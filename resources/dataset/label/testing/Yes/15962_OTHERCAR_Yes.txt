            A year ago my parents bought a 1998 E320 Mercedes benz, following my recommendation.  My parents were in the market to buy a new luxury vehicle because our 1984 500SEL didn't cut it anymore as a car that they could drive to classy, elegant get-togethers.  The 500SEL runs great for a car that's 16 years old.  Of course it takes around 6 turns or so for the engine to start, but it's an old car.  The thing is, it used to run GREAT just a year ago, before we gave it to my sister, who, for the year she had it, never changed the oil, never gave it a wash, never had it serviced, etc.  If they had only give it to me...  before sister: runs GREAT, 75,000 miles.  after sister: dead, 105,000 miles.  $3000 later, the car runs again, and will never fall into her hands again.  Anyway, after the good experience with the 500 SEL, my parents didn't hesitate to buy the E320 when I recommended it.
Well, I don't know exactly what to say and how to say it, so I'll just list it.

1. REALLY comfortable.  I feel numb when I drive this car.  I drove it for a while to break the engine in for my mom.  Also whenever it needs service like an oil change or whatever, I drive it.  I feel a bit scared though because it's so quiet.  I feel like I'm not feeling enough or something. I think it's because I drive a 4Runner.  The steering wheel on the E320 is so much easier to turn, seats are so much more comfortable, a LOT quieter.  You can totally tell that they thought a LOT about every detail when you're sitting in the driver's seat.

2. Powerful.  This thing has POWER.  beautiful graceful burgundy outside.  big old flaming beast under the hood.  I've been sitting at light and have fellow teenagers pull up next to me in their souped up, loud, lowered cars, giving me dirty looks and revving their engines.  They can glower and rev and blast their stereos all they want, but when that light turns green, they're ALWAYS left behind in my exhaust.

3. The stereo!  The Bose system they put in this car is GREAT.  you can turn it way up (if you like it like that) and you ears don't even tell you that something's wrong.  You just feel as if you're more immersed in the soundstage.  The lows, mids and highs are all sharp and precise.  I just wish my mom had gotten the CD changer.  I just spent $2000 on a stereo system for my 4Runner and I don't think it sounds as good as this one.

4. the mirror.  I don't know why, but I just love the auto dimming mirror.  The rearview mirror dims when headlights get too bright behind you and it dims the sideview mirrors, too.  Also, another really neat option the Mercedes has that I wish I had: the right side mirror automatically adjusts down to the ground when you put the car into reverse to help you parallel park and not scratch your wheels on the curb.  I wish I had that in my 4Runner since I'm so high up.

5. traction control.  GREAT traction control system.  I've been in my friend's dad's car when he got into an accident on a rain slicked road.  a Jaguar, too.  The thing just spun around backwards like it was meant to go that way.  left back wheel hit the curb, broke the rim, and we took out a street sign.  scariest thing I've ever experienced.  Well, I wanted to make sure that the Mercedes had a good traction control system, since my mom's kind of a punchy driver.  Well, I took it out when it was raining and kept stepping on the gas a little more each time.   It takes a while for the little yellow exclamation point to start blinking (it tells you when you're losing traction).  even then, you still have complete control of the car.  You can make a 90 degree turn, almost flooring the gas, and the tires just slip a little.  the traction control doesn't allow all the power to go to the wheels.  Well, I wasn't really surprised that it was such a great system.  After all, this IS the company that makes the SUV that can climb a hill when only one wheel has traction.

6. cool key.  They have that data key that doesn't use regular pins and tumblers or whatever like normal cars. The key is real fat and odd shaped.  You stick it into a hole that doesn't look like a keyhole, turn, and the car starts!  It changes the code everytime you start the car.  Oh, and the key has a button to lock and unlock the car, pop the trunk, and a panic button on the end. And if you hold the unlock button down, it opens all the windows and the sunroof. Same for the lock button except it closes everything up.  I wish my car did that.

7. garage opener in the visor.  There's three programmable buttons in the visor on the driver's side.  We have two garages at home so it helps not to have to carry two remotes.  I suppose you can program it for other things like electric gates, lights if your home has remote controlled lights, or maybe a security system for the home (my sister's boyfriend has a remote to arm his house) 

Well, I don't know what else to say.  Just got to say that I love my mom's car.  I drive it whenever I can, obviously.  I'm DEFINITELY going to buy myself one when I'm older.<br><br>
