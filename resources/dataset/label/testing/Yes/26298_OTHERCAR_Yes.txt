            I bought a 2000 Honda Civic Ex 2door in October 1999.  I am throughly impressed.  The vehicle is fantastic.  The car has a sleek look, great handeling and gets great gas mileage.  The suspension is smooth and provides a smooth ride.  I paid $15,600 fillu loaded.  It comes with a factory CD player which for me was a bonus.  I commute to school and work daily and it is a pleasure to do so.  It has plenty of power dure to the 1.6 SOHC VTEC engine.  Everything on the console is user friendly. Stereo, A/C, and cupholders are all within reach.  This is a plus so you are not straining to reach things while driving.  The A/C and heat power up super quick with barely any wait till while you freeze or sweat to death.  This has been my best automobile purchase thusfar in my life.  I really feel like a purchased a winner. <br><br>
