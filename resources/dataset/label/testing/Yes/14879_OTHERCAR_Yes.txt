            I have had my Mavica for over a year.  I use it almost daily to
take pictures for ebay auctions.  The pictures come out clear
and crisp.  It is so easy to pop a 3.5&quot; floppy into the camera,
take a picture, and then upload into the computer.  I have taken
a picture, uploaded and posted to a chat board in 5-6 minutes.  
I use the zoom feature a lot.  If the light is not high enough,
I back up as far as I can, zoom in, and use flash.  The only
negative thing I can say about it is that if you are not careful,
the flash will wash out the picture.  You can check your picture
immediately, however, and delete and re-take if it is not to
your liking.

I was using a lot of film, and paying for a lot of processing before 
I got this camera.  My son has one too, and I love getting pictures
of his new baby girl!!<br><br>
