            Well, I did it.  I purchased my first 'New' car, 2000 Altima SE.  A definite step up from the 95' Mitsibushi Mirage I have been driving around.  After shopping the Mazada 626, Mitsibushi Galant, and the Oldsmobile Alero, I couldn't pass up the the Altima SE with a sunroof.  What I got was a 2000 SE with: ignition immobilizer, 16&quot; low profile tires and alloys, power sunroof, floor mats, and automatic transmission for $19,140 after destination, taxes, tags, and license.  I am pleased with the amenities I got in the car from everything from the 100watt tape/CD player, the keyless entry, to power everything .  I think the car has a peppy 155hp engine especially considering I was driving a 'real' compact for the last few years.  I am a bit dis-heartened by the gas mileage of this car.  In the first 2500 miles I have been averaging 23mi/gal.  I was expecting more from this 4cyl.  In addition, the back seats leave a bit to be desired.  It is roomy considering the compact classification; however, if you wear 11 1/2 shoes like me, plan on having to wedge your feet under the front seats to get in the back.  My final concern is that I ended up paying almost 20k for a car that has a 4cyl.  Maybe I am locked into the 'olden' days and I shouldn't expect that for that kind of money, but I do.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this car and maybe add that upgrading to leather seats would have been total bliss!!!  Hindsight is always 20/20.<br><br>
