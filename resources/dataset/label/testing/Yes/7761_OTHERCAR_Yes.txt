            BMW has always been known for making sporty cars and when you buy a BMW, you are paying for the name. It's a great car, but if you don't care about brand name and just want a car to get you from point A to point B, the BMW is not for you.

The 325i is a driver's car.

The BMW gives you two choices of transmission. Automatic (in a 'steptronic' form letting you shift without the clutch, but this results in slower acceleration times) and manual. Go for the 5-speed.

BMW's clutches tend to be fairly hard and the e46 (code name for the latest generation of 3-series) is about as hard as the e36's (previous generation 3-series) clutch. Likewise, the steering wheel is fairly stiff, but gives you the feeling that you are in control and makes it seems like the car is tough. Nevertheless, shifts are silkly smooth with the 5-speed transmission and the torque powerband is very level, giving you power from the get go, unlike the smaller displacement Japanese engines that need to rev past 4000-5000k on most models to get power.

The car's layout is rear-wheel drive, although you can get all-wheel drive now. The 325's engine has around 180 horses (323i had 170, 328i had 193) while the upscale 330i has around 220. The car has ABS and now comes standard with traction control (ASC).

The interior of the car is beautifully engineered. It's simple. If you are looking to upgrade the sound system, be warned because the switches on the steering wheel will not work with aftermarket sound systems. The car glows a bright orange at night. 

BMW's 3-series come in many packages up here in Canada, and in the USA, there are two packages- sports and luxury. You basically get different rims, springs, shocks and other goodies. A sports packaged BMW may have a stiffer ride, but it will provide you with more enjoyment on the twisties. On the other hand, a premium package BMW has a softer suspension with more amenities suited to city driving. 

The best option to pick when you buy your BMW are the high intensity discharge lights (also called HID, Xenon). They are VERY bright and makes driving at night much easier. It also looks great. The second option I would pick would be the moonroof. It's great cruising on a sunny day with the roof open.

If you have the choice of picking between leatherette and real leather, I would say go for the leatherette because it looks just like leather and most people cannot tell the difference. It also does not crease as much as leather and doesn't have that leather smell. Most importantly, it is also cheaper. I have a friend with a 2000 323i/325i (same engine) he says the leatherette is even easier to clean.

The backseats of the car are not that roomy, but you can fit three small children or two adults in. 

Other car's in the BMW's class include the IS300 by Lexus. It is also a RWD car with an inline-6, but does not come with a manual transmission yet. Audi's new A4 is also competition for the BMW as is Acura's 3.2 TL which will have a new Type-S model out shortly.

In conclusion, the BMW is a car for those that either want to buy it for the image/name (boo!) or for those who want a fun driving sports sedan. Final advice: if you buy a BMW, buy it with a 5-speed manual.
