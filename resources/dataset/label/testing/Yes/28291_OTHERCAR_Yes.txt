            I have been a sport utility driver for years -- long before it became fashionable. After driving Jeeps (for the most part), this is the first time that I have ever owned a Dodge, and I am glad that I made the change. The fit and finish of the truck is amazing. Each piece in the interior comes together as it should and actually is staying in place. The ride is quiet and comfortable. The Infinity cd system rocks. Dodge appears to have overcome the paint problems that has plagued Chrysler (and most other American manufacturers) for years. The exterior finish is lush and rich with no bubbles, pinspots, or swirls. I chose the leather interior and it is most comfortable. I am anxious to find out how it holds up over the weather changes.

The only thing that I don't really like is the way the 5.2l V8 sucks fuel, but then again I do Love the ability to get into a line of traffic easily.

All in all I am very pleased with the vehicle. It provides the testosterone boost that I sorely need each morning to get the day started!<br><br>
