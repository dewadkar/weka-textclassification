            This car is no supermodel. It is a budget car and those who expect Lotus moves and Detroit muscle speed for Yugo prices are going to be upset. The 2003 Nissan Sentra Spec V is, however, the best bang for the buck since the '87-'93 Mustang 5.0. For less than $20k, you get a car that has more features than many cars priced $25k and over, a solid and high revving twin cam 4 cylinder car and handling that equals or bests cars costing $10k more, namely the Subaru WRX, a car that the Spec V doesn't actually compete with on paper, but the similarities are many. 

Comparisons-

I tested the WRX, the VW Jetta 1.8T, the Mazda Protege (the Mazdaspeed Protege was not released as of the time I bought this car), and the Ford Focus. All are great cars and the WRX..well, I have wanted that car since I first laid eyes on it in high school around 1992. Great car with superb handling, very fast, a great reputation and a good warranty. The only problem was the dealers were not (and still are not) marking them down any. The Subaru I wanted, which had extras comparable to the Spec V, was $27,500 out the door. That price included the extended armrests, rear deck spoiler, upgraded speakers, a dealer installed boost gauge, rock guard for the rear differential and a titanium shifter knob. Comparatively, I paid $19,000 out the door for my Spec V with the stereo upgrade, floor mats/in cabin filter and have a power sunroof in the deal. $8500 is a big chunk of change. Besides, Subaru is releasing the STi version soon and who wants the slower one anyway? I had to drive the Focus ZX3, not the SVT as it was not to be found in the Atlanta area when I was shopping and was not floored by the car and have my reservations about all the recalls that have been issued in the past 2-3 years. The Mazda offered great handling but not as great as many of the magazine guys have touted as well as being rather slow (relative to the other sedans/coupes I was looking at). Then there is the Volkswagen. What a car. It handles reasonalby well, not as well as the other cars, but is very comfortable, is fairly quick (as quick as the Spec V actually) and has but one quality issue (the power windows..I hear there is a recall in sight). However, sticker shock brought me down to earth as the VW goes for about as much as the Subaru here in Atlanta. I also had a higher insurance quote for the VW than any of the other cars. I still do not know why. The Spec V was the final car I drove. 

The car, the drive and the purchase-

I made my deposit the day I left the dealership. Why? Let me first get the negatives out of the way. The cupholders are almost useless in the front. Anything larger than a medium drink at Quiktrip will not fit. I think that ABS should be standard or at least offered seperate from the air bags. The sunroof shade has little vents in the front which have no known use and the shade itself seems suspect. Check back with me in 6 months and I'll tell you how it is holding up. The positives? Let's see, the dealer discounted the car over $2k for me. I was able to walk out the door for $19k even including an extended warranty (sticker was $19115 plus ttt which put the car a little over $21700). The car is yellow (the color I wanted) and has all the options but the ABS/Side Impact airbags. This is a car that gets me from point A to point B quickly and with little drama. It has a 6 speed transmission that shifts crisply and a motor that feels good, has plenty of power and, based on the other 4 Nissans I have owned, will last forever (I have a 1979 280ZX with over 300k on the original motor..how, I do not know but I AM a believer in Nissan). 

Other reviews of this car-

I take exception with many other reviewers. I feel that the interior is as should be expected on an economy car. It is nice and quite functional if a bit on the shiny side. There is more than enough room in the car for people over 6'. I had two 6'plus friends of mine in the back seat at one time and they were both comfortable with plenty of head room and just enough leg room. The car is reasonably quiet and I am averaging just over 26 mpg on a green motor that I am admittedly being hard on. In fact, on a 250 mile trip with a little over 100 miles on the car, I averaged 30.2 MPG, 2 mpg more than the EPA estimates. Impressive.

-Is the car a good buy?

Loaded, this car is cheaper than ANY of the competitors (taking into account discounts and a fully optioned car, once again in the Atlanta area where there are no SVT's to be found, the only car that is similiarly priced), has a larger motor (with less torque steer than has been exaggerated about), and is extremely reliable. Nissans are very well built and this car is no exception. Fit and finish is excellent. It is as fuel efficient as any of the others (more efficient than the Subaru in fact). I bought the car because it is the best bang for the buck going. I think it would be a great car for the younger crowd that wants a reliable car without looking like granny driving it. There is bound to be a large aftermarket soon for the car and it is a Nissan so everyone knows it will be livable and reliable for a long time. It has delivered everything I wanted in a car and more.
