            I bought a 1999 extended cab Ford Ranger last March.   For $600, I upgraded to the four door model.   It has proven to be one of the best decisions I have ever made.   Having the extra doors allows for passengers to easily enter the back seats (which face each other giving the back-seat customers more leg room).  It is also nice when just carrying stuff (particularly when it is raining).  From luggage to groceries to my dog, it is very easy to just open the back doors and thow them all in.  

Generally, I am extremely pleased with the truck.   I got the 3.0 liter V-6, as it was on a promotional special at the time.  I don't feel that  the engine has enough power though.   I wish I had spent the extra money and gotten the 4.0 liter engine.   

Also, the optional towing package is very good.  It is a typical 2&quot; receiver.   It is mounted securely and properly on the truck.   The wiring harness is in place.  I feel that the factory installed  towing package is of better quality, looks and value than most aftermarket brands - and it saves you those extra headaches.        <br><br>
