<TEXT>
            I purchased my 1997 Kia Sportage in December 1998.  This is the first car that I have purchased brand new and I must say that while I have been happy with my Sportage, it was a total impulse buy.

I chose to purchase the Sportage because it was reasonably price SUV.  But as the saying goes &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, I am pleased with my Sportage, but let's face it, it is a cheap car.  As far as the performance and Kia's commitment to the warranty goes, I'd rate it as good.  They have repaired everything that I have taken it in for from the check engine light to the clutch (yeah, I was asking myself the same thing, why would a clutch be going on a car that has on 20,000 miles on it.).  Overall, I'd say it is a good car, especially for that teenager that desires a SUV...you don't have to shell out the big bucks.<br><br>
