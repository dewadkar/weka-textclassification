            I enjoy doing using photos of our trips and family gatherings for graphics: calendars, post cards, pictures for display.  I wanted a digital camera to utilize for this hobby at a reasonable price.
I jumped on the opportunity to purchase this item for 160 dollars.  
One factor in choosing this model was a limited cost that matched the resolution of my printer.  Another was the zoom that yields great detail in shooting of my orchids and birds.
The software that comes with the camera is both easy to use and a great deal of fun.  They included more software than I had anticipated.
The first project a group photo from a family gathering did not finish as planned.  I had a nice 8x10 produced on my printer to show a friend at work who is considering a camera also.  Leaving for work I fond my photo missing: my wife had taken it for her office.
The camera has been easy to learn to use.  The functions are quite similar to my 35M camera and they are straight forward.
The camera is solidly built and yet small enough to easily carry.
With the holiday season upon us, this camera will make an excellent gift for all but the very serious photographer. <br><br>
