              The 2000 Tiburon is a great improvement over last years model.  The shark theme caries over and is much more evident this year with bold exterior and interior refinements.  In fact, this car impressed me being a Hyundai with its awesome fit and finish of the exterior panels, refinement for a Korean car, and overall value quotient.
    I am a fan of the beautiful styling of the Tiburon (which looks sweet in Cobalt Blue)and its wild interior.  Its seats were firm, yet comfortable, like in a German car.  The controls are a bit confusing at first, but after a few miles, everything seems to be fine.
    Braking in the Tiburon was a breeze, as pedal modulation was steady and sure.  However I am worried about the ease in which the rear discs seem to want to lock up.  This was on dry pavement, mind you, which makes one wonder how this car would handle in wet or snowy roads.  I must mention though the car I drove was not equipped with ABS, which is optional in the option group 4.
    As for handling and ride, there are no complaints.  It rides firm and no shakes or rattles eminating from the hatch (always promising).    I have read of unconfirmed rumors that Porsche or Lotus helped tune the Tiburons suspension.  Well, I don't really think so after driving other cars which are superior in steering and handling (Civic Si).
   But, overall, the steering is a tad too heavy and numb on the freeway, and ABS is an option i strongly recommend.  This shark can swim!
