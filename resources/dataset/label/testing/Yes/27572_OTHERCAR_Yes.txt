            Purchased new in 1996, my Geo Metro was my second in this particular line of vehicles. I traded in a 1988 Sprint (same vehicle as the Geo, just a different name) so obviously I was favorably inclined to begin with. I bought both for basic economical transportation and have not been disappointed. I love the gas mileage, something I can smirk about when gasoline prices rise. The smirk factor is a part of being able to fit into teeny parking places and to whip around in less space than it takes to swing a cat, too. The front seats are surprisingly comfortable, even on long trips, but I wouldn't carry anything larger than a pug dog in the back seat.

Needless to say, I'm on the receiving end of others' smirks when I don't have enough power to maintain speed going uphill, but since I don't take myself too seriously, I can live with it. That great gas mileage suffers a bit when I use the air conditioner, but I can live with that, too. There is no room for normal sized adults in the back seat, but I have a larger automobile for when I need to transport someone other than myself.

Driving my Geo on the highway is rather like blowing down the road in a paper bag. The blast of wind from a passing semi can certainly keep me from dozing off at the wheel. Around town, though, I can zip in and out 
of tight spots like a hummingbird in a florist's shop.

Anyone considering purchasing a Geo Metro needs to be aware of its drawbacks as well as its benefits. It is a relatively inexpensive car both to purchase and drive, thus suitable for a single person or couple on a budget.
I can't seriously recommend it as a family vehicle due to its limited space.
