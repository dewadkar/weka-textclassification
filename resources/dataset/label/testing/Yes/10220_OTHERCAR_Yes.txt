            I own a 1999 Lexus RX 300 and I love it. I purchased this vehicle because I am self employed and I entertain clients often. I was previously driving a Toyota Tercel and did not like the small business look it gave me when interfacing with my customers. I wanted something that was roomy yet compact. That is exactly what I got. I love the comfort of a big SUV without the difficult manuvering aspect or gas consumption. Additionally I have the convenience of a SUV while maintaining the luxury style. I have leather seats, a moonroof, digital read out screen that everyone always ask is it a TV, I have a 6 CD changer, power EVERYTHING, and rear wipers. I was going to buy the Mercedes M class but the car was more expensive and so was maintenance. I spend about $60 for an oil change whereas an oil change on a Mercedes is closer to $200. It also has more cargo space than the Mercedes M class. The seats are very comfortable and there is a lot of leg space. I rode in the back seat once and was amazed to find that the back seats not only fold down for additional cargo, but for road trips, they also recline and slide forward. 

I like sitting up off the ground and the overall luxury and feel of my truck. I have always driven Toyotas and trusted their reputation and if you did not know already, Lexus is made by Toyota. When me and the girls are out on the town, we definately turn heads.   

My only complaint would be that it has about a 14 gallon tank so at first it seemed like I was putting gas in it everyday. It is my primary vehicle but we have now gotten adjusted to each other.    <br><br>
