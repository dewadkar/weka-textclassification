            The real reason I won't buy a new Plymouth Voyager is really quite simple! 

The reason is this; I can't seem to wear out the old 1991 Plymouth Voyager. Boy, I've got to tell you, this is beyond a doubt the absolute finest vehicle I have ever owned, bar none.  As a young man, I had always followed in my daddy's footsteps. He was a G.M. man, so therefore I was a G.M. man. Hey, if it's good enough for pop, it's good enough for me.

When I got a little older I decided to try out the old Fix Or Repair Daily or maybe you are more familiar with Found  On Road Dead.  Yes, that's it; F.O.R.D. My relationship with the Ford products was short lived to say the least.  Except for their trucks.  I feel they do put out a good truck for the most part.

Now from Chevy to Ford and now on to imports: Toyota, Audi,  Honda everything but Chrysler, where was my head ? What was I thinking?
How could I just skip right by them blindly as if they never existed? Hmmmm I just don't know.  Then one day while driving into town in my Audi, it had one of it's weekly problems; this time an electrical short which brought us to a sudden stop in the middle of the road.  I had a  sudden realization that I was just going to have to break down and buy a new car or a newer used car.  We pushed the dead Audi into a K-mart parking lot and bid  bon-voyage to our old piece of ----Audi and flagged down a cab and said &quot;closest car dealership around please and hurry!&quot;
Thank goodness it was a Chrysler dealership.  The rest is history!

We purchased a 1991 Plymouth Voyager with about 28,000 miles on it and lived happily ever after.  Seriously, we are enjoying our Plymouth Voyager till this day and that was back in 1992.  We now have 123,000 miles on it and outside of changing the drive belts at regular intervals and keeping clean oil and filters, I spend my time driving it instead of working on it.  In closing, I just can't say enough about the Plymouth Voyager that we purchased almost 10 years ago.  This minivan drives and looks just about as good as it did when we purchased it and like I said before that was about 100,000 miles and 10 years ago.  So I guess I won't be buying a new car soon, however when we do decide to buy one again, you can bet your money that I will be looking awfully long and hard at the new Plymouth Voyager. <br><br>
