            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lot of vehicle for the money.  I originally bought my Jeep to provide more room for my two growing boys.  They are involved in several sports with an extraordinary amount of equipment to haul around. The Jeep provides me with plenty of room, and plenty of room in the back seats as well, two adolescent boys and their friends fit comfortably.  

The V-8 with automatic 4-wheel drive gives me peace of mind, especially with our snowy winters in Ohio.  There is also an extra space for luggage with the rack on the top, which comes in handy with family vacations.

I have heated leather seats, which is a godsend on cold or chilly mornings.  The heating/air conditioning system for the Jeep is adequate, letting the passengers in the rear of the vehicle get ample heat/air as well as in the front.  Gas mileage is approximately 15mpg in the city, although, I have gotten 22mpg on the highway during vacations.

I personally have never had a problem with this model that couldn't be taken care of promptly at the dealership.  I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who is concerned with room, dependability, and value.  This is maximum vehicle for the price.  Well worth the investment.  <br><br>
