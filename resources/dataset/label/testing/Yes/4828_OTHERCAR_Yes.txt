            Well, recently my family rented the 2000 LHS for our trip to houston... we figured we're going to be in this car for at least 5 hours at a time for the drive (we live in dallas) well, the front is great, its got all
these nifty buttons and gizmos and the gauges are pretty cool looking,
somewhat retro to a point, when the headlights were on they had this
indiglo thing going on, and that was pretty cool. The stereo was awesome too, it had the built in cd-player and the sound was better than my home stereo. The back seat was quite uncomfortable, mainly because the seats weren't broken in yet, but none the less after the 12th hour they were a little more comfy than when we first started. There is plenty of room for 4 full size adults (i honestly dont know where that term came from) The navigational system was really cool too, you always know which direction you are going. There is also an option to tell you what the temperature outside is (way cool) and how many miles you can go on what gas you have left, as well as miles per gallon you are getting at any given moment. The trunk is huge as well, we could have fit much more stuff in there than we did and still have had room. It was a nice ride, the passenger seat even has an electronic control for the perfect seat adjustment. The only thing I didnt like about this car was after reading the owners manual, I wouldnt buy one because the key has to be programmed to the car, and its a really wierd process... dont lose your key :) You can also program the 3 buttons on the navigational system to be like garage door openers. (that was good)
The key thing was just.. umm.. odd :) But its great so noone can go make copies of your keys, and if the key isnt the right one, the car won't start. (sounds lame I know becuase normally if you have the wrong key it wont start.. but this one will start for like 10 seconds then shut off)
After the 3rd attempt with the wrong key it will lock up like your bank locking up your atm card after the 3rd wrong pin entry. (I dont know this from first hand experience, I just read the book when I got bored)
This is a good car, but its way expensive, Ill stay with my camry, it has most of the same stuff :)<br><br>
