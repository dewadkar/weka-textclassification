            We leased our 2000 Dodge Durango in November 1999 and promptly fell in love with this vehicle. Our previous vehicle was a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan, which our family adored. We definitely wanted another Dodge because we had survived a horrible accident. In 1996, our new 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan was totaled but our family was safe. After the crash, we bought our second Grand Caravan, because we didn't want to take any chances with safety.

Based on this experience, we wanted another Dodge. While shopping for another Grand Caravan we were very disappointed with the deals. Numerous family and friends told us to also check out the Durango. To appease them, we checked it our and discovered that we liked it also. We were given a much better deal for the Durango than for the Caravan and decided to lease it. We also looked at the truck online at http://www.4adodge.com/durango. DaimlerChrysler Motors Corporation can be contacted at 1-800-442-2666.

Why we love our Durango

The exterior is beefy looking, so it really appealed to Hubby and me. This truck is very durable and we feel safe driving our children around in it. It sits a couple of inches higher than the Grand Caravan and feels much sturdier. There is also much less sway while driving around turns. We needed a powerful vehicle a where we live, on a small but steep mountain in the Northeast and the Durango fits the bill with 4 x 4 and V8 engine. It's great for the winter with all the snow we get because the 17&quot; tires are big enough to drive through any road condition. Even in rough conditions, this truck rides pretty smooth, much like my old Grand Caravan. Performance levels for our truck are listed as: Peak Horsepower- 235 h,p./4800 rpm and Peak Torque- 295 ft-lb/3200 rpm.

The dashboard gauges are clear and easy to read. The cassette AM/FM stereo is in close reach to the driver and has 8 speakers scattered about the truck. The passenger side glove box is under the airbag a nice size and can hold a few items. The consol between the front seats holds 3 beverages (2 different sizes) and the armrest opens to reveal a small change holder and storage space for tapes or wallets. The back of the console has 2 vents for the back passengers. Behind the cloth front seats are pouches to hold books or maps. There is ample headroom throughout the truck and the ceiling lights are operated by pressing the light.

My favorite feature

We bought the SLT package, which has a driver's power adjustable seat that raises or lowers the driver as well as move forward and back. This is ideal for us because we can adjust it with the touch of a couple of buttons on the side of the seat. Hubby likes the seat far back and lower down, while I need the seat closer and much higher. I am 5' 2&quot; while Hubby is 5' 6&quot;, so this is a nice convenience to have in our truck.

More stuff!

Also included in our SLT package are: ABS, airbags, speed control, power steering, rear wiper blades and rear window defroster, oversized heated side mirrors that fold in, fog lamps, 150 pound capacity roof rack, power door locks, child safety locks on back doors, running boards, assist handles and remote keyless entry. Another nice feature is the power outlet located in the cargo area, along with the one on the dashboard. The covered spare tire well is accessed through the cargo area and contains a full size tire and jack. 

I thought this was an 8-seater!

We decided to get the Durango with the extra seat in the back because our 2 children sit in car seats. The set up would be 2 front bucket seats, a split middle bench seat that holds 3 and a back bench seat that hold another 3 passengers. The kids' car seats sit in the middle with plenty of room between them but not enough for anyone to sit there. Since the seat splits we can fold the back down to let the kids use the cup holders. The kids car seats do not fit securely in the back seat so when there are extra people in this truck, I usually have to sit in back with another small passenger. 

The biggest hassle with this is that adults can't get into the far back seat without: 

A) Climbing over or between the children's car seats. This is normally what we do when its my sister and me heading for the back seat. 
B) Completely removing one child's car seat and then folding down the seat to access the back. The &quot;fold and tumble&quot; approach rarely gets done because it's the biggest hassle to get the car seat back in securely.
C) Climbing over the far back seat via the trunk cargo area. This is the best way to get weird looks from strangers! 

I was originally worried about not having as much room in the back because that seat is small lengthwise. I was right. Anyone with long legs or taller than me won't feel comfortable back there. When I am driving, my 6-foot tall brother has to sit sideways and gets queasy from the bumpy ride. When we have other people travel with us and Hubby is driving, I sit in the back since I'm usually the smallest adult and actually like the bumps.

Glug, glug, glugï¿½

Another drawback about my Dodge Durango is that our gas bill has increased by 40 percent, before the recent gas crunch. This truck has a 25-gallon gas tank and watching it fill up at the gas station can be a worrisome activity. I'm not surprised when the bill hits close to $30 so I never leave home with out extra money or a gas card. Luckily, I don't drive far very often. According the to Fuel Mileage Information Estimated fuel cost was listed at $1201, city mpg is 14 and highway mpg is 18. This is why Hubby's commuting car is a Volkswagen GTI.

Finally!

Driving this SUV is a pleasure and I feel safe and secure with my kids in the back seat. We are able to drive in all kinds of rainy and snowy weather, without worrying as much as we used to. Even though our Durango does love it's gas and is a little crampy in back, we will gladly keep feeding it and recommending it because it has served our family so well.
