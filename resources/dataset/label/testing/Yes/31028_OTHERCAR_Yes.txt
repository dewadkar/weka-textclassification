            I had been looking at PT Cruisers when I first saw the 2002 Sebring Coupe LXi and immediately knew THAT was the car I wanted.  The exterior styling is very sporty.  The 17" alloy rims with low profile Goodyear Eagles not only increase the handling performance, but make the car look even that much better.  The Coupe is far and away the best looking in the Sebring line-up.

I bought the fully loaded 2002 with 17" rims, 3.0L 200 HP engine, 4 speed automatic, and despite my 6'3" 240pound frame, this is an extremely fun car to drive.  The 200 HP engine provides plenty of power for this size car.  75 MPH?  Only when I try to keep the speed DOWN...  For a "luxury sport coupe" this car handles extremely well.  The 17" rims help it stick to the road in tight high speed turns. 

I also like the interior design.  The instruments are easy to read with orange background lighting.  Everything, radio/CD controls, climate control, lights, wipers, you name it are easy to reach and use.  It comes with Tach, and temp gauges but I wish it also had an oil pressure gauge and volt meter or ammeter.  

My only complaint about this car is the headroom.  However, there are very few cars for which I don't have that concern.  To compensate, I recline the seat a little farther than I might normally prefer.  I suppose another complaint some people may voice is over the cramped back seat leg room.  However, this is a coupe...  If you are planning on carrying people regularly, this is not the car to buy.

I'm sure this review sounds like it was written by a dealer but I'm not.  I'm just a very satisfied owner.  I've had the car for six months and I already have 12,000 miles on it.  Obviously I enjoy driving it...
