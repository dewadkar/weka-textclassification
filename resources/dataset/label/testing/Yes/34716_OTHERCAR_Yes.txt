            We bought our 1990 Oldsmobile 98 Regency Brougham in November of 1991. We started out looking at mini-vans. When the wife spotted our dark blue beauty sitting there on the lot she fell in love with it. It had about 23,000 miles on it and was loaded with every option available for the Regency with the exception of the sunroof. We struck a deal and drove it home.

My wife has used this car for carrying kids back and forth to school and for daily errands for the past 10 years. We've taken it on vacation and it has been a great car for traveling. You can keep track of your mileage traveled, RPMs, travel distance, oil change interval, temperature, etc. on a digital display on the dash. The automatic climate control has been a nice feature as well as a power passenger seat. After we first bought the car a neighbor thought we had purchased a new Cadillac. The interior is very plush and the seats are very comfortable. The velour seats have held up extremely well with hardly any signs of wear. The interior is spacious and both those in the front and rear have ample legroom.

The car�s electronic gadgets are also its weakness. The previous owner had the power antenna replaced under warranty.  Over the years I have had to replace the alternator, starter motor, remote entry receiver, passenger side window motor, radiator, and worst of all, the automatic transmission (around 90K miles).

The car now has 114,000 miles on it and it still looks and runs good. The 3.8 liter engine still runs strong. Even though it is 11 years old, it still has dignity.
 
If you don�t mind having to run to the repair shop on an occasional basis for some sort of electrical problem, this may be the car for you.
