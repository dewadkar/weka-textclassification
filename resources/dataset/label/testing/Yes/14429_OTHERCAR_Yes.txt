            I came across this vehicle on a used car lot about 6 months ago, was needing a replacement for my Pontiac Firebird, and wanted something bigger, and could haul, well...you know...STUFF. Man, can this thing do that. Got one with the regular cab, 3.9 Magnum V-6, auto, anti-lock power brakes, power steering and AM/FM cassette. I switched out the stereo for an AM/FM cd player, and did nothing else. The previous owner kept this truck immaculate, only 26,000 miles on her, clean inside, under the hood and underneath, no paint scratches, no dents, and everything works. I have since driven about 7,000 miles and hauled furniture, appliances, boxes, wood, you name it, and this truck won't flinch, haul it up any grade, from a standstill, without grunting, and even the heaviest load that I've put on her, about 1500 pounds didn't seem to drop the back end. This truck is awesome and it's the best vehicle I've owned since the first car I ever owned, a 1976 Olds Cutlass. I test drove a Chevy S-10 with the extended cab and the 4.3 liter V-6, and while the power felt comparable, the Dodge feels more car like than the Chevy, despite sitting up higher. The steering is light years more responsive, the brakes modulate better and while they currently need replacement, don't appear to fade after long, loaded trips down severe grades. Unloaded, this truck has beaten every other truck I can find off the line, and will beat most trucks, and a surprising number of cars, from any one red light to the next. It picks up speed for passing on the interstate quickly, and corners like a mad-dog. I do suggest one thing though, if you have the P215-75R-15 package, and don't want to change the rims, move to P225-70R-15's. I put a set of Goodyear Eagle GT II's on after quickly wearing out the cheap Goodyear Invicta  and HOLY COW, what a great, rather cheap, improvement. The handling of the truck and those tires seem well-matched, if you're not headed off-road, which I'm not. I will do some minor improvements to this truck, but for the first time since that Cutlass, that I don't want, nor do I feel I need, a more powerful engine. Nor do I have the urge to change out the gearing for more response. This truck has done everything asked of it so far, and more will be asked, no doubt about that. Dodge has built the &quot;small truck&quot; to beat, and nobody can, at least right now. We'll find out in about 2 years, when I ready to make a trade, but I am the happiest driver I've been in years<br><br>
