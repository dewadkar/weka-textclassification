            When i first saw a Twin Turbo Supra in real life i was taken aback. What is this ? It resembles nothing i had ever seen. The front was shark like and sleek. And that huge wing ? Whats up with that ? It actually provides real downforce i later found out. THe twin turbo Supra was Toyotas answer to the Nissan 300zx and the 3000GT twin turbo. In stock form it beat the other cars in almost every catagory. It was pricey and in my opinion came a bit too late. Its a shame though because this car was built to be a winner.


Toyota got everything right. The engine was a mountain of power, the handling superlative and the brakes !!! Who could ask for better brakes ? Huge rotors and calipers up fron with wide tires gave it stopping power rivaling the AWD porche 911. THe best part was the explosive power. Wait for 3000 rpm till the 2nd turbo kicks in and you are almost launched into orbit. 

Not only was the supra a killer when it came out in mid 93 but till today it is the best handling, most modifiable and relatively cheap car for sports car enthusiasts in the US. THe only cars that compare to it cost about 2 times as much.

This car is for those people that want the best of both worlds. Exotic performance at economy prices. This car is highly modifiable and does very well in import drag racing so its rare to find a good example at a cheap price. I would suggest the automatic for those people looking for drag racing as the supra auto is very robust and actually faster than the 6 speed. Also after modifications the automatic ends up being cheaper to upgrade because the twin plate clutch in the manual is very expensive to replace.
