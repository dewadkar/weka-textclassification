            Got my 5 door Landcruiser Colorado in the UK, all 3.5 tonnes of off-road badness...Its 3.0l Turbo Diesel engine provides a more than adequate 123 bhp and 218 lbft of torque, that allows it to tackle some of the hardest terrain. And also gives its max speed of 99 mph (which can be increased to 110mph by using the &quot;ect power&quot; and &quot;Overdrive&quot; settings correctly)

For 29243 pounds (approx 35000 dollars), it came with more features than most 4x4's, Front, Centre and Rear differential locking, ABS, Power Steering, Electric Windows, Central Locking, Air conditioning, CD Player and more.

Although a very cumbersome vehicle with excellent off road control, the Landcruiser has all the features to make it easy for even a novice driver to use off road. The Locking Rear Differentials can be used to free the vehicle if one of the rear wheels is spinning. There are 3 different 4x4 settings available that are useful for different driving conditions. The High speed setting is used for normal driving, The High speed with locked centre differential can be used for wet and icy roads, and also for towing and hill climbing, and light off road driving. The Low speed with locked centre differential setting is used for serious off road driving.

The Landcruiser inside is very spacious and very comfortable, with seating for 7, there is still enough legroom to not feel at all cramped. Also the rear two seats fold away to the sides of the vehicle, giving a massive amount of storage space.

The only major drawback of this vehicle is the fuel consumption, I generally get 350 miles to a tank of diesel that costs between 50 and 60 pounds to fill in the UK, significantly more expensive than in the US I expect. But apart from that a brilliant car.

The Landcruiser is ideal for those who require a strong sturdy and reliable off road vehicle that wont under-perform or look out of place on normal roads, but not a good choice of vehicle for those who plan to use it as an economical city run-around vehicle.<br><br>
