            When I purchased a '96 Jeep Grand Laredo to replace my '92 Jeep Cherokee Sport, I lucked into a real bargain. It's a steel-grey wonder with leather, caramel-colored interior. Every gadget known to mankind is included in the package and the lines of the car haven't aged. Translation: The fella down the street owns a '98 model and thought mine was a '98, too!

Except that he paid ten &quot;grand&quot; more for his!

This is a solid truck that handles like a car. My wife loves it and I love it when she's rolling down the road in it because I don't need the official lab results to know that it's safer than what she's driving (a much smaller Toyota product.

I also enjoy my Laredo because, unlike some of the taller Ford and Chevy products on the market, it is somewhat understated. Yes, I know what you're thinking: He can't put six people in it. But, whoa just a moment, because I CAN! Yes, just learned through a hunting catalog that they make a third seat that fits in the back. Costs about $200 for the seat and half as much to install it. 'might just try it. Anyway, it might present an option for those like me who can't afford something like a Ford Expedition or Lincoln Navigator.

Finally, if you're not convinced that this is a good set of wheels, try this experiment: Go to a Ford dealer and ask to drive and PARK an Expedition or Navigator. Following your experience there, visit a Chrysler dealer and take a Laredo for a spin. Then, PARK IT! Compare the experience and imagine how many times you will be parking your auto over the next few years. Wow, I can still remember trying to park the Navigator!
