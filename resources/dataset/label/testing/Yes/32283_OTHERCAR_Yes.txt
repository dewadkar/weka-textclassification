            This review is based on my search and finding what I believe was the perfect digital camera for me.  I enjoy photography, I am by no means a professional, however I do play alot with film cameras, scanners, and imaging programs.  I will not give you all the specifications, thats not why you are here, if you are like me you have done all the research and now want to know does it do what it proclaims in the ads. YES IT DOES, and I mean it.  The exposure system is this camera is one of the best, a 256 element matrix metering system that is almost impossible to fool.  On automatic, you will be amazed at just how well this camera makes you an excellent photographer.

Yes, there are tons of menus, and functions gallore, read the manual and learn.  It does what all the others do and More. IT beats the Canons, HPs, Fuji's, and Olympus models and I even mean the Canon G1 and the 10 Olympus.

The flash has been raised on this model over the 990 and redeye is reduced. It has several advantages over the 990 so if you dont have a Nikon yet, get this one. If you have the 990, it may not be worth the upgrade, unless you want the latest and greatest. The 995 is faster than the 990, improves on tiff file format, and the white balance has been extreamly improved.

I love the camera, My Nikon N70 (film) has been sitting on the table for awhile now. I don't see myself picking it up soon.  By the way, if you get this camera, get a great photoprinter. Epson, Canon, and HP's newer models do some justice to almost getting to photographic quality.

Until next time
Brad
