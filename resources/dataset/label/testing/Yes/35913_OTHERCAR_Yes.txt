                The 1991 MR2 is a classic sports car in its own right. Everything about the sports coupe oozes classic, from its styling to its performance. It is definitely unique and a pure joy to drive.
    The MR2 was a concept that Toyota bought from Lotus. With just that bit of information, one can only imagine what this car can do. The midengine design was not only a revolutionary concept by Toyota but an ingenious one. The rear wheel drive of this car just kicks. I personally own the 2.2 liter non-turbo so you can imagine what a turbo must feel like. The MR2 has an unmatched amount of low end torque making it terribly fun to drive around the city. I have driven many sports cars with even higher amounts of horsepower (135-140) but none compare to the amount of torque and kick that the MR2 produces. The handling of this car is like that of a go-kart. You have the utter confidence of taking almost any turn at high speeds. The car remains solid and never slips. The MR2 was never meant to be driven slow or conservative. In low speeds the car just pleads to be driven faster. The throaty sound of the exhaust just begs you to stomp on the gas. On long range trips i can get 30 miles to the gallon so this car isn't a gas guzzler by any means.
   The styling of the MR2 was beyond its time. Look at the 91 Camry or 91 Celica. You can't tell me that they are from the same family or even built in the same year. From the side vents to the sleek nose, I have gotten many comments of amazement of how this car can be from 1991. The interior is sufficient for me. The car is a true two seater, a genuine stamp of a real sports car. The trunk space is enough room for baggage for two which is all i really need anyways. There have been many complaints about the size of the interior but I personally have no complaints. If you put a back seat and more room, the MR2 wouldn't be an MR2 anymore. 
    If you take a good look on the road, there aren't many MR2s. The reason is its limited production. Unlike the Integra or Celica, the MR2 is quite a rare and unique sight. If you are thinking about buying an MR2 and are not sure, test drive it. You will be convinced. There definitely is some hustle behind the stylish two seating driving machine.
