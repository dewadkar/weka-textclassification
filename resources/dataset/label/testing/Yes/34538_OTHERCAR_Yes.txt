            My husband and I bought this camera so we could send pictures to our family out of state.  I absolutely love this camera.  It shows very clear photos when we send them in email.  Now we have a little girl and we take pictures of her all the time and send them.  The only thing I say is get rechargeable batteries because if you use the part where you can view the pics then you will use a lot of batteries.  The other thing I like about this camera is if you don't like the picture you just took then you can erase it and start over.<br><br>
