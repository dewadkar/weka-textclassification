<TEXT>
            I got a 1991 Honda Accord as a gift about a year and a half ago, I wasn't about to turn down a car used or not.  I've put about 40,000 miles on it since then (it now has 170,000 miles) and there still aren't any big problems.  The engine isn't loud, it doesn't burn a lot of oil, it hasn't broken down on me (knock on wood), and it still gets 20 to 27 miles per gallon.  Other than basic maintenance it hasn't been a big investment.  

I've never driven an Accord with an automatic transmission so I can't vouch for them, but the ones I've driven have a decent amount of pickup.  It handles well at higher speeds and  grips the road better than most cars I've driven.  I really wish it was front wheel drive, I guess that's the only beef I have.  It doesn't handle bad in the snow unless you're driving up an icy hill, but what car does?  

If you want a reliable car that gets good gas mileage but still has a &quot;sporty&quot; feel I'd recommend an accord.  I'm buying a new one if this one ever blows up.<br><br>
