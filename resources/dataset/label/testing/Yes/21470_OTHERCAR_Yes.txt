            I have owned about a dozen cars, and all of them were sports cars such as RX7's, Camaros, etc.  I bought my original Mark Viii for a great deal, not because I figured it had much on the other cars I used to have.  But, it does have something on those cars... and in a big way.  

This car, when in good repair, is INCREDIBLE in the comfort department.  Nice leather seats with enough adjustments to make someone with a fused spine happy.  Most cars come completely loaded, including a fairly ok JBL audio system, and a huge moonroof.  

This is a big car, which can look rather grandpaish depending on the color.  The engine is very quiet, until you floor it.  Then it produces a great growl of 280 horses and 285 foot pounds of torque.  The size is an advantage, depending.  My original car got totalled 2 weeks after buying it when someone slammed into my back end at 60kms.  (About 40 mph I think).  I walked away unscathed, although the car wouldn't run any more.  I figure if I was in a Chevy sprint, I might not have been typing this.  I liked the car so much, I bought another one 2 weeks later.

So, in detailed point form.... 
GOOD POINTS:
Lots of power.  0-60 in about 7 seconds with an automatic and 3700 lb car is pretty impressive.
Nice big power moonroof.
Best highway car ever.
Stylish, sleek, original body.
Spaceship-like cockpit.
Nice, comfortable, adjustable seating.
Great highway mileage.
Decent stock stereo system.  (JBL was optional, but on nearly ALL of produced.)
Stock keyless entry with alarm.
Loaded, including seats the move forward when the backs are tilted forward.
Pretty good steering radius for such a large car.

CONS:
Mileage isn't great in the city.  But it's not horrendous.
Parts can be expensive.  Air ride suspension is crazy expensive to fix. Parts aren't easy to find cheap/used, since this car is rare.  
I question if all the parts used are of acceptable quality.  The seats wear in areas, and the dash/door panels are plastic and sub-standard.
This car isn't great in poor weather.  I will try it for the first time in the snow this winter.  Wish me luck.
HEADLIGHTS ARE HORRIBLE!  These cars are known for overheating headlights.  This burns the reflective material inside, and makes them nearly useless.  A must-check when buying this car.
Large car is hard to part.
Blind spots are not very welcome.

Overall impression: This car has some definate quirks, and won't be for everyone.  But if you want a great cruising car, this might just be it.  Great for all ages, but if you're young, avoid the standard colors.  Especially dark ones.  (You'd think black would look cool, but it looks more classy instead)
