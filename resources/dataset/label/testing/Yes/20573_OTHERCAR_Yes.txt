            1998 was a very memorable year for me. I graduated from graduate school, got a decent job even though I was still working during graduate school. I drove SUV by then and I really enjoyed it, except the high fuel cost at a tight budget. With a typical college social life style, my friends always called me whenever they move, when they find a cheap couch, when they go skiing, bike riding, etc. 

Surely, it was a great time of my life, but I had to move on. By that time, too many people were driving SUV, I had to get out of the main stream and come up with my own style. Especially, getting out of school, I felt I needed to reward myself with a new car. 

Enough with my background, I wasn't sure what other car I should drive. I didn't care much about changes in car market so long (Did I mention that I drove the SUV for 8 years?). I started to categorize my demand. 
Number one, reliability. 
Number two, mid size.
Number three, style (not too popular).

I even thought about getting BMW and AUDI, but I wanted to drive, somehow, less driven, but still reliable. It didn't took me too much time until I decided to go with CL. I actually visited several used car dealership to get a feel of resale values of several candidates. There, I found one CL and the resale value was great. I even tried driving the year old CL, couldn't complain.

The next day, I was in a Acura dealership negotiating the price of CL 2.3. I wanted automatic. Even though I really love stick shift, my fiancee(my wife now) didn't know what to do with it. I wanted leather seat by default, since the 2.3 automatic only comes with leather seat. Other than that, every option I could think of came with standard. Sunroof, CD stereo, remote keyless entry all included. I didn't want 3.0 V6 since I thought that car is small and light enough with 2.3 engine.

Ever since then, my experience with CL was great. It's smooth, responsive, quiet, not to mention great style. Just escaping out of SUV world, the low profile of car for me was little strange, but I got used to it with this comfy leather seat. 

Only problem I had is the automatic shift. It's usually o.k. But when I step fast on the gas pedal at around 30 to 40 mile range the gear changes to too low gear, and gets no acceleration for about a half second, then it changes to the proper gear, accelerates.

Other than that it's o.k. After about 30,000 miles of driving, I learned how to avoid the weird gear shift. In usual stop and go traffic, it accelerates fast enough I can feel the power of acceleration if I push gas pedal little hard.

Stereo system is fine. It came with CD player only. I sometimes wish I had a CD exchanger but I don't drive this car more than an hour every day. The sound quality is o.k. I don't think the sound is crispy enough at very high end and very low end of frequency, but I listen rock, jazz, classical without missing much of quality. The sound quality is warm enough, unless I pump up the volume too much. The remote control for stereo at the steering wheel is a bonus I enjoy. I can concentrate on my driving while I have some control on my music, or even smoking (I know, shame on me).

One other nice gadget is the Homelink that replaces garage door opener. I never found safe, reasonable place for garage door opener. It helped me solving the problem. However, I don't think it's powerful enough. I always have to get close to the door open my garage door. The rubber button is somewhat small. I always have to push it hard, now the plastic around it has some crack.

Trunk is big enough for the size of car. It isn't as huge as full size car, but I somehow managed carrying my radio control yacht(5ft high), and mid size model airplane. The hole through the armrest on the back seat helps a lot. Not just for the carrying ski, but I can throw my garbage to the trunk and make passenger room cleaner. However, I couldn't put babysit when we just had a baby. I managed to put in babysit on the back sit, but I had to move my seat forward all the way(I'm 6ft tall). As you can imagine from the look of the car ( I think it's still conservative style though.) this is not the kind of car that can grow with your family.

I brought this car to dealership twice. After 2 and a half year's of driving, automatic driver side window did not work. I brought it to the dealership on same day, and it was fixed within an hour. It didn't cost me anything except my time. The other time was about dead battery, but I live in Arizona. It's not surprising for any driver in this area.

My CL is now almost 3 years old. It still looks great, runs great, virtually looks like new. It will be hard to distinguish between brand new and mine, well, maybe. Acura doesn't make same model any more. They made a hyped version of CL with bigger engine and bigger body. I'm glad that I was able to get CL while it was just about right size and price for my needs. 

As far as I drive this car only to work for myself, and have a separate family car, I'll be able to keep it long time. Maybe for 10 years? I think this car will be still reliable, classy, stylish, economic(well after I payoff) after 10 years.
