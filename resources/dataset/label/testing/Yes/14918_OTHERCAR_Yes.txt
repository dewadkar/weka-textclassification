            A couple of years ago my parents bought me a digital camera for Christmas. It is just like the Sony FD71, just a little different by the lense is all. They thought it would help me with my career or something I guess (I am going to school to be a journalist). It doesn't really matter why they bought this for me, because I really love it! We are always taking pictures and sending them by email to people really fast. 

Using a camera with a 3.5 disk inside is much easier than those other digital cameras that have to have a memory chip and you have to wait to upload them into your computer. Those just take toooooo much time! I remember I used one of those for a little while and was constantly frustrated. 

There isn't much to hate about this camera, except when your battery runs out in a really good picture taking place :). That isn't really the camera's fault, though. More like the owners because they didn't check the battery pack, opps. 

I would recommend this camera for families who do a lot of traveling or a lot of picture taking. Because this camera is so expensive, I would not recommend it for people who do not take a lot of pictures or go a lot of places where a camera might be needed. In all, this is a great thing to have! <br><br>
