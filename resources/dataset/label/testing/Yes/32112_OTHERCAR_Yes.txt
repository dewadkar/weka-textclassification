            I purchased my 2000 300M in October 1999. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience with the following exceptions:

At 2000 miles, the car began pulling to the left. Had alignment checked, all was well. Problem was determined to be &quot;Radial Pull&quot; from the front left Good Year Eagle LS.  Took car to Good Year Dealer and tire was replaced free of charge. Problem solved. 

At 6000 miles, same problem, different tire, same solution. 

At 11000 miles same problem and a front end shimmy to boot. I was now fed up with replacing one poorly designed tire with another, and replaced all four with Continentals and realigned. Problem cured. Car also rides more smoothly and quietly, and seems to handle better.  

At 11500 miles the parking brake pedal goes to the floor, and service brakes are fading once heated up. 

Take vehicle to Riverside Chrysler in CA and describe problem. 

They charge me $68 to tell me that it is my fault as I have been driving with the parking brake applied. I am informed that it will cost me $240 in labor plus parts to replace the parking brake shoes and that they cannot even look at the service brake issue until I pay for the work on the parking brakes. 

I inform him that I have NOT been driving with the parking brake applied and want the diagnosis reviewed. No cooperation from dealer. I inform the dealer to put the car back together and not to touch it further. 

Escalate my problem to Chrysler Customer service. They inform me that &quot;they stand behind their dealers&quot; (read that... buzz off!).  

Take car to an independent mechanic who replaces factory brake pads with ceramic (factory pads still had plenty of meat left on them), resurfaces rotors, and installs parking brake shoes. Passenger side parking brake shoe material had broken away from backing, yet drivers side looked like new (must have been driving with only one side of the parking bakes applied).  

Fade problem resolved, Parking brakes operational. I will be checking parking brakes more often to find if problem starts to recur.  

Epilogue:

Still love the car, original tires stink, root of parking brake problem still undetermined. &quot;Five-star&quot; service (at least with this dealer) leaves a lot to be desired. Chrysler &quot;customer service&quot; not of much service.
