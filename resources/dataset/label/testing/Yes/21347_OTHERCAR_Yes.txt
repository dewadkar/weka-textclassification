            I bought a '99 Camry because of the new sleeker design that Toyota came out with. I owned a '96 prior to buying the '99. Good things first:  The '99 is a much smoother and quieter riding car. Seems like there is more room all over. Visibility has improved. Don't know what they did to the engine but the car seems to have more pep. Gas mileage has improved. They improved the stereo system by using easier to find buttons and adding multiple FM presets. A trivial change that makes a big difference to me is the new placement of cup holders. Used to be they were blocked by the console gearshift. They are more useful now but are too small. 
We have had trouble with the security system when trying to set the alarm and rear doors take too many tries to unlock with the security system. We have had good service and the problems have been fixed (hopefully).  Sudden stops produce a pulsating sensation in the brake system, but this is an improvement from previous models in that the grinding sound has stopped. (I guess they are still working out the bugs on the braking system). This is a lease vehicle for us and we are still not sure if this was a good route to take. We feel that it may have been a better idea to finance to buy instead of lease because of the way Toyotas hold their value. We weren't sure we could afford the regular payment on conventional financing. Still think this is a pretty darn good car.<br><br>
