I am not a truck person, by any stretch of the imagination.  I prefer smaller cars (I have a 2000 Z3 and a 2001 330i) and always found trucks/SUVs too bulk and unresponsive to even consider going in that direction.  When my ex-girlfriend began looking for a replacement for her 99 Lexus RS300 after some service headaches, I promptly suggested we take a look at the new BMW X5.  Although I'd seen them on the dealer's lot, I'd never driven nor been in one - the service with my cars has been outstanding, so I figured the BMW was the logical choice for her.

We took delivery of a a new 2001 X5 3.0i that afternoon from the dealer's inventory, and I drove it the 40 miles back to her house.  In less than an hour, I was sold.  The X5 is nimble, relatively quick (the same engine as my 330i) and very comfortable to ride in.  At no point did I get the dreaded "I'm driving a truck" feeling - the X5 felt very close to my 330, just a couple feet taller.

Several times over the next couple of months I ended up with the X5 for trips ranging from 5 miles to over 100.  Driving it is a dream and its controls are all within reach.  Coming from the Z3/330, I liked the placement of the window controls on the doors (as opposed to the center panel) and found the Xenon headlamps to make a huge difference in nighttime driving.  The seats are comfortable for long drives, the suspension is very firm yet soft enough to make driving over rough NJ turnpikes relatively painless.   Handling in the rain was excellent (although I'd been told by my salesman that X5's equipped with the Sport Package lose some stability in inclement weather) and visibility was great.  

The rear seats are roomy, seating my 6'2" brother with no problems.  When hauling young kids around, the inclusion of built-in window shades for the rear doors was a definite plus.  Storage space, although adequate, wasn't quite what I'd expected in a vehicle of this size.  The brakes seemed to be a bit too touchy for me, requiring a VERY soft touch to avoid looking like a bad driver.  My only other complaint is the climate controls - the X5 has a dual-zone (passenger and driver) system that seems somewhat confusing to operate.  If it wasn't for some similarities between the X5's AC controls and the ones in my 330i, I would have been totally lost.

All things considered, having clocked several thousand miles behind the wheel of the X5, I'd seriously consider buying myself one as a possible replacement for the 330i when its lease is up.  Leasing the X5 is attractive because of its high residual value (although a 2001 X5 3.0i was about $5000 more than my 2001 330i, the lease payments were significantly cheaper).  Even with its higher price tag, it's worth the money when compared to other SUVs in its class, and definitely is on my list of vehicles to check out for myself when I start shopping again in 2003.

<b>Update : 4/25/01</b><br>
Patience is not one of my virtues.  While taking my 330i in for service (the CD changer was jammed), the dealership lent me a 2001 X5 4.4i for a couple of days.  Outstanding - the 4.4 was fairly well equipped, but the power - wow.  I'd been used to the 3.0 and found it "sporty" enough for most conditions, but the 4.4 made merging into highway traffic a breeze.  Although there's a roughly $9000 premium to get the V8, the price difference is really closer to around $4000 after taking into account the standard features on the 4.4 vs. the 3.0.  

An observation on the premium sound system for the X5 - it's a waste of money.  I love the H/K system in my 330i, but it was only a $675 option.  The $1200 upgrade cost for the X5 gave some cool DSP effects, but seemed ridiculously overpriced for the money.  The stock 10 speaker system in the X5 sounds superb - use the extra $1200 to tack on some other options (heated steering wheel, xenon lights and cargo tray, anyone?).  

After some debate and deliberation with my better half (oh she of 4 years barring a 6 month hiatus last spring), we decided to order a new X5.  The dealers seem to be more willing to discount the 4.4s - they offered twice the discount on the 4.4 that they were ready to go on the 3.0.
For some reason, the residual value on the 4.4, however is not as high as the 3.0 (56% vs. 61%, if I remember correctly) - another reason I began to veer away from it.  

Although the 4.4 powerplant was impressive, we did opt to go with the 3.0 after weighing gas prices, insurance costs and her lead foot.  I'm a firm believer in ordering a car when you cross the $30,000 barrier - if you're going to invest that much in a vehicle, I figure the extra wait is worth it to have EXACTLY what you want.
