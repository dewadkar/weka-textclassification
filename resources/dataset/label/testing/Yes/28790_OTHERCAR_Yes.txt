            I purchased my 1998 Lumina LTZ in December of 2001.  My previous car (see my review on the 1991 Lumina) was about ready to die so a different car was needed.  After my last experience with a Lumina I said I wouldn't own another one.  In looking at cars I didn't even look at another Lumina until I saw the LTZ with the 3.8V6.  A very dependable engine that GM has been making just about since the beginning of time.  I decided that this was a different enough car to at least take it out for a drive and give it a shot.  I'm very glad I did this because I've been very happy with this car.  

Interior:
The Lumina I have has the LTZ package which includes some nice features.  It has bucket seats in the front, with the floor shifter.  The book says they are sport buckets, but in reality they are not too sporty, but are very comfortable and do wrap around the front passengers slightly.  The interior is Leather in this Lumina which is nice, but living in a climate that can be very hot some times, and very cold others I would prefer the cloth seats.  The seats are not heated in this car.  I prefer this to the 60/40 split bench included with the base Lumina.  Also included is a power sunroof.  This is something I had never had before and will never be without from now on.  With the push of a button the sunroof lifts up and opens, very nice and easy.  It makes the car feel much more open and less closed in.  The only drawback is the sun can get into your eyes if it is at the correct angle.  There is a slider that can be slid over the sunroof to block the sun.  The gauges are set up nice, the speedometer is the largest gauge in the center, with the tachometer being nearly as large just off to the right of the speedometer.  The gas and temp gauge are much smaller and on the left side of the speedometer.  Inside the car also had power windows and locks.  The drivers window includes an express down feature that allows just one quick touch and the window rolls all the way down.  Not a necessary feature but is a nice touch.  In my opinion the nicest and a feature that will be needed on every vehicle for me from now on is the duel climate control.  Both the driver and front passenger can set the vents on their side to the temperature they prefer.  I'm always warm and my wife is always cold so this is a necessity for us.  It works suprisingly well and we are both comfortable in this car.  

Performance:
The LTZ has the 200hp 3.8V6 under the hood.  This has been a great engine.  It has nice power from the start, but lacks a little bit of passing power at higher speeds.  With the larger engine one would think that gas mileage would suffer, but the 3.8 is also known for great gas milage.  I usually average 27mpg with about an even combination of city and highway driving.  This is as good or better than many smaller cars get.  The LTZ also has performance suspension. This coupled with the 16" Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires it came with makes cloverleaves and sharp turns more fun than the base Lumina.  This car will never be confused for a BMW, or little sports car, but it serves its role as a sports sedan very well.  

Maintenance Issues:
When I purchased the car it had 36,000 miles, a lease return.  It had been on the lot for about 5 months, so had not been used for a while.  This lead to the only problem I've had with the car.  Shortly after purchasing it I noticed transmission fluid on the ground where I parked it.  I took it in and found out it was a bad transmission pan gasket.  The mechanic said it had dried out while it sat on the lot and this is more than likely what caused the problem.  The cost was $400 to fix, but that is it other than changing oil, and rotating the tires.  One thing I was afraid of in buying a used car with all the "bells and whistles" was that they would cause problems down the road.  So far so good, I have since put on another 39,000 miles (75,000 total on the car) and they all work as well as they did when I got it.  

Styling:
This car differs from the normal Lumina in a few subtle ways.  It has no grill on the front.  There is just an opening with the bowtie and looks like the Monte Carlo front end.  Also, the rear of the car is black, not the body color that other Lumina's have.  The last difference is the wheels are what Chevy called the sport wheels, basically a five spoke rim.  This is one car that looks innocent but has a little something under the hood.  

Complaints:
Unlike my 1991 Lumina this part is very short.  My biggest complaint is the back seat.  I'm 6' tall and when I sit back there my head just brushes against the celing of the car.  This is pretty common in the newer rounded cars.  Also, there is only one cup holder.  This has never been a problem for me, but my wife really thinks there should be more.  There really should be at least one for the front passenger.  My only other complaint is that the back seats do not fold down.  Whenever we have to haul something big, (ex. bikes, or skis etc) we have to take my wife's small Escort (see my review on 1995 Ford Escort) because her seats fold down.  Other than these small complaints I've been very happy with this car.
