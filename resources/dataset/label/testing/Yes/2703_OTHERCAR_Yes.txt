            I had bought a Ricoh about a year ago with a 400,000 pixel resolution and was ready for better quality. I shopped around for a couple months and had decided on the Kodak 790 because of it's reviews and resolution. It was $1000. I saw the AGFA on a couple of auction sites and saw I could get it for around $400. I researched it and got nothing but rave reviews. I bought one and have taken lots of pics with it and really love it. The pros are:
easy to use
great pic quality
smart media - i got 2 extra simple media 8 mb cards for $40 - they are very convenient

The only negative is the camera seems to go thru batteries rather quickly, so I bought a charger. I highly recommend this camera for the price.<br><br>
