            This has made some money for me on Ebay!!  It is excellent for Ebay.  it is so easy to use.  No extra buttons to push, very user friendly!!  I have had it for 5 months, it has certainly paid for itself by doing my auctions.  I also use it for around the house, my kids love it.  They really enjoy looking at themselves right after I take the picutre!  It also comes with the software to use it in your computer.  Very easy to upload, and very fast too.  Once the pictures are taken, it is simple to load in your camera, and then do your thing, either do an auction, or send e-mail pictures to your family...the ideas are endless!!This is a great family camera, it is not too expensive, although it is much more than the other cameras.  I recommend this to any one trying out their first camera.<br><br>
