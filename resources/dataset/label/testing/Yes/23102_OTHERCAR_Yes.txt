            I was looking for a digital camera for quite some time.  I wanted one that was easy to carry and care for, would fit compactly into my brief bag, and would be priced properly to make it worth my while to use and send digital images over the internet.  One day I entered my needed specifications into a website to search for that camera and only one resulted.  It was the PDC640 by Polaroid Corporation.  I found one and bought it.  

I have used this camera almost daily for approximately 5 months now.  I take, sometimes, up to 10 pix a day x 5 days a week.  With the program provided I can quickly download these pictures and send them on their way with my faxed report.  I am a Realtor and I use my camera for business.  It has not failed my and for the under $300 price it fit perfectly into my expense structure.  It beats developing a partial film, scanning to a disk, then e-mailing it.  I save a bunch.<br><br>
