            After scouring review over review on the Net, I decided on the 1.3 megapixel Powershot A50. I purchased the optional DK110 power supply/rechargeable NiMH battery kit as well. I strongly recommend getting the power supply/rechargeable battery kit since it'll pay for itself after a few uses. You'd otherwise be spending a lot of cash replacing the $$$$ 2CR5 photo battery that the camera uses.

This is my 2nd experience with a digital camera, the 1st being a Kodak DC50 back in 1997. I brought the A50 along for a trip down to San Diego and it took excellent pictures. The camera comes with an 8MB compactflash memory card, which allowed me to take 106 pics in the lowest image quality  mode (640x480), which was fine since i was posting the images on the web anyways. The images came out clear and had bright, clean, accurate color reproduction. Also, the cycle time to take a new shot was only a few seconds which was great when i needed to take a few quick shots in succession (the A50 also has a continuous 1-FPS mode if you need even faster consecutive shots). There is also a &quot;stitch-assist&quot; mode that helps you align shots that can later be stitched together into a panoramic image with the bundled software, which was a cinch to use. This, along with it being tripod-mountable, looks like it would serve as a decent setup to create QuicktimeVR movies.

The only major thing lacking was a USB port. The serial interface made for painfully slow downloads to my computer, although that was alleviated when I picked up a SanDisk USB Imagemate compactflash reader. Even without USB, the A50 is still a tremendous buy: top-quality construction, great picture quality, and a ton of features. Oh yeah, it even comes with connectors &amp; software for PCs and Macs, which is great since I work on both platforms.<br><br>
