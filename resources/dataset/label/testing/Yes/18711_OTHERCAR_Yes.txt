            I will keep this short and sweet.  The Lincoln LS is a truly fantastic first attempt from Lincoln to seriously go head to head with BMW and Benz.  While I agree with most regarding the LS's powerplants, the Getrag Manual transmission does make up for some of the V6's shortcomings.  All in all, this car should not be mated with any engine producing less than 250HP.  The 220HP from the V6 is simply not enough to move this 4,000lb car around with any swift.  Make no mistake, it's not slow by any means, but don't think you're going to be taking any and every car off the line.  My '92 Acura Legend with a 3.2L 200 HP V6 with manual transmission got around with slightly more agility than does my '02 LS.  Like I said, it's not SLOW, but by no means a rocket.

To the interior:  I love the interior of this car and I think it's nicely appointed, but tend to agree with the majority of critics regarding the LS's cheap materials.  NEVER use fake wood in a $40k car...you're not fooling anyone.  And I'm disappointed that the leather seats are not leather all the way around.  Seat backs, headrests, and sides or rear seats are all vinyl.  Again, Lincoln is not fooling anyone with the vinyl inserts. 

I think the instrument panel and center stack are very tastefully designed and very uncluttered allowing easy use of controls.  The only thing I don't like is the "grass" green lighting that Ford insists on using corporate wide.  I would like to see the LS take after the '03 Navigator and Aviator and use the white electroluminescent lighting scheme and leave the "grass" green for Kia.  Climate controls are fantastic and I really enjoy the heated windshield wipers and rain sensing system--very cool.  And my 12 speaker Alpine sound system rivals my wife's Harmon Kardon system in her XK8.

Fit and Finish:  Fit and finish are largely fantastic with 2 exceptions.  The deck lid is slightly mis-aligned above the tail lamp and is quit obvious to discerning customers.  The other has to do with paint matching.  My LS is the new Silver Birch (which is new for '02) and when the sunlight hits the side of the car directly, one can see that the body paint does not match the fascia's.  It's not blatantly obvious...you really have to stare at it, but it's there.  The body paint has a higher level of metallic than do the front and rear fascia's--they don't have the sparkle that the body does.

Well, I guess this didn't end up short and sweet.
