            I owned a 1992 Honda Accord for about 2 years before trading it in for a new 2002 Accord. Unfortunately, I have to say "they don't make 'em like the used to". But I won't go into the problems of my new accord during this review.

<b> The Good </b>

For a 4 door family car with 95,000 miles on it, the car had a good amount of power and never broke down. This car has a healthy amount of torque; that's to say the car will snap your neck back and really get up and <i> GO </i>, even on the freeway. I'm afraid I can't say that about the new accord. In the two years I owned the car I never had a problem, in fact I probably only spent about $100 for routine maintenance over 2 years. 

The interior is surprisingly roomy, but not at the expense of the trunk. Four people can comfortably sit in this car which can accommodate their luggage as well. The sunroof is an added bonus if your car is equipped as such. The seats are fairly comfortable and the view is unrestricted. 

<b> The Bad </b>

While some good things may be said about the interior, it still leaves much to be desired. The major problem I have had is the door panels continue to peel off in the summer heat. No matter how much glue I put on them the cheap cloth continues to peel. The shifter/cupholder/cigarette lighter situation is a real nightmare. Want to put a drink in the cupholder while the car's in park? Good luck! The shifter gets in the way - not leaving enough room for your drinks. Got a drink in the cupholder? Good luck getting to your cigarette lighter. Got a radar detector that requires the cigarette lighter? Guess you won't be having drinks in the car anytime soon. 

The cloth seats are made of very cheap material and are very easy to stain. Both of my headrests have become stained black - and yes, I wash my hair everyday! God forbid you ever spill a drink in the car, because it will never come out. Speaking of cheap materials, the clearcoat seems to be very easy to scratch off. I had several unsightly spots coming up when I traded the car. Also the doors ding very easily and the trunk will scratch if anything is placed on it. 

I only have two major complaints: (1) This car <i> heavily </i> bogs when you get 3 or 4 people in it. You will find yourself going to 4,000 rpm regularly during normal driving. Add luggage to the mix and you've got a real nightmare. (2) The A/C becomes almost ineffective during the summer. For some, this may not be a factor, but during Houston summers this is a major consideration. If you're going to be spending more then 5 minutes in traffic during the summer, get ready for the sweat to start pouring. The A/C is so ineffective that I usually drive with the windows down. It adds an air of youth and fun to the car, but is unacceptable when wearing business attire or attending formal occasions.
