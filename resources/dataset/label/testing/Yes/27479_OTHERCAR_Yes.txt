            After reading reviews about both the Canon Pro70 (Pro70) and the Nikon Coolpix 950 (950), then doing my own research for 2+ weeks, I decided to go with the Pro70 ... and very satisfied with my decision.

My decision tipped the scale towards the Pro70 for a few reasons:

1) Bulk with Flash: The Pro70 is definitely a bit bulkier than the 950, however, I found myself needing to use the flash for a lot of indoor pictures that I do. If I were to use an external flash for the 950, I would need a flash bracket. 

WINNER: TIE. Pro70 for flash photography, but Nikon was definitely more portable for non-flash photography.

2) Uncompressed image storage: The Pro70 uses stores an uncompressed image with a RAW CCD format. The Nikon stores it in TIFF. 

WINNER: Pro70 at about 2MBs uncompressed versus the 950 at about 4MBs. 

3) Storage capacity: The Pro70 takes 2 compact flash cards (Type I and Type II), versus the Nikon which can only take 1 compact flash card (Type I).

WINNER: Pro70 which can take the IBM microdrives at around 340MB in the type II slot, and another compact flash at around 128MB in the type I slot.

4) Lens quality: The Pro70 images showed no barrel distortion whereas the 950 showed very little. 

WINNER: Pro70

5) Lens Zoom: The Pro70 gives a  28-70mm zoom, but the 950 gives a 38-115mm zoom (35mm camera equivalents). Depending on your needs, a 28mm zoom is very nice for indoor shots, however the 115mm zoom on the 950 is nice for portraits.

WINNER: TIE. 

6) Macro capabilities: Not evaluated -- I don't shoot macro so this wasn't a factor in my decision. However, the 950 I hear can shoot better macro shots.

WINNER: N/A, but word on the street say that the 950 is great with macro.

7) Popularity: Why do you say is this important? I find it important because of the product to have the ability to resell itself in the market at close to the purchase price. Also, the more popular the product, the more people experiment with it -- ie: experimenting with different lenses, adding their own homegrown accessories and then selling it on the net. Also, if you search for digital pictures on the net, you'll find a lot more 950 pictures than Pro70. 

WINNER: Nikon 950.

8) Image quality: Despite some barrel distortion on the Nikon 950, the images on both cameras are both outstanding. I took a lot of pictures at work during a work event, and had great comments coming back from people including our web designers, and one of them owned a 950. They were asking me if I took the pictures with a digital camera -- they couldn't believe the quality. The diffused flash defintely helped in the quality. 

WINNER: TIE.

9) Battery life: The Pro70 claims to take 400+ shots on one battery charge, whereas the 950 takes 4 AAs. My cousin who owns a 950 says he can take about 40-80 shots with his NiMh batteries.

WINNER: Pro70

10) Ergonomics: The Pro70 feels like an SLR camera, whereas the 950 feels a little awkward. You have to hold the two cameras side by side yourself and see what feels most comfortable with you.

WINNER: Pro70

11) Resolution: Pro70 is a 1.6 Megapixel camera, vs the 950 which is a 2.1 Megapixel camera. However, if I compared my pictures to my cousin's 950 pictures, my pictures turned out a little sharper in low-light. The Pro70 has supposedly focuses better under low-light. Suprisingly, I favored the Pro70 pictures more under daylight .. they still seemed sharper for some reason.

WINNER: Based on raw numbers, the 950 would win this one, however I favored the Pro70 pictures.

12) Manual controls: The Pro70 has aperture priority, but no shutter speed priority (although shutter speed can be controlled indirectly via aperture priority). Boo! With the 950, one has full manual control, shutter, and aperture priority. Yay!

WINNER: 950.

13) Metering: The Pro70 has center-weighted metering wheras the Nikon has three: spot, matrix, and center. I figured though that this wouldn't be too much of a factor since I could see the exposure on the LCD screen and then compensate using exposure compensation. Still, the Nikon provides more options.

WINNER: 950

14) Price: I got the Pro70 for $600 on the net. Later I found the Pro70 selling at another site for about $540. The cheapest I've found the 950 was $600 ($500 with the Nikon rebate). The Nikon, however, did not come with rechargeable batteries which would bring the price of both cameras to about even.

WINNER: TIE.

Conclusion: There are definitely some aspects of the Pro70 that would be nice to have, but overall, I think that the Pro70 is a much better buy. The 950 comes at a very close second. Whichever one you choose though, I believe you'll be happy with your decision -- you can't lose with these high-quality digital cameras that sell for about $550.

OVERALL WINNER: Pro70<br><br>
