            I am the owner of a brand new 2000 Honda Civic Coupe EX, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  I bought a 1999 Civic in July '99, and unfortunately was involved in a tremendous accident with it about 3 weeks ago.  So, what next I thought.  I couldn't imagine buying a different car.  My car is the smoothest ride I've ever driven for a car in its class.  It is a 5-speed shift, and holds nothing back.  I would even recommend this car to someone who wants to learn how to drive a stick shift.  It is extremely smooth in switching gears, as well as easy to accommodate downshifting, etc.  This car has real pep, and although it won't beat out a Mustang in a race, it has a strong, fast engine.  But enough about performance.  Let's talk about its aesthetic beauty.  My friends keep telling me it looks like a BMW, and it does resemble the famous &quot;beamer&quot; look.  I chose the cool silver shade of paint, which really looks so amazing.  It's smooth but not flashy.  The EX version(mine) comes with Cd, moon roof, A.C., and the works.  The seats are really comfortable, with the driver seat having that lumbar adjustment setting feature to it.  I am about 5'2'', so being able to adjust the seat height and support is great for me.  I think my favorite thing about my new new car is just how comfortable it is all around.  Smooth exterior looks, comfortable interior, and excellent performance.  I love this car so much I'd buy it again if I had a third time around.  I'll just hope I can keep this one scratch-free!!!<br><br>
