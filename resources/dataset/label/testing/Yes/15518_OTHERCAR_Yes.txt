            I've had my Z for a little over 1200 miles now... and I could not really be happier with my purchase. This car not only looks amazing, and catches eyes (from people driving BMWs to Mercedes to Porches, etc), but it outperforms ALL of them. Take this car for a test drive, and you will know what I mean. I bought the Touring model with 5 speed auto w/ tiptronic shift option. I am pleasantly surprised with the tiptronic performance. I'm learning that using the tiptronic out of the gate is MUCH better for performance as you get to control the shift points. You don't even need to take your foot off the accelerator as the electronic throttle manages the shift for you.

<p>As far as handling goes, this car amazes me. It's very tight steering, and it holds turn at 90+ (all I've been able to test to!) with ease. Speedwise, this car will not only torch a Porsche Boxter out of the gate, but will beat it's top end speed too. Thanks to Nissan pumping out about 290hp out of the engine... I added a K&N Filtercharger to boos it a couple more, and that helps too. The value in this car is astonishing. Everyone who guesses what the car cost guesses around $60k or $70k. Amazing, since I paid half of that. Everything in the interior that looks aluminum IS ALUMINUM. Not a cheap knock-off. Just a few items that are aluminum: all the pedals are drilled aluminum, the door handles, the steering wheel plates, the kick plates, the strut bracer, the shift cirlce, and the passenger door handle.

<p>The feel of the car is very tight. The pedals have NO give, the brakes and gas pedal in the Touring are drilled aluminum, not rubber, so you feel it easily through your shoe. No mushy feeling whatsoever. All the pedals are smooth and responsive, I couldn't really demand more from pedals! I'm usually annoyed when gas pedals are too small. The Z's is adequate. It DOUBLES the size of my old Ford Explorer pedal, which I like a LOT.

<p>Soundwise, I am impressed. The Touring models come with an enhancement that further suppresses road noise from the outside. It, however, does not dim the sound of the healthy exhaust. I am fairly satisfied with Nissan's tuning of the exhaust system. It sounds very well tuned just as stock. It DOES NOT SOUND like those cheap "huge" mufflers that honda enthusiasts put on their 1.8 liter engine to make it sound tough and powerful. That is fake. The Z's is not. The exhaust pipes are nice and large... I find NO need to even think about any aftermarket pipes for this car. Granted, this will NOT sound like an American musclecar. You will not be able to FEEL this car from blocks away. But it does have a roar when you unleash it. Oh yeah, I and have recieved multiple compliments FROM people driving American musclecars about the sound and looks of the Z.

<p>As far as other value, you're getting a car with traction control, vehicle dynamic control, electronic brake distribution, brake assist, electronic braking and acceleration (no cables to snap), and LOADS of safety features. My car has SIX airbags. If I'm ever in a wreck, I will be in an air bubble. I heard one man who bought one of these was T-boned by a van going 50 in a high speed chase. The Z flipped down a hill 5 times and hit a tree and the man was fine... got out even! Guess the oval side impact bars did their job. There are LOADS of other safety features in this car... it's designed to break away like F1 cars around the cab, so that the body takes the impact, not you.

<p>Mileage is *close* to what they quote. I took a 500 mile trip from Chicago to Omaha in it (since Omaha had NONE available...) and I got about 25.8 miles per gallon. Truthful city driving I typcially get a little over 16, which is lower than I expected, but I drive a short distance with LOADS of stoplights, which is really bad for fuel economy. The highest I ever got on any trip was around 30 mpg on the highway.

<p>Prior to buying this car, I was concerned with comfort. I'm about 6'3" 215... very athletic build. I can fully extend my legs in both driver and passenger seats. I had a friend who is 6'6" 300lbs. also athletic sit in it, and he was fine as well. The seats are very welcoming to many body types, and the adjustability on the Touring model is very nice. The drivers seat has a leg "reverse submarine" in the middle, which is pretty cool looking and feels nice. The driver's seat also has a cutout on the shift-side hand which allows your upper arm free movement when shifting... and yes, it is nice, because without it, shifting would be much more cumbersome.

<p>The people who are quick to complain about things in this car forget that you get WAY more than you pay for in this car. It is not a $100,000 car. You can't have it all... sacrifices DO have to be made. I really don't care if I have a "limited rear view" because I passed EVERYONE. And I can adjust to "not enough cargo space." If I wanted an SUV, I would have bought another one of those. And the "understeers" comments I've heard... well, part of that might be the driver. Most cars either understeer or oversteer. Braking while turning helps. Try it, the brakes on this baby do well. Lastly, the sound system. I admit it is brutal... not because of Nissan, because of Bose. They attached nice speakers to an "acceptable" CD player. Bose is not known for having excellent mid range, and I'm not really surprised this is not something you can adjust on the player itself... but you know what, I really don't care... I'm not in this car to fake like I'm at a concert. I'm in this car to drive because it's FUN.
