            At $29,000, the I30 offers solid value, strong performance and just the right touches of luxury. How do I know? Hey folks, I bought one.

With leather seats, shiny wood trim and a top-quality showroom experience, the I30 easily convinced me that it was a much different car than the Nissan Maxima it's based upon.

The Y2K I30 got a new exterior that's conservative and stylish. On the inside, the car mixes a smart interior with great ergonomics. 

Under the hood, the car got a nice boost. Its 3.0-liter V-6 now makes 227 horsepower. This horsepower translates into plenty of available power and handling is quite good. These refinements also make for a quieter motor. 

The already mentioned wood trim and leather seats are standard. Add to that standard package a 200-watt Bose stereo system that features both a cassette and a CD player. Over the base I30, the I30 gets 17-inch tires and alloy wheels, Xenon headlights, a sunroof, a motorized rear sunshade and other features. 

The I30 LE that I purchased was priced at just over $33,000, though I paid closer to $29,000. But even $31,000-33,000 makes it a better buy than a BMW 328i or a Mercedes-Benz C280.

I know, I know! Infiniti doesn't share the reputation of its European competitors. I don't disagree. Some would say that the I30 isn't as sporty as the 328i, nor as classy as the C280. Again, I wouldn't disagree with that. But for buyers looking for a six-cylinder luxury car that's a pleasure to drive, a car that seats four comfortably and a car that offers the winning combination of good looks and fair price, the I30 is the vehicle for you.

Standard features: Four-wheel anti-lock brakes; 17-inch aluminum spoke wheels; power remote-controlled side-view mirrors; Xenon headlights with automatic on/off; fog and cornering lights; leather seats; wood trim; power driver's and front passenger's seats; 200-watt Bose Am/FM/cassette/CD stereo system; cruise control; automatic temperature control; split, folding rear seat; dual front and side air bags; keyless entry. 

EPA figures: 20 mpg (city), 28 mpg (highway)
