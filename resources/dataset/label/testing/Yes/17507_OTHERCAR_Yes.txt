            My wife and I are car enthusiasts, and we like have fun with non-competitive auto-cross and other events.  She is barely 5 foot - and I am over 225 lbs.  Why the personal info?  Because it is hard to find one car that is of the highest quality, competitive with the world's best performing sports cars - yet can comfortably fit two very different driving positions.  We have the mannually adjustable sport seats, which were best suited for our very different seating positions.  The Sports Seat were superior to the stock power seats for my "vertically challenged" wife - as this enabled her to have excellent vision and comfortable position with the wheel, clutch, brake, gas, etc....
The 911 Carrerra has many outstanding attributes, but the handling and braking are simply perfect.  The full leather interior with aluminum accents (door sills, shifter, brake handle, and gauges) make for an unbelievable quality and class feel - for a performance sports car.  The xenon headlights are superb and illuminate dark rainy nights as if it were day time.
Our favorite two options are the sport wing and sport exhaust.  The sport wing really makes the car look sharp.  The sport exhaust has a button on the dashboard for "normal" or "performance" sound.  Although the button is a lot of fun - we keep ours on performance all the time.
We have the 18" Carrera sport wheels which are really sharp, but do require additional time to clean as you can visually see all the way through the wheel.
The engine is very smooth and powerful.  The car is so smooth and well behaived that it does not seem to be as powerful as it is.  (Note: We also own a Corvette - which "feels" much more powerful - but when my wife and I "play" against one another - you suddenly realize that the 911's handling simply does not make you feel like you are going as fast as you actually are.)  Still, I would like more base horsepower/acceleration for the premium price.  
One other feature is the four passenger seating.  Clearly it is not reasonable to expect passengers to sit for any length of time in the back seats, but we have used ours more times than we expected.
Areas of improvement would be the radio (we have the middle option - not the highend Bose) - which is difficult to use, and candidly is inferior to standard stereo systems in comparably priced sport cars.  The telescoping wheel helps, but we would also prefer a tilt function.
Bottomline - the 911 Carrera makes two ametuer drivers very competitive on autocross, is very comfortable with plenty of room on long-weekend get aways, provides first rate interior, and is not seen on every street corner.  We love it.
