            I recently purchased a 2002 Suzuki Grand Vitara Limited model in Novemeber 02.  I was a returning Suzuki customer after having a 1995 4 Door Sidekick.  Coincidentally, I still own the 95 Sidekick, and plan to keep it for many years to come.   The 2002 Grand Vitara is completely different in everyway from its predessesor, the Sidekick.  Quite, smooth, carlike handling are some attributes that I had not been aquanted to.  The Vitara feels very solid, the doors are much thicker, as is the firewall that controls the noise that the engine/road create is wonderful.  I actually opened the door several times to make sure the engine was running. 
The controls are well layed out, and easily accessible.  The steering wheels is very comfortable, and requires little correction to keep the Vitara pointed where you want it.  The limited model offers leather seating, that is very comfortable, as well as stylish.   

For those who like to venture off the beaten path, like myself, you'll be happy to know that the Suzuki line of SUV's are actually built with Offroading in mind. Unlike the car-based SUV's, which are built on unibody chassis platforms which are perfect for road use,  the Suzukis use ladder box body on frame that allow the trucks to articulate over uneven terrain.  The Suzukis also have Part-time 4wd systems that are to be used only offroad or in low traction conditions. The Suzukis also offer a low range in the transfer case, which is an added bonus especially on tight/tricky trails. Both of these systems, are favored offroad over "Full-time" or "On Demand" 4wd systems that don't fully Lock both front and rear differentials together at a 50/50 torque split. I'm glad that Suzuki has retained their offroading herritage by maintaining the Frame, and low range attributes.  

Many comparisons are made with the Grand Vitara/Chevy Trackers and their competition the LandRover Freelander, Honda CRV, Toyota Rav4, Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute (both the same truck).  Personally, these vehicles don't fit into the same catagory. All of these vehicles (with the Freelander being the exception) are all unibody/on-demand SUV's (Loosly put) that don't offer the same capabilities that the Suzuki does.  
If your looking for an Offroad capable SUV, get the Suzuki. If you want a grocery getter that will give you more traction when it rains, pick one of the others.   

Suzuki's are a very underated vehicle manufacturer that deserve some attention.  Give them a look!
