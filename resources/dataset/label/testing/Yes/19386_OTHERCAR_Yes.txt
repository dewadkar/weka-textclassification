             I just leased a 2001 fully loaded W. B edition Venture. My last lease was also a Venture. I guess you could say i like them. This new one was a little more pricey than some others, but this one does have 8 seats, which is great with 4 kids  and their friends. Yes, the T.V is a added incentive when looking at minivans.  I didn't take shopping for a vehicle lightly. I actually drove everyone crazy I think for 2 months.
  I looked at the Odessey, Quest, Sienna and Montana before choosing, I did research on the Internet and Test Drove them all, except for the Montana.  I looked at the  spacing, length and width. The Quest was short in height( banged my head and I'm short) on the frame, drove nice, stereo was great, also comes with the video entertainment system. The other vans were also nicely equipped, the same as the Quest. The key factor for me was space, the double baby stroller had to fit in the back easily, since I take it every where with me. It didn't fit to well in the Quest, or the Seinna. The Seinna did drive like a dream though.
     Anyway, it is very difficult to choose the van that is right for your family. The Venture has the 8 seats that can be changed when needed, the middle 3 can come out individually, the last row of seats can be folded flat to have a storage area that is a nice size. The seats are halfcloth and half leather to give it a classy feel, the interior is a medium gray color, easy to hide the dirt from the children, does have a intergrated child seat, which is nice if you take along another small child with you. I have 2 children in car seats and even with their bulkiness, i feel I have enough space for others to get into the back, unlike some vans that have 7 seats, but the middle 2 are captains chairs and you have to squeeze in between them.
   In the back cargo area, there is a pull up door that has 3 seperate areas for storing things like, towels for the beach, maps and atlas, etc. 
   The entertainment system is great for traveling, or around the town, mine came with 4 wireless headphones, that can allow the person to listen to T.v. or the radio, batteries were included. Also it comes with a remote for the people to use if they want to rewind it or stop it, leaves the driver free to watch the road.
    The options it came with are great, rear power sliding door controlled by the driver or passenger as well as on the keyless entry remote. It came with a security system as well, added benefit for insurance as well as safety. The parking aid is a new feature that comes on automatically or you can disable it, this helps when backing up and chimes if there is something in the way. The rear windows also can be opened as well form this console of choices that are mounted in the ceiling for the driver or passenger(front).
     Overall, I do truly love the ventures, I have been driving them since 1998, this one is better than the last one, just ask the kids!!! I also have recieved free gifts from Chevy, movies and a tote bag, also 2 travel etch-n-sketchs!!!
