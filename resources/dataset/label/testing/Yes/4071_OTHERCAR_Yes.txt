            We love our 1998 Chevy Venture. It's great when you need to seat 7 or remove the seats for more storage room.

When we got out for lunch at work, I'm the designated drive when there's more than 2 of us. As passengers they all love it.

My wife loves the many convenient cup holders. And there's no stupid cup holder UNDER the radio which is useless like many vehicles.

The CD player is separate and near the floor which makes it impossible for the driver to safely change CD's. We only use the CD when traveling so it's not really a problem.

Conversions are easy but the seats are awful heavy and awkward. I don't know how they compare to other minivans.

Visibility is excellent probably because of the large windows, esp front. But I always have trouble keeping them from fogging up as I have to run the defrost more than usual.
