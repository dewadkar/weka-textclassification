            The driver's side mirror is held on with black electrical tape.  This summer our radiator had been glued together so water would stop leaking out of it.  When you accelerate the entire car jerks back.  Sometimes you can't turn the car off until you turn the ignition and move it in and out of park a few times.

But, the car is almost 11 years old.  The motor oil has been changed twice that we know of, and both of those times were AFTER we bought the car in February 2000.  The tires have been changed once, also only since we've come to own this car.  But I gotta say, this car has broken down less than the 1998 Dodge Neon we had before it.  (A review will follow about the beloved Neon, may it rest in peace)

This is really my first car.  My husband had the 98 Neon before I met him, so it was always &quot;his&quot; car.  I don't even have my license yet.  But this is the car that I will take the driver's test in.  

I never knew what people found so special about their first cars...now I do.  The way your butt fits in the seat just right.  The way the McDonalds wrappers seem so at home in back of the passenger seat.  The way the wind runs through your hair even in winter, becasue your power windows stopped working in the process of the windows being rolled up.

I find something about this car endearing.  Maybe I feel sorry for it, kind of like that really ugly stray kitten that you find outside your house, but refuse to take to the shelter because it's so ugly that no one would adopt it.  

But, the car is not all bad.  It can go fast once you get over the initial acceleration, which jerks so hard you're afraid you'll hit that nice Cadillac that's right behind you.  (bad motor mounts...I really should get that fixed)  It is a reliable car, except that time, right after my friend's wedding when the engine started smoking...still don't know what that was all about.

Would I ever recommend this car to others?  Ha!  I doubt there's any other's still running to recommend...but yes, all in all, this car has performed very well despite years of neglect.
