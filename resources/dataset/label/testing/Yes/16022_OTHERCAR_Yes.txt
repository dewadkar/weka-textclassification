            After our 1978 Honda Accord hatchback starting giving us problems, we went out looking for new cars.  The car was for my mom, and it was her choice, but she narrowed it down to either the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, or Geo Prizm.  The Prizm was too small, and the Accord's seats were too uncomfortable for her, so she decided on the Camry.  I took my driving test using this car, and drove it until I could figure out how to drive a 5 speed.  I've driven this particular Camry about 8-10K miles. Here is what I have to say about it:

<b>Performance</b>

The 1993 Camry either has a 2.2 liter I4 or a V6 engine.  Ours has a 130 horsepower I4 with automatic transmission.  The engine is VERY quiet when the car is running and never sounds harse even at higher RPM's.  I was able to attain a 10.2 second 0-60 mph time with this car, not bad at all. The car handles very securely, but does lean somewhat in turns.  The power steering works too good sometimes, which to me is annoying. The brakes work great. It's 60-0 time is done in a respectable 152 feet, and considering this car has rear drum brakes, that isn't bad.

<b>Available Features</b>

Since this is a mid-sized car, it does have quite a few available features.  These are included in packages, either the base, LE, or XLE.  There are some dealer installed options as well. Here is the list:

-Power Windows
-Power locks
-Power mirrors
-power steering
-remote trunk release
-driver air bag
-adjustable driver seat (height/width)
-intermittent windshield wipers
-I4 or V6 engine
-Air conditioning
-leather seats
-AM/FM cassette deck or CD player
-power antenna
-tachometer
-5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission
-2 or 4 door, either station wagon or sedan
-ABS


<b>Comfort/Ride</b>

This is a really roomy car.  Even the back seats are roomy enough for my 6 foot 2 inch self.  The front seats give you good lower back support, and seem to work fine. The rear bench seat is okay, but isn't really contoured to a good seating position.  It does have an arm rest though.  The Air conditioner is the COLDEST i've ever had the pleasure of using.  It will freeze you even if it is on the lowest blower setting, unless you turn the temperature dial up a little.  The ride is great. The car has soft springs which dampen any irregularities from the road surface.  The interior never really gets noisy.  Even on grooved pavement, you can barely hear anything inside the car, besides the A/C blower. 

<b>Recommendation</b>


If you are looking for a REALLY good family car, then get a Camry!! Used ones a relatively inexpensive, i've seen some 92-96 generations going for around $7000 or so.  These cars will last you at least another 10 years, if not more, and have no history of problems.  They are also pretty economical.  We see around 24 miles per gallon in pure city driving, but generally get 27 overall.  On some road trips, this car has gotten over 30 mpg, and with the big gas tank, the cruising range is over 450 miles!  <br><br>
