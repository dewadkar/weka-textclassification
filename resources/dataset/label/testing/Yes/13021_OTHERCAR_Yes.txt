            The Volvo S80 has to be one of their best cars yet!  An excellently priced luxury car.  Adults and teenagers will love driving this dream.

The car turns on a dime and the steering is excellent. The brakes are very tight so you could stop on that same dime.  The acceleration of this vehicle is incredible.  It's the closest thing to a sports car without the sports car!  The ride is smooth and quiet.  If you like smooth rides and you are tired of clunky luxury cars and you don't want the expense of a BMW or Mercedes then this car hits the spot. 

The seats in the car are made to live in.  I have not felt that comfortable in a car seat ever.  The back seat has ample leg room, even when the front seat is moved back some.

The sound system in this car impressed me.  Equipped with two 8" woofers, the bass in the S80 will rival anyone's system. The sound quality is excellent as well. 

The car handles long road trips excellently. It is also a good car for traffic driving.  Though it is full sized it can still weave in and out pretty well.  

The electronics on the dash are a nice feature.  Especially the gas feature which tells how many more miles of gas are left.
