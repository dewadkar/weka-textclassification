            I have a 1991 Ford Explorer and I know that most of you are looking for new cars but if you are looking for a used car I thought that you might want to check this out.  I like this car a lot.  It is very versatile and you can do many things with it.  First off, the cargo area is massive.  It has got to be the largest one in that class.  I can fit everything I own back there plus a pair of twelve inch subwoofers.  I have found that this car is easy to modify and add things to.  It takes everything without a problem.  Now I have had a few problems with it but not too many.  The transmission got some water in it because I was mud-riding in a two wheel drive car but it just drained out and worked fine.  This car has pretty good pickup and good gas mileage too.  I would recommend this car as a good choice, it's comfortable and easy to drive.  Oh yeah and the factory speakers in it sound real good too.<br><br>
