            I recently purchased this car.  I test drove it about 150 miles before deciding to buy it. The check engine light came on and scared me, but the mechanic fixed it, and now it seems okay to drive.  Someone else mentioned to me that the transmissions go out on this car, but mine is working fine, so I'm not worried about that either.  The back passenger side window is loose, but that is currently getting fixed. I hope the air conditioning lasts because it is going to be a hot summer!  It is a dependable car to go on trips with.  The back seat is fairly comfortable for people riding in your car.  It rides very smooth.  I'm a high school student and I needed a car to get to a University for 3 years, 8 hours away from me.  Hopefully, it'll work!  I will update this page with things that go wrong, as they go wrong.
