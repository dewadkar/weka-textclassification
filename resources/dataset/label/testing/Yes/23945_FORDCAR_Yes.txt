             My husband and I bought our Festiva used for about $1000. It's a 5 speed and gets great gas mileage, about 35-37. It's no luxury vehicle for sure. But it is dependable. Driving 30 miles to work everyday, ours has almost 90,000 miles on it. The only thing we've replaced is the muffler. This car has never left us stranded. We can replace the tires for around $25 a piece.

For such a small car it has a lot of head room, even in the back seat. Some hatchbacks, like the Geo, prevent adults from sitting in the back. Actually there is quiet a bit of leg room in the front.

My biggest complaint would be the windshield wipers. When your on the highway, the driver side wiper slips off the windshield. So far we haven't found anyone that can fix this problem. Another downfall would be at 60 it tends to shake a little. It's not for interstate driving.
