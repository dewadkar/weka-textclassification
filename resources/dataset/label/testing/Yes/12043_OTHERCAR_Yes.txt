            I acquired an S2000 on Oct 30th, 1999.  I had searched for the car from a large number of Honda dealers on the net for nearly two months.  I finally got a call from a dealer on a Wednesday, drove the vehicle the same day and leased it on the following Saturday.

I love the car; it's everything it's advertised to be, plus the expected quality of a Honda. Performance is outstanding; the car is a blast to drive.  It is a practical daily driver and so much fun to drive.  I am very satisfied with this car and plan to purchase it when my lease expires.<br><br>
