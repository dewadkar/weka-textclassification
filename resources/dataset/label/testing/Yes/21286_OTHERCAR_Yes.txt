                 I bought the Toyota Camry because I needed a safe, but also somewhat sporty car to drive. I looked at other cars the the Camry competes with, such as the Dodge Neon, Mazda 626, and Nissan Sentra and found that the Camry was the best deal for my money. The car that I bought was used, and the Camry had stayed in much better than condition than the other cars that I looked at. It had virtually nothing wrong with it, except for a few minor touch up problems when I had it professionally checked before buying it. I purchased the car in 1997 and the car was manufactured in 1992.
     I love that the car is so sensible and practical, but at the same time maintains a &quot;young&quot; flashy look. It is by no means a sports car, nor does it preform like one, but it does not at all look like a bigger vehicle that a young person should not be driving. I love how safe the car feels, my one complaint is that it seems like when one thing goes wrong with the car, everything starts to have problems.the thing that I like most is that is has one of the smoothest drives of any car that I have ever been in. It is very easy to drive, and very enjoyable to. I reccommend this car to someone looking for a safe, but also sporty car. It is by no means flashy, but it is very nicely styled and overall, a nice car to drive, no matter what your age is.
