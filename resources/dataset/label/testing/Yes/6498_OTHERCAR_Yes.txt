            I just received my DX3600, my first digital. I am a complete novice with digital, not much better with my regular point and shoot camera. I bought it based on reviews here and on CNET. I wanted something SIMPLE to use that takes nice pictures and is moderately priced. Within an hour I had installed the software and was taking pictures, editing them and emailing them. That is my definition of simple!

This camera can take close-ups or wide angle shots and the flash works very well. The docking station is a must have since it contains the charger, and more importantly, transfers the pictures to your PC with one touch of a button. It automatically brings up the Kodak software and transfers the pictures to your screen for viewing, editing, saving or trashing. Want to email your pictures, just type in the email address and a short note and one click to send. That's it! You can also create slide shows and view them on your TV.

The pictures have good color and contrast and you can print them on plain paper in a standard color printer. You can adjust the size for 3x5, 4x6 etc. and print one picture per page or several.

The camera also is capable of taking short videos with sound. Haven't tried that yet but it appears to be accomplished with the same ease as taking a picture. 

I paid $289 for the camera, including the docking station at buy.com. The price included shipping. I ordered a bag, various extra lenses, lense adapter, 64MB card and small tripod for taking close ups directly from Kodak for about another $100 directly. An entire package for under $400. I bought a digital camera as a gift about 4 years ago. It paid about $800 at the time and this is twice the camera for half the price and it is easier to use. That's progress!

Update: I have had this camera for awhile now and must say that my initial impressions have been confirmed. The docking station is absolutely wonderful to use. Just pop the camera in, push a button, and about a minute later all your pictures are on your on your computer screen! Emailing is a breeze and you don't even have to bring up your email account. I find myself taking pictures I would never have dreamed of taking with a film camera due to the cost of film and developing. You can practice, practice, practice taking good pictures.
