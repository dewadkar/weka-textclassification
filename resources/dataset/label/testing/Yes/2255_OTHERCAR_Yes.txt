            Well, we have a Lexus LS400, and it has been a good car, but...........
1)The front seat cup holder/pop out thing-a-ma-jig broke within the first month that we had the car.  
2) The air conditioner provides only a whiff of air.  At best it can be described as a slight breeze. This is a problem on hot Texas summer afternoons!
3) The little hook that you can hang clothes on in the backseat is long gone.
4) The window tint that the dealership had put on for us is bubbling.  I realize this is not a &quot;Lexus&quot; problem, however it was provided by the dealership.  

Now, having said that.......
1) This is hands down the best &quot;driving&quot; car either of us has ever driven.  It handles like a dream.  I must watch my speed on the highway because within seconds I will be traveling way over the speedlimit without knowing it.  The ride is completely smooth, and acceleration is a dream.
2) The car is admittedly gorgeous to look at.  We have black with a gold trim package.
3) The seats can be adjusted to anyone's comfort.  It goes up, down, and every which way.
4) There is a convenient control on the drivers side that allows two different seat settings.  I simply get in and push one of the two setting buttons, and the seat and steering wheele return to exactly the settings that are comfortable for me.  This is a great feature when 2 people drive the same car often.  It is so difficult to get everything set back just the way you like it!  

Overall, the car is a joy to drive and very comfortable to ride in.  My husband says he will never drive anything else.  I on the other hand would prefer more air power and more sturdy interior gadgets.  If performance is for you, then this car is too!
