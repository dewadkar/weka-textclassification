            Kudos to Fujifilm on the S602.

After moving away from the film SLR camera, I cannot be more impressed with digital photography and the S602.  My wife and I were very tired of having to get film developed and often getting mediocre results (perhaps because I'm not the best photographer?  :)), so we purchased the S602 and a Canon i850 (different review).

The results are absolutely stunning.  The Fuji optics combine for razor-sharp images with excellent colors and contrast (which you can always tweak).  The camera has an excellent selection of ISO settings, white-balance, flash types, shooting modes, etc.  I cannot see a difference between the 6MP and 3MP picture qualities, so for storage reasons, I always use the 3MP mode.  One feature that I absolutely love is the 5-shot, continuous shooting mode - a must for capturing fast-action, or that perfect smile.

The camera is power-hungry, so invest in some NiMH (1800+ mAH) batteries.  I have two sets of Energizer 1850 mAH, so I always have a backup set charged.  They last a long time, plus I almost always use the LCD, not the EVF.  I don't like the fact that the EVF doesn't capture 100% of the actual image taken.

My only real gripe with this camera is it's ability (or lack thereof) to focus in low-light conditions.  Often time, I have to switch the camera to manual focus, which results in sharp pictures, but I've lost some key moments having to go manual.  Sometimes, it's a real pain.
