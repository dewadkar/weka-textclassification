            <b>Picture quality: 8/10 </b>
I was impressed with the quality of the pictures that this camera took. It should be VERY high quality for the price, and it is!  It works fairly well in all Lighting conditions, if used properly.

<b>Battery Life: 9.5/10 </b>
I was impressed with the battery life on this one, I'm still using the same batteries that I got when I got the camera a while ago... I'm not sure how much longer they'll last, but they've already exceeded my expectations. 

<b>Price: 8/10 </b>
I only paid $2995 for it, That is a big investment.  More than my TV, DVD player, and Stereo and pet duck-billed Platypus all together... and a Platypus is NOT cheap!

<b>Ease of Use: 8/10 </b>
This is definitly not for beginners, if your not experienced in taking pictures then buy one of those $200 digital cameras, but if you're serious about photography and have some experience, then you can probably figure out most of the idiosyncrasies of this camera.

<b>Overall: 9/10 </b>
Overall it is a great camera.  Expensive, but not relative to other comparable products.  The bottom line is it takes great pictures and that is something I'm willing to pay for.
