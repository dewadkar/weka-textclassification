            The Hyundai Car Company, before 1995, didn't have the best reputation.  The car body was susceptible to premature rust and rot and the motor had a reputation of burning oil if it didn't receive constant TLC.

Well, the Hyundai Car Company has definitely done some homework in improving their product, and their warranties on the body and engine prove this.

I bought one of the first Accents made in 1995 even though I was a bit leary of the &quot;not so good reputation&quot;.  I trusted the reviews of Car and Driver Magazine and other reputable automobile magazines, including on-line information.  The price is what first attracted me to the car.  I don't have perfect credit, and was trying to get it back on track so I wanted a payment I could afford.  When I went to test drive some models I couldn't believe the value of the Accent.  It is a nice &quot;little&quot; car for the money.

I got a basic model, barely any extras, and it was from dealer stock.  I did do some looking around and, in 1995, you could get an Accent loaded for under 13,500.  Not bad.  The interior of my Accent was very attractive and comfortable.  Everything was in reach of the driver's seat.  The back seat was even roomy, which you would not expect given the size of the car. All in all the Accent is a great value!

It is now 1999 and I have only had to replace the regular wear and tear parts and a couple of other minor parts that fell under the warranty.  My Accent is now paid off and is still running great. I'll bet I could get another 4 to 5 years out of it, but I probably will buy a Hyundai Sonata in a year or two.

Also, the warranties of 1999 and newer cars are double that of 1995-1998, it is now 60,000 miles/5 years standard warranty, an unmatched warranty by even some of the best car companies today.

The only things I did not like about the Accent are the interior noise was a little louder than I like and the first 2 to 3 months the ride was stiff and took bumps like a Camaro.  It seemed to loosen up after a while.<br><br>
