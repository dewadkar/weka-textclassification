            My 4-Runner is an automatic 2WD.  It was bought used in 1996 with 28,000 miles on it.  When I got it, there were some minor cosmetic flaws (I attribute those to the previous owner), but the price was right.  A lot of the SUVs that I test-drove at the time rode like most trucks; kinda rough, not too smooth.  The 4-Runner had the best ride of them all, plus it was a nice change to have an elevated view.

Features wise, my car is top-notch:  cruise, AC, moon-roof, overdrive, 
ECT/Power switch (turbo boost), great sounding CD/cass/radio, power windows &amp; locks, anti-lock brakes.  I'm an audio/recording engineer, and the stock audio system really sounds pretty darn good, actually one of the better sound systems I've heard in a car.  I also haul around a fair amount of music/recording gear, and have no problems loading up stuff with the easy-access tailgate.  No spare tire to get in the way either, it's mounted underneath.  The seats (cloth) are comfortable enough, but the back seat is probably not good for the basketball team.  Maintenence is practically nil, just oil and filter changes, tire rotations, the usual little stuff.  Very reliable and practically bullet-proof overall.  Toyota make quality cars.

If I could change one major thing about it, it would be the engine.  The V6 seems a little under-powered to me.  Also, SUVs in general are over-priced, even used.  Gas milage is fairly respectable.  

But alas, my 4-Runner now has 72,000 miles on it and it is starting to show it's age:  the AC compressor, though still running good, varies between quiet and cranky sounding when I've got it cranked.  The CD player skips badly every now and then, either from the summer heat or me needing to replace the tires/shocks.  There's also this grinding sound eminating from behind the dash that sounds like an AC fan or speedometer part with a bad bearing.  As for the engine and everything else, I don't have any problems, it still runs *great*, although it's starting to loose that new car 'tightness'.....   

I think that my next car will be something more unique, I'm real bored with today's car designs, plus everybody and their grandmother seems to tool around in an SUV now.  I don't discredit the 4-Runner, though, I like mine just fine, and if you can find one reasonably priced, they're good, quality SUVs.


UPDATE 12-1-2000:
After replacing a bum radiator, alternator and battery at 73,000+ miles
(costing about $1000.00 total), I ain't too into my 4runner lately.  But with the new battery/alternator, it drives pretty peppy now, almost making me forget the 'underpowered' problem.  Interior rattles/noises have increased a lot too (I could use a new set of tires)....so all in all I've gotten a good solid 45,000+ miles out of it.  I will probably not buy a second hand car/SUV again, because I suspect that the radiator was fairly messed up in the first place.  I'm looking at Acura's new SUV, the MDX, but it's kinda pricey....the only other decent, affordable SUVs out there are smaller (Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute, CRV, etc), so my next car will probably be the Acura, or if the 4runner holds together I will patiently wait for Saturn's new SUV to roll out next year.<br><br>
