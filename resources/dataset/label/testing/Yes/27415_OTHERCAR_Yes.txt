            In 1994 after 2 months of researching all the smaller vehicles on the market, I took the plunge and bought my first brand new car: the 1995 Dodge Neon. I have never regretted it! I love this car!  I liked the the combination of reasonable price and gas mileage(33-40 mpg). Cute and comfortable. My Neon has over 76,000 miles on it.
Room: Though classified as a sub-compact, it is very roomy compared to the old Datsun I had before. You wouldn't believe how much stuff you can put in this car. Flip down back seats help with longer items.
Engine: horsepower to spare. This little car has the get up and go to rival my old Ford PU with a 302 engine. Definitely outperforms my husband's 95 Ford Ranger. No major repairs in 5 yrs (and it's paid for).
Performance on the road: Great! Tight cornering and handles wonderfully.
Problems: Had some problems with paint peeling 4 years out, but dealer did the work under warranty (even though mine was over).
On going problem with some sort of power drain on battery that I believe is related to the radio. Dealer disagreed, but 2 yrs with the fused removed from radio has proven me correct.
Overall: Great car at a reasonable price. My next car will be another Neon. VERY reliable!<br><br>
