            I own an Excursion 4X4, Estate Green, after trying the Explorer and finally the Expedition.  I must say this vehicle rules.  It is wonderful and spacious for the family, dogs, boat, and/or jet skies.  My vehicle has the V8, not the standard V10 on 4X4's, gas mileage is approximately 12.7 to 13.0 depending on city or highway driving.  My wife can handle this vehicle and actually has come to love it.  She drives a Volvo S-80 when not trucking in the Excursion.  I must say I love it and would recommend it to someone that enjoys space and many option to haul, carry passengers, tow, or just the comfort it offers.  I agree with the critics, gas mileage is not great, but you do not buy an Excursion for gas mileage...you buy it for other reasons.  As far as the economy, it meets EPA standards and is made of much recyclable material...I forget what the owner manual states and a few editorials I have read.  Therefore, it is in-line with the environment.  I enjoy it and have started to see them on the road, actually six to date, I have owned mine since Oct 99.  Test drive one and you will enjoy the height and comfort the Excursion offers.  However, highly recommend you are at least a qualified driver of a Suburban, Yukon, Semi-Tractor, or Expedition before getting behind the wheel.  It requires some large SUV experience before taking off on city streets.  If you are in the country...go for it....you have my approval.<br>Ken, Major US Army<br><br><br>
