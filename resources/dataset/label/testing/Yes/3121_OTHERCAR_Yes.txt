            I purchased the Hyundai Elantra Wagon in July 2000 and am fairly pleased with it.  The pick-up though leaves a lot to be desired.  Though I had hoped to have more space to carry larger loads, the back seats fold down but there is a bar across that is immovable and makes hauling somewhat challenging.  The car was into the shop within a month because it would stall with quick stops.  They have since been recalled for this problem.  I have a Toddler so the 4 doors and extra storage space are a plus.  I would not suggest this car to anyone who is used to fast pick-up.  It is slow to get going.  It is also somewhat noisy.  I do like its size and overall would suggest it for anyone who wants a little more space and a good value as it is reasonably priced.  The 10 year warranty is also a big plus.  <br><br>
