            I am a fairly recent convert to the Tao of Saturn. Always impressed by their tagline, "A Different Kind of Company. A Different Kind of Car," I decided to check out a local branch of the dealership, after my first car, a 1987 Honda Accord, started coughing and wheezing herself into decrepitude. 

As a college student, my part-time job mostly goes towards loans and books, and I didn't have that much to spend. I was upfront with how much I was willing to put down, and to their credit, the salespeople at Saturn didn't try to push me towards cars I could not afford. We traversed the lot, and that�s where I found her. A sleek, blue-black number, silently screaming, �Hey, you! Pick me!� 

I took her out for a test drive, and my dad and I agreed, she handled the roads well. I was convinced; come hell or high water, I was getting this car! The price was good, and my financing is reasonable, so I don�t feel strapped in the least. The only minor problem was Electra (yes, I name all major inanimate objects in my life) only came with a AM/FM radio, so I splurged a little for a CD player.

As far as I�m concerned, Electra (and all the little Saturns like her) handle the road quite well, except for small instances when she won�t accelerate as fast as I would like, particularly on the highway. There is no doubt that I get incredible gas mileage, and she just looks really sporty. This model is perfect for college students or lone drivers, looking for an economical car.

Well, I�m off. Going to take a spin around the neighbourhood!
