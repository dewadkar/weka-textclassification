            In response to the previous review, many people have taken good pictures with the camera. See the gallery at www.camborg.com -- a site with a gallery dedicated to WQV-1 casio camera watch users!

This watch is one of the few breakthrough 'me first' products that actually
does what it claims to do and does it well. With storage of 100 photos, and the ablility to capture a reasonable image of what you are looking at on a whim, it's absolutely priceless.

Add its on-board memory management, automatic exposure control, photo-time stamps, infra-red beaming to palm-pilot (see camborg.com for links to freeware palm app that receives and sends watch images), and to the desktop, its 5 alarms, stopwatch, and timer, and you have one great value for a very low price!

Like the previous reviewer, I got the black plastic version too, but I bought an 18mm black leather strap made by speidel that I am very happy with. You can see a photo of the strap tag for more info (its in my gallery at camborg.com :)  -- see instead of writing all the info 
down as to what exact strap I bought, I snapped a quick photo. This camera has 1001 uses, for sure.

Weirdly enough, the Canadian version comes with a coupon for a free infra-red software and receiver kit. Go figure. Guess Americans are figured to have more expendable income. Then again, they don't have 15% tax on everything they buy!

Cheers,
