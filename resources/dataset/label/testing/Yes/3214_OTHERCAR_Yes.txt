            In the price range, I have not found anything that does as well with little fuss than the DSC-85. For a fair majority of users it will suffice as a point & shoot camera, but require more patience to get superior images under less than idea conditions.
Well illuminated subjects exhibit excellent color and sharpness. Indoor and less than ideal lighting situations will require more manipulation on the part of the user to get the best results.
While I highly recommend this camera from the advanced amateur up to the semi-pro, I also strongly suggest taking the time to learn the camera's fine points as well as it's few quirks, and you will be smiling at your pictures.
Read the manual fully and go over it again when trying out various situations. Besides less than ideally lit settings, macro pictures also require more time.
If you really want to fully exploit the potential of digital photography I would also recommend a book like "How to do Everything with your Digital Camera" ($24.95 list, by Dave Johnson). It will not only teach you digital photography, but take you back to the basic essentials for all photography. 
In addition, get Adobe PhotoShop Essentials, or Photo Paint Shop Pro 7 for processing your images. 
The more control you take for taking the pictures, as well as how they are processed the more you will learn and be able to predict results before pressing that shutter.
