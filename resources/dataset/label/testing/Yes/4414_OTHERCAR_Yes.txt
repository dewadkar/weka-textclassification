            I own a 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix which I use to commute to work.  My commute is thirty miles each way and I have put on over 50,000 miles in the last two years.  I bought this vehicle from the company that I work at.  It was a Sales Manager's car and at 100,000 miles they sell the cars to employees for less than wholesale.  Adding this mileage up and yes, the Grand Prix has 155,000 miles on it.

The Grand Prix is a enjoyable car to drive.  Even with the miles it has lived through, the cab is still very air tight and new in appearance. The exterior finish is fairing very well also. It has a very quiet ride, and very little noise is transmitted to the cab of the car.  The suspension soaks up the bumps and irregularities of Minnesota roads quite well.  Since we are talking about Minnesota, this car handles snow and ice very well.  It has a &quot;second-gear start&quot; option which is like a very primitive traction control.  Quite simply you start in second gear rather than first.  This has helped me on my way on the sometimes quite slick roads of a Minnesota winter.

The seats and seating position is quite comfortable for driver and passengers, although the driver seat is a bit soft for my tastes.  We often use this car for road trips to Northern Minnesota, and it has served us well.  Gas mileage is in the city approximately 24 miles to the gallon and on the freeway around 28-30.  I enjoy the dash arrangement, especially at night.  The red dials and markings are always easy to pick up at night.  The only issues I have had with this car is that the transmission went out at 125,000.  It began to make a bad grinding sound when you decelerated at about 5-10 m.p.h.  This was an expensive repair, but is the only thing I have had to repair on the car, other than the preemptive strut repair.  
My only other complaint is with the suspension.  While it does a excellent job of soaking up anything a Minnesota road can throw at it, I would wish that is was a bit more taut, and did not wallow as much in the curves.  I even replaced the struts, even though only the rear ones had a slight leak.  This helped somewhat, but by no means solve the problem, or did I expect it to.

I think this is an excellent car for the money, and is a great car for families.  I think Pontiac has done a great job at improving this car even more in the 1997 makeover.  I would buy another Grand Prix, although I am going to look at the Intrigue, Bonneville and the VW Passat when the Grand Prix dies.  The way things have been going, that may be a long time from now.<br><br>
