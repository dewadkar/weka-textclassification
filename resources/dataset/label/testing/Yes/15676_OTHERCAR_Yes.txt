            Unlike the upper segment where the Mercedes S-Class is widely regarded as the benchmark to beat, the entry-level segment of the market has long been dominated by the BMW 3-Series as the benchmark model. In my estimation, this phenomenon is rooted deep in each manufacturer's history: Mercedes producing large, luxury sedans up until the mid 1980s (adding the compact class 190 in 1983 and E-Class in 1987), BMW producing small, compact sport sedans up until the mid 1970s (adding the 5-Series in 1975 and 7-Series in 1978). The increasing diversification of model lines throughout the 1990s has not only minimized both manufacturer's preconceived image, but it has also reached car buyers in lower price tiers previously dominated by Japanese and American brands. Interestingly, Japanese car makers are now going upmarket to broaden their customer bases. The new C-Class hopes to attract new customers by holding the line on prices while offering more performance, features, and technology in a freshly styled package.

Design studies for this new C-Class, internally known by its W203 platform code, began in June 1994, within a year of the previous generation's 1993 European introduction (1994 model year for U.S.). Unlike the Detroit manufacturers who mostly rely on CAD/CAM design, Mercedes designers used paper and pens, computers, virtual reality, and clay models to develop the new C. Twin headlamps were conceived for the face from the start, ultimately merging E-Class and S-Class design cues into a new interpretation seen in the final form. Rear taillights are corporate standard design as seen in the current S-Class, CL-Class, and SLK-Class (the forthcoming redesigns of the SL, E, and CLK class cars will also incorporate these lenses). The side profile demonstrates a subtle wedge shape evocative of a coupe design and proportions, something the previous generation C-Class seriously lacked. The rear end contains compact proportions but rear seat legroom has increased and the trunk size is very accommodating thanks to new packaging techniques. Overall, the sedan's design is more athletic and youthful, while also containing traditional Mercedes-Benz styling cues for brand recognition.

Once again, there are two separate models with two different engines. The C240 replaces the C230 as the base model with a 2.6-liter V6 engine producing 168 hp @ 5,500 rpm and 177 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm (Mercedes has, for now at least, avoided the C260 designation due to marketing confusion in Europe with a previous C260 model). The C320 replaces the C280 as the top-end model with the familiar 3.2-liter V6 engine that produces 215 hp @ 5,700 rpm and 221 lb-ft of torque between 3,000-$4,500 rpm. The 3.2 V6 is used in the E-Class, CLK-Class, SLK-Class, and M-Class vehicles. Having driven the C240 for a brief 15-minute test drive on highways and mountainous switchbacks, I can confidently say the engine was adequate (nothing impressive) but got the job done alright and made some nice muscular sounds along the way.

There is a lengthy list of standard features, but the highlights include automatic climate control with dual temperature settings, leather seating inserts, wood trim, electronic stability program (ESP), automatic slip control (ASR), 7-speaker stereo with automatic speed-sensitive volume adjustment, side &amp; head airbags for front &amp; rear seat occupants, climate controlled center storage compartment, rear cabin air vents, Tele Aid (similar to GM's OnStar, a cellular phone technology that allows you to contact Mercedes roadside assistance in emergencies, remotely unlock the doors, track the vehicle if stolen, etc), Flexible Service System (a maintenance service indicator which factors driving conditions and oil quality to determine when service is needed), and 8-way front seats with 4-way power control.

One of the first changes to the new C you'll notice is the 'ol Mercedes bank-vault solidity is now gone (yet Mercedes claims structural rigidity is improved). Shutting the door produces a softened thunk reminiscent of lighter Japanese cars now. The ride is still tuned for autobahn comfort, however, and is Lexus-quiet at any speed. Weight reduction and materials substitution are the likely reasons for why all new generation Mercedes feel like this.

The other disappointment is the view of Mercedes chrome star hood ornament is now blocked by the windshield wiper blades, as each generation of Mercedes cars have ever-more sloping front hoods. It may sound old fashioned, but, for me, one of the aspects of driving a Mercedes sedan was seeing the chrome star hood ornament peering out in front of my line of sight as I motored down the roadways. Without seeing the star, it could feel like any other German sedan.

The interior is a compact version of the S-Class sedan, in fit and feel. Front passenger space is comfortable, although I found the footwells to be surprisingly compromised by bulky packaging on either side. Rear seat space is increased from the previous model, but you won't forget that this is still a compact class sedan, either. If you want a larger sedan for $30,000, buy a Lincoln LS or Chrysler 300M. Two adults seated in the rear of the C will be comfortable; three across will not. Rear legroom is adequate for this class of car, but you won't mistake it for an S-Class ride, either. Unlike the S-Class, too, the cabin was disappointingly absent of the aroma of leather.

The instruments are derived from the current S-Class and European-market A-Class. The large speedometer makes sure you never forget how fast you're going, which is important when 80 mph feels like 50 mph in this car. The multifunction display nested within the speedometer is too complex to quickly scan -- ironic, as German automobile design used to be known for simplicity; now Mercedes is packing jet fighter info displays into its cars; is more really better? -- but I suppose after the initial few weeks of training, the driver's eye would learn how to scan the display quickly and easily. The steering wheel, with its set of multifunction buttons, is made of some kind of squishy foam material (covered in leather) which I thought was too spongy for a proper steering wheel. 

The optional $2,900 COMAND system is pricey for satellite navigation, AM/FM/WB radio, single-disc CD player, and optional phone and internet service capability. If you want to play CDs without purchasing the COMAND system, you must order the $682 6-disc CD changer that mounts inside the glove compartment. Why can't Mercedes follow BMW's lead with also offering a much simpler and cheaper $200 in-dash CD player?

The standard 6-speed manual transmission is new this year but I've heard reports that it still feels rubbery and imprecise (I did not drive a C240 with a manual, so I can't verify this) and many recommend the smooth-and-quick shifting automatic instead.  Another blunder made by Mercedes was to only offer the manual in the base C240 model and not in the higher performance C320 and upcoming C32 models. In this segment, up against the 3-Series, it was important to allow buyers the choice of either transmission to suit their individual needs. Instead, Mercedes has deemed the manual transmission a poor man's choice.

The Touch Shift automatic did not operate intuitively for me, especially in the manual mode where upshifts and downshifts are actuated by tipping the gearshift to the left or right. This is illogical movement, having been trained with manual transmissions (and watching race cars with sequential gearboxes) which engage gears forward and backward. I found it much more satisfying to just leave it in Drive and let the electronics do all the work. Furthermore, the 'ol Mercedes open shift gate is gone, along with its stubby gearshift knob atop a chrome lever. No more gear engagement with your fingertips. Now, the gearshifter requires a full hand grasp, navigating a simplified staggered shift pattern, but not allowing you to visually confirm its movements as a leather boot covers the gate now (a gear indicator in the multifunction display is your only true guide of its actions).

I am disappointed, once again, that the C6 Sport Package option replaces the tasteful wood trim with aluminum inserts and requires a Charcoal interior color specification. I'm not sure what design clinics and focus groups indicated a preference for sport packages with dark interiors and hightech-looking materials, but Mercedes seems to think this is what &quot;we&quot; want. Why then does the S-Class have a Sport Package that doesn't affect the interior specifications? Or, more appropriately, why can I order a BMW 3-Series with both Sport and Premium packages, any interior color selection, as well as the choice of either wood or aluminum trim? Furthermore, the C6 Sport Package's wheels are the same diameter (16 inches) as the standard wheels, looking rather puny in the wheel wells, especially for a 5-spoke design. At $2,900 MSRP, the Sport Package option has mis-matched specifications for enthusiasts in this segment. For approximately $900 less, I would instead recommend a set of AMG 17-inch wheels and tires, installed by the dealer or aftermarket tire center, allowing you to keep the wood trim and your choice of color leather upholstery more fitting of a proper Benz. The Sport Package's stiffer suspension, revised front airdam, subtle side skirts &amp; front/rear spats, blue-tinted glass, and sport seats would be missed, however.

Along the same lines, I recommend the C1, C2, and C3 option packages, but I must openly complain that many of these optional features should be made standard for a car costing this much money. Optional sunroof? $1,375 for optional leather inserts on the doors, head restraints, and seat bolsters? $850 Xenon headlamps are a safety item and should be standard equipment (remember how ABS brakes used to be optional equipment and now they're standard on 95% of new vehicles). Order these 'options' and the bottom-line cost quickly zooms past $35,000. Worse, the packages can't be broken apart, so you can't order a sunroof alone, it has to be the whole (expensive) package.

Option package C1 ($1,200 MSRP) includes: 10-way power front seats with 3-position memory, power steering column, driver's seat memory includes steering column and outside mirror positions.

Option package C2 ($1,340 MSRP) includes: power sunroof, rain-sensing intermittent windshield wipers, power rear window sunshade.

Option package C4 ($800 MSRP) includes: heated seats, heated headlight washers.

The competition in the compact luxury-sports sedan segment is fierce, to say the least. As I mentioned earlier, the BMW 3-Series is the favored benchmark in this class. In addition, the Audi A4 Quattro with its all-wheel-drive, will begin to lose some of its unique appeal as Mercedes and BMW offer 4WD in its compact class sedans (Mercedes 4Matic should appear on the new C-Class by 2002, BMW already offers the 325xi/330xi on 2001 models). For 2002, Jaguar will enter the compact class with its X-Type sedan with standard 4WD, too. Other competitors include the Volvo S60, Saab 9-3, Alfa Romeo 156, Acura TL, Infiniti I30t, Lexus IS300, Chrysler 300M, Cadillac Catera, and Lincoln LS. Most prospective C-Class buyers will probably consider only the BMW and Audi (and Jaguar soon) for their prestige badges. But there is also a significant group that is looking for the anti-prestige luxury-sports sedan, hence the new Volvo S60 and the slew of Japanese and American offerings to cater to their needs.

Like Audi and BMW, Mercedes offers an attractive warranty program to further entice your decision. Bumper-to-bumper warranty coverage is for 48 months/50,000 miles. Free-of-charge regularly scheduled maintenance is for the same term. Roadside assistance and the Tele Aid link are also offered.

In summary, the new C240 is for certain a much-improved model than its predecessor while also closing the gap between it and the benchmark BMW 3-Series competition. For its sheer offerings of features, technologies, and safety equipment, it represents a tremendous value for buyers who seek first-time entry into the world of Mercedes ownership, as well as retaining previous C-Class customers in the fold. In addition, it is also much more rewarding to drive than the previous C230. I doubt the new C will convert many fans of the 3-Series, as that car still has the performance edge with its manual transmission available with the top-trim engines, as well as 17-inch wheels and tires in its Sports Package. But if you are looking for a new Mercedes on a budget, or are looking to &quot;graduate&quot; from the luxury Japanese or American sedans, the new C240 is a great choice.<br><br>
