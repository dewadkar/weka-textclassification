            I bought my 1995 Acura Integra GS-R a little more than two years ago, and have been quite happy with it.  The first thing you notice about the car when you get in are those comfortable leather seats (if you get that option).  The car is a very nice sports car, with a 0-60 of about 6 and a half seconds.  The engine red-line is at 8100 rpm, higher than any other car anywhere near this car's price range.  The car turns corners so well, you'd think you were glued to the road.  The stick is a pleasure to use. I bought the car loaded with just about every option, two years old, for $17,000.  If you are looking for a great sports car for under $25,000 (new), this is the best you will find.  But remember that maintenance on sports cars is very high.  With tires at $200+ each, you have to have plenty set aside to keep this car running.  A problem with this car (and many sports cars), is that you can only fit in ONE passenger comfortably.  Also, if you decide to get a used car, go for the 'preferred preowned' type.  But BEWARE: The preowned cars have a full warranty, but only if the parts are still Acura parts.  My passenger window's motor (a $300 job) broke three weeks after I bought the car, and Acura refused to pay for it, because the person who had the car before had replaced the motor with a non-Acura part.  I'm not happy with their service, but the car is still pretty good.  And remember this: owning a sports car gives you the incentive to drive 75 on side roads.  I have no points on my license anymore, and want to keep it that way.  Either have a little will-power, or get a different car.<br><br>
