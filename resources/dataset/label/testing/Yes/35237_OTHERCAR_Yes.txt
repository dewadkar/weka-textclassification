            I was looking for a newer (range 1994-1996) car about 3 months ago.  I research the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Pathfinders, Monteros, and Troopers.  I Bought the Trooper for several reasons.  One the crash test was a high safety number, no mechanical defects (unlike the Jeep), and the price point.  Troopers are very reasonable.  They have been making the same model for years.  That alone told me that this is a safe, dependable car.  I can load alot into and the seats are not only spacious but very comfortable.

I love that I am high up and can see everything.  The only thing I don't like is the gass mileage. I get about 300 miles per tank and I was used a car's mileage tank. But the secure feeling of driving a dependable SUV out ways almost everything.  

Who shouldn't buy this vehicle is anyone that needs a large tank with lots of gas mileage with it.  Anyone can really buy this car.  It is great to load things in it and out.  To get in and out.  I have back problems and I hated to get down into my car.  Now it is a relief!

I love my Trooper!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
