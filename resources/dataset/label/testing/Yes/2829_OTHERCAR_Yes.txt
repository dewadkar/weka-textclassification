            The 2001 Lexus GS Sedan is a wonderful addition to the already prominent Lexus family.  What first attracted me to this vehicle was it's sleek design.  Once I surpassed my more superficial desires, however, I discovered that the car had much more to offer than merely a pretty exterior.  I test drove the car around some difficult city driving and then on the highway.  In both situations the car handled every twist in the road with great.  What really blew me away was the acceleration.  You can move from 0 to 10 or from 30 to 70 and you will feel very little turbulence from the engine.
The engine itself, I am told because of special material in the hood, is whisper quiet even at highway speeds.  Once at highway speeds, the steering becomes more sensitive adding increased stability.  It's center of mass is relatively low compared to some of the other sedans on the market, therefore loss of control of the car is not really an issue, even at highway speeds.  It is surely more stable than some of the leading SUVs on the market.
The trunk space is average.  The interior is superb as the buyer has come to expect of Lexus.  Though the car is expensive, it is definitely worth a second look, especially if you were about to spend $35,000 or more on a similar car, or even on a similar Lexus.  This vehicle will not let you down.
