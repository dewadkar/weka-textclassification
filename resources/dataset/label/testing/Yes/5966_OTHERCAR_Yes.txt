            I always aspired to be a &quot;Ferrari guy&quot; or a &quot;Porsche guy&quot;, but then I grew up and became more practical.  Well, I suppose my bank account helped me to grow.  Alas, when it came time to buy that next car I knew I wanted it to be a del Sol.  

Many Honda-philes would call me a heretic because I was seeking a del Sol Si model with an automatic transmission.  Not having a manual seems to be an offense worthy of excommunication.  Indeed, it took almost a year to find because Honda makes proportionately fewer of them.

Alas, the gods smiled upon me and I found the car I was looking for after a year.  Each day since has been an adventure in what fun a car should be -- especially the warm, sunny days which enable the true beauty of the car to be enjoyed --- (almost)topless motoring.

What do I love/hate about the car?  I love that it is a wonderful balance of fun and practical (at laest for 2 people!!!) and does everything well. I did learn the hard way that it really wasn't made to carry a 19-inch television in the trunk -- but the tv did fit in the front seat and my girlfriend fit in the trunk.  Luckily she is not a claustrophobic person, but I understand that each minute seemed to last longer for her.  Thankfully, I do not buy televisions every weekend.

The car handles amazingly well on snow and ice for such a light car -- I would not have driven the slick roads I have in a Miata. Honda's rear window design (a glass rear window which rolls down to decrease wind-buffeting) is remarkably effective.

If you haven't guessed from the above, then yes, I would recommend this car.  If you need a large car or to seat more than two people (or one person and a television), then I recommend you upgrade to the Accord.  Otherwise, you will have quite the grin on your face each sunny day (not to mention each time you fill the gas tank).<br><br>
