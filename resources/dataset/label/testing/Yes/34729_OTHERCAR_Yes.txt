            My wife was looking for a car to replace the Jeep Wrangler I used to have.  I had traded in my Wrangler for a Grand Cherokee because I had gone long enough without A/C.  We had our Grand Cherokee for about a month when she decided she couldn't live without some type of convertible for the summer.

We looked at various convertibles, but the only one that had a legitimate backseat (and was still in our price-range) was the Sebring.  The dealer only had two on the lot, but fortunately we liked the color/style of one of them - a blue JXi.

Within a week of buying the Sebring, we had to take it back to have hard water stains removed from the front windshield.  The dealer referred (and paid for) us to its glass company for removal, which was very easy.

About a week after that, we noticed a few small paint chips on the hood.  At first, I thought that I had gotten behind a large truck and it had thrown some stones up onto the car.  After further investigation, we saw more chips on the front quarter-panel and rear quarter-panel.  There was no way that stones did all this.  We took the car in to the dealer and were told that we needed to bring it back when the regional rep was in.  I'll edit this later as this continues.

Regarding the rest of the car...it is spectacular.  The top is easy for anyone to put down or up in seconds.  The power/pickup is excellent and the seats are comfortable as well.  The sound system is awesome with the top up or down.  I highly recommend the car to anyone looking for a convertible that holds 4 people comfortably.<br><br>
