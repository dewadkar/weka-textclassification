            At speeds greater than 125 mph, the needle on the speedometer of a 1999 Porsche Boxster is no longer visible to the passenger.  I witnessed this many times riding with my driving instructor in her red Porsche Boxster at a recent driving seminar.  During the two sessions that I was with her (which I will never forget), I am certain I experienced this car the way its designers intended.

At 125 mph you can hear the wall of air you are trying to pierce through as it gusts and lashes very sharply at the cockpit.  There are other subtle changes as well.  A hundred feet, the distance between markers in a critical braking zone, seem to run together as your senses struggle to mark them off while in the car.  With each passing lap, my instructor delayed braking, pushing the car to its absolute limits. Late in the session, she began braking on the third marker in, giving herself only 300 feet to take us from near 130 to 80 mph. In my mind I was screaming &quot;Brake! Brake!&quot; and questioning my sanity for being a passenger as I watched her, thankfully, maintain control of the car. She was consistent and very skilled, keeping us out of a world of hurt. As the brakes finally grabbed, the forward g-force was tremendous.  The Boxster slowed rapidly and stayed straight, settled down, and was ready for whatever came next.

The Boxster never failed to go in the direction it was pointed.  Not once did it slide, or even hint it might.  It always braked straight and true, even late into a punishing session. With the mid-engine layout of the car, the traction seemed almost limitless.  While the interior and fit and finish of this car was very nice, I really feel that the best part of this car is not visible to the eye:  the suspension.

While the road holding capabilities of the Boxster suspension were impressive, its manners on the rough pit areas were that of a luxury car.  Again, the suspension demonstrated a design sophisticated enough to deliver what was needed, without even an adjustment required.  As a daily driver, the Porsche Boxster would be perfect.  Not many sports cars can double as both a daily driver and an outstanding track car for the weekend.
