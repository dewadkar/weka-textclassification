            I just bought the 2000 model 2WD V6 hardtop with full options and I must say that this SUV is awesome.  It is a little bouncy, but no more than any of the trucks I have owned and the V6 provides serious thrust.  I got the optional tow package and it easily pulls my trailer with two roadrace bikes on it and I pull it over some pretty steep mountain passes!  There have been no problems yet, but admittedly I've only had the vehicle for a little while.  At this point though, I'd have to say that this is the best rig I have ever owned in terms of grin factor and fun per $.<br><br>
