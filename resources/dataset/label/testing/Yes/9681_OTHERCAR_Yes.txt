            As a future trailer hauler, and the son of one already, I have witnessed the Dodge Ram 2500's (diesel) ability to pull some of the biggest campers I have seen.  They don't bog down when going up even 30 degree hills (I know this from experience!  Some of the older men in our camping group (some hardcore Ford and Chevy fans) even drop their jaws at the Cummins' raw torque.  There is a smooth, consistent torque band that just seems to keep giving power to your right foot.  The owners of Dodges are extremely loyal, and there's even a Dodge Ram Cummins Diesel Registry with something like 1,000,000 members (don't quote me)! Bottom line: this Dodge is a potent one!<br><br>
