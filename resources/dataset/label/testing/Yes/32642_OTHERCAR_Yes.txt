            A family member owns this car, a base model 97' sunfire, I absolutly love it, it's got great pickup, I can burn rubber all the way through second gear, comfortable, great suspension. Overall it has been more than worth the money paid. The handling is completly predictable, feels good when driving, the airbags are just right, after 3 accidents with light damage they have not gone off, i'm glad because all 3 were just bumper denters(do they work?).

The shifter is not very refined, you have to get it just right or it feels like your bumping into dividers between the gears, otherwise it's very smooth, I recomend shortening it. There is plenty of room in the front, but since it is a 2 door model the space in the back is limited, but still greater than most coupe's.

Interior is not high quality, but there is no rattles, squeaks, or anything, it has held up very well. So far there has only been small electrical problems, it use to not start on very damp days, the dealer fixed under warranty.

After 100k km the car is starting to sound warn, the engine runs smooth but it sounds rough. Break ware is very minimal, still on the original pads, ABS is very bumpy, mostly because of the suspension, which otherwise holds up extremly well.
