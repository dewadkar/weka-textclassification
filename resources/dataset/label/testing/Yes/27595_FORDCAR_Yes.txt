With all the problems surrounding the Ford Explorer, the <b>Ford Escape</b> is about the only thing keeping a smile on your local dealers face. These cars are selling faster than Blues Clues videos at a pre-school convention � and having driven one for a few weeks I can understand why

<b>The Market</b>

Originally targeted at the low-end SUV market (around $18-23k) the Escape, and many of its competitors, are cannibalizing the lower end of the regular SUV market (Explorer, Pathfinder) as well as the family sedan. The Escape happens to be one of the bigger mini-SUV�s featuring a wider wheelbase and larger cargo space than most of the competition. Combining a sporty exterior, decent performance, good mileage and that <I>�SUV look�</I> Ford has a winner on its hands here.

Ford says that 44% of Escape buyers are women � a new SUV market � and 2/3 of the buyers are new Ford customers.

<b>The Engine</b>

We�re driving a Ford Escape XLT 4x4WD with a 3 liter engine. The three litre engine, a 24 valve V6 Duratec is the most important feature of this car. Yielding 201 HP and 196 ft-lbs of torque its enough to whiz the Escape around corners and accelerate to 60 in under 9 seconds (8.8 for the speed demons out there). The 2.0 litre base model is woefully underpowered and I wouldn�t recommend it to anyone. The extra 76 horses make all the difference in the world between a zippy car and a sluggish lawnmower. (See my review of the Kia Sportage).

<b>The Interior</b>

The Escape is essentially the Mazda Tribute by any other name and the Mazda engineers have obviously had some input to the styling. Having said that the controls are a little crowded � the dinky column shift obscures some of the stereo controls, the fog lamps are hard to find and I still can�t start the car without looking at the ignition. Most of the interior is functional hard plastic. So admittedly we�re not paying for a Mercedes, but a little better aesthetics would help.

Despite this, there is a lot of space in the Escape. The back can hold 65 ft3 of cargo with the seats down and folded flat. Passengers in the rear seat have plenty of room � a 6ft 2in friend had head and legroom, and we managed to fit three teenagers in there without too much whining and complaining. There are also floor ducts for heating and cooling � a nice touch some of the competitors don�t have.

<b>Safety</b> 

Front driver and passenger airbags are standard, as are anti-lock brakes (not on the XLS) and side door intrusion beams. Side impact airbags are an option, but good luck in finding any vehicles equipped with them that aren�t red (go figure).

It is worth noting that the 2000 models had at least 5 recalls � including the steering wheel falling off � the 2001-2 models are so far clean.

<b>The Exterior</b>

Like most Fords you have a variety of colors to chose from, ranging from Bright Red and Chrome Yellow to a more sedate Wedgewood Blue or Highland Green. Models come with an adjustable roofrack which can be upgraded to an optional �No Boundaries� rack which covers the rear too. Side step bars are an option too. I liked the fact 
That the XLT comes with a trailer hitch and has a 3500 lb towing capacity � again practically unrivalled in its class.

<b>Options</b>

So by now you know that the 3L engine is a must. All models offer items like power windows/steering (unlike say the Nissan Xtrerra), air conditioning. The XLT offers fog lamps, bigger tires, anti-lock brakes, cruise control and premium seats (incl a 60./40 back split seat). You can order a super-duper CD system , moonroof, airbags and a few other items, but basically that�s it. Of course, I�m assuming that if you buy this car you�d get the 4WD instead of the 2WD. The 2WD offers better mileage, the 4WD offers always-on or auto-engagement.

<b>Financing Issues</b>

As of Summer 2001 Ford is offering no special deals � either cashback or reduced interest rates as an incentive to buy. However, unlike some of their Japanese competitors they don�t have the chutzpah to charge an extra $600 as a regional demand adjustment. Ford offers standard 8.9% financing for a lease or purchase. With reasonable credit you can do better from your local bank or S&L. For a great rate (6.75%) try peoplefirst.com.

If you work for a large multi-national corporation see if your employer has an X-Plan arrangement with Ford. It could save you another $750!

<b>Final Thoughts</b>

Am I suffering buyers remorse after buying this vehicle � NO. 
Does it meet my needs � YES.
Am I comfortable driving it � YES.
Would I recommend it to a friend ? � YES.
