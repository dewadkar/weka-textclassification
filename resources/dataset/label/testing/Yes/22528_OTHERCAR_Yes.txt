            My 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier was the first car I had ever bought all on my own.  I remember being so proud of myself for buying by myself.  I bought in April of 1995, it had about 20,000 miles on it. 

I bought it from United Olds Mazda in Dyersburg, Tennessee.  I paid about $9,000 for it then.  The payments on it were about $245.00 a month.

It was bright red, the bumpers and door handles were black.  It was a two door and an automatic.  The gear shift was located between the front seats in the floor.  It had tilt, AM/FM radio with cassette player and air and heat.

The interior was charcoal gray.  The front seats were bucket style seats.  The backseat was alright as far as comfort, not good for folks with long legs though.  It has a huge trunk.  I could really load up the trunk for a road trip.

The car was very roomy in the front.  There were no airbags in the car.  The car rode very well for a small car.  It never made any noises or shook while driving.

The car got great gas mileage for me.  I could fill it up on Friday and it would last me all week long, unless I was going out of town.  I drove this car everywhere.

The car never gave me any problems at all.  I kept the oil changed in it and took care of the tires.  After I met my husband and got married, I wasn't that crazy about the car because his son was still in a car seat.  It was awful to me to try to get him in the seat in the back and get it buckled.

However, I would drive it now or at least a newer model because now there are no car seats.  The kids can get in and out by themselves.

This is a good car for folks who don't need a lot of room or travel a lot because it gets great gas mileage.  They are very sporty looking and comfortable.  if you don't believe me then take one for spin.  I am sure you can find a used on the local car lot.

Thanks for reading and have a great night!!
