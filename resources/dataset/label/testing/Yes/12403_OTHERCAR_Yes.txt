            I bought my Cadillac Catera because I was looking for a luxury car in the 30k price range.  Originally I wanted a Toyota Avalon, but the financing was ridiculous!  I lease my cars, and would've had to put way too much money down and lease the car for 5 years.  Cadillac offered a 30 month lease with 2.9% financing.  Another car I looked at was the BMW 300 series, but these cars can't compare in size!  They are way too small and overpriced.  My Catera handles well, accelerates well and so far, no break downs.  I especially like the ON STAR system that came with the car free, for one year.  The customer service that Cadillac provides is beyond compare.  The sales person went above and beyond the call of duty when he personally lent me his car while my windows were being tinted.  Cadillac offers roadside assistance to all of it's customers and I feel they go out of their way to make the buyer experience the difference in buying a luxury car vs. an economy car.<br><br>
