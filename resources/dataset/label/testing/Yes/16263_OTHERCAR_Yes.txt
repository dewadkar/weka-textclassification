            I purchased this car in March of 99. It is driven mainly by my wife and she loves it. I on the other hand only drive it occasionally and I find it a little too small for my liking. It has a good ride and being the Le model it has a very nice interior and enough gadgets to keep you happy. I am much bigger than my wife and therefore I do feel more cramped. Of course it is not a large car so you cannot expect the luxury of a larger vehicle. Over all I really like the car and would say buy one. One of the biggest pluses is the fact that a used Toyota holds its value year after year. It shifts smoothly and handles very well, all controls are very legible and within easy reach. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the best I would give it a 7.     <br><br>
