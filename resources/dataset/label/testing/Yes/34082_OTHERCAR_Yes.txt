            After 3 months of use, including quick shots in all kinds of lighting during the holidays, I now believe digital cameras can replace the 35mm SLR for most users. First to some concerns others have noted.  You can save your desired settings as defaults for the next time you turn on the camera (see All Reset in the Mode Setup menu). 

While the LCD image of a picture tends to look over exposed at times, the pictures actually saved and viewed or printed have been excellent. Getting a SmartMedia Reader on my Win ME computer, images processed by Picture It!, and printed via an HP ink jet have been no problems.  8x10's of a variety of 2 and 3 MB images have been impressive.  The flash is not as good as an external unit on my SLR, but is still quite adequate for the typical inside family shots.  Fill flash and long flash-off exposures work well. The fast lens is invaluable.  I had no problems with the remote control.   

Battery life has been very good. I use the LCD most of the time to get the image framed properly.  The reassurance of AA's working in a pinch is nice.  The 128MB non-OEM Smart Media card works perfectly.  

I have found the menus and controls quite reasonable.  Study the menu structure via the LCD (a button turns it on) and practice.  I haven't found any meaningful errors in the manual, but some of the exposure compensation adjustments (with vs without flash) are not clear.  Everyone would arrange the menu structure differently.  I wish some adjustments were built into the mode dial and back buttons instead of where they are in the menus. I fastened the lens cap with the included strap and have trained myself to always take it off before turning the camera mode dial from OFF to P ("on") since the lens extends.  All in all these are minor learning experiences and issues for an excellent camera.
