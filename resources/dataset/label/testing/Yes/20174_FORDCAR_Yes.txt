            We did extensive research and drove every mini-van in town.  This is the fifth mini-van that we have owned, but the first Ford.  We love the car.  The built in TV and VCR are wonderful for the kids.  The car rides beautifully, has lots of room, nice features, and is generally a perfect car.  So far, (3 months) we haven't found anything about this car that we do not like.  It even gets better mileage than was advertised.  We recommend this car with no reservations. For the first time, we have chosen to lease, and this is also a good experience.  We plan to get another Windstar in 2 years, and our lease payment is only $350 per month.<br><br>
