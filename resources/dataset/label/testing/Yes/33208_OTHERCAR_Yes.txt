            My friend recently purchased this fine automobile along with several others as he is trying to start a collection of classy automobiles.  I have had the pleasure of riding along with him several times recently and I can truly tell you that this car has it all.

First of all this car is very stylish and reminds me of the cars from an old James Bond movie.  It has power everything, seats, windows, CD remote, cruise, basically anything you would ever want.  One of the features that I find unique and enjoy the most is the motion detector and voice synthesis control.  The motion detector tells you how far you are away from objects and lets you know when people are nearing your vehicle on the highway.  Also, with this great mobile you can talk to a computer which will welcome you(by synthesized voice when you enter and will also give you spoken instructions for directions or mileage for long trips.  Furthermore, the Bentley gives and extremely comfortable ride and really feels as though you are riding on air.

There are a couple of drawbacks to this vehicle that will not allow many to purchase it.  First of all it is outrageously expensive with a price nearing 300,000 dollars.  This makes the car impossible to even test drive unless you can prove you have serious funds in the bank.  The second complaint that I have about this otherwise brilliant machine is that it is a bit too long for my taste.  It is very tricky to park and to drive through tight quarters.  

Otherwise though, the Bentley has it all.  There is virtually no standard feature that you will not find on the car and even a few that will surprise you.  If you have a few hundred thousand dollars to throw aimlessly into the wind I guess your money might as well land on this classy car.<br><br>
