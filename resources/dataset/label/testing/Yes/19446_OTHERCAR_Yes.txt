                 The Mazda Millenia is often described as Mazda's "best kept secret!" I couldn't agree more. You'll often find that many perspective buyers don't go looking at the Mazda lot for an upscale sedan, worthy for the business affair, black tie affair, or any other kind of "affair" out there. Well they don't know what they're missing. 

     The Millenia, specifically the Millenia S, which is the Millenia's Sport trimline, blends sleek edgey styling, with upscale business accomidations. People need not fear when they think, "Well it's not an ES300, or an Acura TL," these upscale models, just happen to compete with the competent Millenia. And it's my pleasure to say that the Millenia competes favorably with the ES300, TL, and I30. Keeping in mind that the ES300 was redesigned this year and would not apply to this review, seeing how it's based on a 1999 Milleina and its competitors at that time.

     The Millenia's sports-sedan exterior design is eye catching, and retains distinction in the competitive upscale sedan market. The car uses no antenna, keeping the design lines sleek and uninhibited. The "S" trimline comes with 17 inch. alloy rims, and a V6 Miller Cycle engine, that can push out 210hp, impressive by far. 

     Once inside the Millenia, plush leather seating and nicely touched chrome accents, invite you into the cockpit. Even the "wood" surfaces don't come off as overdone. The powerful Bose sound system works extremely well, and controls are easy to use and see. The front seats are very comfortable, and can even be made more comfortable with complimentary dual seat heaters. The rear seat is a little tight headroom wise, but is still welcoming enough for rear passengers. Unfortunately the rear lacks cupholders. The car feels solid, and most interior details are addressed in this car.

     Drive the Millenia S, and you feel the cool power from the Miller Cycle V6, under the hood. The ride is silent, and smooth, though the Lexus ES300 I found had a softer ride, but too little of road feel. Seeing out is easy, and keeping with the flow of traffic is a piece of cake. However, the brakes could be better, but than again the car reaches 60mph in a flash, so you decide how long it's gonna take to stop. The suspension soaks up almost all road bumps and the car gives you a strong sense of security. Emergency handling is also very good, I would know because I've had to avoid being hit the first week I got it! It would've been nice to have side airbags as well, but Mazda didn't install them into the 99 models of the Millenia.

     The Millenia is a solid choice for reliability, styling, and the fact that not every other person on the road drives one.
