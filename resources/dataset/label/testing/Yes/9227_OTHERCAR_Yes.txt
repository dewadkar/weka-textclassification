                 I just bought a new Subaru Impreza Wagon L, and I am really amazed at this car! It is my first new car, prior to this I was driving a rusty '84 Chevy wagon. This car seriously amazes me and I definitely recommend it to anyone. It's a car with universal appeal -- it's practical and very useful but still manages to look youthful and almost sporty. Being a young male and a bassist, I like sporty cars but need room for my bass, and this is probably the best compromise out there. I also needed something affordable, and although the price is a little steep for a compact, I think it's worth it.

     When you drive this car the first thing you notice is the growl of the engine. It doesn't sound cheap like most compacts, and the car really scoots off the line. In fact the throttle is a little TOO responsive in the first bit of pedal travel, so you jerk the car back and forth at first. The steering feels great too--smooth, quick, and responsive. But the handling is the most amazing part. Throw this car into a curve and it just grips. No tire squeal, no body lean, it just goes. Several times I've steered the car into a sharp bend, looked down at the speedo, and been surprised by how much I am speeding! You feel invincible in corners--probably not a great car for the new driver in the house. And personally, I like the ride, which is stiff and sports-car-like, but I could imagine many folks would think it too choppy. 

    The inside is nice too. Everything looks classy, with the exception of the hard-plastic dash top. The steering wheel and shifter are made out of expensive-feeling stuff, and the seats are firm and hold you in place. Again, I can imagine that firmness could make folks who like a smooth ride uncomfortable. The dash is laid out very well, and the controls are pretty straightforward. The back seat is a little tight even for two, but I'm sure smaller kids wouldn't mind it. One major drawback: The standard radio is awful, with muddy midrange, no bass kick, and not much treble definition. 

    Overall I recommend this car to just about anyone on a somewhat-tight budget. If you wish you had a sports car, just don't look backwards and you'll think you're in a sporty coupe. And if you wish you had a wagon the practicality aspect won't disappoint either. So at least give it a test drive if you're in the market, I drove a Daewoo Nubira and a Suzuki Esteem too, and I'll tell you the Subaru is worth the extra couple thousand for the gain in safety, quality,and driving fun. <br><br>
