            I've had two of the Qx4's and am totally in love.  Yes, they have been known for being under-powered, but I hear they fixed that for 2000.  The gas mileage is not great, but not much worse than other SUV's on the market.  Then again, this vehicle is heads and shoulders above any Explorer or Blazer or other SUV's you've ever driven in.  I test drove them all (Jeeps, too) and when I got in the Infinity I was in love and that was my choice.  I leased that one for only two years, was sorry to have to turn it in, and am now on my second one.  You can't beat the looks, the feel on the inside, the stereo, the seat positions, the cargo space.  If you can afford to go the few extra bucks over an Explorer or Jeep, you won't be sorry!!

Additionally, I have had two service visits in more than three years on two different Qx4's!!  Try that with a Ford or Chevy!!  Not only that, but I was given an Infiniti as a loaner while it was in for service!!  Can't beat it!! I have never experienced this kind of service anywhere, and I've had a LOT of vehicles over the years!!!
