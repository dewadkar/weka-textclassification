            When I wrote my last review, I had not picked up my new Odyssey from the dealership.  Now, I've driven it for a little over a month and have tached on 1400 miles.  With a little more perspective, I'll rate the minivan in power, transmission, handling, braking, ergonomics, comfort, convenience, and overall satisfaction.

<b>POWER -- 8.5</b>
The Odyssey comes with a 3.5 liter V6 VTEC engine that pumps out 210 HP.  By the sheer numbers, this is one powerful engine.  However, this is also one heavy vehicle as it weighs a little over 4300 lbs with the navigation system.  With this engine on a lighter vehicle, the power will surely rank a 10.  Zero to sixty takes about 10 seconds to haul this minivan, which is run of the mill, due to its weight.  At highway passing speeds however, this baby moves.  Without trying, the Odyssey easily cruises beyond 80 mph.  Cruising at 80 mph the tachometer loafs below 2200 rpm.  On the highway, this van doesn't break a sweat.  At idle, the engine is whisper quiet.  Don't turn the ignition key twice!

<b>TRANSMISSION -- 7.5</b>
Honda has really improved in this area.  I still remember feeling every gear shift in the old Accords, that sudden jerking feeling.  And even in my 95 Accord, you can feel it throughout the gear shifts.  In this Odyssey, you can still feel in the first two gears, but much improved indeed.  If you don't try to notice, you may not feel it.  My biggest gripe here is in the first two gears.  It seems the automatic transmission is unwilling to let go of its first gear, even when speeds are well into a comfortable second gear shift.  Because it holds on longer, the shifting in this gear is inevitably stronger.  And even in second gear, this seems to be a problem, although not as bad as in first.  Besides this, the transmission is smooth.

<b>HANDLING -- 7.5</b>
This is a minivan after all.  Although the Odyssey comes with 4 wheel independent suspension, its weight and height curbs its handling.  Everything about it feels like a car, except the weight.  You want to take that exit ramp at 50 mph?  Maybe if it weighed 1000 lbs less!  I will admit, I was shocked that I could take a 25 mph exit ramp at a little over 40 mph.  Please, don't jump out and take all 25 mph exit ramps at 40 mph!  All ramps are not the same.  What really makes you slow down, is the lack-of-lateral-support seats!  I'll get to that in a minute.  However, during daily routine drives, this minivan is sure footed and handles well.  

<b>BRAKING -- 7.5</b>
Since this is a heavy vehicle, it takes a lot to stop it and requires a longer braking distance.  I usually do not break hard when I drive as I am not a fashionable tailgator.  However, I have at times been caught off guard trying to stop my Odyssey and had to break hard at the last minute, especially when exiting the highway.  This may be attributed to my accord-like driving experience.  To shorten the braking distance, Honda should toss in larger disc brakes.  Don't get me wrong, this car is not at all dangerous to stop, just some improvements can help.  The anti-lock and Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) systems are pluses in this area.

<b>ERGONOMICS -- 9</b>
This is a Honda after all.  Everything is where it should be.  Well almost everything.  Easy to read dashboard, in day and night.  Easy to use shifter (no gripes here although many people complain about it), levers, controls, knobs, cd player and navigation system.  Some things that can improve are lighted door controls, the need for an LCD clock without going through the nav system, wider shifter and CD controls separation, nav controls on the driver side instead of on the passenger side, and a higher mounted power outlet.

<b>COMFORT -- 7.5</b>
I would have given this category a 9 if it wasn't for the laterally non-supportive seats.  As I mentioned in my first review, there is no lateral support in the seats, in any position.  Make a turn a little sharp, and the driver and passengers are bracing for their lives!  Well, okay it's not <i>that</i> bad, but a definite <b>BIG</b> minus here.  The arm rest built in the door can also use <b>a lot</b> more padding.  Wind noise at highway speeds seems a little excessive given the ambience of the vehicle, although I have read that it is above average in this category.  Everything else, from the auto-climate to the reading lights, and everything in between, this van is comfortable.  One other thing, the Odyssey EX should have come with leather seating.

<b>CONVENIENCE -- 10</b>
Everything here is what it should be.  Let's start with the center tray.  This tray is collapsible.  If mommy or daddy wants to get back to the rear seats, just fold it into the passenger seat and the exposed center is now a pass-through.  It has four cup holders in it at the four corners.  For the rear passenger, it would be hard to get to their drinks if it wasn't for the pullout feature.  You can pull out the tray toward the rear passengers.  This also gives a huge top, which can be used for those burgers and fries.  As with cup holders, there are nine of them: four up front, two for the second row through the center tray, and three in the rear.  Each passenger gets it's own reading light and air conditioning vent (except the mid-passenger in the rear).  A/C can also be controlled by the second row passengers.  The second row captain chairs can be easily converted into a bench.  These second row seats are also easy to remove.  The third row magic seat folds flush into the huge well, so there's no need to remove them.  Because the well is so deep, nothing rolls out of it.  This is great for groceries.  The electronic side doors are also convenient as they can be controlled via the electronic remote as well as from dash mounted door controls.  Lifting the door handle also activates it.  The navigation system is the icing on the cake.  As I have already reviewed it the last time, I won't get into it again.  I will say that it is easy to use and accurate.  You'll never get lost again.

<b>OVERALL -- 9</b>
Hey, the number don't average out!  Well, I do have my personal tilt.  For a minivan, this is a champ.  Everything about this van is solid.  With power to spare, great ergonomics, top rate conveniences, near perfect fit and finish, and a great safety record (look at my last review for this subject) the Odyssey is in a class by itself.

<b>COMPLAINTS</b>
Nothing is perfect.  As I have mentioned over and over again, the laterally non-supportive seating is my biggest complaint.  Giving it more lateral support in the thighs and torso will give the driver more confidence in its handling.  It will provide more overall comfort as well.  My other complaint, is in its steering wheel design.  The wheel is closer to the driver on the right than it is on the left!  What this means is that your left arm is always more extended than your right.  I went back to the dealership with this but as I inspected the other new Odysseys, all of them had this problem.  I will say I'm a little disappointed that Honda let this one slip by.  In the end, I'm very satisfied with my Odyssey.
