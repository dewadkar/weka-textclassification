            I looked at so many SUVs in trying to make up my mind. Which One!
Well after researching it extensively we decided on the Land Rover Disco II. The A.C.E. is a must if you do alot of city and highway driving. And the important thing is that ACE doesn't inhibit the off-road capabilities of the Disco II. In fact the hydraulic actuators that control the sway bars in sharp city turns also help off-road in that it articulates the suspension for safer handling. When I asked other car makers (dealers) about any option that would do this with their vehicles, they said WHAT! SORRY!
Anyway There have been problems with pre-97 Discos regarding the engine management, but since the rovers went to Bosch and left the old Lucas kiss of death behind the trails have been a lot smoother. I would highly recommend this vehicle to any serious outdoors person. 5 stars all the way.

Update 6/26/00

Well after driving it for a month and 2,000 miles I must say I am quite happy with my choice. There was an initial leak under the engine that wound up being a loose clamp which was replaced. Took the family to Yosemite for a week and put 1,000 miles on the vehicle. The rover dealer told me that since the vehicle was brand new, I might need to add a little oil. But that was not needed. The vehicle is a champ the whole way. Also was able to do a little off-road, and it did shine. I tackled a few roads that actually a few other people with SUVs had trouble with. ( Jeep, Merc, and explorer) by the wayside. Anyway so far very comfortable and very capable.

Update 7/18/2001

Well I have been motoring for over a year in my Discovery  Series II. I have put 17500 miles on it. I have done many trips. Death Valley, Mojave Desert, Badlands. In all this not one problem. I am very impressed with it's performance. On the Mojave trip I even helped a couple of vehicles that got stuck in bad situations. Jeep and Mercedes off roaders. I am still very happy with my choice. Please Tread Lightly. Respect your fellow  traveler.
