            If you are reading this opinion, then it is safe to say that you are considering a used Audi A6.  I won't repeat the other opinions on this page because I agree with all the owners who love their Audi A6.  Instead, I thought I might tell you why I bought a used Audi A6 like you soon will.

I shopped for a new car for nearly a year before I finally settled on this car.  I was ready to buy a 2001 Audi A4, but I just couldn't convince myself that it was worth the $30,000-plus price tag.  Granted, the A4 is a nice car, but it is small.  By buying used, I spent less money and got more car.

One of the nice things about Audi is that from year to year, they usually don't change much.  They tend to design their cars right the first time and then stick with their designs for awhile.  There is very little different between the 1998 model of the A6 and the 2001 model.  So, if you are avoiding used cars because they are out of style or not as prestigious as a new car, Audi is definitely worth looking at.  All my friends who see this car think it is one of the new models until I tell them that it is 3 years old.

Another good reason to consider a used Audi is for the easy access to the maintenance records.  Since all new Audis include 3-years of maintenance for free, their owners always take the car to the dealer when it needs maintenance.  Therefore, I was able to get the complete and accurate maintenance history on my car by just supplying the VIN number to the local Audi dealership.  They where able to tell me all the maintenance history right down to the mile as well as all the warranty claims that were made by the previous owner.

I actually bought my Audi at a BMW dealership.  One might think that they picked up this car as a trade-in, but they told me it was actually bought from a leasing company.  Even though these guys sell BMWs day in and day out, they couldn't say anything bad about this car.  They think the Audi is on par with their BMWs and is worthy to be on the same small lot.
