            I was in the market for a good used car. I had heard about how Oldsmobile had won so many MotorTrend car of the year awards in the '80's. I found my 1997 Oldsmobile Achieva in the summer of 1999. It had only 38,000 miles on it. It was a shiny black SL trim model. It had a 3.1 v6, 15 inch factory rims, traction control, ABS, daytime running lights, and a radio antenna intergrated into the rear defrost grid. 

This car has received many comments such as &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;sporty&quot;.  It seems rare that such comments are made about a 4 door sedan. The v6 is fantastic. It offers smooth confident acceleration and the automatic overdrive gives me 29 mpg. The 15 inch tires hug the turns and ride very well. The sound system is the best factory radio/cassette system I have ever heard. 

The safety features offered in this car are what really sold me. It has what GM calls &quot;Enhanced Traction System&quot;, dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, daytime running lights and automatic light control. I purchased a extended warranty on this vehicle and wished I hadn't. I never had a chance to use it. My vehicle has never seen the inside of a shop. I change the oil and perform the maintenance and keep on driving. 

If you need a dependable car with good feel, safety features, and &quot;sexy&quot; styling, buy an Oldsmobile Achieva SL V6.<br><br>
