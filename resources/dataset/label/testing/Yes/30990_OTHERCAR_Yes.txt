            There is no other car on the market that offers as much horsepower as the Firebird for as low a price.  It's sleek style and impressive power is reminiscent of the old 60's muscle cars, allowing its driver to feel the strength of 305 horses beneath it as he/she accelerates at a rate that puts other comparable models to shame.  

If that offer of freedom on wheels is not enough to lure you to your nearest dealer, remember that the age of the true sports car is ending and soon this car will be hard to find.  As our culture shifts to sluggish SUV's and minivans and Suburbans, our people no longer yearn for the liberation of traveling 150 miles per hour as those of us who still love the sound of a revved engine do.  

Even other sports car manufacturers are shifting their design to incorporate more sharp edges and Japanese styling, leaving their cars looking like some space-age wannabes.  For all those who long to feel the fire of pure horses and American power, there is no substitute for the Firebird.  

Its only disadvantage is size, with very little trunk or back seat room, but if your main concern is freedom and fun, extra room is obviously unnecessary.<br><br>
