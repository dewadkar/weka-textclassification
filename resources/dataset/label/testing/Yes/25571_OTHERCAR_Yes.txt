            Here is a car that if you believe the ads, should be driven only by by people with streamlined luggage, no pets, no kids and no snow in their forecast.  Not by someone like me, who keeps a shedding dog in the passenger seat, regularly stuffs the trunk, passenger seat area and back window well to capacity with gallons of milk, 16 packs of toilet paper and potting soil, and lives in snowy New England where I am frequently snowbound.  This sleek cat of a car, which is the envy of every teenage boy in our small town, is a chameleon.  

Gear Shift: Six months out of the year, I throw back the ridiculously easy to open top, and take every country road en route my destination just so I can spend a little more time shifting the buttery gears.  Even city driving is a dream because downshifting is just so darn fun, it makes me feel like I'm in an English motor rally.  And to tell you the truth, I feel like a total babe knowing how to handle this car.  I think all fast-car loving women should experience this...

Handling: Um, wow.  When was the last time you actually felt safe speeding up on an exit ramp?  It feels like the car is magnetized to the road.

Handling in snow, sand, gravel:  Granted, I bought the car with performance tires and haven't gotten snow tires because of the cost, but I've never met a car that's more finicky about its road surface.  Even pulling away from a light on a perfectly dry, but salt covered, road will cause the traction light to come on as the car jerks to regain its footing.  

Interior capacity: At 5'9", I've got legroom to spare. I 'm fairly sure no Bavarian engineer considered the maximum interior cargo toting capabilities of the Z3, but with the top back, my husband and I actually wedged a boxed Weber grill in between the seats to drive home from a mall once.  You do what ya gotta do.

Seats:  Between the soft leather and the seat warmers, winter driving is made more tolerable.  Fortunately, the sensor switches from High to Low just before you feel like you're going to ignite.  For the quality of the seat, however, lumbar support would've been nice.

Rear window:  Pilgrims had better visibility with their hand blown windows than this plastic one.  Backing out of parking spaces (with the top up) can be really hairy especially with the SUV moms that whale through the lots.

Noise:  Not a car for making business calls when going 70MPH.  At 35-40MPH, there is no noise.

Acceleration: I've had my Z3 for four years now and there are still times I look in the rear view mirror at cars behind me in disbelief that I just pulled away from them so fast.  It's really easy to floor it and not realize how fast you're throwing into fourth.  Sweet.

Safety: I had serious second thoughts when I drove off the lot after my purchase and got on the highway with tractor trailers and SUVs.  I became obsessed with the fact that the door handle of a Cadillac was over my head.  However, my trade in vehicle was, believe or not, a Suzuki Sidekick, which got sucked in towards big rigs as I passed.  Even with the top down, I still feel safer in the Z3. Knowing I can swerve faster than any of those SUV Leviathans and not lose control is worth the cash.  

If you own a Z3, you have to be realistic that in the event of a highway crash with big trucks, you're a human speed bump.  The headrest roll bar  on newer models is a nice touch, but I've seen two non-fatal crashes involving the Z3s and, frankly, it was only luck that saved the driver, not air bags or roll bars.
