            I recently upgraded from a SL to the new LS1 (standard transmission).  I am sold on Saturn--my experience with them has been great overall.  The no-haggle pricing system assures me that I am getting the same deal as everyone else, and the value for the money is great.
The car itself is larger and much more luxurious than the lower models (SL series), and I believe is comparable to the Camry, the Accord and the likes at a much nicer price.  Resale values on Saturns tend to be high, and the low service prices (compared to Japanese cars) make them worth a good look.  The standard transmission is superior to the automatic in that it feels more like a &quot;performance vehicle&quot; and makes it &quot;sportier&quot;.  The CD player has great sound, and little touches like the clips on the rear shoulder belts (to lower the belt for children) are nice touches.  
Overall, this car has been a joy to drive and commands a lot of respect for it's relative uniqueness (there aren't a ton of them on the road yet).  The trunk space is huge and holds a lot of gear, making this the ideal family car.  The only downside that I have yet to encounter is that there weren't a whole lot of color choices when I bought--certainly nothing out of the ordinary.  The plastic side panels have saved a few careless drivers a chunk of money.<br><br>
