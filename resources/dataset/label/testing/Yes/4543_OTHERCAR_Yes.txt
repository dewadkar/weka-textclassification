            I bought my Cherokee because I needed room for a family of 5 in a 4x4.  I was not too familiar with Cherokees when I bought it, but I was quickly impressed!

The Inline 6 cyl. 4.0 HO motor is awesome! It has all kinds of power on and off road.  This is one fast truck.  The &quot;Power&quot; setting for the transmission is where I always run it, as the shifting is more responsive, and tends to hold the gear longer (making getting up to speed a little faster).

I have lifted it 3&quot;, and run 31&quot; tires with nearly no rubbing at all.  Even with the bigger tires, I can turn on a dime!  The only problem with running bigger tires, is the speedometer reads less mph than what you are actually doing.  This is a quick and inexpensive fix though, a &quot;speedometer drive gear&quot; can be obtained from the stealership for around $20, and it is supposed to be a 20 - 30 minute job.

Cherokees are very capable off-road, especially if you remove the rear anti-sway bar (this is common practice), and install quick-disconnects on the front anti-sway bar.

One problem that Cherokees are known for (on this engine) is the rear main seal on the engine.  This is not a very complicated fix, though it takes a long time (took me so long that I have the entire underside of my rig memorized!).  It is worth it to do it yourself though, as it would be very expensive at a repair shop.

The paint jobs on these trucks are pretty much worthless, so they will either look bad, or require new paint.  Take good care of it from the start, and the problem will be minimized.  This brings up another point - with all the corners and cracks, waxing them is no picnic, but is essential to caring for the appearance.<br><br>
