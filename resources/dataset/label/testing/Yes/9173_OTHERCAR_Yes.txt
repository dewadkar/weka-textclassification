            2001 Toyota RAV4 The 2001 RAV4 is a 4-door, 5-passenger compact sport utility vehicle available in two
trims, the 4x2 and 4x4. 
Upon introduction, the 4x2 is equipped with a standard 2.0-liter, I4, 148-horsepower engine that consumes
24-mpg in the city and 28-mpg on the highway. The 4x4 is equipped with a standard 2.0-liter, I4,
148-horsepower engine that consumes 22-mpg in the city and 26-mpg on the highway. A 5-speed manual
transmission with overdrive is standard, while a 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission is
optional. 
The RAV4 has been redesigned for 2001. This vehicle is intiguing because it fight well in the SUV battle
for supremacy, but it is not as monstrous as other SUVs while coming at only 60 percent of the price tag. 
This is a great looking automobile, and reminds me more of the old GEO Trackers rather than SUVs.<br><br>
