            Over the past few months I've been investigating my opportunities to replace my aging Acura, and in the process I ran across a new Jeep Wrangler.  I had driven several Older model Jeeps in the past and had always come away wanting a little more civilization.  Before any Jeep Purists lynch me, I'm talking about the suspension.  I love the open top, wind in the hair, visceral appeal of the Wrangler, but I thought it needed a little better ride control.

When my fiance asked me to test drive a new Wrangler, I said &quot;why not!!&quot;  After a day with the Jeep, I am thoroughly impressed, the new coil-spring suspension ('97+) is a wonder when compared to the old leaf-spring setup.  The example I drove was a little disappointing in performance, it had the 6-cyl (the same one that smokes in my mom's Cherokee) but mated to a 3-speed automatic and a 3.07:1 rear end it was downright boring.  I would definitely recommend either the optional 3.76:1 gears or the manual transmission (or BOTH) for a little more pep.  The 4-cylinder models are pro-active in this area and come standard with 4.11:1 gearing with either transmission (a short jaunt in a 4-cyl 5-speed was MUCH peppier).  In matters of ecology, Jeep has certified the 4-cylinder version as a TLEV (transitional low emission vehicle), signaling their move toward more efficient and cleaner-burning motors in all of their vehicles.

In terms of refinement and creature comforts, the newer tops seal a lot better than the old ones, and the structure is a lot more solid.  My only gripe about this Jeep is that the price does seem a little high, but that is more a function of supply and demand than anything else, and long live the free market!  I also like a lot of the options that Jeep has made available such as a lockable &quot;trunk&quot; and the overhead soundbar.  

I would recommend this to anyone needing fun and rugged transportation in a midwest or northern climate, but everyone do yourself a favor, and order the hardtop!  One last note, if you are short, order the side-steps, that's a HIGH stepover.<br><br>
