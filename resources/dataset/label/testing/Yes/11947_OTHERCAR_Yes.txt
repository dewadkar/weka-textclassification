            <b>Introduction</b>
The Chevrolet S-10 is by far the nicest compact pickup to be had on the market today.  It will out tow, out run and out perform Ford Ranger in any arena you choose.

<b>Pros</b>
This truck is full of pros.

First of all is the engine, a 4.3 L V6.  The fuel injected, electronic ignition boasts 195 hp.  This is only achieved at a high redline, but you can still expect 180 usable horses.  This truck puts 245 foot lbs of torque to the ground.  It will spin the tires very easily, even with an automatic transmission.  It also has no problem towing heavy things.

The axle is rated at half a ton, and it will easily tow things that weigh 6,000 pounds.(Tested my me)

With the 5-speed manual transmission, this truck is capable of getting gas mileage nearing the 30 mile per gallon mark.  With an automatic transmission you may be closer to 20 mpg.

The interior is very comfortable, everything is laid out nicely.  Sitting in the front seat you could be comfortable for a long time.  With the extended cab, you can recline the seats and have a nice sleeping platform.

The bed has mounts so that you can put pieces of 2x4 across so you can have two areas to put things.  The tailgate is very easy to remove if you need to have things stick out.

The stock radio is pretty good.  You have controls over bass, treble, and alto, and several things in between.  The speakers thump really well for a stock stereo system.

The headlamps are pretty good, a new set has been implemented from years past that even look pretty good.

The four wheel drive is excellent in the snow for going, and the ABS is great for stopping.  While my friend has driven on lots of dirt roads with washboard, the ride is still dead quiet.

In my preference this is the most beautiful compact pickup you can buy, but that can be heavily disputed, its only my opinion.  The rims that you can choose are gorgeous, even the bottom of the line ones.

<b>Cons</b>
First of all, something that must be said for all Chevy's.  <b>The paint SUCKS</b>  This is no different in S-10's.  My friends '97 is already showing wear on the bumpers.

While a third door is offered, it deletes one of the rear seats.

The extended cab shouldn't be used to haul people, it is way too cramped.  This truck really only seats two comfortably, although four will fit.

The Vortec is kind of cramped into the engine bay, so working on it may be difficult.

<b>Choices</b> Gas mileage or power?

The S-10 and S-10 Blazer come with a choice of three rear end gearings.  They are summed up pretty well like this:

3.04 = 28 miles per gallon, 5,100 lbs. towing
3.42 = 24 miles per gallon, 5,600 lbs. towing
3.79 = 20 miles per gallon, 6,400 lbs. towing

When choosing yours, this is almost as important as the transmission if you are looking for towing or gas mileage.  The automatic is certified by Chevy to tow 500 lbs more than the manual.  While the manual will give you at least two miles per gallon in fuel economy.

<b>Overall</b>
If you are in the market for a compact pickup, there is no competition with S-10.

Whether you want power, fuel economy, price or utility.  This truck meets each with flying colors.<br><br>
