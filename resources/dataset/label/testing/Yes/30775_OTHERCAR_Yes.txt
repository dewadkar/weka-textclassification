            This was my first foray into the world of digital photography.  I had been looking at cameras for about 6 months before deciding on this particular model.  My primary motivating factor for the purchase was the price,
$299.95 at 6th Ave. Electronics.  I've since found it for less at several e-commerce sites, but I like the fact that I supported a local business with my purchase, not to mention the ease of returns should problems develop.
The ups for the camera are great photo quality, better than my friends expensive Sony cameras.  Most importantly, I'll never have to buy another roll of film.  I'm one of those people who have film laying all around the house with no idea of what it is and no desire to spend $10 to find out that it's photo's of something that I care nothing about, nor have any idea why I took them in the first place.
A few suggestions though; the camera does eat batteries, so invest in a charger (about $20. at Radio Shack with two nickle hydride batteries), and buy a spare set of batteries, use the nickle hydride rechargables, as they seem to last the longest, you'll need four for the camera, and they average about $5.00 each, less if you buy them in quantity. And, don't forget to get a spare set to carry with you in your camera bag.
Secondly, invest in the FlashPath Smart disk adapter for the media cards,(a spare media card, about $50.00 isn't a bad idea either) this can run anywhere from $79.95 complete with drivers to $99.95, it makes downloading the photos much easier.<br><br>
