            We were in unanimous agreement.  This car was awesome.  This car was &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; and we thought about tricking it out and then dancing all around it.  This car was amazingly different from all the others and affordable.  We decided that I needed to test drive one.  We also thought I needed to test drive the Toyota MR2 since that was also somewhat affordable.

&quot;WE&quot; were the students and I who took a week-long field trip to Washington DC.  On the plane, we were perusing a Consumer Reports car buyer's guide that I had highlighted and was going over.  I had also highlighted the BMW 3-series and 5-series but my students taunted me saying, &quot;You're a teacher, what are you thinking?&quot;  

I reminded them that I was single and didn't have a drain on my &quot;bank&quot; from things like drugs, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and um...well...KIDS!  We all laughed as I then told them the story of how I was able to finance my Toyota 4Runner.  They were right of course, I really couldn't afford a BMW, as I diabolically planned a ridiculously difficult quiz to give them when we got back to school.  (Oh, was that out loud?)

Anyway, it was April and I was getting frisky.  I love my Toyota 4Runner but my lease is up within the year and I wanted to get something uniquely different.  There were two cars that were both affordable and outstandingly stylish: The Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Toyota MR2 Spyder.  (Actually, the Pontiac Aztek is also unique and affordable, but it's U-G-L-Y it don't got no alibi.  It's ugly, Oooh Oooh, it's ugly!)

The (P)ersonal (T)ransportation Cruiser was first on my list.  I went to three separate Chrysler dealerships and the story was the same.  Instead of the sharks (dealers, Oh, I mean &quot;sales consultants&quot;) circling around me to price out my 4Runner thinking fresh meat, wholesale trade in, and dollar signs, they looked at me sadly, pointed over at the crowd of people and said, &quot;You're here to see the PT Cruiser, right?  Well, it's over there.&quot;  Then they went back to putting their hands on their chins with their elbows tucked between their knees as they sat.  I guess they were pouting like little children and weren't getting any commission off the cruisers. 

The signs posted up all around said the waiting list is 2-6 months and no cars were available for sale that day.  If you could get a sales consultant to stop pouting, and you asked about driving one, they just sort of giggled.  The cruisers had to stay on the showroom floor.  They would take deposits and &quot;freeze&quot; the price for you at full MSRP.

Well, at least there wasn't a mark-up.  I went on the internet and got the same response.  Although I called some dealers who were nice enough to tell me the real story and inside scoop.  2 months was a joke.  It was at least going to be 4 months, more likely six, and possibly even eight before you could get one.  The &quot;fleet manager&quot; at one dealership suggested that I rent one and even gave me the name and location of a rental company that would rent me a cruiser.  (Dollar Rent-a-Car, LAX)  Good idea I thought.  I had to chaperone my school's Prom that weekend and imagine the commotion at school and at the Prom if I pulled up in PT Cruiser...(BMW this!!!  Oooops, sorry, was that out loud too?)

So I rented one for the weekend and asked if I could use my Autoclub discount.  Again, they laughed.  I was directed to a red one on the lot and I had to catch my breath.  Oh my!  I had seen them and touched them at the dealership, but I was actually going to drive one!  This is such an attractive car.  The cars are available in black, silver, midnight blue, aquamarine, and deep cranberry pearl (purple).

It took a while for me to get used to the different instrumentation panel and power window controls, which were located centrally instead of on the doors.  I gunned the engine and found it a little bit lacking in power.  However, I figured that I really didn't want to go too fast in this car.  I wanted to be seen in this car.  The turning radius could have been better as well, but it was decently nimble.

I pulled up to IN-N-OUT and was instantly greeted with stares and jealous onlookers.  People motioned for me to roll down the window and I had to answer a whole bunch of questions about the car.  Could I just sit there and eat my double double animal?  NOPE.  I was a celebrity.  I had to answer all the questions with a smile or the tabloids would write unkind things about me.

Talking to people while driving or sitting at a stoplight became commonplace.  I also got assaulted by &quot;drive by honkers&quot; who gave me the thumbs up sign, kids who would stick half their bodies out the window and yell something, and all manners of nonverbal communication and hand signals, usually positive.

But my fame lasted only a weekend.  I returned the car on a Sunday and drove my 4Runner to the Chrysler dealership closest to my apartment.  I marveled at how my 4Runner handled better and had a spunkier engine.  Even then, I put a deposit down for a deep cranberry pearl Limited Edition 2001 PT Cruiser and got in line.  I wouldn't mind being a celebrity, although I could see how fame could get tiresome.

I'm still on the waiting list and anticipating the call from my dealership.  My guess is that I'll have my cruiser for Christmas.  That's okay, I have a few months left on my lease and maybe by then there will be enough of the cruisers delivered so I don't have to smile and be so nice to every curious george.  I guess in the meantime, I can look at &quot;after market&quot; accessories, play the Grease CD, and daydream.<br><br>
