            This is a nice little camera: pretty light weight and small.  It comes with 4 NiMH batteries, 4 regular AA batteries AND a NiMh charger!  It also came with a 8 meg compact flash card.  It came with the usual case and strap (I have a Minolta Big Finder AF35).  It has a lot of features on it from 1x, 1.4 and 2x zoom, several flash options and macro mode and a playback feature.  Also, has some special printing capabilities for high quality printing. You can also buy a remote control to take a photo.  O it also comes with a USB cable / software.  It can be hooked up to a TV/VCR.

I've had this camera about a week now.  The whites are too white, they &quot;glow&quot;.  Though you can change it to different settings, I haven't tried that yet.  It does an &quot;auto-detect&quot; on the whites.  The LCD screen isn't too visible in sunlight even though you can increase / decrease the briteness.  You can set the quality for each photo.  The batteries go quick in about 3 hours of pretty heavy usage.    Apparently this &quot;problem&quot; has not been solved yet like the Dimage V.

The downloads to the PC seem to be pretty painless, just make sure the camera is on and software loaded.  The quality seems to be pretty good with each one, file size is around 300k each.
