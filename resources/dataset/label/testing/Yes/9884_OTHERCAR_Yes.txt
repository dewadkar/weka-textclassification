            So I needed a new vehicle...  I had my eye on a pick-up truck for a while, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Here's what I got...

The 1998 Dodge Dakota, 4x2, 4 cyl engine, 5 spd manual trans, regular cab, 6 ft bed.

$12,500 out the door.  I was happy with the price.  I was initially attracted by the styling and the reputation of the New Dodge trucks and I haven't been disappointed!

The Dakota is a nice truck.  The ride is good, handling is great.  I liked it better than the Toyota Tacoma.  It's my daily commuting vehicle and it's very comfortable for that.  It's bigger than most compact pickup trucks and it rides a bit higher.  The 4 cylinder engine is adequate, but it really doesn't zip like the V-6.  If I were to get another one, I'd get at least the V-6.  But if you just need a nice truck to drive around, the 4 with do you fine.  I can only imagine what the V-8 in the R/T version would be like!

The gas mileage is okay, about 18-20 mph on mostly highway miles.  The gas tank seems a little too small though.  I think I have a 15 gallon tank and it seems like I have to get gas every other day!  (with my 75 mile round-trip daily commute...)

The instrument panel is okay, but for some reason in my truck I have a huge fuel gauge, where I would much rather have a tachometer.  It's got this weird little shift indicator light, but I don't drive like that and usually just ignore it.  The gauges are all clean and easy to read.

The standard AM/FM cassette system is decent.  For the small enclosure of the truck's cab, it sounds great.  So far I've only got the stock stuff, so I can't give any more details, but I've seen some really nice custom Dodge trucks around.

The AC is really good.  It gets cold really fast and I usually have to bring up the temp a little after a while so I don't freeze.

Overall, buying this truck has been a great investment deal for me.  I think the bigger engines and a club cab would be better for the way I like to use my truck, but the quality and the looks of this truck are hard to match.<br><br>
