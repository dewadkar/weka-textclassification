               I've been an owner of a 5 speed manual transmission 1991 Eagle Talon for about 2 years now and I can positively say that this is the best car I've ever owned.The Talon comes equipped with a 2.0 litre,DOHC(Dual OverHead Cams)engine which,while on the small side,does provide some fairly quick acceleration.Handling,however is what the Talon excels at providing the driver with the ability to accelerate through tight turns with ease.The front bucket seats are very comfortable and adjustable and also provide plenty of room.Although the back seats are nearly as comfortable as the front,because of the car's swooping design,adults will find them extremely cramped.The cars body design is also a selling point;the smooth lines and distinct hump in the hood make this car hard to ignore when it's out on the road.My Talon has over 150,000 miles on it and the engine runs like new(with only minimal repairs) and the body has no rust,so it seems to be quite durable,especially for a 4 cylinder!If you're looking for a fast car,you may want to look elsewhere,but if you're looking for a dependable car with a sports car look and feel,you'd be hard pressed to top the Talon.<br><br>
