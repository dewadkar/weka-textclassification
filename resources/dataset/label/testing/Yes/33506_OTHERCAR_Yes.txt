            Considering how cheap and how flexible this camera is, the quality you get is excellent. There are annoying things about it, but even so, it's great, I use it a lot and I'm happy I got it. 

You can put a 128M card in this camera for another $50, and you will _never_ run out of room. With 128M you can take endless "hi-res" pictures and hours of video. The only limitation is batteries, which the camera chews through like candy. Consider buying rechargeable AAA's. 

I don't care that much, but still images look mediocre (also, there's trouble with tough lighting, movement, etc) - but this isn't a $300 Kodak, so what did you expect?  :) The quality is acceptable for the price.

The big disappointment is the camera's "carry around" interface. It's just needlessly stupid.

It takes 10 seconds for this camera to turn on, and it turns itself off after 2 minutes of idling NO MATTER WHAT. Add to that the additional time it takes to adjust the camera's settings (video/pictures, resolution, and its ever annoying "sounds" option), which are usually NOT SAVED when you turn it off, and you have completely lost the ability to take "spontaneous" pictures or video. Add to this the slow-reacting and often-"lost" button presses, and you have a recipe for annoyance, and a camera that might confuse and surprise non-savvy users.

It makes a loud beep when it turns on or off, and there's a loud shutter sound when you take a picture. Thereï¿½s a "sound" option to turn that off, which doesn't actually turn off the shutter noise, just makes it slightly quieter. This is intensely annoying, especially if less noise is one reason you wanted a digital. One day I'm going to open this sucker up and rip out that little speaker myself.

The video really is great and you can have a lot of fun with it. But another huge annoyance - you have to hold down the button the entire time you want to record. Just dumb. And don't miss the subtle fine print like I did; no matter how big a memory card you have, you will never get more than 90 seconds of video at a time, with 10-20 seconds in between for the camera to get ready again.
