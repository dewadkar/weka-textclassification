                   -In 1991 I bought a Mazda B-2600 brand new, because I wanted a durable and reliable 4 wheel drive truck. Since then it has been on countless hunting/fishing/camping trips from Colorado to Montana. This truck has been hit by lightning twice (on Pike's Peak in Colorado), forced to go over snow-filled mountain passes, and even washed away in floods. I am currently interested in buying a new truck - because of interior room and comfort - but would like to know if the new Mazda trucks can stand up to this type of punishment. Also - why is it that this particular truck only has towing braces in the front - so that when ever I have to tow another vehicle I have to tie the strap around the rear axle??<br><br>
