            If you're looking for a vehicle that will take you into the mud, snow, grass, and dirt and back the Jeep Wrangler is your answer.  If you want a hobby car to put big tires, a suspension lift, lightbars, roof racks, and anything else imaginable on, then the Wrangler is for you.  But believe me when I tell you it is NOT a vehicle that you should drive to work and back every week or drop off and pick up the kids from school on a daily basis.  If you already own a vehicle made to drive that much and you have plenty of money to put into another vehicle, then buy a Wrangler.  

Unfortuntely I made the mistake of making the Jeep Wranlger my only driving vehicle and since I bought it two years ago I have replaced the clutch, the hydraulic clutch pedal, 1st and 5th gears, the exhaust manifold, the muffler, the starter, the alternator, the radiator, the soft top and windows, and the battery.  All of this wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact the Jeep parts are more expensive than most automotive parts and only half of the mechanics in my city could even work on a Jeep.  A Jeep Wrangler's body is very small and compact and, naturally, the engine is kind of smooshed into a small cube of space which makes for a difficult time doing even the simple things like changing the oil.

I have to say though, taking it out in the summer is great!  Just spend about ten minutes taking down the soft top, doors, and windows, pack up your lunch, buckle in your sweetheart and ride.  (Hard-top owners will have to make a project out of taking the top off.)  And don't expect to go very fast.  Taking half the body off cuts your Jeep's top speed down about 35%.  Speaking of power, the Jeep's top speed on level ground with factory tires, wheels, and suspension and the top, doors, and windows all on is usually not more than 80mph.  I added a 3" body lift, 31" tires, and 10" wheels and now I'm lucky if I can hit 80mph going down hill on the interstate.  The Wrangler's 2.5L to 4.0L engines are not very powerful.  Also, expect to have to yell to your passengers while driving down the road, especially on highways and interstates (this only applies to soft-top owners) because the wind resistance against the top makes a fairly loud roaring noice.  Not to mention the occasional leaking when it rains.

A Jeep Wrangler is a great vehicle for off-roaders and hobbiests alike.  But expect to put a lot of money into your investment.  This is definitely not a vehicle to put a lot of miles on.  I've had some serious mechanical problems since I've had it and it's only been two years!  Be careful when making your purchase decision.  Trust me, if you don't have the money and the time, the Jeep Wrangler is not going to be your best choice.
