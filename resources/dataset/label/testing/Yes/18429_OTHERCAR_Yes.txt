            I purchased a used 1997 Corolla CE ( it seems Toyota only offered 2 models in 1997, this one and the DX, which comes standard with the larger 1.8 liter engine ) because I was replacing a leased Maxima. I was actually looking for a Honda Civic, but they are so outragously priced where I live, that I thought I'd take a look a Corollas. 

I found a fantastic deal on it from a family owned used car dealer which has some kind of deal with the local CarMax. It seems that if Carmax won't sell a car within 120 days, they offload them to local smaller dealers at a huge discount. 

I found the ride quite satisfactory. The car came with Lots of options for a CE...Power Windows..power locks..remote keyless entry..remote starter, and it even had brand new tires; Cooper II Classic..which if you know your tires is an excellent tire for a compact car. The car had all the basics...Auto, Air, Stereo, dual air bags, 4 door ( the back seat is too small for adults really, but the 4 doors make it a bit safer in case of collision ).

The car only had 35,000 miles on it, which really caught my eye..and the price was right..the original "CarMax" price was still on the Dealer sticker in the window $7200..but the dealer was asking $5995..and I got them down to $5500. I ran a Carfax report to check the title, mileage, and history..and found no problem. I was soon the  1st time owner of a Corolla, which is a bit strange to be since I've always, and still am, a Honda fan. 

About a week after I got the car, i noticed some small dings on the hood and on the roof..and soon realized that this was probably caused by a hail storm..but I'm not bitter, since I got a great deal on the car, and you can barely notice them. This car has the 1.6 Liter engine. Though I would have preferred the 1.8 liter, this is fine since it will mainly be a local commuter car and not alot of hightway driving. 

I was a bit disappointed while test driving the car that it only has the 3 speed automatic, and which I noted to the dealer, but it really didn't matter to me and actually is better for commuter driving because each gear has a larger speed range.

I was considering getting a manual, but after considering the type of traffic I drive in everyday ( LOTS of stop and go ), the auto made more sense. All in all its a solid car for a single commuter like myself. Another small defect which I found before I took delivery of the car was that the gas cap door wouldn't spring open after pulling on the release in the cab. The dealer kind of cludged it with a piece of foam rubber so it would work. I wonder if this is a common problem in this model year.
