            I tell ya, Canon makes me very happy with the new PowerShot G2, a camera that not only betters the previous model but manages to exceed any expectations for a new model. With its 4.1-megapixel CCD and a 2,272x1,704-pixel image at the largest resolution, this digital camera's offerings will surely impress you.

A cool improvement on the G2 is a three-point autofocus system. Instead of being locked into one singular point of focus, you can create perfectly focused images no matter where your subject is positioned in the frame. Just align one of the three white boxes in the viewfinder with your subject, use the thumb dial to choose the right box, and press the shutter button halfway to focus. You can also select up to 13 different exposure modes using the rotary dial on top of the camera. The Image Zone modes are fully automatic and should be selected based on the scene you are shooting. There is also a new Color Effect, which allows users to choose between Neutral, Vivid, Black and White, or Sepia. It doesn't stop there, however, since the camera features yet another feature: you can get even more control using the Creative Zone by choosing from Shutter-priority, Aperture-priority, Program AE, and Manual. The Movie mode has been improved as well, now offering two separate resolution modes that include sound.


If you're somewhat of a fashion/aesthetics type person, you'll be pleased just the same. The most obvious change is the color, which has gone from gray to a warm champagne color with metallic accents. Although it's almost entirely identical to the G1 when it comes to looks, it feels and handles so much easier, you'll be surprised. The controls and dials are positioned so well that you'll rarely need to take your finger off the shutter, so you can always be ready to preserve that Kodak moment.

Just like the G1 and the Pro70 before it, the G2 has a cool  flip-out-and-twist LCD monitor. When not in use, the display can be inverted and folded back against the rear of the camera, protecting the monitor from bumps and scrapes. You can take all sorts of shots by raising the camera high above your head or keeping it low without even having to bend down because of the movable display (It rotates up and down). The LCD screen itself is quite realistic, revealing clear, crisp previews that are not as messed up as the ones on the G1's LCD monitor and other cameras'. However, there is a down side since there is a bit of a delay when you focus with the LCD instead of the viewfinder.

I can tell you for certain that the G2 has the best image quality on the market today. The shot are always clear, perfect, crisp, sharp, exactly how you want them, and most importantly, saturated enough in color. You'll get perfect shots even in low-light places.

With the $999 list price the G2 definitely has the more advanced photographer in mind, but amateurs and first-time digicam users should not be scared away. As far as I know, the lowest price on it in stores right now is $748, on the web, however, you can certainly get it for much less. If you have read any of my other reviews, you'd know that i am concerned with affordability as much as I am with quality, maybe even more, and I say that for the lowest list price of $748 it's a great deal, but for $900 its just as good. Compared to some of the other digital cameras in the same class, such as the Nikon Coolpix 995 , the G2's interface is pretty much better. This camera's higher resolution, better image quality, and faster signal processing are all well worth the price and make it a better buy than anything else out there.

As much as i like Canons and as much as I praise them, I can't rate them on a very high durability scale. Everything i own that is a Canon I don't expect to work more than 2-3 years, especially if I use it a lot.
