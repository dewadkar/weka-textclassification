            Okay then - The CRX: not a person out there who doesn't find it cute, not an owner who doesn't appreciate its virtues. It is damn small yet can carry volumes of crap.  It starts every day and gets great gas mileage. A sunroof makes it perfect. The Si handles really well for a front-wheel-drive  car.  The plain CRX is fine yet has no rear wiper and probably won't have the sunroof. The CRX HF is slow... basic... and transportation - though it can get upwards of 50 mpg.

Here are a few things you might like to know if you're considering purchasing any CRX.

1: Size: both good and bad.
         You can make wonderfully tight u-turns. You can fit in any parking spot - I live in a crowded Brooklyn neighborhood where alternate side parking rules the lives of every car owner. Without fail, i can get the car in a spot with 3 inches to spare on each side - and I've gotten good at parking.
          However, it gets the living daylights beat out of it daily - even when you're not driving it. Most SUV bumpers slide OVER mine, causing tons of nasty scratches and dings as far back as the hood.  

2: Little cars take a beating
         You should glance at the CV boots (small rubber cone-shaped things around the front axles) - touch them for greasiness - look on the inner fender well for a line of sprayed grease. Grease anywhere outside of A CV boot means it needs to be replaced.
         You should feel the clutch for wear as best you can - I was a tad clueless having only driven my dad's Peugeot 505 wagon, a Taurus with a stick (I know, how rare and unique - whatever, it was quite worn out) and my 63 Mercury Comet with one heck of a heavy clutch. I had no clue what almost soft/almost gonPX3llt like in a Japanese car. Now I wish I had known. My clutch is really really really annoying in stop-and-go traffic. But it's $300 to replace. So I deal, and stall in traffic and while parking.
         You will also have to accept the $300 that goes to water pump/timing belt/all the belts servicing at 63-65k. It all adds up.           
        Some things you should be careful of while we're on the topic: Broken glass: look in the trunk UNDER THE SPARE. Accident? Broken into? Then while you're in the trunk - look at the plastic all around the trunk area - something doesn't pop back in if you try? Accident. 
         This car is not worth buying if it's been in an accident - most definitely you'll have strange problems - mostly due to the fact that the frame's no longer straight. Also look in the secret 007 compartments behind the seats. You can find glass there too. Push the seats all the way forward, glass can be on the carpet too. Don't buy this car if it has ever been in an accident. Ask to see the receipt for the glass replacement if it was "just a break-in."

3: Two seats.
Oh yeah this is good: you didn't buy this car for other people, you bought it for yourself. You're only young once. But if you're stuck giving a ride after a date that went poorly, you're awfully close.  And if you're stuck on a long drive with someone you can only sortof deal with, you'll hate that person really quickly.  Select your co-pilot carefully.
   Okay, this isn't a good reason not to buy this car. But when a group of you want to go somewhere, you'd better have friends under 5'2" if they plan to sit in the back. I don't suggest you do this if you have a choice.  If you get in an accident, their intertia will slam into the back of your seat and blow out your neck or send you flying into the windshield. Though if you're in an accident in this car, you really don't have a chance in hell anyway.

4: I wish I could scan the back of my right sneaker and show it to you. 
     I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem, but on trips over two/three hours, the fact that the driver sits on the floor places the heel of one's foot in a very strange position - totally horizontal - the BACK of your heel rests on the floor. 
     I find my heel hurts a good amount and makes driving unpleasant. I've tried taking off the sneaker, putting a pad underneath my heel - to no success.  I'm serious. You don't notice it at first.

Specific issues to think about when purchasing an Si:

1: What kind of person would have bought this car originally? 
         You, essentially (okay, but give this thought a chance).  If you're interested in going fast and enjoying every turn you take - this is absolutely the car for you. But would you buy a car from yourself? Maybe, but not after you've experienced this car. 
          The engine hums in second, third, and fourth gear like a little devil on your shoulder, always wispering in your ear: "You can go faster than this." You can chose to listen or ignore - but speed is tempting when so readily available.  This car can turn you into a ferocious driver, and can get you killed if you're not too experienced.
           For this reason, you can guarantee the car has had the living daylights driven out of it. That means you, as the second or even third owner, will face a good amount of repairs initially. Yeah, all used cars need repair, I know. That said, it's a Honda - the transmission and engine are unbreakable. Still, the Si- because it sits so low to the ground - has received a beating even if it was treated correctly and maintained properly.  

2: The little teenagers like two letters: Si
          This car is popular, like all Hondas, with skinny little teenagers. Without fail, they're skinny and they're short. Maybe it's just in NYC, maybe it's just Queens.  They view the car as a drop-the-clutch-lower-till-the-tires-rub-huge-stereo-adrenaline-fest, and they might just need your car for parts. Maybe it'll get stolen to sell for parts to those kids - who knows. 
         There is a chance that if you see a CRX Si at a used car dealer that it was raced, flogged, or modified and put back to original look for resale. Be careful. Yeah, its 'only' $3000.
Take the CRX Si in ANY color if you buy it from the original owner who's got full documentation/records - only if you have a mechanic you REALLY trust check it out. And while he's got it up on the lift, spin the tires. No, I'm serious. A car that goes this fast has to stop. If the wheels don't spin TOTALLY smoothly and come to a nice... gradual... stop... you've got warped rotors (rotors are the 'disk' in disk brakes).  The brakes have been run hard: they've heated up repeatedly through HARD use and while cooling down, warped.  They'll say, "you can get them resurfaced" but in all likelihood that's been done before and you'll need to get them replaced - unless the seller has documented proof of the rotors and pads being replaced under 2000miles ago - then resurfacing isn't the worst thing in the world.
The problem with warped rotors is that they rub the brake pads while you're driving even when your foot is nowhere near the brake pedal. This eats through pads quicker than you'd like, and creates REALLY ANNOYING vibration in the steering wheel.  Get the seller to bring down the price for this repair or walk away.  
I'm being totally serious. Let me put it this way - if the car is GREAT! but the rotors are warped, you just received a little message from the car.  Quietly, it's saying, "You have no idea what else needs to be repaired in the next 300 miles - this owner beat me to sh-t.  Warped rotors? Think about a worn clutch, bushings, wheel bearings that need to be repacked..." While you're thinking about the cost involved in those repairs, get the seller to drop the asking price by at least $300 - 4 rotors, 8 pads + labor + you want to get the price down.
           Another thing to check for while the car is up on the lift:  when you spin the wheels, look for a worn patch or multiple smooth patches on the tire tread. If there's a few, you could have an allignment problem, but test it out when you drive the car.  While you're driving, let go of the steering wheel. Does the car pull in one direction? Now, hands still off the wheel (but close to it) - slam on the brakes. REALLY SLAM on them and then grab the steering wheel. Feel any pull? Yeah, repair. Bring down the cost some more. 
I looked at the tire tread and found that one tire had a LARGE worn section - but it wasn't the allignment - it was the rim. The rims on the Sis are Aluminium, and if bent NEED TO BE REPLACED. They CANNOT be bent back into shape cheaply, and for less you can get a replacement rim. 
           The price range varries on exact replacement rims. Call as many places as you can. I eventually found one in Florida. They resurfaced and painted it to a new quality finish. Beautiful, and it ran me about $100. Garage sales and classified ads will get you four for the same price, but then you've got four, and in all likelihood they'll be all scratched up.  My old bent rim is now the base of a coffee table.



      Well, I hope my various ramblings on owning and buying the CRX, Si or not, have helped you some. All cars should respond and involve the driver like the CRX Si- if you buy one you won't be looking to get any other car any time soon.   There is no car at this price that can comfortably cruise at 95, and then zip up to 115 to pass.  
      You might consider a normal Civic Si hatchback or the 4wd "Real Time 4wd" wagon, they go pretty much just as fast but didn't attract the exact same buying public when they first were sold because they look like normal Civics. The wagon is hard to find though, and slower because the same engine powers 4 wheels instead of 2.

Good luck!

Oh, one last thing. Shifts feel a little too notchy? Have trouble getting into reverse without grinding the gears? Put it into 1st, then go into reverse. Can't get into 1st? Put it into 3rd or 2nd, then it'll slide right into reverse or 1st. AND, the lubricator in the CRX manual tranny is motor oil, so replace it with synthetic oil, and your sticky shifter problems might just go away...
