            I own a 1991 Nissan Pathfinder SE-V6!  This truck is one the most powerful vehicles I've ever owned.  It's tough on all terrains.  It's safe and reliable in all conditions.  My 1991 Pathfinder has 100,000 miles on it and is still in the same condition it was when it was first bought.  Nissan Pathfinders are a nice size for any family.  There is enough space for luggage, kids, your pet and any extras.  Also on my Pathfinder we installed bike racks to the top of the roof, it adds a little utility to it!  In conclusion, if your looking for a truck that runs well in all conditions and is safe and reliable on the road and for yourself buy a Nissan Pathfinder..you won't be disappointed!!!!<br><br>
