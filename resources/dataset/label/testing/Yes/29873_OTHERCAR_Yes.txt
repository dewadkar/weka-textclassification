            While not an avid Kodak fan (anyone remember 110 film? Disk cameras?), every once in awhile I've got to hand it to them. And this time I handed them $729 for their very fine camera, the DC265.

It was actually my Mom's DC-120 lead me to take a look at this camera. The DC-120, and the DC265, have very, very good color control. We have an infant, and the camera catches that golden glow in her hair, the pink cheeks... you get the idea. Combined with an HP R40 multifunction (get it!), I can make photo's that really bring the kid to life. It's the color quality that really sets this camera apart from most of the rest. 

Too many digital cameras (notably the Mavicas) have problems with flat colors, overly compressed or poorly mapped or something. Kodak's digital color scientists have been doing their homework, and it shows.

What else is there to like? The USB interface is wonderful. I routinely load up the camera (30 pictures, 0.5MB each) and dump them quickly and easily through my computer to my ZIP drive. MUCH nicer than serial port interfaces! 

What's not to like? The camera is (ouch) complex... as is my Mom's DC120. Lot's of little intuitive buttons that take fooling around with to figure out. But most people can hack it, I think... Also, the resolution isn't adequate for really great scenery shots. Fine for snapshots, just not enough to do a detailed Grand Canyon shot. You need 4 megapixels or so for that work.

I just wonder why I didn't buy the DC290? Maybe I need a bigger hard disk, and the DC265's resolution better fit my computer.
