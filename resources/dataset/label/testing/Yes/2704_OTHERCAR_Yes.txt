            This is by far the best truck I've ever driven.  Spacious and comfortable, this pick-up handles with the ease of a car, but still has the power and utility of a truck.  My nephews have claimed the &quot;back-seat&quot; of our extended-cab T-100 as their personal domain, and have traveled with us on many camping trips, our gear stored in the bed.  It has the feel of a full-sized truck, and the V-6 engine has the power to GO when you want/need it to.  Mine is a 5 speed--the only one on the lot when I bought it, and I chose it because I wanted the response and control of manual transmission, and I knew I wouldn't be doing much, if any, towing.  In five years of ownership, with regular oil changes (3000 miles) and maintenance, I have only had it in the shop once, for a clutch bracket that cost $250 ($150 of which was parts).  If you require the carrying and towing capacity of a truck and desire the comfort and handling of a car--this is your dream.  A perfect &quot;city truck&quot;.<br><br>
