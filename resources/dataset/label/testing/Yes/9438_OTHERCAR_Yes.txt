            I just bought this 1994 Jetta 6 months ago for my first car.  It had 89000 miles on it and I bought it for 5200.  I couldn't be more happier with its looks and its comfyness.  The dealership put in new rear brakes and an exhaust system so I figured everything else would be all set.  Turns out I had to have all this engine work done after we bought it because the dealership put in a "fisher price" system.  It was alright though, I spent a lot more money that I had wanted but I figured it was all fixed and now the car will run great.

The sunroof broke.  I tried to open it and it got stuck, had to replace a $500 part.  Turns out most all the sunroofs in this type of car are faulty.  The check engine sign flashed on and off constantly.  All This work was done to it, and it still was acting up.  It is a great car, but not very dependable.  When the car is idle, it chugs along, and sometimes when I turn it off and get out I can smell exhaust (way too much).  I know that I probably deserve this because It is 94, with 2 previous owners and 89000 miles on it, and I get what I get, but c'mon.  I haven�t even had this car for long at all, and I've almost doubled what I spent on the car in repairs to belts, transmission and exhaust systems.

After all that work to the exhaust system, the muffler rattled and rattled like it was just going to fall right off.  Had to get that fixed as well.  The transmission pulls a lot and the rear wheels have failed for a couple seconds and then all of a sudden start going fast, jerking you around. 


Don't think I'm bad mouthing this car because I hate it and stuff.  I still own it and I will probably for a while, I'm a student.  I need a car.  Its a cool car.  The front seats are comfy (I�m not too sure about the rear seats, I've never sat in them).  I have heard the back has average room for people sitting there which is cool.  The car is a small sporty looking thing, so what do you expect.. tons of leg room? 

 The cup holders are horrible.  I'm a cup holder person.. I think they are essential.  The Jettas cup holders are right by the shift, so if the car is in park, you can't have a cup in it, and you can barely squeeze a regular cup into one even if the shift isn�t near it.  A quick fix for this is to just rest the cup in between the seat and the emergency brake... works good trust me.


I'm going to put a CD player in the car, but for right now the VW radio works just fine. It has a 14 gallon gas tank, so it normally costs around 20 to fill it, give or take a few dollars. It burns gas at a average rate I guess, sometimes it seems to go very very quickly however!

I haven�t had any electrical problems like other people are talking about yet (knock on wood). And I am overall pleased with this car.
