            I have been driving and sitting in the 1998 Toyota Avalon for two years now and the car feels like it's still brand new.  The engine on this car is phenomenal.  I have enjoyed the great take off, ride, and speed of the engine of this car.  I have put on almost 80,000 miles in two years, and my Avalon has never once even showed signs of wear.  I believe you get the price and quality of a Toyota, with the comfort and ride of a Lexus.  The seating is exquisite, even when you're sleeping (jk), and the leg room is just right.  The A/C is my antarctica in the midst of the florida heat wave, and all the other features just pamper the hell out of me.  As you can tell I love this car.  It is reliable, and safe.  This car is a great buy, with great style.  Enjoy it, buy it, and live the experience for years to come.<br><br>
