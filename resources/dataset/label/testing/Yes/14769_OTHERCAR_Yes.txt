            This is one solid vehicle. I bought mine used. It is a 1997 model, with a V8 engine, and All-Wheel Drive. I can pull my boat, which weighs almost 3500 pounds, with ease. I pulled it from Tennessee, to Myrtle Beach, SC, which is 500 miles. 90 MPH the whole way with no problems. 

It also does a decent job off-road. It doesn't have the greatest ground clearance, or a low range, but other than that, it does fine. 

The gas mileage isn't terrific. I get about 13 in every day driving. 

Overall, it is an extremely comfortable car, that has plenty of power, but isn't so large, that you have a hard time parking.
