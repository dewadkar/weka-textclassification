            We have owned our Saturn since 1992, and LOVE IT!!  We waited for it to come from the factory, and have been crazy about it ever since.  It's the absolute best buy for the money.  I love the safety features for the kids, and it gets great gas milage.  My husband is Military so we travel ALOT, it's been across the states and back a few times...and the only thing we've replaced is tires, breaks and a water pump.  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!  We are keeping this one for the kids to drive, no sleepless nites for us!!!!<br><br>
