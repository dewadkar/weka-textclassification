            My introduction to Volkswagens was my girlfriends 1981 Rabbit that was handed down to her from her brother.  Almost nothing worked on that car except the engine.  It had over 220,000 miles on it when we sold it.  The car had only minor engine problems that I was able to fix easily.  Her next car was an 1987 Jetta GLI.  Not the best car in the world due to the previous owner treating it like a race car, but still enjoyable to drive.  The most expensive fix was the A/C compressor hose.  The engine has 180,000 miles on it and is still very strong.  

Two weeks ago we just bought a 1994 Golf.  I love it.  It is solid, handles well and has plenty of pep.  The a/c hadn't been used for three years, but it only needed a couple of pounds of refrigerant and the cool air started flowing.  There is plenty of leg room in both the front and back seats.  The seats themselves are very comfortable.  The interior is roomy and comfortable like a mid-size sedan and the ride is very quiet.  The car has 55,000 miles on it and is almost due for it's 60,000 service which will cost, at most, $600.00.  The only thing I would change on this car is to have the rear seat be a 60/40 split so that three people could ride in the car and still be able haul gear such as golf clubs or snowboards.  I have become a loyal fan of Volkswagens.  <br><br>
