            This is one fine automobile. It is only a V4, but it has a suprisingly good amount of pickup. It's a little cramped in the back, but then again.. it's no luxury car. The gas mileage is excellent. It gets in the uppers 20's per gallon. We change the oil regularly, and have had no engine troubles yet. It started making a strange noise about 6 months ago, but it stopped on it's own... so i'm not sure what that was. Overall, a great buy for the value. It has many options available and if you are looking for a car in this price range, i reccommend you check this one out.<br><br>
