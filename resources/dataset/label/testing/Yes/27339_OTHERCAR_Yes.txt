            If you have kids and are considering a Mini-Van you may want to think twice about it and take a look at a Durango. It is more roomy then you think. It has two rows of seating in the back. Bigger kids may not care for the third row for comfortable seating, but it is ideal for smaller children. 

The Durango provides performance, comfort and classy looks of SUV but with a cheaper price tag. It's comfortable ride, leather interior and wood grain dash makes it feel like you are driving a car.

The seats fold away nicely to get access to the third row or to provide more storage space. I had a Dodge Caravan prior to this and although it much smaller in storage, my wife is much happier driving it then beeing seen in a Mini-Van. The strength and Power of the V8 engine also makes you feel much safer. 

So far I have not ran into a Durango owner that didn't say &quot;I love this truck&quot;

Definately check it out.<br><br>
