            Lets face it, you see more Civics around than anything else these days.  There has to be a good reason for that, so many people cant be stupid.  The Civic should be more of a younger persons car.  Its affordable, very fuel efficient, and looks good.  Also for those kids with a bigger bank account (or rich parents) its after market parts and modifications are countless.  You can take one of the basic DX models with a standard 116 horses and with some money and time you can get that little car crankin at 440 plus.  Speed down the road, blastin past anything that dares get in your lane.  

Civics come in 2dr, 3dr, and 4dr.  The 2 door coupe comes in DX, HX, LX, or EX versions.  3dr comes in the CX and DX and the 4dr comes in DX, LX, and the EX.  DX is the standard stripped version while LX adds small things like power doors and windows as well as AC and cruise control.  The EX mostly come with rear spoilers, moonroofs and all the little gadgets and gizmos that make it seem more like a luxury sedan.  

With a starting price of right around 13,000 for a DX 2dr.  Every kid with a job can afford one.<br><br>
