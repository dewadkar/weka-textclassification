            When I started my new job just after graduating college, I decided that I needed a new car to go with it.  Knowing that money was definitely a limiting factor, I decided to look for the less pricey alternatives to the Honda Accord I wanted.  
	After lots of research on the internet, and a few recommendations by a fiend, I has settled on a Hyundai Accent.  It was a 4 door sedan, was available in an automatic, and was approximately 10K even with air conditioner.  
	When I went to the dealer, they were very nice, assured me that it was in fact true that I could get a new car from them that was perfect for me and all under 10K.  They also let me know one other detail that my research did not uncover.  You see, Hyundai has the best warrantee that currently exists on the market.  My car is under warrantee completely for 5 years or 50000 miles, and then for 10 years or 10000 miles the engine and transmission are also under warrantee.
	This was something I definitely liked, as I knew that cars need maintenance, and the costs of that were worrying me.  I didn�t need to worry though.  While my car has needed some things done to it over the time that I owned it, I have not paid a cent for it.   
	There is of course a drawback to the wonderful warrantee.  It is only applicable in certified hyundai dealerships, so you can�t take the car to your favorite mechanic.  On the other hand though, the dealerships are friendly and helpful and have descent mechanics (except for the one in Norwood, never go there), so you do not have that much of an inconvenience.
	All in all, the 99 Accent is a great car.<br><br>
