            The Honda Passport is a really good car.  I have a 1997 model, and it has yet to fail me in action.  It has a lot of room, I use my trunk as a kind of shelter with blankets and pillows.....if you catch my drift.  It drives well, not quite like a car, but not quite like a truck either.  The only complaint I have about it is that the defroster leaves something to be desired.  It works okay on full blast, but otherwise, you're lucky if you can see anything out of the car.  The Four Wheel drive system is good, I've used it a lot, and it has worked perfectly everytime.  It is a good car especially if you live in a place where you will need four wheel drive, and a real deal stylin ride.<br><br>
