            I got this camera from casio website. It came with IBM microdrive for 340 mb. That means that on the best quality, which is about 1600x1200 I can store at least 340 pictures. Uploading is very easy, the only drawback I found so far was using disposable or rechargeable batteries. 

The price for the camera came down a little bit, but not too much. Also, casio website was pretty much the only place in the beginning of the year that offered that large storage.  I traveled outside the country to a wedding and was so so happy that I could fit more than 400 pictures (some were taken at lower resolution) without going to many troubles of finding a computer to upload them.

My camera really dislikes the rechargeable ones. They worked initially but then the camera would act as if the batteries are not really charged. I switched to disposable, but they do not last more than 2 hours of continuous use for me. I also use the LCD display occasionally (and so the power drains fast). I have to use the display when shooting objects at close range (Macro option). I then go to the display and check if the pictures came out all right.  

The camera is not too heavy, and portable enough to be taken anywhere.  The are a few drawbacks. My microdrive sometimes gave me messages that the shot I took did not come out, and I needed to reformat the drive. That is solved by opening and closing the camera. Flash, no flash, red-eye, movie (up to 30 seconds with the large memory I have), comes out great. I did panoramic shots - they were the easiest thing I've ever done.  You have to read the manual to get to know how it operates (or how to set up your camera). I figured it out myself, but was a little bit frusrated when I wanted to change something I didn't have my manual on me.

My friends all love the pictures that came out. I have been happy so far, and plan to purchase a battery pack - something that will help me to take pictures on the go without spending on non-rechargeable batteries.
