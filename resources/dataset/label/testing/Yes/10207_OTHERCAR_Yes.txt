            I have thoroughly enjoyed owning my RX 300, more so than I thought.  When I purchased it early in 1999, I had the nagging suspicion that I paid way too much.  But it seemed so capable, I bought it anyway...and I'm glad I did!  Here's why.

 COMFORT:  The cabin is quiet and smooth at reasonable speeds.  Wind noise is minimal with the sunroof closed, and road noise is nicely subdued by the extensive undercoating and door seals. The engine is nearly silent except under hard acceleration, where a pleasant growl can be heard.  The optional leather seats are supportive and crafted with exceptional materials.  After more than 4 years, they show no wear; more than I could ask for!  The carpet throughout the vehicle is well fitted, soft, and has been easy to clean.  My 2 small kids provide plenty of clean-up opportunities, too. 

HANDLING:  Lexus reached an excellent compromise between luxury and utility.  The ride is smooth, with a bit of roll on hard cornering.  A tire upgrade has solved much of this, as the factory-supplied Bridgestones were pitiful.  Typical on-road maneuvers show the stiffness and quality of the Camry-derived chassis.  My off-road experiences have been limited to snowy and muddy roads, and I have never been disappointed.  The AWD really grips well, and is seamless in operation.  Steering is very precise and not at all mushy, but the turning radius is lousy. Plan ahead for U turns!  

PERFORMANCE:   Performance from the 220 horsepower 3.0 liter V-6 is excellent, rivaling most SUV's equipped with V-8's. I've never had the slightest problem passing or freeway merging, even with 3 passengers and gear. Since I don't drive at extreme speeds, I've been very happy with the fuel economy, averaging 20 mpg in mixed city/highway driving. Braking is spectacular, best of class and better than most cars.  I have plenty of brake pad left after 36,000 miles, with no squeal or unusual rotor wear from the 4-wheel discs.

UTILITY:  Surprisingly roomy for a midsize SUV.  Cargo room is about 36 cubic feet with rear seat upright, 75 with it folded flat.  Way bigger than BMW X5, better than a Jeep Grand Cherokee, less than a Ford Explorer. Real-world usage: 2 large suitcases, a laptop, and a couple of carry-ons will easily fit in the back with the seats up.  The rear seat moves fore and aft, and can be reclined or laid flat.  Storage pockets are everywhere, and have proven very useful.  Cupholders are excellent for driver and passenger; rear-seat travelers get a rather flimsy console-mounted tray.  Trailer towing is limited to 3500 lbs., typical of it's class.

BOTTOM LINE:  An excellent value for an excellent vehicle.  This would be an outstanding choice when offered through Lexus' Certified Used Vehicle program...the extended warranty would ease the purchasing decision.  Resale value remains very strong, a testament to this fine SUV.  Best of all, after 4 years, my kids still call it "The New Car."  I can live with this kind of durability!
