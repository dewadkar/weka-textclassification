            I got my 1995 Chevy Prizm (formerly known as the Geo Prizm) towards the end of 1996.  I chose the car after exhaustive research amongst cars in its category, specifically looking for reliability (I know nothing about cars and engines, so naturally I was looking for something trouble free)and value.  Based on experience, I'm personally skewed towards Japanese imports (Toyota or Honda and the likes). Because I wasn't willing to pay much money for any car, I settled for the best value available, the Prizm, which has Chevy body (American-built body) and Toyota Corolla engine.

Having had the car for more than 3 years, I cannot give out enough praises for it. It has been very very reliable (knock on wood!!!). The only shop visits I made was to the Jiffy Lube guys to change the oil and do other standard maintenance. Boy, this car has endured so much with me, come to think of it. It's coming with me rain or shine. It doesn't mind to my swears and yells. 

I got the real basic Prizm, the one with 1.6 liter engine and nothing else (literally!).  No automatic this or that. I adore 5-speed manual transmission, and I don't mind cranking the handle to open the window.  So what I got was perfect for me. I have to admit that the seats could have been a little fluffier; I only feel this when doing long distance driving (above 5 hours). 

The power and handling are also marginal, but good enough for my purposes. The interior is decently roomy for me. Probably because of my smallish frame. The outer body wasn't made of the strongest steel available. But I wasn't looking for tank either.

All said, I think this is a car for someone like me: a person with no knowledge about engines (other than basic maintenance), doesn't want to spend too much on a car, but wants a reliable vehicle to bring him from point A to point B.  This is definitely not for those who are looking for status symbol or a muscle car.

Everything considered, I am a happy camper with my Prizm. I still have it and probably will stick with it for a couple more years.
