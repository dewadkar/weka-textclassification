            I love this vehicle.  I recently purchased one 4 months ago.  Only problem is it was in the shop for 2 weeks because once it gets up to 50,000 miles or more there is a ticking sound and the engine light will go on.  This is in all Ford explorers because it was a problem in making them.  After taking care of it though, it is back and good as new.  It usually takes about 5 days to fix this problem (it happened to me right near the holidays so it took longer) but they have to get to the heart of the problem by taking out the engine to reach where the ticking is.  They have corrected this and they informed me that 2000 and later models will no longer have this problem.  I cant's wait to buy another one because it has a smooth ride and plenty of room.<br><br>
