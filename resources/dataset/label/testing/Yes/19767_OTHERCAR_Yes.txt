             Let me tell you something first, I am not a cab driver; I am a normal person I just happen to live fifty miles from my office. As a result, I put a minimum hundred miles a day (two thousand a month) One thing I must tell you is you have to get the extended warranty (to 100K). I bought this Mazda in May of 1998, DID NOT DRIVE FOR 2 MONTH every year, and still put so many miles on it. The main reason I bought this car and the only reason someone else should buy is the gas mileage. Sure you could get better mileage on a Geo Metro, bought its so small! Or you could get about the same on a Volkswagen Passat, and pay ten thousand dollares more. I would personally recommend this car to anyone looking for a good, affordable car. Do not get the leather, automatic, or sunroof. That is all nice to have but it makes your passenger car in to a luxury car and you do not need that on a car like this what I trying to say is. Mazda 626 is a very good car, but if you need luxury go far Camry, of Accord, or Passat
