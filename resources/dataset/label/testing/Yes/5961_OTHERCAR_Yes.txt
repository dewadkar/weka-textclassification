            On moving to the States in 1997, I soon found the need to purchase a car.  Because cars are generally cheaper in the US than Australia, I had a wider range of vehicles in which to choose from.  I had always wanted a convertible, but because of prices of such cars in Australia, and the limited choices in this section, I never had the opportunity of owning one.  After deciding that I would in fact buy a convertible car, I had to make the decision as to which car I would buy.  I started to research many cars, and took numerous for test drives.  

The first car I took for a test drive was a Suzuki X 90.  While not a typical convertible, this car caught my eye because it seemed to fit into many classes.  It had the appearance of a sports utility combined with a sports car.  I decided against this car for a number of reasons.  The first reason being that I had a terrible ordeal with the salesman at the lot in which I found the car. Secondly, the car did not have the feeling of a well built, safe car.  Instead, it had an almost �tinny� feeling to it.  

The next car I considered was a Mazda Miata.  On comparison to the Honda Del Sol, a Miata has less head, leg and trunk room, is generally more expensive, and has a soft top as opposed to the Del Sol�s removable hard top.  I was concerned by the cost of repairs to the soft top, and the possibility of leakage in heavy rain. 

I also considered a Toyota Celica convertible.  The decision not be buy a Celica was a purely financial one.  While I love the shape and design of a Celica, and the fact that it has a back seat (unlike the Del Sol), it was beyond my price range. 

I settled on a Honda Del Sol as, considering my budget, it best fit my requirements, and I felt that Honda has a good reputation.  While I paid $9,000 ($US) for this car, the equivalent would cost approximately $36,000 ($AUD) in Australia.  I also felt safer while driving the Del Sol than I did when taking the smaller Miata for a test drive. 


<b>The Good:</b>

Spacious:
Even though this car appears to be small, there is plenty of head, leg and trunk space.  This is at the expense of having a back seat.  The car can comfortable contain tall drivers, as well as larger drivers, with the seat being able to be pushed back considerably if need be.  

On moving to Canada, I had to list everything that I had bought with me in the car at the immigration post at the border.  Upon showing the border control guard the list of items that I had been able to fit into the car, his jaw dropped and he inquired as to how I had been able to fit so much into such a small car.  One of the reasons for fitting so much in is the inclusion of small, lockable compartments behind the seats.  Because these compartments are lockable, I am able to store items such as CD�s in the car without too much concern.  


Removable hard top:
The hard top can be removed easily simply by pulling back on a lever on either side of the car.  The trunk contains a specially made rack in which the trunk fits.  The benefit of this is that you can take the roof with you on trips, and use it when need be.  Although easier done with a partner, I am able to remove the hard top and replace it by myself.  

While I thought that buying a car with a hard top would reduce the risk of leakage in heavy rainfall, my car does tend to leak a little in rain, though not enough to cause a major problem.  

Economy:
Instead of listing gas mileage for this car, let me tell you how far this car is driven each week, and the cost of such travel.  Before the onset of winter, my husband would drive this car to work daily.  The total distance he has to travel per day is 52 miles.  At times, he works seven days a week.  On average, he uses $25 ($CAD) in petrol per week.  He owns a 1987 Dodge Caravan, also a four cylinder.  When he takes that to work, it costs approximately $40 per week.  As you can see, this offers a great saving, especially over a longer period of time.

Fun:
Put simply, this car is fun to drive, especially in the summer when it is possible to remove the hard top.  This does make conversation a little difficult as the wind cuts down on being able to hear the other person, and I do find that my hair blows in my face a little.  


<b>The Bad</b>

Parts:
Note - Del Sols were only available in Canada for a year, all other Del Sols have been bought up from the US. 
I married a Canadian in April and we had to drive my car from California (where I had been living) to Ontario (where we now live).  The total distance for this trip was over 6000 km's (almost 4000 miles).  While the car performed great without any mechanical problems, we did blow out a tyre on the way.  The spare tyre is not one that can be used for great distances, and it is recommended that the car not be driven more than 80 km's/hour while this tyre is fitted.  Because the tyres on this car are an odd size, and because we had blown a tyre in a small town, we were unable to get the correct tyre, and luckily we were able to put a slightly larger tyre onto the car.  Had we been able to get the correct sized tyres, the bill would have been $250 ($CAD)  for two.  Because we were able to use larger tyres, we saved about $75.  

When a car is bought into Canada, it has to meet a number of conditions.  Because the Del Sol is a newer car, the cost of these conversions should have been slight.  All my car needed to meet the requirements was the addition of daytime running lamps, and a child safety harness (even though there is no backseat and children are not allowed to ride in the front).  This should have cost approximately $150.  In trying to get a safety certificate for the car, the mechanics working on the car found that the air bag computer was damaged, and this had to be replaced.  Because this part has to be a genuine Honda part in order to meet safety standards, the cost of this part was over $800 ($CAD), an expense we had not expected.

In some cases, can only be driven part of the year:
When living in California, this car was a great car for all year driving, but in moving to Canada, my Del Sol is going to have to go into hibernation for the winter.  It is just not the type of car that can handle these tough winter conditions.  


While this car is fun in the right environment, if I were to purchase a new car here in Canada, I would think twice about purchasing a Del Sol, simply because of the driving conditions here.  Overall, I feel that in the right setting, the positive aspects of owning a Del Sol outweigh the negatives.  <br><br>
