            I bought my 1993 model Toyota MR2 Turbo last year and can only say it has been an incredible car to own.  

DRIVING EXPERIENCE

One of the great joys in my life is taking a car out onto a nice, long, twisty mountain road.  

When was the last time you drove your car, just for the hell of it?  Years?  Never?  Get an MR2 and see what I'm talking about!  Another very appealing thing about the Toyota is that it combines great performance, with quite reasonable levels of refinement.  It is somewhat noisy under full throttle acceleration, but the sound is not unpleasant, especially for a sports car, whereas on the highway it is reasonably quiet.

OWNING IT

My golf clubs DO NOT fit in the trunk.  So it's not the most practical car to own, but you should be able to see that just by looking at it.  Also, this is a strict 2-seater.  Anyone more than you and a friend will be hitching a ride with someone else.  I see this as both a good and bad thing.  If I need to take more than one friend out to somewhere, I will most likely take my Camry, but when you're in the MR2, it is a much more intimate driving environment.  Oh yeah.. and no back seat drivers!  

Younger owners may have to watch out for insurance as well, as it can be quite pricey in my experience.

I would not recommend this as an ONLY car.  Get something practical as well, and enjoy the MR2 for what it is: a sports car, not a family hauler.

RELIABILITY

I have had zero major mechanical problems with the car since I acquired it.  The passenger side power window would not lower after it broke, but it was easily fixed at the Toyota repair centre.

IN SUMMARY

There's an oft-used cliche amongst people who know the MR2 well, which says &quot;3/4 Ferrari at 1/4 the price&quot;.  Enough said!
