            In March of 1999 my husband and I leased a Toyota Tacoma.  I was very apprehensive at first, having only driven small compact cars before this, but living outside the city we thought a truck would come in handy.
I was pleasantly surprised.  The truck is easy to handle and gives a great ride.  Unlike a lot of trucks, this one is relatively quiet.  The mileage is decent, anywhere between 23 and 26 mpg.  
The extended cab adds the extra needed space when you have passengers and while the back seats aren't the most comfortable, they are suitable.  I had never had a vehicle with cruise control, I think I have become addicted, it makes it so much easier not to 'accidently' speed.  The truck has proved to be very sturdy, the 16 inches of snow we had didn't cause much of a problem.  I learned to drive on ice in this truck and I can tell you I would rather learn in this truck than in a cheaper brand of truck. 
In my opinion this is a truck you can rely on.
We have had it for a year now and have had no problems with it.  After our lease is up we will almost certainly be getting another or keeping the one we have.

<b>Update: 3/6/02</b>
I still have my Tacoma and my lease will be running out this year.  I believe that once the lease is over, I am going to purchase my truck.
I have had no major repairs done on the truck, only scheduled maintenance and it is still running like a dream.  I've used it for transporting large items, taking long trips and for every day use.
I've realized something recently...the cab of my truck is much easier to load than a lot of other trucks.  I pack more things than one would believe behind the front seats with no problem at all.  
After having my truck for so long, I thought I would be able to find something to complain about, but to be honest, I just couldn't be happier with it.
It has handled so much in such a short time and I believe I can expect it to perform to perfection for quite some time to come.
