            this camera is great, even though many people don't think so, they are just over cridicle.  compaired to the canon s230 the minolta xt is best.    things that the s230 have over the xt is the image quality is better, less barrle distortion, compact flash cards, better flash and some overide functions.  the xt has over the s230 is size, zoom, movie mode lets you video the length of you sd card, s230 only lets 3 minutes of video, audio messages that go with pictures, e-mail copy, ability to digital zoom while in video mode, and you can make custom sounds for focusing and taking pictures.  

The barrle distortion is something that is on most to all digital cameras, the tipicle distortion for a small digital is .5 degres the minolta has .8, but this is do to the small lense size.  But anyways if you notice the distortion which i don't! get a bigger camera, small cameras like this are for fun, and just to have all the time with you, they are not profesional grade.  Even though i do think, that the xt is close enough.  

About the sd cards they are actually not that expensive if you shop around, costco is the cheapest; $62 for 256 mb.  that is close to the same as a compact flash card.  but once you go above the 256 mb sd card they start to get very expensive, much more then the compact flash.

Movie mode is great, you can video the length of you card, and you can use the digital zoom during video, that is something the s230 can't do.  Personaly i think the xt is a great camera, and would recomend it to people who don't mind the barely noticible distortion and soft edges.  

oh, and the battery is just fine, infact it is better then most other small digital cameras.
