            The Honda Prelude - Definitely a &quot;dream&quot; to own.  I've been a Honda owner all of my driving life (now going on 20 plus years).  My first Honda was a Civic, then an Accord and finally, &quot;MY&quot; dream car - a brand new 1996 Honda Prelude (black on black - big mistake since I now live in Texas).  The Prelude is a well-made machine.  Handles well and is great on gas.  Take care of it and it will definitely take care of you.  I have never had any major problems with any of my Hondas and the only upkeep on my Prelude since I bought it in September of 1996 is the usual maintenance (oil changes, air filter, transmission fluid change).  Hondas also hold their resale value better than most foreign cars.  I think the only draw-back of owning a Prelude is that it is a low-sitting vehicle and not very roomy.  It is more of a two-seater vehicle even though it does have back seats.  If you're thinking of buying a Prelude (or any Honda for that matter), I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Honda definitely has it going on when it comes to making cars.  I have always been a Honda owner and will continue to be a Honda owner.<br><br>
