                 ... after driving a 1999 Carrera, I think that I can safely say that this is the ultimate driving machine for just about anyone.  Okay... so it's not as exotic as a Lamborghini or not as loud as a Ferrari, but you'll make MORE heads turn w/ a Porsche.

     First of all, driving this car is simply unbelieveable.  You know those little yellow signs on curves w/ a posted recommended speed?  Well, I've doubled them and the Porsche has gripped the road wo/ the slightest hint of losing control.  This is the first car that I am scared to push to its limits.  My threshold for adventure is much lower than this car's capabilities.  I'm sure that someone w/ more guts could easily triples those recommended speeds and not be worried.  The suspension allows you to feel every nuance in the road.  The car's relatively small dimensions allow you to zip effortlessly around curves, through traffic, or anywhere else you want to go.  Your driving instructions are communicated by the steering wheel to the road so fast that you will swear that the car is reading your mind.  Again, it will handle any speed to which you dare push it (top speed is 174).  When you are ready to stop, the brakes will get you there in a matter of milliseconds.  Seriously, if I would ever have to slam the breaks on my car in traffic, I know I'd be able to stop, but I'd be worried about getting rear-ended.

     Okay, so the Porsche drives great, so why should you get it?  Well, regardless of which Porsche model you buy, it's unmistakenly a Porsche. This car has such a great legacy, and as much as they've changed the models in the past few years, you can tell a 20 year old 911.  Trust me, it'll still turn heads.  It's more readily identifiable than a Lamborghini or a Ferrari even though it may not be quite as exotic.  

     This car will delight everyone from an avid car enthusiast to someone that just wants a cool car.  The speed and performance will satisfy the most demanding of drivers.  Still, this does not come at the expense of drivability.  Put your grandmother in this car, and she'll have an easy time driving it.  It's very well-mannered and even gets good gas mileage (20 MPG).  Not bad for a car that will blow away just about anything else w/ it's 290 hp 3.4 L engine.  It's not quite as loud as other supercars.  Most of all, it's relatively cheap in comparisons to the cars it competes against.  I think that Road &amp; Track did a comparison about a year ago, and they came up w/ the same conclusion.

      What are the negative points about this car.  Well, although they are a few complaints, most of these are a result of this being a true sportscar.  The suspension is so stiff that it may even hurt over extremely bumpy roads.  There is minimal space to store things in the trunk (although folding down the rear seats allows you to fit a fair amount of stuff in the back.)  The backseats are completely useless.  The wide tires make winter driving hazardous.
 
      There are some Porsche specific complaints that I found.  You expect a higher quality finish for a car at this price.  Not that they should include wood or cupholders, but the plastics are somewhat cheap and easily scratched.  Some of the movable parts aren't so well assembled, and I've spent a fair amount of time getting things fixed.  With the new Boxster sharing so many parts w/ the 911, it loses some of its exotic appeal.  I've seen quite a few Boxsters around Philadelphia.

     Despite these minor complaints, this is a car that you simply have to have if you can afford it.  The drive on this car is an experience that will make you wonder how much better can driving get.  Despite its relative few shortcomings, I would highly suggest this to anyone that's looking for a second car.  It's has tons of sex-appeal and yet you won't feel like it's too flashy that you can't drive it.  You simply must have this car.<br><br>
