            After my wife complained about her Sebring sitting too low I traded it for a used 1995 Honda Passport 4x4. Now she is in love with her truck.  The 95 Passport is an unusual combination of a GM 3.2 V-6, Isuzu body, and Honda trim touches to the interior, body and engine.
  
The biggest obstacle to buying an SUV was the turning radius.  My wife insisted that the choice we made should not require an entire parking lot to turn around like the Nissan Pathfinder. The Passport had the tightest steering of all the SUVs we tested. Another advantage to her was more mid-size vs. full size Titanic SUVs. Rear door entry, however, is made more difficult due to the intrusion of the rear wheel wells into the rear doors. 
 
On my list was decent take-off power and braking. While the gas mileage is low (avg. 15 mpg) and it is not a screamer on the road, ours is equipped with a &quot;power&quot; button on the center console. This holds the automatic transmission in lower gears until higher RPMs are achieved, resulting in faster acceleration. There is also a &quot;Winter&quot; button that locks the transmission in 3rd gear to stop wheel spin.  Couple this with the 4 wheel drive mode and even the worst snow seems passable. The brakes are 4 wheel disc but stopping still seems to take a little long.  About the same as a full size pick-up with a disc/drum set up.

Externally, the body style is what I think a SUV should look like. The classic truck like lines without sharp edges just seems appealing.  I highly recommend the optional 16 inch alloys, they change the whole appearance of the truck.  The interior suffers the same fate as many cars do...cheap plastic and not enough cup holders.  The seats, however, are comfortable enough for a couple of ten hour trips I took to the coast.  The outward vision is great due in large part to ride height and well place roof pillars. 

General maintenance is easy. Most items are within easy reach and are plainly marked but the drive belts have 3 different types of tensioners.  There has been only one reason to take the truck to the dealer outside of general maintenance.  A recall on the voltage regulator for the alternator was at risk of causing a &quot;thermal incident&quot;.  I talked to Honda of North America about it and they treated me respectfully, politely, and made no excuses.  The problem was fixed within 90 minutes of arriving at the dealer.   
 
All around this has been one of the best vehicles we have owned despite being used.
