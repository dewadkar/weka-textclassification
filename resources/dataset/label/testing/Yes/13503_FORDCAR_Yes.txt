            When we set out to buy a SUV, we had it narrowed down to a Dodge Durango or Ford Explorer. We decided on the Explorer for a two reasons. The first was reliability. Consumer Reports didn't have a whole lot of good stuff to say on the Durango, but they heaped praise on the Explorer. When we buy something, we want to know that it has a good reputation and will last for the long haul. The second reason was price. We has a certain configuration in mind, and with the Explorer, it ran about 27k, while the same configuration in the Durango ran about 31k. To the Durango's credit, we were hooked on the appearance. The Durango had a revolutionary style, while the Explorer's was more evolutionary.

We purchased the Consumer Reports packet on the Explorer for $12 (all that information is available online now at (www.edmunds.com for free). CR gave the Explorer a glowing review, which rubbed off on us. We went to the dealer the next day.

Knowing that it would need to be able to climb a snowy mountain in the winter, we purchased a 4WD loaded with most of the options for around 27k. This seemed very reasonable to us in light of the Durango's price.

After owning it for around 6 months now, I can honestly say that it's a great truck. The styling is great, but conservative, I prefer the Durango for that category. The interior is nice and well laid out. There's plenty of room in the hatch for toting stuff around. The legroom for driver and passenger is nice. There's one option that it has that I would highly recommend, automatic headlights. We've never turned the headlights on or off! They come on when it's dark, and turn off when it's light, or when you turn off the truck. The headlights will stay on after you've switched off the ignition for however long you want, all controlled by a little slider switch on the rear view mirror. The stock CD player/changer sounds ok, but is lacking deeper tones. I really like the fact that the CD player is mounted sideways in the center console. It makes changing CD's very easy. Side note-the magazine for the CD changer is very flimsy. Looks like it was made at a dollar store.

 We have had two problems since we bought it, the first being that a lower control arm bolt was loose and caused a lot of knocking in the front end, and the first time we pulled a boat, the bumper slipped out of whack. The control arm bolt had the potential of being dangerous, but the bumper was more of an annoyance. Either way, it wasn't hard to fix, as we just took it to the dealer, they tightened everything up, and were back on the road again. It did make me wonder a little bit though about Ford's quality control if 2 bolts were loose on a brand new truck.

Driving the Explorer is fine, it rides well, and is quite comfortable. Rough road is no problem, and driving up a washed out gravel mountain is simple. We put it in 4WD one day and went through a construction site, and everything worked like a champ. It grabbed in the loose mud, pulled up steep incline, and braked easily on downslopes. By the time we were done, it was totally covered in mud, which is something you very rarely see on Explorers. 

It's pricey, but very polished, which contributes to the lack of character is seems to have. Other friends of mine that have Explorers just don't talk about them a lot, it's just kinda there, doing it's job. 

We opted for the 210HP V6, and the lower V6 just didn't have much oomph. It's not great on gas mileage, but it feels much better to drive. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this truck to anyone looking to buy an SUV. It does it's job well.
