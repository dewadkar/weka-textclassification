            Overview:   The Nissan Altima is the the car of the future for Nissan.  It has a luxury feel at an economy price.  I have been searching for my ideal car for the past few months and the Altima kept rising to the top.

Exterior:10  Hello Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti.  Take off the Nissan badges and you would have no idea what luxury car it is.
    
Interior:9  Interior is very spacious and comfortable.  The adjustable seats almost give too many options. I am 6'3" and I have plenty of room.  Beware:  The Sunroof takes off 2" of headroom.  Weakness: The charcoal cloth in my car attracts lint.  Tape is the solution.

Engine:10   The engine is top notch.  Despite being in a new car the v6 is standard in the Pathfinder, Maxima, and soon to be the 350Z.  It has plenty of power quick acceleration and high speed passing. 
 
Handling:9    The 17" wheels on the 3.5 stick like tape to the road surface.  Very little body roll.

Ride:9   The ride is very smooth.  Some large pot-holes can be a little jarring, but overall the ride at 80MPH could not be too much smoother.

Reliability:  Unknown?  This was the only reason I was concerned buying a new model.  I was comfortable with the engine because it is an award winning engine for 8 years but didn't know much else about the car.  So far I haven't had any problems.  I will update if I do.

Value: 10   It would be extremely hard to find a 240 HP car with the looks and feel of a luxury car under 25 K.  After NJ taxes (6%) I walked away under 23 K. 

Other contenders:  
VW Passat :Too Expensive and lacks power
Toyota Camry:  Nice but a little boring
Honda Accord:  Would wait for 2003 for new body design.
