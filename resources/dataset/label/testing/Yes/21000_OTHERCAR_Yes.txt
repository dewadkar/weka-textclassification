            I bought my RAV 4 in August and I totally love it!  My RAV is four door, automatic, all wheel drive and came equipped with power door locks, keyless entry, alarm system, cd player and much much more.  I did a fair bit of research before buying my RAV.  I previously owned a car and wanted something that was more practical for my lifestyle.  My RAV is perfect for going mountain biking, snowboarding, camping, etc.  The two back seats fold up and create quite a roomy area for hauling all of my gear.  I have even slept in the back with my dog quite comfortably!!

The RAV handles great and is unbelievably good on the highway.  Even though it has a 4 cylinder engine it has good pick-up.  The ride is smooth, it is super comfortable to drive and easy on gas.  I haven't had the opportunity to drive on icy roads a whole lot with it yet but in the one blizzard we had the RAV performed quite well.  

As far as reliability, I have heard nothing but good things about the reliability and performance of the RAV and so far I haven't had any problems.

I have to really struggle to come up with any bad points about the RAV but I guess I would have to say that the interior is rather plain and Toyota should come with some options such as leather rather than one base model.

I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves to have fun.
