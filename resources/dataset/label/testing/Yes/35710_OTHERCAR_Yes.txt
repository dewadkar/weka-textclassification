            I've been driving my Montana Green 1992 VW GTI for a few years now, and love it to death.

The 1992 GTI came with 2 engine options. The 2.0l 16v, and the 1.8l 8v. The 8v engine has more low end torque, but the horsepower doesn't compare to the 16v. If you like freeway driving the 16v is the way to go, but for more economical city driving try to get the 8v. The 8v also is less prone to blown headgaskets, and electronic problems.

The interior of this car is of two packages. The 16v package comes with sport recaro seating and sporty doorcards. The recaro seats are very comfortable and soft. The stock 8v seating is stiff. The interior is still very '80s in this car, which is something that you have to love about it. Instead of buttons there are switches you flip on and off, a green illuminated dash, and a very short shifter. 

The handling of this car is great, so is the drivability. Because it sits so low to the ground it's great for going fast in, and with a stiffer suspension it handles like a beast, but beware of off-roading this bad boy unless you don't mind bottoming out a lot.

My GTI was recently in an accident, and I believe this is where the most trust lies here. I was unharmed, hit by a large chevy truck. While there was about $3000 worth of damage to the front of my car (mostly for paint) I was able to easily find new fenders and a hood in a junkyard. Parts for these viehicles are easy to come by, especially in junkyards. The body shares the same front end as the golf and jetta, so you can use any 1985-1992 VW hood, fender, grill, etc. 

Parts from the dealer are going to be more expensive than a domestic viehicle, but that is to be expected since the parts are mostly all german made, and better quality. Starters, alternators, and batteries are not going to be any more expensive, but things like waterpumps, headlights, bumpers, and the like are very spendy.

Seeing as this car is 10 years old now, expect to have tools handy and be working on it quite a bit. If you are looking into buying one be sure and ask what all has been replaced, because chances are something will go wrong on it eventually... but wouldn't you say that about any car this old?
