            Best Kept Secret!

The Dodge Avenger is a cool sleek automobile! It is very fast and handles like a Corvette, I purchased this vehicle with the intentions of commuting to and from work attempting to eliminate the mundane.  Well it worked! The car is awesome, I enjoy driving it primarily because of the engine and its inner components are developed and built by Mitsubishi. I have owned a Mitsubishi in the past and I have never had any mechanical problems with it. Like my previous Mitsubishi this car purrs like a cat. 

What I love most about the car is it's sleek lines and stealthy profile, the color schemes are cool and refreshing! This car is simply the best kept secret; from 0-60 in under a min. (depending on conditions make it a true street contender.  

The sound system, which is developed by Infinity, sounds awesome, clarity and road noise is all but eliminated during those long commuter hours. I should know I travel 2.5 hours one way everyday Mon. through Friday!

I believe anyone who enjoys driving will enjoy driving the Avenger, from its upper scale style and its robust engine makes it toy worth investing in!

The only downside is the paint quality, which seems to attract road debris as if it were a magnet, but care and wax should keep the scratch scale down some.

If you are faint of heart stay away from the Avenger this car will surprise even the most wickedest commuter devil!!!!
