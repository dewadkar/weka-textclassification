            This is my fifth Nissan Maxima purchase.  I have had 2 1990s, one 1985, and my kid has a 1998.  The 2000 Maxima is far and away the best of them.  Obviously, I am partial to this car in its many incarnations, but in terms of comfort and handling the 2000 is the most outstanding.  Some drivers will complain about the lack of road feel at high speeds, but for someone like me (older) the drivability is fantastic.  I just got back from an eight hundred mile trip and feel as relaxed as if I had been home in front of the fire reading a book.  The seats hold both passengers and drivers in the best of bucket comfort.  The controls are easy to read, and Maxima has solved some earlier problems that it had with switches that were hard to see.  The engine is a monster, and yet, at the same time it is exceedingly quiet.  You can be flying at 80 or 85 mph and not feel a thing.  Best to set the on-steering-wheel cruise control.  The climate control is intuitive adjusting itself readily to all climatic conditions.  The on board CD player with 7 speakers plays Sinatra or Medeski, Martin and Wood or Beethoven at any level without distortion.  Those piano sonatas that I favor are clear as bell.  A nice touch to the car is a deep center console designed especially to hold up to sixteen CDS.  Now if someone could just figure out how to handle those jewel boxes when you are flying along at 65 miles per hour. . . .

In terms of roominess, the front seats are quite comfortable, and my frontseat passenger on my eight hundred mile trip seemed to be happy as he snored away at least 50 percent of the time.  My two backseat passengers commented repeatedly about how nice the backseat was and how much legroom they had.  In terms of quality of workmanship, not even one small item was out of place.  I have been buying cars for thirty years and this is the first time that I have taken delivery where the car was absolutely perfectly put together.  The engine too seems perfectly tuned and operates at max efficiency.

There have been lots of complaints about the outside styling of this car and I must admit that its rear view takes some getting used to, but the 2000 Maxima is such a comfortable car and the interior is so elegant that the funny looking trunk side begins to grow on you.  I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an easy to drive, fairly nicely styled sedan at a not too high price.<br><br>
