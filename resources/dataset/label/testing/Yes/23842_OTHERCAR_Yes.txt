            We recently decided it was time to purchase another vehicle.  We went looking and I had my mind made up that I wanted a used Honda Accord.  We looked and look and finally went to our friends dealership and told him what we had been looking at.  He recommended the ECHO.

  Same amount of $$$ as the car we had been looking at but, it was brand spanking new and it came with warranties.  I took it for a test drive and was amazed at the roominess and luxury of the interior.  Lots of compartment for storage and it really gets up and boogies when you need it to. 

 I kind of looks like a cross between a VW Jetta and a VW Bug.  I got the 4 dr model in the Green color.  I get lots of looks going down the road.  People come up beside me and look for the emblem to see what it is and you can read their lips as they say, &quot;Wow, that's a Toyota!&quot;  

Great gas mileage too!!  It sits up higher than any other compact car.  You actually step down when you get out of it. We recently had some snow and it handled great!  I love this car!!<br><br>
