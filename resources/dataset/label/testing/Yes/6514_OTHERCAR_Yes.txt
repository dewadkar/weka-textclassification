            I had owned a Volvo 240 sedan for 3 years when my wife decided it was time to upgrade her college car into a car she'd be comfortable with for the next 6-8 years. My stellar experience with a used Volvo led us to a local Volvo dealer where we started test driving everything from their brand new V70s and V90s to their used models like the 850s, 940s and 960s.  

We eventually settled on wanting a station wagon because we have a dog and know we'll have kids in the next few years.  Plus, the only wagons out there that can pass as stylish are Volvos, Mercedes and BMWs.  The lot had a beautiful 2 year old red 960 station wagon with only 19,000 miles on it, priced just below blue book value.

When we stepped into the car for a test drive in this 960 Wagon, we smelled quality leather and noticed the classy wood trim on the dash components.  The seats were super comfortable and supportive and amenities galore.  We couldn't believe the power this long, heavy car had.  With 194 horses, it could really move and power through turns.

With a little bit of haggling, we bought the car for $23K and have never regretted the decision for a second.  13 months later, we're still smelling the leather and still amazed with how quickly the car can get up to speed and pass trucks, etc.

The wagon has immense space.  It's like having a pick up truck.  I've fit a couch in the back, a lawnmower, lumber all the time, our dog enjoys the extra room and we've driven with 6 people in the car very comfortably.

It gets about 23 mpg on the highway and 20 mpg in the city.  It looks sharp, it suits our needs and we've not had a single problem with it mechanically.

I don't think our family will ever own a car other than Volvos.  Just too classy and safe to go anywhere else.<br><br>
