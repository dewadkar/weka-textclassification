            Driving the 626 is an experience that I have enjoyed.  It handles well in the Rocky Mountain terrain and keeps it's speed on the mountains.  No lagging for this car.  Gas mileage is good and it looks and handles like a luxury car for a third of the price.
There is plenty of room in the front seat for those who need the leg space, but don't get stuck in the back.  It's a killer on the knees.  The seats do move up for more comfort, but at the expense of the person sitting in the front.  
Nice for just starting out.  A good run around car, as well as a car for a road trip.  Just stop every now and then to stretch.
Stereo is nice and has good sound.
I like the option of having a CD player with the stereo.<br><br>
