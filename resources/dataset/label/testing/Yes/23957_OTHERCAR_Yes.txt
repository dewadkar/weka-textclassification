            I tell you, this camera might be for everyone except people who fall into two groups.  Those would be professional photographers, but even my brother who is a professional would love using this for personal photos at holidays.  The second group might be the elderly who have trouble holding onto small things.  Other than that, this is an awesome camera.  I don't know why people are complaining about battery life.  Maybe the was in earlier versions of this camera and Nikon fixed it, but I have taken at least 50 pics with no sign of battery deterioration.  The flash is still strong and the pictures get saved to compact flash very quickly compared to cameras of just a couple years ago.  I am using the 16 MB Lexar 8x CF that came with it, and I did notice a slow down when using a friends 128MB CF from Sandisk which is only 4x.  Based on that observation, I would buy Lexar CF's with speeds around 12x or so and you should have no problem with writing speed of pictures.  The thing I love at this camera is that I don't have to think or have knowledge about photography at all to take great pictures.  I have found that keeping it on auto will take the best pics.  It focuses very fast even in darker lighting and like I said, the shutter lag time is very minimal under normal situations.  I think the only things I dislike about this camera is that they should have either included the rechargeable battery set, or the AC adapter.  There should be no reason to use up all the battery just uploading pictures to the computer.  And get this, I didn't install the software at all, just plug it into the USB port and access the camera as a portable drive.  That is awesome, just open up My Computer and you are on your way.  I suggest using the Camera to delete the pics though instead of on the computer.  I think this caused me to have an empty file one time.  The flexibility of this camera is great and beginners to amateurs should love the features and ease of use of this camera.  This is a great buy for only $240.
