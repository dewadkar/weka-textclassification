            This vehicle is my baby. I bought it used on Labor Day of 1997, my first car purchase made on my own. It is a 1995 automatic transmission with a spoiler and the color, &quot;Nassau Blue&quot;, is very sharp. 
This is a beautiful car with curves galore; It is a pleasure to admire and also a pleasure to drive.

My MX6 is only a 4 cylinder but has a lot of power with its dual overhead cams. It's very roomy if you are in the front....if you plan on taking a road trip with your friends, better ask them to drive. Sitting in the back is like being stuffed into an airplane's overhead compartment.
I am 5'11 and have lots of leg room and head room up front. You're guaranteed a smooth ride and virtually no road noise when you cruise around. I think it has a pretty good sound system too for being factory speakers, but I installed a 6 disk cd changer because the car only has a tape deck in it. Another beautiful thing about the car is the visibility. The hood just slopes and drops off so all you see is open road wherever you look, and if you take your eyes off the road for a sec you may just find the other drivers checking you out in your good lookin' driving machine :-). 

The only thing I found in the car that I don't care for is the fact that the windows on the doors don't have frames around them, which is a pain when it is raining out and you have your window rolled down even a crack. The water will roll right down off the roof and onto your arm and the floor. Kind of annoying. I have been maintaining the car as you should, oil changes and what not, and the car only has 54,000 miles on it. It is in excellent shape but I did have a problem with the transmission recently. Turns out the inhibitor switch needed replaced, but it took 4 mechanics find this out. Seems no one knew what was going on and I went through a tune-up, a new air and fuel filter, had the injectors cleaned and had the idle adjusted before a transmission specialist pinpointed the problem. It was crazy to drive before I had it repaired however, the engine would rev up and the RPM's would go up really high then come back down. The car would jerk while you drove it (and you never knew when it would happen)which was kind of embarrassing not to mention very aggravating, and the car would periodically stall out when you came to a stop or put it in gear from Park. However now that it has been repaired it drives like a champ. 
Overall I am extremely satisfied with my car, looks good, runs good and I plan on keeping her for a long time. <br><br>
