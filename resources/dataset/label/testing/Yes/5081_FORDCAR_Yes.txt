            The Ford Taurus is the best american car ever made. And for good reason. When Ford decided to remake the Taurus in 1996, there were skeptics. Soon, the wait proved to be worth itself. The remodeled Taurus was a huge successful, and might I say, one heck of a car. I have a Gold 1997 Ford Taurus, and after 3 years, i have had no problem. Currently there are 75,000 miles; highway and city. The only slight thing i have noticed is the paint has began to chip on the front and rear bumpers as a result of snow from the winter time. But a simple 5 dollar touch up always does the trick. With the exterior well crafted and streamlined for efficiancy, the interior is all the more better. Enough room to comfortable fit 6, i have no complaints of my passengers. The leather interior is quite the comfortable seat. And enough trunk room to fit 6 full pieces of luggage, far more than my past auto, the 92 Mercury Sable. With all the qualities to make this a luxuary car, you would think it'd be costing an arm and leg. Wrong. Fully loaded, i bought mine for just under 22,000. The prices are still about the same today. For anyone looking to buy a strong, domestic auto that will last for years and handle like a bute, the Ford Taurus is defantely for you.<br><br>
