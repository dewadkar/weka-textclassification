            I never want another day off!!!! Well, perhaps that is a bit hasty a decision. Maybe just not a day off while it's raining. On second thought I'll take any day off I can get. However, I do think it would be in my best interest to stay home and not go out on those days. Here's what happened on my rainy day off last week.

I was bored, couldn't hang out around the pool, could not cut grass in the rain, and how much housework can one undomesticated woman do?
So I hop in my car that I have owned for eighteen short months and just for kicks drive to the dealership. I do believe I know now why they have the word <b>DEAL</b> in their name.

While just browsing through the catalogues, a salesman happened up behind me asking if he could be of some help. Without turning around I said nope just looking. Next he says well if it isn't MS Hollywood, I had my sunglasses on because they were all I could read with. It happened to be the salesman I have traded with for over fifteen years. He asked if I needed to borrow his truck, to which I commented no why. He said I thought maybe your car was in service. Another negative response from me.

Then it happened, he said oh let me show you what we have just gotten in, a deal </B>(there's that word again)</b> you can't miss.
Being a good sport I let him show me this minivan, then we went for a ride.
It did handle very nicely, and was quite comfortable. He jabbered while I drove about all the wonderful features of this vehicle. Yes, all impressive I told him, but I'm not looking to buy.

He asked if I was still traveling for work, when I told him yes he inquired how I got my belongings from place to place. I had <b>instant flashback</b> of the horrible trip back from FL to NC with a rental truck.
OK so I agreed I could use more space, but my car was not even a year old yet. Once back to the lot, where he saved the <b>big nail in my coffin,</b> he said did I tell you 0% financing charges for the entire sixty months? 

Next thing I knew I was driving out with a new 2001 Chevy Venture. Indeed even adding a substantial amount from my car to the loan, my payments were lower than what I had been paying. No, I'm not an easy mark, he could sell a mule wagon to cruise line, and I wasn't even left braying. It was a good move. Here's some information on my new found set of wheels.

<b>Safety Features:</b> Of course the nurse in me consider these features a necessity.

This vehicle comes with a year free of <b>OnStar</b> emergency service which I had never even heard of.
For those of you who fast forward through commercials like I do. This is a computer system you can activate from your vehicle. They can tell you where you are <b>(even when you don't know)</b> If the airbag has been released they call to see if you need assistance, if they get no answer they automatically deploy emergency services. If any of the service lights come on, with one push of an overhead button, you will get a live speaking person that can run a diagnostic test on your vehicle, while you are still driving, letting you know what the problem is, and if you need to seek immediate service. There is an emergency button you can press for you guessed it <b>emergencies.</b> Such as, if you are being followed you can push this button tell them the problem, they will have you keep driving and send police to you, after all they know where you are. One of the best features of this service, is if you lock your keys in the car, you call them with your pin number and without waiting for someone to come open he door it's all done through the computer. Hmmmm not a bad little gadget.

-----Corrosion Perforation - 72 months/100,000 miles
-----Major Components - 36 months/36,000 miles
Roadside Assistance - 36 months/36,000 miles
The extended warranty can be purchased anytime before the 3 years of original coverage has expired.

I have only had this vehicle less than a week, and have already enlisted two other buyers. Perhaps this will be the <b>first vehicle</b> I have ever kept the entire length of the contract.
It handles as well as any car, and with a beach trip with <b>four children</b> in 2 weeks I believe this will make the trip most enjoyable. So now they all will have their own seat and <b>seat belt</b>...........Life is good.
