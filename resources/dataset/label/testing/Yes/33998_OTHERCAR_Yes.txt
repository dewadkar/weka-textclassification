            <B>Intro</B>
I love cars, and one thing I find fascinating about automobiles is how they blend the practical with the emotional and target that mixture toward a specific price point. When it comes to selecting a good 4-door sedan, the choices are enormous as are the price points. At the pragmatic extreme, there's the Honda Civic or Toyota Camry. At the emotional extreme, a Jaguar or Benz. You can pay $14k for a brand-new sedan or pay $100k and you get four wheels, brakes, and an engine on either end.

When my wife & I decided to donate our '85 BMW 325e to charity, we settled first on a price point for the replacement car. Some buyers approach car-buying from a different set of factors first, but given our budget, we set the price first and then narrowed down the features and attributes. Then we came up with a short list of models.

<B>New or Used?</B>
Fact: All new cars extract a dollar premium from you for their newness. If you must have that new-car smell, the factory warranty (but why buy a car that breaks in its first 3 years?), and the kick of being the first on the block to have it, then buy new.

But my wife & I are more practical, and you definitely get more car for the money if you buy a good model in good condition with low miles. 

We settled on $20k for our price point and a willingness to buy used.

<B>My Review</B>
Our features and attributes list included four doors, leather interior, automatic transmission, reputation for reliability, and some degree of perceived luxury. So we considered BMW, Audi, Volvo, Lexus, and Acura seriously.

For the money, we felt that our black '96 3.2TL (with 34k miles on it at purchase) was a superior value at $20,400. For that price, I would challenge anyone not connected to the mob to find a stronger, roomier, more luxurious sedan with Honda reliability.

The car feels new, solid, and jewel-like in construction (I write this in April '01). The reliability is Honda legendary, meaning, nothing ever goes wrong just change the oil and do the tune-ups. And I drive our car pretty hard, revving the engine frequently and braking quickly.

The ride quality is a cross between German rigid and American soft. Perhaps too soft for very inspired twisties, but your passengers will love the cushiness on long trips or over broken pavement. Every mechanical device works flawlessly, and I reserve special kudos for the (1) climate control system, (2) in-dash CD/cassette/radio and (3) automatic transmission.

The climate control has a "full auto" setting that works brilliantly. Simply turn the large rotary knob (love knobs in cars!) to whatever temperature you desire, and the system does the rest, turning on or off the AC or heater or fan to achieve the desired temperature. You can fiddle manually with it but I almost never do and am quite happy with the results.

The audio system should be required study for all car manufacturers. It does only what you need it to do and nothing else and does it very well. The ergonomics are superb (pet peeve: car audio systems that are about as simple as 747 controls) and the sound is excellent with 8 speakers and massive sound-proofing throughout (even the C-pillars are filled with acoustic-dampening foam).

If you want an auto tranny, this is a great one. Shifts are very smooth and happen at the right rev point and if you want some more fun, knock the leather-covered knob into "D3" and it delays upshifts and won't go into overdrive (results: higher revs and more power). I drive in D3 all the time unless I'm on the freeway.

The engine is a Honda V-6 displacing 3.2 liters and putting out 200 hp. That means it's ultra-reliable and relatively powerful. You get muscle and can drive the snot out of it without worry. I could use more torque at lower revs but it's not so bad as on some other 6-cylinder engines I've driven. It even makes a spine-tingling roar if you get it spinning above 3500 rpm.

<B>Negatives</B>
All this driving fun is tainted, however, by one big negative: overly boosted steering. Some drivers perceive this as a plus; you can execute a 3-point turn with your pinky finger. I like German cars' low-boosted steering which usually results in more handling feel (and bigger biceps). Road feel is surprisingly nuanced on the TL, however, despite the too-powerful boost. But when you combine the front-wheel drive with the powerful steering boost, you definitely lose some driving excitement and precision.

Speaking of front-wheel drive, it is. It's a great front-driver, but it won't handle like a rear-wheel driver or an all-wheel driver and never can. But as front-drivers go, it's balanced and lacking disruptive torque steer (and if you drive in the rain/snow, front drive is good).

The interior is a class above what you're paying for. Passengers always think the car costs way more than it does once they sit inside it. The leather surfaces, the [fake] wood paneling, the sound proofing, the solid precision of the assembly ... all add up to an environment that feels much more expensive than it is. It doesn't feel inside like a Honda :-)  It feels more like a Mercedes or higher-end BMW.

You also get every option that you could want beyond the really superfluous ones (we bought a model that was equipped with the Premium Package; I'd highly suggest finding a similar one). Power-adjusted and heated leather seats, heated outside power mirrors, power moonroof, in-glass radio antenna, ski pass-through from the trunk, front and rear leather-clad armrests, remote keyfob, the aforementioned in-dash CD/cassette/radio system, ABS, traction control, steering wheel-mounted cruise control, big alloy wheels....  If you want more options than these, you've passed into "extraneous" territory for me.

Besides the steering boost negative, I'd also give lower marks to the headroom (the ceiling is too low) and the factory wheel size. I'm 5'11" and the ceiling comes too close to my head. The wheels, while beautiful and solid, are too thin at 205s. I'd prefer 215s at least on a car this long and wide.

These are quibbles. For the money, for a sedan, you can't do better.
