            I drive a Ford Expedition and due to the price of gas, I starting looking for a second more economical car to buy or lease. My priorities were it must be comfortable for 9 hour drives, have a large enough interior for four adults and a trunk for their luggage. The Altima SE met all of my requirements. With the sport suspension HR rated tires, cruise control, Moon roof, lumbar support, I find it the most comfortable in it's class. 

This car handles better than a Camaro I used to own and I am getting 25 MPG highway and city combined. 
It is actually fun to drive with the 5 speed transmission. The ride is smooth unlike most sport suspensions.

Nissan could have left the cigarette lighter in the car even though I do not smoke.
The body style is pretty boring; it just does not do justice to the car. This body style looks like all of the rest of the cars in any parking lot. If Nissan could put a sporty looking body, it would be a great car.

Anyone looking for a 4 door car with enough space for four adults or two adults and three children will love this car. If you are looking for a sports car this is not the car for you. It just does not have a sports cars looks.
