            When I was in the market for a new car I did all my research.  I was searching for a sensible car that wasn't huge, but not tiny like the Geo Metros either.  I checked out Hondas, Toyotas, VW's, and everything in between.  After comparing prices and the options available, I found that Saturn offered the best deal.  That alone was enough to convince me.  I had already decided on the Saturn SL1.  From there it only got better!  It turned out to be a really enjoyable purchase.  After my experience, I wouldn't mind going through the hassle of buying a car again.  

What I love most about the car....its reliable, but not too fancy.  What I hate most about it....the little &quot;dummy shifting light&quot; that blinks all the time!  

The actual drive is very smooth.  It has good power, it feels very safe.  It handles well in the snow too!  The Saturn maintanence prices are very reasonable, so I feel comfortable taking it to them.  I know that the work will be done correctly, and I won't pay an arm and a leg like most dealers charge.

I would recommend this car to somebody looking to buy a nice new car but not spending a lot of money.  Somebody that doesn't have a lot of kids.  Perhaps a couple in their 20s, that are just starting out!  Or even a single lady that is a little bit older.  <br><br>
