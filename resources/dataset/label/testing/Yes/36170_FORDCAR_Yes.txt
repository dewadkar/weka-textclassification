            I have had my car now for about four months, and I
Must say I am pretty happy, and at the same time uncertain. Now that I
Have the car broken into with 14000 miles on it, I must
say �it runs great�. The handling on the car is great,
Controls on the car are easy to use, the safety
Features on it make me feel safe in this LA traffic,
I love the extra large trunk, not to mention the
awesome stereo system it has it.

I find this car very convenient to purchase, for about
15,000 you can get a fully loaded car (minus a
sunroof), that is stylish, comfortable, and safe.

Now buying the car wasn't fun.  When I bought my
FOCUSES SE, the dealer must have thought that I was really dumb.
After seeing the car I wanted and after doing all the paper
work, when I�m  getting ready to drive off the lot I
notice scratches on the roof and dents in the hood
(from what I understand I'm not the only person that
received a damage car). Then trying to get the dealer
to repair it was just ridiculous.

Second, it being a FORD.  I have had the fallowing problems. So far my
brakes have been squeaking since day one, and the
dealer have just about given me every excuse in the
book. I finally called ford, I take my car in next
week,  I�ll see what happens.

Third, I really think my car has some king of
electrical problem.  Sometimes my trunk wont open, or
the speed control will not set, or my trunk won't open
when I push the button.  I have tried to take it in to my 
local dealer, and all they tell me is that there familer with 
this problem.  And since it
only happens once in a while, I can never prove it to
them.


Over all I am very satisfied with my car. I need to get 
these things worked out, but overall it really is a good car.

One recommendation I have if you looking for a ford Focus be sure to check the web for pricing, and bring that information to the dealer with you.  As I have learned they have tried to mix combos of the LX, SE, ZTS. This only benefits them.
