            UPDATE 08-30-02 (At 150,000 miles I began to suffer extreme power loss that was attributed to burnt valves. The mechanic told me this was perfectly normal for a carborated engine with this many miles on it. Repair cost was $593.00 but it has it's power back now. On to the next 150,000!)

End Update-

I bought this truck after my 1986 Chevy Cavalier gave up the ghost in the summer of 2000. 
I didn't have a lot of money and I wasn't sure I was gonna be able to really get anything that good. 
Out one day with a friend touring the used car lots I spotted a light blue Mazda B2200 with a matching blue camper top. After a quick check for leaks I was out the door for 4500. 
I'm writing this review about 22 months after my purchase and I can say I am not at all disappointed in this truck. 
When I bought her she had exactly 94K on the motor and in less that two years I have put over fifty thousand miles on her with few problems. Took it to Fort Worth which is where my folks live many times(400 mile drive one way) without any problems. Has a cold A/C and fairly smooth shifter considering the mileage. 
When I got it I knew it had a rocker/valve cover seal leak, since I do some of my own work I knew this was a normal repair at 94K. I fixed it and have not had any leaks since. 
Of course it does have the famous Mazda blue smoke on start up problem that has to do with the valve stem seals over the pistons, but this is normal for Mazda's built from about 87-97. I have spoken to several people that own Mazda vehicles and they say the blue smoke has been with them for years and has not effected them at all. You can check Mazda posting boards and you will find lots of Mazda's with 250K on them that have smoked for years without any major problems. 
This truck has been pretty darn reliable. I had a spell where I had about 5 things go out on it in a short period of time, like water pump, radiator, etc. But this is quite normal for trucks on their way to 200K. Think you can get a Ford or Dodge to go that long without any problems? Think again! Since then she has run perfect. 
One of the things that aren't so good about this truck is the lack of power. I have a 2200, so I have a 2.2 litter engine, I wish many times that I had a 2600 2.6 litter, but this is what I chose to buy :( Power is often lacking. 
The seats kill my legs after about two straight hours of driving, not good. 
Other than that, I am in love with my pretty blue Mazda, it's just too bad Ford makes the B series and not Mazda now. 
I think 92 was the last year the Japanese made their Mazda trucks before Ford took over. 
If you can get this truck with less than 100K on it and you don't have a need for lot's of power, I would say without a doubt to go for it.
