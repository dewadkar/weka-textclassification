            Terrific first time digital camera!  So simple even my 4 year old uses it! Affordable enough to allow user to buy Essential add-ons.  Camera case, rechargeable batteries, compact flash memory and USB card reader.  You can get memory for around a dollar per megabyte!  I use the internal 2mb memory as a back-up if I fill up my compact flash cards.  I have 4 addt'l cards.  I never imagined that I would prefer this camera over my traditional point and shoot film cameras. However, the ease of use, the LCD preview screen, the no developing expense, and the fun of making cards, stickers, calendars, web pages, etc. make it a no-brainer.  Don't like a shot?  Erase it!  The quality of photos is decent-3 settings. 2x zoom is a must for some shots.  Maybe my expectations were low because I tried the Polaroid Digital I-Zone and it was quickly returned.  I'm telling you, everyone who has tried this camera loves it.  Don't expect it to be as sharp or as perfect as traditional for this price or the 1.3 megapixel.  It is simply a fun all-around camera.  It goes with us everywhere!  I'm buying one for my nephew at even a better price!  Software included with camera is pretty useless, but there are many affordable if not free ones out there to use!  Have a blast in the digital world without spending a fortune.
