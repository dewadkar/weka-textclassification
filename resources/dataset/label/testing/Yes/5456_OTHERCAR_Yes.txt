            I had this car from 1995 to 1998.  It was the LS with black exterior and a tan interior.

The car came loaded with power everything and air conditioning.  The seat adjustments are manual and I had not CD player or aluminium rims.

The car rides low to the ground but gives you and excellent view because of its large windshield and rear hatchback window.  The exterior styling was unique in its day and got many looks.  The quality was of course excellent, as are all Acura models.  The seat position and tilt steering makes for a comfortable ride.  This car does encourage racing but forget about racing when the air conditioner is on because it sucks all the power out of your 4 cylinder engine.  The A/C is pretty strong but I recommend tinting the rear windows since they let a lot of sun in.  I also recommend fog lights but since you ride so low to the ground they are not a necessity.

I took this car up to around 115 mph and it fealt like I was going 70.  I wouldn't recommend high speeds during wet conditions or snow because it's a light car and does tend to be pushed around by high winds and does hydroplane and slide around on snow pretty easily.  You can put a few sand bags in the trunk to help you out.

I never needed major warranty work on this car.  I did have a problem with the ABS brakes, they kept coming on even at low speeds and during light breaking.  This problem was intermittent but enough to take me to the dealer.  They didn't find anything wrong with it and of course could not duplicate the problem during their testing.  The problem returned a mile away from the dealer (big surprise).  Acura dealers are friendly and professional but they do tend to be a little snobby.  Don't even try to get a loaner car, at least not if you're under 30 years old.  The ABS problem dissapeared on its own, so did an alarm problem that I had (the alarm would come on when I was parked at a red light...great attention grabber).

ACCIDENT:  I'm going to describe the biggest accident I had with this car (I did have a small fender bender before this but it was minor).  I was driving down the parkway on Long Island during a rainy night.  I was going about 55mph when I drove over a water drain which was at the bottom of a bump in the road.  This caused the wheel to turn right and caused me to overadjust.  Like I said the car is light on its feet, so it started turning to the right and before I knew it I was going down the highway sideways.  The car was sliding down the road backwards now and got on the grass.  The brakes were useless at this time and I had no training in recovering from this.  The car turned around and crashed front first into the wall of the overpass after missing those big sand filled barrels that are supposed to keep you safe.

Both airbags deployed sending out the worst smell you will ever smell in your life.  I never touched the airbag with my face because the seatbelt held me back and I sit pretty far from the wheel.  The airbags burned my wrists and I still don't know where my watch went.  The engine turned off but the radio was still on.  I opened the window and got out of it because the door was being blocked by the barrels.  To my surprised I stepped on my rear window which had flown COMPLETELY OFF the rear of the car and landed next to my door!!!  Luckily the tint film held the glass together so the shattered pieces didn't get to me (always tint your rear window if you have this car, even if its clear tint!!!)

My knee did hit the bottom dash but the area was padded and it was only sore for a day or two.  The front was crushed and the airbags would have done their job had I needed them.  The transmission cracked and the frame bent so that added to the cost of repairs.  Not to mention the cost of the rear window and airbags!

Obviously I'm still alive so the car did keep me safe.  The reason my arms hurt was because I made the mistake of tightening up during the collision, which is not good.  It took 5 weeks and over $11,000 to repair everything, which didn't help my insurance premium.  Insurance rates for this car were already a little above average.
