            I bought a sc saturn coupe in 1998 for the most part its a great car. I feel like a can depend on it, I haven't had to do any repairs. I mainly bought this car because doing my homework I learned that saturn had the least service repairs, and also the price is set and you don't have to argue with those salesmen. There are a few minor details that could be worked on. When on the highway you can hear the road pavement and air coming through the door. When you open your window, not all the way the air coming from the door handle, was a surprise to me, it can get quite drafty if your a smoker! <br><br>
