            I was in the market for compact car and wanted something different at the same time the New Beetle was just released on the market.  So I bought one on impulse, driving it for the first time after I bought it.

The car's a blast to drive.  It's quick and nimble but the stock radio has to go.  It ruins the moment.  Also when driving through corners or in parking lots, the front pillar on the drivers side takes some getting used too.  I'd wish those visers worked properly too.  Oh they do! I can see myself in the vanity mirror.  Note to self... wear sun glasses on a clear sunny day!

The sitting position up front is upright and comfortable with plenty of head room.  But not much for tall passengers(over 5'10&quot;) in the back seat, unless they have a slouching problem or like to hit the back of their heads with glass.  Also, If you have that habit of reaching out across the dashboard to see if the defrost is working this car will help you break it.  You could land a plane on it.  

Trunk space is average but if you need more room just fold down the back seat.  Got it?

I took it back for the recalls and had the problems corrected if needed.  I also had a problem with the coolant light.  They found it was just a loose wire.  For the do it your selfers, forget about doing any work on the backside of the engine, because it's almost located at the back of the car just like the original, but you can't reach it from there. 

Other than that this car has done me good.  It's the most pleasurable car I've ever driven.  Because of that alone, I recommend to treat yourself to test drive one even if your aren't going to buy it.  It's worth the hassle.  Have fun, you deserve it!!
