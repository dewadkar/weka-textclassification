            I purchased this vehicle after my Toyota Previa Van was totaled in an accident.  I liked the styling and decided to take it for a test drive.  I test drove many SUVs during the time I was looking for a vehicle and found this one to drive the smoothest, it drives like a car with the feel of a truck.  It fits my family of six with ease.  The only thing I do not like about the Durango is the gas mileage I drive 40 miles one way to work and the Durango gets only about 15 miles to the gallon.  The V8 pulls my 24 ft pontoon boat with ease, even going up the steepest boat ramps. Whether you need this vehicle to pull your boat or take your family out for a drive the Durango is positively perfect<br><br>
