            My wife decided to downgrade vehicles, or so we thought. She was ready to sell/trade her 97 Cherokee for something less expensive to drive and get rid of a car payment. Our favorite car dealer (Chip Wynn Buick/Jeep) had just traded for a 93 Accord SE. One look and drive and we were sold. 

The vehicle has 135,000 miles on the odometer, but if you couldn't see the numbers, you would swear it is 4-5 years newer.  

There were no options available for this model when new. Leather seats, power moon roof, 4 wheel disc brakes, power everything, cruise, Bose sound system, etc.  It was all there. 

It drives like new, handles great, averages 24 mpg, is very quiet and is most comfortable to travel in.  My wife likes the great all round visibility from inside. The hood slopes down allowing you to see very close in front.

As if one wasn't enough, we were in the market for a newer vehicle for my son who was driving an 88 Cherokee.  We ran up on a '93 Accord LX on a used car lot and knowing what we did about the SE, gave it a test drive.

Although it has 145,000 miles, it actually felt tighter than the SE. No leather seats or moon roof, but entirely adequate. LX averages 26 mpg.

We have driven them both now for 6-8 months and have never regretted our decision. Both use no oil and have had no mechanical problems. Heat and AC are powerful. Paint and finish are excellent on both. SE is cashmere and the LX is dark green. We have gotten many compliments on the SE. A very classy looking vehicle.

The only complaint we have is the drivers side window does not seem to follow the track sometimes when raising it and will leave a small gap at the top back corner. I feel it is just a matter of adjustment, but have not taken it to the dealer yet. It is not a major problem or I would have taken it in already.

We paid $5000 for the SE and $3200 for the LX. 

I would not hesitate to buy another used Honda if these two are typical representations.
