            The Jeep Cherokee Sport is a great Truck for the money.  It's especially great in the snow.  It is so rugged.  I feel bad when I see people having trouble in the snow - whether its with pulling out of a parking spot, or pulling into a parking spot.  That is when i most thankful that I have a Jeep.

If u like a rugged vehicle, you'll love this SUV.  You can actually feel the bumps your rolling over.  There's no such thing as a smooth drive in this truck.  But it's great!

It's a great car for the lease rate.  I'm currently leasing it for a little under $300 per month on a 36 month lease.  Jeep almost always offers their trucks with no money down.  So they don't rip you off when you tell them that you don't want to put any money down.  

This SUV is a great buy.  The only disadvantage that it has is that there's not much room to breath in the back.  But it's ok if you're in the front.  

It's a great car if you're someone with a small budget to work with.<br><br>
