            We bought the Lhs used and problems have been minimal! The seats are more comfortable than my friends 00' deville! It gets better gas mileage than any car I have ever owned, and it is a large luxury vehicle! It easily accomadates 6 passangers if you dont have the floor shifter option! Keyless entry comes in handy, also with power trunk release! Overhead console is very useful, included temp, direction, mpg, avg mpg, trip odometer, distance til empty, time vehicle has ran sice last reset! The leather is plush and very very comfortable! Engine moves it along incredible well! The 3.5 chrysler engine is also found in the Prowler! The trunk is large and space for a family of 5's luggage for a 7 day trip to the beach! Info center is helpful on simpl things, that you dont have to look under the hood for, low washer fluid ect! Also the traction control comes in very handy here in northern Indiana! Service engine soon light came on all the time, dealer said it can be triggered by almost anything, including a loose gas cap and so on! The dimming lights add to luxury! Wood trim seems like it is plastic, it may be! But from a birds eye view adds a luxurious look! Doors arm wrests make a plastic cracking noise all the time, but it isnt cracking! Stereo sounds like an aftermarket one, the standard stereo is an infinity system and bumps very well! Two cupholders in front are a plus, but dont hold much larger than a 32 ounce! Air conditioning works well, but there is always a stench when I first turn it on! The antenna built into the window picks up more than a regular one, or so it seems! Climate control works great! The cockpit is quite when the engine is turned on, sometimes I even forget it is on! Steering wheel is rather small, and could be more full and plush like the lincolns and cadillacs!
