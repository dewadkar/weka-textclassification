            I had a smaller camera and it had its good points in that I could place it in a pocket. Expect a much lighter version of a SLR camera. I find it very light and for that reason always use the strap (to prevent dropping it). The picture quality is superb. The sharpness is incredible.
I purchased this camera because of the low cost of storage
and the ease to transfer the 8cm CD's directly onto any computer! I buy the cdrw cd's so I can use them over and over again. Once you finalize the CDR's you can not take any more photographs.
I was disappointed that there is no viewfinder and you must use the LCD monitor to take all your photos. The other disappointment was the low battery life. However, the biggest disappointment is the shutter delay of approx. 3 seconds. You have to predict WHAT your subjects are going to do, particulary children and animals. I find this very annoying. I had another digital camera which did not have this delay. It does have a great lens and you can photograph
items such as a flower and get clear, flawless features.
The model is in a SLR body so it is somewhat heavier then the average digital camera. I like the fact that you can add on a telephoto lens and you can purchase an external viewfinder. I find that I have to take lots and lots of pictures because of the 3 second delay, however with the capacity to hold 1000  pics one can always go back and delete the photos that they do not like. I would suggest this camera for someone who is SERIOUS about photographs and can figure out the manual mode. The most important thing about this camera---You MUST read the manual. After spending two weeks using this camera on vacation I have found the convenience of putting the CD's in the adapter of a computer worth it. I would have bought the lower pixel model at a lower price because the photos come out great at even a 2 megapixel setting. I rarely use the 4 megapixel. It's nice to know you have it if you need it though.
