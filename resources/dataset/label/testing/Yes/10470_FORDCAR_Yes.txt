            I have an automatic 4.0L, 4x4, extended cab, with a tow bar installed.  I can't say enough about it.  It has been a great truck the whole time I've owned it. 

My husband built a huge car trailer and we hauled a car and a truck (1 at a time) from Maryland to North Carolina (6 hours) with no problem at all.  It was in the heat of the summer and the truck did not over heat.  Needless to say, we exceeded the weight capacity that was recommended, but didn't have any trouble.  It was a little slow pulling up the steep hills in MD, but we made it. 

I'm not getting as good gas mileage that I did when I first bought the truck.  I usually get around 17 miles a gallon and that is around town, and 19 miles a gallon on a trip.

The 4 wheel drive works well.  I've only used it in the snow, and I've never gotten stuck.  All you need to do to engage the 4-wheel drive is push a button.  This can be done while you are moving, but you should be going under 25 mph.  To disengage you just push the button then backup 8 feet and you'll hear the gearbox click.  BEWARE, when you disengage the 4-wheel drive, you will not be able to re-engage it until you backup.  I made this mistake once.  I was on a back road and the road was snow covered so I was in 4-wheel drive, I turned onto the entrance ramp to the freeway and disengaged the 4-wheel drive. (It is strongly suggested not to drive in 4-wheel drive while on dry roads)  As I drove further up the interstate the roads became totally covered again and the truck started to fish tail so I tried to put it back in 4-wheel dry, and it just wouldn't go.  Imagine my surprise!  It was slow going simply because the truck doesn't go anywhere in 2-wheel drive when you have no weight in the back to help out.

I've never had any trouble with the vehicle and I now have approximately 80,000 miles on it.  The extended cab has 1 seat on each side, which is good for children, but a little uncomfortable, for adults...will do for a short ride though.  The seats up front are comfortable as long as you're only sitting in them for 45 minutes, otherwise they are a killer!!  My back starts aching and I end up putting something behind my back to help it out.
