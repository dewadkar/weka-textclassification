            I was in the market for something sporty under 30K, and when looking at Mazda I had decided that my choices were limited to the RX-8 and the Miata. 

That changed when I test drove a Mazda 6S.

<b>Value:</b>

The most appealing thing about this car right off the bat was that the starting price was around 21k! This meant that I could add as many options as my heart desired and I would never reach 30K. 

<b>Performance:</b>

But can it move? It reaches 60 in 6.8 and runs a mid 15 quarter mile. Good numbers for a stock car at 21k. It comes with a satisfying 220HP 3.0L V6 that makes near 200 ft lb of torque at 5k RPM. When you couple that with a manual transmission, you will find yourself at risk for speeding tickets more often than you'd expect as it is very easy to go fast in this car. 

The 6 handles itself with grace. It comes alive around corners and can often put a smile on your face when you're hugging a tight curve. Even though this car is fairly heavy at 3300 lb, body roll is less noticeable than one would imagine. Steering is VERY responsive at high speeds, almost too excitable sometimes as it feels very light on its feet and eager to change direction. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on driver preference.

<b>Styling:</b>

The exterior styling is amongst the most attractive i've seen for a car in this price range ever. It looks hot, and, in my case with my black 6 - adding a body kit and sport grille, 30% all around tint, euro lights, 18 inch wheels and lowering the car a few inches makes this thing look real slick - especially when coming out of a car wash. 

<b>Features:</b>

As i mentioned, I was able to load this car with Bose Audio, 6 CD changer, Heated seats, sport grille, body kit, spoiler, leather seating and more - without coming anywhere near 30k. and the standard features were more than plentiful for the casual driver. The only major option I didn't get was a moonroof. 

The interior dash is laid out in a very accessible way (radio/CD controls are on both the steering wheel and the center console). A minor gripe I had is the abundance of titanium finish, but I managed to offset that with a few chrome and carbon fiber fixtures and trim pieces. All in all the quality of the interior is comparable to cars in higher classes, but at the same time the design may be interpreted as sportier and less mature. 

<b>The Competition:</b>

I test drove the new accord and camry V6 models - the Accord is slightly faster than the 6 off the line but not nearly as fun to drive and without some key features (not to mention the fact that every human being on planet earth drives an accord). The Camry is way too family-oriented (BORING). It didn't even have  manual transmission as an option. The Altima is faster than this car, but only the 3.5SE - and that can get pricey with the options i'd want (around 28k). Plus, the altima just looks too bloated for my taste, and the interior trim levels are disappointing for a car of that price. 

<b>Utility:</b>

With folding 60/40 rear seats, a HUGE trunk and 96 cubic feet of interior space, this car is great for hauling friends and family around - which was a major factor in my buying decision. Often times its hard to find a sporty sedan that can be used for moving people around comfortably, but the 6 is great for that purpose. 

<b>Downside?</b>

The only downside with this car is that the aftermarket is lacking with performance upgrades since the 6 is a relative newcomer to the tuner scene. 6 owners see that changing within the not too distant future. 

Also, I do not vouch for the 6i or the 6s automatic trans. I test drove the 6S automatic and there was a significant throttle response delay problem. Not to mention that a manual tranny is the only way to drive a sports car :)

All in all this car was worth its price and more.
