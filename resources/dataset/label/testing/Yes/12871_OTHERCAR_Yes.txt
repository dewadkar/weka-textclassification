            Infinity J30 is built in 210 horse powers V-6, 3.0 liter engine.  this vehicle is relatively small, but has lots of horse power, which will give you good acceleration.  I bought 1995 Infinity J30 because of its power although it is a luxury sedan.  I really like the acceleration.  Also this model comes with nice options.  It has CD player with Bose speaker system, front power seats, front heating seats, all leather seats, air conditioning (of course), sliding sun roof, power steering, tilt steering, 4-speed automatic transmission. 
J30 has the same engine as Nissan 300ZX.  Therefore, not like other luxury sedans, it is little bit noisy while you are driving J-30.  Since it has 3.0 liter engine it takes relatively a lot of gas. (I used spend 30 bucks for the gas each week)
I recommend this car to people who wants luxury sedans and speed at the same time.  If you can stand with bit of loudness of the engine, J30 will be a perfect car for you.
