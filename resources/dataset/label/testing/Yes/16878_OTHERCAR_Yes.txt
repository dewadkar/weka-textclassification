            My 1992 Range Rover and I have one thing in common, we were both "born" in Solihull, England.  I bought mine new from the dealership in Houston in August 1992 and so far it has nearly 90,000 miles on the odometer.  It is a "stripped down" version with less wood trim, no airbags and no roll bars and this made it affordable at around $34,000.

One of the more unique points about the Range Rover is the driving position and the incredible view over the road ahead.  This helps to make the Range Rover a safe vehicle to drive regardless of the fact that it lacks ABS, airbags, etc.  However, I am aware that the Range Rover can turn over, having seen a few wrecks, and I think it important to recognize that this is not a sports car even though it can be driven quite fast on the freeways!

The handling off-road is incredible.  Unlike most Range Rovers mine has spent considerable time off road.  Three locations come to mind, each one different:

South Padre Island National Seashore, Texas - ever changing beach sands that a vehicle can sink in to its axles just like that.  I have pulled others out of trouble here but never had a problem myself.

San Juan Mountains, Colorado.  The so-called mining "jeep" trails are a lot of fun if you have a good 4-wheel drive vehicle.  Some of these trails sort the men from the boys and the Range Rover is definitely grown up!

Big Bend National Park, Texas.  Remote trails, subject to flash floods, need high clearance at least, but doing them in style requires a Range Rover!  The tailgate makes a great primitive campground accessory.

Reliability is the potential downside to any Range Rover.  It is built in Britain, after all.  My greatest problem has been with the alternator.  I've had five, with the latest one an Italian unit that is promising to live up to its high cost and warranty.  Then it's all the little things, like the switch that controls each seat movement - they are expensive to replace.

So is the Range Rover worth it?  An unqualified Yes!

But I would not replace mine with a new one - they are too expensive and sophisticated for me.  And I simply don't like the Discovery even if it shares the same underpinnings.

Finally, let me explain that I called my Range Rover the Lode Lane Legend after the factory address.
