            We bought a new Blazer in 1996 and I love it.  It has very comfortable front and back seats, unlike some of the other SUV's we tried.  It has room in the back seat to fit 3 people or even 2 carseats and a person.  The back storage area always carries 2 strollers and plenty of other items.  We really have enjoyed this Blazer and once our other cars does we will own 2 Blazers.  We have never had any problems with it at all.  We get the oil changed every 2000 to 2500 miles and take really good care of it. It gets about 18 to 20 miles a gallon.  Lately with the gas prices going up the way they are it has cost me almost $30 to fill it up where normally it takes about $20 or a little less.  Still worth it.<br><br>
