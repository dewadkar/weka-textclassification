            My mother in law had purchased the camera before she married my father in law.  They both had two of the same camera so they gave my husband and I this camera.  It was wonderful!  We had it for about a year. 

It came with the plug in, the software, the cords for the computer, and the case and screen.  The camera would zoom automatically or manually.  Flash automaticly or manualy.  It also had a button to take action pictures.  We used it so much.

The memory card was nice since it was easy to erase and start over.  It was stolen from us this past weekend so we no longer have it.  But we would recommend it to everyone!<br><br>
