            Hmmm... Where to start?

     I have been a VW fan for a long time. I currently own 3 of them! (Passat, 85 Golf, 1971 Transporter [bus]). But it's not my liking for VW that attracted me to the Passat. 
     
     With the introduction of the greatly improved 1998 Passat, VW wowed critics around the globe. This car was excellent. Just do a search at carpoint.com or edmunds.com or even here. Well, the 2001.5 or 2002 basically is that impressive car- made better!
    
     A facelifted front and snazzy taillights give the 2002 Passat a more upscale look. VW boasts over 2000 changes in this updated model year from the previous 1998-2001 style. Some included updates are: more rigid body frame for a more solid feel, improved cupholders (believe me! these are much better than previous ones), more powerful base engine, and the list goes on. See vw.com for complete list.
  
     Basically VW listened to it's customers when it did this model update in 2001.5. The minor things that 1998-2001 Passat owners would have changed about their cars- VW did with the 2001.5/2002 models. Mainly the cupholders!
  
     This is an incredible car for the money. Especially in the base model with it's award winning 1.8 liter Turbo 4 cylinder engine- the same one used in the Audi A4 and Audi TT just with the electronically controlled turbo tuned differently. 

VW doesn't have very many option packages, because everything you'd want on your car is standard. A base model Passat has remote entry, power locks/windows, ABS, Anti Slip Regulation (ASR), Pwer steering, and the list goes on. Option packages are Luxury Package (Sunroof, Alloy Wheels, rear sunshade), Leather Package (leather seating, heated seats), Monsoon Stereo upgrade (upgraded stereo and speakers, and choice of 1.8T engine (now with an increased 180 horses) or V6 (a smoother 190 horses). 

I personally chose the Luxury Package with monsoon and the 1.8T engine (Color: FRESCO GREEN). It's a fun engine with plenty of "pep" and the ability to be "chipped" with aftermarket accessories (easily have over 200HP- just check with dealer first to avoid any warranty conflicts!) 

Gas mileage is excellent- upper 20s average. About 30 on the highway. The V6 is a good engine as well. It's quieter, smoother, and some people like that better. But with only 10 horses difference, for me the price wasn't worth it. You also have a choice of standard or 5 speed Tiptronic Auto Transmissions. 

I chose the 5 speed standard (the Passat is about the only "family sedan" still available with standard trans. and it does feel sporty!) I have driven the Tiptronic transmission as well. It is very nice. Designed by Porsche. It allowed you to either drive in Automatic or upshift or downshift "clutchlessly" by tapping the gear shift up or down. It is very smooth, but I like the whole clutch and 5 speed thing. Just a personal taste. 

Tiptronic adds another $1500 or so. I'm not talking too much pricewise in this review, because so much of that info is widely available on the internet now. Be sure to check kbb.com (Kelley Blue Book), edmunds.com (an excellent resource of info), and carpoint.com, (MSN's auto site).
 

Some might say, "The Passat is more expensive than other sedans in it's class." Well, try comparing the "other sedans" with all the same options that the Passat has STANDARD. And that's only talking options people. That doesn't take into account that the Passat is just a fun car to drive. Much more interesting than the Japanese sedans that are so popular.

 I look for an excuse to take my Passat somewhere. Wife needs something from the store? SURE I'll go get it for you! Ordering pizza? Naw, I'll just pick it up- don't have them deliver! This is a driver's car.
 
It has high quality interior materials. Comparable to other "luxury German autos" like BMW.  

Comfortable seats with many adjustment capabilities. Abundant legroom in both front and rear. Headroom galore (even more with out the sunroof!). 

More saftey features than you could shake a stick at. 
Dual front airbags, side airbags, side curtain air bags, anti lock brakes, anti slip regulation, etc. 

And anti theft technology similar to Mercedes Benz automobiles. Laser cut keys that are impossible to duplicate (except through dealer if you ever lose your key- don't worry about that! :) The key by the way is "way cool!" A switchblade key. Your remote for lock/unlock doors and trunk are part of the key. The actual key part flips out of the small rectangular remote. Really cool and fits in your pocket more comfortably.
 
Speaking of the key... There are a few nice features of this high-tech key. It's impossible to steal a Passat unless you have this key. There is a computer chip embedded inside the key that disarms the theft deterrent system. Without that in place, the car is completely disabled! Also a neat little trick is being able to roll down or up all of the windows with the key inserted in the door and then held in the turned position (either hold turned left to roll down or right to roll up.) Nice feature if you forget to roll up your windows (or sunroof - works on that too) or if it's really hot inside your car and you'd like some of that hot air to clear out before you get in.

 I could go on and on about neat little "thoughtful" things VW has put into it's flagship sedan. But I think I'll end soon. VW has produced a superior automobile in the 2002 Passat and is constantly moving their whole product line upscale. 

With a 8 cylinder Passat coming soon and eventually a larger sedan to compete more directly with BMW's and Mercedes's larger sedans. 

This company [VW] is going places people. Jump on the bandwagon while you can and cash in on a superior car at an affordable price.
