            I received this camera as a gift and as gifts go, this one was tops!  I had been wanting a digital camera and this one filled the bill to a certain point. 

I have never been one to read those horribly boring instruction manuals so of course I bumbled around with the camera until I learned everything there was to know and thankfully it was incredibly simple. 

I used the camera all the time and still do on occasion when I just want to snap a couple quickie images.  Just pick your target, set a button for distance from your subject, pick the resolution, and choose whether or not you want a flash. I generally just leave it on auto flash. View your picture LCD window and decide whether to keep it or trash it with a simple menu screen. 

The software that you get with the camera makes uploading to your PC a breeze.  With the software you can edit and manipulate your images like a pro without knowing the first thing about graphics. If you are a decent graphic artist I would definitely suggest editing your photos in other programs like Adobe Photoshop because the software included in this package is strictly beginner material. Save your uploaded photos in albums or select folders and you are done. 

The problems I encountered with this camera are that printed photos are generally poor in quality because this is not a mega pixel camera so most of the images that I have had printed from sites like Shutterfly have come back either off-color or slightly blurred.  NO you cannot blame the photographer for these errors.  I am sure it was the camera because I uploaded the images in high resolution straight from the camera to their servers without editing the materials. 

Of course like other digital cameras, there is also the issue of battery drainage so use the adapter over batteries as much as possible, especially when uploading the images to your PC. 

Overall this is a great buy for the beginner but a not-so-hot purchase for the avid photographer or graphic designer.
