            The Toyota Corolla is a great car to own if you are on a budget or you look for anonymity when purchasing a car or you don't need a whole lot of space, power, luxury, or pinache in your car.

The design is nice, but is forgetable.  Nothing anywhere on the car would cause an outburst of protest from car people due to its radical-ness.  It is a design which upsets no one, but that means that it is difficult to become passionate or headstrong about it, either way.  

Functionally, it has decent dimensions granted you don't have a large family or plan on carting around adults in the backseats for a long time. This car works well for a young family or a single person (or just as easily a person from a large, old family who will be the only person to use it).  

As far as the way it drives, again, this car will not excite too many people, but it will also not disappoint.  It has good pick-up and handling but it is not spine-tingling.  The ride is very smooth yet not so much so you feel like you are floating in mid-air.  The seats are comfortable up front, yet the back seats are more firm and have less support.

The model I have is an LE, which comes standard with dual airbags, a cassette stereo, air conditioning, power door locks and windows, a 60/40 split rear seat, and body-colored rear-view mirrors and door handles and nicer looking wheel covers.  It is well packaged for the price, but you don't get a lot of nicer extras like remote keyless entry or alloy wheels, both of which are usually seen on most models' top trim line.

The reliability of a Corolla is never an area of concern.  Corollas are just reliable cars.  It has a good warranty, but it won't be used too often.  You will have as many problems with a Corolla for its entire life as Homer Simpson has hairs on his head.  (I must warn you that this is not a guaranteed number.)

Everything this car needs to do, it does well.  Plus, it is in the price range for the people who need this sort of car to be able to afford it.  An important thing to remember is that this car does everything well, but never does it really do anything exceptionally.<br><br>
