            I bought my 1997 Integra used, with over 30,000 miles already on it.  After years of driving a lot, I have put almost 70,000 miles on it and it drives like the day I gotit. I love this car! ALthough it is small and the backseat is too small if you have kids, it is perfect for someone looking for a safe yet sport car. I have not had one problem with it yet. As long as this car keeps on driving the way it does now, I have no desire to get rid of it. The Integra is very affordable for somebody who does not want to pay more that $20,000 for a nice new car. I have driven other cars that are also "sporty" (like the Mustang) and I believe that nothing drives as well as the Acura Integra.
