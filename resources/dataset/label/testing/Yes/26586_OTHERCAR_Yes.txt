            Coming out of a 1995 Pathfinder, with a weak 153 horsepower engine and without airbags, it was a welcome feel to sit inside a 2003 4Runner; I got the V-8 Sport Edition 4x4 and not just because of the new-car smell. 

There's more room. Smooth car-like ride without losing its truck ruggedness. At 36.7 feet it has one of the tightest turning radii of most mid-size utilities - welcome change from my Pathfinder's 45-foot turning radius. While I didn't get side airbags (limited availability when I bought it), the driver/front passenger airbags do just fine. Plus the 4-wheel drive system in this 4Runner is full-time, providing traction all the time.

The 2004 models are available with third row seating (not Sport Edition trim though) but when you get the seats, you cannot get some options (i.e. 360-watt JBL system), and don't expect to have any cargo space left with the third row seats set back up.

Yes, a V-6 is offered, but fuel economy may be only a little better than the V-8. Plus, there's still a few quirks to be worked out from the V-6 which is relatively only a year old. The V-8 has had a bulletproof reputation so far. I've heard no one having problems with the V-8 when it first came out in the Tundra. 235 HP and 320 pound feet of torque beats 153 HP and 180 pound-feet from the Pathfinder. Power delivery is luxury car smooth and for good reason - the engine is based from the V-8 used in some Lexus models.

When it comes to Toyota quality, it is. Initial quality is superb. No problems so far after more than 3-4 months and at 6000 miles. I had few problems with the Pathfinder - and it's a Nissan - over 8 years of ownership and I don't expect to find anything out of the ordinary from this 4Runner.
