             just got back from a trip to Ft.Worth for the Holidays. 
I was given a new 2003 Lincoln LS by the Hilton I was staying at to drive around in for the week. 

I am in love with the ride. 

First off I found the mileage to be impressive. We spent entire days driving around the Dallas Ft.Worth area - getting lost quite frequently because we were so unfamiliar with the lay of the land. It took a whole week before we ran out of gas. The tank held 20 gallons and a digital dashboard unit kept us informed of the gallons left in the tank. 

I haven't had a Lincoln since about 1998 - and I felt instantly at home with the console and layout of the dashboard. Very Ergonomic - Very user friendly. In fact as soon as your key is in the ignition - the drivers side seat immediately returns to the previous drivers desired position and posture. When you take the key out - the seat slides back-wards smoothly so as to provide more legroom for exiting. 

Since we got lost a few times, we found ourselves on back roads and crossing bad streets. Because this was a 'free' car for us, we decided to test the shocks - racing 40 - 50 mph over train tracks and potholes. 

Didn't feel a thing - the ride on this car is amazing. 

It handles well too. Even though It is not considered a compact car by any means - it is still a bit smaller than its Continental predecessors - Yet I found myself zipping in and out of traffic lanes - tight holiday shopping parking lots - and parallel parking with the greatest of ease. 

And trunk space! Whoa buddy - you could hide bodies in that trunk! We weren't traveling with any bodies though - more like 4 grown women and their bewildering amount of a weeks worth of luggage each. Plenty of room -- and the trunk served us well while we hit those malls as well. Very pleasing. 

There is temperature control for both the front and the back of the car. So no waiting for that heat to get to the back seat. 

The stereo sound wasn't too bad either. 

Second to the incredible comfort and smoothness of the ride and the cars exquisite handling - I would have to say I am most impressed with the layout of everything a driver need be concerned with. Dashboard controls, shifting, lights, wiper, stereo - its all laid out so well that after not having ridden in a Lincoln for close to five years - It fit like an old glove. An old shiny new leather interior glove with a big trunk. :)
