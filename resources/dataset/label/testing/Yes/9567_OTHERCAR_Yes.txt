            I have owned quite a few cars, and driven many more, so when it came to replacing my Ford Probe (which is really a Mazda MX6 in Ford clothing), I wanted something that felt at least as good on the road.

The Celica just had that little bit extra when I did test drives of various makes and models, and always had the edge.

My primary concern when I look for a car is how I feel in the driver's seat, and how this transmits back through the car to the road, and vice versa. I want to "feel" where I am, and I want to "feel" what the car is doing. In a nutshell, I want to feel like I am a part of the car.

The Celica comes very close to how it felt driving my BMW a few years back. Even though the Celica has front wheel drive, it has a very similar feel in handling to rear wheel drive cars. The BMW was very well balanced, with a low centre of gravity, and the Celica closely echoes those memories.

Also, the Celica pretty much goes where you point it. Even in a tight curve, at speed, changing your line usually has the car responding happily and without complaint. That is exactly what I want in a car, and I only have the GT. The car does not wallow in a tight curve, but sits down nicely, and tries to do exactly what you want it to.

It is very snappy in traffic, and as long as you keep the revs up, will dive into any gap you ask it to. The steering is direct, and very responsive, without being twitchy.

Roadholding is excellent, and the car always seems to have a surefooted, positive feel to it, even when it creeps up to 100 mph. That is one of its downsides, if you can call it that. The handling is so good, that out on the freeway, often without realising it, you can find yourself at 80, 90, or even 100 mph with little effort on your part. You might want to search the net for a good radar detector!!

Easing up to overtake another vehicle often leaves you running 10 or more mph faster than you started out, and it seems like you did nothing to get there. The feel is absolutely smooth.

My Probe had excellent all round vision. In fact, you had to drive it for a while and then climb into another car to immediately realise how spoilt you were in the Probe. The Celica falls somewhat short in this department. The rear pillars are bulky and obscure vision if you turn your head back to check those critical blindspots.

The Celica also came with the factory fitted spoiler, and this is another bad mark for the design. I am 5' 9" tall, and when I sit in the driver's seat and look in the interior rearview mirror, the spoiler sits right across the front of any car behind me. If the car is 100 yards or more behind me, it is often mostly obscured by the spoiler.

On the plus side, the spoiler does tend to block headlights of closer cars at night, but that also can be a bad thing, because I usually look for those lights to let me know where other cars are.

However, the car is so snappy, and runs so well, that often you aren't as much concerned about what is going to pass you, as you are about what is up ahead that you will be passing.

I never tested this car in the automatic version, and don't believe you should waste your time mixing the two. This car was designed to respond to revs, and the only way to control that, is with a stick shift. Keep the revs up and the Celica will surprise you with its performance.

Now for the cosmetics. The cockpit is very comfortable. The seat holds you nicely and helps to make you feel part of the car. The controls are well placed, and most of them can be reached without even leaning slightly out of your seat. Very nice when you have your eyes on the road.

There is a storage compartment under the armrest between the two front seats that can hold CD's etc. The doors each have limited storage space in them, but the one I think is really neat is the storage compartment in the dash above the radio. Its very handy for sunglasses, spare pen, notepad etc.

I always wear a seatbelt, and this shows up the other small fault in the Celica. I had the habit of releasing the seatbelt and letting it swing back to the side, and this usually causes the buckle to hit the side panel behind my shoulder. Bad news!!  The plastic is relatively brittle, and very quickly starts to show small scuffs and chips.

You will have to learn to catch the seatbelt buckle with your arm and ease it back, or your door panel is going to end up looking really chewed up.

Don't buy this car if you want a family saloon. It was never designed as that, and anyone who complains about the limited space in the back seats has their priorities mixed up. 

Neither is it a pickup truck. The trunk has more than adequate room for normal use by two people and will easily hold all reasonable luggage for two on a trip. The split fold down rear seats also allow for that extra space when you insist on trying to use it for something other than sporty hot wheels.

You will certainly be able to find better cars than this out there. You will certainly pay a lot more money for them too. But when it comes to dollars for fun, you will be hard pressed to beat the Celica.
