            I bought my 1989 GMC Jimmy a little over a year ago.  At the time, I was just looking for a beater, to get me to work and back so I could save money for a car I really wanted.  A family friend told me of a guy he knew that was selling his truck.  We went out and, to tell you the truth, I wasn't impressed right away, I took it for a test drive, and I still wasn't really impressed with its driving capabilities, such as acceleration, etc.  The price was a little more than I could afford, too. I took it anyway because of their notariety of being dependable, (I know several people with Blazers or Jimmies having more than 200,000 miles on them).  So I took it home.  I didnt really start to fall in love with it until I started to drive it more.  I was more used to smaller, faster coupes. Now, I don't know what I'd do without a truck, I've taken it camping, off-roading, it does great in the snow (Midwest winters are horrible), and the 4WD is impeccable.  
   This truck is amazingly dependable. Unfortunately, when I bought this, all the wear-and-tear had to be replaced all at once, such as; tires-$400, brakes-$300, battery-$90, serpentine belt-$90 and I also needed axle bearings and seals which were another $300.  But, it always takes me where I want to go, and it starts every time, and I've never had any major mechanical work on it, besides a new starter which I put in myself. 
    Being a teenager, I've done minor upgrades to it. I put in 2 10" Rockford Fosgate subwoofers and a 300 watt amp.  The CD player and 2 Pioneer 6"x9"'s were already in. I also dropped in a K&N air filter, which is a great investment. I put in a Tachometer, and I also shelled out $180 for a Flowmaster and new exhaust pipes.  Another good investment.  I also found a way to make a few horses and make my truck sound like a V-8 when floored, simply take the air filter cover and flip it over, so the filter is showing.  This gives you better gas mileage, too.  
    I have a good story about the solidness of this truck;  About a week after my senior year of highschool, I was rearended by a 1997 Chevrolet S-10 at about 30 mph.  I was hit so hard, the radio popped out of the dash.  I get out and I see a mangled front end and leaking fluids from the other truck, then I look at mine and I see a bent bumper and a little dent in the tailgate.  After the police officer came and took our names and everything, the other guy had to call a tow truck!  Mine was still drivable.  
   In the title you'll notice I said that this was a man's truck, and I mean it.  My truck has no cupholders, and no mirrors in the sunvisor, it has vinyl seats and floors, and the seats do not recline.  In fact, it is almost a base truck, all it has is the 4.3L V-6, Air-conditioning, a trip odometer, and 4WD, that is all, and it does what it is supposed to do.
I hope this review helps anyone in making a great decision:  BUY THIS TRUCK!
