            The Honda Accord has a little of everything making it the best overall car on the market today. It's no fluke that this car keeps making Car & Driver's Top 10 list. It's got the important safety features, room for 5 adults, can be driven like a family sedan or a sports car, well designed, solid, reliable, 

The Drive:
I love the look on the faces of other drivers when they realize they just got smoked by a family sedan. Unlike other family sedans like the Camry or Taurus, the Accord actually lets you have fun driving. It's not as fun as an M3 or a Boxster, but it's not trying to be. This is the car meant for the person who wants a safe car for their family, but still wants to have fun driving to work when there's no one else in the car. You can drive at 80mph and maneuver around other cars with complete confidence.

The Exterior:
The Accord may look conservative, but the nice thing about that is it doesn't look bad, and it'll never look out of style the way a lot of cars do after a few years. I happen to think the Accord looks pretty good, especially in black or red. The only problem is that the paint chips and scratches way too easily. A scratch remover helps, but close up there's still a lot of marks on it. The alloy wheels look good, although the newer model's wheels look better.

The Interior:
I can't think of a single car that has a dashboard that's better designed than the Accord. You don't have to read the manual to figure out which button does what. You don't have to stretch your arm to change the temperature or adjust the stereo. The seats are very comfortable. I once drove the Accord 6 hours straight and never got tired of sitting there. There's plenty of storage space, including two storage bins in the armrest, a deep glove compartment, and an open bin just under the stereo. I can fit 20 CDs in the armrest bin alone. In the back seat, there's a surprisingly good amount of leg room, the bench seat is flat making it easy to fit 3 adults, the seat folds down and has a pass through, and plenty of headroom. The stereo is pretty good considering it's a factory system. If you're looking for something better, either get a Lexus or an after-factory system. An Alpine system with 6 speakers, a CD player(a standard 6-disc changer after 2001), and steering wheel-mounted controls are pretty good for a family car. However, the few bad thing I can say about the interior is that the leather is cheap, the wood accents look fake, the grey interior should be lighter, the rearview mirror is too small, the rear armrest has cupholder that can't be hidden, and the dashboard lights are light green which doesn't look as good as the blue lights the old Hondas had. The orange needles might seem strange but look cool at night.

The Ride:
It may not be as smooth or quiet as a Lexus, but it's still pretty good. There's always a tradeoff between good roadholding and a smooth ride. Honda tends to be more European in its feel, making sure the driver feels connected to the road, largely because it uses Michelin tires, the best tires in the world. The downside to that is that bumps and road noise are more noticeable in the Accord. But it's a balance, smooth enough for everyday driving, but still offering enough grip to keep it fun to drive. And as for the noise, just turn the great stereo on and you won't notice. For long trips, this car is excellent because the seats are comfortable even after sitting in them for hours.

Safety:
The car has just almost all the safety features you'd want. Dual front and passenger airbags and ABS, front-wheel drive, child safety locks, and shoulder belts for every passenger. The only thing missing is Traction Control which is available starting 2001. It would be nice to have side-curtain airbags and rear passenger airbags but right now, you can only get those on premium luxury cars.
