            There is one thing I have always wanted to see happen in the auto business.  What happens if you take a mid-size sedan with a powerful engine, and cut off the back doors with a chainsaw?  Do you end up with a sports car?  The 2 door Accord is the living example of that experiment.  And, looking at its characteristics, we can see that it is a hybrid -- something between a sedan and a sports car.  The 2000 Accord is available in 4 different models, divided into 2 categories by the engine type.  There is the LX and EX, and then the LX V6 as well as the EX V6.  The model I had the pleasure of driving was the V6 Coupe.  

This is perhaps the only area in which the Accord will get a bad critization from me.  The two door Accord is not a bad looking car.  It looks quite classic, with round edges but an overall boxy figure.  Its too plain, and definitely not an eye catcher.  The winged 2 door versions steer towards the sporty look, but those thin tires and small exhaust pipes resemble the Civic a bit too much.  Overall, the 2 door Accord is a handsome car, but I wouldn't think of it as an attention catcher.  Slight exterior modifications need to be applied here.

There are two engines available for this hybrid.  First is a reliable 4cyl that produces 150HP.  The cylinder size is pretty big for a 4cyl at 2.3l, but its utterly overshadowed by the V6 model.    The 3.0l SOHC produces 200HP, 50 more than the 4cyl model.  With a 200lbs/ft of torque, the V6 model has more than enough power to haul its 3.2lbs body around.  Although a bit heavy, and slightly lacking in terms of torque, the V6 Accord is an exciting car, but I can't really say anything like that about the 4 cyl version.

The only new Accord I drew was the 2000 model.  Black EX, fully equiped with a spoiler and leather interior.  The car was a joy to drive, automatic tranny switching gears at a smooth and comfortable rate.  Unfortunately, the engine hadn't been broken in yet, so I didn't really gun it.  But I can usually tell if a car is powerful even at slow speeds, and Accord was able to prove its excitement factor.

The other Accord I have driven was a manual 94 model.  I don't know about the newer models, but the stick on the Accord is too soft.  Its not meant for hard driving and I felt that it would break if I pulled it hard enough.  Anyway, compared to the earlier model, the latest one was indeed a major improvement.  I seriously recommend it for anyone who is interested in buying a sporty car.<br><br>
