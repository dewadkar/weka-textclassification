            I have owned this car over 3 years now. It now has a little over 100,000 miles on it. The way it is running, I believe I can get another 50,000 or more miles out of it before any serious mechanical work is needed. It just keeps on running. Chevy did their homework when they came up with this one. All around great, reliable family vehicle for 2 adults and 2 kids. A bit hard on gas at 20 mpg but ample power. The reason I recommend not paying too much for a used Corsica is the trade in value. I thought of trading it in after 3 years on a newer car and my trade in price was only half of my purchase price in 3 years of driving only 20,000 miles. And this car is in excellent shape. So I have decided to keep my Corsica for a few more years since it is running so well. What amazed me is I have no body rust yet and I live in a winter salt area. I don't do any extra or special car washing either. Take it to the manual spray wash once every 2 or 3 months but I do spray in the door openings and under the hood. 
My only complaint is 2 parts: I tow a 15' travel trailer  approx. 80 miles on the highway maybe 10 times a year to go camping. At only 150 H.P. the car really works hard in the slightest head wind and any hill. Gas mileage really suffers as the pedal is 3/4 down most of the time to go 60 MPH. The second part is that the engine heats up towing to almost the red line in headwinds, and these engines are prone to intake gasket leaks. At these high temps the engine eats antifreeze occasionally requiring frequent top-ups. So my advice is, don't tow over 1000 lbs with this car as it simply is too much for the engine.
