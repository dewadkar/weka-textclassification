            	The Park Avenue is an extremely stylish ride.  It has a very strong, and well preforming V-6 engine, with traction control, heated seats, cruise, and many other often used options.  You'll turn heads as you cruise through town in the car of the millenium. (I made that name up myself).  I got this car last year and drive it almost every day.  I have never had a problem with it, and love its preformance.  The Park Avenue is the best luxury car that buick makes, and I think that everyone should be driving one.

	The Park Avenue isn't one of those old people cars, it's a very sporty looking and strong running car.  It has so many options there are to many to list.  The ride to Miami was OUTSTANDING, the seats are the most comfortable I've ever ridden in off of the lot.  There are cig. lighters in all of the ash trays, and an inside access to the trunk through the back seat.  There are so many things to tell about the Park Avenue, so go to a dealer and test drive one, even if you aren't going to buy one.<br><br>
