            ...if we did, we'd buy a SUV. But we don't have the budget to afford an SUV. So in March '99, we bought a 1998 Lumina. It had been a rental, but only had 14000 miles on it, and all the bells and whistles we like in a car. The ride is silky smooth and quiet, gas mileage isn't bad for a V6 (low 20's city, about 30 hwy). Roomy interior for 4 or 5 people and the trunk is huge. Solid steel-cage body makes us feel safe in case we get into a fender-bender, and best of all, the insurance rates are low low low. (We pay less for the Lumina than for our Prizm which is 5 years older). Comfy for long trips and around town. My only complaints are the front seats are way too soft, with no lumbar support (you feel like you're gonna slide out the door when you turn), and the exterior mirrors are too small. But if you want SUV-like room and features without the SUV price (OK, and you won't be sitting up high either), you could do worse than a Lumina.<br><br>
