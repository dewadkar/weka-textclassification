            Jaguar XK Series
                    If your going to spend this much on a Jag Coupe or Convertible go for the XKR. It has
                    an awesome 370 horse power Super Charged V8 engine that's a real screamer. And
                    the performance is great too, 0-60 in 5.0 seconds for the coupe and convertible. And
                    the interior is all british with it's burl waltnut dash and conolly leather seats. And get the
                    Navigation system because it looks like a James Bond Car with the LCD in the center
                    of the Burl Walnut Dashboard (It's sweet!) The only set back is the price!! IT IS WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY TOO HIGH!!!!!<br><br>
