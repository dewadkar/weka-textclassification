            I have been driving the Oldsmobile Alero GLS Coupe for almost a year now.  In that time I have had no troubles at all.  Other than routine oil changes the car has not even seen the mechanic.  On that note the oil light on this car, which monitors your driving style and determines when the oil should be changed is fantastic.  I took my car in for its last oil change after having driven it 5200 miles until the light came on.  The mechanic said that the oil was not beginning to breakdown yet so I figure it is fairly accurate.

I first bought the car because I liked the engine performance and the nice sleek look of the car without getting a car that every other person on the road has.  I figured that I could get by with the stated highway 20 MPG.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the 25 MPG I have been getting.  The car has garnered plenty of second looks.  As for the engine performance, I live in Southern California and do a lot of mountain driving, the engine performance is very smooth and unless the incline is extremely steep, you can feel very little difference in the performance.

I do have to admit that as much as I love the car there are a couple of minor items I do dislike.  The front spoiler scrapes everything as you go over it.  I size and placement of the cupholders leaves a lot to be desired.  My biggest complaint is with the trunk release.  You can pop the trunk anytime the car is in park, whether or not the key is in the ignition and I have yet to find a way to disable this 'feature'.  

All in all, this is a car that is in the top of its class as far as comfort, style, and engine performance.  Anyone who is looking for a comfortable car with plenty of room and great looks should check this car out.  The thing I liked the most about it is that it has room for my feet.  I wear a size 15 shoe and even I can get my feet in there and drive comfortably, not an easy task in most other cars in this class.  I would have to say that overall, the Alero GLS Coupe deserves an A+ for its first year.

An update on the year with the Alero.  Still couldn't be happier with the car!  Not only has the car still not been in for any work other than the usual oil change, nor had any problems at all, the value has held up.  I like to keep track of the little things like this.  The car's value has remained high enough to stay above my outstanding loan balance.  For those of you looking for a new car and thinking about the Alero, go for it!  Not only is it the best car I have ever owned, the new models are available in a wider choice of colors.  I have also learned other interesting news about this car.  Not only is it a quality performer, but GM felt so strongly about it, that they put off the Saturn LS to bring the Alero out a year earlier.  Take that for what you want but it tells me GM believes in the car they have produced!<br><br>
