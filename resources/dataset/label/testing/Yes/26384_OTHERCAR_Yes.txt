            The Olds Silhouette is basically the best all-around minivan on the market.  A lot of respected critics like the Honda Odyessey, but in my opinion, its 2nd to the Montana/Silhouette brothers.

The Honda Odyessey is indeed a nice vehicle, but it lacks many features compared the the Silhouette and is in the same price bracket.

The ups about the Odyessey is the extra power, bigger rims,the second power door, and the ride.
I personally do not like the power door for only one reason. Sometimes when you want to throw in a light bag (whatever it would be) in the middle, its easier to just open the door a little bit, throw it in.. and close it instead of waiting for the door to open slowly.  I think having only one power door is a perfect mix for ease of loading, and the convience of the passengers

and now for the downs:

Honda dealers boast about the fold-down rear seat and demonstrate how easy it is to fold down.  The customers always forget that they are shown a empty new-van, everybody keeps their emergency essentials in their trunk like oil, washer fluid, anti-freeze..etc, and tools.  My point is, if you want the extra room with the seat in the floor, you must clean out your trunk before you fold it in, then put it back on top.. and do the opposite when you want the seat back up.  In my opinion, its more trouble then its worth.  The Silhouette has flip and fold seats which can be done in seconds with a pull of a latch.  The rear seat is much more simple then the fancy fold in the floor feature, but better.  Unfortunetely, the 2001 model will have a fold down seat.

The Odyessey's rear air conditioning is also awkward.  It has 2 vents and they blow downwards, the silhouette has numerous vents for each row, and they blow over and above the head, not down into on lap of the passenger.

Honda does not have the load-levelling feature to keep the van level when carrying heavy loads and the compressor in the rear, another great feature the Oldsmobile has.

Lastly, the steering wheel stereo controls and rear controls are not available on the Honda. Also, I am not sure about the overhead console with the trip odometer, gas milage, compass, and temperature being on the Honda.

When you add this up, a loaded Honda does not have many of the neat gadgets in the Silhouette, so you must compare a similarily equipped Silhouette or Montana (most of these gadgets are std in the Olds and opts in the Pontiac).  If you remove the stereo controls (steering + rear), load-leveling (a huge option), leather, and passenger side power seat, fog lights, and heated seats; you are going to find that the Montana or Silhouette is a far better deal for the 1&quot; rim decrease, 25 HP decrease, and so-called &quot;Honda quality.&quot;

The Silhouette has a very quiet ride, and is very comfortable for the passengers.  It is priced slightly higher then the others because of the added insulation and quieter ride (modified suspension) then the Montana and Venture.  The price difference is all up to the customer.  The differences are indeed noticeable, I almost bought a Montana for $1,500CDN less then the Silhouette, but the quieter ride, painted mud-flap moldings behind each wheel, and the classier look bought me over.  I don't regret my choice and I would recommend this van to everybody.<br><br>
