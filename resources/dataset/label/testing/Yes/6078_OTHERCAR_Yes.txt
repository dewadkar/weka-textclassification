            I purchased this vehicle this summer because it looked sharp and I liked the fact that it was a V-6 with plenty of power and a solid appearance.  My other car was a 1989 Mercury Topaz with steering problems.  During the test drive of the Skylark, I found that it was both smooth and stylish.  I liked the automatic lock control when you put it into drive and that it has an air bag in the driver's side.  It feels like a very safe car.  I like the interior and it is comfortable to drive.  It has been very dependable for my wife and me.

I didn't like the gear shift position as it was too close to the wiper control and I have bumped it accidently too many times.  The first problem I have had with the car is the fan, vent control or blower for both the air conditioner and heater.  (I still have not figured out which one it is.)  We converted the AC to 132, but the fan or blower would not send enough cold air.  Now that it is winter, the heater does not seem to work properly.  We get some hot air from the vents and sometimes from the Defrost Vents, but it is not consistent.  On top of that, when I put the setting for the heater to get warmth to my feet, there appears to be no flow.  Recently, the blower/fan has not even turned on at times.  

I was looking for others with the same problem when I found this site.  The car is great overall and I would recommend it to anyone.  It's just that in Chicago, the heat and AC is necessary.  So make sure it works properly when you get it.<br><br>
