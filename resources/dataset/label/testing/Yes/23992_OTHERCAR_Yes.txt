            I bought my Honda Accord sedan, 1992 four-door EX, back in spring 1992 because I had such good luck with my 1983 Honda Accord.  Honda does not disappoint. Even though I would love to trade this in for a second family mini van (an Odyssey, of  course) I know in my heart my Accord has many good years left in it. 

<b>Why We Like the Accord</b>

Comfort and Room - My husband is about 6�2�� and he has no problem fitting into this car. He is comfortable in the driver�s seat, the passenger�s seat and, for short trips, even in the back seat. The seat backs adjust to many different angles and even go back enough to catch a nap.  (WARNING: Do not drive with the passenger�s seat all the way back.  The seat belt will not hold you in from this position.) In addition, the back seat has held my 10-speed bike and I didn�t even have to take the front wheel off.

Trunk size � I am amazed at the amount of trunk space in this car.  I am also amazed at the number of times I have filled that space with televisions, plants, luggage (3 big pieces and a duffle), groceries, even a lawnmower. The back seat folds forward so that large items can fit more easily into the trunk by extending into the passenger compartment.

Ride � Even with over 90,000 miles, the Accord�s ride is still smooth and not terribly noisy. We have taken this vehicle on many long trips and been quite comfortable.  We usually drive 500 miles a day when we have to cover a large distance. Not a problem in this car.  Although, adults in the back seat may be cramped for long rides.

Little Things � This can be the �make it or break it� stuff on a vehicle. The designers paid a lot of attention to details with this car.  First there is a lever on the floor on the driver�s side to open the trunk and another to open the gas cap. Some cars I�ve driven have the levers between the door and the seat making it hard to reach.  Not Honda.  The levers are forward from the seat and very easy to get too. Second, there are seat back pockets like you would find on an airplane on both seat backs.  I use these to keep my fast food coupons handy. Third, both front doors have hard plastic-molded pockets. We keep maps, napkins, and bank envelopes there. Fourth, there are a few items that were standard on a 1992 EX that I just love such as the moon roof/sun roof, the right side mirror, automatic locks, and electric windows. I felt like I truly had purchased a luxury car when I bought this one.

<b>Improvements that could be made to the 1992 model</b>

First of all, please note that some of the improvements I suggest for this car, can be found on Accords manufactured in later model years. They are all minor compared to the amenities found on the Accord.

The drink holder is virtually useless.  You cannot put a mug of coffee in it and you cannot put a soda can in a "koozie" in it.  Also, if you buy the large drink at a fast food place (most economical) the top of the cup hits the radio buttons and keeps changing the station or the tape.  The cup holder should come out another inch and have a cutout for a mug handle. Also, it should be able to take various size drinks from coffee cups to water bottles. 

The armrest for the driver is great, until the passenger insists on using it.  The passenger needs an armrest f his/her own.  Perhaps the armrests could also double as a little bit of storage if they could be made to open.

The AM-FM tape player has a cubbyhole under it. You can't put tapes (or anything else) there because they slide out. There should be a lip on the space or possible a small drawer so that the space can be used.

The rearview mirror has a night/day adjustment.  Has no one ever thought to have night/day adjustments on side mirrors?  I always have some idiot behind me with his high beams on and I can't get away from him.  I'll stop using my side view mirror if the glare is too much and that's dangerous. (This problem is not unique to the Accord but is common to all cars that I have ever driven.)

I like the way the back seat folds down to give me more room in the trunk.  But they could have split the back seat so I can fold down only half.  Also there must be a way to design that so the space from the trunk into the back seat is wider.  My model loses a good foot of width because of the way the car sides come in when the seat is down. Too little of the width of the back seat folds down leaving a smaller opening than is ideal.

The poor little car has been hit twice in parking lots and has had a complete new front end and a complete new passengers side.  But that�s not the car�s fault. It did take about a week to get all the parts in stock to make the repairs (At least both of the other insurance companies let me have a rental). So I guess another disadvantage to this car is that it parts may not be in stock and they are expensive.  Try not to get into any accidents that are your fault. Let someone else�s insurance pay for the repairs.

Overall, I love my 1992 Honda Accord even more than I loved my 1983 version. I will most likely replace this car with another Accord but not for many years.  I have done nothing more than regular maintenance on this vehicle and the most expensive thing was replacing the timely belt recently. I expect that it can easily go to 150,000 miles and I have heard of many Hondas that go much longer. (I got rid of the 1983 Accord at 130,000 miles because it needed a new clutch and I wanted a new car.)
