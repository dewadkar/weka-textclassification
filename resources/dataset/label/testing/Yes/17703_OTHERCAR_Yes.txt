            I have had enough problems with vehicles, that one more may push me over the edge.  I have been taken one too many times by overbearing salespeople, and I�m a rough-and-tough military man.  
	After a hard year of researching different compact and subcompact cars, I chose a Saturn SL with the power package.  
	I feel safe knowing that my wife and daughter are in this car.  I actually toured local junkyards with wrecked Saturns in them to see how well they held up.  I must say, wonderfully.  
	Nothing fancy about my car.  It is a 2000 model with 5,000 miles to date.  True it hasn�t seen a long life so far, but as they say, �so far, so good�.  
	I am a truck man, and a Jeeper as well.  I hate small cars because I feel small, low to the ground, and out of control.  I need to feel like I�m above the traffic, not in it.
	The Saturn is very sports car like in traffic, as the five-speed allows me to keep up with about anything worth it.  I�m glad I chose the manual because the automatic seemed to �hunt� at 45 MPH.  It would have been fun with the SL2 engine, but I believe insurance was higher, not to mention at least $1,000 difference in price.  Above 3,000 RPM there is plenty of power to be had�and there�s a rev limiter that kicks in at the 5,500 RPM redline�a nice safety feature for people like me.
	One point that Saturn owners or previous years warned me about was the paint being easily scratched.  Yes, I have, er, my wife has already scratched the car, but it won�t rust.  It�s plastic!  I think that scratch would have been the same regardless of paint used.  The point is it�s difficult to have a �hard� finish on a flexible part.  I believe they have done a nice job of fixing this problem.  The first Saturns used to scuff quite readily, or so a few owners have told me.  Like I said, I do my homework now.
	I�ve got a real problem with the car�s stability at highway speed.  It gets really unstable, and needs attention.  I assume that different tires and shocks would correct this.  
	Our fuel economy is about what the sticker said it would be, and we find about 40mpg on the highway.  
	Overall, I think we made the right choice to purchase a Saturn, and will do so again in about 12 years when the current one gets handed down to our daughter.
