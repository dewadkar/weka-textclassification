            1994 Dodge Caravan	

Purchased New in April 1994. It was great for about 1 year. Then we started having some problems with in. Most was covered under warranty but still. A van that new should not be having problems so soon.

We had 2 rear window wiper motors within one year. We also ended up having the transmission rebuilt,
the left front axle replaced and engine work.

I traded this van this week on a new caravan, at the same dealership. I wouldn't have, but the repairs were starting up again.  I had 87,000 miles on it. The worst thing wrong with it was the paint. All the 94's were and are bad about the paint chipping off.

When the van was well :-) It was a nice van. Served its purpose well. I did alot of travel back and forth to my parents with 2 small children. 

We use this van to help us move(We took the seats out and put in  a washer in) We also moved my in-laws twice. Once in NC and once from NC to SC. 

If you can find one in decent shape, this van would be okay for a used van. But like any used van, you may end up with alot of repairs. Just depends. I like to think mine was a decent van. With fairy good results. This van doesnï¿½t have a very high Kelly blue book value. So the price would need to be very very good.
