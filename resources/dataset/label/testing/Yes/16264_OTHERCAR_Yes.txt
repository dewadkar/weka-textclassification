            I bought this car to replace my '84 Honda Civic.  I was looking to buy another Honda when I went to a Toyota dealership nearby.  I thought I'd give them a try and asked for a four-door, stick shift.  After looking for quite some time in their back-lot, I came across a 1999 Toyota Corolla... stick.  After test driving it and getting a price of 12K (air, alarm, etc.)... I bought it.

It looks like your ordinary &quot;regular&quot; car, but it's pretty zippy.  And the stick handling is very, very smooth.  The interior is spacious and is good enough for me... I'm 6'10&quot; and 200++lbs.  Most of the controls and mechanisms are easily reached while driving... except that you cannot have a beverage in the holder and use the ashtray at the same time... oh well.

I didn't have much choice on the color... I'm not fond of white... to easily messed up.  Other than that I', very pleased with it.

Unless you're going to paint flames running down the sides, it's not going to turn heads... so if you're into cruising up and down the street... don't buy this car.  But if you like maneuverability and affordability, buy the standard and have fun.
