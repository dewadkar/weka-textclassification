            This is a car that I absolutely loved, it was fast enough for a luxury car, it was smooth, quiet, comfortable.  I would drive this car in a rain storm and had the confidence to drive at normal highway speeds unlike other cars that were slowing down around me.  This audi is a front wheel drive model, not even the quattro, and boy it was one of the best handling cars I have ever driven during the winter.  The steering wheel can be turned with one finger, the red glow of the dash is soothing.  The on board computer system is excellent and clear.  The seats can easily handle long trips.  ONE major word of warning though...  If you are planning to buy a car like this you should bring it to a mechanic that knows audis, other mechanics might miss some problems unique to audis and it might end up costing you.  Also be sure that the car you are buying has been taken care of.  Find a local mechanic that you can trust, do not go to big dealers because you will pay for it.  I had some problems with the car, (leaking oil, hydraulic fluid, and the AC did not work)  3 out of 4 dealers were going to charge me $4000 to fix these problems, one was truthful and charged me $1800 and fixed the car perfect.  This car is very reliable, but it needs to be taken care of, and it needs a good mechanic that will not rip you off.
