            A 1994 Grand Am GT with the 3.1L V6 was (is) my first car.  I am 19, and I bought the car at 16.  It was bought for $10,500, and has all the options these cars came with (ie, power locks, windows).  When I first got it, it had around 56,000 miles on it.  Now, almost four years later, it has 162,000 miles on it, and hasn't once left me stranded.  To be fair, it has had it's problems.  The brakes are a constant pain.  Once it even ate the calipers.  When the mechanic took the left/rear wheel off, the caliper (in it's many pieces) clanked to the ground.  But the car had stopped consistently, even with a problem like this.  I have been fortunate not to have the alternator problems that seem to plague GM V-engine cars.  This car is on its second one.  I just got the car back from the shop today because its radiator tank developed a hole, but even then it held enough water to get it to the shop.  

I'm also one for preventative maintainance.  I took it to the dealer and let them do the 100k service...the only service the dealer has ever done on that car.  It included a block flush, a power steering flush, fuel injection cleaning, and all sorts of other more minor things.  The total was about $1k, but I think it was worth it.  It doesn't knock or ping or smell funny.  It burns a tiny bit of oil if it sits too long without driving.  

The bumpers are amazing.  This car has ruined 3 pick ups that rammed it from behind.  All of them took damage.  The bumper still looks like new.  
One of those trucks knocked the car over a curb, and it clipped a building.  The front bumper had to be replaced, but nothing else.  The Dodge Ram barely drove off.  Amazing.

But the main thing I love about this car is the power.  I put a K&amp;N air filter in it, and had the exhaust redone, and WOW!  This car turned into a Mustang eater.  It has gotten to the point to where I won't even race the regular Mustangs because they're too easy.  The GT's can keep up, but only for a while.  Mustang GTs supposedly have well over 200hp, while my little Grand Am only has 160hp.  With some sensa-tracks and low profile tires on it, it thinks it's a muscle car.  Plus the rumble from the glass packs is neat. :)

It rides a bit rough, but something about the seats makes any trip liveable.  They don't make your posterior sore like a lot of cars do.<br><br>
