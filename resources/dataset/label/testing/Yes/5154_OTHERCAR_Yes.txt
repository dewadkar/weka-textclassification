            Well, let me tell you my story about my good old grand prix, 1st and only car I have ever owned. I have a Grand Prix SE 1991, 4 Door, with a 3.1 LT Engine. It was a hand me down from my dad, who bought it almost new in 1992, I love the car, no doubt about that, I love the feel of driving it and since I am 6'3&quot; I have a lot of leg room which most of my friend's cars don't have and if your in high school with a sharp looking car like a grand prix your a pretty popular guy! I've had the car for a few years now but I have had problems with the braking system! When my dad gave it to me, he told me the brakes were getting warn down and I should replace the pads, When I brought it in, they said I needed a new everything, as far as the brakes go..new calipers, rotors, and pads. 

I also found out fast that grand prix parts arn't as cheaps as I wish they were. I got a deal of around $400 for all the work to front and back brakes. Even though the braking system was new, they still did not function at 100%. I brought it back thinking they did them wrong, but they that the grand prix has a werid stepup for there braking systems with certain cables being connected to certain places and to have it perfect you have to bring it to a dealer who will change you a lot more money. So I was stuck with new brakes that worked alright, but not as good as I wanted them to work. Another problem that my dad had when he drove it was the fuel injectors, for some reason that model has a tendacy to get very dirty inside as far as the fuel injectors go, and if you don't take care of it, the clog and then the car just stalls on you, which happened to me! and I had to get them professional cleaned. Then after that I had a alternator problem were I was stuck on the side of the road for a long time..no power at all..which doesn't help if you have everything digital on your car, it doesn't even attempt to start up. Then I find out its something to do with a diagram that was sucking air out of my engine and stalling it whenever a let up off the brake. Those repairs cost me a excess of $450. So as you can see 

The Grand Prix is not a car that has no problems, but you have to understand one thing there is 134,500 miles on it, which is quiet alot..and served my dad very well..me..I got stuck with all the repairs bills..but I love the ride of the car..and the way the inside setup is is nice..for night riding the dash looks like a lighted space ship controls..and my radio controls are right on the steering wheel which is unquie and I love it. I just hope I don't have anymore repairs that need to be done..wish me luck! But in my opinion if you find this car with low milege on it for a cheaper price then blue book..get it..and I'm sure you'll have lots of miles out of it..just make sure you get some fuel infector cleaner for it!<br><br>
