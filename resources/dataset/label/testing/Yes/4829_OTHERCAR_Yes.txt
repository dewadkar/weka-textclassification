            I was told by my boss lately that it was coming a time to trade in my 1996 Chrysler LHS, and get another company car.  I immediately went to my local Chrysler dealer.  I requested a LHS and a 300M.  When I drove the 2000 LHS, I knew this was the one for me.  The things that impressed me the most was the handling, auto-door opener, heated seats, and the price.

First, the handling.  Right when I drove off the lot, I could tell this car has tight steering, which is good if the car ahead of you put on the brakes, and you had to swerve to miss him, it turns on a dime.  It also had a nice ride, better than the 300M.  In the 300M, you could "feel" the ground as you were driving over it.  In the LHS, it was more of a coast over the highway, instead of feeling every bump along the way.

Next, there's the auto-door opener.  I never thought this was possible.  When you buy the car, you get 2 door openers.  One for husband, one for wife (or whoever).  But, depending on who opens the door with the door opener, it will set it to the radio stations/or, if that person was listening to a CD last time, it will find the one CD out of the four CD disk changer that person likes.  AND it will set the seat.  Raise, lower, forward, back, or tilt.  That blew me away.

Next, there's heated seats.  What an ingenious idea.  My wife is always cold, and I always ride with the windows rolled down.  So, she can set her side of the car to be 80 degrees, while my side can stay 71 degrees.  It does this with the heated seats.  Setting it to two different degrees also changes the air temperature and how hard it blows on either side.

Lastly, there's the price.  For $26,000, you couldn't ask for more.  Besides the handling, auto door opener, and heated seats, it also has a very spacious trunk with a big "mouth" on it for easy access and a great looking car.  I am going back to get it later this week, and I know I like it, and think everyone will.
