            In looking for a newer car, I wanted something that was sophisticated, and sporty... the usual for a college guy. I compared the MX-6 to Acura Integra, Nissans, and New Eclipses. Here is why the MX-6 came out on top. The styling of the car is beautiful. It had a very sleek aerodynamic design that doesn't scream out &quot;I'm some kid&quot;. It has a balance to the design that cannot be matched by the Mitsubishi Eclipses (which in my opinion look like a 40 year old woman's large butt). The LS version of the MX-6 has a V-6 with more than enough power for the road. Getting it with a manual trans, does allow for easy manipulation of the engine. Shifting gears is very smooth, and the clutch is excellent. The version I bought also has every option on it, leather, manual trans, sunroof, power everything. The dials are easy to reach, and nicely lit. For space in the car, it comes with a trunk that the Mafia would fall in love with. You can fit pretty much anything you can imagine in it (For example, an entire computer system and a friends suitecase and food and 4 12 packs of 12oz bottles of beer finished up with a bottle of Capt. Morgan's as a present for a friend). The seats are &quot;liveable&quot;. I have never sat in more comfortable leather seats in my life. The back seats look nice... but it gets cramped for anyone over 5'6&quot;
Why I chose this car versus the others...
Styling, and performance of both the engine, and the handling of the car. For an Integra you will end up paying $7,ooo for an inline 4-cyl. with V-Tec to compare in engine performance of this car. The Nissans are underpowered, and lack the thrust that most cars do. The Eclipse is just unimpressive, and has lots of mechanical problems (It is the cheap man's sports car - you get what you pay for, but it will look good in the mechanic's service garage). The aftermarket value of the car is very good.
Bad things....
The only bad thing about this car is that it is long. But I guess that gives it its presence on the road.<br><br>
