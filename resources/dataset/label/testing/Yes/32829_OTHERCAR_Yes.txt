            Part of this is in response to jkusina's opinion about her friends 1995 Cavalier.
I personally have owned a Chevrolet Cavalier since November 16, 1995.
In that time I have accrued just over 74,000 miles.  The car doesn't look like it just rolled out of the factory, but it is in very good shape.
The only major problems I have had were 2 starter failures, two fuel injector failures, and a model wide PCM recall.
The starters were simply faulty items (this could happen on any car), and the fuel injector failures were my own fault (they don't like it when you run out of gas).
As for regular maintenance, I do my own.  I have used synthetic oil since the break in period ended, every 4K miles.  I should inform jkusina that a serpentine belt replacement for $70 is way over priced.  It only takes 20 minutes for a mechanically inclined individual to install the $16 belt.  I have also replaced the stock 100,000 mile Platinum plugs with Bosch Platinum +4 plugs (a whole other opinion there).
Unlike most people who will submit opinions about these cars, I race my 1995 Cavalier.  I do two types of racing: drag racing and autocrossing.  The car does well in both arenas.
I don't even have the Z24 model, and the only thing I can think of that would make this car better would be a V6.
