            If you want to capture the great moments of the family to share with other family members, <b>Kodak EasyShare LS420 Digital Camera</b> has a very easy-to-use technology, named Kodak Picture Software that can help you meet your goals. All you need to do is to take your pictures.  At the touch of the button on the dock, the pictures will be transferred to your computer so you can improve, trim, show them as slide, cut red eyes and save them.  You can also e-mail them as you wish.  Instead of having to deal with complaints due to overloading of your friends' and family members' e-mail system, I would advise you to upload them to your site and ask them to check them out.  It's a much easier process instead of having to send all this information.  If you don't have DSL or broadband infrastructures, this can be a tedious task.  

Any way, Kodak's EasyShare technology is the most efficient software that I have seen for great manipulation of picture.  Yes, of course there is the free software of Adobe.com.  Active Share is a great software.  I would say it's as easy as the EasyShare of Kodak.  I have used both so far.  I have had great results with my pictures.

<b>Testimonial from two users, friends of mine</b>

For the sake of this review, I will call user 1 Pat.  She needed to buy a camera to take pictures of her son who plays high school basketball.  Her daughter is on the swim team at the local high school too.  Each one of the kids had his/her own camera that was their favorite.  But mother wanted to buy a very functional camera, one that would be not only beautiful but also has a good technolgy.  After browsing at the store and asking many questions with the kids in tow, she settled for the Kodak EasyShare LS420.  She has been using it a lot at the various meets.  Her kids like it too. 

Liz is a social worker.  She usually has to take pictures of her clients on her caseload.  For her annual meeting, she usually updates her archives by taking pictures of her clients which she quickly prints and places in the files.  She is happy with the results she has had so far.  "This is my own initiative."  What she means is that she did not wait for the agency to buy it for her.  She bought for her own use and figured out this camera would be a useful tool in her work.  "Once the camera is on the dock, you only have to press a button on the dock and the pictures get transferred," she added.

<b>Great deal for the camera and dock together</b>

When my wife bought my DX37...Kodak camera, she had to buy the dock separately.  She paid close to $90.00 for the dock.  The combination of this camera and dock for this price confirms that the longer you wait, the lower the price gets.  

<i>Some of the features you expect to find in this camera and as listed</i>

2.1 MP for beautiful prints
Kodak color science technology 
Night shot flash mode 
On-camera print button
Video with audio capabilities 
Part of the EasyShare system

<b>Final words of encouragement</b>

This is a nice, pocket-size camera that you can carry with you.  If you are going on a trip, you can just slip it into your pocket.  You will be right in business.  Take as many pictures as you want and get back home to transfer via the dock.  If you shop around, you can even find a better value.  This camera is reliable and will meet your basic photography needs.
