            I thought since no one has yet written a review for the 2002 Neon, I'd give you a quick overview of my experience thus far.  I bought my car two weeks ago today.  It is a red SXT model, which I believe just came into production this year.  The car's looks are beautiful.  They will satisfy just about anyone, no matter what you look at in a car.  On one hand, the four door coupe could be a cute little eye-catching family car.  On the other hand, in my case, it's a flashy and sporty looking car for a single driver with it's great looking rims and sleek compact body style.  For those who want to go all out, the windows can be tinted, there's plenty of room for a system (six speakers) and there are chrome rim and leather interior options.  However, this is a little outlandish considering the car is relatively low-priced, and meant to satisfy customers shopping in this car's class.  The interior comes in three colors, mine being the slate gray/black.  It looks great in a red car.  The backseat folds down, opening up the trunk to allow more cargo space.  Great for traveling or hauling things to your college dorm or new apartment.  The car includes many options as well, including power locks and windows, however strangely the backseat windows are manual in all models.  The car also comes with keyless entry, trunk unlock button, and a microchipped theft-prevention key.  There is a "sun/sound package" option with which for about 1200 dollars includes a 4 disc changer and a power sunroof.  I am starting to regret the fact that I chose this option, as the CD player has malfunctioned twice already, having a tendency to jam, refusing to release the discs inside the player.  Very irritating.  The other problem I had occurred two days ago.  A manufacturer's defect in the tire caused a flat with only 1200 miles on the vehicle.  Forgive me, but I don't know the size tires offhand.  They are from Goodyear.  Of course, the dealer has been reasonable about helping me out, but you can only drive 20 miles to have cds removed from your player so many times before it's just not worth it anymore.  Anyway, other than that I have all good things to say about the car so far.  The handling is wonderful, being that the car is small and compact.  It makes nice tight turns and handles curves at pretty high speeds.  Another plus is this car's acceleration, once again due to the fact that the car is small and lightweight.  For the size of the engine in the car (2.0L 132 hp) it has a surprising amount of power.  The driver must take into consideration though, that while a smaller car can be advantageous in certain situations, it can be hazardous as well.  Driving a smaller car, you give up the extra protection provided by more area in a larger vehicle.  It's also much easier to lose traction in a lightweight car, so caution must be taken.  This is not only with the Neon, but for any smaller lighter weight car.  So, that's the run-down so far being that the car is only two weeks old...I will return in the future with further updates.
