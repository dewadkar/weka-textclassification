            So my family and I have one room with three computers in it and often will sit in that room, each at our separate computers and not say a word.  We probably spend way too much time on computers, but that does mean that we end up needing a lot of computer products.  We have four computers (working, several more in the attic), four printers, one scanner, one fax, and several other toys most likely.  What we didn't have was a digital camera.  We found that with the way things are going, we were increasingly finding times when it would be very nice to have a digital camera.  The scanner just wasn't cutting it.  So my parents went out to buy the camera.

Now, mind you, my parents have never been very good at spending the few extra bucks necessary to get the good product.  They usually buy a cheap wanna-be product that never gets any use and wasn't worth the money spent.  That's what I expected.  However, that's not what I got.

What they brought home was the Olympus D-460.  It's beautiful!  It has a flash, it zooms pretty close, it has the screen so you know exactly what is going to be in the picture, and all sorts of other features.  I was amazed!  It couldn't be that good could it?  Well, no, my dad said that the battery life wasn't very long, so to fix that he bought an adapter that makes it so you can plug it in to the wall and that is a life saver when you are downloading pictures.  It only holds 35, but that's plenty for us, you may need more, but we certainly don't.  It has the great feature where you can preview all the pictures and delete ones you don't like, and every time you take a picture it freezes the picture there for a minute so you can see it before going on to the next picture.  It apparently has a feature where you can just keep clicking, but I haven't used that yet.  However I have used the nice feature where you press the button down half way and that gets the camera ready, then you press all the way and it immediately takes the picture.  Otherwise, it takes a few seconds if you want to just one-click it.

I was amazed at the picture, I have to tell you.  I'm used to scanners where after you scan the picture in, if you try to enlarge it any all you see are pixels.  You can enlarge these pictures at least twice before you see the pixels and that's DOUBLING the picture TWICE!  Very impressive.

I admit that we had to pull out the manual a few times because it has so many features and the menu option is a bit confusing.  They use symbols a lot instead of actual words.  For instance there's a picture of a trash can for delete, but the picture then goes to two more pictures, one of another trash can and one of a hammer.  What's that???  I'm not sure, but the manual probably says.

So when you get this camera, get the adapter to plug it into the wall and you'll be fine on battery life, and for goodness sake, read the manual!  :)  Hope I've helped.
