            I previously had a Nikon Coolpix 850, and while it was a very good camera, I just found it too damn big to carry around.  The Canon is about half the size of the Nikon, and fits quite comfortably in my shirt pocket.  

The size really came in handy during our recent ski trip, when it was easy to carry on the slopes.  I tried the photostitching feature ad nauseam, and actually found it to be incredibly simple.  I have a couple of 360 pictures from the top of Heavenly at Lake Tahoe that are just great.  The screen is also amazing, and the menus become pretty easy to navigate once you play with them of a while.  The zoom feature is not great, since the digital 4x zoom comes out pretty fuzzy, but a really nice feature is that the lens automatically retracts and covers itself when you turn the camera off.

The only complaint I have is that Canon forces you to use their rechargeable battery pack, so if you run out of juice you're fried.  I just purchased a spare battery pack, but I know I missed some great shots due to the limited life of one batter - figure on about 30-40 pictures with the screen on.
