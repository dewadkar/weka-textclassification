            This car is one of the best in it's class in my opinion PERFORMANCE WISE.  According to Motor Trend, the 0-60 is 7.4 sec., and other magazines give the range of about 7.4-8.4.  That is kind of a difference there, but pretty good for a $13,000 car!  I had compared this car to the Honda Civic HX (the car which it is most comparable to).  This car is much faster, but the HX was quieter and sturdier around corners.  The audio system in the ZX2 is excellent compared to the civic.  The main reason I choose the ZX2 over the civic was because the ZX2 was $1000 cheaper, included a spoiler, better stereo system, included A/C and had a ZETEC (comparable to VTEC in Honda only available in EX) engine.  The $13,000 ZX2 doesn't include a rear defogger, which can be annoying at times, but bearable.  Although with the extra options in the ZX2, the resale isn't comparable to the Civic.  Remember, the ZX2 is a Ford, which means reliability doesn't compare to a Honda.  If you are more investment minded, then the civic is right for you.  If you want a car for a few years of driving fast, and then planning to switch cars later on, then you should look into the ZX2.  One more thing to remember is that the ZX2 isn't all American either.  The transmission and engine are made from Mazda, which might make it more reliable than any other Ford, but the name Ford itself I hate to say doesn't keep the value as a Honda.
