               I own a 1996 Mercedes C220 and I love it!! I previously owned a 1989 190e
2.6 for 3 years and it was an excellent and reliable car that offered a safe ride and stylish luxury after aging 11 years.  The C220, although, has a small 2.2 4-cylinder does have &quot;some&quot; pep while driving.  From a stand still its slow to accelerate quickly.  The weight of this car is approx. 3300 lbs and you feel every bit of it.  The ride is like no other...smooth...smooth...smooth. Handling is excellent. When I sold my 1989 190e,(and I had no problem selling it) I drove other cars such as 1998 Accords, Acura CL, BMW 3 series, Audi A4, even bought a 1995 Maxima. No comparison to the drive. Once you have driven 
a Mercedes its hard to change models. I sold the Maxima a week after owning it, and bought the 1996 C220.  If you need the power, the C280 6-cylinder or the C230 Komp offers more torque.  I guess you can say I baby my cars and very rarely need or want to step-on-it and the savings on price for the C220 was better than the C280. I am hoping the reliability is just as good as the 190e.  This car is just out of warranty at 50K miles, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping to keep this car for years to come.<br><br>
