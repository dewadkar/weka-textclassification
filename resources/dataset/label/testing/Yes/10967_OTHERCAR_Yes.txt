            This vehicle is very dependable. Handles the road good. Easy to work on. If you can't fix it yourself the parts are reasonable. I bought one in 1994 and put 132,000 miles on it and it still ran like a dream when i traded it in . The trade value i thought was reasonably decent. I just bought another one and it still runs good like the first one i had. Hope to hold on to this one as long as the last one<br><br>
