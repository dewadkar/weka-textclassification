            Recently I drove the newest entry by Toyota in the small car market.  I was definitely skeptical of the size of this vehicle.  But, I took the plunge anyway.  I drove the four door version.  Being  6'2&quot; tall, I was interested in interior comfort.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Leg and head room were more than adequate.  

There are so many nooks and crannies for storage in this vehicle.  The salesman explained it properly by saying it was designed from the inside out.  The trunk also appears very adequate.

Get up and go with this vehicle is great.  The highway ride was also  pretty nice.

I was comparison shopping the Toyota Echo with the Honda Civic.  I believe there is more room in the back seat of the Echo than the Civic.  Previously I have recommended the Civic.  I now will include the Echo with my recommendations.
