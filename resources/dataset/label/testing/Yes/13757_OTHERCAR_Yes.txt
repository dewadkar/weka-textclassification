            I am very pleased with this vehicle.  I was a previous Dodge Caravan owner and wanted to stay with Dodge.

I special ordered to get the color of interior and exterior I wanted.  Light Almond exterior (great for not showing dirt) and taupe interior.  I thought it would be more expensive to custom order, when infact it was cheaper than choosing from the lot.

I got a great financing deal through Chrylser.  0.8% over 60 months. 

6 cylinder, 3.3 L engine, 4 wheel ABS, Dual Airbags, Front and Rear heat/air, 16" rims, Roomy interior, CD player, Upgraded Stereo system with DVD player, Power doors and hatch, Keyless entry with 2 remotes, No leather or towing package (that was an upgraded package) Roof rack, Removable Center console.  The center console has power and has the capability of hooking up your game system to it.  (For those with children the DVD player and power for game system is a life saver on long trips).  Overhead trip/temperature console.

The only drawback on the room is that because of the middle captains chairs and dual side doors,  it makes it a little more difficult getting into the back bench seat.  Seats lift forward and you must crawl over them to some degree.  With the bench seat, as in the older models, getting into the back was much easier.  I asked if it was possible to get the bench instead of the chairs.  It was only possible if I wanted to get built in child seats in the bench or downgrade the model.

I also found that the cruise control buttons are NOT illuminated.  So any driving at night requires your memory to find the correct buttons for cruise.  Very irritating 

Also found the screen for DVD player rattles slightly when in the down position.

I had the option (relatively inexpensive) to get the back bench that splits for easier removal.  I didn't take it because I don't change configuration frequently enough and if I have three children in the back bench, it's a fight who sits in the middle on the split.  Went for the bench.

Came with 7 year power train warrantee.  EXCELLENT!!

I did not take the protection package for $1500.00.  This included undercoating, paint and fabric protection.  I took my van to an outside company and paid $400.00 for the same package and warrantee.
