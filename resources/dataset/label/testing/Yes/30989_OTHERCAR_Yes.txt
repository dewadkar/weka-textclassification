            I've wanted one these Trans Ams for years and often dreamt about cruising the Texas Hill Country.  Last November my dream came true.  These cars are truly amazing.  The 320 horse power LS1 V8 resets the standard that small block V8s are measured against.  First time I test drove the car, the salesman continued to encourage me to get on it and see what kind of power this car delivers, well . . . I didn't have my seatbelt on and I nailed it.  The car took off so quick and with such force that I slid out of my seat and hit my head on the T-Tops.

While there are some deficancies, they are easy to correct.  Specifically every owner should replace the lower control arms and install a shock tower brace. That should keep the rear wheels behind the car.<br><br>
