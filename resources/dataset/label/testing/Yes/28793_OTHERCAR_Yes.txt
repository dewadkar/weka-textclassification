            We've had this car for 2 years and so far it's been fairly impressive, especially considering the low cost of ownership. We have the LS model with almost every option available.

The biggest thing that made the Lumina appealing was its relatively low purchase price. You'd be hard pressed to find another mid-size sedan comparably equipped for the same price as the Lumina.

The engine accelerates eagerly but is rather noisy at higher RPMs. Gas mileage could be considered a little above average for this type of car.

But any sport appeal the engine generates is lost thanks to the lackluster braking and floaty suspension. The brakes are obivously a rung down the ladder compared to its competitors. And the suspension is too soft for any serious enthusiast driving. But then again, most people who buy this car want a comfortable ride, not handling superiority. And comfortable it is.

The exterior styling, although not ground-breaking, is distinctive and attractive. It would be hard to mistake a Lumina for another car on the road. The proportions all seem just right and there isn't one offensive line or angle on the body.

The interior styling is on par with most of its competitors, except maybe for the material used on the doors. The interior room provided isn't as much as you'd expect. I actually feel like I have more room in the front seat of a Corolla then this Lumina. But the seats are rather comfortable and long trips are easy to survive.

As for the climate control and sound system, nothing really special there. They are the norm for mid-size sedans. They do their job adequately but they are not overachievers.

If somebody is looking for a decent mode of transportation for a decent price, you really can't get much better then a Lumina. What it may lack in some areas it more then makes up for it thanks to its low ownership cost. Although, this won't be a car that any owner will have a love affair with.
