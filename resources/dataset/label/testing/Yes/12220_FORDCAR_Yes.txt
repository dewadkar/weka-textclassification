            You opinion of the 1994 thunderbird seems to really be a review of the dealership that you purchased the car from. The T-bird themselves are not all plagued with the particular problems you noted. My husband is a Ford mechanic and we purchased a 1994 t-bird due to it being very reliable and for the most part problem free compared to other ford products in the same class and price range.
I recommend you direct your opinion toward the dealership not the car itself. I do however agree with your recommendation to friends and that it really is a great family car and is very stylish as well as comfortable.<br><br>
