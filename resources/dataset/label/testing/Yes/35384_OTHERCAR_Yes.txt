            When I was a teenager there were very few things that didn't excite me.  On the other hand, being excited was so common that few things really seemed special, either.  The one exception was the Mercedes Benz SL class (except the SLC, which I never understood).  No one symbol of 70's consumerism said you had arrived more succinctly than a 450 SL with the top down.

It isn't that the current SL's are any less a luxury ride and certainly not that they cost any less.  I think it is that we have lost our ability to be collectively impressed.  We all knew that the Eagles meant a 450 SL when they sang &quot;she got a Mercedes Benz&quot;.   If Richard Gere had tried to drive any other car up PCH to the accompaniment of Blondie, we would not have accepted it.  Face it, the SL was, for one brief shining the epitome of success and we all knew it.

I bought my first SL as a thirtieth birthday present for myself.  It was a '76 450 SL, Gold with Brown canvas and only 65,000 &quot;lady driven&quot; miles.  Even though she was 15 years out of the showroom, there was not a single thing wrong with her.  

One of the great mysteries of the automotive world is why they call these cars SL.  It stands for Super Light, but anyone who has ever opened the door knows light never entered into the design process.  I truly believe that this class of Mercedes is heavier, on a size v. weight scale, than any other. 

You would think that I would have been to old to be impressed with a status symbol that had seen its day pass by.  You would be wrong.  I was giddy the whole first month.  I played &quot;Call Me&quot; on the tape deck and may have even unbuttoned one too many shirt buttons as I drove down the highway.

That 450 gave me pleasure for several years before I passed her along to another whose dreams needed tending.  I went on to buy a Grey Market 300 SL with the 300E engine.  It was a better car, but it was never the same.
