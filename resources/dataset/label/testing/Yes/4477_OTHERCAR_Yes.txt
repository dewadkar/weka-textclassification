            Before I post this opinion I need to state a disclaimer.  My wife and I presently own 5 Mercedes Benz vehicles.

We purchased this vehicle because we wanted an SUV.  Mercedes was the only one considered.  We absolutely fell in love with it the first time we drove it.  We ended up purchasing a used ML-320 with 37K miles.  It was a dream driving home from the dealer.  I tested it on curves and back roads.  It performs marvalously.

After our elation of ownership the reality soaked in.  It didn't have the quietness and smooth ride we were expecting from the Mercedes.  The wind noise was almost unbearable compared to our 1988 E-Class.  The ride was &quot;active.&quot;

We subscribed to an M-Class newsgroup and found that our problems were similar to all other's complaints.  The fuel gauge was inaccurate, the sunroof allowed wind noise, the doors allowed wind noise, a side moulding fell off during a funeral procession.  All of the problems documented in the newsgroup.  One of the most disheartening for me is the air conditioner.  It will not freeze you out like most M-B.  Some suggest because of the volume to cool.  Whatever, it just makes it comfortable.

The scheduled oil changes are 15000 and if one drives conservatively, the computer will even compute more miles.  This is a big advantage since we live 3.5 hours from our dealer.

We are scheduled for a service in the near future so I asked my wife what was on her list to be fixed.  Believe it or not, we don't have a complaint or problem this service time.  In other words the bugs are worked out.  It may be a Mercedes after all.  However, it is noisy compared to other Mercedes.  I sluff it off with, &quot;After all it is a truck.&quot;<br><br>
