            <b>1st A LITTLE ON WHY I ONLY REVIEW AUTOMOBILES SUSPENSION SYSTEMS:</b>


<b><i>I have been a State of Michigan certified steering and suspension technician for almost 15 years, and certified in other areas for over 22 years.</b></i>  I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, engine, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed automobile purchasing decision. After reading my reviews, read some on other aspects of the car you're looking for from the advisors here at epinions, and make your choice.

<b>NOW THE STRATUS:</b>

<b><i>This review will cover every year of Stratus made, since the suspension and steering system has gone mostly unchanged since its inception.</b></i>

In the long line of auto suspension reviews I have written, there is an underlying theme you will find. If the auto I am reviewing has the <i>&quot;double wishbone suspension&quot;</i>, or a copy of <i>Hondas &quot;double wishbone&quot;</i>, I rave about it. Get set to hear a rave people because the good folks at <b>Dodge</b> have done themselves proud.

When the <i>&quot;double wishbone suspension&quot;</i> (henceforth to be referred to in the interest of minimizing typing, as the: DWS)  came out on the Honda Accord it was at that time almost avant guard, it was to be sure a revolution in suspension design. Since then many have tried to copy this award winning construction and have met with instant success.

The Dodge Stratus is one of those copy cats where you don't mind being the recipient of the benefits. To start off with, the design of this suspension is such that it in itself makes the automobile it is under a well handling machine. The Dodge Stratus is one such well handling motorcar. From the first road test you will be sold on the level cornering and instant steering response the <b>DWS</b> provides.

<b>THE BITS AND PIECES:</b>

Under the Stratus you will find a fully four wheel independent suspension featuring , again in front the famous <b>DWS.</b> Steering is via the rack and pinion method as is almost every front wheel drive vehicle today. Though the car steers very lightly, much like the Accord it emulates, and the inner tie rods operate in an almost horizontal plane keeping wear on those parts to a bare minimum, the Stratus has had a problem with wearing the outer tie rods sooner than they should. The outer tie rods are not greasable, so there is nothing you can do to them in a preventive maintenance manor. Honda does it better where this is concerned.

The front ball joints, going against modern convention are in fact greasable. This is almost unheard of these days where hardly any auto manufacturers allow for the ball joints or tie rods to accept chassis grease. In like manner, the rear ball joints are greasable, and this to me is without a doubt a step in the right direction. A person should be able to make His/ Her car last with the price they charge these days, and we all owe Daimler-Chrysler appause for letting us do so with the addition of grease fittings. Now all that remains is to make sure whom ever does your vehicle maintenance actually greases the parts.

Linking everything together is an anti-roll bar package that is on par with everything else in its class, and with the anti-roll personality of the <b>DWS</b> already, you have a very stable package while cornering.

Gas charged strut/shock combinations will keep the tires firmly planted on the road and a decent set of coil springs round out the steering suspension package. The spring steel these are made out of is of good quality too, so sag won't be a problem until mileage gets into the six figure area.

<b>ALIGNMENT ADJUSTABILITY:</b>

As with every other <b>DWS</b> or <b>DWS</b> copy, the only thing you can adjust on the front suspension is the toe in/ toe out angle. This means you as the driver of this cloud <i>better be careful around curbs and potholes and such</i>, because should you knock the caster or camber far enough out to require alignment to bring the previously excellent handling car back to that state, you won't be able to. Now you will have to visit a body shop with frame straightening machines, or invest in expensive kits to correct this faux pas.

Meanwhile back behind you, Dodge had done the Honda Motor Company one better. Instead of just allowing you to adjust rear toe in/ toe out, you are given a beefy and well engineered set of threaded rods that allow you to actually adjust rear camber in concert with the toe adjustment. Thread one in or out for toe, or thread both out equidistant for camber.

The first time I saw this underneath a Stratus, I almost cried. Maybe because it was one of those times when I asked myself why I didn't invent it first, or maybe because the snotty nosed boys straight out of engineering school actually did something that made sense, and it works so well to boot.

<b>ALL WRAPPED UP IN A NICE SHELL:</b>

So there you have it. An American made <i>(well mostly)</i> automobile you don't have to wear a bag over your head to drive. An intelligently designed and executed suspension system that should give you mile upon mile of driving pleasure without those annoying regular stops to rebuild the suspension.

I now invite you to do some research on the other aspects of the car from the advisors here at epinions as well as other satisfied members and this should leave you with only one question..... What color ?
