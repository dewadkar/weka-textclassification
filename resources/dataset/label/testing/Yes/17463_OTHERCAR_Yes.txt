            Finally I have been able to shed myself of my lemon of a Windstar. (see review) The paint was peeling for the third time and I told my husband that I was done. I did not want to drive that thing any further. Of course he had other opinions but said we could go look anyway. 

I had seen a commercial for the KIA Sedona about a week or so earlier. Advertising for around $19,000. That was approximately what we had paid for our Windstar three years ago. I was curious to see what features it had and what it looked like. So after DH got back from one of his week long trips we hoofed it on over to the local KIA dealership. The dealership it's self was new to our area only being there for almost a year. I had been aware of KIA's before. I learned about them back in the 80's and they were kind of a joke car There is even a reference to them in an early Friend's episode. But we were about to learn more.

Our salesperson was Jim Swiekosky. Forgive me if I have spelled the last name wrong. He was very friendly and helpful. Our kids pretty much caused havoc to the entire dealership and no one, especially Jim, batted an eye. Basically Jim let us look over the vehicle and then take one for a test-drive. The one we test drove was a higher end model. By no means expensive though. It's price was at around $23,000 and loaded. It had leather seats, wood trim through out the interior, lots of chrome trim, and many other items.

One of the first things that impressed us was the engine. Our Windstar had a 3.0L V6. The Sedona comes with a 3.5L V6 standard. The pick up was quite a difference between the two vehicles.The difference in mileage between the two was not that much either. The windstar got I think 18 in the city and 23 on the highway. With the Sedona it's 15/20.

Some of the other features that the Sedona has is rear climate control, ten cup holders, middle and back seats that recline, flexible seating arrangements, two glove boxes, a locking drawer under the front passenger seat, privacy glass, power locks and windows, a sunglass holder, and a place for us to store our CD's.

Mike was impressed. He liked the van more and more as we drove and looked at it. In talking to our salesman we found out that they were running a special of 1.9% financing. That deal has since expired but other deals are happening all the time. We had them see what they would give us for our Windstar and it was a couple of hundred more than what we owed on it. Mike told Jim to draw up the papers. 

Just to let you know what we ended up with was the LX model. It has cloth seats and a solid bench seat in the middle. The one we test drove had two bucket seats in the middle. I found that it was difficult to get anyone to the very back seat. We always drive with extra passengers so that was important to us. We also got a CD player instead of a cassette player. The back bench seat is a split seat so you can remove one or both of the sections. You can also remove the middle bench seat and move the rear seat to the middle. One thing that we gave up was cargo space. It is much smaller than the Windstar. But we did go for a weekend trip with four adults and two children and had space for all of our things. It was just a little tighter.

We are not one to quibble over price. It makes us both tense and we felt with the finance rate we were getting a good deal anyway.It also comes with a limited 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Bumper to bumper is 5/60,000. Paint and radio are only 3 years or 36,000 miles. Also road side assistance. After fighting with Ford over their warranty we did not feel you could beat the package KIA had. So we paid sticker. You might be able to get a better 
price than we did though. Over all we have been thrilled 
with our purchase. The ride is smooth and comfortable. 
Anyone in the market for a mini van should go and take a 
spin in the Sedona. I can find nothing to complain about so 
far in the seven weeks of ownership. 

One more brief note. The parent company of KIA might be more familiar to you. It's name is Hyundai.
