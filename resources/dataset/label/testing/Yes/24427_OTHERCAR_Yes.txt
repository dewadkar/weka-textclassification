            I purchased the DSC-S50 because it's a great overall design, ergonomic with a balanced feature array. Especially nice is the 2&quot; LCD that can be protected from scratches when not in use and can swivel up above the body as well.

This Cybershot model has a clear, bright LCD (plus a brighter/normal capability) but no standard non-lcd viewfinder, something needed in dark indoor conditions. The li-ion battery is small, yet holds enough power for approx three hours of shooting. A 4 meg memory stick comes standard-buy a bigger one. At max resolution a 16 meg stick only holds about 15 images.

In play mode you can preview single views of stored images, or nine at a time in index mode. Plus you can also shoot and view 5 second mpeg videos with sound using this model.

However, this may not be the camera for you if you shoot action or high speed events. There is a long delay from pressing (activating) the shutter and the actual image capture, often resulting in an late image. Unless you are quite adept at panning with the subject this is often the case.

Also, it is important to have a USB connection to the PC. Although Sony has a floppy adaptor ($79.99) for it's memory stick media it is flimsy and the battery covers are easily broken. Plus the warranty dept has more demand for them than supply; I was told to wait almost a month for this two-cent part.

But overall the 2 meagpixel results are excellent. It is comfortable in the hand, and has many effects and capabilities available through it's easy to navigate menu via the LCD. And the DSC/S50 is well priced compared to the rest of the fast maturing market for higher resolution digital cameras. For the non-professional this easy to learn camera has good results and will certainly make this Sony Cybershot a best seller.
