            This was my first brand new car. My choices were somewhat limited due to budget and trade-in, but I decided on the Cougar.

Overall, I have been very pleased with car in terms of reliability. I average about 35,000/year and the car was mechanically flawless. Very very reliable and very few problems - mostly minor things.

The only major work ever done was to have the transmission replaced after 120,000 miles, but other than that, no major problems whatsoever.

My complaints deal with power and mileage. My previous car was a Thunderbird Turbocoupe which was a real powerhouse. The 6 cylinder Cougar is so underpowered it's ridiculous. The car is simply too heavy for the engine. The engine makes a nice throaty noise on take off, but don't let that fool you - it's a dog all the way. It rides smooth, but no power to speak of.

Next complaint is mileage. The BEST I've ever gotten was 25 miles per gallon and that was non-stop highway driving without the A/C! My average mileage is about 15 city and 20 highway and about 18 overall. Pitiful pitiful.

However, the car has been SO reliable and I've racked up so many miles (165,000), that I'll just hang on to it til it dies. Besides, it's been paid for for a year and half.

I'd never buy another Cougar (I think the newest ones are very ugly). My next new vehicle will be a Lincoln LS.....
