            I bought my 1990 Ford Escort for $200, drove it for a summer, loved it, wrecked it, got the frame straightened, and this car still runs like a dream.  This car is still my little baby.  If I was going to recommend a small, common, inexpensive car, this is it.  Any type of Escort, any year, they're great.  The engine shimmy's a little, but only cause I wrecked it.  Other than that she's still a little runner and will probably never stop running.
Before I owned it this car got close to about a three thousand a month put on it, and I put a few thousand on it myself before I wrecked, and I've got back to about two hundred a week.  I still drive this thing to school, work, and my girlfriends house.  It's great for going around town, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Keep rockin Escort !<br><br>
