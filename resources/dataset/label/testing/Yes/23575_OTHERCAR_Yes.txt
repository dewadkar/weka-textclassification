            When I first heard Lexus was planning to offer a small, rear-wheel-drive sedan powered by a DOHC six, I was ecstatic.  Aside from not offering a manual transmission until 2002 or so, this promised to come close to being my ideal car based on the early information and photos.  I like compact cars, I prefer DOHC sixes over fours for their smoothness, and rear-wheel-drive creates the potential for a more balanced, more tossable chassis.

Before I describe my impressions of the actual car, some additional background is in order.  Lexus originally made a name for itself by offering cars that were extremely smooth and extremely quiet at prices less than those charged by the Germans.  This formula sold a lot of cars, but parent Toyota was not satisfied.  The automotive press (whose tastes tend to differ from those of the average luxury car driver) kept carping that Lexus were boring to drive, that they isolated the driver too much.  For these auto journalists, BMW made the ideal cars, with excellent performance and unequaled feedback to the driver.  For whatever reason, BMWs have also sold well recently.

So Toyota decided to create some BMW killers.  To go up against the BMW 5-Series, Toyota redesigned the GS to make it more of a performance car and less of an isolation chamber.  (The ES and LS have continued to serve those who prefer to be isolated.)  Overall, the GS has succeeded in this task.  While it still possesses the fluid feeling of a Lexus, it also provides enough feedback to the driver to serve as a credible BMW 5-Series competitor.

This brings us to the IS.  BMW�s core product is their smallest car, the 3-Series.  For worldwide markets, Toyota created the Altezza, a car which is very similar in size to the 3-Series and has a similar chassis configuration, i.e. rear-wheel-drive and nearly equally balanced over the front and rear axles.  The largest engine in the Altezza is a 2.0 liter inline six tuned to produce about 210 horsepower at a very high RPM, much like the engine in the top Celica.  This wasn�t a problem for overseas markets, which like high-revving engines.

But Toyota realized that this wouldn�t work as well in the US.  Americans, especially those who buy luxury sedans, tend to prefer larger engines with more low-end grunt.  So for the US market, they crammed in the 3.0 liter inline six from the GS300.  The power output is about the same, but it�s much more accessible.

Toyota made one more change.  Since they wanted to compete with BMW, they made the car a Lexus.  And priced it like one: $34,000.  While an equivalent BMW will run about $42,000, this is still a serious chunk of change for a small car.  It�s about the same price as the ES300, which is larger and considerably more luxurious.  The idea is people who want luxury will buy the ES, while those who want a true driver�s car will buy the IS.

So, how well does this plan seem to have worked?  Is the IS 300 a legitimate 3-Series competitor?  Is it like buying a BMW for $6000 or so less?  I personally had high hopes.  A test drive brought these crashing to earth.

The problem is not with the performance of the car.  The IS 300 performs very well.  The engine is very powerful throughout the rev range.  It responds quickly to your foot.  And this can only improve once the manual is available (I plan to retest it then).  The handling is sharp, and the car sticks very well in hard turns.  The highly responsive feel of the chassis is enhanced by quick steering and a steering wheel that feels quite small in diameter, somewhat like you�ll find in a race car.   This risks making the car feel darty, but I felt the car both tracked well and responded to the exact degree that I intended.  So top marks for power and handling. The only change I might wish for is a bit less understeer; you cannot steer the car with the throttle to the degree you can the BMW.

If only this were all that the car needed to do.  Well, it would be, if it were a $24,000 car.  But it�s a $34,000 car, so it must do more.  Here it has problems.  To start, it doesn�t feel very luxurious.  It�s not an especially quiet car, and the ride is a bit on the stiff side.  Well, it�s a performance car, right?  Yes, but�the 2001 3-Series is quieter and smoother, and it is certainly also a performance car.  

Quite ironic.  It seems that while Lexus was trying to create its own BMW, BMW was trying to make its car more like a Lexus.  In my review of the 323i I am somewhat critical of this decision on BMW�s part.  The new 3 in base form seemed too much like a Lexus to me.  It�s quietness and smoothness detracted from driving enjoyment.  Luckily, BMW seems to already be rectifying this problem.  The 2001 3-Series in both 325 and 330 form possesses a more involving engine, as I explain in my 330i review.  So BMW is coming very close to providing the best of both worlds in one car.

Still, the IS is not too far off in the ride and quietness department.  Once it has a manual, it may be even more fun to drive than the BMW because it does have more edges.  So why aren�t I happy with it?

To oversimplify for the sake of clarity, the interior is awful.  The design doesn�t quite work, at least not for me.  And it feels like the interior of a car priced in the low 20s.  Let me cover each of these in turn.

Lexus is trying to pitch the IS as a �sufficiently radical� car, and the most radical aspect of the car is the design of the interior.  The instruments are designed like a chronograph and are placed in a tall, narrow binnacle that reminded me of the ones on motorcycles..   The shifter is topped by a chrome ball.  While most lines in the interior are straight to a fault, the shifter bezel and outboard vents are chrome-ringed ovals.  The seats are half leather, half �Ecsaine,� which is supposedly similar to material used in race cars.

I liked how this interior looked in photos and when peering through the window at the auto show.  Sitting in the car, it seems like too many things are going on at once, and even one by one they just don�t look good.  The Ecsaine does do an excellent job holding you in place in hard turns.  But it does not look nearly as good as an all-leather seat would.  I don�t think I would mind as much if the Ecsaine didn�t extend beyond the center panels to include part of the seat cushion bolsters.  The tall and narrow proportions of the instrument binnacle are jarring, both because they are unusual and because the rest of the dash has a strong horizontal emphasis.  It�s somewhat like seeing a person with very broad shoulders and a tall, skinny head.  The outboard vents are chrome-ringed ovals, the inboard ones are plain rectangles.  The door panels lack an contour whatsoever, like those in an economy car.  Perhaps worst of all, the dash is topped by hard black plastic with ribs in it, even in the ivory interior.  This last feature is truly puzzling for me.  It simply looks awful.  Hopefully it doesn't look as bad in the charcoal interior.  And, because the instrument binnacle is so narrow, from the driver�s seat you see a bunch of this stuff on each side of it.   Overall, I get the sense that at least half a dozen people designed this interior, and they didn�t talk to each other.

As if the aesthetics of the interior weren�t bad enough, it also feels on the cheap side.  The plastics tend to be hard to the touch. Many of the trim pieces have a simulated metal finish, but look about as much like real metal as faux wood looks like the real stuff.  These criticisms apply to the chronograph instruments, the various chrome rings, the plastic around the shifter and window buttons, and especially to that swath of black plastic across the top of the dash.  

The intended look and materials recall the interior of the Mercury Cougar.  Since the aesthetics of the Cougar�s interior are far superior, I don�t mind these materials so much there.  That, and the fact that the Cougar is a $20k car.  If you want a futuristic, �sufficiently radical� interior that both looks good and uses luxury car class materials, you�re going to have to get an Audi.

Why did Lexus use such cheap materials in a $34,000 car?  I can think of two reasons.  First, this car is a Toyota selling at a relatively lower price outside the US.  Second, they were aiming at the previous generation 3-Series, the one that was on the market at the time the IS was being developed.  This 3-Series interior did not feel particularly luxurious.  The plastics were hard, and the surfaces were generally flat.  

Unfortunately for Lexus, BMW was a moving target.  Lexus scared BMW into making the interior of the new 3-Series far more luxurious than that in the previous car.  The BMW does cost $8,000 more comparably equipped.  (The base prices are $2,500 apart, but the Lexus comes with more standard, including the automatic transmission I would gladly do without.) But the BMW's interior makes it feel like an entirely different class of car.  Like a luxury car.  Maybe I'm off-base, but once a car's price passes $30k, I expect the car to be luxurious.  Doubly so if it's a Lexus.

Simply put, the IS does not feel like a Lexus. And no amount of &quot;sufficiently radical,&quot; anti-conformist, &quot;we wanted it to be unlike a Lexus&quot; spin-meister blather is going to cover up the fact that this car was branded a Lexus as an afterthought.  This does allow Toyota to charge more for the car, and it does allow Lexus dealers to attract a younger set of customers, but it dilutes the Lexus brand. If this car which differs so much from the core Lexus models really is a Lexus, then what is Lexus?  By straying from its original focus and trying to be many different things, Lexus risks confusing buyers.  If buyers do actually become confused, then the brand will lose a great deal of its value.

The IS 300 recalls the previous 3 in one other way as well: the rear seat is not particularly spacious on comfortable.  At 5�9� I just manage to fit back there, but the seat cushion is quite low.  It provides no thigh support, so my knees flop to the sides.  The rear seat cushion in the new 3 is substantially higher, providing decent if not great thigh support, better contoured, and just plain roomier.  It�s good enough that I wonder if the 5 makes much sense.

I have one other major issue with the rear seat in the IS: it does not fold down.  Instead, there is a small pass-through through the center armrest.  I cannot begin to count the number of times I�ve folded down the rear seats in the two sedans I own to carry items that would not fit in the trunk alone, including a couple of  7� bookcases, a couple of tall file cabinets, and the (dissembled) crib for my daughter.   I cannot imagine getting by without this feature.  This is an option with the BMW, and I highly recommend getting it.  With the Lexus, unless you�re carrying skis or just a couple of 2x4�s, you�re paying and waiting to have the items delivered.

The exterior of the IS is less troubling to me, but it doesn�t do much for me, either.  With the 17� wheels in all the photos, it looks pretty good.  A sharp, aggressive look.  But the car I drove had the all-season 16� tires on it.  With these smaller, less aggressively styled wheels, the IS looks about as special as a Mazda Prot�g� or Honda Civic.  In fact, elements in its shape remind me of these cars, with a bit of Ford Focus thrown in as well.  Ultimately the body styling is too dependent on the wheels for an effect.  You can put nice 17� wheels on a Civic or Protege and get much the same effect.

This is just what many young drivers are doing, especially on the west coast: taking Japanese compacts and tricking them out (&quot;slamming&quot; them).  In the end, the IS 300 is this concept taken to the extreme: it�s a fairly prosaic Japanese compact with a big engine, fine rear-wheel-drive chassis, and boy-racer interior.   It�s not in any way a luxury car.  And it�s not a BMW.  If it were priced in the mid-20s, I�d be tempted to give it five stars despite its shortcomings, because it does perform very well.  But each $5k above that takes it down one star, ending up at three.

At the same time, I still must recommend the car.  But only because there are so few cars of this type.  Namely, the BMW and this car.  If you want a rear-wheel-drive compact, prefer an automatic, the BMW 323i is not powerful enough for you, and you must stretch to even spend $34,000, then the IS is your only choice..  It also helps if the interior somehow appeals to you.   But I�d think long and hard about finding a new or used 3-Series that fits your needs and budget before buying this car.

What I�d really prefer is for other auto makers to offer DOHC six cylinder, sharp handling, rear-wheel-drive compacts.  While the Lexus may look like a bargain compared to the BMW, IMHO both of the current entries are overpriced.  More competition could help this.  I don�t even think the car has to be luxurious as long as it�s priced in the mid 20s.   This isn�t just your all-too-common �the same but cheaper� rant.  Because this is feasible.  The now discontinued Ford Contour with a fine DOHC six sold for under $20k.  Do the same basic car, just on a balanced rear-wheel-drive chassis, and you�re there.  From another angle, if you took a bit of luxury content out of the Lincoln LS and shrunk it down one size/price class, you�d also be there.  If a car company could do this, they wouldn�t simply have my recommendation.  They�d have my money.

Update (8-28-2000): The review of this car at Edmunds.com makes many of the same points.  I especially like their comments on the interior, which I HATED:

&quot;Even a sub-$15,000 Volkswagen Golf GL has more soft-touch interior materials than the IS 300. Rap the textured top of the dash with your knuckles, and it will respond with a plasticky hollow sound. Much of the switchgear seems like it was pulled directly from a Corolla. Not that this is bad, per se (Toyota's controls are always of high quality and easy to use), it's just that we would expect more when paying over $30,000. Our test car even had the $1,705 leather/ecsaine interior trim upgrade package, but nearly everybody on staff would have preferred more leather and less of the perforated faux-suede. Compared to the attractive plastics and supple leathers found inside a BMW, the IS 300's interior materials seem like they were purchased at Target.&quot;
