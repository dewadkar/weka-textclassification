            I bought this camera because of its size, weight and ability to flip the lens and use compact flash card memory. It is light and small enough to fit in my shirt pocket. I use the flip lens all the time to take pictures of me and my family together. The resolution is good enough for most people unless you want to make big enlargements. The lens also doesn't protrude so you can't bang it around. You don't have to worry about lens cap anymore because it flips to protect the lens. I make vcd slide shows or email so I only use 1 meg resolution for 99% of my pictures. Also, gets a lot more pictures in the compact flash card and don't have to wait long for image storage. I never use the download cable to get the pictures in my computer because I use a compact flash card reader which transfers pictures instantly. The quality of the image is good for a camera with this type of lens. At first I wasn't sure if I liked the proprietary battery that you have to use with this camera. But it is lithium ion and the charge lasts a long time and is small in size and light weight. If you leave the camera on the shelf for a period of time, you will most likely still have enough charge to still take pictures even after a month. Not so with NmH type batteries and they don't make rechargable lithium ion batteries in AA size I believe. I would go any other way with batteries now because all my cameras in the past used AA in which I had to keep on charging continuously because it would loose the charge after a few days. I bought a new battery on ebay for $30. With 2 sets of batteries you shouldn't have a problem even on long trips overseas because you will bring the charger with you and just plug it in because it works on 220 volts also. No problem when I was in China. You need the adapter jack though to plug it into the European or Asian plugs. At first I noticed red eye problem but soon discovered the mode to prevent red eye. You got to read the manual. When I take pictures of people I use portrait mode and never had red eye problem again. That is because the flash sequence changes and takes a little longer so the pupils close before the camera takes the pictures. I couldn't believe how well it works actually as I can be close to the face and never saw red eye again. There is slight shutter lag but better than other cameras of this quality. You have to remember to hold the camera study after pressing the button for a couple seconds. This is my 5th or 6th digital camera I owned and is the best one I owned so far. The scene menu is the best feature of this camera in my opinion which enables correction for different types of pictures you may want to take, such as night life, fireworks, party, museum,portrait etc.

Ok, the not so good things about this camera. When used outdoors in the day, it is impossible to see the image in the viewfinder. Sometimes I can make out the outline and have to guess where the rest of the picture is before I take the picture. I am sure they didn't include the viewfinder to save space and make the camera compact. The camera stopped working one day and had to send it in under warranty. The service was fast. They said they had to replace a fuse. I think I may have had a bad CF card and that is why it shorted out. The same thing happened to my Casio except I had to throw that camera away because they wanted more money to fix the camera than what I paid for it. So I threw the suspect card away. CF cards are cheap now and 128mb less than $40. It is better to have a couple of smaller cards instead on one big one in case one card goes bad you still have another one. The camera seems fragile and it seems if you twist the lens in the wrong direction too hard you can break it. Don't let your kids use it. In fact the demo one in the store was broken due to this I believe. It really doesn't spin 360%
