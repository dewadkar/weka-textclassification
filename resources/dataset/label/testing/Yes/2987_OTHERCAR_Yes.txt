            I bought my '93 Jeep Wrangler Sahara in June of 1997 for two reasons: image and capability.  I have always felt that Jeeps give off a certain image of ruggedness and fun-loving.  When the top comes off and the wind is blowing through your hair on a dirt road, it is one of the best values money can buy.

As a off-road vehicle, nothing matches it for the price.  I put some 29 inch tires on it and have been able to go anywhere and do anything I wanted - from shelf roads at Moab and Canyonlands, to the blizzard of 2000 that took over the East Coast.  It has proved reliable in all of these places, discounting the view that Jeeps break down all the time.  I have the 4.0L engine - do NOT go below this.  I have driven the lesser 2.9L and it does not deliver any acceleration or power.

Driving the Jeep, however, is not for those who want a smooth and quiet ride.  The wind whips over the top and is audible at any speed over 45, meaning you shouldn't be doing cross-country trips in it.  (I've done two of them, and it was BRUTAL. But, any time you take it off road, the ride gets smoother and you are in complete control of your destiny.  Further, without the top, I would swear that the interior is quieter.  But, that's just me.  Also, I am 6'4&quot;, 260 lbs, and fit well in it because of its ample headroom created by the vacuum effect on the top when driving (or the hole created sans top)

A note of caution - it has a high center of gravity, so don't try to be Mario Andretti or it will flip.  I have never experienced this due to conservative driving, but it's a small price to pay.

Buy this car if you want something that makes a statement about you and you're willing to deal with gas mileage between 14-18 mpg.  Don't buy it is you can't handle a noisy ride.  (You can eliminate this problem with a hard top, but what's the point then?)  Of course, your passengers in the rear had better be under 5'10&quot;, or they will be seriously cramped.<br><br>
