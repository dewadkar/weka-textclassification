            I purchased a 1999 Olds Alero GLS Coupe about 3 months ago, and I am seriously impressed!

The car not only is luxurious inside (I got every option offered), but its performance rivals any other car I've owned. Having beaten Mustangs, and just creaming about every passenger car on the road, I've gotten a chance to see just exactly what my Alero has been able to do. I've held my ground in the snow, thanks the the All-Season touring tires and ALS, which prevents wheel-spin. I can also have a little fun on Ohio's highways, if you know what I mean. For a person looking for luxury that moves, take a look at the Alero, it's well worth its price. (Mine was about $25,400, with the options)


Right now, I am not aloud to drive my Alero. My license is under suspension until the end of December. 142 MPH in a 60 just doesn't agree with the judge too well...
