               I am in the business of moving horses. I have used several different rigs in the past, Jimmy, Blazer, Suburban, Ford 150, and Chevy 2500 350 V8. The 94 Ram 2500 V-10 is the truck that beats them all. This rig will pull a four horse and you would not know you have a tag along. With a two horse you can drive as if you had an empty truck!
   I get tired of other owners constantly whining about the low gas mileage - for God's sake man you bought a V10 what did you expect! This is no toy truck - it was built for serious work. If you do not have something heavy that you regularly pull - don't buy this truck. It costs you but it gets the job done.
   The truck is absolutely useless in snow in 2 wheel drive. I put my transfer case into 4 high when the first snow flies and don't take it out until the last flake melts.
Extremely poor defrost on side windows and my air conditioning never works. The infinity stereo is OK but mine has been in the shop twice.
   If you need a big rig to do some big work this is your truck - but you will pay big for parts and at the pumps.
