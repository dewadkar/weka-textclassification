            Recently, I rented a 2001 Chevy Malibu LS when my Galant finally decided it had its last outing with me and the transmission went out.
I always had a bad image of Malibu�s, and never paid attention to the new ones because of this �mental image� But anyway, I needed a car, last minute � and that was all Enterprise had available in under 20 minutes.

This review isn�t about the rental car � The rental car is why I decided to buy the 2002 Malibu.
I had my heart set on the new 2002 Lancer, for many reasons that really aren�t important. After driving the rental car for 3 days, I really wanted a Malibu, badly. It was probably one of the best cars I had driven in a long time. Exceeding my happiness with my Galant LS, and the 2001 Mirage (which didn�t completely thrill me) and the list could go on. I decided that my next car would not be a Mitsubishi. Nope, not this time. My dad told me whatever I got � he had to like. Since he would be helping me get it.

The 2002 came with some awesome standard equipment. Nevermind the �optional� sunroof. I could live without that, I never used mine often in my Galant, so it was pointless at the least. 

The features that I liked about the Malibu:
Daytime running lights w/auto lighting at night. (Front/back lights come on when it�s dark without having to turn them on)
Keyless entry. Very nice in a big parking lot at night, which I tend to frequent at work.
The CD player! All I really was concerned with at the time was the color and the Radio. I did not want to have to deal with trying to install my own CD player again. It may be stock, but it sounds awesome. (At least to me.)
It�s a four door. I tend to tote people around, and I�m used to four doors.
Rear door child locks. I have a five-year-old niece that knows how to get out of the car, so this is very nice.
Rear child harness � you can move the regular seatbelt harness down to be used by a child without that nifty �child� thing they sell for like $10 or more at Wal-Mart.
Child safety seat harness hooks. It�s nice to know I�ll be able to tether my little ones into the car. Even though I don�t have any � it�s a nice thought. 
The seats were amazingly comfortable, and compared to my Galant, that was impressive.
After a 4.5 hour road trip, the seats were STILL comfortable! This truly won my heart.
We took a trip to Oklahoma City (from Dallas) for Easter weekend, and it didn't phase me at all. I HATE roadtrips, and I hate sitting still, but even when I wasn't driving, it was still great. There was plenty of room to move around and my back didn't ache like I had been sitting on concrete for hours.

The windsheild wipers were a bit tricky to figure out, but its always different in different cars. 
Setting the radio presets was a snap. You get two FM�s and one AM. 

The trunk was massivly roomy. I will never need that much space, but its nice to know it is there if I do need it.
The roominess was good too. My brother is tall � and every time he had to ride with me, his knees were pressed up against the dash, with his seat pushed all the way back. In this car, he doesn�t have that problem. Theres plenty of room for him, in the front and in the back. Definate bonus � none of my friends are short. Just me.

I�m a girl, so I don�t know a lot about cars � but that doesn�t mean that I am completely clueless. Aside from heck yeah its pretty. This car has much more get up and go with its V6 engine than my Galant did. Even on a good day.
The gas mileage is great. I get about 290 miles to a full tank, and even with gas being $1.17, its still easy on my funds to fill it up.
I don�t know what my city �mpg� is, because I don�t drive much in town. My day is consumed by the highway. I�m in town long enough to get to my house (5 minutes) and 5 minutes back to the highway for work.
The car is quiet when I�m doing 75 on the highway, which I love. 
I used to hate the 15 mile drive to work, but I actually want to get up and drive again. I�ve only not driven somewhere once in the last two weeks since I�ve had this car. My last car, I just let everyone else drive me around.

There are so many more things I could say about this car, but you won't really know until you've driven one yourself. Go to your local Chevy dealership and test drive one. Theres so many more features to this car than I can recall off the top of my head.
