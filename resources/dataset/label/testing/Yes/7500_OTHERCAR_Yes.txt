It came time for me to buy a car.  I wasn't in desperate need of a car, but my 95 Neon was growing long in the tooth with 87,000 (fun) miles on it and the niggles I had come to live with were starting to get annoying.  I initially seeked out an Intrepid or Concorde, but then... this funny thing happened.

I drove the 2.4L Stratus SE.  And I fell in love.  Like most people, I immediately dismissed the four banger and wanted a V6 (although it was out of my price range.)  But, wow!  The thing has pickup.  The 2.5L V6 offers about 13 more horses, but the torque difference is a lot closer, and it shows.  Lots of getup and go in this car, and gas mileage is respectable; I get from 340-390 miles on one tank.

Interior room is very good.  Lots of cubbyholes.  The upfront cupholders won't hold large items, but I can overlook that.  Center console space is huge and very handy.  The seats are a little cushier than my Neon's were, but still very comfortable and very good on long commutes.

And the SE is very fun to drive.  It bites into turns and loves the highways - passing power is right there, and seemingly always on tap.  The instrument cluster is about as good as it gets: gauges are easy to read, day or night; HVAC controls are solid, and the power switches are all in easy reach.

The only downsides?  Well, the tires are a bit weak.  It didn't defer my confidence while driving, but the squeal can be... interesting.  My only major problem is the location of the battery: in the front left wheelwell.  It's not easy to get at.  Jumpstarts aren't a problem, as there are ports in the engine bay, but it takes far too much effort to get to the battery.

The flipside of that is that the oil filter and pan are VERY easy to get at - something I value highly.

All in all, the Stratus is a roomy, fun-to-drive car that is loaded with creature comforts and offers substantial value.  I prefer the looks of the 95-00s over the upcoming 01s (particularly the interior - blecch!), and I'm sure dealers will be anxious to get the 00s out.

<b>Update: February 20 2001</b>

It's been several months now, and I can say that the Stratus remains a competent, comfortable vehicle.  I've taken it on very long road trips and have experienced no discomfort while getting the added bonus of great gas mileage with the 4-cylinder.  However, and this is a highly subjective thing, the car feels like it has no demeanor.  My ol' 95 Neon... that thing had personality.  This doesn't.  It goes about its business and does it well, but I can't honestly tell you that it's not a car that just bowls me over like the Neon did.
