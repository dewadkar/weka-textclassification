            I first learned of the Subaru Impreza 2.5RS when visiting the local Subaru dealer to look at the Outback wagon. I took it for a test drive and fell in love. 

Exterior

The Impreza looks different from anything out on the road today. Especially in the RS trim that I have. It is a somewhat unique looking car. The biggest gripe that I have about the exterior is the paint. It gets light scatches somewhat easier than other vehicles I have owned. Otherwise the car looks good.

Interior

The interior comes in black for the RS model. The seats are reasonably comfortable and the rear seats are not bad for small to medium sized adults. Head room is good both front and rear. Compared to other sporty cars the rear seats are quite good and visibility in the front seats is as good as any car I have driven. My biggest complaint about the interior is that neither front seat slides forward with the flick of a switch to let back seat passengers out easily. There is also a handy seatbelt holder for the front seats that makes the seatbelt easy to reach. It also flips down to let the rear passengers out. The cup holders are odd but actually work well. One is located between the center vents and the climate controls. This is actually a conveniant location for a drink except that it blocks one vent and one climate control switch. Overall the interior is well laid out if a bit odd.

Performance

This is where the car really shines. Handling is very good with accurate steering and a slightly stiff but not harsh ride. Power is what a car should have, not too little and not too much. The torque comes at just about any engine speed so the car is easy to drive around town. Acceleration is good and the all-wheel drive enables full acceleration under control on just about any surface. The car can maintain highway speeds even up steep hills in 5th gear. The shifting is okay but not exceptional. I am getting about 25 mpg in mixed driving. Performance lies somewhere between a sports car and a family sedan with power.

Overall

This is a nice, sporty car. It is not quite a real sports car but is definitely better for the daily drive to work than an economy car. The all weather capability makes it a perfect choice for those who have to deal with snow and/or rain on a regular basis but prefer a car over an SUV.<br><br>
