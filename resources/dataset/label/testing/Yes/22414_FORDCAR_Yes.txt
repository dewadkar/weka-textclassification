                Four months ago leased a black Ford ZX-2.  I had lots of reasons behind this decision... ok, I got it because it was the cheapest possible car I could lease.

    Quick overview of likes and dislikes:
Likes:
Handling and speed - exceptional for a car of this price
Driving - fun experience, especially since mine's a stick-shift
Look - very sporty and modern, and it doesn't LOOK like a cheap car
Windshield wipers - something insane like 12 intermittent settings
AC is standard

Dislikes:
Few &quot;extras&quot;
Car horn - you have to press HARD to honk

Overall opinions - A good little &quot;sporty&quot; car.  It's great for getting to work, and cruising around town.  Enough &quot;pick-up&quot; for good highway driving, and enough style for your friends.

Most importantly - WHO SHOULD BY THIS CAR?!!
The ideal buyer for this car is someone with a tight budget, who wants a nice looking and handling car, with only the basics.  The car comes with NOTHING power (except steering), and no &quot;luxury&quot; features - (included in the list of &quot;amenities&quot; was the ash tray).  If you want things like cruise control, a sunroof, power locks, etc... you'd probably be better off just buying a nicer car.  This ISN'T your car for road trips - you'd need more leg room, more passenger space - and a bigger trunk.  However, if you need to get from point A to point B, and don't feel like stooping to the level of a Hyundai just yet, then check out the ZX2.<br><br>
