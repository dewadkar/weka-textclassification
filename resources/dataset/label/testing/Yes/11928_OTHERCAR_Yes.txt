            You will not find another camera priced around $200, with a LCD viewer and the resolution this Agfa has to offer.
This is the perfect first time digital camera.  It's easy to use, has a cool blue metallic color which everyone seems to love and takes pretty good pictures. The 2Mb card that's included will take 12 pictures at the highest resolution.  These cards are getting cheaper.  Search the net and pick up at least an 8Mb card to give you more flexibility.
One common problem (if you've read the other reviews), are the batteries. To be fair about it, this problem is endemic for all battery operated digital cameras-they all put on a high drain on the batteries. Buy rechargeable batteries and use the viewfinder, not the LCD screen when taking pictures to conserve power.
The software that comes with the camera is fine for a beginner and relatively easy to use.  One thing--if you have a friend with a megapixel (at least a 1.3 megapixel) camera, don't expect the same clarity and sharpness.  If this is very important to you, spend the extra 100-200 bucks.<br><br>
