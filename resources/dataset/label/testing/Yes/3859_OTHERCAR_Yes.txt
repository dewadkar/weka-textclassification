            Well I got my '99 Yukon back in November of '99 .  I've been extremely pleased with the car...I mean what's negative about it?  It's good great looks.  The styling is pretty conservative and basic, but it's a great looking car.  The Yukon is a little more extravagent than the Tahoe with the nice rounded GMC grill.  A little known fact about the Yukon is that they are not a slow car.  The 5.7 Litre V8 packs a stock 255 bhp and 330 lb-feet of torque stock, even more if you have the heavy duty towing package.  You could probably run a 0-60 in just a bit over 8 seconds which is among the fastest SUV's.  Excluding the GMC Typhoon of course (it's twin turbo and 0-60 in 5 seconds!)The only negative I've found about this car is that I think I am going to have to replace the universal rear fasteners because I am getting some sort of squeak in the rear.  This is a car I would highly recommend!<br><br>
