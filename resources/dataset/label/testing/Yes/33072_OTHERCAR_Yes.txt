            My GMC Sonoma is a good little truck, however there are better ones out there for a much better price.  My little bunny's sticker price was almost $22,000 and isn't even four wheel drive!  
I've had a few problems with little things in my truck such as inoperative door handles, inoperative defrost and such, otherwise she runs pretty well.  I drive 30,000 miles a year and it still drives like new.
I wouldn't recommend the v-6 if you don't need it, since the gas mileage isn't that great, figure around 20mpg on the highway unloaded, and 17mpg in the city.  A friend of mine has the four cylinder and says it has more than enough power.
Also, if you like to hug corners well, I highly recommend the ZQ8 suspension package.  I have it, and I just zing around the corners and curves in the road.  Yes, it rides rough, however this is a truck, and it rides rough regardless.
If you are over 6 feet tall, shell out the extra cash for the extended cab.  Without it, you can't scoot your seat back very far.
I live in Indiana, and we've had a few snowstorms this year.  Even with the fatter tires (P235 50/R16) I haven't had too many problem, even without any weight in the back.  
If you like the styling, go ahead and buy a Sonoma.  I like it, but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably buy a Ranger or a Tacoma.<br><br>
