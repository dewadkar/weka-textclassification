            The Saab 9-3 is a total hoot to drive.  We tested the BMW 323i, Volvo S70, Audi A4 and Saab 9-3, and the Saab was the most fun to drive of them all -- which is not to say it was the BEST, but the most fun.

The standard 185-hp turbo four and 5-spd manual transmission make this car go like a rocket once the boost builds up.  Off idle, there's no power at all, but when the revs pass 2,000 there's a whoosh and a rush of speed.  Unlike most manual-shifters, this one won't let you muff a take-off -- you can't simply let out the clutch to start the car rolling, it'll stall unless you give it gas.  If you work for it, you're rewarded with quite a ride, though.

Storage space was a big plus in this hatchback.  The cargo area is simply cavernous compared to the other cars we tested.  Unfortunately, this doesn't carry through to the passenger area.  My wife and I were rubbing shoulders in a car that is actually fairly wide on the outside.  Also there's no center armrest.  The driving position was rather strange, in that the driver's seat aims your body to the left, yet the steering wheel angles at you slightly from the right -- the horn button isn't directly in front of you, the left rim of the wheel is, or at least it seems that way.

The interior was put together with quite a bit of care, but the tan materials stained very easily just from the average soil on our shoes.  In quirky Swedish fashion, the ignition key for the Saab is between the seats on the floor, by the emergency brake and the shifter.  You have to put the car into reverse to be able to remove the key, as well.  Saab has said that putting the key there makes for less hand motions when starting, as your hand is already down there to release the parking brake and put the car in gear.  I found it interesting, but when I stalled the car at an intersection, I had to sit through a cycle of the light while I figured out the correct combination of gearshift position and clutch in/out position to restart the motor.  

Another quirky/neat feature was their &quot;black panel&quot; setting for the dashboard.  With one button, all interior lights except for the speedometer are extinguished, to help preserve your nightvision while driving after dark.  Indicators and gauges light up individually if they require attention.

The car handles quite well, although the body leans a lot.  Once the body &quot;takes a set,&quot; the car clings to turns.  Freeway onramps, combining a long sweeping curve and a chance to really accelerate, were a blast.  My wife also had an absolutely great time point-and-shooting around a quiet residential neighborhood near the dealership.  The 9-3 does both highway and city driving with competence.

Styling is typical Saab &quot;love it or leave it.&quot;  We loved it, but your mileage may vary.  Saab says they made over 1,000 changes to the 9-3 line for the 1999 model year to address some known concerns.  Saabs are also not greatly known for their reliability...no glaring problems, but the car is only rated at an average level of reliability.

Overall, while we really liked driving the 9-3, we decided that we just couldn't deal with the cramped interior and the sketchy reliability history, and that our licenses probably couldn't deal with the turbocharger.<br><br>
