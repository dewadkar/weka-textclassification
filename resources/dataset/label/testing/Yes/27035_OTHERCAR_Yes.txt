            I bought the Olympus D-450 Zoom because I liked the styling and the many features the camera had for the price.  I bought it about 30 days ago for about $500.00.

The camera is very easy to use.  If you can use a standard 35mm camera, this camera will be very familiar to you.  It looks and feels just like one, except for the small color screen on the back.  One of the best features is the ability to see the picture you just took and tell if it came out good, or if you need to retake it.

It comes with an 8mb chip that allows you to take up to 122 pictures in standard resolution, 36 in high rez, and 18 in super high rez.  A larger capacity chip would have been nice to allow more high rez photos.  All software was also included to allow you to &quot;develop&quot; your pictures at home.

Picture quality is outstanding as well.

I shopped around quite a bit comparing to Kodak, HP, and several other makes.  This camera had the best combination of value, styling, and ease of use.  Save yourself some time and get the Olympus.<br><br>
