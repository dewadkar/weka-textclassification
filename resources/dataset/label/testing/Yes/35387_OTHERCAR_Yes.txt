            I personally don't own this car, but my grandfather bought one during his mid-life crisis. I frequently helped him empty his tank. Red lights seem longer for two reasons in this car.

1. It's so quick and nimble that driving is no longer a chore, but a true joy. Red lights become bothersome and dreadfully long. While waiting you long for the wind to wrap around the windshield and grace your face. Sometimes driving this car made me extremely frustrated at the amount of time waiting at lights.

2. Waits at red lights are actually longer. This car is such a lightweight that it often doesn't trigger the sensor for stoplights. Especially when trying to turn left on a protected light. It just stays red forever, figuratively and literally.

The car has excellent luxury and comfort in true mercedez-benz style. The drivers seat is fully adjustable in directions I would never have imaged necessary.

This is a great sports car, just avoid red lights. But be careful, there is a terribly temptation to run them.<br><br>
