            The newly redesigned 2000 FORD Taurus seems to be a hot little number these days.  Taurus sales completely hit the toliet these past few years, most say due to it's &quot;oval&quot; styling.<br>The 2000 Taurus has some wonderful features such as:<br><br>* Emergency interior trunk release with glo-in-the-dark handle<br>* Child seat tether anchors (enhance child protection)<br>* Power adjustable pedals (for that smaller driver)<br>* Optional front seat side impact bags<br>* Dual-stage airbags (they deploy in a manner that relates to the severity of impact)<br>* An available 3.0-liter 24 valve V6 ( a smooth 200 hp )<br><br>The Taurus will go 100,000 miles before a tune-up and has many other features you need to check out if your in the market for a midline vehicle.<br><br>This car drives smooth and I feel it is one of the most comfortable cars I've ever driven, even over a luxury class.  The redesign was much needed and FORD kept the 2000 pricing right in line with the '99 models.<br><br>Taurus has always boasted more rear leg room and trunk cargo space than the Camry &amp; Accord and their right, the car is roomy!<br>Service records indicate that this car is not coming back to the dealer for service problems.<br>A little birdie told me they can't keep these on the lot, they are selling as quick as they are delivered to the dealership.<br><br>FORD has my thumbs up for giving this old name a new face!!<br><br>-Check out my other Ford reviews on the new Focus and the Excursion-<br><br>(My opinion is based on driving this car for a week and my knowledge of FORDS comes from previous sales of them and my husband who is management for a FORD dealership)<br><br><br>
