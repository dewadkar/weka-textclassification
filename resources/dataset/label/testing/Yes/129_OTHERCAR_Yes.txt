            2 months ago, I purchased the Fuji MX-1200 camera at Fry's electronics, simply because the price was right. I can honestly say I am thrilled with my decision, the camera works beautifully! It has a wide range of options you can choose right on the small digital display on the back, and picture quality is truly amazing! I still have yet to buy another smartmedia card (it came with a 4mb card), because it lets me hold about 12 images, and i can download them anytime to my computer fairly easily. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality digital camera at an affordable price.<br><br>
