            STRENGTHS:
Great Camera, lots of useful features, very good price, very easy to use (point and shoot).

WEAKNESSES:
The 1/4 format (800X600), does not work for me, Not even in the 'BEST" mode. I have to use the 1600X1200 all the time, even in 'GOOD' mode, to get the quality I want/need. I/You have to remember to wait for the green light to come on telling you the camera is focused, then press down on the shutter all the way to take a picture. Some of my pictures came out blury because I forgot to wait for the camera to focus before taking a picture.

SUMMARY:
I'm a second generation photographer, that loves Olympus products, and choosing an H.P. product over an Olympus product was hell for me to decide. This is the first H.P. product I've ever bought. A lot of people have asked me, if I wanted to buy a camera, why not buy a camera from Olympus or Nikon. Well, one of the hard decisions I had to make was realizing, Olympus & Nikon, Do Not make computers. I believe that 95% of a digital camera is computer base, and 5% is optical base. So H.P. & Pentax was a great combination for a digital camera. Mind you, if Olympus or Nikon bought out a new computer, made 100% by them selves, would any one even think of buying one? All I can say is, I've looked around Mississauga (Canada), looked around by my mom in Florida (U.S.A.), looked around the internet, and for a 2-3meg. camera that's under $500US., this is the 'Best Bang For The Buck'. Although I might never buy another product from HP again, I might buy another camera from them! I've spent years holding & focusing my Olympus 35mm SLRs that it's time for a fully automatic digital camera. I picked up some nice stuff for my HP C618 in the U.S. if any one is interested. HP wants's $79 Canadian for the A/C power cord. You can get a universal replacement at Walmart in the US. for under $16US. The Panasonic NiMh AA rechargeable batteries (1600ma) cost $15 for a set of 2 in Canada, you can get the Ray-O-Vac NiMh AA (1600ma) for under $16US for a set of 4 at Walmart in the US. also. You get a 16mb. CompactFlash card with the camera, and in Canada HP has a promotion 'mail-in rebate', and they'll send you a 32mb. CompactFlash card. If you want more memory, check out Costco in the US. They have the 64mb. CompactFlash card for $59US & the 96mb. CompactFlash card for $85US. This is the best prices I've seen for CompactFlash cards yet. I bought the 64mb. CompactFlash card.

UPDATE.- July/29/01
It's been 2 months since I started using my 618 now, and after using it in Toronto & Florida, taking about 1000 pictures, one fine day while it was in it's case, it slipped out of my hand and fell. After opening the case, I saw the battery cover came apart from it. As it is under warranty I called Future Shop and they told me to bring it in and it could take up to 30 days for me to get it back, I said 'No Way, I use my camera almost every day', so they said to call H.P. direct. After speaking to a few people there and getting the correct department to call, they said to send it courier to them next day service and they will pay for the courier. So I did, they kept it for 48 hours and sent a brand new one back to me, free of charge.

Boy was I surprise with such fantastic service. I had told them it was just the battery cover which is held in place by 2 plastic ends, to send me the cover and I'll snap it in place myself, but they said I'll have to send the camera to them. Well, I'll have to be extra careful of handling the camera, the service to me, is amazing. As  for the extra $115, taxes included I paid Future Shop for the extra warranty for an extra 2 years, making it a total of 3 years warranty and they told me I'll be dealing directly with them, I'll have to look into that some more before I'll advise anyone to take the extra warranty.
