            I swore I wouldn't do it...I was too young, heck, not even 30 yet - I was NOT going to get a minivan!  Well, I did, had to as a matter of fact.  We were going to get a SUV when I got pregnant with our second child.  The &quot;cool, hip, yuppie&quot; version of a family car.  Only, it's really not so much a family car.  Once you put two car seats in it, it's the same as a four door sedan.  There's no room for anyone else.  So much for cool and hip!!

I finally broke down, decided I had to do it, but I was never gonna be happy about it.  I would look to OLD!!!  Well, I was WRONG,WRONG, WRONG!I got the 1997 Mercury Villager GS, and I LOVE IT!!  I can take 2 kids and the dog out, and still have room for the playpen, or anything else.  When my in-laws visit we can all ride in the same car (well maybe that's not a selling point, but you get my meaning!).

There are a few drawbacks to this model.  We have quad captains chairs, and there is a design flaw here.  The 1997 was not available with 2 sliding rear doors, and it is nearly impossible to get to the back seat.  The Captains chairs do fold up for easy entry, but we have TWO car seats.  So, whoever sits in the very back seat has to crawl through the middle.  Needless to say, it's usually me!  I do love the fact that my boys can't &quot;fight&quot; with each other with the Captains chairs, they are too far apart.  

We got the fully loaded version, power everything, and this sometimes poses a problem.  See, my van is possessed!!  Every once in a while it locks and unlocks all by itself.  Sometimes it only does this one time, otheres, maybe 5 or 6.  The problem is I can NEVER leave my keys in the car.  FORD is aware of this problem, it is common, but refuses to fix it since my car has over 36,000 miles on it.  NOT A PLUG for Ford here, I am not happy about that!!

Aside from those two drawbacks, this van is great!  It drives like a car, gets better gas mileage than a SUV, and I even moved to full size couches in it!  I would definately recommend DUAL AIR!  It comes with a child lock, so little fingers can't turn it on full blast.  This van also has more cup holders and storage compartments than even I know what to do with!

Since I had to drive a MOMMY MOBILE, I am very glad it got to be as pleasurable as the Mercury Villager!<br><br>
