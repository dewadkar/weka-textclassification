            WOW! This is a pickup!? I'd been looking at pickups for a while, but never could see myself paying big bucks for that payment. When I went to look at the Dakota's I had made up my mind the price was right and I loved the look. After test driving one, I was hooked! If your dream truck is a Ram, but it's just too pricey, then the Dakota has your name on it. As far as the maintenance on this little jem....well, there just isn't any. I've put 35K on it already, and all I've done is change the oil and rotate the tires. The dodge dealership that services my truck is in a class all by itself. They are GREAT! The service tech's know everything there is to know about this truck, and they don't jerk you around on when it will be finished either. Like the commercial says....&quot;In a class by itself&quot;. There dead on!<br><br>
