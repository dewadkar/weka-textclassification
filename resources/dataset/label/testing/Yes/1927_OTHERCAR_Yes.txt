            Nissan definitely has surpassed its own high standards this time with their latest model in the Maxima product line.  I personally drive a 1997 Maxima, my father drove a 1996 Maxima, and now my brother drives a 2000 Maxima.  I love my 1997 model because it has responded in fine fashion to all the rigorous tasks that I have pushed upon it.  I have driven it during the roughest of weather during my trips to Michigan, Illinois, and New Jersey.  My Maxima has endured horrible snowy conditions on the highways, as well as deep snow on back roads.  Also during the last 3 years I have driven it on long journeys without ever having a problem.  On several occasions I have driven it from College Park, Maryland to Chicago, Illinois having only stopped for gas (the trip is roughly 750 miles total).  Nevertheless, the Maxima's performance does not only focus on its engine reliability.

The comfort of the vehicle itself is outstanding.  I am 6'2&quot; so I require quite a bit of space in a car.  The Maxima has met and surpassed my needs easily by providing a roomy interior for both the front and rear seats.  The seats themselves are also pleasant for driving long distances (which I tested quite a bit with my repeated 11.5 hour trips mentioned above).  I have found also that the car's electrical system can handle quite a bit of abuse from electrical upgrades.  In my car I have installed more car audio equipment than most people can fathom.  For those that do know about this sort of thing, I can say that the amplifiers running in my car require a combined 140 amperes of current from the alternator.  Using the stock Maxima alternator has provided me with no problems at all - surprisingly to say the least.

Overall I must say that the good people at Nissan Motors have definitely found a method that &quot;clicks&quot; well when it comes to building a quality automobile.  My Maxima has tested the extremes in reliability, comfort, and performance, while coming out with a smile after it was all said and done.<br><br>
