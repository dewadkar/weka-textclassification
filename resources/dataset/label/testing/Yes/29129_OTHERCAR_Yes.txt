            I searched for a long time for a digital camera and narrowed it down between the Sony Mavica (7x) and the Kodak DC220.  Because, as I understood it, there are some file compressions (with loss of resolution) that occurs as the Sony writes to disk, I decided on the Kodak.  I have been VERY happy with this camera.  It was very easy to use and set up.  The picture quality is spectacular, but only if you set it at its highest resolution.  As with all cameras that use a compact flash storage media, the higher the resolution, the fewer pictures that can be stored on the media.  Therefore, I have it set at a medium resolution (still with impressive results).  The only 2 things that really bothers me is 1) Battery life &amp; 2) Information display accuracy.  While I now understand that this is true for all cameras that have a view screen, the DC220 SUCKS the battery life almost instantly when reviewing pictures on the view screen.  I have probably spent more on batteries than would have on the rechargeable battery upgrade that is available.  I wish this info was available before I made my purchase.  Also, the informational display that shows battery life is very inaccurate.  It will show that the batteries are totally dead one minute and fully charged the next.  This is very annoying.  All in all though...I think it takes excellent picture and has superior price/performance over similar digital cameras.<br><br>
