            The review without the goo.

My wife picked out this pickup for me when it was brand new in 1997.  She traded my 95' model off before I got home from work one day.  I came home and she said - &quot;get all your stuff out of your pickup&quot; and I did.  Off we go to the dealer to trade again.

We went down and took possession of the new one and I was seduced.  I thought the looks were fresh.  The feel was solid and the ride was so smooth compared to the old twin I-beam suspension.  I was real happy about the new pickup.  I loved the three door thing.  I found that to be very accommodating.

Well I have had the thing for approximately 3 years now.  It's time to say goodbye to her.  She made a few promises she kept and some failed ones too.  I suppose we are all guilty of that.  Even vehicles tell lies occasionally.  My father was skeptical saying - &quot;never buy the first year model run, they got bugs to work out.&quot;  I sort of think we should have listened to that this time around.  Oh well, my beautiful wife listens to one voice - her own.

The promise of 17 to 22 mpg fell a little short.  I imagined that the little engine (4.2L V-6) would be more efficient that it has been.  I averaged approximately 14 mpg for the 47000+ miles.  I pampered her like a mistress but she squeals a bit now.  I haven't had her in the dealership for a while but I suspect the bushings and ball joints are shot.  When I am moving very slow as in parking lots every turn of the wheel is followed by the sounds of skweeks from the front end geometry.  There aren't any grease certs.  I think that's a real poor point.  Growing up we were taught that a grease cert was like a dog and needed to be fed often.  This danged thing can't be fed grease like the old ones could.  It can be fed lots of gas but just teeny, tiny bits of grease.

Another little gremlin is her hesitation to turn off the interior lights. She also can't make up her mind whether there is a door ajar or not.  Electronics are great but when they get a bug they can be pretty shocking.  I've been told that any sensor goes bad or has a bad day the electronics will go goofy.  I suppose we will find out in a few days when we retire this old girl.

Anyway, I do like the pickup but I think after a measly 47000 miles she ought to be in better shape.  It's sort of like marriage if you ask me - one bad marriage doesn't mean all women will take you to the cleaners when the romance is over.  This old pickup just feels weak to me and I don't drive the hound out of 'em like I used to when Mom &amp; Dad were footing the bill.  My guess is that I'll be getting another one or maybe one of those cool new Mitsubishi Montero Sports.  I don't know.  It's a tough decision that I'm sure my wife will have to make.  Who knows, maybe she'll go for one of those as yet seen by my eyes - Ford Explorer SportTracs.  I wouldn't be heart broken if I got another F150 though.  They can be as comfortable as a Lincoln Towncar.<br><br>
