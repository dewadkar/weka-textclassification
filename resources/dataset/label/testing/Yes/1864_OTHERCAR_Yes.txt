            Two years ago, when I first drove by my '92 Grand Am at the used car dealer up the street from my house, I pulled into the lot on a whim.  I just had to look at it for a moment.  I had no intention of buying a car at the time, but still...the shiny green/blue color and sleek body drew me in.  

I had never owned a car newer than an '87 and as far as I've seen, they all tend to be a bit boxy.  Even my beloved mustang didn't quite have the body that I was looking for (though it was my first car and therefore, by far, my favorite). 

This Grand Am though, with those perfectly rounded curves...perhaps it was the fact that it was valentines day and found myself alone, trying to compensate for something.  I don't know.  I just decided right there that I had to have it.

I drove back home to get my mother.  I had never bought a car myself before and she'd been through it, so I felt I needed her help.  She was reluctant to help me until she saw the car for herself.  Four hours and a lot of bargaining later, it was mine.

The car was reasonably cheap with my trade-in.  I think I ended up paying about $2000 for it.  I checked recently and the Kelley Blue Book quotes $5460.00 as a retail value.  

I drove from Boston to Phoenix about six months after I bought the car and I didn't have one ounce of trouble the whole time.  It held up beautifully.  Even since then, I have spent fairly little on the car, with the exception of normal wear and tear of breaks and a faulty battery bought from sears (an opinion on them soon to follow).  

One thing that I did have problems with though was the electrical system. I really can't say much on that because I never had it fixed (too expensive). 

I will tell you that it was a very strange experience though.  The first thing that went was the light in the trunk.  It kept staying on after the trunk closed, therefore draining my battery.  That was no problem.  The mechanic found out what it was and then disconnected it for free.

The next thing though was my horn.  I went to start the car one morning and every time I turned the wheel, my horn would just blare.  I couldn't do anything and had to get to work, so I disconnected the fuse.  Now, a horn shouldn't work after you take the fuse out, but a few nights later I got a call from the cops telling me to get down to my car right away.  Turns out, my horn had been blaring nonstop for three hours straight.

Luckily, a neighbor came out and knew what to disconnect under the hood to make it stop.  It was a big hassle, but it never happened again after that.  I've been without a horn ever since.

All in all though, I'd have to say the car was worth every penny that I spent on it.  I hate to admit that I am thinking of trading it in soon, only because of the upcoming move to Colorado.  This is certainly not a car to be gallivanting over bumpy dirt roads with.  (I've done it and it's pretty uncomfortable, though it did run well for not being an off road car).
