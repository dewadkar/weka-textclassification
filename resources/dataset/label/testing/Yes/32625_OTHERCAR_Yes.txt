            The Pontiac Sunfire was the first car I had ever really liked the look of.
The front headlights and rear-fascia gave it an aggressive, sporty appearance that few cars in its class have.

Sporting a 125HP 2.2l 4-cylinder engine, my Sunfire SE coupe has been great ever since I got it.  It has a 5-speed transmission which I learned to drive manual on and has been great!  Though the car may seem to have a small engine, it can easily travel at 160km/h without any problem.  The Sunfire GT's bigger engine will just get you to that speed quicker.

A twin of the Chevy Cavalier, you will pay more for the Sunfire, partly because of its more extensive cosmetic styling and because fewer of them are produced, which makes them a more unique car than its relative.  Because its a domestic vehicle, parts for it are common and cheaper than what you would pay for similar imports (Civics, Tiburons, etc).

My car came with a stock Delco (GM brand) CD player with four speakers.  Two 6x9s are installed in the rear deck and a 4x6 in each of the two front doors.  These speakers are easily replaced with better sounding after-market speakers if you so desire to do so, as I did.  The factory deck though is more than capable and integrates well into the vehicle's dash.

I was also lucky enough to get a Sunfire with the optional powered moonroof.  When closed the glass plate still allows light into the vehicle, but if you wish to stop that a solid screen sits below it which can be closed and makes the inside appear similar to that of a Sunfire without a moonroof.  Unlike Asian and European imports, the moonroof sits above the back of the car's roof when opened instead of hiding below the roof.  This allows the moonroof to be larger, a good thing.  The stock audio system is still audible, even when the moonroof is wide open.

The car doesn't feel cramped, at least up front, but it isn't as spacious, obviously, as sedans and bigger touring vehicles.  There is still more than enough room in the front even for two large adults, though the back isn't terribly comfortable unless you are pretty small.

While my SE lacked the power windows and power windows options, it does have the factory 15&quot; aluminum rims.  To be honest, these are gorgeous rims and look fantastic when polished and when their is some &quot;tire wet&quot; spray on the rubber.  I have gotten many compliments on them from people who are shocked to find out that they came with the vehicle.  If you are in the market for a used 95-99 Sunfire, look for these rims, they are a big improvement over the plastic wheel covers that you would otherwise receive.

Like many modern vehicles, most of the car's lower body paneling is flimsy and plastic feeling.  I can forgive this, though only because it is such a common practice in the compact car market in general these days.
Still, it polishes, washes, and waxes just like any other part of the car.

Both a driver and passenger airbag are installed at the front of the car and more than ample trunk space is available, and can be increased if you pull down the rear seat.  If you live in a State or Province where front plates aren't required, you are lucky because the car's front end looks even more modern and aggressive.  Sadly, I live in British Columbia where front plates are mandatory.

Travelling through corners, even at quick speeds is possible as there is very little body roll and the handling is accurate in most any condition.
I do recommend the 5-speed model be paired with the 2.2l engine simply because I don't believe an automatic transmission would be able to get every ounce of HP out of the relatively small engine as the manual transmission does.  I don't think pairing an automatic transmission with the 2.4l engine would be a problem though.

My biggest complaint about my Sunfire is its rear-ward visibility.  It is, to be honest, pretty terrible!  The car's flashy spoiler eats up a huge chunk of the image in the rear view mirror and makes using it hard when sunlight hits it.  The rear side windows and smaller than those on the Cavalier and I have no idea why.  They do look better though.  I plan to put new springs in my car at some point that will drop it 1.75&quot;,  giving it an even sporty appearance, and hopefully increase the visibility out of the rear wind shield.  I'll post the results.

I love this car, and I don't think I could have made a better choice for a my first vehicle.  I got it used and even then there are no problems, and nothing mechanical has had to be fixed or replaced.
