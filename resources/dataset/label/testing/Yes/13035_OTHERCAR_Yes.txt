            My family has always been fans of Volvos. My sister had a 940 and my dad recently bought himself a S70. So when I decided to dish out $43,000 for the new Volvo S80 T-6 I had a feeling it would be a worthy investment. The twin turbos produce a mouthwatering 268 horsepower that will launch this Swede to 60 MPH in 6.5 seconds. Unlike the previous models, the S80 is not as &quot;boxy and boring&quot; ; there are curves, like a fine woman you can't get enough of. The sport appeal is noticed in its engine, which includes a Semi-Manuel mode, yet this Volvo is German-like luxurious. Dual-climate zones, 8 way power heated front seats, rear vents, navigation system, multifunction steering wheel; it's all here. But Volvo has not forgotten the primary concern: Safety. The S80 exemplifies that by incorporate an inflatable curtain, that stems across the length of the car to protect occupants heads. The power folding rear head restraints are my favorite, allowing a clearer view out of the rear. The ride is incredible, it feels as if you are flying yet you feel completely in control. Five months of ownership and my T-6 is trouble free and a kick to drive. I guess this was a good investment.<br><br>
