            The truck I bought: 2001 solar yellow desert runner.

In short, this truck is freakin awesome if you drive a lot and want a comfortable ride with all the comforts and style of a well appointed car, but with the carrying and towing capacity of a truck.

The best review I read of this truck prior to buying it (meaning the one that I still agree with after having owned the truck for 3 months) said "This is a great truck if you spend most of your time in town, but occasionally need to haul a refrigerator or stove too."  Of course I am paraphrasing, but that is the gist.  And the truth.  

Let me describe the truck I own:  Solar Yellow, King Cab, SE v6 with power package (power windows, locks), luxury package (leather steering wheel, bucket seats, 6 cd changer, sub woofer etc) and many other options.  

The desert runner designation is a package nissan offers that incorporates many (otherwise) expensive options in a single truck.  You get power entry, a decent stereo, power windows, an adjustable steering wheel, a four-wheel drive chassis (truck is NOT 4wd, tho), color matched body components (mirrors, fendors), step rails, bed liner etc. etc.

I paid 19,785 OTD for mine.  I checked out all the other truck companies first, and no one even begins to approach this package at this price.  With chevy's S10 series, for 20 grand you get the truck..That's it.  No bed liner, no power options, no cd player, nothing.  Same story down the line, with Toyota being the worst.  To be fair, toyota also makes the most powerful and toughest truck in this category.  Which means exactly squat to me, since I never ever go off road, and the nissan gets me to the snow just fine, even in two wheel trim.

I have yet to want for power (170 horses is plenty), passing is never a problem.  Considering the bargain price, I am more than pleased with the option package.  If you bought this truck stock and added all the options that come standard with the desert runner model you would spend well over 3 grand.  

The downsides?  Paint chips rather easily (I got touch up paint for 5 bucks from the dealer, problem solved), truck is definitely not made for offroad use, gets a little squirrly in the snow.  That's about it for me.

This is not a truck for hardcore "truck men".  Of course, hard core "truck men" usually drive one of those totally ridiculous Chevy Ram Ford GMC Like a Rock gas guzzling breakdown every two months look like junk run even worse oversized "my wang is tiny and I'm compensating" dually that never sees the dirt hunks of garbage. But then don't let me belittle the size of your unit, we all need something to spend money on, right?

If you are looking for a stylish and very very agreeable truck that has all the amenities you could want and can still haul anything you REALISTICALLY need hauled, this is the truck for you.

UPDATE 4/25/02

I have now had this truck for more than six months, long enough to thoroughly evaluate it.  i would like to say that this vehicle is a dream come true.  It is rock solid reliable, nothing on it has either broken or failed, everything on it is just as good as new and it rails when you drive it fast.  I haven't had a moving violation in a car for five years, and I got three tickets in this truck since I bought it.  It's just that much fun to drive.  I have had no problems with it at all, none, zero, zilch, niet.  Because of the color I got (bright yellow), I guess I could say that my only problem is the crud I take from my coworkers about owning the "Baywatch" truck.  Fork them.  When they can afford new cars, they can choose the color they like.  I chose yellow.  That shuts 'em up fast. 

 Anyway, hauling capacity has been tested several times through trips to the dump and many many trips from our storage unit (moving and all), and I can't tell the difference when i have a load and don't other than the angle of the truck front to back.

The paint hasn't chipped much at all lately, but I take good care of my truck with regular washing and waxing.  I have put 14,000 miles on the truck in six months, so I know what I am saying when I say that this truck is reliable.  I have driven to the top of the Sierras repeatedly (to go snowboarding) in all kinds of weather with no problems at all.  I have done this that and the other thing, gone on road trips, commuted in the city (san francisco), done everything except off road work, and this truck has done it all without complaint, hesitation or problem.  I love my truck.  I see people in their huge Chevy's or Toyotas and just chuckle.  I know what the real deal is, I got everything they did and had enough left to buy a new stereo system (which I did, expect the review on that soon).  If you are looking for a great price on a great truck and don't need to do any off roading or hard core hauling/loading, you just can't beat this deal.
