            So what took so long? The 1999 Chevrolet Corvette hardtop is the first 'Vette with a fixed roof since the classic 1963-67 Corvette Stingray. Since then, Corvettes have had a roof with removable panels or a convertible top. The hardtop joins the Corvette convertible and coupe, which has a removable roof panel. This intensely focused new model is slightly less expensive, a little lighter and a bit more structurally rigid than other Corvettes. The hardtop is aimed mostly at car buffs who love to drive. That's why only a six-speed manual transmission and competition-style suspension are offered. A subtle silhouette distinction sets the hardtop apart from the coupe, and it can be argued that it is the best-looking 'Vette. Mostly, the hardtop is a welcome addition to the Corvette line. While not the no-frills, entry-level Corvette sorely needed, it's at least a step in the right direction and the most fun-to-drive 'Vette model. That's saying a lot.
