            I purchased this car because it was small and a 4-wheel drive vehicle.  It gives me the sportiness of a small, two-seater sports car with the T-top and also the 4-wheel drive for the snow-driving in the winter.  It didn't turn out to be all that good in the snow because it is so light weight.  I drove a Jeep Wrangler 4x4 before getting this car and I have to put the X-90 into 4 wheel drive more often than I did with the Jeep.  
Although it is a 2-seater, I have lots of storage space.  The trunk is quite large for such a small car.  
This is a great car for someone who doesn't have kids and doesn't need to chaufer around your family.  It does make it necessary for someone else to drive when more than two of us go out to lunch together at work.<br><br>
