            PRE-PURCHASE:
I compared the Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra, Honda Civic, Kia Spectra and of course the Ion.  Mostly what I was after was the most power for the smallest price tag.   Anything else was just icing on the cake.  The Ion has the largest engine and most horsepower of the previously mentioned cars I compared, and also happen to have the lowest price tag after the Financing Incentives in place at the time of purchase.

BUYING EXPERIENCE:
I went on the Internet where you can view a Dealer's inventory and picked out my first three choices in Ion-2 vehicles.  Basically I was after AC, CD player and Alloy Wheels.  Of course when I get to the dealer and give my list to my saleslady they come back with the first two choices have had dealer installed options to them and are considerably more than the web site stated.   The third choice was already sold.  I went with the Ion-2 trim over the Ion-1 because of the incentives on the Ion-2 gave it a little more bang for the buck.  The worse part of the buying experience was in all, I spent over 6-1/2 hours at the Dealership before I got out the door with the car I wanted.

CAR:
The Ion has the largest engine in its class in a 2.2L Ecotech Inline 4 cylinder.  Of the cars I test drove, it most felt like I was driving a car with a 6 cylinder. It has both front and rear anti-sway bars which is evident from the lack of roll in the corners.  The car stays comfortably flat even while cornering at good rate of speed.  The Ion has electric variable assist electric power steering. There is no power steering fluid to ever change, a definate plus when you keep a vehicle as long as I do.

So far the only thing I would call a defect is the first three days I had the car it rained nonstop and the window leaked a drop about ever couple minutes.  So, I scheduled a service appointment just before the New Owner's workshop for them to take a look at the weather trim.   I'm almost afraid to have them do anything for fear they will just screw it up worse in the long run.  A few days later was caught in the rain again, and no leak, so cancelled my service appointment to attempt to fix it.

So far, after several tanks of gas, getting about 32 to 33 miles per gallon.  That is a fair amount of city driving.  Curious to see what I get on a mostly highway trip.

My teenage kids tend to complain about not much room in back seat.  But, it is mostly a commuter car for me to work, so I am usually alone.

I didn't think much of the MP3 player but it turns out, I was able to go from about 30 store bought CDs, down to only two CDs after ripping them to MP3 format.  Who needs a CD disk changer when you can fit 16 CDs onto a single CD?!?!?!

The only negative and it is barely noticable is sometimes at highway speed the front end tends to float a little, it almost feels like you are hydro-planing on a dry road.  It might just be the electric steering has a different feel to it, than traditional power steering and I'm just not used to it yet.

FINANCING:
The financing turned out to be a pretty good deal saving about $4,125 total:
* $1500 Cash Back towards down payment.
* Zero Percent Interest Rate for 60 months(This saved about $1500 in Interest over the life of the loan compared to a regular bank loan at 3.9 percent)
* 90 Days before first payment. (This is usually a bad idea because you still start accruing interest at least 30 days before the first payment.  But, at 0.00% that accrued interest is still $0.00)
* My trade was valued at only $375 less then what I paid for my 2004 Ion, so I only had to pay sales tax on that difference.  Had I bought a used car for the same price it would have cost me $1,125 more in sales tax.
