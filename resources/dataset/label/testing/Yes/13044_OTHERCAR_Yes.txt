            When I was out car shopping last year, I knew I wanted a Grand Prix because I love it's styling.  I was 18 and didn't have a lot of money, so I went for one of the older ones.  I only liked the coupes though, and only with the ground effects.  I bought mine, a "bright aqua" (teal) SE with the 3.4L V-6 and just about every option there is, for $6000.  It was a good price considering it was 8 years old and only had 82,000 miles on it.

I've had a few problems with the car, but I did get a warranty with it that paid for itself within my first 2 months of owning it.  This is where the expensive upkeep comes in.  My alternator quit on me, and I was going to replace it myself (well, with the help of my dad), but we realized that we could not see it at all.  Not from above, not from below.  So, I limped it to a shop and they told me it'd be $400!  The warranty paid for over half of it, so that was cool.  But it took 2 days just to get an alternator replaced, because it's shoved way up in the engine compartment, and the mechanic had to take an axle, exhaust, and all this other stuff off just to see it.

Besides that I haven't had a lot of trouble (yes, the brakes are poorly designed, I've been told there's a class action lawsuit or something but I haven't been able to do anything about it, but they've only been replaced once), and it drives and accelerates great.

It's a LOT of fun to drive.  This thing will get up and go in a snap, and can cruise at 90 mph at only 3000 rpm.  It's quiet on the inside, but I rarely know because I keep the windows and moonroof open all the time.  Gas mileage is a little on the low side, but that might have something to do with the way I drive.  

It will hold four people pretty comfortably, but the headroom in the back is only adequate for those 5'5" and under.  I've had 5 people in it once, but that'll probably never happen again.  The middle seat back there is murder, or so I've heard.

Just take care of it, and it'll get you where you want to go fast, and with style.
