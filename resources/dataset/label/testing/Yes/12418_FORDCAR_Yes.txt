            I have owned my Taurus for about 3 years now and it has been through the ringer several times. As reliable as the engine is the other components that comprise the front end are not. I have had the opportunity to put it in the shop many times to get it repaired. The total money that was spent so far in all almost equals what I paid for it (repairs 2200 and price of car 2400). 

The parts that broke down over a 2 year period are listed as follows. The cv joints were the first to go. The drivers side then the passengers side. Next in the line up was the tire rod ends that literally broke apart, good thing I wasn't going fast or I would have had a terrible wreck. This also caused the rack and pinion to be stressed in a manner that tore the seals and it had to be replaced. Not finished yet. Both rotors had to be replaced due to the bearing going bad and locking up. When the one on the passengers side locked up it also sheared the drive shaft and it had to be replace. How's that for luck? 

Finally to bring this never ending saga to a close the front end started making a clicking sound and I thought what now! Next shortly after getting the rotor and drive shaft fixed the transmission went out. It is currently sitting under an oak tree in my yard awaiting a transplant. I really hate to get rid of it because I have invested so much into the front end components. Also the engine still runs in A-1 condition even after all the other problem , still starting on a dime.<br><br>
