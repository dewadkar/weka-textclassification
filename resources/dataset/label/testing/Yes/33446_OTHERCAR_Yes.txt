            I recently purchased a new VW Jetta GLS 2000 with automatic and a 6-CD changer.

To this point, I have no complaints about the car.  The car handles like most Germam autos (great stearing, breaking, etc.) and the styling is great.  I was previously driving a '94 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  So far, I have had no problems with snow or any other situation where a 4x4 would be preferred.  Also, the car gets about 27 mile/gallon (a vast improvement over the jeep).

This car is great for anyone who wants a sporty, but safe car.  I paid with cash in hand and the best I could do was $18,100.  You can expect to get better deals based on the color you choose (no reductions for a silver).  

If I had one complaint, I would like a slightly better stereo system to go with the 6-cd changer, otherwise, VW has been great throughout the process.
