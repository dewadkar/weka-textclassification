            I am not a camera professional but enjoy photography. I was interested in a digital camera that took clear, crisp pictures and was easy to use. I tried two other cameras that were similarly priced before trying this one and falling in love with it.

The Fugi 2650 has only 2.0 mega pixels. I was originally under the impression that the higher the pixels the better quality of pictures. After purchasing a 3.2 mega pixel camera that resulted in blurry pictures I learned that the lens makes a lot of difference. When I bought this one I figured that since FUJI was in the business of making Film and higher end cameras that this camera would be of a quality they would be proud to put their name on. I bought this at a large retail chain but have seen it advertised at camera stores. 

The camera is so simple to use. I didn't even read the directions before using it. It was that easy to figure out. I like the fact that there are not very many buttons. To advance the menu options you can press one button up or down or arrows to the right or to the left. It is so easy that my 6 yr old daughter uses it successfully as well. 

The flash on it is very bright. When taking pictures in a darkened room or outside the flash works great and results in beautiful pictures. It has an attached lens cover to protect it when being stored. It does not come with a camera bag, which I think would be useful to protect the LCD screen (where you view the pictures). I have priced camera bags to fit this small camera and they run from 5.99-39.99 at retail camera franchise stores. I purchased rechargeable batteries. It takes 2 AA batteries. I have used 2AA batteries up by taking 36 pictures and uploading them in to the computer. The rechargeables are a great investment. 

Uploading the pictures is also easy. The camera comes with a USB cable that you plug into your computer. You pluf the USB into the side of the camera, click My Computer, click where you see the camera (drive F for example) and then it pulls the pictures off immediately. 36 pictures uploaded immediately. I simply right click and rename them (they come numbered in order that you took them) and I am finished. I go back to the camera and hit Menu. I scroll to the page to delete pictures. The camera asks if you would like to delete just one frame or all frames. If I select all frames it takes less than 3 seconds to delete all pictures. 

The only negative aspect that I have is that if you are taking quick , consecutive shots it takes a few seconds to reload. I would rarely have a need to take quick, consecutive shots like that so this camera fits my needs very well. 

I have printed several pictures taken with my camera onto photographic paper and framed them. The pictures look wonderfully crisp and clear.
