            After test-driving every VW the dealer had on the lot, I have to say that the Golf is my absolute favorite!  With the new power behind the Golf, and the comfort inside this car is perfect for any length of trip.  

This is not the old school VW golf.  Compared to my old 88 model, this one feels a lot safer, and much more sturdy.  I have driven many VW's through out the years and the 99-2000 models are the best yet.

The old VWs were so light they could blow right off the road.  These are made with a more dependable and durable steel.  

Inside of the car there is a 6 speaker surround sound stereo system.  The chairs offer great back support which is adjustable.  Tilt stearing that can be easy on the neck and shoulders, and indigo blue lighting which is easy on the eyes.

In the trunk, there is a wonderful amount of space for all of your needs, and a &quot;secret&quot; compartment that stores your 6 disk cd player, or your first-aide kit.  

This car is sporty for the college student, dependable for those with saftey in mind, and even makes a great family car!  This is an all around everything you could want and more type of car...buy it!<br><br>
