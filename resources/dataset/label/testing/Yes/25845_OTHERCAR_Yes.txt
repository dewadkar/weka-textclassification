            Since 1984, I've owned 4 Jeep Cherokees.  I had the original 1984, a 1985, a 1987, and a 1988.  When I got my first Cherokee, I was really a &quot;unique&quot; driver.  I would get stopped in parking lots and asked &quot;what is that?&quot;, even though the letters &quot;J E E P&quot; were clearly written on the hatch!!  Since the first day I slid behind the wheel of my first Jeep, I knew I'd never drive another car unless I absolutely HAD to.  In the beginning, my older ones (the 84 and 85) were &quot;slow&quot;, but there were more &quot;positive&quot; features than negative.  I've only ever owned manual transmissions, so I can't speak for any of the automatics (I've always believed that automatics were for sissys anyway) but I've been through 31 inches of snow, and four feet of water with my trucks, and NEVER have I been stuck.  

Of course, as with any four wheel drive, the &quot;center of gravity&quot; is higher, and precautions have to be taken when maneuvering this vehicle.  It is NOT a Ferrari, and shouldn't be driven like one.  It actually makes me angry when I read about the &quot;unsafe&quot; features of this truck concerning the fact that people &quot;flip them over&quot;.  This is a sport utility vehicle, not a race car ... of course it won't take turns like a low center of gravity sports car, it wasn't designed to.  I have yet to see someone in a Ferrari or a Corvette try to maneuver 31 inches of snow or 4 feet of water in either vehicle, then blame the VEHICLE for being unsafe.  Yet, I've seen over and over again, people &quot;blame&quot; the Jeep for trying to do things with it that is totally against the design.   I don't believe this IS a design flaw ... I believe that people buy these vehicles with NO skills and expect the vehicle to compensate for their ignorance. 

Now, back to the Jeep itself.  First, it is a VERY comfortable vehicle to drive.  Because I have serious back problems, I have run into problems with other vehicles, depending upon how long I've had to sit in them.  I don't have these problems with my Jeep.  I've also used it on many occasions to tow a 26 foot camping trailer, and a 30 foot enclosed car trailer.  It can do both.  I could have used a bit more power at times, but it NEVER failed me in anyway.  The one feature I've never seen advertised in ANY commercial is the rear hatch.  It &quot;doubles&quot; as an awning in rain or snow when I'm shopping.  Now to me??  That's worth alot.  Unlike a lot of other 4 wheel drive or station wagons, the Cherokee's hatch is one piece and opens from the bottom.  It's not split in the middle.  That may not seem too big a deal to someone who's over 6 foot tall, but to me (I'm still trying to reach 5'4&quot;), it is a big deal.  I can easily put packages in or take them out, and I'm &quot;protected&quot; from the elements of nature every time.  

Ok ... now for the best part ... as you can see, it &quot;appears&quot; that I stopped buying Jeeps in 1988.  Well, I stopped buying them because I was in a serious accident (not vehicle related) and my income is not what it used to be.  So I have a Jeep Cherokee, with almost 200,000 miles on it and still going strong.  I still don't HAVE to replace my Jeep, nor do I want to replace my Jeep.  Other than usual maintenance, I've never had a serious problem with it.  It still has the same engine, transmission, transfer case, and rear differential that it came with.  I didn't &quot;baby&quot; this truck, it's been a &quot;work horse&quot; from day one.  I've only ever replaced the clutch once, and I replaced it because I had 150,000 miles on it ... the mechanic who replaced it told me I could have gotten another 50,000 easy on the clutch he replaced.  I always have replaced the oil in the truck every 3,000 miles, but I've done that with all my other vehicles also.

So, if you're looking for a dependable vehicle, my money will ALWAYS be on a JEEP Cherokee.  <br><br>
