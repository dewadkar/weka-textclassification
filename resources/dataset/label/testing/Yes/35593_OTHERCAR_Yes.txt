            Ok, I have an aging Geo Metro, 94  2 door. Nice car for reliability but no airbags and with the traffic around Seattle being dangerous at best, I decided I needed something a bit more substantial to commute in. I commute 45 miles one-way so gas mileage was a real consideration for me. At first I had been sold on a Nissan Sentra...nice car don't get me wrong. But after careful consideration of what exactly I would be using my next vehicle for, (sledding trips to Mt Rainier, frolicking on the sandy beaches etc..) I decided I needed something a bit more utilitarian. Alas, the Chevy Tracker seemed to fit the bill. 

Now I had done fairly extensive research so I knew exactly the options, engine, transmission ...etc..that I wanted, so when I went to the dealers to test drive I wasn't wasting time with vehicles that wouldn't work. I drove both the Tracker and its cousin the Suzuki Grand Vitara. All in all, the Grand Vitara had a few more options but also had the V6 engine. Due to my gas mileage needs, the 4 mpg difference between the I4 and V6 was more important than the power difference. I had also looked into comparable vehicles to the Tracker like Rav 4 and CRV. Not only were they much more expensive, they didn't ride any better, didn't have low 4wd gear and the CRV was all-wheel, not 4wd. Both the competitors are also based on a car rather than a truck platform. Now that is fine if you are just kicking around town and such. But for serious 4-wheeling, the Tracker is a much better choice. (plus it is about $5K cheaper)

I decided to try CarsDirect.com to purchase the vehicle. I am glad to say that it worked great. Not only did I get a good deal, but I also saved the hassles of dealing with pushy salesmen(women) and yes, they do still lurk on the car lots...

I have had my 2001 Tracker for 3 days now, have driven it approximately 100 miles, and am so glad I made the decision to buy it instead of a passenger car. The Tracker rides a bit more like a truck than a car but still very smooth. Power is more than adequate with the 5-speed manual transmission. Seats are so much more comfortable than in my Metro that it is like night and day difference. My Tracker is well-equipped with A/C, cruise, power windows/locks, power steering, 4WD, power mirrors, CD, rear defog and wiper. I tested everything (including the A/C in December..brrr..) and all seems to work as it should. The real kicker to this whole thing is that the Sentra I was looking to buy came in at a bit over $16K. My Tracker with more room, fully equipped, 4x4 SUV was $16,733 with the $2000 rebate Chevy is offering through 1/2/01. I will continue to update this opinion with any pros or cons that I happen to experience to help others pondering new vehicle purchases. 

UPDATE: 2/5/01-I have now driven my Tracker over 4k and have had no significant troubles. The only real complaint I have is the speakers in the back tend to rattle a bit if I have the music up too much....other than that, I am more than pleased that I bought the Tracker and highly recommend it to anyone else pondering a compact SUV. I drove it from Seattle to north of Spokane WA (approx 325 miles) fully loaded with 4 adult size people(kids are getting big!). Never had a problem driving in snow/ice on Snoqualmie pass or up my dad's steep icy driveway. Also driving back up Vantage hill on I-90 ( 10 miles of uphill grade) was able to maintain 75 mph in 5th gear. One last surprise is I am getting at least 28 mpg which is 3 mpg more than epa estimates. 

UPDATE: 7/12/01-Still very pleased with my Tracker. Did notice a tendency to get pushed around in strong winds on the freeway. Gas mileage has been excellent, much better than expected. Only one minor problem, light to indicate cruise control is on stopped working. Also wishing there was a manual shut-off for the DRL's(daytime running lights) and also a bypass for the automatic headlights. I just like to be in control of the lights. Plastic inside tends to get scratched rather easily. Have 16K miles and still virtually no troubles. Air conditioner got a workout going to Idaho last weekend. Temps were in the upper 90's. Worked like a champ and mileage was only minimally affected. Averaged 23 MPG with A/C on. Will continue to update when warranted.
