            Well after having read some bad reviews of this car I decided I would write about it myself since I own one. Yep that�s right underline that fact, I will be talking from experience, not about the commercials because I like to see my rants in print. The basic facts for you my wife and I have a two-door, manual 4 speed with overdrive that was purchased last year, start of July 2000, this car replaced a 92 Honda Civic 4-door. We now have 17,000 miles on the car. A lot of the miles are highway miles, some long road trips, we live in a somewhat smaller town 45,000 people and so we don�t do much large city driving. Also for those interested in those sort of things we haven�t had any TV in our house, other than movies, for a year, so I will not be reviewing commercials or Toyota�s advertising campaign about it, because I haven�t seen it, those disappointed by this please go get a tissue. We bought it based on price and style, my wife is used to driving smaller cars like this and they work out quiet nicely. The bottom line we paid about 9600 all told for this car. Now on to the meat of the review. We are very happy with this car. Know what to expect, become rooted in reality. This car is roomy in the inside 4 adults can ride in this no problem with a modest to high degree of comfort depending on your situation. I have really long legs and am genuinely uncomfortable in most all cars that I ride in, especially the back. Driving the Echo I can stretch out fairly well, it�s not my idea of perfection, but I can deal with it. The times I have ridden in the back seat I thought it was a little tight on legroom, but I experience the same tight legroom in most of the smaller 4-door cars as well. So all told the backseat is tight but manageable if you have long legs, everyone else that has ridden in the backseat with us that have shorter legs than I do seemed genuinely impressed by the amount of room so there you go. The backseat also has handy drink holders on each side on an armrest that is sort of recessed into the sidewalls. The front seats have three-drink holder, two glove compartments, two side storage holes on each side of the radio, and one storage place under the driver�s dash. All told this car has more storage areas in the car than most any other car has. Driving the car I would have to say is very enjoyable. You have probably seen or heard about the gauges (fuel, tach, speedometer, oil, temp, etc) being located in an oval that is in the center of the dash. This happens to be my favorite part about the car and driving it, the gauges are not hidden behind the steering wheel they are out in the open and easy to view. The car handles very well and is easy to steer and control. This car is a small car so on the highway during winds you can feel it, but that is to expect in all small cars. No problems with driving this car. The high selling point of the car may be the excellent fuel economy, we get about 40 when it�s all said and done, and that is a huge benefit when everyone I know is complaining about the high cost of gas. The heating and cooling system works great, no problems there. The trunk has a good amount of storage space as well. All told the functional parts and performance of this car is very good for it�s price range, and I am very happy with the purchase (I like it a lot more than the Honda Civic we had before this). Now I guess that only leaves what the car looks like in question, which I guess is a matter of personal opinion, and the looks are what people seem to talk about the most. But when it�s your car and you drive it everyday most of your time is spent looking at the inside and all the other idiot you pass have to look at the exterior and who cares what they think anyway? Back to the looks, I like the way the car looks, true it�s kind of tall but that equals head room, it looks about like the typical little car that out there but a little different. Looks are about opinion, and if you are so inclined to buy a car for the looks go right ahead, more power to you, but I purchased this car for all of the above reasons not just looks. So decide for yourself on appearance and factor all the other elements as well. One other thing to leave you with consider the price range of car you are looking at, and not just the car price add in gas over the life of the car fuel aint cheap and I got news for you it aint getting any cheaper ever again, and then decide the best deal. The Echo isn�t my dream sports car, or really fancy, but I didn�t expect it to be what I expect was a 9600 dollar car that was efficient, drove well, looked good and did what I needed it to do. I got all that and then some.
