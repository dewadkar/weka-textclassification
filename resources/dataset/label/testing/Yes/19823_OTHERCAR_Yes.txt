            Upon the demise of my 1991 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer, I decided to start shopping for a new sport ut, beginning with another Ford, moving to Toyota.  I first drove the 4Runner and found it to be smaller and less powerful than the Explorer, but handled much better.  I was convinced at a dealership to test drive a 1997 LandCruiser, selling for about the same price as a new 4Runner and decided to buy it.  

First off, I cannot say how much better the handling is on it, compared to the Ford Explorer.  It is tighter on rough road, takes corners without making my passengers car sick and sticks to the road amazingly well for its size and height.  Braking is also much better than the Explorer and turning radius is only slightly wider.  Although the turning radius is usually wider on a 4 wheel drive vehicle, this one WAY outperforms such vehicles as Blazer/Jimmy/Bravada.  So far, gas mileage has been consistent at 15, only 2 mpg less than the lighter and smaller Explorer.  I am satisfied with that, even when dinging my credit card for $28-30 a tank.  The quiet, smooth ride makes it all worthwhile!  

My only complaint?  How about a drycleaning hook and useable cupholders?  OH - they've figured those out in the newer models.  WAY TO GO TOYOTA!!<br><br>
