            As a 1999 Ford Taurus owner, I recently had to rent a 2000 Ford Focus over the Christmas holidays.  The challenge for me is trying to throw off my anti-compact bias when composing this epinion...

<b>Roominess</b>

The Ford Focus isn't as compact as some compacts- it even has more headroom than many &quot;larger&quot; cars like the Ford Contour.  I'm 6'6&quot; and a bit overweight, yet I still fit in this car better than most other cars in its class.  In fact, I fit in this car better than I do in a Toyota Camry. My head had an inch or two to spare from the ceiling of the vehicle.  Leg room is also decent for a compact car.  I was not comfortable nor was I in pain while trying to drive/ride in this car.  This is more than I can say for most compact cars.  The seats themselves were quite comfortable.  

Now, I did not even try to get in the back seat :)  But, my mother-in-law did.  She's about 5'1&quot;, average weight.  She had plenty of room.  The back seats are roomy enough for children or young teenagers, though they probably would not hold 2 adults very comfortably.  3 adults in the back seat is totally out of the question, but that's fairly common with a compact car.  Headroom is more than adequate for the back seat area.  

The trunk of the car is fairly roomy.  The Ford Focus has a high rear end, and this allows for more trunk space.  In fact, there was more trunk space available than I expected.

<b>Driving the Focus</b>

You don't need earplugs, but the engine sounds a little more like a forklift than it does a purring kitten.  While your ears do adapt, it became obvious to me very quickly than this was a louder ride than my Taurus at home.  This 4 cylinder engine does not have a lot of pickup, either.  If you ever get in an evasive driving situation, it may be difficult to steer the Focus away from danger because the acceleration is quite slow.  The Focus does well on turns, though- control stays fairly smooth.  Ford claims the vehicle will get about 27 MPG/city and 35 MPG/highway. We had similar results with our gas mileage, which is a nice plus for the Focus.  

One fairly large obstacle came up while my wife was driving the Focus.  She's 5'5&quot; (about average height for a woman), and could not see over or around the headrest to check her blind spot.  The headrests in this car are larger than you'll find in most, but this feature made driving a bit more dangerous than it should have been.  If you are about this height, you may have to rely totally on your mirrors for viewing side and rear traffic.

I did not like the noisy features of this car, either.  The power locks are noisy, and the turn signal sounds like a ticking time bomb.  I suppose should you purchase this car, they will grow on you after several weeks, though.  

The heater on this car takes several minutes to start working.  Unlike most modern cars (like my Taurus) that can crank serious heat in just a few seconds, the Focus took about 4 or 5 minutes of driving to even get the heat to start coming on.  Once it works, it works very well, but the delay was a bit annoying. 

<b>Conclusion</b>

Among compact cars, the Focus is near the head of its class.  The roominess inside is almost enough to bump this car out of the compact car designation.  I strongly recommend the Focus if these things describe your situation:
-family with young children (1 or 2 children)
-limited budget
-you are not a large person yourself
-single college student
-you like the European styling (some people don't)


If I was looking into buying a compact car, I would strongly consider buying a Ford Focus.  However, after being spoiled by my Taurus at home, I think I'm ready to have a couple more horses under the hood.
