            In 1990, I bought a  brand NEW 1991 Toyota Camry DX edition.  Camry was then emerging as one of the top selling cars in the US, and I decided not to buck the growing trend.  Now almost 10 years, and 80,000 miles later, I still have no regrets on purchasing this vehicle.  It has never been in an accident, and barely needs any service.  Its a true gem, and an amazing family vehicle.  

My Camry has been through it all.  Rain, sleet, snow, hail, and yet still it does not even have 1 dent or ding!  I find it amazing and hard to believe, but yet a blessing as well.  This car is a true survivor.  The car has no body wear or rust.  My exterior is so mint, every time I pass by my local Toyota dealer to get a part, he makes me an offer on my car.  I've resisted each temptation.

I have the original stock Toyota 14&quot; rims with Toyota wheels covers that were sold on the car in 1990, as the 91 model, and they are still in excellent shape.  Additions I've made to the exterior include new tail lamps, and upgraded door locks, since my alarm does not function.  I never bothered to get it fixed, because the steel door locks do the trick.

The interior is rough and rugged through and through.  I have 2 teenagers that occupy the back seat a lot, and the seats back there are still as firm as the day I bought the car. Up front, the material on the headrests is becoming ripped a bit.  The steering wheel, the panels, the glove box and the dash are all intact and original.

I made a stereo upgrade recently to a Power Acoustic 180 system, and purchased 4 new speakers.  The kids think I'm a lot cooler now when I pump my favorite pop song.

Overall, this car is a keeper for life,  I'd never abandon this car, unless I had to junk it due to an engine failure, but otherwise, its great!  The car makes an excellent used car, and family sedan, and anyone in the market for a car that will now cost them under $6,000, should seriously consider this car.
