            The Celica is making a return for the 2000 model year.  The Celica is has a very aggressive profile.  The &quot;cockpit&quot; of this car grips the driver well and all the controls/instruments are directed towards the driver providing easy grasp for the driver.  Also, the interior of the Celica is much better than that of the Integra which lacks the quality of workmanship that Toyota has always carried.  
The engine of the Celica is a ripping 180 horsepower DOHC four cylinder.  Also, if you think the Integra is better because of the &quot;VTEC&quot;, WAKEUP.  Toyota's VVTL-I engine is much better than VTEC which is basically now history.  The only difference is that Toyota doesn't sit there and make any stickers that say VVTL-I and stuff.  Overall a good car and excellent buy.<br><br>
