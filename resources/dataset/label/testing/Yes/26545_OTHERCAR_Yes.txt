            The 2000 Chevy S10 Xtreme is a factory sport truck made by Tecstar in Shreveport, La across from the GM plant that builds the S10 and Sonoma. It comes with GM's ZQ8 sport suspension package that lowers the truck 2&quot;, and has a diffrent steering box. The Xtreme is just a appearance package that includes a ground effects and a aggressive airdam. All the regular options that are available on the regular S10 are available on the Xtreme. The Xtreme is also only available in 4 colors, victory red, summit white, onyx black, and new for 2000 indigo blue. The model Xtreme that I drove was a white regular cab sportside Xtreme with a 4.3 V6 and 4 speed automatic transmission, it was also fully loaded with power windows, locks, 60/40 split bench (which I don't recommend, buy the bucket seats), cd player, cruise, tilt wheel. There's only a few things about this truck that I don't like, one of them is the 4.3 V6, it just doesn't seem to have the punchy feeling of the 89' S10 Cameo that I drove some years back, although in 1989 the 4.3 only put out 165 hp, now it puts 180 hp in 2wd form. The other thing is I wouldn't pay $1,070 for the 4 speed automatic, but that's my opinion, some people don't like manual transmissions. The lowered suspension doesn't hurt the ride quality as one might think. In fact it rides quite nice. It's got 16&quot; wheels and tires. It's also available with either the 4.3 V6 or the 2.2 4 cylinder.  If your looking for a sport truck but don't want to build one, look no further.        <br><br>
