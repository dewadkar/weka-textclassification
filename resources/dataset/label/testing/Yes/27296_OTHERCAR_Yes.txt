            I would like to start off and say that we bought our Dodge Durango about a year ago and we have  30,000 miles on it.  I have been nothing but pleased with it!

INTERIOR

The interior is really nice in the Durango!  I really like how it can seat seven people safely.  All the seats in the back can fold down to give you a lot of cargo space in the rear.  Some people say that the dashboard looks like it is with to much plastic but I dont agree.  The gauges are really easy to read and very clear day and night.  The seats are super comfortable even in the last row.  You have more headroom than you would ever imagine in the very back seat.  

EXTERIOR

The looks of the Durango are fantastic.  We own the 2wd model.  The Durango is almost the perfect size.  It is not so huge that you cant ever park it straight but it is not too small.  

ENGINE

This Durango came equipped with the 5.2 liter &quot;318&quot; engine.  This engine run very smoothly with great throttle responce.  On the down side the engine really does like gas and you average about 14 mpg.  

OVERALL DRIVING EXPERIENCE

Overall I really am satisfied with my Durango.  If I had it to do all over agian I would not change my decision.  The Durango is VERY smooth riding.  It is really a joy to ride in.  You can get in trouble really easily because it is easy to be doing 80 mph and it only feel like 60.  I have had mine to about 117 before and it was still going and it was so smooth at that speed!!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO GO ABOVE POSTED SPEED 
LIMIT AT ALL!!! IT IS VERY UNSAFE!!!  The braking is really good for a SUV.<br><br>
