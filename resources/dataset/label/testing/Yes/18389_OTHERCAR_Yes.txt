            We bought this vehicle from my inlaws--who sprang it on us last summer.  It's turned out to be a very good car--for the most part.  I have recently learned that it had severe transmission problems(to the tune of 1800 in repairs).  However that is the only problem we've had with it at all.  Our particular model I love because it's so huge.  I can just toss stuff haphazardly in the trunk, and still fit 3 kids in the back seat.  This is a great family car--it's incredibly comfortable, and, as long as you don't mind people thinking it's a rich old person car--or a pimp car I think it would be a great purchase.  Another bonus, it goes up those 14,000+ mountain roads as well, or even better, than some SUV's I've seen.
