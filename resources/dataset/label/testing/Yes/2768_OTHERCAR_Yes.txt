            For 6 long years I drove Acura (clear my throat....Honda) autos, never knowing that a car was not supposed to have so much understeer that it made turning into a parking lot an adventure.  Don't get me wrong, the car never broke or left me stranded, but I wish it had so I would have dumped them earlier.  By chance I test drove a 97 Jetta GLX while shopping for an Acura and it showed me the light, but I was talked out of it in favor of the more reliable Acura.  Those people are no longer my friends, sorry it had to be this way dad.   4 years later after I had all the fun sucked out of driving I was saved by a classified ad.  1997 Jetta GLX, 5 speed, fully loaded w/ every option, low miles and priced to sell.  I thought there would be a catch but the car checked out fine and was in mint condition.  How many 4 year old Hondas do you see not missing a piece of a bumper?
Within 2 days i was hooked on the car, corners like on rails, power/torque on command when on the highway or any road for that matter and brakes faster than George Bush passing a cocoa field.  After 9 months of trouble free fun driving I could not be happier.  Whatever you like about the car you own now, the Jetta will be better.  It is that feeling that will never allow myself to purchase anything but a VW product.
