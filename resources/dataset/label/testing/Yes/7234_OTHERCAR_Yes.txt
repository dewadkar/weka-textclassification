            While I was car shopping, I came across a very intresting car, a 1999 Mercury Cougar.

Exterior

At first glance I knew this wasn't an ordinary car. The styling (Ford's 'New Edge' styling) was kind of odd but it kind of grows on you after a while. The front looks like a cat with a smirk on its face, which I guess the people at Ford were going for. The sides are simplistic, and flare out a bit on the bottom. The rear is my absolute favorite part of this car. It's rounded, had cool cat-like tail-lights (Important is it's going to be called a Cougar) and somehow they blended an angular rear spoiler onto it. It all seems to blend flawlessly. However I would say they seemed to rip off the overall shape of the eagle talon, but hey... who's asking. All together, you'll either love or hate the looks of the car.

Interior

The Interior was the best part of the car. With most sports coupe, you feel as though your sitting on the ground or in case of the Acura Integra, laying on it. This car feels better mostly because your in a nice, comfortable postition. Although this postion in a sports coupe really comprimises headroom. The seats are very comfortable and offer tons of support. Some say too much support, but I like it. The controls are laid out very well and it's all in perfect access of your busy hands. The console seems to blend together (like the exterior). It is all bordered with an aluminum finish which looks very sleek. Most people will say it's plain and thoughtless, but my response to that is why would you want that faux plastic wood in your car? It's just really tacky. I like the fact that there's an "easy-in" feature, which enables passangers to easily enter and exit the rear seats (which are both buckets as well). This car needs cup holders though, one in the front just doesn't cut it with me.

Performance

Although it's got a peppy 170 hp v6 engine, it seems to accelerate rather slow. It just needs more torque. It shifts smoothly and the ride is very sedan-like, although it handles extremely well. 

Overall I thought the car was good. However things like interior room became an issue for me. I guess this is why it has been labled a girls car. Anyone above 5'10 would be very uncomfortable. Otherwise it's a good city car, not really a sports car.
