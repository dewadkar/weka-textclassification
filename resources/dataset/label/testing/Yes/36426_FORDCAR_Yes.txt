            I love this car!!  I bought it new, ordered from the factory w/ the exact options that I wanted.  I picked it b/c I get the A-plan b/c I have relatives that work at Ford...but I also really liked the looks, comfort, performance, and economy.

For a sports car, it has always gotten great gas mileage.  I have gotten as much as 29 on hwy and I usually average around 24 mpg on regular driving.

Problems

I have had to replace the spark plug wires twice.  At 60,000 and 100,000 miles.  Fortunately, the wires I got the first time had a lifetime warranty so they got replaced for free.  Oh, don't get them from Ford either, get and OEM version from a parts store.  I have read that Ford will charge about $300 for a set of plug wires, while you can buy them for around $50-$100...and they are better.

I had a dust boot split at around 100,000 miles.  It was a pain to replace b/c I did it myself.  You have to take a lot of parts off to get to it.  I also had a dealer replace the water pump (b/c I thought it might be leaking), and my belts since they were in there anyway.

I replaces the valve cover gaskets and throttle body gaskets myself.  Oil was getting into the spark plug chamber and I thought that was causing a miss in the engine.  Wrong, it was a bad plug wire.  I replaced it all anyway.  It was a big job b/c it is so hard to get things apart.  I definitely recommend getting a manual if you want to work on this car.  I can't really recommend the Haynes manual tho.  In just the one job I did, it had a few typos and just plain mistakes.

Performance...

Incredible.  It's a wonderful car.  It accelerates very well and is very sure-footed.  No torque-steer at all.  It is like riding on a roller coaster when you go around a curve...just a lot smoother and easier on the joints.  The 165 hp is very nice for a small car.  Oh...and it handles very well in the snow.  Front wheel drive and antilock makes a good combination.  Just remember to drive like you have some sense.  It is actually hard to handle in the rain.  Wet pavement makes it hard to take off w/o spinning.  You just have to get used to a light car w/ a lot of torque/horsepower.

Comfort...

It is very comfortable to me.  I am 6 foot and fit in it very well.  I actually like it better than most cars I have ridden in.  I just like the feel of the seats I guess.

Cockpit...

The interior is laid out very well.  You can see all the gauges and get to everything very easily.  The center console is ever so slightly angled toward the driver.  That is really good.  I wish they still had the button to make the popup lights stay up permanently.  That is nice if you want to work on them or you want them to stay up so that ice doesn't freeze over them.  You can get a FAQ that tells you how to make it work tho.  I like the fade to off interior lights.  I also really like the light near the ignition to help you find it after you have shut the door.

Stereo...

I really like the graphic equalizer.  It was an option that was about $100, so I went for it.  It would have cost me that much to get an aftermarket one and it would have never looked as good as this one.  I have read reports of the speakers on the right side getting bad after a while.  Mine has done that too.  I suspect that the culprit is the external amp (located near the right rear speaker).  That would explain why the speakers sound good sometime and it is localized to the right side.  I'd like to verify this by replacing it.  I have already replaced the front speakers and the one in the right door still sounds bad at times.  Overall, nice stereo.  I added a CD changer later b/c the factory one is way too expensive.  A sub was optional, which a friend had that said it was an improvement, but if you REALLY want bass, add you own sub.

Exterior...

I got Electric Blue as my paint.  It is beautiful.  All I have to do is pull into a gas station and it is very common for someone to stop me to mention what a beautiful blue it is...or how it looks purple in some light, etc.  It is really nice.

Tires...

When I got new tires, I went for MasterCraft.  The Goodyears were just too soft.  Unless you need tires that soft, opt for something else, they will last long and 16 inch tires aren't cheap.

Durability...

Great...I have about 110,000 miles on it and I plan to keep it until it croaks.  Even if I sold it, I would have to get something like it.  It is my preferred mode of trasportation...and I have a brand new 2000 F150 Lariat 4x4 SuperCab...but I still want to drive the Probe to work.

Space...

Not much for people in the back seat...ok for kids.  It is a sports car after all.  However, I played in a band for a few years and was always able to haul all my drums (6 piece) in the back.  It has a lot of space back there w/ the seats down...and I usually had room for a front passenger.  It was better than a truck in a lot of cases b/c it was covered.

Recommendations...

Keyless entry is great, but it would be nice to be able to pop the hatch like a lot of cars can open their trunk.  Another suggestion would be to at least put a little light near the keyhole for the trunk.  You can't find it in the dark.  The keyholes on the doors have a little light that lights up in the middle for when the doors have been unlocked...which is kinda pointless at that point.

Overall...

I have heard of problems w/ this car, but most seem to be related to the 4 cylinder.  I really like this car and may have just been lucky w/ it.  It would take a lot for me to sell this car right now.<br><br>
