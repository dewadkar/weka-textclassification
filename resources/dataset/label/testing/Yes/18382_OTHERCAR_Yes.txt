            There ought to be a law that says that automotive engineers must live with their creation for the entire time it's being offered for sale.  If this were followed for the Mercury Villager engineers, you could bet that the middle passengers would have cup holders (the 94 models have none), and that the rear heat controls mounted in the middle row window ledge could be disabled by the driver (they can't - allowing children to alternately freeze or cook the rear seat inhabitants...one of our boys has treated several occupants to multiple freeze/thaw cycles).  


Beyond the funky interior features, the van is underpowered (granted, I'm of the opinion that few cars are adequately powered).  It does make up for it's lethargy with excellent handling.  On-center steering is great, as is braking.  In 40,000 miles of aggressive driving, I've only engaged the ABS twice on dry pavement (ice doesn't count).  Economy has been impressive - 20 mpg in the city, as much as 24.5 mpg on the highway cruising at 70 - 72 mph.  I can't imagine a much better long distance hauler in the minivan category.

Fit and finish is still pretty good on our van, even after 94,000 miles (we bought it used.)  The rear hatch has a VERY handy feature - you can lift the entire hatch or just the rear glass.  This makes it easy to toss a few light items in behind the rear seat without having to feel like you're opening a barn door.  The seats still look good, and all the gadgets still work, with the occasional exception of the cd player, which acts as if it's hunting for a cd for a while before 'catching' and playing.  <br><br>
