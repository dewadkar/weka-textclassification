            Synopsis (1986 model):

A truly idiosyncratic car - practical but inconvenient, well-engineered but underpowered, roomy but smallish.  

Specs:

2.0L 12-valve 4-cyl. Mitsubishi engine; 3-speed automatic; front-wheel drive; power steering/brakes; alloy wheels; 4-speaker radio

Design/Practicality

We bought this way back when new.  My 5', overly-practical mother had enough of her 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser mini land-yacht and was on a search for something more &quot;her size and her type.&quot;  She was essentially looking for a mini-me minivan.  We ended up in a Colt Vista.  

It is a decent size for a family of small people with kids not yet too big.  The third row is a great kid-area and still left a enough room behind it for some bags.  The seats are nice and firm with an almost SUV-like high seating position.  The center dash is awkward, with the stereo way down low almost floor-level.  Everything is scaled much more for smaller people - the buttons, the seats, etc.  Anyone over 5'10&quot; will probably feel cramped.

It holds quite a bit for such a deceptively small car.  With all the seats down (an easy endeavor), it can hold almost as much as a CR-V and more than our current Outback.  The Vista is very much a mini-minivan.

Driveability:

It feels nose-heavy, but is easy to drive around town and park.  It's a bit top heavy, which makes highway driving with crosswinds harder than you would think.  Most importantly, it's underpowered.  With a few people in the Vista, some gear, and the air conditioning on, it has trouble passing and merging.  The lack of a fourth gear cuts fuel economy as well.

Quality/Maintenance:

Truly great.  Nothing ever went wrong in over 160K miles.  The body creaks a little bit in winter and there are probably some joints that could use a good lubrication, but overall it's been solid.  Maintenance costs and requirements have been below average.  The engine is quite durable and doesn't consume oil.  There are no major components that need expensive servicing at 15k/30k/60k mile intervals.

Buying a used one?

It's eccentric in the way older Subarus were eccentric.  If you need the space, but also need the smaller exterior package, it could be a good fit.  The drivetrain has reputation for reliability and easy servicing, the body is not prone to rust, and it's cheap to maintain.  It is durable, roomy, and is VERY comfortable for shorter people.  If you find one in great condition, it could be a keeper.  

But it's an awkward car, there's no doubt about it.<br><br>
