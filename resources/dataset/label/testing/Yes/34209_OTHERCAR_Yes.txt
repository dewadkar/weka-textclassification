            I've had a PhotoPC 3100z for almost a year now, and only now thought to actually send in a review.  Not to mention I haven't contributed to Epinions in such a long time, I'm starting to feel a little guilty...

On with the review though, this camera is very full-featured for its price, from the 3.3 megapixel (which with Epson HyPict interlopation can actually reach 4 megapixels) to the range of controls, custom W/B... 

Although some of the features of the camera seems to be hidden pretty deep inside the menu system.  Such as setting custom W/B, instead of being able to control W/B from within the shot, you must go into the set-up mode and create a custom W/B balance from there, and then go back to shooting mode.

Generally speaking, once you get used to the camera's controls, learning how to use the W/B balance feature, and learning when to use the flash and when not to.. the images that this camera produced are some of the best in the industry when comparing image quality and color accuracy.  Epson certainly lives up to the regards of producing one of the best CCD in the industry (same as the device being used in their scanners).

However, what this camera doesn't have (and most digital camera in this regard) is an usable fully automatic mode for those times when you don't have the chance to fine tune the settings.  Usually the using the camera's full automatic mode produced anywhere between under-exposed to blurred images.  Especially when taking motion shots, the camera's separate shot "settings" (portrait, sport, and macro) doesn't really work as well as it should.

Overall, I still recommend this camera for the prosumers who take a lot of stills, people who take a lot of scenery shots.  However, if your photos aligns more along the line of birthday parties and vacation photos.. this may not be the best camera for you.
