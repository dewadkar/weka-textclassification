            In my opinion the Sony Mavica family of cameras are the best that have came along that the normal person can afford.  I have had a digital camera for the last four or five years and  these cameras, mavica family, have taken the best of these previous generations and combined them into a well rounded package.  No longer do you have to struggle with hooking up cables and loading software on your computer, insert disk, take picture and insert disk into almost any computer and access your photo.  The picture is saved to a 3 1/2 disk and you can store it there or transfer it to a hard drive with only a couple clicks of a button.  And of course with the higher priced members of the mavica family you can also record sound and moving pictures.  The only draw back I have with this camera, also with all other digital cameras, is that in strong sun light the picture in the digital viewfinder is very difficult to see.<br><br>
