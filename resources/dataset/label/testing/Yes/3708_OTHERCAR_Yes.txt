            I Just bought a brand new Chevrolet Silverado 1500 4X4 and I must admit it is a great truck.  I test drove several vehicles and considered features and I must admit that Chevrolet has done a great job with this rig.  Here are some of my reasons:

1.  Ride.  This vehicle is a full size truck and it rides like a car.  It was smoother than Ford or Dodge and that was what I wanted.  I wanted to have a truck that felt like I was driving a sedan.

2.  Cargo space.  Even though I bought a short box the back bed has lots of storage.  The extended cab on this truck is bigger than Ford and Dodge as well.  It has seating for three in the back and even with three adults there was plenty of room.

3.  Engine Power.  With the new Vortec V-8 this little baby has plenty of power.  Going up a hill carrying a heavy load and hauling a trailer is no problem.

4.  Sound system.  It sounds great.  With the Cd player it has phenominal sound.  The 6 speaker system has great base response and it sounds like you are in a music hall.  Great selection on the speaker system by GM.

5.  Spare Tire.  I am so glad that a company finally spent the money for a full size spare!!

There you have 5 good reasons to buy this Truck.  If you are in the market for a new truck then I highly recommend the Chevrolet 1500 Silverado.  At this point in time I can honestly say that I have yet to find anything wrong with it.<br><br>
