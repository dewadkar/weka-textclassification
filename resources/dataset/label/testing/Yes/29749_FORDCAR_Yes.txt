            I bought this vehicle about 3000 miles ago with 66,000 miles on it.  I bought it for hauling stuff (and people), towing, and occasional off-roading.  My daily commute is a '94 Eclipse which does that job perfectly.

So far on the vehicle, the thermostat and the driver's side seat latch both went.  There was a TSB issued about the seat latch (reclining lever) being too weak on '97-'98s, it costs about $150 to fix at a Ford dealership.  It is covered under the 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper, but of course that did not apply to me.  The mechanic at the Ford dealership also said that some Explorers of this vintage need new thermostats about every year, a bummer because you have to disassemble half the cooling system just to replace it.  Other than those 2 things, it hasn't needed any other repairs yet.

The biggest downside to owning a 2 Door Explorer Sport, in my opinion, is the ride quality with the stock suspension.  Your gut will churn with every bump, and really choppy roads may make the weak-stomached person feel ill.  There are few vehicles in my lifetime I have ever ridden in with as bad a ride.  Potholes and pavement cracks translate directly into jarred bones.  I have heard that an aftermarket set of Bilstein or Edelbrock shocks make a world of difference on these vehicles.  I haven't decided to take that leap yet.  I should also note that I have ridden in several 4 Door XL and XLT models and the ride doesn't seem nearly as harsh.  Also, I'm sure the premium wheel package doesn't help, either (mine has those big shiny alloy wheels and sits higher off the ground).

Speaking of premium packages, mine came with the so-called 'premium sound' package.  Couldn't stand it, yanked it within a month.  Replaced it with a Pioneer headunit and 4 Pioneer 6 x 8" speakers (custom fit for Ford/Mazda vehicles), WORLD of difference in sound quality.  Also bypassed the lovely 20 watt factory amp located on the driver's side back in the cargo area.  What a staticky piece of junk.  Rated at less than 1% THD.  Whoa!  Gotta love that Ford sound system quality.  I have to admit that the Ford premium speakers have come a long way in the 5 years or so before '97, but paper drivers and 'whizzer' cones for tweeters just don't cut it anymore in the 21st century.  Just don't expect miraculous sound regardless of what you put in there because the trucklike acoustic environment and position of the enclosures assure you decent sound at best.  After all, it's still a truck.

Gas mileage:  pathetic.  I get an average of about 18MPG.  It is intresting to note, as a sidebar, that if you use a super high quality synthetic oil, like Mobil 1 0W30, you will get 1-2 more MPG after a while.  Try it, it works!

The engine has barely adequate power.  The 4 liter SOHC engine, introduced in '97 as an option, is MUCH better than the pushrod 4 liter V6 which is standard.  Plus, you only lose 1MPG and gain almost as much power as the V8 option!  If you're looking for a used one, look a little harder for one with the SOHC engine.  I didn't, but I'm sure you will be glad you did.  The 5 speed electronic transmission does have a nice "OD off" button which prevents it from downshifting for more power passing or ascending hills.  You will want to use this button when passing, esp. if you have the base engine.  This is a nice touch, but doesn't make up for a general lack of power.

Comfort level is good, and seats have a nice lumbar support built in.  My back still gets pretty sore after only 100 miles or so.  Visibility is very good.

Braking is adequate.  Handling is questionable in heavy rains, it seems to have a tendency to hydroplane when there is a lot of water accumulated in the 'ruts' in the road, leaving you with a sinking feeling about the resulting momentary loss of control.  Parking the 2dr model is pretty easy since it's 10 inches shorter than the 4 door Explorers.  Steering is taut (I wouldn't call it precise) and I would say there is a slight bit of oversteer.  You can take corners faster than you'd think, but it's no sports sedan.

Before you buy one, consider the mileage and the ride quality.  Those are my two biggest beefs with my '97 Sport.  If the mileage doesn't bother you, take the one you're considering buying through some bumpy city terrain.  Then, to have something to compare it to, drive a Santa Fe or CR-V.  After riding in the Explorer Sport, the ride quality of those will seem like a Mercedes.  Then ask yourself:  "Do I really want to travel hundreds of miles with my insides being pulverized like this?"  If the answer is, "I don't really mind", you'd probably really like the Explorer Sport.  Wanna buy mine?
