            I leased my 2003 Envoy XL SLT on 9-24-2002 for $575(includes 7% sales tax) from Cerrone GMC (http://www.cerroneoldsgmc.com) in South Attleboro, MA for my wife. Cerrone GMC  were great!!! From the NO SALESMAN test drive (my wife and I drove it for 2 1/2 hours) to the no haggling price that they gave us ($37566, MSRP $40550) to the finance guy who got us 0% financing to buy (but changed my mind and went with leasing at 3.5% for 48 months based on the $37566 not MSRP $40550 like some dealers suggest). David Lee was the sales person and Mike Carrs was the finance guy. They didn't try any sales tactics with me since I was ready to walk out if they gave me any crap. After dealing with 9 GMBuyPower online dealers, only 2 were sincere, the rest wanted to get me in the dealership before we talked real numbers (aka sales tactic). I told David Lee what I want and he gave it to me (this took less then 15 minutes, none of that "let me talk to the sales manger" or give me a counter offer crap). Then I went to the finance guy, Mike Carr, and he was great. I was a little concerned since I was turned down for "GMAC leasing" at HURD GMC (http://www.hurdcars.com) in Johnston, RI unless I could put $5000 down (sales tactics since I want the car at a certain price and they said my credit was bad).  Mike Carr put in for financing at GMAC with only $1400 down and was approved at 0% that day (HURD said that GMAC said that my credit was bad, 2 weeks later I was approved from Cerrone GMC, Hmmm what am I missing here???). I highly recommend them, the reason I wrote so much about Cerrone GMC is that dealing with a dealer is big part of owning/leasing the vehicle. Back to the Envoy..

This SUV ( extended length tank) is a dream to drive. It has every toy except the rear load level option (I don't carry anything  except for my 3 children and maybe something from Lowes/HomeDepot once in a while). This gives an excellent ride and has the rear DVD system for the kids (it keeps them SO QUIET, its really nice since I belong to NETFLIX). The interior is beautiful, 10 times better then the Chevy Trailblazer (but the Trailblazer doesn't go for $40K) and very quiet. The BOSE stereo is great and can get LOUD. The client control is a little difficult to use unless you are a tech geek like me. I would recommend getting this vehicle if you don't mind the fuel consumption (May its be due to my 3.72 rear end). This SUV is especially nice for you if you like gadgets like each keyless entry remote changes the option in the truck for you like, the seats readjust to your preset, climate control, mirrors, radio presets and volume, DIC options all  change to how you left it. My Wife LOVES this truck dearly and I do too since we each have are own climate control in the front (no more augments over , Its too hot/cold). She had a 1999 Ford Windstar that she disliked since she felt like soccer mom in it. I was kidding about returning the Envoy (to the dealer) to my kids and they all started pleading and crying to keep it. AGAIN, they love the DVD system and we love the peace and quiet it gives us. This will be a joy for trips to the mountains or when we go to NYC. Ordering additional wireless headsets for the DVD system is a pain since they are a new option. I picked 2002 on epinion since 2003 was not an option..
