            This is the first and only review on the '85 T-Bird, so I'll ty to help you out. :)

The '85 Thunderbird comes w/ a V6 4.6L or V8 5.0L. I opted for the V8 simply for the power. The V8 also has a more "sports car" feel. 

This car is VERY fast. It's idles very high, probably around 30 miles per hour without even touching the gas. Also, from a complete stop, the tires will spin til you hit atleast 40 mph, sometimes as high as 60 mph.

The interior is leather. The '85 T-Bird comes standard w/ power windows but not locks. The radio, as much as I hate to say it, is not worth anything! The knobs are very hard to turn, simply turning the volume up requires your complete attention. The speakers are not very strong either. You can hear the radio better on the outside of the car than you can on the inside. 

This car comes w/ standard wheels, and I'll warn ya, finding hubcaps for the car is almost impossible! They either don't fit or don't look right. I suggest just keeping the original wheels clean. Which also is kind of a pain in the butt.

Tires are also a con on the vehicle. Finding the right size is hard, because you want something w/ enough traction but you can't go too big. I suggest a 255/60/15 Goodyear Regatta 2. The ride w/ these tires is very smooth!

Since this car is RWD (rear wheel drive), driving in snow and thunderstorms is a pain! You have to be careful not to stomp on the gas (which is also very easy in this car) because the car will fishtail very easily.

Considering it's a V8 it is also pretty hard on gas. It's not terrible but it only gets about 200 miles per tank, when most cars can easily get 300.

Repairs aren't too bad, getting the oil changed can take a little time because it's pretty hard to find the oil filter. That is the biggest problem I've had w/ mine yet.

All in all, if you are a responsible driver and can fill it up every 3 days, I recommend this car.
