            I got this for this recent Christmas.  (The wife said she got a better deal than she could find on other brands.)  I had been using the digital still option on my video camera.  The quality of the photos are remarkably better -- even under the lowest resolution mode.  The image is improved in the at the two higher resolutions, but the number of images drops off markedly (from 190 to 14 and 9 with the basic 16 megs of memory)!  

I was impressed that, unlike other cameras (such as Canon's S30, the Olympus D-550, or Sony's  DSC-71), this comes with built in 16 megs of memory.  In the low resolution mode, 190 snapshots are a lot.  If you're going on a month-long adventure, or you want higher quality images, you can buy additional memory without having forgoe the basic one that came with your camera.  (I just got 64 meg addition for $40.  This increased memory to a whopping 900 photos at low resolution -- enough for a month-long vacation!  That means you could hold almost 3000 images with the 256 meg cards, or about 300 of the very high resolution ones)!

I was also concerned about shutter lag.  It's not that bad.  Though I find that for "action" shots I find it better to look through the viewfinder than at the LCD.  It's not nearly as fast as a 35mm (instant), but the shutter lag isn't a deal-killer, either.  I suspect the shutter lag will only be a problem if you are trying to shoot sports and other types of action. 

The camera not only does still images, but also full-motion video (with audio), and it can add audio to a still (though I haven't found this too useful).  Uploading images is relatively easy, and fairly fast with the USB port (even using it on a USB version 1 connection on a 133 Meg laptop).  (I can upload a dozen of the low resolution images in a minute via the 1.0 USB port.  This is probably 10 times as fast using the serial port on my video camera, and since old serial port connection "crashed" about half the time, this is at least 20 times faster! It would be about 40 times faster with a USB 2.0!).

If you have an HP printer, which we do (a nice trick to build a little brand loyalty, eh?), then printing a fullsize image is an easy three-step process (select the image, hook it up to the computer, press "print.")  I'm not sure about how the size of the image is controlled, but this is very easy with the printer software (I once had to print a photo for a locket.  I got in on the first run by selecting an album page with several sizes).

The main downside to the camera is it's size.  It's not small enough to fit in my shirt pocket like the Canon S30,  Olympus D-550, or Sony  DSC-71 (Epinions rates the other two "compact" but the HP as "standard.")  Practically, this means that it really requires a belt-clip case, or a backpack pocket.  If I were buying for myself, I think I'd opt for the smaller cameras, especially if my "test-drive" turned up evidence that they were just as easy to use.

As for batteries issue, the brightness of the flash suggests that the digital CCD isn't nearly as sensitive as even 100-speed film (more like 25), so the flash is pretty bright.  (It seems not to be as limited as the Canon S30 -- so far I haven't run out of flash, even as far as 6 feet).  It does burn through batteries, though.  I keep a second set charged whenever I want to take more than a dozen photos with a flash.  Unflashed, I can take about 50 photos, preview, and rotate them before burning through the batteries.  But as far as I can tell, battery use may not be any faster than other digital cameras.

One of the nicest aspect of a digital camera is the ability to delete images you don't want.  When you're shooting young kids, that's very helpful, because you're saving on a lot of not-very-good photos. The HP 720 makes the deletion of images, or their rotation, pretty easy.  So if you want to use a digital camera for shooting babies and such, I'd really recommend checking into the simplicity of viewing, deleting and maybe rotating the image.  I find the LCD viewer, at an inch and a half to be OK in evaluating the pictures for composition, brightness, and contrast.  But for fine detail, like expression and red-eye, I need to use the "zoom" feature on the display.   

UPDATE: 
After 3 months. Generally the camera is very well behaved.  I find it very easy to use.  But on several occasions (about 6) when flipping through previous photos, the camera has "jammed" on me.  I think it's that the memory gets overloaded, because it looks like when Windows "hung" for me.  The only way I've found to get "out" is to unload the batteries.  This takes the power out of the camera.  So far, I haven't lost any images.  But it is a bit annoying when it happens, as the clock need to be reset.  

After 6 months.  I just returned from a month-long trip to France.  I didn't bring my video cammera and tried to use the digital camera exclusively. I bought a 128 Meg SD card and a small bag.  Both made the trip fairly convenient.  I came back with over 500 images.  Most were the low resolution format that are fine for 4x6 prints and my website.  I also had a dozen video clips that are pretty low resolution and short, not a good substitute for the video camera at all.  But the medium resolutions shots I opted for in the last week (when it became clear that I wouldn't fill up the memory) are much nicer for larger prints.  Medium resolution is really overkill for 4x6s and web pages (they turn our to be larger than full-screen), but they are nice for larger prints.  There were shots that would have worked better with film (either because film would have been a little faster and not been "smeared" in the chateaux, or because I was shooting a high-contrast subject.  But the convenience of having a single camera with no film to keep track of was very nice, as was the ability to see the shots immediately.  The downsides were (1) I had to buy a battery charger, since I was burning through disposable batteries at an alarming rate, (2) the zoom wasn't nearly as powerful as my pocket 35mm, and (3) the full motion video probably isn't high enough quality or long enough to be worth it.
