            Vehicle purchased because of fold down rear seat and large storage capacity (Holds a 4x8 sheet).  A positive report by Consumer's Report helped us to make our decision.  We also liked the fact that the spare tire was accessible from inside the car instead of getting at it from under the car as was the case with the Mazda and Toyota minivans.

We are seniors and our legs get cramps in the older Non-Honda passenger and station wagons cars that we owned.  Our Honda is easy to handle and we are more comfortable after a long trip.  The back seat is easy to fold down which is a big plus for us since we use our minivan to transport toy soldiers to shows that we attend. The fold down back seat is easier to handle than removing it.

Another plus is gas mileage that runs around 22 to 26 miles per gallon of REGULAR gas depending on city or highway travel.

There are only 3 drawback to the car that we can identify.  We would have liked to have a sun roof which is available from other manufacturers.  We also would have preferred a tape recorder instead of the CD player which is standard with the basic car.  The last drawback is that the upholstery has a tendency to flatten if heavy loads are placed on it.  I suspect this can be corrected with a vacuum cleaner.

This car is great for campers, large families and businesses. 

We bought our car over the Internet and found that it was available without the $1500-2000 premium above the list price that many dealers are asking.  We also got scammed by the dealer that we bought from who promised us a better deal than another dealer.  The key to avoiding our problem is to make sure that all items promised by the dealer are listed BY MANUFACTURER'S CODE NUMBER &amp; EXACT DESCRIPTION on the invoice you sign. We wanted a roof rack with CROSS BARS.  The Dealer just wrote Roof Rack which is standard on the Honda Odyssey and we ended up paying an exorbitant amount for the sidebars.  Also, when you accept the car and it doesn't match the salesman's promises, sign your name with the words, UNDER PROTEST.  This may give you some legal recourse.
