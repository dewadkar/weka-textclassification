                 We just bought our Saturn SW1 a few weeks ago.  It is used with only 35000 miles on it.  We love it!  Although like any used car there are a few things wrong with it.  Let me start out with the bad and weigh them out with the good!
     When we bought the wagon it was dark outside so we really couldn't see much if anything was wrong with it.  But we were in need of a car that would fit our budget and we were really wanting a Saturn or a Windstar.  We fell in love with the Saturn after a 30minute test drive on the highways and in town.  We signed the papers and off we went!  That morning we looked closely at it and it was missing a panel on the driver side down under the dash, it had a few cigarette burns (3), and it was missing the net for the trunk.  But other then that it was fine. 
     After a week went by and it was dusty my husband walked up to the car to get in it and found three dents on the hood almost like it had been rolled.  But when he washed it those dents just disappeared.  We haven't said anything to anyone and no one has noticed.  Guess that is the good thing.  
     The other day I went to get my sons seat out of the car and when I did the seat was all deformed.  It had came apart from the rest of the car and folded over.  I don't know why it did that and it didn't make sense to my husband either, who has done his share of interior work.  Needless to say I think that Saturn could have put the car together a little better then they did.  Or maybe the people before us could have taken better car of it.
     The good news is that the good things out way the bad!  We love the system in it, it runs perfect, it didn't cost as much as most cars that are fully loaded like ours, it is perfect for a family of 4 or 5, and gets great gas mileage!  All of which for a van would be much higher.  Our payments are right in our budget and the car isn't family looking like most wagons.  Its sportage and fun! My husband is a hot rod kind of guy and if he likes it and loves to drive it just about any family man who gets embarrassed by wagons or vans &quot;family cars&quot; will love this!<br><br>
