            We bought this car new, for me.  Two years later, we bought the 1993 Honda Prelude, and my husband happily drove the Accord.  Two years ago, during my pregnancy, I no longer safely fit in the low-riding Prelude and re-inherited the Accord (also, the car seat doesn't fit properly in the Prelude.)  It is in great shape.  It has almost 300k miles and drives like new.  Yes, the interior is looking a bit beat up (spilled formula, milk, juice, etc) and the exterior is a tad shabby, but it runs like a dream!  It's a great family car.  It's comfortable for long trips, and my 6'1" husband loves that he isn't cramped like he is in the Prelude.  My air-conditioning went out this year, and we had it fixed. Well worth the cost.  This car has driven all over the country, and never broken down.  My husband is anal about timely oil changes and regular maintenance checks, and as much as I tease him, maybe that's why it's still in such great shape.  A few years back we thought of getting a newer model, but it wasn't as roomy as our model.  Our trunk is well proportioned, and holds plenty of stuff.  Every now and then I dream of getting a new car--but I've promised myself I would wait until I really NEED (not want) one---that day may never come!
