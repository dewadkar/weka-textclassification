            I bought this camera for work, but it really was a wonderful "fun time' camera as well.  I bought the D-460 and so far I really like it!  I did not know that much about digital cameras when I went searching, but I knew that I had to get one with at least 1.5 mega pixels, and that I wanted the ability to zoom. This camera fit the bill, and it was on sale at Staples for $450.00.

The first time I tried to figure it out I was not reading the manual, rule number one read the manual! The LCD screen is huge compared to the other models I was looking at. It makes it so much easier! 

I found the menu was easy to understand and follow. There are so many adjustments you can make, even one for if you are under flouresent lighting. One of my other favorite adjsutments is the level of quality. The better the quality, the fewer photos you can take. I bought a 32 mb card to go with this camera because they come with a 8mb. I down load my jpgs on a regular basis, so I don't need a card bigger than a 32mb.  I believe my 32 mb holds 73 jpgs on the "super high quality" format. 

I found the installation of the software very easy, and I use that software for all of my photos now.  The download time is the only thing that is a drag- literaly- it takes forever! I think it is that my computer is SLOW, so not everyone has this issue.

The most amazing thing I have put this camera through is a crash and burn on the pavement. I was walking quickly on a crowded sidewalk, and I thought I had the wrist strap around my wrist.... so I flung the camera out so I could catch it in a more comfortable position in my hand. Well the wrist strap was not on my wrist, so the camera went flying (literaly) about 15 feet, then crashed to the ground bouncing 3 times end over end. I thought the end of the camera was here. People on the street even moaned when they saw the show. I picked it up, and while it has a few battle scars on the outer shell, it still worked like a champ! Now that is durability!

One tip I learned in Las Vegas.... Do not use the LCD screen while taking pictures if you want to save on your battery life. It is the LCD that Zaps those batteries. I installed new batteries in Las Vegas, and the man at the camera shop told me not to use the LCD if I wanted to make it through the trip without coming back to the shop. WAS HE RIGHT! I snapped all 73 photos WITH flash, and have taken an additional 73 since my trip and the battery life is still 100%! I was amazed! So if you really do not need the cool LCD while snapping, turn it off!
