            hmmm....the new beetle - or a GTI? Tough choice until I sat in the VR6. Wow! Fit &amp; finish far superior to the beetle, an interior laid out with a bit more logic, and those SEATS! The test drive sealed it. When the salesman can quote the stats from memory, and pushes serious gees leaving the lot, you get the feeling he digs the car.
Good choice after all. The new GTI retains much of the traditional feel - upright seating, awesome gearbox and some pretty tight cornering - while boasting a hedonistic interior with tons of tight german leather and some pretty wild black wood trim. A driver's compartment with tilt/telescopic wheel, height adjustable seating &amp; lumbar on both buckets. - The 6 hour drive up to Vermont was a joy.
1000 miles so far, and no problems yet (knock, knock). I'm enjoying the stealth aspects of the car. Gone is the sport black trim we remember for the GTI (although they still use it in europe). No one knows what you've got until they spot the badges in the rear lid.
I've heard a few gripes about rear seat room, but I've done 4 adults with no complaints. The front seats move up &amp; out of the way for entry, just watch your toes when putting the seat back down again.
One note - the VR6 only comes in a standard transmission - but if you don't know how to drive one I advise you to learn. Driving shouldn't be this much fun.<br><br>
