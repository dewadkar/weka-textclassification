            With over 124,000 miles, my '89 Crown Victoria still runs as nicely as the day I bought it! This great car is now my son's car for college (read my Bowling Green State University review), and it is a great car for people and hauling all that stuff to college and back.

I bought my '89 Crown Victoria in the early months of 1990 and got a great price because it was a leftover.  Mechanically, this car has been the best! Aside from normal wear and tear items, the seals on the power steering pump have been replaced, and there was a wiring problem related to the battery which was repaired under warranty when the car was only a month or two old. This car has been used to tow my tent camper, and since I was towing, I added an after market transmission cooler, class II hitch and wiring, and cargo coil springs. This vehicle has adequate power for towing, but you will have to take it easy on the long steep grades and equip the vehicle properly. This car has served us well, including a long trip out to South Dakota and numerous camping trips and vacations around the country. The engine and power train runs as smoothly today as when it was new. When not towing, I've always gotten around 18+ miles to the gallon, and when towing my 2.000 lbs. plus trailer, I still get around 15 mpg. With proper maintenance and care, I'm sure this car will go for 200,000 miles.

I'm a fan of Crown Vics because of their comfortable ride,capacity for people and luggage, and durability. The one negative I have is that the original paint did oxidize and fade (it wasn't a clear-coat paint) and I did have the car repainted three years ago. However, other older Crown Vics with clearcoat paints seem to have held up better.

Since the Crown Vic is not the most popular car with younger people (let's face it, most of them are police cars or owned by the 50+ generation), there are some great deals to be found! If you are looking for a nice large sedan, give the Crown Vic some consideration.<br><br>
