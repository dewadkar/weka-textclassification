            I read some of the opinions here and it's obvious that one can't really form an opinion of this vehicle unless you have driven it for some time.

It is only after a while and after the vehicle is fully broken in that you appreciate its true value and its genuine status as a true Volvo. I was in the market for a car actually and began considering a wagon as I needed extra cargo space on the odd occasion. At the same time, I wanted some performance, sporty looks and driving comfort. 

I think the Volvo V40 fits the bill and offers the creature comforts that one expects from a well made car. The seats are extremely comfortable and although it takes a while to adjust the power seats to the right setting, once set, it is a delight to sit in and fatigue is absolutely out of the question even after a very long drive. Go for the leather seats, if you decide on this vehicle, it's definitely worth the extra $ you pay. Also, get the sport package and the cold weather package, which gets you the dynamic stability assistance, fog lights and heated front seats. The heater works fine and provides enough warmth on wintry mornings. I live in Boston and it's great to have this option. The defroster also heats the mirrors on each side and the rear window. 

Overall, I have found the car very satisfactory and it does perform well on the highway, on steep, winding roads and ramps and has incredible stability even on the sharpest turns. There is a slight roll but overall, the car feels so stable that you scarcely worry about it. The DSA works well on icy ramps and braking is absolutely superb. 

What I like most about the car is its nimble feel on the road. The suspension is a little stiff and you do feel the road more than most luxury cars and I guess, that's a good thing as it keeps you alert. Passing is excellent and so is the acceleration. This car grows on you and I would say that it performs really well after you have driven about say, 2 or 3 thousand miles. As always, frequent oil changes, one at 500 to 600 miles, one at 1200 and the next at 3000 miles will really help you break the car well. 

The interior is quite luxurious and the only thing I don't like about the car is the position of the middle cupholders which is awkward and interferes with the positioning of the driver's armrest. The other gripes are the poor &quot;premium&quot; quality radio and tape player. The CD is really good and if you don't care much about radio or tape, I would stick with the existing sound system. 

The car is really fun to drive and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's not really looking for something big. Despite the Mitsubishi association, this is a true Volvo and it has the look and feel of a real, solid car. At times [ within the first 2 K miles ], I did almost regret getting this car but it has grown on me and I now absolutely love it and can't wait to drive it every morning to work. There's something about the car that makes you care for it more and more, the longer you own it. 

The last thing, no comments from anyone on this being a &quot;boxy&quot; Volvo. All my friends have admired the car after I took them on a spin and showed them what this vehicle is capable of. They were also surprised by the cargo room [ without folding down the seats ] and while rear seating will be difficult for very tall or large adults, the average adult should be able to relax in them comfortably [ 2 adults only, though - adding a third could be pretty cramped ]
