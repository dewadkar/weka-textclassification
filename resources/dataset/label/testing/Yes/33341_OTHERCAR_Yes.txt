            My family owned a 1992 Plymouth Voyager for 10+ years, and it was great while it lasted. The ol' girl stuck it out for <b>10+ years and 133,000 miles</b> of highway commutes, stop-and-go commutes, and trips from Chicago to places like Kansas City and Washington, D.C. It also survived a minor accident, crashing into shopping carts, drag racing in parking lots, and several scrapes with garages and pillars.

The two front bucket seats are very comfy. The driver's seat was replaced in our van after about 8 years of heavy use. That was the only part of the interior of the car that ever needed replacement. The instrument panel is ugly, but functional. One complaint is that it does not have a tachometer. The gear shifter is located on the right side of the steering wheel. Occasionally it would need a good sharp yank if it was parked and needed to go in reverse down a slope, like a driveway. Other than that, shifting was easy.

The air conditioning never failed my family, even on the hottest days. For people sitting in the middle or back seats, it may be too hot since there are only air vents in the front of the car.

The single sliding door was heavy, but never caused problems for me. A helpful thing inside the Voyager is a large handle on the back of the front passenger's seat. For senior citizens or people who need help getting into the van, this is great.

The seats' positions can be changed, but with great difficulty. They are very heavy and not easily fit into the slots in the floor. They can be folded down easily though.

The acceleration on this was pitiful, but that is to be expected of a very large car with a small engine. There was also quite a bit of engine noise - but this can be either good or bad, depending if you're trying to impress people.

Though it has some bad points, I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a simple minivan with great value.
