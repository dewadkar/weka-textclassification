            In this ever expanding digital world of ours, where free time is our most valuable commodity, one can get easily buried in the mass of information, specifications, pixelations and operations of the plethora of digital cameras that are available.

For many, where digital photography is a big part of their lives, choosing a suitable camera with a multitude of options and megapixels is a necessity.  For others, who simply want to have fun taking pictures with a single 'click' and easily upload those pictures to their PC for viewing/printing/emailing, the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a camera they'll never fully exploit prohibited them from this digital realm.

But Polaroid knew there was a market out there for a low-cost, moderately functional digital camera that could be accessible to everyone.  After initially coming out with their 320 model digital camera which, for $20, offered a very poor digital photo, they've re-thought their method and direction and have come out with the <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b>. 

The <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b> offers twice the resolution of their earlier 320 model - producing images of 640 x 480 pixel resolution.  In the megapixel world, that equates to about 1/3 of 1 megapixel.  That being the case, the images are adequate for viewing on the screen, but they don't print out with any level of quality that you would receive with a 2.1 or better megapixel camera.  But that's really not the purpose of the <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b>.  It's more for having fun, emailing pictures, uploading them to your website and more.  Want good quality printable digital images? Look elsewhere.

The <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b> has few features, but what it does have works well.  There's a 15-second self timer which is easy to use.  The optical view-finder seems to line up the image accurately.  An LCD display indicates how many images you have taken (maximum of about 15), whether the memory is full, and whether there isn't sufficient light to properly expose the image. And, of course, there's a delete picture button which works on a 3-second delay (as to avoid accidental deletions).

The internal memory (1 megabyte) isn't removable like other digital cameras, so the only way to extract the pictures are to hook up the camera to your PC and dump them.  Connection to your PC is a snap with the included combination USB and serial port connector.  Included with the camera is the appropriate driver software to allow you to retrieve the pictures (Saved as JPG files).  Additionally, there's a nice, moderately powerful, image viewing/editing software called PhotoMax.  

The low-light indicator will still allow you to take a picture, however unless you have the camera mounted on a tri-pod (or other stationary item) the image may come out fuzzy and/or distorted. And since this camera doesn't come equipped with a flash (Model 820 does), you'll want to insure the camera is steady in those low light situations. Outdoors, in full light, the images are typically more vibrant and colorful - capturing a fair amount of details.  Colors and flesh tones all seem pretty accurate with a decent light source.

The casing of the <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b> is made of a light-weight, moderately durable silver plastic.  For those of you who, like myself, equate heft in electronics with quality and durability, you'll know immediately that this camera does not contain either.  A drop to the floor resulted in the battery compartment opening and the camera body itself splitting open.  But everything snapped back together and the camera worked fine, so there is some durability here.  Additionally, the style and grip of the camera are both ergonomic and comfortable.

The <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b> runs on 4 AA batteries (also included with the camera) and since there's no flash or color LCD display to drain their power, they should last for you hundreds of exposures.  The auto-off feature insures you don't drain the batteries unintentionally as well.

For around $30, the <b>Fun! 620 Digital Camera</b> offers a fair amount of features and performance.  Absent a flash and any zoom capabilities, this is a basic point and shoot digital camera that's a perfect way to break into the digital medium, or just play around with some low-cost, fun digital photography.

The price certainly is right.  And you get what you pay for.

Thanks, as always, for reading.
