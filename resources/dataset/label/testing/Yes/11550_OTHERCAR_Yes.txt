            We selected the Jeep Cherokee Sport because it was a well built vehicle for the price.  We drove several other 4 wheel drive vehicles, they were either too big, too expensive, did not drive or handle nicely etc. We wanted a 4 wheel drive vehicle that was comfortable, roomy, and durable without spending $30,000+.  The quality of the interior is good and the seats are comfortable.  It offers a fairly smooth ride. This vehicle handles nicely too. 4 wheel drive works wonderfully, we just had over a foot of snow and it rode through without any problems.   This is our first 4 wheel drive vehicle and we would purchase another Jeep when the time comes to get another vehicle.<br><br>
