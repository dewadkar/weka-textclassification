            I wasnt too hip to the idea of a minivan and really wanted some sort of jeep.We bought our Dodge Grand Caravan (sport) just after our third child was born. With a five year old and a two year old who was still in a car seat I wondered how I would manage carrying the baby seat, locking it in then having to struggle with our two year old and praying that the oldest would be able to buckle himself up. The second I found out there was a van out there with sliding doors on BOTH sides plus bucket seats behind the drivers I knew I had to have it.  With this minivan I take a kid and my husband takes one and we easily buckle them into their car seats which FIT SAFE and theres no hurting your back or straining to reach in. Our five year old loves having the back seat to himself. The only thing I might change about our van is the hand bars attached to the back of the driver and passenger seat. They get in the way just a little when our five year old climbes in and the two year old likes to bang his feet on it. When our baby was facing the back the bar seemed like it wouldnt be safe (lined right up where his head was) should we get in an accident. Still we are very pleased with our car.<br><br>
