            The new 323 coupe definitely looks great, no other car in its class compares in design . . . although BMW could have done a better job on the engine. The 2.5 liter BMW produces only 170hp and 181 lb of torque. The car also puts a big a hole in your wallet costing about 30k. The new Nissan Maxima, which is also about 30k is faster than the new BMW but surely lacks in looks. The 323 reaches 0-60 mph in 7.1 seconds while the Maxima reaches 60 mph in the high 6's. 

The 323 is recommended for those who want a comfortable and great looking car. The 323 comes with optional 17&quot; rims and high gloss trim for the interior and exterior. This is included in the sports package and adds a nice touch to the already great looking car. It also comes in many colors, the favorite of mine is the metallic blue color. When you go to the dealer and see this color the wet paint look will make you fall in love with the car at first sight.

This car is not recommended for those who want a performance car. Although the 323 does perform very well it is not up to optimal BMW expectations. BMW has produced some very high performance cars but this 323 is not one of them. Of BMW's models the M-series is the class to buy from if you are looking for performance. <br><br>
