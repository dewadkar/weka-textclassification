              I looked fairly extensively at the numerous small SUV's out on the market.  Hands down the Amigo was the way to go.  I have the soft top version which is awesome during warmer months.  I also do quite a bit of camping and some biking and when you fold down the rear seat you have tons of space.  That was my biggest reason for choosing the Amigo over a Wrangler.  Even without the seat up you still have adequate room for a weekend trip with 4 adults and their luggage. 
  Also, within a week it is easy to take the top down and up.  I can now have all the windows out, including the sunroof, and put everything together in less than 2 minutes.  And trust me, when it's nice out there is nothing better than dropping the top and cruising around town.  I also love that this vehicle is small enough to fit into tight parking spaces if you live in the city.  
  My only real problem with this vehicle is during the non-warm months.  You get so used to driving a vehicle that is pure fun and exhilaration that during the winter it is like driving anything else.  Of course, since I do have a soft top it is a problem during the winter with windows becoming frosted up and there not being a rear window defroster.  That really is my only qualm.  Otherwise, everyone that rides in it loves it including anyone riding in the backseat (getting in the back is a problem though).  So, if you want a fun, good looking, and roomy vehicle for those that really like to not have a one dimensional truck, then the Amigo is the clear choice.<br><br>
