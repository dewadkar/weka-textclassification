            The Canadian built Camaro is an American icon of the past, present, and (HOPEFULLY) future.  This car has one of the strongest followings of any car on the road, and for good reason.  This particular model year is as smooth as these cars will ever become.

The 2001 Chevrolet Camaro retains the aggressive 2+2 styling of the original, and also continues to offer the consumer a extremely tenacious handling car.  The standard 2001 Chevrolet Camaro comes in coupe this year with the convertible version being discontinued in Canada.  (AWWW!!!)

The 2001 Chevrolet Camaro is home to a very gutsy 3.8l V6 engine, putting 200 horses and 225 lb/ft of torque to the asphalt, which lies below the rear wheels.  A 5-speed manual gearbox is standard, while a 4-speed slush box can also be had.  An aluminized stainless steel exhaust system is optional on all models.

Stopping is carried out via four-wheel disc brakes with ABS and a very neat/ingenious electronic throttle control is also standard.  (NICE)  The handling and steering are configured exactly as they should be for a car of this nature. 

The standard suspension consists of an independent short arm/long arm suspension in the front paired with a �Salisbury� axle with two trailing arms in the rear.  A simple yet, effective setup.  Rear axle hop is still apparent but only when on top of rough pavement where acceleration is the directive measure being completed.

The suspension also features stabilizer bars in the rear, and gas-charged carbon shock absorbers for both the front and rear.  As an additional option all these bits can be upgraded to the optional Performance Handling Package which adds 16-inch touring tires, painted or chromed wheels, a revised steering ratio, and dual exhaust outlets with a rather useless (in my �epinion�) limited slip differential.

Trunk volume is surprisingly generous for a car with a profile like the one seen on the Camaro.  Although the instrument panel is packed, the dashboard layout is well thought out and rather simple looking.  My only gripe is the materials used in the various bits and pieces within look kind of cheap.

I perhaps say this because the bar has been raised so high in terms of interior quality by other car makers.  (Most notably the new interiors provided by new market players such as Daewoo and KIA.)  These companies prove that a quality/expensive interior has nothing to do with the MSRP on the car.

Standard air conditioning and power door lock and windows, are standard equipment.  So are cruise control, tilt steering wheel, and a power remote trunk.  (yes!)  The 2001 Chevrolet Camaro is also equipped with an AC Delco AM/FM stereo with CD player.  A premium 8-speaker Monsoon speaker system can also be had.

This particular audio system is very well thought out and sounds to say the least wonderful.  I would highly recommend this upgrade for true music audiophiles. I would venture to say even it is better than those systems found on high end Japanese luxury cars.  (read Lexus)

The safety features include dual reduced force deployment air bags for both front passengers.  The 2001 Chevrolet Camaro also features the famous Gm PASS-Key theft deterrent system, battery rundown protection, and the always useful 24 hour roadside assistance.

In closing, the 2001 Chevrolet Camaro is a very unique car in that it is one, which carries a distinctive past.  This car has been compared and tested with others of the like for decades, and hopefully the (smarter) heads at GM will decide to continue and even improve on this true American automotive icon.

In my seven days in evaluating this car I must admit there were times when I was crusin� about my neighborhood reliving the memories I had as a 20 something young man with the killer ride of his dreams.  Unfortunately this never happened, as my ride at the time was a Ford Taurus.  Hey that is all I could afford at the time.  Hey, at least I am honest.
