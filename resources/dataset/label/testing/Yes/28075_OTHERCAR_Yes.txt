            2001 Chevrolet Impala. Is it a car for you? Well I might answer that question. In my traveling with the car was pleasing it had good handling, nice comfort, really roomy for family of four or five, good trunk space for the travelers that like to pack things (I know I do).The 2001 Impala is not as big as prev models and has more saftey features and better gas mileage(only takes about 15 dollars to filler up) even though
it looks like a gas guzzuller.It may be a passenger car but it still feels and looks like driving a luxury car. Well I enjoyed my time I had with the car and hopefully you will too.
