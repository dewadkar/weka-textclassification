            I purchased my 1999 Monte Carlo LS used in November of 2000.  The sporty look of the car attracted me, but the comfort, performance and luxury of the car are what sold me on it.
It isn't a huge behemoth, but feels substantial when it is being driven.  The engine is a 3.1 liter V-6 that provides enough horse power to climb hills and pass slower vehicles.  The interior is luxurious and the controls are easy to use.  It has lots of passenger room, front and back seat.  The trunk is huge and can be accessed from the fold-down rear seat back.  It is a comfortable car for long trips, but it isn't too big to use for commuting.   I take the car in for regular maintenance, and it still runs beautifully after travelling 50,000 miles.
