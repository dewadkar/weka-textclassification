            Perhaps I'm biased - after all, my last car was a 1989 Grand Marquis, that I almost hated to trade in!  But, with less than a year to retirement, I thought it prudent to replace it while I was still gainfully employed.

I shopped on the Internet, but still wound up getting a quote from my regular dealer.  I was surprised that the final price included a $1500 rebate, that was not included in the original quote!

Purchased with the &quot;performance&quot; option, this car's quickness belies its quite considerable weight.  The fully independent suspension was another surprise: this is one of the last of the rear-drive passenger cars available, and this suspension makes the ride much more sure-footed.

I haven't been able to test its abilities on snow or ice, but with the Anti-lock Braking System and Traction control, it should be MUCH better than my last Gran Marquis.

All of this combines to make for a very pleasurable drive, but one that keeps the driver feeling very much in control.

Like so many of the cars of all sizes built today, the inability to see any of the &quot;corners&quot; gives me a &quot;thrill&quot; every time I have to park in close quarters!  I have (semi-) seriously considered getting a set of those plastic rods I see on some Tractor-trailers!

All-in-all, though, for a person who feels more secure in a rear-drive vehicle, and prefers comfort over economy (29 mpg average city and highway) this vehicle is hard to beat.  The regular Ford Motor Co. warranty was also a suirprise, complete with on-the-road service; I am seriously considering terminating my AAA membership!

For those who like go zigzagging through tight traffic, or who wouldn't like feeling like they were berthing a ferry when parking, then perhaps a smaller car would be a better choice.<br><br>
