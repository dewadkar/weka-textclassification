            Our company just moved up from an Olympus 600 to this model, and I couldn't be happier.

As the Marketing Manager for a large construction company, I am always taking pictures of our current &quot;jobs in progress&quot;.  With this new camera, the photos look terrific - the resolution is excellent.   It's hard to believe this is digital, and not regular film.  I generally take photos at a fairly high resolution, but even with that, I can fit 64 photos on a 32MB disk, which is always more than enough for one jobsite.  

The size of the camera is also much improved.  It's light, easy to handle, and fits in my purse or laptop case easily.  Downloading pictures is a snap as well.  I usually use the adaptor disk for my computer, but the laser transfer is simple as well.

There are a couple of things that could be improved upon, in my opinion.  For one, the lens cap is always falling off.  I know that sounds pretty minor, but it can be a pain!  Needs to have a better way to clip on to the camera lens for protection.   Second, it takes too long to scroll through all the menu options to change a setting.  Needs to be simplified.

All in all though, I love this camera.  It's all I use any more - for home photos, for jobsite photos, and for those special events as well.  Try it - I guarantee you'll like it!<br><br>
