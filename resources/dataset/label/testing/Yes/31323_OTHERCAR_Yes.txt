            Let me begin by saying that this truck in every mechanical sense is the same as a Ford Ranger.  That being said, let us now say why this is a much better buy.

First of all, I started looking for a Truck in September of 1998.  I needed something to haul around junk on occasion, but not all the time.  Concurrently, I needed something to get me to work and be dependent yet economic with gas.  My search for quality took me to the Toyota dealership, however the sticker seriously shocked me.  Taking a look at the Toyota was instinctive since the only thing my family has ever owned were Toyotas.  

Trucks, since they are so closely related to the SUV craze have started to command a premium.  The most affordable major brand I could think of was the Ford Ranger.  I went to the Ford Dealership and found that the truck was of very good quality, and that for the extra cab and the extra equipment I wanted (i.e. power windows, doorlock, and a/c) it was very well priced.  At the time it was around $17,000 .  I almost bought it, but I decided to keep looking just in case.  

I read in the paper that Mazda was having trouble with their inventory that year and that they were not selling as well as they would have hoped because they did not have an SUV in their stable yet.  Why I never thought of them, I don't know, but that is probably why most other people don't think of them when they start looking for a truck.  In most peoples mind Mazda is the company that makes the Miata or RX-7. 

When I did my research on the Internet, it said that it was identical to the Ranger except for the Front Facia.  So I looked up pictures, and I fell in love.  In my opinion, the front looks far more sophisticated than the Ranger.  I called the nearest Dealership to me which at the time was in Livermore CA. and asked about pricing.  He said he could get it to me but there was only one left with the features I wanted, and it would cost around $17000.  By the time I got there it was sold.  He tried to sell me an upgrade, but I couldn't afford it.  At the time it was November.

I kept looking and then in December I called a dealership in San Jose, and they said that they could get it to me for $16000.  Needless to say I got my girlfriend and rushed to the dealership.  When I got there I started to haggle.  I hadn't even seen the car but I knew the specs by heart.  Finally right before we agreed on a price of $14000 plus tax lic, and warranty (yes I got the warranty because it was my first American car, and yes they went down $2000) the salesman asked me if I wanted to see the vehicle.  So I agreed, and when I saw it, you could have seen my jaw drop.

It looks exactly like the picture that is posted on this site.  No kidding.  It is the burgundy with beige two tone, tinted windows, raised supspension, and bed lining.  This was better than I thought it would be.  I thought I was gonna get a weird color like baby blue or something.  Instead the truck I got was absolutely gorgeous.  For only $14k! 

I got inside and it had everything I wanted, and more.  It had cruise control, CD player, and cover for the cab. This was better equipped than the Ranger. I bought the truck and have been happy ever since.  

I currently have 30k miles on it and have been to the snow, up and down California, and have helped friends move several times.  (Only drawback to owning a truck is that everybody thinks of you when they have to move stuff)

I highly recommend this truck to anyone who is not a speed racer, it isn't speedy, and is a single person without having to haul 4-5 people all the time.  You can, but it isn't comfortable.  The truck is best with 2 people, 3 max.  Another thing is, take a look at the front of the truck and then compare it to the Ranger.  You will see that the Mazda is much better styled. 

Lastly, during the family christmas party I found out that one of my cousins bought a Tacoma.  Not as nicely equipped, but it did have the extra cab.  He paid $18000 for it.  Everybody was chiding me for buying a Mazda instead of the Toyota.  I didn't tell them it was really a Ford.  However when they looked at them and did the comparisons, as all families do, they liked my truck better.  Then came the kicker.  I told them how much I paid, and that won them over.  They oohed and aahed at the truck and kept asking to take it for test drives.  

I am not saying this truck is as good as a Toyota, but for less money, you get a lot more features in a decent good quality, truck.  If you take care of it properly, there is no reason it should not last you 10 years.<br><br>
