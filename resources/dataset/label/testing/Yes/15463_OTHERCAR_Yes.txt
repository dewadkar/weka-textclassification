            This camera is just loaded with great features. The resolution isn't as good as on some of the more pricey cameras, but it's excellent for non-professionals. I got mine because I wanted to be able to take pictures and mini-movies of sporting events. The movie feature is great. You can record up to 15 seconds at 320x240 resolution and 60 seconds on 160x112 resolution. It'd be great for filming little snippets of your kids or anyone. You can easily add audio and video to a web site if you know a little html or have a program that will do it for you. The optical zoom is a really nice feature. It zooms up to 8x, which is equal to 328mm on a 35mm camera. I highly recommend this camera.<br><br>
