            <b>This truck is fantastic.</b>

Ever since buying this truck 10 months ago, it hasn't had one major problem.

The only problem it has had, was the fact that we blew a fuse when trying to hook up an old trailer to it.

We replaced the fuse, and its been the same ever since.

We bought this '98 in January of 2000, and only spent $12,000 out the door!!

We went shopping for a truck one morning, and found this on to only have 17,000 miles on it, still in prime condition, and the dealership have a $1,000 of everything sale.

A deal like this can't be passed up, so we bought it, and have been happy ever since.

This vehicle is very comfortable, and has a good amount of leg room in the whole cab area.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a truck to 4-wheel in, tow with, or just drive.

The only downside, is the model we bought was a V-4 5.0L, but has manual transmission, that makes up for some power loss.<br><br>
