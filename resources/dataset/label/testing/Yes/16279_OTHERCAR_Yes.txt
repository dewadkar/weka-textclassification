            I think there are a lot of car buyers out there that are like me.  We need a roomy vehicle to haul cargo with yet don't want to give up on getting a car that handles well, accelerates nicely and gets good gas mileage.  In short we really DO want some sport with our utility for once, and we're not talking off road "sport" here either.  In short "Sport Crossovers" like the Aerio SX make tons of sense.  The Aerio has as much interior volume as the Toyota 4Runner yet outruns it, out brakes it, out corners it and gets roughly twice the gas mileage and costs half as much.  Seems like an easy choice to me. 

Certainly the Aerio SX has competitors and there are many car magazine reviews out there that'll tell you the Aerio is the worst of 'em all.  They harp on the Aerio for having a DIGITAL dashboard, horror or horrors and uncomfortable back seats and they hate the styling.  I for one have never had the digital dash "wash out" on me and I find it easy to read.  Furthermore the small overall size of the digital dash mean it's seldom obstructed by the steering wheel.  The magazines gloss over the fact that the Aerio has the best shifter, the most interior room and is faster that all except the $22K Matrix XRS.  They also gloss over the fact that the SX is 15-20% cheaper than its cheapest competitors.  That low price and the crazy 0% financing for 5 years Suzuki is now offering make it the clear bargain in the segment over the Vibe/Matrix twins, the PT Cruiser or the Protege 5.  

Driving the Aerio is a joy.  The car feels as light on it's feet as it is, a mere 2600 lbs.  It's a car that is GREAT around town.  It's narrow width allows it to squirt in and out of traffic easily and the ultra small turning radius makes parking a breeze.  Big tall long doors open wide and the high seating makes ingress/egress better than most any car at any price.  

The Aerio cruises well out on the freeway as well.  A tall 5th gear means the engine is turning a leisurely 2500 RPM at 65MPH.  This helps keep 4 cylinder engine noise at bay where other cars in it's class just buzz along like mad. The Aerio can get away with this tall gearing because it's motor is tuned as much for high torque output as well as horsepower.  Sure the Aerio's 145 HP tops it's class but where the motor really steps out from the crowd is the torque output.  The 130  lb/ft are available at a relatively low 3000 RPM.  The Vibe/Matrix and Protege don't generate peak torque until 5500 RPM, quite a difference I'd say.  Passing usually requires a downshift for real power but shifting is so much fun and the grip falls so readily to hand that you find yourself doing it without thinking before long.

So to recap, don't believe the magazines as they are stupid and vain.  They can't see past the digital dashboard and funky styling (which I love) and forget that the Aerio is the fastest and roomiest in it's class.  They also seem to forget that it's the most inexpesive of the lot.  With the money I saved on my Aerio I'm installing new 16" wheels/tires, a Cold Air Intake and a new high flow exhaust.  Soon I'll be waving bye to even the Matrix XRS and Vibe GT onwers who spent 5 grand more.  Wow that's nearly 25% by my calculations!
