                I bought a pre-owned Ruby red 92 Lexus ES 300 with a mere 17,000 miles on it in the spring of 1994. I drive 40,000 miles + per year so buying 1-2 year old low mileage cars is a good strategy which works for me. I kept my car for about 2 years and then sold it for just a few thousand less than I'd paid for it. 

    My mom wanted to buy my car, because she loved it more than any car she'd driven before, except for the color. Because she also drives alot (about 25,000 yearly) I wouldn't sell her my car, but I did help her find an ES 300 of her own. Her car had 40,000 miles on it when she bought it and now has 130,000 miles. I counseled her to sell her's before reaching 100,000 miles (like I usually do) so she would not lose too much on depreciation like she had in the past on her Mercedes Benz and Cadilacs. (never buy a new Cadilac unless you have an aversion to money! Ouch!) 

   I found her a 92 pearl white with graphite interior up in Phoenix that was in perfect condition. Her car has the excelent cloth upholstery that wears like Iron and allways looks perfect, Unlike the leather seats in my car, that despite being more comfortable to sit on (for me)looked a bit shop worn by the time I sold my car.
    These cars are wonderfull to drive. They seem to glide along the road silently which, as I recall, made it difficult to judge speed acurately until I got used to it. The steering is extremely light and lacks road feel, but is wonderful when parking or maneuvering in tight quarters, and in emergency situations. These cars look sporty but do not like to tackle the twisties. Everytime I try to drive fast around the curves I find myself slowing down to a more leisurely pace automaticaly which goes against my nature, so it must be the car. This car love's to go fast though when the road is smooth and straight. The faster you drive in these cars the more stable they feel, I think this must have something to do with aerodynamics or something. Most cars get &quot;twitchy&quot; at speeds over 100 mph, letting the driver know that they are driving too fast even if he is not watching his speedometer! When I first bought my ES 300 I had an experience while driving through Montana that I will never forget. I was traveling east on I-90 going slightly downhill on a long grade when I saw a highway patrol (going the other way) flashing his headlights at me. As he got closer he flashed his blue light briefly and then (looking directly at me) motioned for me to slow down, I looked down at the speedometer to see why he looked so woried and my heart rose in my throat when I saw the needle pointing at the 120 mph mark! I stepped on the fabulous brakes and shaved off about 35 mph in short order. I did not get a ticket. (thank god!) I have owned and driven S Class Mercedes, That dont inspire as much confidence at tripple digit speeds as my Lexus did.

   On a few occasions I had to hit the brakes hard and was amazed at how controlable the car was in a panic stop, the best I've experienced so far in any car regardless of price. In fact if you look up stopping distances in one of the major car magazines you will find out that Lexus stopping distances are in a league with cars like the Corvette, Porsche, Ferrari, BMW M series etc. I know that the excelent anti-lock brakes saved me from at least one bad accident. If I'd been in any other car I'd previously owned that day I would probably be dead or seriously injured now, but I was able to steer around the accident instead.

    The ES 300  has one of the best air conditioners on the market, it cools the interior very fast making the Lexus an excelent choice in hot climates. The standard stereo is made by Pioneer and has excelent sound quality for a factory unit.

    I had no problems whatsoever with my car for the 2 years I owned it. (except for shocks, tires, brakes and 1 battery) Mom has not been so lucky though, the first year the a/c compresor developed a hum and had to be replaced under waranty. The factory radiator cap failed causing the engine to boil over. (The same thing just happened again this summer so I put on an aftermarket cap this time instead of the Lexus one.) Her rear windows make a horrible clank when they are lowered, or when the car hits a big bump, and sometimes refuse to seal themselves. The sunroof wont seal anymore either and is getting quite noisy. The power steering hoses developed leaks 2 years ago and were very expensive to replace. Right after that the radiator split along the front causing the car to lose coolant and overheat again. 

   This year her car would not pass emisions and required $2000 in repairs to get it to pass. The factory shock absorbers on the rear failed and lost all their fluid at 65,000 miles. (about 2 months apart) She replaced those with 4 KYB's for about $500 because the Lexus ones must have diamonds in them or something. (She went to Paris for a week on the money she saved!) The new shocks are still working good, but all four of the top mounts (originals still) are worn out which causes a clanking sound on bumps and a jiggly ride. The foam on the top of the steering wheel has unbonded from the metal core. It still looks ok but feels funny in your hands sometimes. 

   The fabric on the seats looks new except where the sun hits the top of the back seat which is causing it to lighten a bit. Also the cloth on the rear speakers is no longer black it has become purple. Some interior trim pieces have come loose because the flimsy clips break. The antennas only last for about 3 years before breaking in half. The vinyl covering on the doors is so thin that it tears easily with little provocation.

   Some things I dont like about this car are the short gearing which is not very well suited for traversing our vast continent, (but I'm sure is just fine in Tokyo.) The engine is turning over so many rpm's at 95 that the fuel economy drops to about 17 mpg. One time I drove mom's car along behind a moving truck for 1200 miles that would only go 60 and I got 32 mpg! which ilustrates the drawback to the gearing. There is not enough &quot;real legroom&quot; for the driver because the pedals are to close causing me a severe case of &quot;Lexus knee&quot; after a long drive and a low back ache as well.(I'm 6'2&quot;) Also the footwell is so cramped that I cant get my feet around the pedals to strech out on long trips unless I drive barefoot. I have exactly the same problem in the 2001 ES 300's but not in any of the German or Swedish cars I've driven. <br><br>
