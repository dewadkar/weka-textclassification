            This DC280 ZOOM is a testament to the fact that new technology doesn't always have to be too complicated for new consumers. In other words, you don't have to sacrifice quality, efficience and innovation for accessibility.

The interface is extremely simple and can be quickly learned by the average chimp. There is a small window on the hind side that will display pictures, menus and commands. This window can be used as a view finder or just a reviewer. Unfortunately, constant use of this window will use up massive quantities of battery power but it is an option. Using this window can allow you to take pictures of people without them knowing because you are holding it away from your face.This window is small but has a nice resolution and a contrast adjustment that sharpens or lightens the picture.  

The command knob on the back is easy and quick to use. There is a position for taking pictures (capture). The next notch down is for viewing, editing, deleting, or cycling through your previously taken pictures (review). Turning the knob further there is the option to connect to your computer and download pictures for e-mail, photo management, further editing or pasting onto a web page (connect).  

And finally there is the menu you can use to change options in the actual shooting of the pictures. Borders can be added, color can be taken out or a Sepia tone can be imposed upon the pictures.  Flash and color adjustments abound and it is all very easy and quick to change.

The camera is also very light and easy to carry. It can fit in the average pocket and is durable enough to not be a subject of constant anxiety. It doesn't scratch easily and a nice small cover is attached that will secure the lense in a snap.

I think this is a good choice for anyone who wants an easy to use, quick responding digital camera. Its not the most advanced but it is perfect for its catagory of advancement.<br><br>
