            I received my Olympus D 340R as a gift from my parents.  This was my first foray into the world of digital photography, though I had some experience with 35 mm cameras.  

The only glitch at first was that it said it was not compatible with G3(blue-box) Macintosh or iMacs. I did make it compatible by purchasing a USB adapter and now I upload images directly to my computer.  

This camera takes gorgeous pictures and is easy to use!  It takes a little time to become aquainted with all the features, of course.  It also comes with Adobe PhotoDeluxe editing software--a $50 value--which has step-by-step instructions on enhancing your pictures, making cards, etc. 

So you can make it compatible with newer Macs...don't get discouraged! 
Definitely invest in a battery charger--you will need it as it really uses up batteries.  

This is a great first-time digital camera.  <br><br>
