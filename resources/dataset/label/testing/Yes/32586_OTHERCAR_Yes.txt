            The '97 Saturn SL has been a reliable and easy first car.  I bought it from my father in early 1997 with 12,000 miles on it.  It runs beautifully despite my lack of maintenance. The car does lack a little spunk though when climbing hills and when it is full of people.  Gas mileage runs around 37-42 miles to the gallon.  Overall, I don't spend that much on maintenance or time worrying weather it will start on a cold morning.  The major setback for this vehicle is the seats.  They are uncomfortable on long trips.  The front and back seats have no lower back support.  Despite this discomfort I would probably buy another Saturn.
This is a good overall car.  Maybe a little expensive for a first car (around $12,000), but they do maintain their resale value and the used car dealerships are easy to handle because they don't haggle.  <br><br>
