            My 2000 G20 is the best car I've ever driven and owned.  And I've driven and owned many cars.  Sure there are more expensive cars that are more luxurious, and offer better performance, but for the price range that it's in, nothing matches it.  
I waited and waited to get a rare base cloth automatic model.  
It took nearly 8 months before a ship from Japan floated to the shores of Elizabeth, NJ with my car!! Born in May, 2000 in Kanagawa, Japan.  Purchased in Aug. 2000 in New York.
All professional reviewers must be idiots.  Because they all say that the cloth is not luxurious, etc.  What they really meant is that they've never actually seen and felt that cloth.  To see it and touch it is magic.  The elegant color combo of beige with swatches of light green and lavender give it an asthetic demeanor associated with traditional Japanese culture.  And this cloth feels like supple velvet. It has a deep pile.  You must be very careful so as not to make it dirty.  Believe me, it's a completely different cloth than Maxima, Altima, Camry, Accord, AND LEXUS ES300!!  The ES300 cloth was very cheap feeling and looking.  And that's a great car.
I've had no mechanical problems with this car for 3.5 years.  I do have that occasional sulfur odor that is common with this vehicle.  But it doesn't bother me and I do not trust mechanics messing with these high tech cars, even Infiniti.  Remember, nobody really cares about your car except you.
It is the most solid(tank), super handling, car I've ever had.
The power is very good as well.  The sweet sound of engine can be heard over 2000 rpm.  And it can reach 124 mph.
The SR20DE engine is a proven engine developed in the late 80's.  It has been refined to near perfection over the years.
The purr of the engine at idle is music to the ears.  A refined purr.
The hood weighs a ton(nice).  The trunk has gas shocks.  
Some complaints now:
Dashboard could have been better looking and softer.
Door plastics are too hard and cheap feeling.  
BOSE is horrible.  It's a joke.  I wish there was a Nakamichi system in there or Mark Levinson.  Bose is overrated and was good at one time.  
I wish this and all cars had DRL.  
Thecurb  weight is nearly 3000 lbs.  This compact car(slightly bigger than corolla) is a heavy chunk of steel.  
I plan to keep it for about 16-14 years.  Could be longer.
