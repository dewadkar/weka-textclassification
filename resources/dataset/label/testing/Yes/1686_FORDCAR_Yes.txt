            We bought our Excursion in October in order to have a 4-wheel drive vehicle large enough to transport four dogs and two people on a 6000 mile vacation in the Western United States.  We found the large size necessary to fit everything comfortably.  This truck helped make our trip very successful.  The front seat is comfortable.  The driver's seat is adjustable for both large and small drivers.  Although the view out the front window for a short person leaves something to be desired, as with any large vehicle.  
The drive is comfortable and the weight kept the truck on the highway even in the high wind areas while passing other vehicles.
The Excursion has some neat features that we found handy.  The side mirrors have an optional heater on the main mirror which is great to clear off the morning ice and fog.  There is a lower mirror which allows for better visibility of the cars travelling next to the truck.  Since the Excursion is so large, this is really great safety feature.
Also the back side windows can be cracked open conveniently from the front seat.  Also the truck has dual heating/air conditioning controls so the back cargo area can be controlled from the front only, or from the middle passenger seat.
Of course, the gas mileage was poor with the V-8, but better than we had anticipated.  The average was 13.5, which included some steep mountain driving.  However, with the 40 gallon gas tank we still had a good travelling range between fill-ups.
We only had to use the 4-Wheel drive once when we got into snow in the mountains.  It delivered what we expected and were not slowed down much by the bad roads.
If you a looking for a large vehicle for travelling and don't mind bad gas mileage this is a good truck.  It isn't for everyday grocery shopping.
