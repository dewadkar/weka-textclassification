            That's what I used to think, now I don't know what I would do without my 99 Chevy Venture Van. I have the short wheel base, dark green, base model Venture. Where do I start, I love the  flip and fold seats, I was even able to remove one of them when I was about 8 months pregnant, they are easy to use and convenient for hauling. With three kids all the cup holders really come in handy as well as all the little extra cargo spaces.
It rides like a car and maneuvers very nicely in tight spaces. BUT, my favorite feature has to be the power sliding door! When my arms are full, which they are most of the time, I just click a button and presto it's open. It is a great safety feature too, when I have the kids with me I just get them all in first and then jump in myself close the door and then put them in their carseats. I can't say enough about it!

Only bad thing is when you order the base model, you cannot get the integrated (built in) child car seats.<br><br>
