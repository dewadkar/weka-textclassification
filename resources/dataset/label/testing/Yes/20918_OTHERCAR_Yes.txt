            First I have to admit that I haven't bought it yet, and I am debating it still.  I have taken a test drive and enjoyed the ride.  The thing I liked most about this vehicle was the four doors, the space, the fuel economy, the appearance and the comfort compared to a minivan(which is what I will buy if I don't get a Cruiser).  I want a larger vehicle without going broke or having too much air space.

The minute I saw a review of the Cruiser one year ago, I knew I wanted one.  But taking the test drive has confirmed it.  Now what is holding me back is waiting for the first year to go through.  I'd like to hear what recalls are made, and talk to people who have driven them for a while.  

Will the comfort and affordability last through the first year or so?  Will there be any &quot;bugs&quot; in the systems of them.  That is what I am waiting to find out about.

So long as my first impression, and the first impression of many others holds true, I'll be looking at a purchase agreement in the new year.
