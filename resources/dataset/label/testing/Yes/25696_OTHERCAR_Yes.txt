            While the models that Nissan released in late 1995 and beyond are garnering well-deserved praise, the 1995 Pathfinder is a worthy choice for your used SUV dollar. The last of the venerated, do I dare say &quot;classic&quot;, design that spanned nearly a decade, was discontinued with this model. Nissan retooled the Pathfinder assembly line to produce a kinder, gentler model which appealed to a new set of buyers while retaining enough characteristics to say &quot;I'm Still a Pathfinder&quot;. But there continues to be supporters of the more &quot;utility&quot; squared-off style which is the distinct look of the '95 Pathfinder. Competing models characterized by Jeep (not Grand) Cherokee and Wrangler still offer this look which many find rugged, masculine and no-nonsense.

One of the Pathfinder's most reliable years according to &quot;Consumer's&quot;, it is apparent that Nissan had continued to tweak, if not overhaul, the lineage up to 1995. The model tested is a V6 XE. Although not the high-end SE model, this 4-wheel drive was decked out with AC, leather, power windows, rear window defrost/wiper, swing away spare tire holder and roof rack.

Reliability has proven to be excellent with no major trouble. Fit and finish is superb and the paint and interior still appear new when given a once over. The ride on the highway and city streets is car like. Off-road and in the snow, the feel of the vehicle is substantial but not ploddingly so. Serious off-roaders should consider stiffening the suspension. Engine performance is not the vehicle's strong point. The 150 horsepower fuel injected V6 seems to strain on quick acceleration. It winds up RPM with impressive noise and shifts cleanly but the speedometer moves all too slowly to 65. Jack rabbit starts, however, is not what an SUV is all about and, in fairness, the acceleration is adequate.

All controls are smartly laid out except for the cruise control switch which is hidden in an obscure portion of the dash and the rear window release which is located on the central console. This switch is something I've only used maybe twice in five years so that's just a nit pick. Passenger room is adequate front and back. Unfortunately, air bags became standard with Pathfinder's next release. Rear passengers have the benefit of a raised seat which gives them a good view over the front passenger shoulders. When the rear seats are folded down, a surprisingly large cargo area is available. When loading cargo, I have received many comments on the roominess of the Pathfinder.

I expect several more years of service from what has been well-built and reliable truck. This is the SUV to consider for those who want and expect much more than average from a used SUV.<br><br>
