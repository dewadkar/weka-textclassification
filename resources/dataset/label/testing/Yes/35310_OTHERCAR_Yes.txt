            I received this camera as a Christmas present last year, so I am not certain of the price.  However, as far as cameras go, this is a great one!

The QV 7000 sx is a great camera, and it has many helpful features.

Some of these features include: 

* a turn around lens, to help you take pictures from any angle
* an lcd screen, about 2 by 3 inches
* camera strap
* digital 4 X zoom
* qv-link program, to upload pictures with
* great resolution
* memory card fits lots of pictures

however, there are a few down sides to this camera.

* does not include AC adaptor
* LCD screen wears out batteries quickly
* have to upload through cable

However, this is a great camera.  I would recomend it to anyone.<br><br>
