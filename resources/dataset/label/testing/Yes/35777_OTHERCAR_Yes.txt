            Before buying this car ('03 EX w/leather, 4-cyl auto), I test-drove same-class cars like the Camry and Altima and just to know what i'd be missing, an Acura TL.

From a technology/engineering perspective, the Accord is ahead of the Camry and Altima due to its 5-speed auto transmission (others have 4) and 4-link suspension front and rear suspension (others: front struts and rear links).  Against the previous generation engine, the new one is more powerful yet more economical and has interesting innovations that will delight a gearhead.  The Altima has a more powerful 4-banger however.

As to "customer-delighting" features, the car also leads because of unique features like: remote window-down operation from the key fob (key fob has the door lock/trunk opener and panic mode built in), door pockets shaped to secure a water bottle, outstanding dashboard design and materials (the Camry's straight-across design looks 60s, and the Altima's is unfortunately out of this league in design, materials and execution), rear-located dome light (so rear passengers can use light without bothering driver), an amber-colored light (coming out from the map light cluster overhead) that softly illuminates the shift area for ambient lighting, and dual-zone hvac (on EX-leather and V6).  Professional reviewers, whom I agree with, rate this car's seats as best in class.

On the subjective area of style, from afar and up-close the car while not a visual stunner looks more elegant, substantial and expensive than either the Camry or Altima.  For those who want sportiness, Altima wins (especially in black in my opinion).  The camry has a nicer side-window profile but otherwise looks too upright when viewed directly from behind.

How does the car drive compared with its rivals ?  It's almost as lively as the altima but quieter.  It's not as quiet but is more responsive than the Camry.  The ride is German-like: firm but comfortable, controlled, and never clunky.  If it was as isolated as the Camry, maybe for some people it would be ideal but Honda apparently promotes a man-and- machine relationship through low-intensity noises and vibration.  

Myself driving a Toyota Camry Solara (the '03 Accord is my wife's), I can say that after a rough day at work, the Camry is a nice soothing escape.  The Accord, on the other hand, may not provide that but will definitely offer more fun.  

Oh yeah, while the Acura TL is upscale, it shows its previous-generation heritage (it's based on the 98-02 accord) through its dash design and somewhat smaller-feeling interior space.  Also, after buying the Accord, I visited a Mazda dealer to see their new Mazda 6 - while it has a sportier exterior, the interior is smaller, designed less thoughtfully and has a notch-lower quality.
