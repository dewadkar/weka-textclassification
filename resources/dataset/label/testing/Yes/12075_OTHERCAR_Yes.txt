            I purchased this truck strictly for delivery purposes. I deliver envelopes and boxes 55+ hours per week. Minimal break-downs, low cost maintenance, and fuel economy all were critical factors. I've owned the truck for 11 months.  Bought with 135k, currently 185k.  I've put probably $1,500 into it mechanically during this time. Tires, brakes, radio, wheel cover, oil changes, front u-joint. The major repair and only break-down was at 150k when the timing chain busted and caused engine damage. Cost was $750. I was told the truck needs a new timing CHAIN every 100k. I get 23 to 25 mpg in my combination city/hwy, even with aggressive driving, lead footing the 4-cyl motor. I find it to have just the right amount of power for a blend of economy and performance. My truck will carry 1,200 pounds {have put 1,400+ LB in it}. It does have a tendency to sway empty or full although mechanics don't find front end trouble. Currently the truck has developed rear end noise, and as it is closing in on 200k and will soon need repeat maintenance, I will probably retire it soon. I only paid $2,000 for it, during which time I have earned 20 times that amount, making it a spectacular value.

UPDATE: 11-19-00

     The &quot;sway&quot; turned out to just be low tire pressure.  The rear end noise was somewhat helped by changing the rear end gear oil for the first time at 197k. I now have 202k on the truck, put new skins on it, and have continued to get low cost operation. I figure I can get another 60k from it, and if I do, who cares what I could sell it for; it will have served it's purpose beautifully.

UPDATE: 12-23-00

 I decided to sell the truck. A local couple purchased it yesterday for $2,150. It had 204k miles. They were giving it as a surprise x-mas present to a well respected teacher-co-worker.  In essence the cost of my ownership due to repairs and add-ons (shell &amp; CD) was about $1,850/70k driven =2.6 cents per mile + gas and oil. Top that!
