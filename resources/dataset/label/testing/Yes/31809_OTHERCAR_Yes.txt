            Let me start off by saying that my 2000 Civic LX is my third Honda, so that tells you how much I trust the Honda name.  As soon as I drove this car off the lot, I felt comfortable in it.  The car has great fuel economy, it looks great, the interior placement of knobs and buttons is perfectly placed, and the clutch is one of the easiest to use compared to other vehicles I've driven.The Civic, even though a four-door is still sleek and sporty looking, the trunk is bigger than the one on my 1990 Accord, and the interior is just as big as some mid-sized vehicles.  Also, speaking from a mechanical point of view, the car is perfect for do-it-yourself oil and air filter changers.The only downside I've found (which may not even be a downside since I had an expensive radio, amplifiers, and speakers in my old car) is I think the radio could sound a little better.  On the same subject, the Civic has a rear-window integrated antenna, which picks up signals even under bridges and power lines, and there's no need to push down your antenna or turn off the radio while washing your car.All in all, the Civic is great looking, great on gas, and the placement of the interior components is perfect for ease of use.  I highly recommend this vehicle to everyone whether or not they are on a budget.  I'll definately buy another when this lease is up!  <br><br>
