            This has to be one of the best made cars ever! My Camry is a DX Green Coupe with 67,000 miles.  The DX is the lower model, but it has an AWSOME 5-speed transmission that wasn't offered in the higher trim levels.  I bought my car in October 2003, and it was owned by obsessive compulsive women, so everything is perfect in the car.  I've never met the former owner, but when you look at an owner's manual that was underlined at every maintenance and warning, you can figure it out real fast.  This car is one of the best riding cars I have ever been in; it handles much better than my grandparents 45,000 Caddy.  The transmission shifts so smooth just like it came off the assembly line.  The coupe is great since its kind-of rare compared to the sedans and wagons.  The backseat has great leg room and access back there is very easy to get into.  The mileage with the 5-speed is AMAZING I was able to get 36 MPG on a trip to Boston with four people and their luggage.  In the middle of a New England winter I KNOW my Camry will start up no matter what.

Cons: They are pretty petty but here goes.
Since I have to park my car outside, anytime it gets below freezing my locks freeze up.  It&#146s not that big of a deal, just a little deicer and there fine.  It&#146s just a nucence every morning having to deice them.  In the Camry DX the stereo is pretty weak, when I bought my car the front speakers were blown and only one speaker in the back worked.  The dealer where I bought my car was very helpful and ended up paying for half of the cost to get replacements (which are huge step up).  When they took the old speakers out the drivers one was rusted through.  I have no idea how this could have happened since the car doesn&#146t have any leaks.

I would recommend anyone to get this car, I am so happy that Toyota's are so dependable.  I can't wait till my odometer hits 200,000.  I know that I will stay in the Toyota family for a very long time.  Their cars are second to none.
