            I have had my Neon for a year now and for the price it has been well worth it.  This is definitely an economy car, no luxury features to brag about, but it gets me around without any worries.  If all you're looking for is an inexpensive, reliable car, then this is the one.

The best part about the Neon, aside from the price, is its roominess.  I previously had a Mitsubishi Eclipse, but needed to buy something more reliable and with a bigger back seat as I was about to have baby and the car seat wouldn't fit in the Eclipse.  The Neon has plenty of leg room, front and back.  However, I should point out that trunk space is very limited.  The back seats fold down allowing you access from the trunk, but even with this feature, its a tight squeeze for hauling around anything larger than a suitcase.

The seats of very comfortable.  I have trouble with lower back pain and these seats don't bother me at all, even on long road trips.  Also, the car always starts without hesitation, even in extremely cold temperatures (I live in Minnesota).  It heats up in hardly no time at all.

The seal on my passenger window isn't tight which can be very annoying driving down the freeway on a windy day.  On than that, there's not much to complain about.  The gas mileage is very good at about 30 miles per gallon.  There isn't a lot of power to the engine, but its not bad and handles high speeds just fine.  All in all, the price makes this car a very good value.<br><br>
