            I bought my 2003 Jeep Wrangler X on November 11th, 2002. I have the soft top and full-size metal doors with glass windows. It's been a little over a year now and it has grown on me. I don't really have a good reason for choosing a Jeep. I traded in my Mustang GT and F-250 for it because I was living on my own by myself and I didn't see it necessary to pay two car payments, insurance, maintenance, et cetera. My interest in a Jeep was suddenly sparked one day and I went with the urge. Almost getting stuck in the mud with my two-wheel drive F-250 probably helped with my decision...

I love the classic styling of the Wrangler. I also love the ability to change the vehicle whenever I want to, like removing the doors, folding down the top, and removing the rear seat - all without having to use tools, except for the "removing the doors" part. The backseat is not a big pain in the neck to remove; I was able to remove AND carry it inside my apartment with one hand without dragging it. The windshield washing fluid reservoir has a pretty large capacity. I use the fluid quite often and it took me about 11 months to run out of it! Due to the Wrangler's relatively small size, it is very easy to park and maneuver around things - quite helpful in the parking lot from Hell where I work. In case you get a little wild off road or your pet has an accident in a Wrangler, the interior carpeting can be removed in sections to be cleaned and I was told by the dealership that you can safely wash each piece in a regular clothes washer. I have not tried this personally, so I won't recommend it here. I'm very pleased that the Jeep Wrangler has enough room for tall people. I'm 6'2", 230 lbs. and I can still wear a fedora without it touching the roof.

What I don't like about the Wrangler is the fuel economy. I have over 12,000 miles on my Jeep and the best mileage I've recorded so far was only 19 mpg. I also don't like the quality of sound that comes out of the speakers. It's not horrible, but if you listen to anything that has too much bass, the speakers rattle under pressure. Even Howard Stern's voice can make the speakers sound a little cheap if you have the bass turned up too high. I have learned to leave the bass at the middle setting. I know I only have the "X" trim, but it would have been nice for Jeep to have a CD player with the radio rather than just having a cassette player. There is hardly any space behind the back seat for groceries, but if you only have one passenger with you, it's not bad since the backseat folds and tumbles forward.

To sum it up, the Jeep Wrangler is a reliable and affordable 4x4. It doesn't feel as top-heavy as you might think as you drive around corners and it is perfectly capable on or off the road. It's also nice knowing that Wranglers hold their resale value quite well.
