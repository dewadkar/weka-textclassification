                 I am a totally electronically challenged person.  I choose this camera because it seemed dummy proof and
not so costly for a beginner.

not recommend the low resolution setting even though it stores more pictures. You can also run it as a video
camera, for about 10 seconds worth of time.
     The users manual is on the software and is very helpful.  It gives all the information that the enclosed
instructions doesn't.  I suggest you read through the users guide before you use the camera.  I am a great
one for when all else fails, "Read The Instructions". Funny how reading them usually makes operations a lot
easier.
