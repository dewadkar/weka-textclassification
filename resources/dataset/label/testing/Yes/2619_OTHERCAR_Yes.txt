                 I love my 1995.5 Passport.  This is a non technical review.  My Passport is so comfortable, and spacious.  There is plenty of room in the back for hauling groceries, or I've even hauled sod!  I love being up so high where I can see what's going on in traffic situations and speed bumps are no problem!  I love the feeling of power as I take off into traffic, it gets to the speed limit in seconds! This SUV has 4 doors making it a snap to load and unload my daughter and neice in their car seats.  Both of the back doors have child safety locks.  My best friend even went out and bought one after riding around in mine.

     I bought my passport used and know the previous owner.  I bought it knowing that it had been wrecked and rebuilt, because I was able to get it for only $8,500.  I wouldn't say that it's a good idea to buy wrecked cars, but in our case we also know the man who made all the repairs, and felt that we were getting a heck of a deal.  The 1995.5 model has a tire on the back on a rim that you can throw on in place of a blown tire and still all wheels will match!!  I wouldn't trade my SUV for any regular car.  I advise if you do decide to get a SUV to always drive safely and avoid taking corners to fast.  Also, just as a reminder, If you plan to drink, plan to let someone else get you home safely, because it's so hard to enjoy new cars and other things in life, when you no longer have a life.  Thanks for reading my review.
