            I've wanted a BMW car ever since I sold the BMW bike. Weather, traffic, and geography conspired to push me to sell the bike. In it's place, however, we put a used 1995 325i 4-door. New baby required the 4-doors, my wife required something with ABS, traction control and airbags, and I required the larger (over the 1.8L) 2.5L motor with 5-speed.

We're utilitarian, used-car people. We've both always had older Japanese econo-boxes. So when I suggested that we get into a BMW, my wife was reluctant to spend the money. But research found that a mid-90's BMW was only a few $1000 more than a mid-90's V6 Camry, V6 Maxima, or VW Passat.

And it's easily $100,000 more fun to drive.

The handling is unparalleled. The finish is so much nicer, the seats more comfortable, and the 2.5L inline six makes power a-plenty from 2,000 RPM all the way to redline. This car has satisfied my moto-lust and unleashed the driver enthusiast in my wife. The ABS and traction control have made it completely manageable in the January 2000 blizzard. The weight and rear-wheel-drive make a little more squirrelly in the snow than our front-wheel-drive Toyota Corolla, but its a minor adjustment in driving technique and we get so little snow and ice here that it's hardly an issue. And the other 50 weeks/year are well worth it.

And it passed the Mariette test. Mariette is my diminutive Swedish mother-in-law. She's a sweet, gentle woman and deathly afraid of freeway travel. Recently we drove the dreaded I-95 corridor from DC to Richmond, with Mariette in the back seat. We had timed entry tickets to an art exhibit and were delayed by road construction in Springfield. The only way to meet our ticket schedule was to steam along at 90-95 MPH, weaving among the bloated SUV's and big rigs. All the while Mariette sat in the back seat reading Architectural Digest and enjoying Beethoven on the CD player. This car is so stable that she never noticed the speed or aggressive style with which I was driving.

Even at 4 years old with 75K on the odometer, this feels like a new car.<br><br>
