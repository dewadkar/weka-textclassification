            The 1996 Ford Explorer has been extremely good to me. It is a very comfortable vehicle for long trips, very spacious, and offers a smooth ride. The back seat folds down for those larger than average items. The back door opens which really comes in handy when you have an infant on your hands. It is spacious enough for hauling along playpens, diaper bags, and all those other baby necessities. I have never had a problem with this vehicle. Its great on gas mileage. Has dual airbags. And a perfect size back seat for a Carrier. It is the ideal size for a small person or large person who likes SUVS. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. <br><br>
