            Legacy of Jeep

The 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee appears to carry on the tradition of Jeep vehicles present for so many years.  The new JGC has been in production in this incarnation for a little over a year now.  The new model teething problems so common in the 1999 Grand seem to have been resolved.  The transfer case shudder has been solved thru modification to the lubricant. The axle noises have been address via new procedure and production changes.  

Now for performance, if you need a comfortable, reliable, off-road worthy
sport utility vehicle, with seating for 5, adequate cargo capacity and the $30,000.00 plus price is no object, then this may be the vehicle for you.

If you are a hard-core off-roader, then the Jeep Wrangler may fit you needs better. It's a tougher, more light footed vehicle, designed for serious off road.

The 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee provides comfort, performance and image at a upper-mid level price.  Like the adds say &quot;Jeep, theres no substitute.&quot;<br><br>
