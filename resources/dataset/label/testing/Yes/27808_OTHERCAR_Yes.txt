            I got this camera for graduation in December of 2000. Since then I've taken about 13,000 pictures (http://staffpages.smu.edu/ben/galleries.asp). That's some pretty heavy use.

It's in my pocket 90% of the time wherever I go. I got some sand in it at the beach, but it recovered well.

The only major problem that I had was the CF media door broke and I had to use a rubber band to hold it on so it would function. Replacing that cost about $15 from canon for a little piece of plastic. 

I've also noticed that the little screws that hold the aluminum cover on have been falling out. I'm going to need to find some more of those.

There are very few options on the camera and they are all very easy to use. The flash has a button for flash modes, there is a distance mode for close and far things and one menu for taking a series of pictures, just one, or having a timer. In a more in-depth menu, you can choose color or black and white and the picture quality. There are enough options for daily use, but more would make it more fun for us geeks.

The picture quality and colors are remarkable for such a small lens. There is a noticable difference between its picture quality and other, larger lensed cameras, but they are slight and can only be seen when compared side by side.

The portability means that I've gotten pictures that other people who need neck straps never would get. That's priceless.
