            I have an S60 2.4T AWD with every option possible. I have been driving this car constantly since I bought it four months ago, and have enjoyed every second. 

Exterior - That's a Volvo? is the question that I usually receive regarding the exterior styling on this car. My answer is Volvo has come a long long way. This car has a very refined and elegant look to it, flowing lines, great tail lights, and a full look with the optional 17' rims. This car does not look quite right without the 17's, I would definitely recommend getting them. Everything on the outside of the car just seems to fit the overall look, all in all, what's not to like?

Interior - I have the warm and cold weather, touring and premium packages, with the navigational system. The seats are incredible. Both of the front seats are leather, power adjusted, and heated. I drove the mercedes E class and the BMW 5 and neither had more comfortable seats. The instrument panel is easy to look at and everything is laid out in such a way that it makes perfect sense. The Auto climate control is well laid out as well, with the diagram of a person for the different zones. The sound system is really quite amazing. I have the 200 watt system, and it really does sound like an aftermarket system with subs. The visual presentation is very nice, my car has wood inlays for almost all of the interior surfaces that are not leather, and it looks great. I do have two small gripes, the first of which is the leg room situation in the back. I am a tall person, 6'5, and there is just not enough room in the back unless the front seats are positioned almost all of the way forward. It is just right for people of medium height, though. Secondly, the retractable door in between the seats that covers the drink holders is poor engineering and manufacturing. It broke after 1 month and is the only service I have had to perform. The dealer said that it is not a complaint he hears often so maybe it was just my car.

Performance - I have the 197 hp light turbo engine. This is the category that could use a little work. The 197 hp engine is substantial and provides for a rather quick acceleration, with a very noticeable turbo lag. I wonder why they did not offer the AWD system with the larger 247 hp engine that the T5 uses. The brakes are top notch, not too soft, not too hard. The AWD system is phenominal. I had a great opportunity to use it the other day, I live in Colorado, and we got two feet of snow the other day. Quite honestly the volvo handled itself remarkably, almost better than my grand cherokee. The Dynamic Stability and traction control system was lighting up quite a bit, but it was never obtrusive. All in all the power is right whee it should be for everything that you need to do, but a little more would be nice for the price. I did start in Boulder and set the cruise control at 90 on the way up to Vail the other day and even going up a steep hill at 10,000 feet it did not falter for a second.

I would strongly recommend this vehicle to anyone as a very viable alternative to its German counterparts.
