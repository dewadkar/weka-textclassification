                Do not take this the wrong way. The Dodge 2500, quad cab, is an excellent vehicle. I have the diesel model with the 8 foot bed. However, there are a couple of equipment issues I must advise present and potential owners of.
    First is the anti-lock brakes. Over the last year that I have drove this truck, I have noticed times when the brakes react strangely. When approaching a stop, if you roll over a bump while the brakes are applied, they will lock. This causes the rear wheels to slide on the pavement. It makes no difference if the road surface is wet or dry. If it is wet, the truck only slides furthur.
    The greater your speed, the longer the slide. Now you still have control of the front wheels, so, you are able to control the direction of the slide, somewhat. This occurence is dangerous if you are preparing to stop and there is vehicles in front of you. Also, it can cause you to slide past an attempted left or right turn.
    Second is the problem I have had with the top latch of the rear doors. They are head bangers. These babies stick out from the top of the truck about one and a half inch. There have been many times I and other people that are getting in or out of the back seat have struck these things with our head. Believe me it hurts, it leaves a large knot, and it will leave you dazed for a while if you hit it hard enough.
    I have thought of wrapping them with something to soften the blow. I have considered painting them a bright color so they can be seen and noticed. But, neither of these applications would last because of the constant latching of the door. Instead I just try and warn everyone of their being there. 
    I have plans to contact the NTSB and Dodge about these concerns and see if they have received any complaints about them. Please do not let these items detour anyone from purchasing a Dodge Quad Cab. <br><br>
