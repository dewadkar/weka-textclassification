            We purchased our Honda Passport in June of 1999. It has been more than a year without any problems. I read some opinions about Rodeo being cheaper, but I think that Honda Passport is a very reasonably priced SUV. We shopped around and made comparisons with Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Isuzu and we decided to buy the Passport. Because the selection at the Isuzu dealer was very limited. We purchased our SUV for about $22,300 base price. We have a 2WD, 4DR Passport. I think this price is very compatible with the Isuzu Rodeo. We liked our SUV because the spare tire is underneath the car and not on the back door. Just like the Isuzu Rodeo we had a anti-theft program already included in the price of the SUV. Our black Passport has gold colored logos and writings on it which was $500 extra. We managed to get that included free in the purchase price. Negotiating with the dealer was very easy. We were so happy with the purchase price that we also bought a LoJack anti-theft device. We love the power of the engine and the comfort of the interior. It is a very practical SUV with many useful features. Such as large cargo space and removable cover for the inside the trunk. Automatic driver side door unlocks all other doors and the driver side automatic window rolls all the way down without holding the button continuously.
We were disappointed with the gas mileage which is around 18MPG in the city and 20MPG on the highway. Yet a large gas tank is very useful. Two recalls so far made us little nervous.
Overall we are very happy with the choice we made.<br><br>
