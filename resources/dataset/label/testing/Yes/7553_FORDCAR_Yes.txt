            My first Ford Expedition (XP)Eddie Bauer was a '98. It was  a upgrade from a '94 Explorer.
I changed mainly for size. I acquired a dog and started camping again.
It was big! I want for all the option available, 18' wheels, tow package, load level, ect. But no heated seats! &lt;I ended up trading it in for a '99 was I found out they had heated seats!&gt;
Great truck, awesome turning radius; I can park that thing like a Miata!, park it anywhere as it Navigates :-) parking lots stalls better than most cars.
Roomy, seat 4 very comfortably with gear.
Powerful, but the 40 HP increase in 99 is a Godsend!
The best feature of the truck is the Numeric Entry Pad on the door!
Not having to bring your keys with you when you go snowboarding for the day is awesome! Just hide them some where in the truck and leave. This is cool as long as you can remember you entry code. It also good for those members of your group who cannot make it for the whole day, and want to, just hang out on the car.<br><br>
