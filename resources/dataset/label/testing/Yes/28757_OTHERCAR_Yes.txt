            Honda has made a sure winner with this car.  It makes me cry to see this car drive by me because I wish I owned it.  This is by far one of the best values for a sports car that can be found anywhere.  This car is guaranteed chick magnet.  It is the coolest looking car that is out on the market right now.  I test drove this car and it�s competition like the Acura Integra and definitely though this car was much better.  The V-tech system that is in really lets the car zoom.  I burned so many people with it that I lost track.  I love this car and wouldn�t have any other one in it�s place.  I personally like the stick shift better than the manual.  The 200 horsepower is great for a car that small at pack a big punch.  The seats are very comfortable.  Also no need for a system to be added because this car comes with a big boom in it.  This is one most complete car that I have rode in.<br><br>
