            I bought a New Jetta in May 1999. I shopped around for a long time trying to find the perfect &quot;different&quot; car. I bought a loaded New Jetta with leather, sunroof, and auto transmission. I couldn't have made a better choice.

The car has lived up to be everything I had hoped for. It doesn't drive like a Toyota or Honda but more like a Mercedes or BMW. It is very tight and responsive. Compared to other cars in its price range there is nothing even close. I paid $21,000 for it and its worth every penny. I look at it as a luxury car at a non-luxury price.

I guess the only thing that I didn't fall in love with was the fact that when you buy a Volkswagen, you pretty much pay what the sticker says. In my area there are only three dealers within a 200 mile radius. After research I found that they do not get all the factory kickbacks like the other dealers. Instead, the factory gives incentives based on customer feedback and service. If you buy a Volkswagen you will be amazed at how they go out of their way to make you happy. Every time you bring your car for service, (oil changes free for a year) the Volkswagen factory (not the dealer) calls you at home and you have to rate the service etc. This information is collected and determines the dealer's compensation. In my opinion this is the best way to give excellent service.

I can tell you that Volkswagen's are now my car of choice and I feel that probably every other owner feels the same way.<br><br>
