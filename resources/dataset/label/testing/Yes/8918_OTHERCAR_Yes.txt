            The Dodge grand caravan provides room for 7 people and lots of cargo. You can take out the back and middle seats to fit even more cargo(this is very easy to do just a flip of a levar). It comes with a good soundsystem with 2 sub woofers and suround sound speakers in key points throughout the van. It also has the best heating and cooling system in any automoble ive ever seen. It has vents in the front,back,side,bottom and side of them car so it can be very quickly cooled or heated up.  The cars front wheel disc brakes and ABS provide very quick stops in varied rode condtions. The cars power steering and syspension make it surprisingly nimble for a van. It has both driver and passenger side air bags for the maxium level safty. The only thing that can be difficult with the Dodge Grande Caravan is backing up,because it has limeted visablity that is only made worse at night with tinted windows. The dodge Grand caravan is a must for anyone who has a family or carries a lot of cargo.<br><br>
