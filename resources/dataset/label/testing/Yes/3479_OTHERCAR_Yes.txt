            Hi 

I just got back from a very exciting drive with the all new Subaru Outback six cylinder, this was with the surprisingly smooth all new L.L.Bean H6-3.0 model. At this time the H6-3.0 VDC, the one with the traction control and 11 speaker 200 amp Stereo was not yet available for my driving pleasure.

 This all-new Outback H6-3.0 L.L.Bean Edition has 212 horsepower with four-speed automatic transmission It is hard to belive yet for this really quick and quiet vehicle with the six cylinder engine is EPA rated to deliver 20 Miles Per Gallon City and 27 Per Gallon Highway, only 1 Mile Per Gallon less than the 4 Cylinder Outback, a small price to pay for the substantial improvement in power.

 I really like this wagon a lot as it has far more comfortable seats and is so much smoother. While also having a level of conviences such as the Climate Control, exceptional sound system, etc. found in cars costing much more. Yet retaining the reliability and safety found in few other cars. 

 I expect that this Subaru will provide the same secure feeling driving in slipperly or difficult conditions as well as my 1995 Subaru Legacy Wagon. Which will plow snow when it gets nasty out. 

 So if you are looking for a really nice comfortable station wagon that is swift and sure footed then this is it. Or if you are looking for a very well equipped luxury wagon this is it as well. All in one very nice package. Even the paint colors are nice. 

 If you already enjoy the driving pleasures of an earlier Subaru then stay away as driving this car will spoil the fun you are now having. Subaru Does it Again. 

What's next? Well I am anticipating another very exciting drive when the Subaru Outback VDC with traction control is available for a test drive.  

Thank you Kris
