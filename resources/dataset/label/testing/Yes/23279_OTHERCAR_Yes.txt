            I bought this car because of its looks and deal
I never thought I could afford a car, for real

I'm a teenager with not much money or cash
But I could pick up a car that is much better than most kids trash

Looks are important I most admit to you
But so is that important thing called reliability too

This car has both and much much more
In my opinion it gets a perfect 10 as a score

I chose black because it looked sweet
and the 10 year warranty, man what a treat

Ok there might be some flaws which I will share.
It's only v4, but I don't really care.

For having such a small engine it sure accelerates fast.
My dad wouldn't like to hear this, but driving it at over 80 is a blast

Gas mileage is always a factor when buying
At 27mpg, it's great, I ain't lying

Go to your local Hyundai shop
Just make one stop

Test drive the Elantra and I'm sure you'll agree 
The Hyundai Elantra is a best buy, just wait and see
