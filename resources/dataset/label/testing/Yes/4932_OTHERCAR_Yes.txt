            Our Sonoma is falling apart.  We were going in the mountains with it (it has 4x4) and the tailgate kept falling open.  We tried to wire it shut, but it fell right through our rigging.
The locks on both sides are hell trying to get up and down, so we don't even lock it anymore.  The headlights were really loose and it seemed as though they were going to fall off where ever we were driving.
The tie rods had to be replaced when it only had 1500 miles on it.  The shocks had to be replaced in the back at 2000 mile.  The motor mount on the passenger side was broken when we drove it off the lot brand new.
The stereo is falling inside the dash board, but it sounds great, with our amp and subs.  The glove box has to be slammed to be closed.  My little sister can't close it at all, it's so hard to close.
We got bigger tires for it and didn't get mud flaps, which was a big mistake with the cheap paint.  After a trip to California, the paint was chipped where the bugs hit it.  The driver's door and back window leak.  That makes the seats wet and uncomfortable.  The auto transmission shifts really hard from first to second and it's scary.

The people at the GMC dealer (Michael Hohl's Motor Company) didn't honor the factory warranty and kept the truck all day without doing anything except writing down what was wrong with it.  Then we took it to Winkle Poniac, GMC in Reno and they fixed everything with no charge because it was under warranty.

The good things about it are it looks hella cool.  We have &quot;Barbie&quot; stripes on it that I didn't like at first but now think it would look tacky without.
The bedliner is real easy to clean and can take a hell of a beating.  The shocks, after being replaced, provided a really smooth ride.  The push-button four wheel drive is nice, because I'm dumb and don't know how to use a manual one.  It climbs hills WAY better than other little trucks that I've seen and driven.
It has a CD player and shakes the cab.  The windows are surprisingly easy to roll up and down.  It accelerates really fast and can go 100 mph easily, not that I would know, or anything...
The windows are big so I can hang out the passenger side and yell at people.  The tint makes it look like a kid's truck (I'm a kid) instead of an old man's truck.  The big tires make it look way better than the stock Sonomas.  I like the anti-lock brakes, sometimes.  They're good when I have to stop in the snow or rain, but bad when I want to play around in the streets with my truck.
The seatbelts are comfortable and don't lock in one position during the whole trip.  The handles are in perfect spots and the controls are easy to use and easy to reach.  It gets great gas mileage and doesn't need very much work.<br><br>
