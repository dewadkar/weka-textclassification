            I am reviewing the A5 Zoom. It is a spectacular camera. It takes phenomenal outdoor shots, especially with its high resolution setting. It low resolution setting is good also if you want to take many shots. It only has two downsides that are easily fixed. The first is the battery. It takes very expensive batteries that only last an hour. However, you can buy a complete charging kit with a rechargeable battery (Model number DK111) for only $99. The other is data transfer from the camera to the PC. All that is included is a very slow Parallel cord. That is easily fixed with a Compact Flash Card reader which can be purchased for anywhere from $25 to $50. Overall, a great product.
