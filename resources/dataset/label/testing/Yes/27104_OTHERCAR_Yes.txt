            I purchased this 1992 turbo model used, about one year old with less than 15k miles. The previous owner had been an engineering type who had maintained it well. He was selling the car because his teenage son had just gotten his driving license.

My car was red with a black cloth interior, and I believe it came fully equipped. Other than adding a nice Sony stereo, I didn't modify the car at all.

I have owned a fair number of sports cars and motorcycles over the years, including three Maserati Biturbos (don't ask!), one Ferrari 348TS (see my other reviews), and currently a Yamaha VMAX. Of all my vehicles, the MR2 offered the most for the money. Handling, performance, comfort, economy, and style are all excellent and of course, Toyota reliability is included as well.

I only drove my MR2 for a couple of years, because I bought the 348 and decided that it was silly to keep both. What a mistake! 

I would compare them in this way. The Ferrari is like the hot babe of your dreams that moves in with you before you know her very well. Then one day you come home from work to find her passed out on your living room floor with two strange men and pile of empty booze bottles, having partied all night with the money she stole from your checking account.

The Toyota is the girl you meet at work who is very pretty, professional and modest, yet when you are alone together she does things for you that you never seem to tire of. Definitely a keeper that you can introduce to your parents.

My only quibble is a minor one. Having driven more powerful naturally aspirated cars, and the twin turbo Maseratis, I did find a bit of lag when stomping on the throttle. Once up to steam however, the Turbo is mighty quick, more than enough to satisfy.

Point by point, here are the main benefits:

Handling is excellent.

The engine is smooth, quiet and powerful.

Reliability excellent, no problems whatsoever.

Paint excellent.

Interior quality and ergonomics excellent.

Fuel economy surprisingly good.

There are only two drawbacks that I can recall. The first is the lack of storage space. The MR2 can never be a primary car unless you are a city dweller who has everything you need delivered. The rear trunk is hardly big enough for two bags of groceries.

The second drawback is a little more awkward. As much as I hate to admit it, the MR2 is a bit of a chick car. It just doesn't have the masculine proportions of other sports cars, and this led to a little gentle ribbing from the guys at the office. At least the 1992 model is an improvement over the previous generations. That one I believe could not legally be sold to men.

Still, in light of all the good points that the car has I highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who are secure in their manhood. On every other point, including value, the Toyota runs away from the competition.
