            About a year ago I rented a Hyundai Sonata from Avis and really was surprized that I liked it!  I needed a "mileage car" for driving to and from work and doing errands.  In the past I've had a '91 Tempo and an '84 Reliant for this use (always wanted used unpopular cars because they're cheap).  Until that rental, my only experience w/ Korean cars was my brother's JUNK Pontiac (Daewoo) LeMans that he bought new.

I bought it with 62k and now have 80k.  It usually is used in the city, but has also had a few long road trips from 4 to 14 hours each way.  

I'm 5'11.75" and in the mid 250 lb range and have no problem entering/exiting the vehicle.  The belts constantly get caught in the door - to the point that the passenger door needs slamming to close properly.  My drivers window sometimes needs a nudge to reach the top - especially in 0 degree F weather.  Oh, and don't use the A/C and drive simultanously.  But I only paid $1500 and so far have 18,000 breakdown free miles.  It doesn't get cheaper than that!

The car looks like a sport car, but the rear seating area is larger than on my Tempo.

If you're looking for a cute, dependable, economical car with no amenities, you'll luv your Scoupe, too.
