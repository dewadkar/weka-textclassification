            This is the 1st digital camera I have owned. I have had it for 3 days now. When you first look at it, you think, what can this really do? When you look at the manual you may freak out at how thick it is. In actuality, it is user friendly! A great manual; very detailed. The LCD screen is easy to look at and very true to the colors. The menu took a bit of looking back at the manual, but overall is easy to use. The images are spectacular. The digital-tele is a wonderful feature allowing you to zoom in even further on your subject than the lens. Dont like the pic? Just erase it! You can view images all in a row (just push the tele button towards W) with easy access to a particular pic (push the tele to T). You can zoom into the image (not many dig cams offer that). This is so fun to use!! You can set it to auto, or manual settings. You can even have partial manual and partial auto! This is one digital cam that lets you have the settings the way you want them, or let the camera take control. Want a black and white photo? Just switch the setting under FUNCTION. Dont like that it takes the photo at the end of the cycle? Change it to the beginning or middle under SLOW. You can change any setting while looking at your subject.

I dont really like the software that comes with it, but you have to use it to download the pics onto your pc (if anyone knows any other way, please let me know!). It's nice in that you can see your photos all at once, but it doesnt allow much manipulation. You cant even crop! I tend to use PhotoShop.

The manual is the best I have ever had to read. I actually dont mind having to refer to it when needed. The contents are wonderful. It really DOES help you to learn the camera's functions. Very detailed!!

It's small, lightweight, easy to hold (I have small hands). a great digital camera for the pro or the novice.<br><br>
