            We bought a 1996 Dodge Ram pickup near the end of 1996, when the 1997 models were just out (figured we'd get a better deal that way!). The deal was pretty good, but of course the choices were limited.  We managed to get one nicely equipped, with power locks and doors, cruise control, CD player, nice cloth interior, compass/temperature gauge, along with all of the basics.

In the beginning, it was a nice ride - especially compared to the ancient 1984 beat-up Dodge truck that my husband had at the time (which I luckily rarely had to ride in).  And it was a nice change to the Corolla I had at the time, I found it fun to ride so high over a lot of the other drivers. I didn't drive it much though since it was for my husband and I preferred my car since I was used to smaller vehicles.  I don't know if it's the shocks, the fact that some of our commute is on bumpy, twisty country roads, or what, but now I don't much like riding in or driving it because the ride is bumpy and noisy.  A little less bumpy on the main roads, but still loud.

However, it still does what trucks do best - it hauls stuff.  We've hauled furniture, dirt, glass, firewood, all sorts of stuff.  My husband finds it especially handy to haul his dirt bike and related equipment to his every-other-weekend races from February through October.  His old truck never would have made it but this one holds up just great for everything he does with it.

I'm not much of a truck person, though it's fun to drive sometimes, but this is a pretty good-looking truck, sturdy and dependable.  Just a little loud.
