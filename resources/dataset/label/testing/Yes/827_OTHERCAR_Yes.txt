            Two years ago, I spent almost $900 on a Kodak DC 210 digital camera that doesn't offer half the features of this camera (well, that is the curse/blessing of technology). Its shutter speed was extremely slow, the quality of the pictures was only so-so, the red-eye reduction was iffy at best, and it ate batteries like M&Ms. If you wanted good picture quality, you needed to use its proprietary image format that my upgraded graphics software didn't seem to support anymore. And this was a top-rated camera in its day.

When I finally decided to replace it (after a set of batteries on the old one seemed to last less time than it took to take and review a single picture), I was prepared to spend a similar amount of money for all the features I wanted. 

I wanted a speedier shutter, a true zoom lens (not a digital zoom), good macro capabilities, a red-eye reduction flash that actually worked, and good battery life. I wanted at least 2.1 megapixel resolution, the ability to save photos in either JPG or TIFF -- no proprietary image formats, thank you very much. I didn't want or need video and wasn't willing to pay extra for that feature. I have a digital camcorder; if I want movies, I'll use that instead. My search whittled down to the HP PhotoSmart 618.

I run a couple professional business websites dedicated to cats, so most of the pictures I take are either of cats or of people and cats at cat shows. The several seconds it took for my shutter to go off with my old camera, and the several seconds it took to recharge between shutter presses, was unacceptable. The 618's adjustable shutter speed is proving a godsend. The red-eye reduction works far, far better than my old Kodak, a critical feature when photographing cats. 

The color reproduction of this camera is remarkably good, which is critical because one of the things I am planning to add to my site is a cat coat color encyclopedia. The Kodak added a lot of yellow to the photos; as far as I can tell, the 618 requires no color correction at all. This will allow this project to go forward.

For me, the comfort and weight of a camera are very important. Although I am only 33 years old, I have arthritis in my hands. A camera that is too small will cramp my hands, whereas a camera that is too large and heavy gets burdensome after time. The 618 is a very comfortable camera, even with my fairly-small hands. 

Displays are clear and easy to use, once you figure out how they work. The documentation for menu navigation is a bit vague. Once you figure it out, it's very easy. It just took me about fifteen minutes to figure my way around the controls. 

The 618 has both an optical and digital zoom, which, at its low price, is truly wonderful. When I purchased my Kodak two years ago, a digital camera with a zoom lens cost at least $700. 

My expertise is in photography for the Web, not in photography for print, so I cannot comment on its print quality. However, it's fabulous for Web use and I can recommend it very highly for this purpose.
