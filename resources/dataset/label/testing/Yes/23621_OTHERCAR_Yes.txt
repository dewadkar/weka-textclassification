            The Jeep Cherokee in my opinion is the best SUV on the road as far as price goes. The sporty looks give it immediate thumbs up. There are many different things that you can do to it to spice up the looks if you are not satisfied with the stock look. Brush guards, rims, tires, and nerf bars all are unique but unfortunately expensive additions. The interior of the Cherokee is stylish but simple. In keeping with the Jeep tradition, the Cherokee is known for its off-road ability. It performs well in the mud and can handle most off-roading tasks. If you are serious about transforming the Cherokee into an off-road beast, a lift and larger tires are recommended. the good thing about lifting the Cherokee is the front straight axel. It is much easier to lift any vehicle with a straight axel as opposed to Independent Front Suspension (IFS). the handling on the Cherokee is not too good stock, even with the sport package. I suggest doing what I did to my Cherokee. For about $250 Bilstein shocks make a world of a difference. As with any vehicle, you should have it serviced frequently. The Cherokee Is a great buy and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for good quality in an inexpensive SUV. <br><br>
