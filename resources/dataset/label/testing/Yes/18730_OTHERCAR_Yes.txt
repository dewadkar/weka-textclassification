                Forget the old saying, "There's only one Jeep," becuase now, "There's only one SUV." The 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best Sport Utility Vehicle on the market, and that's the truth.
     Daimer Chrysler has made many improvements on the powerful Grand Cherokee since the new design was unvailed in 1999. The new 2001 Grand Cherokee features a new wheel design, a new trim on the grille, and many other internal and external niceties that make the Jeep look super cool, and drive extrodinarily.
   What makes the Grand Cherokee different then other similar Sport Ute's, is that it performs GREAT in any type of weather condition. With the select-trac drive mode, you can switch from 2WD, to 4 FullWD to 4WD Part time with a turn of the wrist. Driving in heavy snow, thick ice, or even in a blizzard is no challenge for the Grand Cherokee. If you're vehicle has Selec-Trac, then engaging it in 4WD Part Time will let you drive down any road or trek up any mountain no matter how much white fluff has packed the pavement. The spectacular quadra-drive system is also available on Grand Cherokees, but has full time four wheel drive but also burns more gas. 
   The interior of Grand Cherokees is incredible. Weather you have the plush leather seating, or the agate cloth, the seats are very comfertable and very durable. Also, the back passengers have a lot of leg room, considerably more than passengers in a Honda passport or a Lexus RX370. 
    The Grand Cherokee's capability to transport anything is probably the reason why I bought it. You can fit skis, many grocery bags, sporting equipment, and even large, heavy musical equipment with ease. The 60/40 split rear seats aids the driver who needs to transport such large items. Another great nicety of the Jeep is that the spare tire is located in a hidden compartment in the trunk, and acsess to it is very simple, by pulling up a handle, you can see that the spare tire is conveniently located inside the car and out of site, to aid your driving experience.
    Weather you get a simple CD player with your Jeep, or a grand 10-disc player located in the trunk, you will be very satisfied with the sound quality of your sound system. The buttons and knobs on the CD face are very easy to use and like all Chrysler cars, are hassle free.
   The Grand Cherokee also has high powered high beams, great for nighttime driving. The great alarm system will keep your Jeep theft-free and give you some piece of mind. Located on all Jeeps is the upper-head console, that displays temperature, and has the ability to program many functions of your own Jeep, very quickly and very easily. 
   If you decide to purchase one of the accessories from Mopar, you will realize that these products give your Jeep the ultimate look. A nice Grille Guard makes any Grand Cherokee look tough and herculean! 
   The primary reason I tell everyone to look into purchasing a Grand Cherokee is just knowing that you'll be able to depend on your JGC at any time. It rides incredibly smooth and the V8 engine provides much power and pick up.      
    It doesn't matter if you're in snow, rain, sleet, or sand, you'll know the moment you buy a Jeep that it will get you to wherever you need to go. I can faithfully say that this is the greatest car I have ever owned, and will most likley be the only model I own. Do yourself and your mind a favor, purchase this American Made Vehicle as soon as you can. For Under 30,000 dollars and with a mile-long list of available options, you will know you made the right choice.
