            This past July I was in the market for a reliable used car.  My mother and I had rented a 2000 Taurus to drive to my brother's house in June and I loved it.  I looked for one that was possibly a program car but still could not afford a 2000.  I did luck upon a 1999 Taurus SE that had more miles on it than I liked, but the interior was spotless and it drove great.  Needless to say I bought it.

I was finishing my teaching practicum for my Master's degree and was putting over 100 miles a day on it.  I had no problems with the car at all.  It seemed as if I was supposed to have THAT car.  I finished my practicum and had owned the car for about 3 weeks.  One night I had been up late studying for my comprehensive exam to complete my Master's.  I, unfortunately, ran out of cigarettes and decided to run down to the store a couple of miles away and get a pack.  Something happened on my way home and I had a wreck.  I say &quot;something&quot; because I have no recollection of the wreck or anything for about 3 days after.  From the description of the wreck that has been told to me, the car left the road and I went through a man's yard.  I ended up hitting the man's Dodge 3/4 ton truck broadside and knocked it into a 1970 dump truck.  All 3 vehicles were totaled.  It took the fire department about an hour and a half to extricate me from the car.

I suffered a broken pelvis, broke the tibia in my left leg and ruptured my diaphragm.  I spent 12 days in the hospital and was off work for 3 months. Everyone who saw the wreck and what was left of my Taurus said that it was a miracle that I am alive.  I was told this by policemen who had seen many wrecks.  They also told me they had never seen a car so badly damaged and have the occupant survive.

I know it was the structure of the car that saved me.  I am a walking testament to the claims by Ford and others that the Taurus is the safest in it's class. <br><br>
