            I have recently purchased my first digital camera, the FD83, and I love it. I have used the FD73 for my school several times and I knew I had to get one.
I bought it from Circuit City for $600 with a mail in rebate, but every single dollar was worth it. The camera takes beautiful pictures and they're great for printing out on glossy paper. It takes pics in three different resolutions, and either standard or fine format. The floppy drive is very good, in that you can buy several disks really cheap and never run out of space. Also, you can make mini-movies with it that come out in good quality. Voice recording is also a neat feature.
The flash is excellent on the camera and you can adjust its levels too.
Overall the camera is great and it is feature packed. It is worth the money, and if you have more money and need more features and even higher quality, got for a higher version Mavica. I know I'll be sticking with the Mavica for a while.<br><br>
