            I bought my 1995 Volkswagen Passat in May of 2001. It's a GLX, with the VR6 engine. The VR6 is reknowned for being peppy and powerful. High in horsepower, but low in torque -- this car is fun to drive, once you learn how.

The interior is extremely roomy (I am an amateur musician, and it manages to fit my bass cabinet, amp and bass guitar, which is impressive), which is nice in a sedan.

I had some trouble straightoff with a few of the interior parts coming off -- a doorlock piece came off (lock still functions, however), and I had a long piece of metal rain down from above from the moonroof (which also still functions without it). It seems like Volkswagen had a habit of putting a lot of extra, unnecessary. parts in their cars, I guess.

I also have some trouble with the ABS light coming on, but I understand this was a common problem with the B4 Passats. I am looking into having this fixed -- I'll let you know if I figure out what it was.

All in all, the B4 Passats are great cars. An economical, sensible sedan. Go for the VR6 if you want something fun to drive, too.
