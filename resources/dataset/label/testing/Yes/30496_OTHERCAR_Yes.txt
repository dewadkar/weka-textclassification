            I must say I came away with a different impression. First style is truly an individual matter. So when I read statements of cladding and spoilers, I simply say I love the sheet metal. When I started to research this full size  sedan, the thought that within this price range, I have a lot of choices BMW, Lexus, Nissan, Toyota, Cadillac. Do not get me wrong I liked all the cars I tested for one reason or another and cars like BMW 3, Audi 4 Quattro, Chrysler 300M, ES300 Lexus were in the final running. There were so many cars I liked. So first, I reviewed the luxury models  and bottom line, to small. The BMW 3, Audi A4 are compact size cars and I liked driving the cars, but for luxury cars, I found them limited on features, like Eye Cue display or load leveling with air compressor or OnStar.  I like the styling of both the BMW 3 and Audi A4 and both offer all wheel drive. The reviewer was correct in one option that seems missing from the Bonneville SSEi, navigation, gee the Pontiac Vibe has navigation.  So, eliminated BMW 3 and Audi A4, wonderful cars but too small. By the way when I compared BMW, Audi or Cadillac models that were the size and room of the Pontiac Bonneville SSEi, I found prices ranged from $40k to over $70k, suddenly I understood why I really liked the Bonneville SSEi size in class value. Ok, so which cars ended up in the final run with Bonneville SSEi, well the Chrysler 300M and the Lexus ES300. The 300M was in the final running until its safety results were rated average overall compared to Pontiac's Bonneville rated good and Best in Class. Now for the Lexus ES300, this was easy, simply said, not my kind of luxury car. Very traditional, a little limo and I could not get past the styling, to each his own. But one comment on the Lexus ES300, the best looking interior of all the cars I reviewed, makes BMW look plain. Other cars such as Acura TL to the RL again wonderful cars but the TL is a mid size sedan and the RL over $40k, but I liked them, but no passion, again a matter of individual taste. So, when all was said and done the price I paid for the Bonneville SSEi was, well down right eye popping, mouth open shocking. An all optioned Black Bonneville SSEi (except for Heated Seats) maintenance and extend warranty for 6yr/100,000 miles, $32k at 0% for 60mo.
What I enjoy most about this car, sheet metal, features (Onstar is absolutely wonderful, Virtual Advisor News, Hands Free phone and e-mail just for starters) I have used Onstar to unlock my car when rushed for meeting in NY, I dropped my keys in the car and locked the doors. Let me tell you, I was not a happy camper and magic, a call to Onstar, bing, my doors were open and I went on with my day. I also used Onstar for directions when I needed get to a client's home and I was directed to the very driveway. Trunk size is wonderful, Home Depot and Cosco here I come. The seats are very comfortable but not for true sport driving. But other than that, wonderful seats with power lumbar support and I have adjusted these seats just right for the wife and I. I could go on and on about this full size sedan, but it is time to call it a night. My hat is off to Pontiac for building such a wonderful high tech, powerful, full featured and fun sedan.
