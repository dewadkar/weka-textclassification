            If you are looking for a great 4-Wheel drive, sporty little SUV, then this is the car for you.  I bought my Jeep almost 2 years ago and have truly enjoyed driving it.  I wanted an car that was high up off the ground, safe to drive in the snow, and not too expensive.  This perfectly fit into our budget.  It drives very nicely, and the pick up is pretty quick.

However, if you are looking for room, or for a car that has efficient gas mileage. This is not the car for you. The Jeep Cherokee is not a large SUV by any means.  The Grand Cherokee is significantly bigger, and in the same breath it is also about $6-7,000.00 more too.  And, I have been a bit disappointed with the gas mileage. Perhaps all SUV's are like this, but it sure seems like I fill up the car with gas a lot!<br><br>
