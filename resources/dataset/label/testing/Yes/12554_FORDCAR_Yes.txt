            I have had my Tempo for about a year, and I really like it. There are many parts that I don't like, but there is something about this Tempo that I like. I have found this to be a very reliable car. I don't think that I've taken it in much, and some of it is just routine. The gas mileage is good, not great but good. 
I think that this car feels very substantial. It feels safe on the roads, and in icy conditions, it seems to have a good grip on the road. This is what I like the most about the Tempo. The cabin gives you good headroom, and the rear seats are more comfortable than the front. The rear seat is a little small though. The trunk is large, which is great for vacations. 
The exterior of this car is, in my opinion, good looking. It is clean and conservative. 
There are plenty of things that I don't like about the Tempo. The controls are very bad. The radio is okay, but the heat and windshield wipers are terrible. There are two rotary controls, which are okay, and there a series of buttons with words, not pictures on them. If you use A/C, you can't choose where to direct it, it comes through the front. 
The seats in the front and not very good either. The don't really hold you. The are comfortable, but they don't stop you from sliding, and are not very wide either. The sight out of the car is okay, but the front is a little high, making it a little harder to see. The rear-view mirror is mounted a little low, and makes it hard to see to the right side out of the front windshield.
I have the four cylinder engine, which is a little underpowered, but not that weak. It will get you where you want to go, but is not for people who like performance. The handling and suspension aren't terrible, but aren't so great. When you drive slow, it feels like you are driving a tank. The bumps aren't hidden, but I am sure the suspension could be worse. The three speed doesn't make the highway driving easier, but 60 on the highway is not problem.
Overall, this car isn't great, but it is worth the low price. I have found my Tempo to be reliable, and I think that is really the most important factor in a commuter car.
