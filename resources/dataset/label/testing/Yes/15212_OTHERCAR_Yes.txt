            Overall I have to say I am pleased with the Sienna.  Just over 25K miles and no major troubles.  No mechanical troubles at all, in fact.  It runs quietly and well.  Good acceleration for a mini-van.  Shifts well and smoothly; drops to acceleration gear appropriately.

Handling on the road is good, but the turning radius is only fair, making it more difficult to get into and out of those tight parking spots.  Suspension is very soft (my personal preference is a much sportier suspension); you won't even know you are driving this vehicle.

Interior layout is generally good.  Controls are easy to locate and operate, particularly the radio controls on the steering wheel.  Durability of some of the trim leaves some to be desired, as several small pieces have popped off or otherwise disappeared.

All of the seats come out for quite a spacious cabin.  Removal of the seats is very simple for the back two (the two most frequently removed), but requires a little more jockeying for the front two.  Ease of re-installation is fair; the latches can get closed easily, leaving you trying to fit the seat in with a closed latch (impossible).  When you do get it open, there is a relatively small target spot for it to latch into, not very visible from wherever you are.  The latch positions into which the seats fit do tend to accumulate dirt and grime during normal use, no less the use the kids have seen fit to dole out...

All of the seats are generally comfortable for adults, but the leg room on all seats is not excessive.  A 6'0" frame fits just so; taller folks would feel a bit cramped.  On long trips, the driver and front passenger will find not much room to move or stretch out.

Gas mileage is relatively good at about 27 mpg with mostly city driving.  On the road it climbs to the low thirties.  I recommend a bag for the roof rack--great for preserving room inside the cabin for the road trip, with little hassle and little effect on mileage.
