            Not much credit has been given to the Bronco II.  I currently own a 1990 4WD Bronco II and will not give it up for anything.  Being a student, I commute back and forth from Shreveport to Ruston, which is about 150 miles round trip.  Even being a 1990 model, I still get around 22MPG, which is very nice considering current gas prices.  The turning radius cannot be beat.  Having to park in limited-space college lots, I can really appreciate this attribute.
To shoot it straight, I have never had a problem going off-road.  The 4WD capability is very well-suited to size of the vehicle.  I was able pull a U-turn in a clay infested field with street tires needless to say, and if anyone knows how messy clay can get, you'll appreciate that feat with ill-equipped treads.  The motor is in excellent condition even with 140000+ miles.  It does not eat or leak oil and does not run hot.  The only problem that I have with the Bronco II is its high center of gravity.  This does not mix well with high speed, corners, and a little ignorance on my part.  However, once a feel for this vehicle has been found, the driver will know what it can and can't do, just like any other vehicle.  I decided not to part ways with mine after it pulled me through some hell and high water.  When anonymous people tell you to, "Hang on to it.", you know you have something worth doing just that.
