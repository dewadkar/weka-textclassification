 I bought my truck in '95. I was looking for something with room a V6 and fourwheel drive. I enjoy
 working with trucks and making them better so I know the ins and outs of these machines. First a little
 background on them. They were introduced in 1984.  In '86 fuel injection was introduced and the 2.8 was droped for
 the 2.9L EFI which was a huge improvement and produced 140 HP. In '87 antilock brakes were offered. The first  styling change came in '90 when the front sheet metal was reworked for a newer look. (91-94 explorer front.) The basic mechanicals were didn't changed and parts are interchangeable. The best ones to buy are post '88. In '88 a new cylinder head was devolped to
 prevent cracking. However, I have had no problems with the heads on my '86 even when run with very
 little water. If you have problems world products sells a head to fix it. The absolute best engine is the
 2.9L. They simply last FOREVER. I have 250,000 miles on mine and have had no problems what so
 ever. The 2.8 is of the same design and should last as long but is less desiraable because of low
 power. While there is not a wealth of performance parts for the 2.9 there are enough out there to build
 as much power as you need (200HP+). And the 2.3L four had been in mustangs for years so it has
 plenty of support. If your looking to get a lift
 there are many out there. I have a James Duff 3&quot; kit. By the way James Duff is a HUGE source since
 they specialize in rangers and bronco IIs. Also body lifts are out there. I could not find one that had
 bumper brackets so your on your own on that one. If your planing on running really large tires (34&quot;+)
 you may want to upgrade to a dana 35 front axle from a 4.0l ranger or explorer. There are many web
 sights that deal with these trucks. Fordranger.com has more info than I could ever list here. This is
 the first place that I would recomend. These really are great trucks and they can be had for next to
 nothing. Just be careful because once you start building one of these you may not be able to stop. I
 thought a 3&quot; lift was enough but four years later it has a 6&quot; lift, bumper and a winch, side steps, limited
 slip, and engine mods. <br><br>
