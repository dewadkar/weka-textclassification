            First let me say that I do not like the Accord Commercials. They, in no way, do this car justice. But in retrospect, maybe that's a good thing. I do not want a car that EVERYONE has, nor should you. 

200 HP V6. Whats that mean. That means sinking you in your seat at 80 MPH. It means pulling you out of a bind - now. It launches you into the carpool lane with instant excitement. It also means a wonderful long distance cruise, and yes, a ticket if youre not careful. Drat!

When I bought this I was comparing against a Mustang V-8. It has 215 HP, but realy low on the comfort level. The Accord has the leather seats, auto climate control, and many other features. So I have not had any regrets. 

The ride. When I first got it, I had a heck of a time staying under 80mph. Not because I like to drive fast.. not meee, nooo... but beacuse there is very little sensation of speed. It has a very comfortable ride, leather seats - my friends dose off to sleep all the time (or is it me?)and excellant handling. After a 6 hour drive from San Fran to Vegas, I was still offering to go to the store for my friends, not even feeling as if I drove all day. Thats impressive. I have the 99 version and have put on 50,000 miles now as of this week. I am still impressed like I have never been with any car that I have owned... which is about 10.

Sound Jams, alhough I wish the stereo had pre-amp outputs for the additon of my own amps. I also would have liked better bass extension. Cant have everything I guess. When I drive I like the music loud, deep and crips. This system is ok, but lacks the authority that the rest of the car posses.

This car is a beautiful work of art and well designed. It cleans up well. I have an Ebony Black one, black tinted rear windows, spoiler, charcoal leather interior. I hand wash and hand polish it. When all shiny, it incessantly turns heads, rubbernecking as people pass by, its funny. I get compliments on it all the time. It is perfect for toting your loved one to a fine dining establishment, wedding, or other foofie event. Elegant. Its just a very pretty car - thank you designer people - hats off.

Service is very low. I replaced the breake pads ($700) at 45,000 and a few lightbulbs (breaks lights) They said it was because I drove a lot and thus breaked a lot. I think light bulbs should last. I had 15 and 25 year-old cars with the origional bulbs in it. But its a small thing and even the bulb manufacture's have got kids to feed, so not a biggie. the only other thing I dont like is its suseptability t door dings. The slightest ding shows and definately raises my blood tempurature. Auugh! Wny? 

One last dislike is the problem  getting it tinted. You need to get a guarantee on the rear window tinting. The problem lies in the FM antenna, which is imbedded in the top of the rear window. It is above the defroster lines. This requires extra &quot;half tone&quot; shading dods and makes it hard for the tinting mylar to stick. Notice many accords (mine included)have peeling of the tinting disease at the top rear window. This was an irritant from day one for me - especially on a black car. If anyone has a solution for this, please email me.

I would highly recommend this car for people that have a flare for taking off on a drive at any time, gotta cool date coming up, or just want to be driving coolness everywhere. Nay If you have a lot of kids, or are older and need more room to get in or out, or are above 6'6&quot; It aint small, but but is not an SUV either, nor is it a caprice classic.

$25,000 base price. Price I paid was - absolutely fully loaded except the air package, including tax and lic, fees, $31,000. and change. Add financing charges and Im at $36,000. Still, definately worth it. The only other car I wuold concider without jumping to the Carerra, is the Acura TL. Its bit more grown up (4 dr). But the Accord is definately the best bang for the buck.

Enjoy, George
