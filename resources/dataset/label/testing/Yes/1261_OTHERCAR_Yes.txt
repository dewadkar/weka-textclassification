            Nikon Coolpix 990 has take a relay-race Coolpix 950, amendable some its defect (having save herewith general design), and has get 3 megapixel matrix.

&quot;Native brother&quot; popular Nikon Coolpix 950 (but that repeatedly confessed the to be best in its class) has inherit all line of this family. Design of Coolpix 990 is distinguish only by the size of red rubberized bracket under fingers a right of hand and location of some nodes, control handles, as well as device name. Controls in this camera are herewith completely changed, though, in spite of the considerable price, this on essences still &quot;soap dish&quot;. Black &quot;anthracite&quot; body from the alloy magnesium with aluminum on former consists of two parts, revolve friend for the friend.

Workmanship, as would be expected, above the average, and if you already used cameras such eccentric design (consist from two parts), standard and for some other series representatives Coolpix, know that they enough comfortable in use.

Necessary to note also specially design optics with the variable focal length Nikkor-Zoom for getting the high optical quality expressing on all range of changing a focus.

Enabling a device and switching the modes of removal/reproduction on former is realized by the revolve ring, which surrounds button (it is distinguish from the former camera only more suitable location of inscriptions). Ring has a small salient, which relieves a switching by same index finger, which presses on button. Moreover then, when camera is switch off, salient is locate on axis of device, that prevents its nonfree cut-in, if you suddenly touch its anything in the bag.

Except the off-hour position, switch has three main modes: mode of completely automatic removal (A), manual mode (�), which allows an user to change parameters of adjusting a camera, and, finally, mode of reproduction (Play) for viewing expressing on LCD-screen.

Controls of new camera governing are advanced and in some cases much more are rationally situated that does Coolpix 990 vastly more suitable and friend camera, than 950. Command Dial, which beside Coolpix 950 is stand on the front panel of camera, is now install on upper panels with the salient on back part, under the thumb a right of hand. This Dial is intended for switching in modes with the priority of diaphragm, endurance's or in the manual mode completely. Besides, it allows quickly changing such important installation, as a focusing, balance of white or expocorrection without needing addressing to the camera menu.

Two new buttons, place from both sides of cola of switching the modes, execute a double role: in the automatic mode left serves for switching a displaying of endurance/diaphragms, but ruling, in combinations with the Command Dial, - entering an expocorrection; in the manual mode by default left button in combinations with the Command Dial switches modes of removal (A, S, P, P*), but ruling also serves for expocorrection, but here both of them are to be reprogram under any other functions from the menu Control, ensuring direct access to some from the most often used functions.

Buttons, situated a little below LCD-screen, also execute a double function. By default they are clear promark. The First button round-robin passes landscape shooting (blocking a focus on infinity), macromode (with the minimum distance before the object 2 refer to) and autostart. (On all preceding models Nikon was absent a possibility of use autostart in the mode, but beside Coolpix 990 Nikon, opposite, has allow to use its only there. Absolutely incomprehensible decision�) Second button switches modes of flash, but third controls a quality a shots. In combinations with the Command Dial first accordingly exposes manually focal length, second - changes sensitivity in ISO, but third manages a permit an shots.

In the new camera on the right on LCD-screen has appear a suitable joystick with arrows in four directions, which is first of all use for navigation and choice from the menu, but, besides, serves and for the choice of area of focusing in the new mode Autofocus Area Mode. LCD-Display Itself was, in contrast with Coolpix 950 (with 2 inches before 1,8), several is reduced, but worse from this did not become, but opposite, is get brighter and contrast. Additionally indicators panel beside the new camera several is enlarge, displaying now more information. Functions a menu are flash bright and comprehensible pictographs, their position sensibly and navigation is simple. Jack for CF-cards is move from the bottom of device to the right wall, and now card possible to extract not removing camera. Besides, 

Ports for the output now more suitable situated - down from the side, but jack for the connection of power supply unit although and on-former is not particularly suitable is situated (wire on the side optics - not best decision), but in contrast with the predecessor - Coolpix 950 - this evident progress.

So, from standpoints an ergonomics Nikon Coolpix 990 - camera with non-many defects (big part on Coolpix 950 is already correct), its control is easy master by the majority of the people and likes many photographers.


Features

In Coolpix 990 is used big matrix (1/1,8 inch) with gross amount of elements in 3,34 million pixels (efficient - 3,14 million), allowing create images with the maximum size in 2048 x 1536 pixels. Camera is equiped optics Zoom-Nikkor with 3-times swing of focal length from 8 before 24 mms (from 38 before 115 mms in the equivalent of film 35 mms). It enough &quot;light&quot;, start apertures - 1:2,6 on &quot;short&quot; end (38 mms) and 1:4 on &quot;long&quot; (115 mms). It is a broad choice of different adjustages and parameters of adjustment, to get optimum results with the additional optics.

Appear seven additional intermediate positions of diaphragm, but range of endurance is increase (from 1/1000 before 8 seconds). A sensitivity matrix is defined automatically or is expose 100 ISO, 200 ISO or 400 ISO. 

Save expressing possible also in following sizes: 3:2 (2048 x 1360), XGA (1024 x 768) and VGA (640 x 480). Co to all permits possible to use three different compression levels (Fine, Normal, Basic), but at the desire (only in &quot;manual&quot; mode) shots possible to save and without compression in TIFF standard format.

In the automatic mode (A) Coolpix 990 offers three possibility of focusing: normal, endless and macro. Camera is capable to display subjects with very close distance (2 refer to). In the manual mode a focal length can be sail be change (from 10 refer to ad infinitum for 50 steps), automaton works else more exactly (from 30 refer to ad infinitum for 4896 steps).

In the manual mode a camera offers much more powers.

- possible shots both singles images and series;
- possible shots three frames with the automatic determination of exposures, as well as &quot;underexposure&quot; and &quot;over-exposure&quot;;
- is it automatically choose best image from the series (system chooses the most &quot;sharp&quot; scene abreast);
- automatic removal &quot;stray noises&quot; matrix;

But the most, probably, amazing addition, which has get a camera Coolpix 990, is a facility of building of histogram of expressing (meet earlier on expensive professional cameras of type Sony DSC-D770 only or Nikon D1). Histogram will give you objective information on brightness of shot and will allow doing unambiguous findings on its &quot;over-exposure&quot; or &quot;underexposure&quot; (moreover &quot;re-shine&quot; area will be shown as blink areas). Histogram for any shot possible to see in the mode Preview, when you will extract detail information on shot.


Photo quality

Certainly, than more resolution of images, that greater on the size you may as a result of print without visible changes from shot. But Nikon Coolpix 990 gives a good quality even on shots low resolution (comparable, for instance, with maximum for 1,5-megapixel cameras), that is ensured by three factors: first, optics Nikkor-Zoom with the beautiful focusing system and good details, secondly, beautiful measurement system to exposures on the matrix from 256 segments and, in-third - algorithms of processing a scene. Measurement to exposures on this algorithm of company Nikon far enough aptly, that many shots to get some other way much difficult (for instance, take pictures &quot;against the sun&quot;).

Thereby, even when using completely automatic mode a camera chooses a best exposure (and defraud it in this sense enough difficult), but transition in the mode of manual setting allows correct all possible mistakes automations, save a scene in non compressed format or even at all back out of &quot;recommendations&quot; automations, as well as decide any creative problems.

Photos are got without visible artifacts (even under high degrees of compression of artifacts practically is not seen) and sufficiently detailed (unlike preceding models, in this device contrast and clearness of sidebars is adjust better), but measurement to exposures best. Additionally Nikkor practically does not distort even on &quot;long&quot; side (115 mms) and gives only quite small &quot;barrel&quot; distort in &quot;short&quot; area (38 mms).

Even under strong compression of photography save a high quality level, but increasing of sensitivity before 200 or even before 400 ISO enlarges a level of noises not far enough powerfully, as in devices of company Canon.

To be short, Nikon Coolpix 990 - best camera on the quality of photos.


Interface of user

Menu in the device Coolpix 990 is completely changed. It become vastly more suitable and in use more simply. Having Press to corresponding to button and having cause menu on LCD-screen, you will be able to realize and choice, and installing the necessary values with the help of one only joystick-navigator.

Moreover in the automatic mode is caused simplify menu, but in &quot;manual&quot; - more complex, with three &quot;folders&quot; and extended options. All parameters a cancelling by comprehensible pictographs and are provided with by textual explanations, appearing on the top of screen. Moreover choice of parameters from first two folders possible to realize as just, with the help of Command Dial, so and causing on the arrow of joystick additional screens with explanations. Moreover, in spite of the smaller size, LCD-screen Coolpix 990 much brighter, than was beside Coolpix 950, and far easier read even at fine day illumination.

In the mode of reproduction a menu ensures a suitable viewing, protection from casual deleting (moreover some expressing possible even to hide from viewing), removing the unnecessary expressing and preparation to print (DCF-standard, DPOF-compatibility).


Software

Nikon Coolpix 990 is deliver together with two compact-disks with software: first is kept Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 and PDF-versions of manual of user of camera on different languages (Nikon Guide to Digital Photography); the second includes a program NikonView Version 3.0 and for Macintosh, and for Windows. NikonView - this utility, which serves for viewing the photographies and transmissions them on the computer. Carrying the expressing from Coolpix 990 is eazy, either as previously. Under its calling is openned standard interface window, which one of the directories is the contents of memories of camera. Hereon any scene possible to view and save on the computer disk. However now, on USB-an interface, given will be send by leaps and bounds.

In the same way, either as preceding devices of company Nikon, Coolpix 990 is not control from the computer base software, but as far as it is made on chipset company Sierra Imaging once again, for he exists variety of programs (including free and conditionally-free), which realize a full-fledged control and removal from the computer.<br><br>
