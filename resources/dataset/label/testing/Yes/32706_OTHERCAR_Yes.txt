            First two years drove over 60K miles, bought with 94K on it. 
This is a versatile vehicle. There is nothing I have seen like it. , 3 rows of seats. The 3rd row, you can only fit 2 kids (under 6). Great gas mileage. If you lay down the two rows of back seats, you can carry lots of goodies. I coach track, & have fit 5 kids (15 years old), and equipment. Also, ran my mobile business out of it. But when I need to go camping with my family, or pull the boat, it has not let me down. About 350 miles to the tank. 16 gallons. My problem has been declaring if it is a station wagon, minivan, or SUV. Its been called all.

I love this car. Although, it has not been running for about 6 months, I still say its a solid car. In Oct 2000, the crankshaft pulley separated from its damper. Too shorten this story, a week later; I finally got the $100 bucks, to buy a new crankshaft pulley w/damper. After replacing this, I found out, I need have the timing adjusted, just been lazy. The only other negative, I don't believe is a problem from the manufacturer. 

Two days after purchasing this used car (94000 miles), someone hit the car. The passenger side bumper, fender, and headlight needed replacement, along with hood. I found out later, the repair shop took as many shortcuts as possible. They bondo-ed as much as they could, and replaced only my headlight. This was supposed to be the $2000 job they were paid to do. 
After the months wait for the repairs, my electrical system was, and still is damaged. Keep in mind there was nothing wrong with the car before. After all we drove it almost a month before sending it to the shop. 

To summarized,

Pros:
Braking, good paint & body, performance, versatile, gas mileage, somewhat roomy, don't want to get rid of it. 

Cons: 
post body shop electrical problems, can't find another for sale, parts store show wrong spark plug numbers.
