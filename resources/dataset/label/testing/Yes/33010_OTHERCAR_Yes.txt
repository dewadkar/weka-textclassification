            I recently purchased a 1999 GMC Sierra 1500 extended cab.  The truck also has SLT package, Z-71 package, and towing package.  Overall, the truck has performed flawlessly; the performance (327 cid) and gas mileage were as expected, plenty of power and acceleration and about 16 mpg no matter where or how it is driven.  I guess partially due to the extended cab, the truck rides much better than I expected, it isn't a cadillac, but it isn't supposed to be, especially with the heavy duty suspension.  

However, I have had a few small problems. One is evidently a trademark of Z-71's, the 4-wheel drive system works wonderfully, but makes a lot of noise when engaged. Sort of a grinding noise, but everyone I have talked to advised that all Z-71's make it and it is normal. The only other problem I have experienced is quite a few rattles and vibrations ranging from door panels to dashboard and even the back of the passenger's seat.

Over all a great truck and I would recommend it but I would recommend it without the leather seats. They don't hold up nearly as well with hard use.<br><br>
