            About a month ago my family took a trip to Rochester, which is about 400 miles from where i live. We rented 2 cars, a Saturn and a 2001 Buick LeSabre, Now i have to say, after driving both, the Buick was my favorite. My sister and brother belong to a buick club so i would never tell them this, but i loved this car. It was Soooo roomy. It had Plenty of room for everything we packed to go this distance, and not to mention we were traveling with a baby, and anyone who has children knows that you have to pack alot of stuff when you have them with you. The trunk was huge, we packed a play-crib, a stroller, a cooler, and some luggage, and we had room left over. In the car itself we had the car seat, and there was plenty of floor room by the it that we put my moms luggage there. If space is what you need, this car is perfect. The interior was very comfortable, the split bench seats were more comfortable than i had thought they would be, i am used to bucket seats, but these were amazing, i could recline back and feel like i was in my Lazy-Boy at home. Also the radio in the car sounded great, and it had the channel changing buttons on the steering wheel, which made it so much easier to pay attention to the road, i could even adjust the volume from there. This car had so much to offer. Gas mileage was just as good as the smaller saturn, which must mean something. And it had extra visors that you could pull out to the sides, like on the older models, that was great also. All in all, i would become a salesperson for this specific car if i didn't already have a job as a mom. I enjoyed the long drive in this car immensely. I would recommend trying to rent one for a weekend to see how great it is. This way you can make a decision before buying it!
