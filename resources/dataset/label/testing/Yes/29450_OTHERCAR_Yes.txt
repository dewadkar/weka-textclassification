            I bought the vehicle so I could have an all weather, any terrain or road condition vehicle that could take punishment on the awful Rhode Island Roads.
Love:
The upgrades to the new jeeps in suspension, brakes, and safety have made the new jeeps great vehicles.  They are still as tough as ever but now have some comforts of other vehicles such as a similar suspension of the Grand Cherokee, anti-lock brakes (optional), and air-bags.  The ride is still a fun, bouncy one but I don't feel unsafe in any driving conditions.  
When I was on an icy road, I came unexpectedly upon a car which was turned sideways in the road.  There were other vehicles already off the road to each side.  The car was frantically trying to get off the road as I neared.  I applied the brakes and maintained control and safely made it around the vehicle.  I was not worried because not only did I have the anti-lock brakes, but if I did have to go off the road, I had one of the best vehicles for that.
Nothing rattles on my jeep even after a year of abuse.
Hate:
The only negative I have about my jeep is that whenever I encounter a dip in the road which affects only one side of the vehicle there is a hard rock to the vehicle.  I think this could be fixed with some type of anti-sway bar.
Anybody who wants a tough safe vehicle for the winter should consider the jeep wrangler.  If you need alot of cargo and passenger space you shouldn't buy the wrangler.  Try the Cherokees.
The price below is for the Sahara version with alot of upgrades.<br><br>
