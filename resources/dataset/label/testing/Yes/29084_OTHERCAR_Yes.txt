            As the kids grow older, let's face it, there is no need for a van anymore.  So when my kids turned eleven and fourteen, I knew that and SUV is most likely a good decision.

Now..you have probably heard from a whole lot of people that Land Rovers are uncomfortable and cheaply made. Ten years ago, I might have agreed with them, but I'm willing to bet that those people haven't set foot in a Land Rover in at least two to three years.  The new Land Rover Discovery Series II and the Range Rover are amazing. Ride quality is superb. It doesn't just feel like a truck ride anymore.  It's starting to feel like a car!

The Outside has a lot of British appeal to it. The Range Rover is not extremely high and not incredibly long or wide.  In my opinion, if you are not looking for a heavy duty truck and you are not looking for a car either, this is almost a perfect match.

Engine: The Range Rover comes in two different models. The 4.0 SE, and the 4.6 HSE.  The only real difference is the engine, one being 4.0 liters and the other 4.6 liters. The 4.0 has 188 horse power and the 4.6 has 222 horse power. The 4.6 has a greater amount of torque as well.  I purchased a 4.0 because although the difference may not seem much, the cost is. A 4.0 with options might go up to $59,000, while a 4.6 might go to a whopping $69,000! both also hold a 24.6 gallon fuel tank.
