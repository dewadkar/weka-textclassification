            I have experienced most all of the SONY digital cameras since they first hit the market five-six years ago.  The Communication Technology program I direct began with the Sony MVC FD 71 then we moved on to the MVC FD 91, and we also have the MVC 1000 CD ROM digital camera.  Each camera was a step up in hands on technology.

Just recently, we lost the MVC FD 71 to an instance of theft.  The student responsible for caring for the camera was also responsible to replace it with a model as close as possible to the MVC FD 71.  What they came in the door with was the MVC FD73.   It is comparable to the MVC FD71 with a couple of exceptions.

The similarities between the two cameras is the 10X Zoom lens which is very easy to operate.  There is a quick access FD Drive 2X which records the picture onto the floppy.  And the standards of this class of Sony digitals is pretty much the same in terms of how the flash operates and how to set up the picture effects. The floppy accessibility is also the same. And the Zoom control operates the same as well.

One of the things that is different that I like is the battery access.  The slide of the battery lid is much more durable than the MVC FD 71.  

One of the other things that is different that I do not care for is the LCD screen.  On the MVC FD 71 model, the LCD screen was adjustable and operated on a durable type hinge.  The movable LCD screen on the MVC FD 71 allowed for the picture taker to adjust the screen.   

That is not so with the MVC FD 73.  The LCD screen is built right into the camera.  Because the picture taker is not allowed to adjust this LCD screen, they are going to have an extremely difficult time taking pictures in the sun or actually in any kind of extremely well lit environment.

Regardless of the differences in the camera, just because the Sony  Mavica  digital camera series has been out on the market for several years doesn�t mean it still not a great product!   If the consumer aim is to purchase a camera to take digital pictures to transmit over the Internet or take to the local Wal Mart to create the form of development desired, any of the Sony Mavica cameras are great and affordable.

I personally don�t even look at cameras that are not Sony.  Sony invented the technology therefore they are the ones who have continually upgraded the technology in the later models.  The other cameras, in my opinion are simply knock offs and they are harder to find service for.  

I know this to be true because one of my friends did not follow his good friend�s Sony advice and bought one of those other copy cats because it was �cheaper.�   While out and about, he dropped the camera.  Digital cameras don�t take to dropping very well.  Usually the shutter becomes the injured party.  He couldn�t find a place to send the camera to be repaired because the places I use to service and repair my arsenal of Sony cameras told him they wouldn�t touch that camera with a ten foot pole. I told him it looked like he had an awfully expensive wall hanging or doorstop depending how he wanted to reuse that �cheap� camera.  The next camera he bought was a SONY!  Isn�t it nice to know older people can learn?

When I need a camera repaired�with given that my camera arsenal is used by kids, I simply contact Sony, tell the symptoms and they tell me where to send it and they forward a paid UPS tag to pay for the shipping.   

Over all, though, for the price the student actually got off very well.  The initial MVC FD 71 was purchased for $895.00.  The student purchased MVC-FD 73 got off paying $365.00. 

Isn�t that student lucky the program doesn�t require the student to make a dollar on the dollar replacement purchase!!!!

Take my word on it, SONY digitals are the best buys for the money you will ever spend on a digital camera!  Select the model you want based on your camera experience.
