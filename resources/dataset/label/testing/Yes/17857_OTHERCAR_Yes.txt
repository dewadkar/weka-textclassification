            As a auto mech at Joseph Neri Chevrolet,I see a lot of cars and trucks of
verying years makes and models!Every time I see the lot guys wash and wax
one of the Indigo Blue Metallic 2000 Blazers I have to sigh!!! The color is so breath taking it's unreal.Depending on the model that you choose
weather its the two door or the four door the content packages will very.
I personaly like the TBZ model for the amount of options that come standard!I could sit here and list all the options but I will let you go 
see them for yourself.Of course I will have to mention the four wheel disk brake and abs system is very relible and the other safety features
are outstanding!I could go on about the custum seats and the six or seven differnt rims that you can get, but why just go to your nearest chevy dealer and test drive one for your self.<br><br>
