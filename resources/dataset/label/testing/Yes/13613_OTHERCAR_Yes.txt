                 I bought a 2000 Chevrolet S-10 4WD at this time for 1 reason, 0% financing for the term of the loan offered by Chevrolet.  I feel that the S-10 with the wide stance is an attractive truck that does not look like the small S-10 boxes that Chevrolet puts out.  True, it's basically the same truck, it just looks better. 
     The wide stance S-10 is I guess a ZR2 version.  The frame has been modified slightly to accept bigger tires and provide the wide stance.  I read the review regarding the S-10 feeling like a car ride.  You don't get that with this truck.  It feels like all truck.  The step up into the cab is a step up.  If you are not able bodied you would at least need running boards or some other method to get in and out.  After getting into the truck I'm happy with what's there.  This is an LS version which has; air, AM/FM Cassette, CD player, cruise, tilt wheel, heated power side view mirrors, power locks and windows, remote keyless entry, and speed sensitive stereo volume.  The headlights activate by themselves, daytime running as well as night time full activation.
     The controls are easily to use, with the exception of the windshield wipers and cruise control, which are on the turn signal knob.  At times they are hidden behind the steering wheel and I find that I have to look for them.  Other controls are easy for me to reach and convenient.
The 4WD drive buttons are just to the right of the steering wheel, the lights are automatic, the stereo has a dial for volume, easier than my Alpine push buttons in my Explorer.  Everything else is right where you'd expect it to be.
  There is also a third door for access to the extended cab.  The extended cab is more or less a glorified storage area.  My 16 year old daughter sat back there and said it was okay but I can't imagine being there for any amount of time.  I also hear that riding in these extended cabs is unsafe, as a rear end collision endangers this passenger as the truck collapses.  With this passenger sitting sideways, I can imagine that an accident could cause serious problems.  I have found the area useful for storing tools that I would not want to put in the bed area.
The seats are comfortable for all rides that I have been on with it (1 1/2 hours max.).  The drivers seat has an adjustable lumbar support.  I would think that this is more than you can expect from a small pickup truck.
     This truck has a poor turning radius.  The ride is sometimes rough (truck like) but the larger tires and lifted truck provide excellent vision.  The extended cab portion helps expand the field of vision as well.  This truck seems to be using more gas than I would expect but the V-6 engine seems to have all of the power I need.
     I would recommend this truck to someone who likes the looks of a truck and expects a truck ride.  It's no passenger car and it is basically a two seater as well.  It does serve well as a truck.<br><br>
