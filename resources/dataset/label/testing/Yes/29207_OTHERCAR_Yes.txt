             No, I didn't buy a Dodge Intrepid and I didn't have a long-term lease. I rented one for a week on a trip to Chicago, and was quite pleased with it. It has plenty of power, at least for the not-exactly-mountainous territory of northeast Illinois, although the accelerator took a heavier-than-I-normally- use foot to get going.

 The Intrepid I rented was silver and was quite a good-looking vehicle. There was a lot of room in front for my wife and myself, and there was adequate trunk space for a week's worth of luggage. The heat in the vehicle came up quickly and was more than adequate(an important consideration in January in the Great Lakes area).
 
 I drove the Intrepid both on expressways(although NOT in rush hours!) and in heavy stop-and-go driving both in the city and the suburbs. Although I didn't actually clock the gas mileage, I estimated it to be around 25 miles per gallon, which to me is certainly acceptable. The car accelerated and braked well as needed.

 If there was any problem that I wished could be fixed with the Intrepid, it was a common Chrysler product difficulty, the poor visibility of the gear indicator. There's one directly in front of the steering wheel, virtually invisible to me, as well as a very faintly-visible one next to the shift stick on the floor. More than once I tried to shut off the engine in Reverse instead of Park because of this problem. One problem I had anticipated was the adjustment to an automatic transmission as both my vehicles are 5-speed stick shifts. This really wasn't much of a problem, and also when I got home I didn't stall my engine once by forgetting the clutch!

  I'm not in a position to buy a new Dodge Intrepid right now, but if I were looking for another car and the price was right, I'd certainly consider buying a used one. It's really a nice ride!
