            I bought my 1998 Dodge Dakota 4cyl. in November of 1997.  I have enjoyed my truck for the most part, although it has needed a few repairs here and there.  The repair that has been the most bothersome is due to a flaw in the bolts holding the exhaust manifold to the engine.  When I first experienced problems with these bolts, the service department at the local Dodge dealership had a large amount of difficulty finding the problem.  Second time around, the problem was diagnosed immediately!
The truck is somewhat underpowered (although it is sufficient to tow my boat).  It does seem to lag when the Air Conditioning is turned on.
I bought this truck to satisfy my need for a vehicle that is both reliable and useful.  On both of these points it has done rather well.
I thoroughly enjoy its responsiveness and handling, but wish that the repair that was done on it would not continue to occur.
I would recommend that if you are considering buying a Dakota, that you overbuy on engine size, as the cost is rather insignificant, and there are plenty of larger engines in the Dakota lineup.
I will be buying another Dakota soon....I want the 4 door, and the big engine next time though!<br><br>
