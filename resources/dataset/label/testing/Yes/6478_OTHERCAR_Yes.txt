            When I walked in to the showroom, I was sold.  Just on looks alone, I was ready to fork over the cash.  The rims made this car.  I never really considered the C-class fully because of the generic look of the car with its stock rims.  From there I moved to the interior of the car.  All aluminum side inserts and dash inserts look gaudy at first, but grew on me after a while.  

Engine performance is good enough but could use a 260  hp engine.  Which I hear is coming in the 06 redesign.  But its very responsive and fun to drive.  I have the v6 and 4matic really guzzle gas.  I can get about 350-400 miles on a full tank.  The car apparently adjusts in consumption based on driving habits.  I change between laid back and aggresive driving from one turn to the next, so that may be the reason for such high gas consumption.  

The steering feels a bit stiff at first, and I didnt like it during my intial drive.  But now that I have driven it, I see that steering response and feel really give you the best control of this car.  The horn on the steering wheel is hard to reach if you like to push the horn with your thumbs.  The instrument cluster for the computer menus, radio, telephone, volume, etc are in the way.  Must take your hand off the wheel to push down on the horn.  Not Good.  

Audio system no real complaints in sound.  I dont have the GPS Navi, I bought a car in stock with the Bose with tape and glove box cd changer.  I wish they could put the changer right in the dash itself, but atleast its not in the trunk.  

I have automatic transmission with the tipronic type feature.  I call it tiptronic type feature, because its not a pure tiptronic.  If you like the tip in the vw passat, you will not like this one.  It good to hold a low hear when take a hard turn or going up hills, and the fifth gear is D instead of going to 5th.  BOO!

The trunk space is huge for the car, cant imagine the space by looking from the outside.  

I have the leather inserts package, but I cant complain, enough leather for me.  Seats are firm for sporty driving, but very comfortable.  Easy adjustment via the automatic controls.  The car will keep your seat and mirror position memorized based on the three memory settings that can be programed.  Each key stores a different memory of seating positions as well.  Nice feature for 2 drivers.  Mirror will tild downward while reversing.  The seats and steering wheel move out of my way when getting out, and move back in to position once I start the car.  I can even retract the seat head cushions in the back, via a button in the dash.  Great when the passangers put them up and you cant see past them when they leave the car.  Electronics sun shade is pointless to me, but still cool thing to show off.  Has little hooks for car seats, which I think are requireed by law, but I dont need them so who cares.  

Dual climate control was extremely useful, especially with the opposite sex.  I like it cooler, and the woman I take around seem to like it warmer.  We can have the best of both worlds.  Like the charcoal filter button, which is pretty nice, when its stinky inside or out and you forget to do the recirculating function in time.  Great tunnel mode feature built in.  Hold down recirculation, and the windows and sun roof close.  

Get two keys with the car.  No more key to insert in to the steering column.  Now its a digital key that you stil have to insert.  Each electonic key can be pointed at the door handle ir reader and hold unlock button and the sun roof and windows all open.  Hold it down again, and everything retracts.  I like that feature.  Little manual key can be take out of the transponder key, in case your battery dies.  

I have the sports package.  So the rims in that package are hard to keep clean.  The aluminum trim may be hard to clean over time, but Im not sure yet.  

The rims and tire package came free in the sport version, so that was great, as did the interior styling. Free meaning the normal car, costs the same as the sport, so why not sport.  

I really love this car.  I didnt want to get some japanese car that will fall apart in an accident.  No amount of airbag built in can save me from a h2 knocking in to you.  Didnt want to go for the bmw just becaus ethe ride is better, but the exterior and interior looks get dated a year after purchase.  Didnt want the audi, though it would have been a second choice after the class for me.  Like the power of the g35 sedan, but didnt like the looks of the nissan heritage.  Id rather buy the maxima then the infiniti, cept the g35, better then the z350. For me atleast.  

I come from a family thats had over 40 mercedes.  Ive driven almost every type of Mercedes, and Ive grown to love the timless looks and quality.  Though the quality of their cars has dropped significantly in their attempt to compete with japanese market, I took the risk.  We'll see in 5 years if I was right in my choice.  

I got the v6, automatic, 4wd, sport package.  Woudl like t have split folding rear seat and navi command center, but the dealer didnt have those options in their stock cars.  BOO!  But I got the features that are the most important things, I can deal without the extras till my next car purchase.  I like this car, and wouldnt consider anything else its in class, not even its brother the c320 4matic without sport.  The car has everything for me at this stage in my life.  Not too much and not too little, so Im happy.
