            I bought this vehicle for my seventeen year old daughter.  I originally bought her a Jeep Cherokee (see 'Sweet Sixteen') and learned in one year that teenagers spend more time in their vehicles than at home.  She put 18,000 miles on her Jeep in 10 months and I panicked!!  How was I going to deal with her gas consumption??  Easy, I bought a VW diesel.  My daughter is getting 50 mpg consistently!!!  Diesel fuel is readily available, and is currently cheaper than regular gasoline.  In doing my research for a good car for her, I learned that many VW owners expect in excess of 200,000 miles from their VW diesels.  I listened to them!


When test driving this vehicle, I was amazed at the smooth ride.  I was a Saab owner, and particularly fussy about the ride of my vehicle.  This VW surpassed the comfort of my Saab in smoothness.  The seats aren't as comfortable as the Saab, but not uncomfortable.  The vehicle is still new, so maybe a breaking in period will solve this.  The back seat leg room is okay, not great. 

I've heard good and bad things about the sound system.  Her model came equipped with the Monsoon system and 6 CD stacker.  I bought the vehicle and surprised my daughter, so I did not notice that the cd player was not in the vehicle.  I called the dealership and asked why I paid for something that wasn't installed and they told me to look in the trunk and call them back.  Yup, it is quite cleverly tucked into one side of the trunk - I hadn't even noticed it.  It is a little inconvenient to have to pull over to change the cd's if you're not happy with your six that are loaded.  The sound itself surprised me.  I expect to have to equip a vehicle with a decent sound system and stash the stock equipment.  Not so in this case, the 8 speaker system is quite good.

I should also mention that much thought was put into the interior design.  There is a place for EVERYTHING.  There are all sorts of little places to stash change, make up, wallets, you name it!  

This car came with great rims and tires, they really complete the look of this car.

This sporty little number is great for my daughter.  It is equipped with side air bags, as well as two in front.  This makes for less worrying:-)  The vehicle looks much nicer than most small sedans, it's curves and chrome make it fun to look at.  I feel good knowing that this vehicle will see my daughter through her senior year in high school as well as her four+ years in college.  <br><br>
