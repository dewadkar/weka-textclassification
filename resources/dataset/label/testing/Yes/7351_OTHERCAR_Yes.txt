            Mercedes-Benz has always been senomonis with excellence in engineering.  I am a student at Washington State University, and I studying Mechanical Engineering.  The feeling by engineering professors and students alike is that this engine is the best diesel ever made bar none.  Mercedes have always been at least 10 years ahead of all of the bargain cars.  I am also a part time mechanic, and they truth is older Mercedes are more reliable than many new cars.  The great thing about used Mercedes is they are usually kept in good condition, because hey it is a Mercedes, and they last and last.  In fact the car that ran the longest was a 1955 190D Mercedes coming in at over 1.5 million miles.  Mercedes made the first combustion engine driven automobile and have keep with the tradition of excellence.  The new lines of Mercedes are amazing, and believe me they are the foremost automobile company for engineering.  BMW never has and never will hold a candle to their betters, Mercedes Benz Forever.
