            I have owned my 1999 New Beetle since April, 1999 and I just love it.  The TDI engine is clean and quiet-most people don't believe it's a diesel!  I get on average 52 miles to the gallon (I have put almost 22000 miles on the car in the seven months I've been driving it, all on the highway).  I get many compliments on the style of the car itself, which I enhanced by having peace signs, smileys and flowers painted all over it.  

The one problem I had with it seemed serious but it turned out to be an easy fix.  I'd be driving the car and for no reason it would just cut out-not stall, the engine was still running-but I'd press the gas pedal and the car would not respond, just going slower and slower til I was able to pull over.  I'd start it, and the engine turned right over, but the car just wouldn't go.  It was intermittent, and it took the dealership nine days in the shop to figure out the problem--a loose connection in the power supply.  The car is running beautifully again.

Face it, people buy the Beetle because of the emotions it invokes.  It's a fun car!  Practically speaking, it's larger inside than you'd think, it's very economical (diesel version, anyway), but it does have a rather large turning radius and HUGE blind spots, so it takes some getting used to.  You'll meet some interesting people when you own one.  I find I have to add extra time onto any trip I make to allow for people stopping to ask about the car and tell me their Beetle stories.<br><br>
