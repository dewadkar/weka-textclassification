            This camera just continues to amaze and stun me. The specs were everything I was looking for, the quality of the photographs exceeded my expectations. I shoot mostly at ASA 64-100, and these noise issues are not evident (I have firmware ver 78 which is on all the new cams sold and seems to be a difference from my reading on the net). Every setting is manually controlled, but when my wife wants to take a picture, full Point and Shoot gives beautiful shots. The flash is strong, compared to most digicam flashes, and with the 1.8 lens, indoor shots come out beautiful. Shutter lag, a problem with any autofocus camera and especially all digicams, is equal to or better than most I have tried before buying. The underwater case availability is an added plus, and we have been taking great diving pictures. Also lets me comfortably take the C-5050 to the beach and pool without fear of splashes and sand from kids.

Features I didn't pay attention to, but have been more useful than I imagined include:

Remote Control. - Get every set, including yourself. No more running back to your spot with a timer. Plus take a few shots to make sure you got a good one, all while everyone still in place.

Movie Mode - Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would actually use a movie mode on a digi-cam - that is why I spent all that money on a DV video camcorder, right? 2 things - Kids will always do something that can be caught better with sound and video than photographs and second, underwater photography with some video of the dive is a great bonus that we are using more and more. Get that 1 GB compact flash card. Granted the video is not DV quality, but in these circumstances something is better than nothing.
 
My Mode is great - I have a setting for fill in flash, setting the flash EV down -1.3 EV - gives better fill than a full flash, I also have a diving My Mode, for better color correction underwater.

Super Macro Mode - When I wanted to do Macro photography before, I would use an add on lens to get the shots. The Super Macro Mode let you get within about an inch to take great macro shots of insects and flowers.

This is a camera that has not disappointed me in any way. You can't go wrong with this one if you are enthusiastic about photography. It really is too much for someone that just wants a point and shoot and does not understand F stops, shutter or aperture priority, etc. BUT if you are an advanced beginner or budding photographer, this is the camera for you.
