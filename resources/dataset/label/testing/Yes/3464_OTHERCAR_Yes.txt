            Not so long ago, even an avid auto enthusiast would be hard pressed to point out the differences between a Chevy, Buick, Pontiac or Oldsmobile.  Today it's a whole different ball game.  Pontiac has firmly established itself as the technology and performance division of General Motors.  The 2000 Bonneville fits the formula perfectly.  

The first thing you'll notice about the Bonneville is the styling.  Love it or hate it, it's bold.  Compared to the likes of Honda Accord &amp; Toyota Camry, the Bonneville stands out like a sore thumb.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  With its dropped nose, and jacked up tail, the Bonneville looks much sportier than most in its class.  Styling is subjective, there's really no right or wrong (except gold trim, which is always wrong).  One thing is certain, the Bonneville isn't boring.

Inside you'll find a wide array of buttons and switches, and yes they all do something.  Seats are comfortable, but sporty.  Gauges are large, clear and easy to read.  After dark the Bonneville's interior glows like a jet fighter cockpit, surrounding the driver with all sorts of controls and gadgets, including an auto-down function for both the driver and passenger front windows.  One complaint is that the low, swoopy roof-line doesn't give much head room, especially when fitted with the optional sunroof.   Rear seat leg room is fair, this is one area the Camry tops most other cars in its class.   Also on the down side, the Bonneville lacks folding rear seats, and gives you a center pass through hole instead.  The pass-through hole is plenty big enough for Skis or a few pieces of lumber, but lacks the usefulness of fold down seats. Up front the drivers compartment doesn't have enough useful storage spaces. 

There is only one way to describe the engine - SMOOTH.  Lexus like smoothness, yes really.  Unlike a Lexus or Toyota, or even a Honda, the Bonneville makes a nice little exhaust growl when stepping on the gas. The non-supercharged 3.8L V-6 delivers plenty of power and torque. The 3.8L is rated at 205 hp, but is so torque happy,  you'd swear there's 20 more hp than Pontiac claims. The supercharged SSEi gives an incredible 240 hp and 280 lb ft of torque.   Acceleration is brisk, and the automatic transmission shifts seamlessly.  

Ride and handling are near perfect for a car this size, and again top Camry and Accord.  No squeaks or rattles, even on rough roads. Minimal body roll when cornering inspires spirited driving.  As with any sporty car, the ride over rough roads can be a little bumpy, but it's a worthwhile trade off.  16in wheels and tires help keep the Bonneville stuck to the road, 17in on the SSEi. The Bonneville's agility feels downright European at times.

Like most American cars these days, Bonneville gives excellent value.  The middle level trim SE gives you such luxuries as climate control, driving lights, traction control, 4 wheel disc brakes,  V-6 power, cruise control and much much more.  Sure the fire breathing SSEi is the hottest Pontiac out there, but the SE will give you more than adequate power along with many amenities all for around $24,500.  There is also an entry level $22,000 version, but the SE has all the options 90% of buyers will want, and have come to expect.

If you're shopping for a mid-size sedan, but are tired  of the bland choices, the Bonneville is a worthy alternative.  Bold styling, super smooth V-6, and lots of amenities; it  all adds up to a great value.  The Bonneville is not perfect, but it is worth a look.<br><br>
