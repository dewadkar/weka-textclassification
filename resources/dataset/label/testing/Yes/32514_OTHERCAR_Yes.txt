            Summary:
I am extremely satisfied with this automobile & this is coming from a tough critic. 
Overall if you like to drive cars, I believe this is the best all around luxury car on the market. 
I was very worried about the power this car offered based on some of the reading I did prior to my purchase. The worrying was for naught. This car gets up to speed quickly with no hesitation. It is not a vette, but acceleration is better than most cars.

Strengths:
Bose option is great. 
Controls well placed even if the ESP & hazards take up prime space. 
Cargo, head & leg room are above avg. 
The car rides very comfortably. 
I have been in quieter cars but this one is up there with the top. 
Best looking wagon out there. 
Excellent handling especially for a wagon. 
Front view is clear & open. 
Easy to find a good driving position. 
Highway gas mileage is better than I expected. 
Xenon headlights are awesome. I never had this feature in any of my other cars & I will never go without it again. (I donï¿½t think Audi has a better system than any other manufacturer with Xenon Lights, but I am not sure). 
Fit & Finish - Perfect

Weaknesses:
Glove box & center console are way too SMALL! 
No steering wheel memory attached to memory seats & mirrors. 
No quick 1 button shutoff for the A/C/heat. 
Cupholders are small (They work great though). 
Defogger takes more time than other cars I have driven. 
Cruise control location takes some getting used to. 
No full spare. 
Headlights don't turn off automatically. 
Windshield wipers are not auto sensing. 
Gas mileage on the streets is weak.
