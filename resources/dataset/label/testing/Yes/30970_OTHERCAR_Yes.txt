            If you don't mind the boxy appearance (which I actually kind of like), the Astro Cargo Van is a fine combination of power, space, and accessory features.  As far as power is concerned, among minivans the Astro (or it's GMC Safari cousin) is the top performing vehicle available.  When used to pull a trailer this machine feels as sturdy and substantial as a full size truck, yet is even more useful when maneuvering, parking, and backing up because of it's snub-nose design.  Compared to other minivans, the full-sized interior can actually hold almost as much stuff as some of the older full size vans.  Chevy's current range of accessories, such as AC, CD player, and improved seats make these machines fun and comfortable in long distance driving.  Overall, I find the Astro escapes the pitfall that catches most minivans, which is that it's not just a &quot;Maxi-Wagon&quot; pretending to be a van.<br><br>
