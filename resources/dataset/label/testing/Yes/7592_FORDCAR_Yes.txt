            The Ford Expedition was the first SUV I've ever had in my lifetime, and I've never been so satisfied with a car. We first bought the car in 1998 so trips up to Lake Tahoe would be easier in the winter, since we wouldnt have to put the chains on the wheels. 

The car handles VERY well and the turning circle is magnificent for a large vehicle. ITs easy to maneuver in city streets and go zoomin' on insterstate freeways. Now exactly WHY do I love the expedition so much? Thats a dumb question! Its because you tower above all the small cars and I feel mighty and powerful... also the advantage that if someone is driving poorly and decides to cut you off, chances are their car will get more damage than the expedition.

There were a few problems with our expedition, though. There was something wrong with the engine. We found this out the hard way. New years eve 1998, and we are in Tahoe on our way back to the lodge from a party. Why yes, our car breaks down. Stranded on the side of the road, we spent our new years watching the tow truck guy lift the truck onto the big flatbed.

After two more engines, the car was up and running again (this took 2 months). The warranty handled all the money, and ford paid for all of the engines. So basically, we didn't spend a dime. Ford also paid for the $200 out of $300 it took for the tow company to tow our car back to the bay area. 

Besides that, the car is great. Leather seats, 6 cd holder, amazing bass and tremble for the sound system, its a great car to haul your friends around in. Whether your going up to the snow, or to the inner city - it always drives well and smoothly. And its guaranteed a cozy ride.

So I, as a proud owner of an expedition, I recommend this car to all types of people. Whether you are the business, country, or trendy type -- its great for it all. Hauling your co workers to a meeting, going to the snow to ski/snowboard, or just go and hang out with friends. So if your looking into SUV, please check out the expedition -- for its worth the test drive!<br><br>
