            If you've read any of my reviews or my profile, you know I <b>LOVE</B> my Jeeps.  Even my '97 which I wasn't extremely fond of is way ahead of any other vehicle on the face of the Earth.  By all account, I like my '93 better than any of the others I've owned to date, but my '94 is a close second!

<B>Body</B>

It's still in the realm of the square headlights... they didn't change the body style back until '97.  But, for some reason, this Jeep was much more fun to put a 3" body lift on and tool around on my 32x11x50's.  

<B>Engine</B>

Mine had an inline 6 cylinder engine which could run circles around my '97, and with the big knobby tires I had on it, we could go just about anywhere in the woods you could possibly want!  I have had NO PROBLEMS with my engine... in fact, the only mechanical repairs I have had to make to date deals with the clutch.  I have over 150,000 miles on my engine and I'm still running fine... no oils leaks even!

<b>Gas</B>

Actually not that bad... when you compare Jeep to Jeep.  But if you go into this purchase comparing Jeep to say a Honda Civic Hatchback, the Civic is gonna win hands down.  I average about 17 miles to the gallon with city tires and about 14 MPG with my big 'ole tires on.  If you are the paranoid type, you can buy a gas can holder and keep gas with you at all times.

<B>Practicality</B>

Pshea...right!  Please don't tell me you are expecting to buy a Jeep for <I>Practical</I> purposes!!!  I am gonna die laughing!  There is NO room for groceries when you go shopping.  You'd have to buy an after market locking trunk if you expect to store things safely.  The windows are easy to slash so forget expensive stereos and stuff (although I do have a great system in mine).  And in the winter you freeze your butay off, in the wet they leak, and in the summer you're gonna fry!

<B>Conclusion</B>

You're wondering why I would so highly reccomend such an impractical vehicle?  Plainly put, they're FUN, FUN, FUN til the day the rainy season begins!  I love the bumpy ride, the wind in my hair and the loudness of the ride!  It is not your typical "Girly" vehicle (my '97 came close to being a Barbie Jeep though)... it is a FUN vehicle for those of us belonging to the Peter Pan club or the Hunt Club of America!
