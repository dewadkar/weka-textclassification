            I recently purchased the Dimera through Ebay. As an avid seller I figured this would save all of that scanner time. I payed about 25.00 less than the 120.00 they were going for at their main site. But for their price this is a good buy. It's nothing fancy, no screen on the back and no huge amount of storage. For the price this goes for I should hope no one is naive eneugh to expect more. I mean a good digital camera goes as high as 1200.00. 

The Dimera takes a very good picture on fine. The normal setting is not that great, but for some instances it will do. The clarity on the fine setting is amazing for this grade of camera. The flash is automatic and sets to the amount of sunlight. The software that comes with it is less than lousy, I recomend you use the photo program on your computer if you have one. I use picture perfect and love it.

Down load time is very fast, however you should really by the ac adapter as downloading eats the batteries up big time. The Batteries cost 12.00 a piece and the ac adapter cost's 25.00. It will pay for it's self. Very good instuction manual for you virgin digital camera users as I was.

I want to reiterate, if you buy this camera, do not expect more than what 125.00 is going to buy. You won't get a camera with all the options for this price. If you want a simple camera to use, and put good pictures on the web, this is the camera for you. If you sell at ebay, this is perfect for getting your item out there.
