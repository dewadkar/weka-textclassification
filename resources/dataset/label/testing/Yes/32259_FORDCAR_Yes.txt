            We recently purchased a 2001 Windstar SE. I was one of those minivan hater's in the past.  I was never, never, NEVER, going to get a minivan.  Well, I've completely changed my mind.  The past year I've been dreaming of owning one of these babies!  We have two children and a dog and we are planning a journey cross country not to mention my daughter and carrying all her friends around on a daily basis.  I could never dream of driving cross country in a CAR or SUV.  Our trip will be comfortable and enjoyable!

We chose the SE model with the captains chairs, dual air and front and back media controls, six disk in dash CD player - yeah baby!! and dual sliding doors.  The van is beautiful dark navy blue with chrome trim.  It really is classy looking.  We decided to buy the tv console aftermarket.  Here is a tip: You can get a larger screen tv and at half the price the dealer charges.  We got ours at BJ's wholesale club.  This was a wise investment for the kids. They are happily quiet and enjoy the ride. Just pop in a movie and voila....! they are happy!

Some of the features I love about our van is the dual sliding doors, the keyless entry system and alarm, the large trunk space for all kinds of things.  I can fit my stroller plus two friends strollers in the back with ease.  I also like the dual outlet plugs.  I have a space for my cell phone and for the tv console to plug in.  I love the heated mirrors and power adjustable seat.  The bench seat in the back is removable and there is also a luggage rack on top.  The pedals are also adjustable (kind of a wierd option I've never encountered!) and there are dual airbags and standard 4 wheel ABS.  There is also intermittent wiper's front and back.  And another thing I like is the privacy glass in back.  No one can look inside the van to see what's in it.

The van performs great.  The acceleration is good and the braking system is good as well.  The van handles very nice and smooth and is a nice comfortable ride.  

The only thing I did not like about the Windstar is the exterior color choices.  I knew I wanted dark navy blue but I was not at all fond of any of the other color choices they had.  They consist of two horrible colors of green, some pukey silver color, red, black, and a few other awful colors.  Dark blue was the only color I was going to go with and if they didn't have it, we were going to order our van.  Thankfully they had two on the lot and with the options we were looking for.  The other thing that took some getting used to was going from an SUV to a minivan.  The size difference was a little overwhelming at first but I'm slowly getting used to it.

I highly recommend the Windstar, we shopped around for 2 to 3 months before taking the plunge. Some other vans we considered are the Honda Odyssey and the Dodge Caravan.  We quickly scratched those off the list when we took a look at the Windstar.  It comes in several different models, the LX, the SE Sport, the SE, and the SEL limited.  We went with the middle of the road model because it had all the options we wanted without going broke on stupid things like dual colored trim, heated seats, etc..  We were lucky to get an excellent interest rate at 0.9 percent plus cash back.  Check with your dealer to see if you qualify or if these programs are still available in your area.  

In closing I"d like to say I highly recommend this vehicle.  WE've owned it for 2 months now and I couldn't be happier!
