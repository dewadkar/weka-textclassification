            I now add my name to all of the others who have discovered the Land Rover Discovery and have give it an enthusiastic two thumbs up.  We previously owned a Chevy Blazer...bad idea.  At 50,000 miles, we had already replaced 3 air conditioning compressors and the water pump and radiator blew!  Well we didn't have to be brain surgeons to know that if these types of problems were occurring at 50,000 miles, we were in for big problems down the road.  So, we started our search for a new vehicle.  I love SUV's so we were able to narrow the search.  I cannot and will not ever be able to drive a mini-van so for our family, an SUV is practical.  We started at the Toyota store and after coming away feeling abused by the rude salespeople, we decided that the Forerunner was like driving the Blazer all over again...very uninspired.  So, we moved on to Isuzu...not bad but didn't set my world on fire.  On to Lexus....too small.  Infiniti...pretty nice, getting closer.  Finally, we rolled in to the Land Rover store.  Not only were we treated like gold, but the car fit like a glove from the second I sat in it.  It doesn't drive like a truck but more like a car.  The seats are incredibly comfortable which was a necessity since my husband has a testy back problem.  There's plenty of room for not only kids but luggage and two dogs. All of the controls are easy to reach and convenient and I love having two sunroofs. Having children, the Land Rover's safety record and features were important.  This truck is one of the safest vehicles on the road today.  This is a truck for anyone who appreciates what a good ride should be like.  If you don't care about how you get there or you don't give a second thought to enjoying your vehicle, then go buy another SUV.  Plus, it looks different from anything else on the road.  How nice not to lose your car in a sea of duplicate looking vehicles!  If you want safety, comfort, space and a satisfying drive, then get thee to the Land Rover dealership!! <br><br>
