            I bought a 1994 Toyota Celica ST used in 1996 because I had always liked the looks of the car.  This was the best car I ever owned.  The Celica is the sturdiest and safest car I have owned.  I was hit 2 years ago on interstate and my front seat broke instantly on impact. The car saved my life!  You would have thought it was just a small collision by looking at the car.  Another great thing about the car was the handling.  Don't try this at home :), but I never took any curve slower then 40 mph and never once but the dust!!!  It held curves better then any other sports car I have been in.  The gas mileage is great!! It averaged around 31 mpg in town and 36 - 38 mpg on interstate.  The only downfall to this car was the head room.  Luckily, I am a short person but someone with any height to them would probably be rubbing the roof.  I would not recommend it for a family car because there is not much room overhead or for your legs in the back seat.  For everyone else, this car is great and highly recommended.  I never did any maintenance to this car except the routine oil changes and tires and it had almost 90,000 miles on it when I sold it, running and looking like new.  That was my biggest mistake. (I brag on the gas and went and got an SUV, never again!)  I wish I still had that celica.  For anyone looking for a great ride, sturdiness and great gas mileage, this is your car!<br><br>
