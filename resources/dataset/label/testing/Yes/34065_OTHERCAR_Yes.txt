            I purchased my 1996 Plymouth Neon brand new.  I considered the Neon along with the Pontiac Sunfire and Chevy Cavalier.  I am a big guy and comfort was paramount in making my final decision.  After test driving all three cars, my clear choice was the Neon.  I have plenty of room to snuggle in for a nice drive.  Plenty of head room, leg room and side room.  I was also concerned about comfortability of passengers.  Again, the Neon was tops.  I found it much easier to get in and out of my Neon than with the other cars.

It is amazing to think that my Neon is a compact care.  When inside, I feel like I'm in a large care.  It is only when I get out and stand back for a look do I realize that I am driving a &quot;small&quot; car.  I wouldn't have it any other way though.  Having underground parking at home, getting in and out would be much more difficult with a larger car.

Since buying my Neon, I have had only two problems with it.  One is on-
going.  When it is humid outside, I find that the shocks or struts or some related item begins to make odd squeaky noises.  Having been checked out, no one seems able to determine any problems.  Drive ability hasn't been affected.  Just recently, I had to have a major engine gasket replaced due to a slow oil leak.  It was covered by extended warranty.
Those are the only two issues I have had in almost four years of ownership.

I still love my Plymouth Neon and intend on buying another Neon when my current automobile needs to be traded in.
