            We looked at a few vans, and were seriously considering the Honda because a few friends have them. I have a 98 Accord, which hasn't been the perfect car that a Honda is supposed to be. Most dealers did not even have a Honda to drive let alone buy when we were looking. 
 
We shopped in October of 2002, and the Chevy dealer still had a few 2002 models left. We wanted leather - trust me - with little kids leather is actually tons better than cloth!!! The dealer had a couple 2002 LTs with leather and all options other than AWD and the DVD.

So I now have a 2002 Venture LT with CD, Cruise, Power driver seat, leather, captain's chairs, rear AC, rear stereo, OnStar, dual power sliding doors, remote keyless, traction control, etc etc.

I also have a GM credit card, and the cash back, combined with the end-of-model-year incentives etc. had us out the door well under $24,000. A similarly equipped Honda would have been about $32,000.

We have now had the van for nine months and have about 8,000 miles on it.

First the cons - The horn honks on occasion for no reason. It has done this about four times in 9 months. The prop rod clip for the hood broke. The rear seat is a real pain to take out, it wants to open up all the time when you move it. And when I need to put a battery in it, I better plan a whole day to do it - very packed in there.

The lights cannot be turned off. This is a problem when you are going to a drive-in or somewhere where you do not want your lights on. If you release the parking brake and it is dark, all your lights are on - period. No way to turn them off at all. Not a big deal, but wacky.

Also the bins, compartments etc. are all far inferior to those found on Japanese models. They do not open and close as well, are less useful and just not as well engineered as ones I have seen on several foreign vehicles.

The rear seat folds flat with the rear package tray installed, but it is not nearly as nice as the Honda design which either leaves you with a deep trunk (seat up) or a flat floor (seat down). I removed the package tray thing, because I like having a slightly lower, smoother "trunk" area.

The pros - This van was lots cheaper than the Honda. It rides great and gets great mileage. We average about 23-25 MPG all the time. The seats are very comfy, and being able to put tall water bottles in the door compartments is nice. 

The controls are logical and easy to use. I especially like being able to shut off all the interior lighting via a ceiling switch. Also if someone accidentally leaves on any interior light, it will turn off once the vehicle is parked for a few minutes. Being able to open and close the side doors from the overhead console buttons is nice too.
