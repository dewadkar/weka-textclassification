            <b>Background:</b>
==========
I purchased my '96 Nissan Maxima SE in the Fall of 2001.  It is my second car, my first being a '95 Toyota 4Runner <a href="/auto-review-271D-3AADE628-3A3045BD-prod3">(read my review here)</a>.  I bought the Maxima from the original owner who had ordered the car directly from a dealership in 1996.  The car had 131,000 miles on the odometer when I bought it and I have since added more than 10,000 miles to that figure.


<b>Exterior:</b>
=======
The exterior styling of the Maxima is a controversial issue for some people.  I personally like the styling, with the exception of the tail-lights.  Many people prefer the sharper, squarer design of the '94 and older Maximas to the more rounded look.  However, I continually receive compliments about my car and can only assume that its styling is appealing to most people.

My Maxima SE has fog lights, aluminum wheels, and the gold package (minus pinstripes).  The radio antenna retracts in the left rear bumper, giving the car a much cleaner look.

The only major change that I would make besides the tail-lights, would be to install a bigger tire/wheel size (from a 15 to an 18) and lower the car an inch or two.

<b>Interior:</b>
=======
The interior of the Maxima is very thoughtfully put together.  On my SE model, I have a black leather interior with a 8-way power adjustable driver's seat.  The seats are in great condition for a 140,000 mile car.  The driver's seat is the only one that shows any wear on the leather.  Everyone who rides in my car raves about the interior.  The black interior really adds a special touch of class and culture.  One small downside to the leather seats is slight discomfort in extreme temperatures.  Also, when cornering hard, there is a tendency to slide laterally.  Even with these minor downsides, I would still go with leather in a heartbeat.

My car also came with the factory installed Bose sound system.  The CD player cranks out powerful, clean sound with almost no distortion.  There are two large speakers in the rear window which have enough power visibly rattle the windows.

In regard to other options, my Maxima came with all of the luxury amenities that you would expect from a '96 car.  Power mirrors, cruise control on the steering wheel, sunroof, and ski pass-through are all included.

Overall, the interior is a very comfortable and enjoyable place to spend any length of time.

<b>Engine:</b>
======
Possibly the best aspect of the Maxima is its engine/drivetrain.  This speaks mountains about the engine as the rest of the car is very well designed.  The engine in all models of Maximas (GXE, SE, and GLE) is the same.  Nissan placed a 3.0 liter, V6 engine under the of all '95-'99 Maximas.  This engine is a part of the VQ family of engines currently used by Nissan in many of their vehicles such as the 350Z, Altima, Murano, Pathfinder, and Maxima.  This specific engine has won several awards including being placed on Ward's 10Best engines list for six consecutive years.

What makes this engine remarkable is its refined delivery of power throughout the rev-band.  This 3.0L V6 makes 190hp and 210lbs/ft of torque.  I have personally recorded a 0-60mph dash of 7.5sec with my 4-speed automatic Maxima.  Take into account that my car also has over 140,000 miles and snow tires.  Acceleration is available almost anywhere and is very satisfying.

In addition to great power, I also enjoy very good gas mileage.  I average around 20mpg in town and have reached 30mpg on the interstate.  One downside is that the Maxima sips premium fuel.  However, this is greatly outweighed by the benefits.

<b>Handling/Ride:</b>
============
Most likely the weakest department of the Maxima is its handling.  While the ABS brake system is effective and powerful, the suspension delivers a merely adequate ride.  There is considerable body role in the corners and large bumps are certainly felt by the passengers.  However, the Maxima is a very predictable car and really hangs on in the corners.  Once the tires finally break away, it is very easy to get the car back on line.  I have driven my Maxima in snow quite a lot and know that it is a great snow car.  I consistently give rides to my rear-wheel drive friends who can't get their cars out of their driveways.

<b>Reliability:</b>
=========
Even though most people think of Hondas, Toyotas, or Subarus as the most reliable vehicles, Nissan also has an excellent reputation for building reliable vehicles.  I have personally never experienced any mechanical difficulties with my Nissan Maxima.  Even with 143,000 miles worth of wear and tear, everything stills works and works well.
<b><i>Rating: 10/10</b></i>


<b>Value:</b>
======
I purchased my Maxima for several thousand below the blue book private party value.  Maximas are usually less expensive than comparable Hondas or Toyotas.  Based on the quality of the product and the reasonableness of the price, the Maxima has a very high value to dollar ratio.
