            The Chrysler Corporation has lost their shirts in years prior with the periodic launches of revolutionary design concepts. In the early 30�s, Chrysler�s corporate-wide Airflow program nearly bankrupted them. In the early 60�s, Dodge and Plymouth styling took a frightening turn for the worse. In the 70�s, Chrysler�s all new �Fuselage� styling theme made the products look overly bulky. Also, federalized bumpers ruined the concept a mere few seasons later. Still, though, until the 1970�s, nobody questioned the engineering. Also, some truly stunning automobiles have been created amongst the bull-plop over the years, like the 58� Plymouth Belvedere Sport Coupe and 56� Chrysler 300B. However, so overshadowed were these superlatives that America�s number three automaker has been naturally cautious otherwise. Not until the 1984 launch of the minivan, did Chrysler truly stand out with a well-executed and unique concept. Still, though, the styling of the Voyager/Caravan was not setting Pebble Beach on fire. It was not until the early 90�s with the introduction of the production version of the Viper, that the Chrysler first seated themselves as not just a styling leader, but an innovator. 

The 2001 Chrysler PT (Personal Transportation) Cruiser feels like a totally new creation, the likes of which the public has not seen since the minivan or pony car. It is difficult to categorize. It�s not a car, truck, wagon, or minivan. More over, it takes the best of all concerned and brings them together. The concept though is not entirely new. In the mid 80�s, Nissan�s Stanza/Axcess and Mitsubishi�s Colt Vista tried to fill this void with moderate success. The Nissan faded away and the crude Vista made way for the compact Expo, which was also sold through Plymouth, Dodge, and Eagle dealers. These little anti-minivans had 16 valve engines with manual/automatic transmissions. They were high quality and versatile, featuring ABS, all-wheel-drive, and seating for up to 7. They were dimensionally similar to the PT and offered similar (for the time) performance. So why did the concept ultimately fail? A bad time in the market is one reason, but the lack of a soul is perhaps the most important. In 1992 when these cars hit the streets, minivans had reached a new level of V6 powered sophistication and softened, early 90�s styling. In addition to this, the SUV market was still burgeoning, untapped gold. Plus, the product itself was lifeless and felt, as was once very common with Japanese cars, too utilitarian. There was no room for a little car like this that couldn�t stand out. 

Fast forward to the year 2000 where everything has changed. Certain previously successful markets have ether grown stale, or over saturated.  In a world where SUV�s are expensive, minivans are uncool, and passenger cars lack versatility, the PT Cruiser stands as a glorious achievement in nearly all aspects of model execution. The PT, Cruiser fills the void left by nearly every automotive market segment and makes no compromises in the process.  It seems to cross cultural lines too, even better than the Rolling Stones. I personally know PT owners from ever single marketable demographic from teenagers to the elderly. Soccer moms to middle aged men. Why? Well, how could any person not want a car that is stylish, sporty, economical, versatile, comfortable, and inexpensive all at he same time? With the PT, it�s very hard, but not impossible.

Chrysler�s Cruiser is clearly a reflection of another era. It�s not a restoration of previously popular design ideas, but more of an adaptive re-use. Themes are applied to the design, but take the shape determined by the PT�s concepts of practicality, usefulness, and cost effectiveness. Some look at the PT and see a 1934 Chrysler Custom Imperial Airflow (which was the first car to use Chrysler�s cab-forward engineering). Personally, I think that I see a little more inspiration drawn from the 1937 Ford Tudor Sedan. Regardless of what the stimuli may have been, some design byproducts of the 30�s apply themselves ideally today, especially when mounded atop of first rate technology. 

The PT was initially conceived as a Plymouth product. Frankly, it would have slid into the Plymouth line much easier and could have even saved the lackluster brand from the chopping block. However, in the auto industry, perception follows reality by about ten years, and by the PT�s inception, it was too late for poor Plymouth. I was fortunate enough to log several days of drive time behind the wheel of a new PT Cruiser, last September when my wife and I rented one for the weekend. To begin with, I love the commotion that the PT generates. I have driven Porsches and gotten fewer stares. People love this little car. Every where you go, people want to talk about it, touch it, and see all of it�s features. Our Patriot Blue PT was a moderately optioned, Limited model, featuring ABS, overhead console, chrome wheels, touring suspension with upgraded tires, fog lamps, a CD player, and an automatic transmission. It was missing the smoker�s package and leather upholstery. The retail price was listed at a little over $21,000 before taxes. Options aside, this price nets you privacy glass, power windows and door locks, power steering, tilt wheel, rear defrost with wiper, A/C, and a 2.4 liter, in line 4-cylinder engine.  This particular motor, mated to a 4-speed automatic, transmission, also sees duty in the base model Dodge Caravan. The 5-speed manual, which is standard, is a modified unit from the Dodge Stratus.  The engine is a dual overhead cam design, sporting 16 valves. It produces a respectable 150 horsepower and 162 pound feet of torque. With the Automatic, 0-60 is seen in 10.5 seconds. With the manual, the same deed can be can be accomplished in 8.5 seconds. These figures are not stellar, but are comparable to most SUV�s and sports wagons around this price. Frankly, I felt a little more kick in the upper rev ranges would be nice, but the PT zips in and out of traffic with verve and cruises on the freeways with confidence. Perhaps a power increase will come in subsequent years (I have heard plausible rumors of a 200 horsepower, turbo model). I was expecting a quality drive, but with typical Stratus/Neon characteristics. I couldn�t have been more incorrect, though. Noise, vibration, and harshness (low as they may be in the Stratus/Neon) were almost undetectable. This could be because the engine employs counter-rotating balance shafts to help cancel out second order vibrations that are common in larger 4-bangers. Even passing was smooth. Stopping capabilities were equally gratifying. While front disc/rear drum set-ups are standard, our PT was equipped with the optional ABS assisted front vented disc/rear disc set-up. Stopping from 70 then comes in a respectable 186 feet. Aggressive braking did produce just a hint of detectable brake fade, but the Cruiser rounded the corners like a champ and never felt wobbly under evasive maneuvers.

At highway speeds, one would anticipate that the PT�s 63-inch height would betray it�s handling characteristics and cross wind stability. Not the case at all. The PT feels much lower than it actually is. The front suspension componentry is a MacPhearson strut/coil spring scenario. The rear suspension, though is a less common affair for a car these days. The obvious choice, the strut-type independent rear from the Neon, was discarded in favor of a low tech, yet highly complex twist beam axle with coil springs and trailing arms. The reason for this is because the mandatory strut towers would have intruded on cargo space and complicated opening of the rear hatch. I like this logic, as I value functionality over technology any day, though this design does preclude the PT from ever having an all-wheel-drive configuration. However, handling is generally good. The PT is wide, with its wheels pushed to the corners, as is common with Chrysler�s cab forward design work.  Also, weight distribution is somewhat close to 50/50 (actually 58.2/41.8) and the upgraded, R rated Goodyear Eagles are very grippy. Low speed cornering is tight and high-speed lane changes very stable and confident. The PT is actually rather fun to toss about on back roads. Interior noise levels at cruising speeds is about 70 decibels, making it much quieter than a Neon, but noisier than a 300M. Dual front airbags are standard, with side airbags being optional. Also standard are childproof locks for rear doors, universal anchors for child seats, and a theft deterrent system with keyless entry.

The pre-war derived steep windscreen and tall sloping roofline lend an ideal opportunity for headroom and storage space, while keeping the overall length of the PT to a minimum. As an ancillary result, step in height is generous (allowing easy egress/ingress) and seating positions are terrific.  Also, the PT has the missing piece that would have previously prevented the retro proportions from working; front wheel drive. The front drive transaxle from the Chrysler mini-vans allows for a nearly flat floor. This in turn provides more comfortable rear seating, and a low rear load floor. The bumpers are absolutely stupendous. Being non-painted, monolithic plastic protects from the appearance of scuffs and is cheap to manufacture. They are integrated well but are still independent for a little reflex action during low speed collisions. They also cross the grill in a fashion that remains supportive of the styling concept. How they managed to take this simple and sometimes poorly executed element on the car, and instill practicality, cost effectiveness, performance, and style all in one swoop is a phenomenon. The modern, monochrome look is even pulled off successfully with a sprinkling of classy chrome trim. Chrome door handles look great, feel great, and actuate door release with the solid push of a button. Also, the bulging fenders are joined by flared sills that intimate the idea of running boards, but more importantly, helps to reduce the vertical mass of the PT.  So well, does this work that the PT�s size is somewhat deceptive in photographs.  Where the New Beetle is substantially larger than it seems in magazines, the PT is actually the opposite. It�s dimensions, both exterior and interior, are tight. But the PT never feels uncomfortable, has plenty of usable storage, and is ideally sized for traffic/parking issues. 

The raking, egg-crate grill is successfully dramatic. Composite headlamps offer equal levels of style with a sleek, modern, appearance. The tail lamps are terrific. They are shaped in a modern, teardrop form, but when the brake pedal is applied, a small, circular star burst form illuminates simulating, successfully I might add, that of late 30�s cars. Base plastic wheelcovers are certainly attractive, but the real money is in the gorgeous chromed, 16-inch aluminum wheels. Chrysler�s winged logo is well placed on the nose, and cleverly integrated into the rear hatch release. I even like the �PT� font used on the vehicles name. If feels like a sleek art-deco era script only with slanted motion, intimating speed and fun. Inside, the PT is equally stylish. The door panels seem old fashioned, but feel modern and comfortable. Ergonomics are fine as all controls are in easy sight and reach.  Quality abounds as well through high-end textures and assembly practices. Gauges are easy to read and controls turn with a confident click.  I like the body colored panels on the dash. Also, three separate power points are offered for your laptops, cell phones, or whatever, and four total cupholders. Five-speed models get a great, retro shift lever featuring a chrome shaft mounted with a white, plastic ball shift knob � awesome! The seats are comfortable and room for your body is excellent. We had five people in the PT plus some cargo and nobody complained (though we could have been sitting on piles of barbed wire, for all we cared, we were just so thrilled to be in the PT). Rear cargo space is limited to only 19 cubic feet. However, folding the seats forward changes that to over 64 cubic feet. In addition to folding flat, the seats can also be split or removed entirely. The front passenger seat can fold as well, allowing an 8-foot ladder to be inserted. A rear shelf is also present and adjustable in five different positions.

The PT, like any automobile, is not without it�s problems. It�s not very powerful. The 2.4 liter four banger is ideally suited for cruising around town with just you and a few friends. Load the PT down with five adults and luggage, and the steep hills become a burden. While I like the center mounted power window switches for front seat passengers, they are terribly inconvenient for back seat passengers who have to lean over to lower their windows. Also, there is no front control for the rear windows. On sunny days, the driver has to reach behind the seat and feel around for the controls if they want the windows lowered or raised. The rub strips on the sides, while providing a nice detail on the body are too low to be of any functional use. Finally, the design work raises some stylistic red flags with me. The auto industry has never been able to thrive on the notion that the best product wins � take the Airflow initiative, for example. A lot of the success of products, these days, lies in the marketing. A product is nothing if it�s virtues cannot be conveyed to the public in a manner supporting it�s concept and creating the right image. That said, it sometimes doesn�t pay to go out on a limb in one way or another, with a mass-produced, bread and butter product like the PT.  For a volume-selling car to be successful, it has to be attractive to the buyer, but also non-offensive. If the car is too controversial in some manner, it then becomes a specialty car, image vehicle, or niche product. And the profits in these segments are often intangible. The PT�s styling is a billboard of uniqueness. As is often true with the entertainment industry, though, the brighter you burn the quicker you burn out. When the PT first hit the streets, car accidents resulted from other drivers breaking their necks to catch a glimpse of it. As the roads have become moderately saturated with them, the novelty has worn off. That said; will the public grow tired of something that novel? Chrysler is betting no, and with good reason. After all the hullabaloo is gone, the PT has the functionality and quality to continue as a force in the market. While I genuinely believe this to be true, I also believe that the novelty is what comprises a great deal of the PT�s visual value. People that buy this car should be prepared to look at it in the garage every morning before they go to work for however many years they intend to keep it. In the market place, currently, there are a lot of other small SUV�s and sports wagons that can fill the PT�s bill with less accurately datable design work. Will the PT�s styling be able to sustain itself when compared to the classy, simple styling of an Audi A4 Avant, or Ford Escape? 

It�s too soon to tell. It is my gut feeling, though, that the PT�s styling will not age well. Still, though, the little Chrysler, whatever it is classified as, is a solid, useful, and reliable machine. That said,the PT Cruiser's value must be, as Boston put it, "more than a feel'in". The sheer happy vibe that the little PT gives you needs to be alot more than it's cutie-pie throwback to the deco ladened, pre-internet periods of yore. It simply has to be, because the PT is carving into the post-depression era for all it's worth. So well packaged is it, though, that I am giving it my seal of approval, despite my concerns of the appearance growing rapidly stale. Nobody will ever realistically look back on the PT as beautiful, because it�s physical beauty is not it�s own, but that of another era. The excellence is in the clever way that the vehicle was executed, or, simply put, in the way that someone else�s beauty was applied to good engineering. It�s tall but doesn�t look gangly, it�s spacious but doesn�t feel big, it�s inexpensive but doesn�t feel cheap. I have to applaud Chrysler for this one. If you want to buy a versatile car, you could certainly do a lot worse. However, buy it only if it meets your practical needs as a car, not because of the statement that it makes. Statements often change in time, and there are no guarantees on what they may say in the future.
