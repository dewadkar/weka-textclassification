            I bought my B2300 brand-new in 1997, and have had it for 4 years and 44,000 miles now. For options, it has the carpeted/cloth interior, sliding rear window, bedliner, alloy wheels, and tachometer. In four years, the only major problem was that the air-conditioning compressor died and had to be replaced (under warranty). Regular oil changes (and some other maintenance every 30k miles) is enough to keep it running well for years. For a truck, the ride is very smooth and the handling is decent. Acceleration with the 2.3-litre four-cylinder engine (since improved) and the 5-speed manual is mediocre at best; don't try to merge onto the freeway with the air-conditioning running. On the plus side, my fuel economy averages 25 mpg in mixed driving.
Also, these trucks are built very sturdily and can survive an accident fairly well. Finally, for a $10k vehicle, the factory speakers sound quite nice. The only regrets I have about this model are:

1) I wish I had chosen the V6-powered version; 112 hp is not enough to move its rather prodigious bulk in anything resembling a short amount of time.

2) I wish I had chosen the extended cab.

Other than that, I have no complaints about this vehicle, and would recommend it to a friend interested in a compact pickup.
