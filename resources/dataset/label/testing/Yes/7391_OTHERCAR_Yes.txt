            Before I even get started with the details, let me say that I'm really happy subaru finally brought this car to north america!!!! I hope they eventually make the STI version available with more horsepower, a 6-speed, and a better steering box. Until then, this is a breakthrough car for Subaru on this continent!

Going rallying? Blasting around country roads? Street-light racing around the city? The WRX is a super car. The 2.0 liter turbo engine is great. The awd handling is great. And, it's pretty practical as a daily driver. The car is so good, that it usually gets compared to cars costing far more (Audi S4, BMW 3 series). In a few categories it even compares favorably to those cars. This car has been around Europe and Asia for years and is justifiably popular in those markets. Now it is available here in the states at a great price. Note that Subaru is even selling it here for less than they do in Europe and Asia - so it's a great deal as well. 

So, why didn't I buy it? after a couple of test drives and a lot of research, I decided it wasn't for me. I do a fair amount of highway driving; and this car, frankly, is a lousy highway cruiser. Its steering (pretty precise for back roads) is nervous and darty on long hauls. Its engine is powerful and torquey; but at highway speeds of 75-80 mph, it runs at very high revs (this car needs a 6-speed manual instead of a 5-speed) and there is little sound-deadening material to keep that buzzing out of your ears. 

The exterior styling is not to my tastes at all. I think the outgoing model (before the re-style) was MUCH better looking. The interior styling is a bizarre mixed bag of good and bad (momo steering wheel and aluminum pedals - cool! ---  the rest of the fabrics and plastics - yuck!). 

The engine is great if you really know how to work it. The power and torque are great. But there is also some real turbo lag down low in the rev range. You can get around that with the aggressive use of the pedals and the shifter; but it takes constant attention. The shifter is good, the clutch is nice. A short-throw shifter is available as an option. I'd definitely get that!! The steering is nice, but it's a bit light for my tastes. Supposedly there's a better steering box available in Europe and Asia as part of high-spec version tuned by Subaru's sports division (STI). We might get that in a year or two.

And, finally, the price tag. Everyone talks about how great this car is at $25K. Well, guess what. With all the options I wanted, the price comes up to $32K. Suddenly, this car ain't so much of a bargain.

It all boils down to what you're looking for in a car. Going auto-crossing? this car would be a hoot! Commuting to work 20-plus miles each way on the highway every day at high speeds? it'd get old pretty quickly.  It's a personal decision. I get my chances at back-road blasts a lot, and this car would be great for those; but it's just not a 'complete' enough car for me. It's too one-dimensional. I guess I'll just have to find a way to justify the extra $9k for an S4.
