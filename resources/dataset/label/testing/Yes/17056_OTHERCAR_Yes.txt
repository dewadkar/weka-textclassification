            From a timing perspective, a situation presented itself where we could purchase a new Land Cruiser (LC) now. Something that would have been out of reach for us in the future. 

We traded in our '98 LC (see my other review) and decided to purchase a new one. All of what I mentioned in that review applies here. Our old LC served us faithfully and basically spoiled us to the point that no other SUV can compare, but let's face it, these things are expensive and are they really worth it?

In short YES. 

Especially if you're an individual who tends to hold on to your vehicle for a long time. Now a LOADED LC lists for close to $63K. Note, I said they list for $63K, but we bought ours for significantly less that that. You can opt for one with less options, but good luck finding one. It seems as though Toyota only ships them to the U.S. one way, LOADED. If you want a decontented version, you may have to special order it. 

Ours came with the DVD Navigation, 18 inch wheels, side airbags, roll-over side curtain airbags, running boards, roof rack, and also the rear seat DVD entertainment package.

Other standard features include:
4 wheel traction control
vehicle stability control
Center locking differential
Fully automatic climate control
Dual front power seats
Power windows with express up/down on all four windows
Power moon roof with one touch open/close
Homelink univeral garage door opener
Third row seats
Leather seats including the third row.
Power locks that can be programed to automatically lock/unlock in any of four ways
Auto on/off headlights
Power tilt/telescopic steering wheel
6-disc CD/DVD changer in the console
Auto dimming rear view mirror
Rear camera
Rear seat audio

You get the picture..... it's loaded.

Land Cruisers are legendary for being able to rack up high miles with only routine maintenance. You can easily put 200K miles on one. So with that said, if you're the type to hold onto your cars for a long time, a LC would typically last as long as possibly two lesser vehicles. How's that for justifying the purchase, not that it really needs it.

The current generation LC was introduced in 1998 which included the V8. In 2003 Toyota made some minor exterior cosmetic changes which included an updated grille and tail lamps. The interior received a new dashboard with chrome and brushed metal trim pieces. Horsepower was bumped up from 230 to 235 and a five speed transmission was added. Gas mileage remains dismal, but highway mileage bumped up from 15 to 17mpg, due to the extra gear in the transmission. The LC requires premium gasoline

This thing rivals most luxury sedans when it comes to interior richness, material, fit, finish and content. Keep in mind that this is still a 2.5 ton SUV, so it isn't going to handle like a sports car, but as SUVs go, you'll be hard pressed to find many that will be as composed and quiet as this one. It isolates you from outside noises and travelling along at 70mph, you barely hear any outside noises.

Controls are intuitive and work flawlessly. I found the Navigation system to not be as intuitive as units you'll find in say Hondas/Acuras. To explain further, when I purchased my '01 Acura TL, I was immediately able to start using the navigation system without having to read the manual. The one in the LC was not as simple and I found myself having to refer to the manual quite often. To it's defense, the LC navigation has many more features, and can be configured in many more ways that the Honda/Acura model (pre-'04). The navigation system will also play DVDs on the dashboard screen as long as the vehicle is in PARK, once you take it out of gear, you get audio only. When putting it in reverse, the screen switches to the rear view camera. This camera isn't intended to take the place of turning your head, but it is useful to spot an object, such as a bike that was left behind the vehicle.

The navigation system has the ability to recognize voice commnds. There are about a 100 or so commands that you can give it ranging from raising the volume on the stereo to entering destinations. I must say that I'm not impressed with this feature and it's apparant that there are still bugs that need to be worked out. It often misunderstands my commands entirely or not at all. I seem to have a little better luck than my wife who can't seem to get it to listen to her at all. I guess I'm not the only one who's accused of not listening to her. ;-) 

The rear seat entertainment (RSE) system comes with wireless headphones that allow the kiddies to watch their own shows while mom and dad can listen to something else. The rear seat audio system allows rear seat passengers to listen from a different source than the front seat occupants.

The RSE is a completely seperate unit than the 6-disc CD/DVD changer. As a result, the slot to load the DVDs is installed in the side panel between the second and third rows. Not very accessible, especially if you have the third row seats folded up against the sides.

Land Cruisers are designed to handle much more than most will subject it to, hence the long lifespan of most of these vehicles. That is what your paying for!

Can you find a reliable vehicle for less? sure you can, but I challenge you to take a test drive and then find another vehicle, even one that is comparable in price, that can hold a candle to the LC.

So that's how we justified this vehicle to ourselves. We plan on keeping it for at least ten years. Normally during that time, we might go through two cars. Not the case with the Land Cruiser.

If you got a little more cash, you can always upgrade to the Lexus LX470, which is basically a dressed up Land Cruiser. The LX470 adds electronically adjustable suspension, memory mirrors/seats, wood trim and a few other features. Night Vision is also available on the LX470.

Drive one and you'll understand.
