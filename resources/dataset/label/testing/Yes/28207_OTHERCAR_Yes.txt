            I've read many of the "non-recomendations" and I'm puzzled!

I bought (leased) mine in July of 1999 and to this day have not had a single problem. The ride is stable and quiet. The fuel economy with any V8 is going to be high, so that's my only "con" but I knew about it before I drove it off the lot. So I can't really complain; it's the price we pay for power, right?  I get between 13 and 18 MPG, depending on where and how I drive (city vs. highway - aggressive or more laid-back).

It has a lot of power. (I had it up to 110 MPH once - though not for long - and it still felt stable and responsive.) And it tows a boat up a mountain without breaking a sweat, even with the A/C on. Cornering in city driving is predictable and precise Overall its handling instills confidence. I do wish I had 4-wheel ABS. In hard braking situations, the rear-wheel only ABS (standard) is helpful in keeping the rear end from washing out, but if you lock up the front, say in a hard-braking turn or swerve, you're gonna keep going straight. Four-wheel ABS would allow all the wheels to continue turning, providing needed control when evading a road hazard or an insane driver.

The interior is nicely appointed if a bit utilitarian when it comes to cosmetics, at least on my model. I didn't get leather or the woodgrain trim or the chrome door latches. The interior is more spacious than anything smaller than a Yukon or Expedition. The Explorer and 4-Runner are small compared to the Durango, cargo-capacity-wise. Even so, my Durango can fit in parking spaces on the street that most people would only attempt in a small car. This is because the Durango's turning radius is super tight, something I only truly appreciated after driving someone's compact car that had a bigger radius than my SUV! "What? Your car can't make a U-turn here? Jeez. I do it every day in my Durango!"

I like the styling better than any other SUV except maybe the BMW X5, but that's almost twice the price, for more luxury and maybe less "abusability." I'd never want to take the X5 off the pavement! I must say the Durango handles urban hazards such as dips, curbs and potholes with enthusiasm.

One undocumented safety feature it has is the absence of Firestone tires that come standard on most Ford trucks. And I've never felt any rollover tendency while cornering or making sudden lane-change at speed. (Although, any SUV will roll in certain situations.)

So, I don't understand many of the complaints other people are voicing. I change the filter and oil (with Mobil 1) every 5000 miles. And I follow the maintenance schedule as well. That's all one really needs to do to keep a good car going strong these days. I heartily recommend the Durango.
