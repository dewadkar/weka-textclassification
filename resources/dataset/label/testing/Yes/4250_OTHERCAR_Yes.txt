            i bought a bmw 318i...one thing bmw has always been a trusted brand in the family...the reason why my father is alive today is because of a bmw...his car(BMW 520 92') flipped a couple of times and my dad wasnt even scratched..he just walked (well crawled) out of the car....so there's safety for ya...although the car was totalled..

a 318 is a good buy if you have monetary constraints.......if u dont chuck in a couple of dollar for a 323 or even better a 328...

LOve..
this car responds extremely well...excellent handling...i have done sharp corners at over 70 km/h and the car felt good!!...and this doesnt even have the All season traction control....

next thing is power...the car spring to life at about 120km/h to 140km/h....excellent for highway driving.....and i must say that power is there when you need it.....especially if u are in the &quot;sports&quot; mode...

the seats are comfortable(leather) although if u park yer car in the sun beware!!...the leather is extremely hot....ouch..

mileage is reasonable...its not the best but for the excellent ride is well worth the extra bucks....

the sound system is good too....the car had a standard kenwood stereo system...above average sound and quality..

its a real quiet ride.....90% of noise is filtered out and the cabin is extremely good...with no engine vibrations filtering through...

it has the anti-dazzle rear view mirror...which means that when driving at night when a car is behind you the rear view mirror darkens to reduce glare...a minor boon but trust me it does come it handy...

Hate..

sigh...the acceleration leaves much do me desired.....0-100 km/h is slow...almost sluggish...but is forgiven as its power comes back between 120-150 km/h.....i once raced with a Honda civic SiR (1.6 DOHC VTEC).....yeah sure pick-up wise it thrashed me flat...but once we hit 140 km/h....it was bye bye civic...i hit a 190km/h....by then i was miles ahead of the civic..so i guess it evens out...

the back seating can be a bit cramped for 3....although for two it would be spacious although if u were over 6 feet then there might be a slight problem getting in....

overall a 318 offer a above average ride in smoothness and in comfort.......it has a smoothness only a V6 could have...and mind you itz a in-line 4 cyclinder car 8valve SOHC but there is a 16valve one available but it was found that the torque developed in the 8valve model was better....

all in all i havent encountered any problems with the car....except the increasing number of speeding tickets...trust me its an effort to say below 120km/h.....the car yearns for more...

318 is a good car for getting around and for people around the age of 18-23....after that u need a 328 or a 5 series..

Note: Try not to use Pirelli P6000 tires, yes i know they are good tyres...i use them but by some strange yet unknown reason they make a funny whurring noise which is apparent in the range of 60-80km/h. Check this with the dealer.

Also check the suspension of the car and the overall balance of the car. Make sure the car is not tilting to one side.
