            I purchased this product at K-Mart for $149 (after a $50 rebate.)    

The camera is easy to use and set up on the computer.  If you have some experience with computers and even no experience with photography it should be easy to take clear and colorful pictures (provided you use the flash, which increases the cameras shutter speed).

The camera was good for itï¿½s price, size, and picture quality.  It takes anywhere from six to twenty pictures (depending on the quality setting).  Other features include a tripod mount, an LCD screen, and a self timer mode, and a 2X digital zoom feature.  It uses four AA batteries or an AC adapter (sold separately) for energy.

The only accessories you may need are a larger memory card, rechargeable batteries ($10), and a tripod ($20.)  However, if you are a first timer and are just looking to have fun you'll only need the batteries.
