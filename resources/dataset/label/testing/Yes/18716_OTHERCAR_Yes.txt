            My parents bought a Buick Park Avenue new in 1995.  They had it until about 6 months ago when they traded it in on a Dodge Durango (different review...you should check it out).

Anyway, my mother loved this car.  Here is basically what she loved about it:

1.  It was BIG!  I always told her I felt like I needed to honk when I went through an intersection like a train because this car was so big.  You could easily fit 6 people comfortably in this car.
2.  It drove very smoothly.  Even I had to admit that.  I drove it a few times on long trips with my dad and this car drove very smoothly.  The car didn't bounce around, even on Arkansas interstates.
3.  It was fully loaded.  The Buick Park Avenue comes almost fully loaded straight from the factory other than options like CD player (in 1995 it didn't come with this), heated seats, etc.
4.  She never had any problems with it.  My parents are very good about keeping their vehicles in good shape.  They changed the oil every 3000 miles.  They never had any major problems with this car.  The only problems they had were a dead battery and a flat tire.
5.  It was very safe.  The Park Avenue is a very safe car according to Consumer Reports.  This was a big plus for my parents when they bought this car.  

Now, here is what I didn't like about the car.  This wasn't my car, so it didn't matter...I just thought I would throw it in my review in case these things bother you:

1.  It was too big.  This car is next to impossible to park in a regular parking space.  You need to park in the back of the lot so you have plenty of room to back out when you are ready to leave.
2.  It didn't handle very well.  Of course, this isn't a sports car, but I had to drive extra careful in this car because it wasn't made to take turns very well.
3.  The acceleration isn't the best.  Again, this car weight quite a bit, and with a 6 cylinder, the get-up-and-go wasn't what I would have wanted it to be for a car of mine.

As you can see, the Buick Park Avenue is a very nice car.  The things i didn't like about it were basically pet peeves of mine.  

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a big car that is very safe and smooth when driving.  This would be a great car for a family of 5 that doesn't want to drive an SUV.  It has plenty of leg room in the front and back.  It also has a very large truck.

I would not recommend this car to someone who is wanting a car with very good acceleration or good handling. <br><br>
