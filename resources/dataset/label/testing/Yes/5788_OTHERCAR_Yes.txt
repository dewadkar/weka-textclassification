            The D-490 is my third Olympus digicam.  I upgraded after being very happy with my Oly 450-Z and 460.  In between, I owned or played with several other brands, and while I found a friend's Sony Mavica and my Dad's high-end Kodak to be very nice cameras, I feel very strongly that my Oly's beat them all.

I had no affinity for the Olympus brand before owning my first one, and it was purchased only because of other ePinions (at the time) and a great sale, but the camera quickly grew on me and I found myself grabbing it more often than my other cameras.

I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking that Olympus is perfect, because digicams (of all brands) are inherently susceptible to the problems that arise with any computer-chip based product.  My first Olympus 460 had multiple problems out of the box, but every one of my emails to Olympus Tech Support was answered within 24 hours.  I ended up turning that "lemon" in, but was rewarded with a brand new trouble-free camera in three days!

I am now a month into using the D-490 and am very impressed at how far Olympus has come making the menu screens easier to use than the old 450-Z days.

Here's my recommendations for accessories and software:

1.  Throw away the serial cable for downloading.  Too slow; you'll become frustrated, and either drain your cam batteries or juggle too many cables.  Invest in either the new Olympus USB reader/writer or buy a FlashPath floppy drive adapter from ScanDisk.

2.  Buy rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  DigiCams eat batteries for dinner.  I could take over 170 photos with my 450-Z on a set of batteries, that went down with the 460, and I'm still evaluating the 490.

3.  Use the provided Olympus Camedia software as "proofing" software, but not for editing.  This program quickly opens up all the pics on your Smart card for preview, and also lets you quickly delete the ones that you know you don't want.  Simply save the good ones to another drive, and use a better editing program to polish those.

Hope this helps a little in your decision, and happy snapping!
