            Well people, this is the car you want if performance, fun to drive, cool features, and great value for your money is what you want.  I have owned two grand prix's a 1997 and a 1999 and basically they are the same car.  If you think that the grand prix is the car for you, don't make the mistake and don't forget to get the GTP option.  You get a great engine with 240 horsepower and 280 pounds of foot torque to propel this wide track rocket ship down the road.  I bought the car for my wife so I know that she really does'nt put the car throught its paces the way it should be, but a couple of times a week a take the car for a few high speed runs in excess of 100mph.  The car is pretty stable, but you can feel the speed, after all the car is built in the USA.  As far as zero to sixty it kicks ass.  I usually drive a long side my buddy with a bmw 540i with 282 horsepower and a price tag of 60k, and the GTP holds its own and then some.  As far as the inside it has all of the bells and whistles{i always get every option so that you don't regret it later} that a car of this type should.  The heads up display of vital stats is really cool, and the feel of wheel is solid.  My only grip is that the speedo only goes to 115, but the digital heads up speedo goes to 124 and counting.  For 26k loaded this car is a great deal, and i should know because the other great deal is the nissan maxima se, and i have that car too.<br><br>
