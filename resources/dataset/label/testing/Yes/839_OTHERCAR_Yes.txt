            Ok, I've been using this camera for a bit now.  And I am very pleased with it.  I've ordered this camera before I even do any research on the item.  It seem to me at the time, that this is a decent camera for its price.  I was just a little disappointed that it does not come with the case nor the AC adaptor, but I can deal with that.

After I've place my order, I went to websites and read reviews about this camera.  One major thing (according to everyone else) that had me worried was the battery comsumption.  I was ready to buy rechargeable batteries and the charger.  Good thing I hadn't done so, because its been over a month now and the battery indicator is still full and I've taken a whole lot of pictures and transfer pictures to the PC many times.  Also the charger and the batteries would have cost me ever 50 bucks.  Though, I am not sure how many pictures I have taken.  At Cnet User Product Review section, all of them said that the battery only last for about 100 exposures and isn't enough battery lift time for them.  Now, first of all, who takes 100+ pictures at one period of time--do they <i>love</i> taking pictures that much?  If you are going on a vacation and need to take huge amount of pictures, I would understand.  And to me, spending couple of bucks having some spare batteries would not dry up my wallet.  But then again buying the battery-charger and the batteries would have been a good investment--can be used with other gadgets too.

I have not seen a bad review for this camera, EXCEPT the ones that Cnet published (the editor).  They rated this camera like a tin can.  They said the picture quality is POOR.  I strongly disagree on that.  I think it takes better pictures than many cameras that are more expensive.  This camera was developed with Pentex, one of the leading brand in imaging. ::Side Note:: Pentex has put the same EXACT camera on the market with different name.
