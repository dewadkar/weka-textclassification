            I bought my 1994 Concorde new in the summer of 1994 and it has been a great car.  It has lots of room and the seats are comfortable.  The ride is excellent and it still looks good.  I have only had one problem and that was an electronic part that went out that was less than $200 to fix.  Other than that, the car has held up great.  I have not had any problems with the transmission or the A/C.  I have almost 90,000 miles on it and its been great.  I did have to have the hood replaced due to a rust spot and that was taken care of by the dealer under warranty.  I have had the car in for service at all the major intervals (every 15M miles) along with normal oil changes at roughly 5M mile intervals and I have replaced the front and rear brakes and put new on 4 new tires.  I fully intent to keep this car until my 12 year old daughter turns 16 and wants a car.  Im confindent it will provide her with good basic transportation at that point.  I recently bought a 2001 Town and Country so I trust the Chrysler brand.

I have not had the problems other people have had with the car.  Hopefully, their situations are not the norm and mine is.  If you are interested in buying a 94 Concorde, I would, as with any used car, have a mechanic check it out.  I would recommend this car to anyone.
