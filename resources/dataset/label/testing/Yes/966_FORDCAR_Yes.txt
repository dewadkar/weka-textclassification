            Ever had the need for space? Ever dream of driving in style in a full size vehicle? Now you can, all the space and style you need in a pick up truck. The F150 is a excellent truck for towing, moving, working, camping, and you can even fit the whole family in it. The suspension is the best on any vehicle and the control is very smooth, although the turning ratio can be better. If you like changing the look of your vehicle this is the truck to get. From custom wheels to body kits. For those who love speed you can even upgrade the engine to match the F150 lighting. When ford changed the look of the F150 I knew it would be mine, don't let the others change your mind, this is the truck if you like style. When it comes to power theres nothing like a V8 engine to do any job. Excellent truck and brilliant design.<br><br>
