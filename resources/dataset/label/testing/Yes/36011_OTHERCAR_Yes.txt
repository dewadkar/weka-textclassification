            This was the first Ford car I have ever owned. When I started having a problem with stuttering on acceleration, it was still under the original factory warranty. I took it into a local Ford/Lincoln dealership, which had many well-experienced mechanics. They could not seem to find a problem in the car. This happened another 4 times, same diagnosis. When I would get the car back, it continued the stuttering on acceleration. I received a call from Ford. This woman asked me if I was &quot;satisfied with my Lincoln ownership experience&quot;. I told her that I was happy with the car but explained about the problem as stated above. She then offered me some options: 1)$1,000 voucher to repair anything at any Ford dealer 2) Extend the warranty on any new Ford car purchase for an additional 2 years or 24,000 miles 3) 4,000 toward the purchase (after trade) of any Ford Car 4) Extended warranty for 2 years or 24000 mile on the existing vehicle. This was an amazing offer, since I didn't have enough time into the loan on the vehicle. I took the extended warranty on my Mark VIII. The approximate value of this is 1,500 dollars. This changed my whole feeling toward Ford, and they also finally figured out the initial problem (Number 1 plug wire short). This whole incident shows me that they care about their customers.<br><br>
