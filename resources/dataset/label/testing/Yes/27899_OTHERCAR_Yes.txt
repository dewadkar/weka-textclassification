<TEXT>
            I bought a 1994 Olds Cutlass Ciera SL with 78,000 km on it. The car now has 116,000 km on it. It has been reliable and virtually trouble free. I did not like the factory ride so I up graded the suspension to the heavy duty suspension. Although it is a little harsher on bumps etc it is a much better handling car.
Pros, good gas mileage for the size of car ( 34 mpg highway)
      comfortable ride for the size of car
      good family size car
      well equipped, power seats, windows, door locks, 
      air conditioning, tilt etc.       
      really good size trunk.
Cons  poor in cross winds due to old styling,
      wind noise around the doors,,,old styling again.
      I would prefer bucket seats rather than the 60/40 split front seat.
      Factory suspension too soft and sloppy
Overall It is a comfortable, quiet car,and I would buy another one.<br><br>
