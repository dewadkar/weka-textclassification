            This is my second digital camera. I did have an Olympus 360, but a day at the beach with an unexpected high tide was all it took to fry it. Word to the wise - if you take your camera to the beach be sure to leave your stuff far enough away from the water in case of the tide coming up. 

Anyway, I bought the 340 because it had all of the features that I used on the 360 without the higher price. In fact, I bought it as a factory refurbished unit on Ebay. Factory refurbished isnt' what you think. Anytime a package is opened and the unit is returned the law requires the manufacturer to called it refurbished even if all they did was repackage it. I got the camera, an 8mb SmartMedia card, an extra 16mb SmartMedia card, rechargeable batteries with charger, Olympus Camedia software and Adobe Photo Deluxe for only $210 dollars.

It is perfect for an entry level digital camera. I have taken hundreds of pics on it ranging from outdoor closeups of flowers to indoor photos during the holidays. The flash has always worked when needed and provided excellent illumination. If you use it at night, be sure to allow enough distance between the camera and the subject to allow for the flash. I have had a few pics come out with my subject awash in a bath of white light. 

I have a 16mb card and can put about 244 good pics on it at regular quality, 73 pics at high quality (HQ) and 36 pics at super high quality (SHQ). I generally take ordinary pics at the HQ setting. For pics I really want to come out good for digital manipulation or for enlarging I will switch to SHQ. The regular quality setting is good for quick pics you might want to email someone or post on the web. They don't do that well when enlarging.

My only complaint is the time it takes me to download pics to my PC. However, I am using the standard issue PC cable. There are several options you can choose from that will speed up the download process. I have just been reluctant to buy the extras as I will probably move on to a higher quality camera real soon.

This is a great little camera. I have taken hundreds of pics, emailed them to family and friends, saved them to CD, and printed them at home. I really enjoy it and I am real pleased with my final choice. I tend to overanalyze anything I plan to purchase and sometimes even talk myself out of buying at all. So take my word for it - get one and you will be happy.

Now if only I could decide what my next camera will be.....
