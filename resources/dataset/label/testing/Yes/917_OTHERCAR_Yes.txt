            Since I was preparing to go on a cruise, I need to find a camera that would be small enough to fit in a shirt or pant pocket.  Anything larger and I knew I wouldn't use it (as is the case with my old Minolta SLR).  After doing some research I finally narrowed my search down to the Dimage X and the Canon S220.  Utimately, my choice came down to the coolness factor.  This is where the X wins hands down.

Below are some of the highlights of the X.
Styling - This camera looks cool.  Everyone I ran into was amazed at how small the camera was.  The camera fit comfortably in my slacks and shorts.

Picture quality - Picture quality with the X is just as good as the Canon.  However, the pictures tend to be a bit soft.  The color saturation is great.  Greens and reds are great!

Memory - The X uses Secure Digital (SD) or the Multi-media Card (MMC).  The camera comes with one 8 meg SD card.  If you are on a long vacation, I strongly encourage you to purchase a 64 meg or larger card.  At the "fine" setting, you can only take about 8 pictures.  I would also purchase SD cards rather than MMC.  The write time on the SD card is much faster.

Battery - Purchase a second battery as one battery will not be enough.  One battery will last about 50 pics or so, however you will get considerably longer life if you turn off the LCD screen.  The battery charges in about 80 minutes.  Pretty good in my opinion.  I don't know if all cameras do this, but as the battery was getting lower and lower, the time from which I pressed the button to snap the picture to the actual image snap grew larger and larger.

Construction - The case itself seems to be quite well built, however the sound it makes when the lens is moving sounds like it's about to break (I believe others have complained about the same thing).  The battery/card cover is not made of metal as is the rest of the body.  I think this is on place where Minolta cheaped out on.

Operation - The learning curve for this camera is pretty quick.  The only major headache I have found is the number of button presses it takes to delete a picture.  

Features - Not too many.  There is a burst mode which allows the user to take a series of pictures in rapid succession.  Like most digital cameras, you can view the picture on the LCD screen.  There are no effects you can add to your photos on the camera side.  Any effects to your pictures will have to be done on the computer side.

Some final thoughts....
Despite lacking features that other camera if this price range will have, it's the size that convinced me to buy.  I find myself taking pictures wherever I go.  Something I didn't mention above is the power up time is extremely fast, about 2 seconds and you're shooting.  I'm just starting to print up my pictures from my vacation, and so far, I've been very satisfied.  If you don't crop your pictures, you can probably get an 8 x 10.  

One final thing...  You will have to change the way you hold a camera.  The first few pictures I took have my left index finger appearing.  A few shots and you'll be a pro!!!
