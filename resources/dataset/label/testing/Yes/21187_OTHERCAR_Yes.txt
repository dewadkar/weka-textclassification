                 This summer, I purchased a Geo Metro hatchback.  I had to buy a car in a hurry (since mine quit and I needed transportation to and from work) and I happened upon my Geo by chance.  It was in great condition and priced to move, so I bought it.  It was a stick, and I had only driven a stick a few times, but I still decided to go for it.
     Little did I know that I would fall in love with the car.  I handled beautifully, and it's small size made getting around the city of Louisville, where I was living at the time, much easier.  I could park it anywhere, and it could turn in a corner.  *Smile*  It was perfect.
     However, the ray of sunshine that was beaming on me was not there on September 29th.  While driving through Frankfort, Kentucky, I was struck from behind by a Ford Taurus that hydroplaned into me at 75 miles per hour.  I never saw it coming.  When it hit me, it knocked me into a Mazda MX6 in front of me, and I bounced between the two cars before we finally came to a stop.
     When I first purchased my Metro, I hoped against hope that I would never be involved in a serious accident in it, because I knew deep down that I wouldn't walk away from it.  But I was wrong.  I walked away from the accident with minor injuries.  What's more, we were able to drive it home to Pike County, after wiring a few things together.  It wasn't a pleasant ride, since the frame was bent and everything, but it went, and we didn't have to pay for a wrecker to haul it there for us.
     Fortunately for me, the person who hit me had incredible insurance, and they offered to pay me more for my car than I had originally paid for it.  I could choose any car I wanted within the amount they paid me.  And what did I choose.  I bought another Metro.  However, this time, I decided to go with the '97 4-door Metro Sedan, simply because I wanted a little more room, since I plan on traveling a lot more.  The car is perfect, from the purple paint to the unbeatable gas mileage.  And believe me, being able to put my perfect car on the road (including tax and license) for $5,000 didn't hurt matters either!  (By the way, if you live anywhere near Pike County, Kentucky, and you're looking for a car, check with Fletcher &amp; Halls.  They're incredible!  Ask for James Mullins!)<br><br>
