            The Sony MVC-FD91 was selected for use within my military police organization for many reasons.  First and foremost, the camera stores images on 1.44MB 3.5ï¿½ floppy disks rather than requiring any cable connection to a computer.  This allows for the immediate use of the images, whether for e-mail, web graphics, crime scene documentation or mug shots of offenders.  This interface is simple, quick, and easy for even the most novice user.  Quality of the images is outstanding, either in 640x480 VGA or 1024x768 XGA pixel resolutions, or the video record mode, which records in the MPEG standard for up to 60 seconds.  The camera offers steady shot technology to smooth out the image for those with unsteady hands, long battery life with the included Lithium battery, a quick access 2x floppy drive, and the included photo editing software is easy to install and use, putting it on the top of our list.

This camera is the same size as a standard 35mm camera, but the 14x optical zoom is pin sharp, as opposed to some digital zoom cameras where detail is lost in higher zoom settings.  It offers manual focus, however I have not come across a situation that the auto-focus could not handle.  If you are looking for an absolute easy camera to use, this is the one for you.
