            My brother got a new nice promotion to operations manager where he works, so he wanted to spend a bit and buy my parents a nice Christmas gift.  We're not a family who has ever had a lot of money to spend on Christmas, so anything over $200 is considered to be a very nice gift.  

My mom, I love her to death and she tries really hard, is one of the most computer inept persons I know.  She loves playing on it, and sometimes I think she loves seeing how much she can screw it up.  I get a call about once a month asking "will you come and fix my computer?"  So when my brother said he was going to buy my parents a digital camera for Christmas, I thought "here we go again!"

He chose the Fuji MX-1200.  It's a relatively inexpensive and durable digital camera.  I was very surprised.  And I haven't gotten any calls to "come and fix the digital camera".  

<b>Pros</b>

It's lightweight.  We can take it almost everywhere we go and snap nice, crisp clear pictures.  You have three settings on picture sharpness, soft, hard or normal.  You also have three choices on picture quality - normal, basic and fine.

You can also choose file size - two options 1280 x 960, or 640 x 480.  I chose to use the 640 x 480 due to the fact that I want the smaller files.

The date and time stamp can be placed on pictures, right down to the hour and minute.  The camera will beep through the settings and you can adjust the volume of the beep from high, low to turning it off completely.

It has a display screen so you can see the pictures as you take them.  You can either choose to save after you preview or set the settings where you just take pictures.  It's your choice as the user which you prefer.  I find that I use both - depending on what kind of time frame I'm in - if I'm trying to hurry I use the point and shoot.  If I've got time to shoot and reshoot, I choose the preview option.

It has a self timer - a fact that I love because I like taking pictures with me in them!  We can take the camera with a tripod on trips and everyone gets to be in the photos.  It also has a setting where you can preview the picture and then decide if you want to keep that shot (you have to push a button to save) and then it also has a point and shoot setting as well.

<b>Cons</b>

Invest in Duracell! The stock rises with every purchase of this camera.  I have found several times when I have "new" batteries but this camera doesn't like them.  Apparently it can tell the difference between new and fresh batteries.  It prefers them to be new and fresh - don't try to use any ones that were not bought at the store over two months ago or they won't work.  Save those for your cd players and TV remotes!

I don't have a power cord with this camera.  I don't know if it just didn't come with one, or my mother lost it.  I borrow the camera fairly often.  My mother keeps everything in a nice large ziplock baggie - there's no powercord.  It definitely would be a nice item to have with this camera.  Storage is also 1.3 megapixels.

I've also noticed that the display shows pictures a bit lighter than they actually download.  That makes it hard to judge when deciding if a photo is a keeper or not.

All in all, for $250, my brother got a great deal on a Christmas present for the parents.  They love the ease of use.  Mostly they like the point and click setting.  They leave the timers, preview display stuff for my brother and I to deal with.  

So if you're looking for an easy to use, yet decent quality digital camera, I would recommend the Fuji MX-1200.  We bought this Christmas of 2000, so I'm sure there probably better ones for cheaper out there on the market now, but I still like this camera a lot.

Thanks for reading my review!
