            We were recently searching for SUVs and find this the best luxury SUV for the money.  The Acura SUV has more room (a tiny 3rd row to seat an extra 2-3 kids).. but the Lexus is the best value.  I was able to get the price down to just a couple hundred dollars over invoice.. while the Acura was over sticker. (OUCH)

This SUV has all the extras, it rides more like a car (since it is based on a Camry frame)...It comes in alot of colors... and I recommend this car for a family car or for a female who does not like the drive of a truck.  It is a really smooth drive.. in both the four wheel and 2 wheel drive.

For your BEST VALUE, get the 2WD with the Premium Plus package... they are able to deal with this down under 34,000.... plus tax/tags.  Not bad for a 37,500 sticker and 33,500 invoice!

The cargo space is good for a getaway.. there is an option of a navigation system (for an extra 2000) that has the streets for the whole US on its DVD.  So it can plot your directions from A to B.  It is not worth the extra money for me.. but if your travel extensively with this car, this may be a lifesaver.

I recommend it for the value and for the ability to retain its value.  Excellent and very dependable..
