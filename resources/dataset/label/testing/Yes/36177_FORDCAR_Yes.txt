            I took one look at the Ford Focus ZX-3(hatch back), and thought &quot;That can't be a Ford&quot;.  But a Ford it is my dear friends and neighbors!!!
The Focus looks fun just sitting there, with a sexy sleek front end and lines any airplane designer would be proud of.
You don't drive this little big car as much as wear it.  Climb on in and you will find firm yet comfortable seats with the ability to raise or lower in height.  Side bolsters offer additional support and will keep you in place when you're whipping this little tiger around the twisties.
several engine options are available, save yourself from having to make a decision:  get the ZTECH 2.0 liter DOHC with the 5-speed manual transmission.  It turns the Focus into a ROCKET!  Controls are all within easy reach and are located exactly where they should be.  You won't find yourself searching for buttons or dials, just look down and there they are. I upgraded to the cd player and boy I'm glad i did.  It sounds like a big money system with clear highs and plenty of thump in the lows. turn on the automatic volume control and the dang thing turns itself up or down to compensate for ambient road noise.
If you want a sporty car without sacrificing comfort and trunk/storage space, then take a test drive.  Then look at the sticker.  Then look again and it will be hard not to seriously consider this car.<br><br>
