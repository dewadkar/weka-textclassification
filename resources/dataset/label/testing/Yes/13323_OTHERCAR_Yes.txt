            I have a UK version of the Subaru Forester AWP - whether this is any different from the US version, I have no idea!  I wanted a practical car with 4WD abilities that wasn't like the usual school-run posers (here in the UK most off roaders are used for ferrying kids to school and never see a bit of mud).  I, on the other hand have dogs and horses and my kids make their own way to school!  The Forester seemed to fit the bill in all respects and I was finally tempted by a substantial discount offered for a brand new 'old' model as the new one reaches our shores (ï¿½2,500 off new price).
I have found the handling to be excellent for a 4WD with hardly any body roll, as was evident in the other SUVs I tried.  It grips likes a limpet round corners and fuel consumption is reasonable, although I'd like to see an improvement here.  I have managed 30mpg on a combined run, but the usual is around 27-28mpg - this is mainly short runs around country lanes.  The more I drive this car the more I like it, the main gripes I would say are the cheap quality plastics inside and lack of leg room for rear seat passengers.  However since I don't often carry passengers the latter isn't too much of a problem. 
Please note the price paid is in GB pounds sterling.
