            I was in the market for a new, dependable car at the end of 2001.  I had to find something affordable, though, because I had a large rollover of negative equity in my trade-in.  I loved the new line of body styles that Hyundai was coming out with.  The Santa Fe was my favorite, but not affordable for me because of the rollover.  I had to find something else less expensive.  Like I said, Hyundai has some great looking cars now, and the warranty is unbeatable.  I researched extensively into other SUVs and Sedans to see what was the best I could get for my money (with a rollover).  I did not want to get back into something that was going to plummet in value again.  I researched into depreciation values and found that the Sonata had a slower depreciation rate than the Accord and Camry.  That was surprising!  The sticker price was significantly lower, too ($17,000, compared to $20,000 and up for Honda & Toyota).  I went to the closest dealer to test drive the Sonata.  I was so pleased by the ride and the comfort.  It was smaller inside than what I was used to driving, so that took some getting used to, but that didn't take long.  I love the car now.  At first I was planning on finding something economical to trade-in in a few years for an SUV.  I think I will keep this one for a while, though.  The model I got was the base, but it has almost everything on it that the mid-model has.  I have the sunroof, power everything, cd player, etc.  All of this is standard except the sunroof.  The engine is the 24 valve, DOHC, V6.  Being that the car is fairly light in weight in comparison to other sedans, the engine performs superbly!  I really have to watch myself.  The interior is beautiful and the instruments are easy to read.  The seating is very comfortable; the stereo sound is awesome.  The exterior view of the car is amazing.  I parked next to a Mercedes the other day and except for the hood ornament, the cars looked identical.  I have heard that people often compare the Sonata body style to the Jaguar and Infiniti.  I feel that I am driving a very classy car now for a lot less than the classy car price.  People's heads turn when my car is nearby - I have seen it myself!  They are especially surprised when I tell them it is a Hyundai.  It really has come a long way in looks and dependability, yet they have kept the price down for people like me.
