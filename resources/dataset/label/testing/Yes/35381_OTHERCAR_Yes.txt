            Purchased new in 1992, this vehicle served us well for two years doing 75000kms.  In that time it required only normal service, one wheel alignment and one wheel balance.

A couple of very minor new car niggles were sorted out with the selling dealer immediately.  Product knowledge was obviously very high and the service manager was excellent.

We found the vehicle extremely capable despite ours being only the 2WD version.  At high speeds it remained as stable as a cruise missile regardless of the road or weather conditions.  It was totally unaffected by even strong cross winds, something I found quite remarkable.  A trip down through the back of NSW over roads with 1 metre wide pot holes littering the surface, found nothing lacking and the vehicle could hit them at 100kph without any signs of concern.

Fuel economy was very good considering the size of the vehicle with no trouble getting 600kms cruising range out of the tank.

Little things also counted like the very well organized engine bay with all essential items identified by yellow.

My only criticism of the car was its high speed noise level from the engine which was doing over 3500RPM at 100kph.  Ours was a 5 speed manual and I think the auto would have been a better choice as it's gearing is quite different.

Extremely sorry to sell, we had to move on due to a change in circumstances and have regretted it ever since.

Here in Australia, the car is sold as the Liberty.
