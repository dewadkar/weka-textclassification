            I have owned and driven numerous sports and high performance cars and felt that I wasn't going to be able to have speed and luxury in a domestic luxury auto..... and then I rented an Aurora which led to the purchase of one just a short time later.  I got plush leather for my real estate clients and the kid in me got the performance I thought I was going to miss.  The 24 valve dual overhead cam v-8 is the same engine that Caroll Shelby used when he built his own vehicle ( I was told, and is the same V-8 used in the Indy cars) and the northstar system out of the Cadillac made the ride that much more quiet, enjoyable and responsive.  The radio and heater controls in the steering wheel are of the same type that I got used to in my old Nissan 300ZX.  While the ZX had great speed it doesn't compare to the top end of the Aurora.  The trunk is large enough to hold 2 full sets of golf clubs and bags with extra storage to spare.  Individual climate controls for the passenger and driver allow for a really comfortable environment for 2 and yet there are additional controls for the rear passengers.  At 6'3'' I easily fit into the drivers seat and have easy access to all of the other controls.  The information computer provides all of the newest in digital readouts provided by other luxury cars and the hands free phone system only adds to the class of this automobile.  
I would highly recommend this auto for anyone who has a need for getting clients from one place to another in a truly good looking comfortable ride, and, if you want to take on that 500 series Beamer you've got lots of power to do it with.<br><br>
