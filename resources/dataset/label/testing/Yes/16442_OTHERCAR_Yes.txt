            I really wanted a new digital camerra to go with my new pc.
I wanted something that was good enough to make some quality pictures but wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg so I reviewed many products...
I am glad I took my time to read some reviews and see how diferent models 
worked and compaired to each other,the result of my patience is that I was fortunate enough to get exactly what I wanted from Santa a little early this year,meaning I didn't even have to pay for it.


This digital toy suited me perfectly and the price was reasonable(i was told,hahaha)...
-easy!!! operation
-lots of little options to play with
-8mb
-2.1 mega's 
-3x optical
-1.6 in monitor
-great download time
-good battery life...
-fast usb download

and importantly it supports rechargable batteries(some manufacturers do not support) of which I always carry extras.

Want's include:
-Case 
-power adapter
