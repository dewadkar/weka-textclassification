               I am a 45 years old businessman who lives in Mexico and I had been saving for about eight years for something great and out of common. Once I finished saving casually I visited the Ferrari shop and once I saw the 456 GT I could not resist and I bought it.
   I love everything about the car, but what I like the most is the sound of the engine going at 140 mph.
   Driving this vehicle is a new and exciting experience every time you do it, a new adventure each day, and the others just can resist turning their heads just to stare at you with certain envy and admiration.
   If you are a man around 40 or 50 and you think you have lived every possible adventure, just try this babe, you will feel in paradise.<br><br>
