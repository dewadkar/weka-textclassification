            This car is awesome, the Land Cruiser is one of the most reliable cars on the market today, I am npot lieing to you, if you are intrested in this car go out and buy it, I love this car to death. It is so reliable and it is good off road, Its not awwesome off road, because it is more of a family car, but it can take a little bit of a beating.


It handles great and its turning radius is HUGE. I love this car, it has goopd acceleration and anything you would want in a car. the only negative thing about this car is the price. It is a little on the high side, like any other Toyata is, but you get what you pay for, and you get one hell of a car.
