            I was very sad when Canon stopped making this camera.  I bought mine just before they stopped making it, and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to buy it just then.  The newer powershots are larger and bulkier, though they offer higher quality images.  This camera was a great deal for the price, excellent make, quality of the pictures, and features offered.

I did a lot of research before I decided to buy a new digital camera.  I had gotten a raw deal the last time I bought one, and was very unhappy with that purchase, so I was not about to be taken for a ride again.  The fact that this camera has a multitude of camera settings from high, medium and low quality to large, medium and small picture size, to panorama, timed flash and continuous shooting was excellent.  Since it was tied together in a tiny little package with a color display (that could be turned off when not needed), rechargeable battery (not included) and CF Type I and Type II slots, it made the decision to buy a no-brainer.

My major complaints with the camera lie in the inability to turn off the display in "IMAGE" mode.  This is the camera mode I use most often, since it has a "Fast Shutter" setting that I use for taking pictures of children.  Pictures of blurry flailing baby limbs were causing us to be dissatisfied with our last camera, an Olympus semi-pro circa 1998.  There doesn't seem to be any setting to turn it off, you simply have to wait 2-3 seconds for the camera to set itself up, then depress the "display" button twice to turn it off.  I've found that holding down the "display" button will turn it off more quickly, if you catch the camera before it starts initializing.

The other thing that bothers me is that to display a picture of the photo you have just taken, you must continue to depress the shutter button.  I frequently forget to do that, and end up having to turn the camera on to see the picture in question.  On the flip side, you don't <b>have</b> to see every picture you take, so it conserves battery.

I have also noticed that the camera "forgets" what setting you were on last in the "IMAGE" mode, ie: red-eye, flash, no flash, etc.  This was a royal pain when we were in a dark aquarium and I was attempting to take nightscape pictures without the flash.  The flash came on automatically and I would take a picture first without checking the settings - and the flash would go off.

For all it's downsides, this camera has at least ten times as many great features.  It takes excellent pictures in bright, outdoor light.  It has beautiful contrast and takes wonderful pictures, regardless of my skill (which is to say I'm not very skillful with a camera).  The buttons are easy to read and the flow of the camera buttons and switches are easy to figure out, once you read the manual.  I often find it difficult when I lend it to others to take pictures of us, but I simply set it to the right settings, and give them the "Hold the shutter button down halfway and wait for the chirp, then press it down the rest of the way".  That makes it easy enough, since I'm the one that mainly takes all the pictures.  It also has many different settings, from fast shutter, to slow shutter (great for fireworks or purposely making trails), to nightscape and everything in between.

This camera is sturdy as a workhorse, and has not failed even though it has gotten wet and been dropped numerous times by our toddler.  It's heavy enough that it's not skimpy, but it's light enough that it's not a nuisance to carry around.  It's well made, and I expect it to last a very long time, even if the megapixels are out of date.

I had to rate the battery life "Poor", since it only lasts through a set of about 50 pictures.  However, I don't think that's a fair estimate.  I will take 3-5 pictures, turn on the camera, show them to everyone and delete the ones we don't like.  Repeat that over and over again for 50 pictures.  That's more like 200 exposures!  A word of warning, the rechargeable battery and charger are sold separately unless explicitly noted, but it's worth the extra money.

If you have the opportunity to buy this used anywhere and it's about the same price as a new one of comparable megapixels, BUY IT.  This camera is a beauty.  I absolutely love it!
