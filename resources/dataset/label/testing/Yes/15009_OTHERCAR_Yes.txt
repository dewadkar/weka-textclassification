            I bought this camera because it is so simple to use and it's super
10x zoom, which is the same as a 40x400 in a 35mm camera.
I really like using floppy disks for storing images. Very cheap
and you can make copies in the camera with out a computer.
It has so many options, color, sepia and black and white.
Another nice option is that it accepts 37mm lens filters. Since it
has such an awful lens cap, I bought a skylight filter for
10.95 to protect the lens and put the cap away. you can also buy
all kinds of special effect filters.It reminds you of a 35mm slr
without the film to buy or have developed
As you can see I really love this camera.
