            Highly recommended for those who want to record the important moments.  People who think they can use a digital camera and still be a professional photographer should get the Nikon Coolpix 990.  If you are a professional photographer, you should be looking at the high-end Kodak cameras.

I've used the Nikon Coolpix 950 and 990 for work through most of 2000, but the camera I purchased for myself was the DSC-P1.  For me, it offered just about everything that I used in the 990 albeit in a much smaller form factor.  Working with the larger cameras, I realized that portability was very important to me.

The camera's pretty small, and always manages to turn heads.  Image quality is very good at 3.3 megapixels, easily comparable to the 990.  Build quality is very good - sturdy, compact, with very few &quot;breakable&quot; protrusions.  Not that you'd want to drop anything that costs $800.  The 3x optical zoom is pretty decent too, with little barrel distortion.  These are the camera's greatest strengths.

Typical of other Sony &quot;gadget&quot; hardware, the DSC-P1 has a plethora of gimmicky features, including the ability to record MPEG1 movies, output straight to a TV (both audio and video) via RCA cable, and various special effect (Program AE, just like their camcorders) filters.  Most of these are pretty fun to play with, however in practice they are not that useful for when it counts.  Despite having an inferior video recording capability, it is very cool that such a small solid state device can do it in the first place.  Its too bad there isn't any MP3 feature - the hardware seems perfect for it with a built in volume control, speaker, and audio out (via the TV out port).  I disabled the digital zoom when I first powered on the camera - I don't belive in digital zoom, never have and never will.  

In my opinion, the fact that it is a Sony is both its best and worst aspect.  Because its Sony there's a level of quality that is easy to notice and appreciate.  Also because its Sony it uses proprietary InfoLithium batteries and Memory Sticks.

The InfoLithium battery is pretty good, actually - comparable in lifetime to many batteries out on the market.  You get about 1 hour and 20 minutes of continuous use with the battery, and can recharage whenever and and as many times as you want, just by plugging the supplied power cord in.

Memory Stick is another matter.  Yes, it does look kinda sexy, but is limited by lack of competitors since it is proprietary.  64mb is the largest size you can get, and they aren't too cheap (about $150 for the 64mb).  This is in comparison to other storage media, such as microdrives or CompactFlash ($115 for 64mb).  If it were available, I would've gone out and gotten the 256mb.  The camera comes with an 8mb card, one of the worst rip-offs ever for a currently brand-new digital camera.  You can put about 6 pictures on 8 mb.  If you have a Vaio computer you can just plug in the memory stick - nice... USB connection works very similar - the software just treats the camera as a removable drive - also very nice.

The camera is strictly high-end amateur.  There is no manual focus, and you cannot attach lenses to it.  That's perfect for me.  I want to record the important moments in my life, so this little wonder that fits in my jacket pocket is great.  If you're attaching zoom lenses and stuff to a camera, you're going to need a tripod, and lots of light anyways, so the portability aspect of a camera loses its importance.  I've found in practice that I never used those extra aspects anyways with the Nikon cameras.  <br><br>
