            BMW's don't call themselves The Ultimate Driving Machine for nothing.  Trust me, they're certainly able to put their money where their mouth is.

I strolled into my local BMW dealership looking for an appropriate model to test-drive, and spied a 330i that was practically begging me to take it out and thrash it a little.  For those of you not in the means to purchase a BMW (like me), getting a test drive just for the heck of it is a considerable proposition.  So I'll give you the quick and dirty instructions on how to do it.  It worked for me.

First, get a haircut.  If you're trying to grow a beard or mustache, lose it.  Get real cleaned up and go in wearing something that looks expensive, yet still classy.  (Note: Tommy Hilfiger logo shirts and baggy pants may be expensive, but they are NOT classy.  Try a polo shirt and khakis, along with a pair of clean shoes).  A bit of acting will come into play, because these people have to sniff out poseurs all the time, and they are good at it.  If you can't pull of the "I've got more money than I know what to do with" attitude, then just get back in your beat-up Honda Civic now and go home.  And if you do have a junker for a car, try to avoid being seen around it until you leave.  That said, on to the actual car.

The 330i is changed somewhat from last year's 328 in several ways, including a larger-displacement inline-six (up to 3 liters from last year's 2.8), bigger brakes, some trim pieces, and the addition of all-wheel drive as an option.  My test car was well-equipped, (and should be for over 40 grand) and included such things as power seats, leather, automatic wipers, and a power moonroof.  The sport package was also on my car, which gave it a more aggressive wheel and tire combination, performance-tuned shocks, and a subtle aerodynamics package.  (One of my deepest regrets is never learning to drive a stick.  You should've seen the look the sales guy gave me.)

The interior of the car is very driver-oriented, and once you turn the key, you'll be glad for it.  The 3-liter straight six is the smoothest powerplant I've ever sampled in my entire short life.  It's responsive, while at the same time conducts its business with all the style and class of a Wall Street tycoon.  Out on the road the engine makes its presence known.  Stomping on the throttle produces a confident surge from beneath the hood (and a disdainful look from the sales staff) as the car surges ahead.  Keep it to the floor, and 60 MPH will flash by in just over 6 seconds.  At speed on the highway, the car feels solid, as if built out of a single huge billet of metal.  This would make a great getaway car for a weekend trip for two.  I could sit in those seats for hours and not get tired.  The back seat, on the other hand..I don't think so.  While the seats themselves are very comfortable, there isn't much room back there.  You can carry 4 people in relative comfort, but make sure the tallest guy gets shotgun, or there might be a problem.

Off the highway and on meandering city streets the Bimmer gets noticed.  This is not a car to use to disappear quietly into the night, nor is it a car to use to take the kids to soccer practice.  This thing turns more heads than a screwdriver.  It's undoubtedly a car for posturing, and undeniably a status symbol. But what a symbol!  This car practically oozes style from every square inch of sheetmetal, and is instantly recognizable from most any distance.

But where this car really shines is on a twisty road.  This would've been the perfect day if I could've found a good backroad to flog the Bimmer on.  Sadly, my test run was cut short before I was able to properly test the car's reportedly amazing handling characteristics.  Perhaps another time...Such is life, I suppose.

This car had me grinning from ear to ear the entire time I was in it, and for the majority of the day afterwards.  The salesman, no doubt, was praying he'd never see me again after that little stunt in the parking lot.  I dunno about that...
