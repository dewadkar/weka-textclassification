            During most of 1999 I worked at a Mazda dealership and even though I am no longer employed in the automotive industry I still find the Mazda product line to be a top market choice.  I had the luxury of driving both a 1999 as well as a 2000 model Protege for my dealer demonstrator.  I personally recommend the the LX model with a manual transmission.  With a spoiler added, this gives the vehicle a sporty look and feel as you drive down the highway.  The current model year [beginning with 1998 models] came with a standard AM/FM CD stereo with an optional cassette deck available.  I don't think that anybody who drives the Protege will find themselves disappointed.<br><br>
