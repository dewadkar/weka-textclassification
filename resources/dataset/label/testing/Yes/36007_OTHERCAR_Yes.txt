            I recently got this camera as a gift and I would have to say that upon my first reaction I was simply amazed. 
I believe that there is no other camera in this price range that is equivalent to this camera, period. Sony hits the digital camera market right on the head with the dsc-p20, for the price it has more/better features that will simply amaze you. First off you start with a simple digital camera that is much like every other camera on the market. You get a simple compact design, 1.3 mega pixels with up to 1216x912 resolution, built in flash, very clear lcd screen, simple to use buttons and dials and a menu that is easier to use than your microwave. Now what amazes me about this camera isn't its simplicity, its what's on the inside that counts. The other capabilities of this camera include the capabilities to record mpeg movies(which i use all the time), you get built in effects, you can change the picture size right on the lcd screen, you can rotate the pics that turn out sideways or upside down, and all of this can be done right on your lcd screen. If all of the above features weren't enough they make transferring the pictures to your computer incredibly simple. The camera comes with a disc that comes loaded with all the software you need to edit, save, build slide shows etc. and it also comes with drivers for both mac and pc. I can't say much about the software programs that the camera comes with because I use photoshop most of the time, but as far as the drivers go in my mac, they work flawless. Its as simple as loading the drivers on to your computer then plugging the camera in and instantly your memory stick appears on the desktop, voila!, thats it. Not once while using this camera did I feel confused and feel I had to refer to the manual, everything is right in the on screen menu. The one problem I did encounter with this camera is batteries. You must get the lithium ion rechargable batteries to use this camera, sure you can use standard AA batteries but in normal picture mode I found they wont last you any longer than 15 minutes, in two days I went through 6 batteries(it takes 2 at a time). So whatever you do I recommend you get the cybershot stamina value kit which is definitely worth its price of 99.99, you get a carry case, charger/dc adapter, and one battery(the battery alone sells for $60). Sony's part number for the kit is ACC-CSPW, buy it you'll thank me later. Anyways, I would have to say all in all I am very pleased with the performance that this camera delivers, I believe it surpasses the "low end" market as all sony cameras do.
