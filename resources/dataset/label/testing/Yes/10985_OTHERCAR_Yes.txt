            I bought this car used in September of 2002 and when I got it the paint job was near perfect except for a few gravel chips in the front grill.  There was very little rust under the engine and it was working generally fine.  Then came the winter and we were driving home from a movie down a split 4 lane highway in the middle of a horrible blizzard at 1 in the morning.  Then out of the corner of my husband's eye a huge 6 point buck came running in front of us and smashed right into the bumper in front of the passenger's side.  I saw a leg go over and we kept barreling down the highway for fear that someone wouldn't see us and hit us, a stopped car.  So about 5 minutes down the road we checked the damage.  To our amazement the deer only crunched the headlight and pushed in the hood of out car leaving a neat and tidy deer butt print.  

We called the cops so they could clean up the mess on the road and we kept on going.  The car, small though it is, stood up to a duel with a large beast.  

Parts were pretty easy to find we called down to a local wrecker and they had a couple Colts in stock and we were able to get the headlight and casing replaced without any trouble for only $75.  

Overall I'm very pleased with this little car.  Very much an economy, starter car but really we only paid $800 CAN and we hadn't had to do much in the way of repairs on it.  patch a muffler here oil change there.  And it's not like we just stay in town with the thing.  We've probably put 25 000 KM on it in the past year going back and forth from Toronto and Ottawa from a small town in between on the St. Lawrence.  

Has a really bad stereo system though and the belts squeal in the winter occasionally also the engine is a little wimpy for the highway and off the line but I didn't buy a sports car, did I?  As for the stereo the antenna keeps getting lose and there doesn't seem to be much we can do to fix it but I've got enough sing along songs in my head to get me all the way across the country if needs be. "Fish and chips and vinegar, vinegar,..."
