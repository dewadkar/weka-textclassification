            Gotta love this new revamped design.  The previous Odyssey was not quite a mini van.  The redesign of this reliable Honda is just what larger families have been anxiously awaiting for!  It seats 7 adults very comfortably!  It's interior is more spacious than it's competitors.  This great mini-van handles so easy, you'd swear you were driving an Accord.  The hide-a-way back seat is such a C@@L feature.  My 8 and 11 yr olds love to hide the seat away (they can do this all by themselves) and put their bikes in back to go to the park.  There are a couple of drawbacks to this mini-van.  1. I've been averaging around 15 mpg/ city which is not as good as I was hoping for from a Honda.  Given the larger engine and all I guess I can't expect 30 mpg like we get in our Civic.  2.  There were some initial problems with the brakes (squealing) but that has since been fixed.  3.  The sound system stinks!  There is just no other way to put this nicely.  I miss the high quality system in my Town &amp; Country.  In spite of the drawbacks,  I would highly recommend the Honda Odyssey for anyone looking to buy a new mini-van.<br><br>
