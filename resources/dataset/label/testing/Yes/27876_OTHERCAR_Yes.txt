             Since 1968, Toyota has been building Corollas and I never was interested in these cars, until now. After buying GM cars since I could drive, I would have never expected to find a Toyota in my driveway. Sick of working on my wife's 1992 Toronado, I wanted a brand new car that was reliable and had a good warranty. An import. The first car I checked out was a '02 Hyundai Elantra GLS. I was impressed by the list of standard features and that great warranty. But when I read the fine print about the warranty, I learned that I would have to get my oil changed at the dealer and I decided to look elsewhere for a car. After looking at Hondas and Nissans I finally found the car I was looking for, a brand new 2002 Toyota Corolla. $12,500 later I netted a dark teal Corolla CE with air and an automatic transmission.

The Exterior:
The exterior looks fairly bland but is not ugly. It justs looks like any other car on the road. The sheet-metal is essentially the same from back in '92 but it was revised in 2001 with a larger grill and different tail-lights and doesn't look dated at all.

The Interior:
The Corolla's interior looks pleasant and modern with user-friendly controls. My Corolla is the basic CE model with crank windows and manual locks. If you can't roll a window down or manually lock a door you probably shouldn't be driving anyway. It did come equipped with A/C and a good sounding cassette player with four speakers. The front seats are comfortable, the back seat is a tight squeeze. Interior fit and finish is good and the materials don't look that cheap.

The Engine:
All Corollas are powered by a 1.8L DOHC inline four cylinder that provides 125hp and 125lb-ft. torque. The engine is fairly smooth and quiet at low RPMs but becomes thrashy and loud at high RPMs. That didn't surprise me because that is just the nature of four cylinders. My Corolla is equipped with a dated three speed automatic that isn't known for it's quiet or smooth shifts but actually works very well. The manual tranny gets 41 MPG, the auto gets around 35 MPG on the highway. Performance is average and you won't risk slow lane banishment.
 
 The Corolla really impressed me and although it does nothing excellent, it does everything well.
