             After owning this car for over a year, I can say it was one of my best buys. I bought the car used with 103K miles on it from a company that used it for sales. (highway miles) It did not have power windows,seats, etc. This is what I was looking for.
 Less moving parts equals less problems and it seems I was right.
 I put new brake rotors on the front of the car due to a pulsing brake pedal right after I bought it. Also a fuel filter. Other than that, the car now has in excess of 130K miles on it with out a problem. Regular oil/filter changes has been the only input into the vehicle. 
 My wife loves the car, it has been on several 400+ mile trips and is driven daily to work. It is very quiet and stable on the highway even cruising at 78mph. New Michelin tires might have helped there. No squeaks, buzzes or rattles. Stereo is even quit good with front, back and side speakers.
 The gas mileage has been consistent at 29mpg and uses no oil.
  The seats are large and was comfortable for a 6ft 4inch gentleman. Even the back seats are spacious compared to foreign cars. The trunk seems large enough to lease as an apartment.
 I can't think of a better family four door sedan. This has been the best car I have owned to date.
