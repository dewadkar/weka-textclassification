            My wife and I selected the Toyota Solara after test driving the Honda Accord (2 and 4 doors) the Volkswagen Passat, and the Camry and the Lexus IS 300.  After all was said and done, we selected for the following reasons
Each  applies to the Model we selected: the SLE V6

- Toyota&#146s Reputation
- Sporty Good Looks
- Available Options
- Safety Features
- Comfort
- &#147Vibe&#148

<b>Toyota&#146s Reputation</b> is a stellar one. They are renowned for their mechanical reliability, quality of craftsmanship, lack of defects, and styling. Having owned a Celica previously, and absolutely cherishing that car (it had the most comfortable seats of any car I had ever driven). I came to the Solara after driving a Mercedes Benz, and winced at the maintenance costs of owning the German car. We also recognized that the Honda&#146s have a great reputation for reliability, and the Passat &#150 while more reliable than it&#146s little brother, the Jetta &#150 seemed to have the most issues. Since my long commute means I use up the warranty in year one, I need the assurance that I am purchasing a solid reliable car.

<b>Sporty Good Looks</b> The car is plain and simple a looker. Especially when you consider that it&#146s a Camry underneath it all. We really wanted something that was reliable, but wasn&#146t boring. As fans of the bygone Lexus SC300, there were styling hints that harkened back to that luxury Toyota that we found appealing. This was particularly apparent in the understated rear spoiler. While I&#146m no fan of the spoiler, I typically find them useless and garish, and most cars are best left without them, the spoiler on the Solara is a small &#147tab&#148 that follows the line of the trunk and extends the top of the trunk back a few inches. If the car were moving fast, it might first make you think that it was a &#147blur&#148. The SC300 had this same spoiler, and it really made the car look sporty.  Furthermore, the Solara is simple and more rounded than the Accord. The Accord 2 Door, in particular was very angular. My wife was also turned off by the rather &#147bubbly&#148 look of the Passat, which was the least sporty looking of the bunch.

<b>Availaible options</b> The SLE V6 really stood out here.  We were considering the IS 300, but it&#146s base price pretty much started where the Solara Topped out, so the choice between a base IS 300, and the loaded Solara was pretty easy. Inside, the Solara is far larger that the IS 300, and the rear legroom is phenomenal. I believe, although I cannot confirm that the Solara my have greater rear legroom than the 4 Door Camry of the same year. Perhaps it&#146s an illusion, but it sure felt that way. We also optioned up to the  V6 engine. This gives the Solara a significant 200 HP &#150 essentially identical to the Accord. This gives the Solara quite a bit of pep, especially when getting on the highway, and passing on hills. While this engine does not lack power, it is still slower than the souped-up Jetta VR6, and the IS 300. I&#146m not a speed demon, but I do appreciate a car that will giddyup when I ask it too, and the Solara does just that. It also came with Power windows, door locks, keyless entry and a power drivers seat with adjustable lumbar support add to the comfort options inside the car. Our version featured leather seats &#150 which are very easy to keep clean (Even windex works on the seats), and after 2 years of daily use, and outside parking show <b>absolutely no</b> signs of wear. We also opted for the upgraded JBL sound system, which is among the best factory installed systems I haven encountered in a car &#150 particularly one at this price point. It&#146s way better than the Bose System in my mothers Infiniti, and beats the heck out of anything I&#146ve heard in domestic offerings.  I do not recall the sound systems in the Accord or Passat, but it&#146s usually something I consider closely in a car since I drive so much, so unmemorable is unimpressive.  There is also wood trim on the interior that adds some class and is reminiscent of the trim in the more luxurious Lexus, only there is less of it.  It also comes with a factory installed security system. There is also a power moon roof, which is amply sized and easy top operate &#150 and relatively quiet &#150 even without the optional wind deflector

<b>Saftey</b> Along with Toyota&#146s great reputation for reliability, is it&#146s safety record. Toyota makes a safe car. And the SLE V6 continues that tradition with a gamut of safety features. These features include: dual front seat air bags, dual front seat side air bags, traction control, anti-lock brakes, fog lamps, reinforced doors, and a breakaway engine. I thought the breakaway engine was a great concept, in the event of a significant frontal impact, the engine is designed to break away and fall out the bottom of the car, rather than get pushed into the passenger compartment, potentially hurting legs or feet. The security system on the car also features a &#147panic&#148 mode that when pressed sounds he horn and flashes the lights. The sum combination of all these safety features garnered me hefty savings on my car insurance, which was an unexpected plus. There are also shoulder betls for all passengers, including three in the back. I&#146ve never put a childs seat in this car, but there appear to be tether staps on the back deck for securing those seats.

<b>Comfort</b> - I put nearly 40 thousand miles a year on my cars, so comfort is of paramount importance.  If you read some of my other reviews, you&#146ll know I&#146m a fairly heavy guy at 240 lbs. This means that the seats have to be firm, comfortable and need to hold up to my weight for long periods. The Solara, as with other Toyotas fit the bill. The Drivers seat is highly adjustable it has good range front to back, the front and rear of the seat can be individually adjusted for height, the headrest is adjustable, the back is adjustable, and there is a lever to adjust the amount of lower lumbar (lower back) support.  The seat  has adequate grip to keep you from sliding from side to side, but I wish that the side lumbar support  and thigh supports were adjustable as they were on my mid eighties Celica. I also wish the lower back support were more adjustable. As it is, the lever either provide support, or not &#150 you really can&#146t get an in-between setting. On my old Celica, there were 3 individually adjustable air bladders that could be inflated using a bulb &#150 like a blood pressure cuff. Each bladder could be individually deflated to really tailor the support to where you needed it. Boy, do I miss those seats. Anyway, the Solara is still no slouch in the comfort department, it has plenty of headroom, both front and rear, and adult passengers who ride in the back consistently remark how roomy and comfortable it is. It&#146s a 2 door remember, so there is always a little extra effort getting in and out of the back seat. The back seat can also fold down to give access to the trunk via a hole about 14 by 24 inches. The center of the rear seat also folds out to be an armrest. There are cup holders for the front and rear seats.  While the rear passenger windows are very large, I just wish they rolled down. That would be an excellent feature to offer rear passengers. 

<b>Vibe</b> This is the &#145X&#146 Factor. After driving all of these cars &#150 the Solara, Accord, Passat, etc... you&#146ll get a vibe. You&#146ll like one more than the other. It&#146s a matter of personal preference really. Go with it. They&#146re all good, reliable cars, chose the one that fits your life and lifestyle the best. After all was said and done, we got the &#147Vibe&#148 form the Solara. It fit. It had that magical combination of comfort, style, and safety that made us say &#147oooh&#147 as we test drove it. We knew.  We just knew.

Now, if only our experience with the dealer was as good as the car. Unfortunately it wasn&#146t. I&#146ll never use that dealer again, and have all but sworn off buying cars from new-car dealers. To hear the whole sordid tale, read my review of my new favorite way to buy a car: Carmax. (<a href='/content_64863833732'>http://www.epinions.com/content_64863833732</a>)

After two years and 70 thousand miles, this car is rock solid. Do the regular maintenance, and you&#146ll be treated to years of satisfaction from this Toyota. The interior shows no wear, the engine hasn&#146t missed a step, and I&#146m still on the original tires! Save yourself a few bucks off a new car, and consider the 2000. You should be able to get a well cared for model between 16k and 19k (in October 02). It looks virtually the same as the 02's but it'll be more than 10 K less!
