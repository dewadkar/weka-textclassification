            I bought this car because it is affordable. Even though my car was a used car when I purchased it, it drives great and the only maintenance I have given to my car is the normal maintenance, oil change, filter change, etc....It is a well designed car, spacious, easy to drive. Looks expensive but it is not.  I have gotten many compliments from family and friends. The seats are very comfortable, my children love them.  Even though they get a bit of abuse from my three kids they stay in great shape, they are very easy to clean.  My car has standard features and basically it has all I need, air conditioner, dual airbags, and radio/cassette player.  It has good sound.  My only complain so far are the seatbealts, they don't give you much space to move forward they kind off choke you. but by far that is my only complain, I love my car and it well fits myself and my 3 children.  

P.S. I love the dual airbags,  I feel safe in my car, my children ride on the back and they have plenty of leg space. <br><br>
