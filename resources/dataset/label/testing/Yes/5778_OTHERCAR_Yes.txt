            This camera is more of a middle grade camera. For anywhere from $400-$499 it is not a top notch, nor the bottom of the barrel.  You get a compact and stylish camera with great optics.   Comfortable to use with one hand or two, and all the menus are very self-explanatory.  This camera also gives a nice wide-angle view. When shooting in low light I have found the quick focus preset features work great. You have upto 8 feet.  

<b>Included with purchase:</b>
A viewfinder diopter | Camedia desktop software | two disposable lithium cells | 2.1 megapixels | 1600 x 1200 resolution | 3x optical zoom lens |  2.5x digital telephoto (f2.8-4.4 aspherical glass zoom | TTL autofocus with 2 Quick Focus settings | built-in flash including red-eye reduction | optical viewfinder | QuickTime for small movies

<b>QuickTime Software:</b> This software allows you to make small mini-movies from your pictures. Although this camera will not allow you to playback the movies, you can only see the first frame. 

<b>Complications?</b> On this camera you will have to flip the flash up manually. The only reminder you have is a small orange LED light next to the viewfinder.  Although, this is not really that bad, I found that once I realized this, I remembered to do so all the times after. The other was, it is a serial port only, no USB connection.  With the serial connection, it is much slower. 

<b>The good side:</b> With full ability of point and shoot, like some cameras do offer, and with one had operation, it allows you to capture some great pictures quickly.  The memory card that comes with the camera allows for 36 pictures, with great quality. You will get some great quality photos from this camera. The zoom that you get with this camera offers a 3X optical zoom along with a 2X digital zoom.  

<b>For Window users:</b> the requirements are: Pentium or greater, Win 95/98/2000/NT 4.0, QuickTime             4.0 (software included), 32 MB RAM, 100 MB of hard drive space, CD-ROM, Standard RS-232 Interface and monitor with 256 or more colors.

With use, I have not experienced any downfalls, I am not a great photographer, I just love to take pictures of everything and anything. The camera was very easy to use; the software is very easy to follow when editing.  Like most people, I am the type to grab the camera and hurry and shoot not to miss the pose. So with one hand aim and shoot feature, this camera has really been good for that.  I usually carry it in an over the shoulder bag, with all my other toys, so the size wasn't a feature I was looking for. With the zoom and quality of pictures and the overall choices of : <b>SQ, SQ-HIGH, HQ, SHQ and SHQ-TIFF</b>, I had many choices of how I wanted to shoot my pictures.  

With reading some other's thoughts on the downside features, with my own personal use, I didn't experience complications. With the shuttle and viewfinder and such. It really depends on you and how you use your <b>"toys".</b>

This is a good camera for a beginner, setting out for their first purchase. Breaking yourself in on the how-to with digital cameras, you will soon learn what features you want and what you will stay away from, when you set out to buy another.
