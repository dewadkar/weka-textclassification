            Let's face it: if you've looked at spending $40k on a convertible, you have looked at other cars, too... and the Beemer seems the omni-present choice. But the Saab represents a great contrarian choice that acutally stands tall on its very own merits: it just works well, it has a distinct and timeless design, it is extremely comfortable inside, it does represent a nice compromise between cruiser and performance, it does offer decent economy, and it is very practical with 4 seats and decent storage space.

The engine feels somewhat gnarlier and less smooth than 6 cylinder offerings, especially the Beemers, but it has its very own endearing quality: very balanced and quiet when cruising, very showy when pushed, and it does offer very impressive real world acceleration. The interior is extremely comfortable and well sorted out. The leather of the seats is class-leading, but there's a bit too much cheapish plastic exposed to the touch. Spartan Swedish charm, and the car is class-leading in its lightness, which means it offers good performance and relative fuel efficiency if you mind the right foot and avoid the turbo rush.

The auto in my car is widely criticized in the press for being 4 gears, but I feel it goes well with the character of the car and the engine. The auto switches very smoothly, and the engine has a wide powerband that does not require frequent shifting. I had read some critique of the supposedly peaky engine character, which only offers power with the usual top-end turbo character - but it is my conviction that is not true at all. The engine pulls well and smoothly anywhere and anytime. It is extremely well-tuned for real-world requirements, I feel: it leaps forward whenever you floor the throttle anywhere between 20-70mph, and it is no slouch off the blocks, either. Again, maybe the auto is the better choice for this engine, and the "peaky" perception is a side-effect of a so-so manual gearing ratio. The way this engine combines power with fuel efficiency and very quiet cruising at highway speeds is pretty unique. Until recently, I owned a Jag XJR, which offered supercharged 370hp, but its a credit to the Saab I don't miss it much at all.

In general, it does offer a very distinct, and very endearing value proposition. It is softer than a German offering - which means that it does roll more in turns... but that longer suspension travel and higher setting works quite well on everyday California roads, with cracks and high curbs, which it absorbs well. The lower Viggen offsets this advantage, I would assume.

The interior is very nice. I have had many cars, but these seats are the best I've ever been in. Then again, ergonomy is a very personal thing, so it might just be luck. But there is no arguing with the leather quality. The instrument panel layout is great - very logical, big buttons, and they click with authority when you push them. The radio with integrated CD is very good once you figure out how to get rid of the cheap boombox "loudness" setting that comes as a standard setting. Change it, quick! Radio reception is excellent, many top end stereos in cars these days (my Jag XJR being the perfect example) pay no attention to radio reception it seems. Channels that sound terrible in the Jag's audiophile system sound crystal clear in the Saab.

Overall the car feels solid. Convertibles will always be less rigid than other cars, but I also test rode the Volvo C70, and that one *really* flexed, as, honestly, did the Beemer, if a little less so. The Merc CLK320 conv is the car that feels most like a brick, if that's what you truly value. The Saab feels plenty solid to me, though, and with the top up -other than visibility- feels just like a semi-luxo-cruiser. It'll have more internal noises than other comparable cars - listen to it during the test drive if you think you're allergic to any type of interior noise. But at least the Saab is honest about it from the get-go, while other convertibles will add more and more interior noise with time and miles - I talk from experience.

On the handling front: it handles well, you can really push it (this is with the sports option): I took it to a mountain road that I know well from riding my motorcyle there (see my BMW R1100S review :), and the car really goes. With the auto in sports mode, progress was very impressive, the car sticking like glue and *extremely* benevolently warning when you get into a tightening turn too hot. To me, a neglected aspect of real world handling is how a car reacts to brake application during a fast turn. Good track drivers will go "never do that!", and it is bad form, but on the road it is inevitable, be it due to obstacles or due to one misjudging turns on roads they're not as familiar with. The Saab is excellent at that, it is a darling. And you can go *fast*, faster than you'll have stomach for on real road. I had a lot of fun, and came away with a new found respect for the real world competence of this car. I didn't buy it for its performance, really, but simply because... I liked the fact you don't see many, I like the fact it is not a Beemer (wonderful car as it is, you just see too damn many, and the dealers turn you off with their complacency), I liked the brawny engine (and I owned silky V8 before this), and I liked its seeming laid-back cruiser attitude. I have the motorcycle for performance. But, as I mentioned, the Saab's formula strikes a balance that is simply fabulous for California roads, I think. It is not a canyon carver, its body rolls too much for that... but you can drive around that 8/10ths pace -which most people don't even remotely get to- all day long in a very relaxed manner. It's suspension is well-tuned for real world and offers a nice blend between many mutually exclusive requirements. 

It definitely is a car that you either like or dislike - the smooth streamlined choice it is not, and does not pretend to be. Its quirks might lead you to love it or dismiss it. Personally, I have fallen for its charm, and truly enjoy it to the fullest. After owning Jags for several years, for some reason the Saab choice feels like a wonderful decision to me. I hope they keep this tradition going.

You might miss the usual Saabness remarks on ignition key positioning... I might found it different at first, but really, it doesn't matter - it becomes utterly immaterial after a week, and all that matters is how the car works in real world terms. Just had to say that.

This all refers to a 2002 9-3 SE Convertible with sports package, heated seats and auto options.
