                 I bought my 1999 Chevy Tahoe in August of 2001 and I have yet to be disappointed with it's performance. I had never been a big fan of SUV's until August of last year when my girlfriend Heidi and I decided to look at used vehicles. As soon as we stepped out of our car Heidi spotted the Tahoe and begged me to let her take it for a test drive. I didn't want to at first because I wanted a "real truck" and not an SUV. However, I finally agreed to test drive it and I liked it so much that we bought it right then without a second thought.

     The first thing that impressed me about the Tahoe is how much space it has inside. The rear compartment alone is big enough for everyday use but, when you need more space just fold down the back seat and the storage space doubles in size. As an example, I went to Home Depot recently and loaded the Tahoe to the gills in home improvement supplies. With the back seat folded down I managed to put 2 sheets of sheetrock, 4 8ft long baseboards, 4 8ft long crown moldings, 3 40lb bags of potting soil, 3 gallons of paint, several miscellaneous tools and many potted plants. After all that I still had plenty of room to put groceries in there on the way back home. I also used it to transport items such as chests and small tables and other small furniture when I moved.  The front seats also have plenty of leg room so you can stretch out and relax.

     The Tahoe drives like a dream. I can't get over how smooth the ride is. The ride is just as smooth at 75 mph as it is at 45mph. It doesn't shake or rattle at high speeds like other cars I have owned. The second thing that impressed me about Tahoe is the short turn radius which has gotten me out of a few tight situations. It turns on a dime with ease and is easy to control. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the steering is too loose. Sometimes it feels like there is too much play in the steering wheel. However, after I got used to it I don't even notice it anymore. 

     The Tahoe sits higher than 80 percent of the vehicles on the road and that makes me feel comfortable. I don't want to be sitting down low if I were to be in a wreck. I want to be up high so as to sustain as little bodily injury as possible in a wreck.

     Everything in my Tahoe is under power. The power seats alone make the Tahoe the most comfortable vehicle I have owned. I can move the seats forward and backward and up and down. Both seats do that!!! I control both windows and both door locks from the driver side. Talk about convenience.

     I can tell you right now that the Tahoe has got some power! Heidi and I moved from California to Florida and we had to bring our Toyota Celica with us. We decided to tow it behind the Tahoe on a tow dolly. I thought we would have trouble towing through the Rocky mountains but we just put it into a lower gear and got through ok. Just for fun I used the 4x4 option and found out that it works very well. If you want a good family vehicle you can also use on the weekends for some off road action then the Tahoe is the vehicle for you.

     Now for the miscellaneous items. In the rear storage area by the back window there is a button that will lock and unlock all the doors without having to use a key. It's not really a neccesity but it's convenient. There are rear air vents on the floor directly behind both front seats. Your passengers in the back might thank you for that in extreme climates. The rearview mirror has a digital compass/thermometer which I don't need but it's cool to look at once in awhile. I also have leather throughout and that makes for a more comfortable ride. There is extra storage in both doors that can hold quite a bit of paper or about 8 cd's in cases.
