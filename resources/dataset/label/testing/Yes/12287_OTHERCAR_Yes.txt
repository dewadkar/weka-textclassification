            <i>(Note: The title is the song that they play for the Eclipse commercials on TV.)</i>

My friend bought a year 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS in March and I have driven it dozens of times and ride in it almost every day.  This is one of the best cars we have ever had. 

<b>Looks: 10</b>

There's no doubt about it, this car has a very nice look to it.  The outside design is sleek, and original.  Not only does it not look like any other car on the road, but there are very few other Eclipses on the road right now, so it's easy to spot your own.  

The inside of the car is also very stylish.  When you climb into the car, it is like getting into a cockpit with lots of gadgets and controls around you.  One of my favorite features is that the clock is almost on top of the dash, so you don't have to look down to see it while driving.  

<b>Comfort: 7</b>

This car would be comfortable if it was just for 1 to 2 young people.  The front seat is plenty roomy, and the seats are very comfortable.  The driver's side seat can even be raised and lowered, for extra tall people.  There is hardly any room in the back seat for passengers, however.  The other problem is getting out of the car.  Since it is a sports car it is low to the ground - this makes it difficult to get out of. 

The car also takes bumps well.  You might think that since it is a sports car, and so low to the ground it wouldn't, but the Eclipse does.  This car would be fine for a long trip, as long as you aren't bringing more than 2 people.

<b>Heat / AC: 9</b>

The heat and AC in this car work great.  The vents are the new round kind.  When you shut these vents nothing will come out, unlike the old kind that you slid them shut, cold / warm air still escaped.  The other great thing about the air system in the Eclipse is that you can just leave it on blower and it will just blow the outside air in.  This is great on a rainy day when you don't want to leave your windows open.  My only complaint is that if you leave the vents open without the air or heat on warmish air blows in.

<b>Sound System: 8</b>

This car comes with a great standard sound system.  The GS model has six speakers.  Two in the back, two on the bottom of the door in the front seat, and two small ones on the door near the mirrors.  The sound from CD's is great.  

Instead of having a normal antenna the Eclipse comes with one that is mounted to the rear window.  It looks like it is part of the defogger.  Because of that system I don't think the radio stations come in as well.  This antenna is nice because it doesn't get stuck in car washes, or look ugly. 

<b>Speed / Handling: 10</b>

The GS is only a V4, but it has 154 horsepower.  The car will accelerate rapidly, and go much faster than you would ever need to go on a US freeway.  It also will coast at the same speed for much longer than most cars.  It is definitely not a fight to make this car speed.  Anyone who complains that this car is not fast or powerful enough is just looking for a testosterone boost.  The car also handles very well.  You hardly need to slow down to turn or take an exit off the highway.

<b>Gas Mileage: 10</b>  

This car is excellent on gas.  It has a 16.4-gallon tank, and can get upwards of 30+ miles to the gallon.  I would definitely consider it fuel-efficient.

<b>Other Features:</b>

The Eclipse also has other nifty features that I have not talked about.  In addition to it's power windows and locks, it has a power sun roof.  With one button push you can make it flip open about an inch, roll all the way back, or just part way back.  

If you purchase an automatic GS it will come with a Sportronic shifter.  This means that you can drive it like a normal automatic car, or you can use the shifter to shift gears like a manual car - except there is no clutch.

I also enjoy the amount of trunk space this tiny car has.  The back seat can easily fold down, and the trunk is actually a hatchback.  As a result there is something like 16 cubic feet of trunk space.
