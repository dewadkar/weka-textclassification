            I sampled many vehicles before settling on a 2001 LE. This car has more zip than I expected and is Alan Greenspan at the pump. Expect to pony up plenty of extra duckets to get the features you like such as keyless entry, power windows and door locks, decent looking wheels and a CD player (which I declined). However, when compared to a comparably equipped Honda Civic, the Corolla was about $1,000 cheaper, a deal-maker for me.

The LE's interior, although a bit cramped, is well thought out. All important power buttons are appropriately placed and the radio controls are easily within reach. On the lower left side of the driver's seat are the remote release buttons for the trunk and gas tank. While the trunk should not be mistaken for the grand canyon, it's capable of holding several bags of groceries or two larges suitcases and a small carry-on bag or two which is not bad for a car in this class.

The exterior will probably not set your soul ablaze but, then again, Toyota is not known for being a risk taker in the styling category. The Corolla takes many of it's styling cues from its bigger sibling, the Camry, with it's more-than-slightly angled fenders. This is not to say that the Corolla is an unattractive car. I've received my share of attention while driving it and it is a looker when compared to compact sedans like the Chevy Cavalier, Mitsubishi Mirage or any Kia sedan. However, car makers such as Nissan, Mazda and even Hyundai have given their compact sedans' exterior styling much more attention in recent years than Toyota.
