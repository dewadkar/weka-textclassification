            Boy, I love taking pictures with my camera. I take pictures of everything and with this camera I can choose which pictures I want to keep or get rid of after. So, I take pictures of sunsets, beaches, long walks on the beach, the sea, seagull, the waves. I love taking pictures and it is so much easier to take pictures using this camera. It is alot of fun to use this camera and it takes great pictures it is pretty easy to print the pictures too. If I had a chose of a digital or normal camera I would for sure choose the digital it is just so much better and more fun.<br><br>
