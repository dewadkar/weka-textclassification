            That front is roomy but the drivers seat could go back further. My leg and foot gets crapped after about 45min.'s of driving. Needs cruise control but that is a $580 CAN. touch. Needs more power, any little up hill grade and it shifts down. The A/C works great but take WAY to much power. Heater also uses a lot of power. The paint on the grill keeps chipping every time I was the bugs off. I have replaced the grill twice and still the same problem. I have only had the car a month and only 2,800km on the car. I would also like to see the car come with 15 inch wheels.
The sound system in the car is Great. It came with a SONY Explode Tape deck. I would like a CD player but that was $250CAN. extra. I can buy a New CD Deck of my choice for that price.
