            I've had this camera for nearly a month now and been quite pleased with its performance. With the flash on, the pictures come out perfectly, but sometimes they are a bit washed in daylight settings. Turning off the flash poses a problem: the pictures turn out blurry without use of a tripod to steady the camera.

Overall quality of the pictures is good and there are a variety of settings to increase or decrease the quality, which dramatically changes the amount of pictures that one can store on a memory card. I would recommend getting a bigger sd memory card than the 16mb included, since it only holds about 20 pictures at 1280x960 at fine quality. A 128mb card (holds 140  pics) costs only 28-30 pounds.

Despite the camera's extremely compact size, it still has room for loads of features. The viewfinder is plenty big enough to see the writing on the menus and to preview the pictures that one has recently taken. There is even a zoom and scroll features to see the entire picture and view it close up, without it even going blurry. 

The camera has a 12x zoom without any moving parts, although I found that I have only found it useful to the 4x optical zoom before the digital zoom kicked it, due to stability issues. 

There is also a great "remote camera" feature that makes this camera unique. It allows the camera to function as a webcam that surpasses the quality and smoothness of video compared to other webcams. I've used it with MSN messenger and I know it also works with netmeeting. This feature alone has made this camera worth the investment.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants big quality for little cash.
