            I bought a 99 Isuzu Rodeo LS back in March and have been driving it since.  I have had a chance to use the 4WD on snowy roads up in Tahoe and it performed exceptionally well.  However, I use it mostly for city driving.  If you are looking for a rugged SUV that can handle a little off-road and carry a lot of gear, this is the choice.  I drive a 5 speed manual, which was difficult to find.  You can get a Rodeo LS with a lot of options for much less than it's competitors such as the Grand Cherokee, Toyota 4Runner, Ford Explorer, etc).  It also has a lot more horsepower than it's competition (great pick up!).  FYI, the back window opens upward on a hinge and the tailgate swings out to the left and locks (not down)

 If you are looking for a smooth riding luxury SUV, do not buy this vehicle.  If you are a weekend warrior, looking for a rugged, spacious, powerful SUV, it's the best deal out there.<br>
