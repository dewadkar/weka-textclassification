            I bought a 2000 Honda Prelude a few months ago and so far I love this car.  It has been a great purchase for me.  I've never bought a new car before and I wanted to buy something that was practical yet also something that wasn't boring.  The Honda fit the bill.

I'll update this review as I have more experience with the car but so far here are some notes:

1.  The car is so smooth.  I've never driven a car that had such a smooth sounding engine.  I was first concerned about the engine noise at high RPMs but I don't notice it and if I do, I like it.  The engine has a great sound and you'll enjoy taking to the max.

2.  Handles perfectly.  It's great in the curves.

3.  It's got good speed but not great speed.  This is not a car that's going to win at the drag races but it's got some power at the low end and the high end.

4.  It's small.  For me this is a good point but if you need people to sit in the backseat you may not like this car.

5.  It's heavy.  It doesn't feel heavy on the road but this car weighs 3000 pounds and you can tell you aren't driving a tin machine.  If the car weighed less, it would be faster (like the Acura Integra Type R).

6.  The stock CD player is below par.  I've started replacing my stereo system already.  This is disappointing considering the price of the car.
