            I bought my new 04 Special Edition Jeep Grand Cherokee only about 2 weeks ago and have only 1000 miles on it. So far, everything is great and I look forward to driving it every day. The Special Edition offers a nicer trim package with color side moldings (no plastic on the outside), a better stereo, fog lights, and an upper console information system (gas mileage, temperature, compass, etc). I live in Atlanta so I opted for the six cylinder engine with two wheel drive. I'm no speed demon and I don't intend on getting my new Jeep dirty by going off road. I love the way the Cherokee handles on the roads, it's tight and very responsive. The engine is very quiet along with the overall ride of the Jeep. I was very impressed by the low wind noise I was expecting to get on my first test drive. All the controls are at easy reach and easy to read and operate. I like the delay feature on the rear window wiper, my last SUV only had on and off. The stereo has an amazing sound that fills up the cabin with extreme clarity, it makes my drive time more enjoyable. The Cherokee has plenty of storage compartments to offer and I especially like that they put the full size spare tire on the inside of the vehicle so in case of a flat, you're not outside trying to down reel a dirty tire from underneath. Both the rear hatch and glass open separately which can be a blessing when hauling larger items. One thing I don't care for is the way you have to pull up the back seat in order to fold down the back rest so it lays flat. You have to take the headrests off, find a place to put them for a moment, pull up the seat cushion, pull down the back rest, and then place the headrests in their small slots to be stored. Jeep could have taken a lesson from some of the other domestic engineers and figured a way to pull one lever and have everything move forward and lay flat in one motion. The only other complaint I have is where the window and door lock controls are placed on the door panels. I felt it would be easier if they could place them further toward the dash so it would be easier to operate. Other than the two complaints I have listed above, I can't find anything I don't like about my new Jeep. The gas mileage was a bit better then what I expected so I really don't have any complaints in that area. This is an SUV so if gas consumption is an issue for you, don't buy any SUV. Like I said, I am very impressed with the mileage I am receiving so far. As you can tell by now, I am no serious review writer but I can tell you that I am very happy with my new Jeep, I hope to get many years of enjoyment out of it.
