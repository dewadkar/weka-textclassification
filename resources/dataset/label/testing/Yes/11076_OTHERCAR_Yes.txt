            When you see this car it reminds you of a sculpture carved out of stone with its eloquent design and perfection. The TT just looks too perfect to drive and at a affordable price of 30K it is comparable to the new 3 series BMW. Although they both look impressive I especially like the TT. Not only does it look better it is also faster with a 180 hp going from 0-60 mph in about 7.4 seconds. I admire the design of the TT with the distinct round shapes of the car. Even in the interior there is the presence of the round features. The holes for the AC unit fans are also round along with the shift nob. The shifting is great with short throws and the nob has an excellent round chrome design. The car has been detailed from the interior and exterior to perfection. If this car is to be purchased I would suggest the quattro (4 wheel drive) and the optional sports package (17&quot; rims). This car handles great and sounds great and can seat four. Although the additional two seating at the back is slightly cramped. The leather in the car is really soft and comfortable and just sitting in the car feels like you can go fast. The TT feels great around the turns with its lightweight of 2655 lbs. The radio display is especially nice with a shiny plate covering it with the TT logo. I am currently awaiting the new model due out in next spring with 240 hp. <br><br>
