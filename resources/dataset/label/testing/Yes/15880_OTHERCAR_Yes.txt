            My Chrysler Cirrus has been pretty good to me.  It is reliable, gets pretty good gas mileage on the freeway, and has a lot of room for all the groceries my kids eat.

I think that this is an ideal commute car since it has good gas mileage on the freeway(I usually get in the low 30's on long freeway trips).  It isn't too big so it isn't a problem to park.  My only real complaint is that it isn't the easiest car to see out of.  The rear-view mirror blocks my vision sometimes and if the sun visor is down it leaves about six inches of space to see out the windshield.  

If you go on a lot of long trips with multliple people this may not be the car for you.  My kids are always complaining about not being comfortable in the backseat and if there is other stuff such as food coolers it is really cramped.  <br><br>
