            In January 1999, I leased a red Honda Prelude for 24 months.  I have the distinct honor of taking delivery of the 1st Prelude from this dealership.  The car cost $25,000.

The test drive showed that this was not like Preludes of past generations.  This generation had a serious sporting intent to it.  I would have overlooked it except a dealer friend suggested that I consider it.

I selected this car because of the way it drove. It was the most exciting of the ones I had considered, which included (all 97's)- Integra GS-R, A4 Quattro 2.8, Legacy GT 2.5, Acura CL 3.0.

I was very surprised at how good the handling was - another reason why I chose it. No torque steer, quick though a little notchy shift. Little play in the steering or the shifter.  Very neutral, unlike many front wheel drive cars.

For the first 1000 miles, I did not push the car too hard.  The car was already fun to drive.  After the 1000 miles, I decided to push it to the red line to see what it would do.  When I hit 5300 RPM with my foot on the floor in 2nd, I was in for a surprise.  A growl started and the push in my back became stronger.  I had discovered the VTEC!!!  Now I had a permanent smile on my face.

Any time I was having a bad day, all I had to do was drop the car into second, hit 5300 RPM and my blues went away.  I was ready to face the world again.  The car sounded and felt so good that the brief spurt to the red line in 2nd was enough to cheer me up, no need for extended speeding.

The ride is very good, not too firm nor harsh. I suspect choice of tires here will make a big difference. I over inflated the tires a little too. Very little body roll in turns.

Nice bucket seats. Keep you in place while taking tight turns. I don't remember if leather was an option, but I wanted to wear shorts in summer, so cloth was fine.  Very simple but clean interior.

I tried autocrossing the car and quickly found out that the power steering is inadequate.  Even with enough power steering fluid, if you attempt either a slalom or any kind of sudden left/right maneuver like evasive action to avoid another vehicle, the power steering will cut out on you without warning.  It will recover once you stop the maneuver.  Honda had no answer when I asked the dealer.

The down side to this vehicle is that for about the same money, you can get an Accord with a V6 :(

Another down side is with such a sweet engine, even if you red line in 1st with the VTEC going, shifting into second takes you OUT of the VTEC power band and you have to wind it back up again.  Nonetheless, still a lot of fun.

The car provided 24 months of absolutely trouble free driving.  Regular oil changes were my only visits to the dealership.  If you are looking for a good looking vehicle with little or no maintenance requirements and goes, this is a very good choice.

It was a tough choice giving up the lease, but I ended up moving into a Boxster, so I have no regrets.<br><br>
