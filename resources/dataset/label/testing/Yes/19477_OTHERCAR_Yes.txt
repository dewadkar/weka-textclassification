            I traded a Kia Sportage for a Passport.  I really like to drive and ride in the Passport.  My Passport has everything except the roof rack.  It is reasonably comfortable and does the job well.  I have used it to tow a trailer weighing in excess of 2000 pounds.  There were absolutely no difficulties noted.  At times, you forgot there was a trailer there.  The cargo room is wonderful.  Both the driver and all the passengers are very comfortable.  The seats completely fold away to allow an area, where in a pinch, a couple of people can crash.  It is built solid and handles wonderfully.  If I could improve it, I would make it a bit more economical at the pumps.  Mine normally gets around 18.6 miles per gallon, but I live in mountainous terrain.  I highly recommend this vehicle.  Nothing rattles or shakes.<br><br>
