            The Silver Bmw 328i sedan I have is quite a well built car. Its the overall feel and look of the car that makes it so good.The Bmw symbol creates jealous drivers. The handling is smooth. This automobile makes you feel like a million bucks. Wow I do have to admit that this car is pretty special.I wouldn't miss an opportunity to experience driving this car for the world.Alas I am planning on taking it back to my dealer.It's great but its not for everyone. The insurance will kill ya. I'm a sports car guy anyways. I love the bmw but I am gonna stay faithful to my mustang. <br><br>
