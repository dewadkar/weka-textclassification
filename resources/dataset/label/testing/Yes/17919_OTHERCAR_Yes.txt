            This car rocks! I owned a 1994 Subaru SVX LSi. It had everything from leather to CD to Sunroof to those fun windows! You can't beat Subaru's all wheel drive system. This car is sporty but was fantastic in the snow. The 230 horse power, V6 was like a jet in traffic. The gas mileage was around 18 MPG and 93 grade gas was needed. My insurance was considered the same as a sports sedan - according to Allstate at the time, that made me happy. I just adored this car.

Now, my mechanic will tell you he wasn't so thrilled about the car. It had some problems as many of the SVX vehicles have had. Tires were expensive as they were not standard tires. The temperature readout dial blew and had to be replaced - which meant removal of the dash and an expensive part from Subaru. My paint bubbled on the passenger side of the car down near the ground. The Air Bag light was a problem and to fix the malfunction was going to be quite costly. Parts became more difficult to come by and big bucks. I decided to sell.

But I miss this car so much. It was my dream car, still is. I am very sad Subaru decided not to continue this model - but then again it wasn't every day I saw another either. I really liked that. I now drive a Subaru Wagon...lots more of them around and not as much fun and power as my little green all wheel drive SVX. <br><br>
