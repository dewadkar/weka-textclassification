            In 99 I was in the market for a family car. I was pregnant and due in June. I was always a sports car driver so driving a family car was new to me. So I was looking for a car that had a sportier look, but that had enough room for my babies car seat and a large trunk for the stroller and whatever else I would have to lug around.
I shopped around and never even thought to look at mitsubishi, they have never had a car I would have ever looked at before. A friend of mine mentioned that the Galant was number one in &quot;Car and Driver&quot; and number in &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; so I figured why not check it out. When I saw the silver 99 I knew I had to have it. I have had the car for almost a year and I love it. Being that I am going to be having another child in the next year or two I will have to get a bigger car but until then I will continue to enjoy my car.
Wish it was the size of the montero so I could get another one.
