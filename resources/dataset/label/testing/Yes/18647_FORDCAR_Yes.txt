            When I went shopping for my first SUV I wanted something attractive, not too expensive, and that roomy enough for my needs.  Well, here's what I've experienced after owning my SUV for the past 5 years (I bought my /97 Explorer in Oct. 1996).

Pros:
Space - I really like the roomy interior.  I was kind of afraid of not being able to put my windsurf board inside the vehicle, but it fit with a couple of inches to spare.  My tall friends were able to sit comfortably w/o hitting their heads on the ceiling while going over a speed bump.

Price - The price was fine at the time, but I'll tell you more in the Cons section.  

Comfort - I have the leather package so it's been really nice to have soft seats to sit on.  Plus, they don't get as hot during the summer as I thought they would.

Tires - Thank goodness I didn't get Firestone tires when I bought my SUV.  It came with GoodYear tires.

Cons:
Fuel economy - Of course, many SUV's are gas guzzlers, and this is no exception.  For me to drive 16 miles to/from work I have to fill up about every other week.  Considering I don't drive much during the weekends.

Parts - This goes along w/ price.  Before the warranty was up the chair recliner handle broke off.  I'm not very tall (only 5'4") and I pretty much have to slide out to get down.  Well, when I do the cover where the chair controls are keeps bending outwards and I kept hitting the handle.  The handle kept bending outwards also and I'm having to bend it back into place.  Of course, everybody knows what happens when you bend metal back/forth.  It eventually weakens and breaks.  It got fixed under warranty the first time, but it broke again and this time outside of the warranty.

Mirrors - My side mirror (driver side) doesn't work anymore because the electrical system, I guess, shorted out.  So, I have to adjust the mirror manually.
  
Audio system - Once in a while it'll glitch out.  It looks as though it gets these electrical surges.  Don't ask.

Brakes - I don't know what it is about my brakes, but they keep making this creaking sound when I stop.  I tried getting them fixed a couple of times, but it didn't help.

Height - It's not what you think.  I'm not talking about VEHICLE height.  This vehicle wasn't really made for short people in mind.  To reach the brake/gas pedals I have to adjust my chair all the way forward & up.  When I do this my knees pretty much kiss the lower-part of the dashboard.  Too scary for me.  So I have to deal w/ it by scunching back a tad and stretching for the pedals.

The only reason why I said that I would recomment this to a friend is because I really loved the vehicle the first few years I've had it.  Now that the warranty is up, I'm running into problems here/there.
