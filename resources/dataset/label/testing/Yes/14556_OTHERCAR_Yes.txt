            I purchased my 1992 Corrado SLC after having owned (and driven into the ground) an original Beetle, an original sirocco, and a wonderful 1984 GTI.  When the GTI hit 100,000 miles, it wouldn't stay in alignment any more, and I thought I would test drive the then-new 1991 supercharged Corrado.  What a dog!  Whiney and slow, with crummy sightlines, it was overpriced and presumptuous.  VW was in steep decline at that point, and they had a loser in that G60 Corrado for sure. Stopping at a VW dealership to answer a page (really!), I asked about test driving a '92 GTI, and the salesman threw me the keys for the SLC Corrado instead.  Not realizing that 2 additional cylinders had been added under the hood, I took it out for a test.  What an experience!  Better than the Bimmers I had tried, much more nimble than the Mitsubishi 2000, and far less oversteer than the Porsche 944.  Acceleration as though the pedal was attached to a rheostat attached to the power company.  I bought the car on the spot.131,000 miles later, I'm just as enthusiastic.  It's still faster than it has any right to be, and total strangers still come up to me to ask if I want to sell it.  The seats are extremely comfortable, and their highly bolstered sides come very handy when cornering produces high lateral forces.  It still has no speed-limiting chip (these were added the next year), and it still starts and runs like a top.Have I had trouble with it?  You bet.  Had to replace the brakes for the first time at 91,000 miles.  Might have to replace the exhaust system and mufflers some day.  Two recalls have replaced the heater core (I never had any trouble with it)and added an additional heat sensor.At 125,000 miles, I had the clutch replaced when the mechanics had to go into the engine after tensioners for the timing chain failed.  At that time, not wanting to spend the money for another head removal, I asked them to replace the head gasket, and they advised that I replace the secondary water pump, the primary water pump, and the oil inter-cooler.$3,000 in repairs total over my first 130,000 miles.Despite loving this car, I do have some gripes.  It is VERY expensive to work on with parts closer in price to Porsches than VW's, and the tires may only last 30,000 miles but at least they cost $150 a piece (Z-rated).  There are relatively huge blind spots at each &quot;B-panel,&quot; and the &quot;ground effects&quot; plastic under the front bumper break off in the snow.  Finally, the gearing places 1st and 2nd too low for this high torque engine.  However, if you want a car that is a major kick to drive and has the definite aura of a limited-production vehicle, this is one to look at.<br><br>
