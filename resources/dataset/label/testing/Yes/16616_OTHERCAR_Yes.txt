            I bought a 1999 Catera Sport in October of 1999.  The Sport model had been recently introduced and shared a lot of the upgrades that were made for the upcoming 2000 model.  I knew the car had a questionable history but I decided to give the car a chance since I really liked the feel and quality of the test drive.  The Sport model does have a stiffer ride than the regular and has contoured leather seats that hold you firmly in place.

I now have 16,000 miles on the car and have had one repair-an oil line.  My dealer took care of this promptly.  Since then, I like the car more and more everyday.  It has a sports car ride and feel.  It does not rattle or hum at any speed and it corners beautifully.  

Yes it could use a bit more power to start from zero.  The car is heavy for its size and is a bit sluggish but at cruising speeds I find no problem with its power and performance.  The Catera has the worst cup holders-I would almost prefer to have none since I am always tempted to use them and then I am sorry I did.  They are very much in the way while driving.  My final negative is the size of the trunk.  It will not hold a set of golf clubs except when placed diagonally-which leaves little room for anything else.  All Cadillac's should easily hold 2 sets of golf clubs.

To close on a positive, I am very pleased with my decision to buy this car and have enjoyed it for 15 months now.  I am looking forward to several more years with this car.
