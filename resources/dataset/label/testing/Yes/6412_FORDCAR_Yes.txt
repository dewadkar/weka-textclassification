<TEXT>
            I purchased a 1990 Ford Aerostar with over 100,000 miles on it and I love it...I have 3 kids with one on the way PLUS my fiance and his daughter...Needless to say we need all the room we can get and with this Mini Van you get all kinds of room with some to spare...The removable seats are GREAT...As far as driving it, it has a large OPEN windshield that provides a great unobstructed view, the seats are very comfortable and the middle and back seat lay back to make a bed...If you have a family of 5 or more this is THE vehicle for you...Yes it will have to be used BUT it is worth it...mine now has over 140,000 miles on it and I am still loving it and having no problems! <br><br>
