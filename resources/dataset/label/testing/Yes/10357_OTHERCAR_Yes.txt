            I began my search for a new car two months ago.  I recently was promoted and my job requires much traveling and high powered meetings.  Up until last month I drove a Plymouth Colt.  My baby since Junior year of college.  She still drove fairly well, but with no power steering and little room for luggage it left something to be desired.  I also needed a car that looked a little more polished than my '92 Colt.  So that is how my search began.

I narrowed down the field of cars to the Civic and Corolla, because of cost and reliability.  I test drove my 2001 Silverstream Opal Corolla and fell in love.  Sure it wasn't love at first sight.  It didn't have many frills, but it did come with a cassette player and cup holders.  (A must for any coffee lover!)  And it drove like a dream.  Silently and smooth.  I drove home my corolla two days after the test drive.  And I couldn't be happier!

This car is a great value for any young family or recent college grad.  My parents, who are empty nesters, also own a Corolla.  All in all, the Corolla is a lot of quality car, for little money.<br><br>
