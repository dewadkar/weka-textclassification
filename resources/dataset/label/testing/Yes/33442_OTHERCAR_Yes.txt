            I bought the 2000 Jetta , 4 cylinder engine because the dealer could not give me a V6. With the V4 if I may call it that it pretty cool but the only problem I have with the car is it's slow acceleration .The base price of the car is a little above $17000 but other packages shoots the price up . I took the luxury package and leather upholstery which shot up the price to about $22,150.You get remote entry key as a standard option and it has  got a nice feature that opens the trunk after pressing the trunk key for sometime . The car handles well I drove from Indy to St. Paul and had no problem . The car is very comfortable and I wasn't fatigued at all .
I got rear ended when coming back and my car is still in the body shop , The Volkswagen is not able to supply the rear bumper for a week and that sucks.<br><br>
