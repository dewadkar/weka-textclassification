            We've had our Durango for a little over a year now.  We did extensive research in the SUV field.  We compared the Chevy Tahoe, (too big) the Ford Explorer, (too small) and the Ford Expedition.  For outright comparability in prices, the Durango was a much better buy than all of the aforementioned vehicles.  It also came with better options and a bigger engine than the other 3.  We have not had any problems with our Durango.  We have the 5.2 liter V-8 Magnum.  We get around 15 miles to the gallon for all-purpose driving.  Towing is a breeze, especially with the easy to operate overdrive button.  We have not found anything, a boat, or trailer that we can't haul comfortably and safely.  We bought the Durango for its versatility in cargo space and the third seat in the back.  The seats are theatre style seating so even the kids in the far back get a good look at where we are going.  Driving the Durango is like driving a luxury car.  With the &quot;S&quot; springs in the back; it makes cornering very easy and comfortable.  The ease of transforming the seats into more cargo space, or putting somebody in the third seat is just like they say in the commercials.  If you are looking for a vehicle that can do many things; towing, hauling groceries or the neighbor kids, climb the steepest hills without losing power, and drive in class and luxury, then the Durango is for you.<br><br>
