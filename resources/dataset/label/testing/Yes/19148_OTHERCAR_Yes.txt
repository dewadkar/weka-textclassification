            When for 10 grand less you can get a VW Passat that is almost the same.  My wife's car has better pick up than my old BMW 325i and almost comparable handling.

Interior:
Plenty of headroom for the front passengers and a comfortable ride for the rear.  This isn't the same cramped VW's that you remember driving in college.  VW obviously took a lot from the Audi division and put it this car (considering it's the same engine and chasis as the A4)

Ride:
It's a pretty smooth ride, although it is highly recommended to go for the V6.  We test drove the 4 cylinder and felt that the 6 was the better choice.  As expected, it has crisp handling like most other German cars.

reliability:
We've had this 99 for almost a year now and have had nothing that would warrant a visit to the dealer outside of the oil change.  There have been two recalls, but neither have affected us (unless you're in WI or MT where it gets really damn cold)

Overall:
It's a fun car to drive and one that I don't mind taking to the store because it is quick, responsive, and comfortable all in one.  It may be the most reasonably price/performance German car on the market.  (sob, since I drive a BMW 528)
