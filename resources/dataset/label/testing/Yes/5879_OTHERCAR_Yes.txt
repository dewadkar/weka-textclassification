            <b>Intro</b>

Right, a certain person has been calling me a slacker for not writing any recent reviews.  To be honest I have not had any strong E-Pinions on anything lately and the new voice activated Navigation/DVD system I had installed in my car last week is not in the product catalog, or I would be raving about it!

So, to keep my hand in I thought I would tell you about a recent car rental involving the new Mitsu Outlander.

I lived with a white AWD model for two days and all in all found the experience to be favorable.  

<b>Exterior:</b>

Love it or hate it, the styling is distinctive.  Personally I don't much care for the look of the snout on the beast, thats some beak the designers gave it.  But I can't say it doesn't stand out.  The roof bars are a bit of a mystery to me though.  They look great and when I picked it up I remember thinking they would come in handy for transporting my wifes surfboard.  Well when it came to it I picked up the board and was about to drop in on the bars....... only to stop at the last min when I realised there are no cross bars.  DOH!  So whats the point?  I even looked it up on Cars Direct and it's not an option.  Maybe the dealers have something?

This buggy has a decent ground clearance too, I realised this when I got out the first time and my foot went further than expected before hitting the parking lot, and yes I did check I wasn't putting my foot in a hole thanks.. :)  The down side of this is, I dusted the door sill off with my pant leg as it sticks out a little.  Something to consider, especially if you are on the shorter side.  I am 5' 8", oh and it's not high enough to add a step either.

<b>Interior</b>

Here's where I was really impressed.  The inside is finished very nicely, road noise was minimal even at (cough) a mile or so over the speed limit.  For the door inserts, they have used a suede like material, it's hard touch but feels nice and I found myself stroking it as I got out, wierd I know but it felt nice.  Across the dash is a silver fabric mesh material.  It felt hard wearing and gave the otherwise dark grey interior a lift.  Other silver plastic accents are tastefully done.

Seats felt very comfy to me, again i have a medium build, larger folks may find them a little snug.  The seats themselves are sporty with nice side bolsers that hold you in place during spirited driving.

Not too many gadgets here, the radio is simple to use, there are no wheel mounted controls though.  It came equipped with a CD player and the tunes coming out of it were pleasing enough with enough capacity for a deep thumping soundtrack without speaker distortion.  Cruise control and a variable intermittent wiper speed are nice features but thats about it for extra's.

The A/C blows cold very quickly and I have to say although initially I hated the vent controls, round plastic discs that you push to open and I though seemed cheap actually work very well and should be much easier to dust off than the regular style with slider knobs.  Simple and well thought out design here.

Moving to the back seat.  Since the surf board wouldn't go on the roof, it had to go inside.  There are three back seat headrests, yep one for the middle seat too.  I didn't spend any time in them but they felt comy enough.  With the headrests, this meant I couldn't just slide the board in without fear of putting it through the windshield on an emergency stop.  So I decided to put em down and came across another neat feature.  First up came removing the rear cargo cover.  It was the usual spring loaded end type design and came out easily enough to reveal four different holes on each side.  Huh?  Then on to the seats, a std 60/40 split, I pulled up the leaver on top to unlatch them and moved it one click.  Oh I get it....  both rear seats have different reclining positions, and you can adjust the cargo cover to suite.  These positions ranged from Doze off to bolt upright with several settings in between.  And yes, it swallows an 8ft Funboard, though the shape of the rear hatch does intrude on box swallowing capacity.

<b>Driving</b>

This is tricky, it feels underpowered, but it's really not that bad.  I found myself wishing for more umph, then glancing at the speedo and realised I was trying to accelerate from a freeway speed already exceeding our 65mph limit.  With my trusty 96' Isuzu Trooper, putting your foot down makes a lot of noise, you may not actually get anywhere quickly but it sounds like its trying.  The Mitsu on the otherhand just did a muted growl thing.  You sit pretty high, that along with great visability and a quiet cabin conspires you to feel like you are going slower than you really are.

Bottom line, it stepped out smartly enough and if you want to be a stoplight racer, then is a Mini SUV really for you?  That said a recent quick drive in a Ford Escape with the V6 did put the Mitsu to shame, but then the Mitsu wins hands down on the interior.

Handling is taught, though pushing it does reveal a slight wallow.  Still, it's plenty supple on the freeway without being harsh, so again if you want sports car handling, go get a sports car.  

Autostick, you can control the gear changes by moving the shifter over and nudging it up and down to change gears.  Personally I have yet to really understand the need for this kind of thing.  I tried rowing my own but it lead to jerky downshifts and I couldn't get my brain wired to shift gear without using my left foot.  I can tell you it won't shift up on you at red line though, but will bounce off the rev limiter.  Oops....  The only occasional use I had for it was to drop into third ready for an overtake manover, but then if you plan the kickdown, it's just as easy to do in Drive mode.

I can't make much comment on the gas milage, I wasn't paying attention as I didn't plan to write any reviews. ;)

Likes:

Interior - Like a Lot
Rear Seat Positioning
Front Seat comfort
Sporty Handling

Dislikes:

The Nose
Fiddly electric mirror control tucked away under the dash
Useless roof bars (would move to likes if they provided the cross bars)


<b>The Bottom Line</b>
Since my wife has been bitten by the surfing bug, she has expressed an interest in trading her sedan in for a mini suv.  The Ford Escape & Mazda Tribute is on the shot list, along with the Land Rover Freelander.  This Mitsu is going on there too.  Ultimately at just a hair under $20k (Cars Direct) I think there are other options, however with Mitsubishi's creative financing such as 0,0,0, it may be a winner
