            In April of 1999, I bought a 1998 Periwinkle blue Lumina from one of our Local Car Dealerships. I was &quot;forced&quot; to purchase a new car, because the car I was driving was falling apart before my very eyes. It was a tough fight, but my car lost. It was time to trade it in. 

The funny thing, I did NOT like this car when I first saw it. It was too &quot;family car-ish&quot; for me. I was use to driving my Sports Car, so I wanted something that appeared to be more sporty. So we walked on by it. Plus, I thought the color was weird!

So we kept looking. Eventually, we walked by the car again. It was growing on me! So I decided to test drive it. I LOVED it! It drove/drives like a champ, and it had all the &quot;features&quot; that I required. (Auto locks, windows, etc). It is very roomy in the front and back seat (I'm almost 6 foot tall, and I am very comfortable). My son's favorite feature is the cool slide-out cup holder  near the front seat. The only thing I don't like, is there are no cup holders in the back seat.

We have had NO maintenance problems with this car. We just keep the oil changed. 

Driving this car is a very easy experience. I am a nervous driver, but I felt totally at ease. It drives very smooth in my opinion. Plus, it has the &quot;Sporty Mommy&quot; look! :)

I think this car is definitely for anyone looking for a reliable car for a decent price.<br><br>
