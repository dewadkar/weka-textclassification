            I bought a 850 Turbo wagon in 1998 with only 72,000kms (about 45,000 miles).  I was impressed by its performance, handling and reputation for safety.

Almost immediately, the car started to lighten my wallet.  In less than one year:

1) right front brake caliper seized 
2) O2 sensor failed
3) A/C evaporator failed
4) retainer clips for tailgate cover broke or fell off

The brakes and O2 sensor cost about $300 each but the evaporator was quoted at $1,400.00.  Ouch.  I passed on the repair and will likely do it this spring.  I've subsequently found quite a few 850 owners with the same problem.  As for the tailgate cover, I tried replacing the clips but they keep coming off.  Very poor design.  I'm now resigned to the fact that the cover will be loose and rattling for as long as I own the car.

From a driveability and comfort standpoint, I could not be happier.  It's one of the fastest cars I've owned.  A beautiful highway cruiser.  Very little turbo lag and a light but firm steering feel make it great in the city too.

The ride is slightly rough, especially by North American landyacht standards, but that has a lot to do with the very low profile tires.  Other owners report that switching the tires and wheels for something with a thicker sidewall offers a smoother ride.  However, I do not mind the ride at all.  You just have to remember to hang onto your dentures when you go over railroad tracks.

I also give high marks for ergonomics.  The front seats are without a doubt the most comfortable car seats I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  All the controls are intuitive and easy to reach.

I highly recommend this car but, my advice is to have the A/C system professionally checked for leaks before you buy.  Do not rely on a &quot;by-feel&quot; check of the A/C to see if it blows cold.  The leaks in the evaporator are minute and the coolant leaks are very gradual.  The owner may not even know there is a problem.  You must get a professional A/C technician to check it out. 

Finally, be careful of radar traps.  You'll just be itching to stomp the gas pedal with this car.  Just sit back and be assured that you've got the fastest family hauler in the neighbourhood.<br><br>
