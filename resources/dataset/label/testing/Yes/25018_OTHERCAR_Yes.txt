            After my old Subaru hit 300,000 miles, it was time to get a new vehicle.  I ran across a great deal on a Plymouth van.  I had never had a mini van before, so I decided to give it a try.

I golf and travel a lot, so the room it had in the back was great.  Thd kids love it too, they all want to ride in &quot;Papa's van&quot;  and there is plenty of room for them too.  There is room for the dog too.  

I used to have a lot of stuff piled up in my little wagon, but now I have all the same stuff, and there is room for everybody.  The ride is great, and we have taken it on many trips golfing and to the beach.  

There is only one problem with my van.  I hardly ever get to drive it!  My wife will take it shopping, or one of my daughters will just have to borrow it to haul something.  I guess that says something for it right there!  

It is capable of hauling a small trailor on the back, as we have hauled furniture to our home in SC behind it, and it still handled like a car.  I guess what I will probably have to do to get to drive my van more often is to buyone for my wife too!  

The only problem that I have had is that the decorative panel on the side of the driver door fell off.  I think that it was just from all the times it is opened and closed.  This is one busy vehicle! <br><br>
