            I replaced my fun, but bulky Olympus C-211 with this camera.  I've tried 5 different digital cameras, and could never get satisfied.  This one could be the one to make me stop spending money!

It has fantastic picture quality, most notably the near perfect color accuracy!  It beats all others I've tried in the 2.1 MP range for detail and color.  The optical zoom produces stunning close up images.  The macro mode allows closeups of 1.6", far better than most inexpensive cameras.  Though not meant to produce quality 8 x 10s, on good photo paper, the photos look fairly impressive at arm's length.

The second most appealing thing about this camera is its size.  It's downright tiny.  But Nikon has packed a ton of features into the camera, from assisted scene modes to on-camera editing.  

I never thought flash settings were any different from brand to brand, but the 2100's flash settings produce MUCH better quality dim light and night light pictures than others. Maybe I've just become a better photographer (unlikely!), but I haven't had a washed out flash picture yet.  However, the red-eye reduction is typical, barely reducing red-eye--and giving you that extra time to blur your picture!  

The framing assist modes are actually very useful and take little skill mastering.  The portrait assist is my favorite, allowing me to produce perfectly centered and focused portrait shots.  The party mode is nice as well, focusing both on background and fore image.  In fact, all the assist modes are great!

The camera shoots at ISO 100, 200 and 400--hard to find on cheap digital cameras!  

The shutter speed and recovery till the next picture is lightning fast.  It almost feels like my SLR when taking flash pictures.  There is virtually no shutter lag on this camera.

The navigation buttons are very easy to understand and very easy to use (unless you have large hands, that is!) and intuitive.  I took more than 50 pictures trying out the different settings before I had to go to the manual to look something up.

No lens cap to worry about, the 2100 has an automatic shutter door to protect the lens.

I've already dropped the camera twice (could be because it's so small!), and to my delight, there was no damage!

LCD screen could be sharper, but colors are very accurate. 

I never bother with the motion mode, but the book says it is a "silent" film mode, so no sound if that's your thing.

Battery life with 1800 NiMh rechargables is average.  The photo lithium pack it comes with isn't terrible, but replacement lithiums are expensive--so I'd recommend purchasing the rechargables. 

The package comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash card, lithium battery pack, strap, software and necessary cords.  I haven't bothered with the software, since I use a flash card reader.

Great camera if you want quality photos, but don't want to spend a lot of money.
