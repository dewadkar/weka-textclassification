            After graduating college I was looking into buying a new car.  I did hours and hours of research and finally narrowed it down to an SUV and a truck, due to the versatility that it would give me with New England weather.  After seeing the Sport Trac I basically fell in love.  The Sport Trac offers both the comfort and size of an SUV while adding a short bed perfect for the needs of the active youth.  Many people will nag and complain about how small the bed is, but I don't plan on hauling any sheets of plywood or numerous long pieces of lumber.  The bed is perfect for storing my disgusting and smelly hockey equipment and sticks without offending others with that classic hockey bag stench, storing golf clubs, hauling mulch, cinder blocks, taking the trash to the dump, and traveling.  Upon a recent trip to my Alma Mater(Syracuse University), I comfortably fit 5 adults and all of their luggage for a 5 and a half hour trip.  If there isn't enough room in the bed you have the roof rack for additional hauling.  

The interior is a different story.  Unlike other reviewers, I opted for all of the options with my Oxford White Sport Trac.  Leather Comfort Group, Sports Group, Convenience Group, 6 disc in-dash cd changer, moon roof, cargo cage, tonneau cover, etc.  I haven't experienced any problems with exterior noise, cargo cage rattling, or windows leaking and I have driven in every situation and occasion.  Maybe, I haven't noticed any of these because I have been too busy jammin' to my new stereo or I am just overly engulfed in how comfortable I am even after 5 hours of driving in my new leather seats.  Either or I can't complain about the exterior noise.  The interior was put together perfectly, every convenience was at the tip of my fingers, the radio did take me a couple of days to get used to though.  The radio also has additional controls on the back of the center console for the rear passengers.  The genius behind the controls is that they rear passengers can control the all functions but can not turn the radio up any higher than the front radio is set at.  With the push of the 3 and 5 presets, you can also turn of the rear passengers controls.  The best attraction on the Sport Trac is the electric sliding rear window.  On a nice day, opening the sun roof and rear window allows a perfect flow of air throughout the vehicle.  The Storage Space inside is adequate enough where you can put CD cases under the rear seats, in the center console or glove box.  There is even nifty little storage boxes behind the rear seats, where Ford has actually installed a mini Sub and a mini amp, which put out unbelievable sound.  

The only complaint that I really could think of is that Ford is out to screw you.  Not with the price, where I feel it was worth paying 30K for my car but with the options.  You basically can not get anything that you want unless you choose the package it comes in.  If I hadn't opted for ATA(all toys attached) I would have been very disgruntled.  The other part of this complaint stems from Ford making the extra buck by not offering the standard in a stripped down version.  If you want to drive a stick, Which I really did, you can not have the leather convenience group, 4 wheel drive, comfort convenience group, 6 disc in-dash stereo or the moon roof.  You would be saving $1000 dollars but all you could get was basically 4 wheels a frame and a couple seats.  Typical Ford.

I also decided on the Tonneau cover and cargo cage.  I believe that even at $600 dollars the Tonneau cover is a must.  It not only allows you to lock personal belongings in the trunk but it also takes away from the wind resistance and adds to the gas mileage.  The cargo cage also plays the role of bed partition, helping to keep objects in place and separated.      <br><br>
