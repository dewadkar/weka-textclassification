            My wife and I bought a new Ford Aspire in 1995. We needed a new car, but had very little money, so the Aspire was just about our only choice.

In the six years we have had it, we have had zero mechanical problems. The car now has 95,000 miles on it, and has only recently developed a small oil leak. We had to have some brake work done at 75,000, but otherwise it has been very cheap to operate and maintain. It gets 30 MPG in the city, and we've managed 45 on the highway under ideal conditions.

The car has been in two accidents, though neither was serious enough to trigger the airbag. 

Our only complaint is that with the A/C on during hot summer weather, the car has no power. But that's to be expected given the small engine. We have the manual transmission. The car is comfortable given its size, though both my wife and I are short.

Overall, the Aspire has been cheap, reliable transportation for us.
