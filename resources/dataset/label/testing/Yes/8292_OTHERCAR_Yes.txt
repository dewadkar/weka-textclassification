              I looked at the previous generation Corolla when I leased my previous vehicle - a Mazda Protege. The older Corolla did not have the room I needed but the new model overcomes that shortcoming admirably. A very roomy and comfortable interior with lots of storage spots- the door pockets, however, could be a big bigger. What is really a joy is how well the automatic transmission and engine work together -seamless shifts and a nice even flow of power. The ride is quite good and noise well controlled although there can be 
a bit of wind noise on the highway depending on direction of side winds. The handling is good but not sports car territory ( 195/60 tires might be my choice to replace the 185/65 OE ). The dash design is modern and has a great layout. 
   On the down side the fuel economy is about the same or marginally better than the Protege I owned-from published reports I expected a 15% improvement but this level of gain is not evident. Also the dome light switch is not lit - since its intended to be used in the dark then should it not be illuminated? As you can see this is nit -picking which reveals how a fine car it has been so far.
    A pleasant surprise was the minimal maintenance required. No spreadsheets in the manual showing what has to be down every 5000 miles just an oil change every 5000 miles- no timing chain replacement for example. 
   Overall all well balanced design -it just works.
