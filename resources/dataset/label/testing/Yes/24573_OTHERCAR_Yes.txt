            I had an epson photopc 650 as a first dig-camera. Some good and bad. Then I knew the things that I wanted in the next camera. Number one is zoom! Must have.I have taken a few bad shots only because I was too far away for the pic to be large enough to see well. Second, better resolution. Finally, value. The Toshiba fit all of my must have list. It feels like a real camera, not light weight like a few models with cases made of plastic. The m25 has not only a 3x optical zoom, but adds a 2x digital zoom. While I'm not a big fan of digital zoom, if your picture resolution is high enough, this is a plus. Optical zoom is what I really like. Took pics of same subject from far away and with zoom. No fuzziness when the zoomed pics where examined. A big plus not having to be right in someone's face to take a decent pic. Second, it has 2.3 mb resolution. I can see the difference in the zoomed pics alone! Printed out on a color laser printer and could only slightly see any blockiness at 8x10 printout size. The price was even more of a treat. Got it for $260 at BB. The nearest camera with the same features was at least 50 - 100 dollars more. The m25 even lets you capture 16 pics in rapid mode. Plus it will let you manually change the Iso setting (100,200,400), take pics in B&W and change the white balance! Easy to switch between the menus once you play with them for a while. My only wishes would be that the m25 would be a little larger, and allow you to turn off the flash manually. Always buy rechargeable batteries as this camera will take about 30-50 shots before it's toss em time (for alkaline batteries- rechargeable hi current one last about 3 - 4 times as long before charge time). Good good value for the price. (PS - I've owned Toshiba products and they really last a long time (microwave -10 yrs, tape deck 15 yrs, etc)
