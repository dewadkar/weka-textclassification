            Mazda has done a great job carving itself a little niche as the alternative Japanese auto maker.  Reliability is near the same as Honda or Nissan, but Mazda has a little more of an attitude - a little more artsy. It's obvious in their advertising, one recent TV ad borrows a Bowie tune; (the song is &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;) is that rebellious? Probably not but it still sounds cool.

With the playing field fairly level in terms of reliability, new cars are all about features and value, the Protege has both. Typically features like remote, keyless entry, 15 inch alloy wheels and 60/40 split folding rear seat are found in much bigger and more expensive cars, in ES trim, Protege has them all. 

Inside the Protege is roomy. Expect 4 adults to ride comfortably, even the back seats are surprisingly roomy.  Headroom is plentiful.  I am 6'1&quot; and could wear a baseball cap, even with a sunroof (sunroof/moonroof typically lowers the front headroom by 1 to 2 inches.)The trunk is large, especially for a compact car. <b>Seats</b> are firm, but not uncomfortable.  The drivers seat on the ES has knobs and adjustment I could only dream of in my more expensive 1999 Camry. The six speaker <b>Stereo</b> is better than average, a CD player is standard equipment, while a cassette player is a $250 option. Times change. <b>Ergonomics</b> could be better. The heating and A/C knobs and buttons seemed small to me, however all controls are well placed and the dash incorporates nice textures and high quality materials. Power windows and door-locks work well. I never had to &quot;hunt&quot; for any of the buttons or switches, I felt as if I had always driven this car.  <b>Gauges</b> are big, clear and easy to read. I often wished for a real clock instead of the digital one displayed on the CD player. The twin overhead map lights in front are a nice touch. My one interior complaints is road noise. It's no worse than any other car of its size, but I want what I want - Quiet.

On the road the Protege is actually fun to drive. <b>Handling</b> is very sporty, firm but sporty. I had an automatic, but a 5-speed would have added to the fun. <b>The automatic transmission</b> shifted up firmly but not harsh, downshifts are barely noticeable.<b> The Engine</b> is peppy. In ES trim you'll get a 1.8 twin-cam, inline 4 cylinder which produces 122hp. You won't win any drag races, but getting on the freeway is no problem, the Protege is not under-powered.  The engine is a bit buzzy, but this is the nature of high reving 4 cylinder engines. 

Even with a long list of options, the Protege is still a great value.  Less expensive than a Civic or Corolla and yet somehow cooler. This is the perfect car for the first-real-job-after-college group. <br><br>
