            I don't have a 1998 GMC Ext. Cab Dually, but I have a 1997 Chevrolet
Crew Cab Dually.  My truck is equipped with a 454 cu. in. V-8 (7.4L),
the 4L80E Automatic Transmission as well as 4 wheel drive.  I bought the truck to haul a 24 ft. travel trailer with 4 wheelers (ATV) and motorcycles in the bed.  I wanted the long wheelbase and the dual rear wheels for hauling stability.  I was towing and carrying in the neighborhood of 7,500 lbs.  The truck did what it was designed to do.
I Love the interior of the truck, equipped with Silverado trim, the comfort and convenience is wonderful.  The Electrochromatic rear veiw mirror is a nice touch.  The fold down armrests' on the front driver and passenger seat is quite nice.  The stability of the longer wheelbase and dual wheels is sure noticeable when towing and hauling under any condition.  I am quite impressed with the ride.  In one word?  Cadillac.
I also own a Chevrolet Astro Van, and my K3500 dually crew cab rides nicer than it does.  I am quite convinced that the General Motors factory uses higher quality parts and a better building process for the crew cab trucks
than the 1/2 ton trucks.  I have owned both.  My 97 is still quite tight and rattle free.  Common sense would dictate that you have to hang onto the door in windy conditions.  My 2 children love all the space they are afforded on the rear of the cab.  The only thing I do not like about this truck is the obnoxious fuel mileage.  I only get 8.2 mpg in the city or on the highway.  I am a conservative driver.  Driving this truck is like driving an up-line touring sedan in that the handling and performance is wonderful.  I often find myself &quot;Carving a turn&quot; because this truck feels rather sporty due to the firm suspension and precise steering.   I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants a truck that oozes style and bold good looks and has an affinity pure Chevrolet Big Block Muscle.  This truck pulls quite nicely on the hills.  I could pull a 6% grade with the travel trailer and ATV's in the truck @ 50 MPH. Quite impressed with the truck overall.
