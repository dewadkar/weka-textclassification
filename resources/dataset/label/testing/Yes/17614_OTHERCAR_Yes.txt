            The Plymouth Neon is a great car for anyone.  After my husband and I bought our minivan back in 98 around Labor Day...we had decided that his car would no longer hold up to his delivery job he had.  We decided to get him a new car too and proceeded to go looking one weekend not really intending to buy, but wanting to serious look.  We took off to some used car lots and didn't like the offer of money versus the year and make of car.  We wanted low mileage if we got a used car and had the hardest time finding a used car that fit the bill.  Last stop, we just happened into this deal.  We were tired and ready to just give up.  My husband didn't know exactly what kind of a car he wanted..he just wanted it to look somewhat sporty but get great gas mileage.  We look at this lot and he saw this cobalt blue car that had 4 doors instead of the typical 2 doors he usually came across.  It had funny looking headlights, but, that passed with the kids so that was not a big deal.  We looked at the name of the car and Plymouth Neon jumped out at us.  My husband stated he had seen ads for this car on tv and had actually liked the looks of the car.  Immediately, the salesman suggested a test drive.  Hmm...this is where my husband falls in love with the car and we wait around for hours waiting to get it.  We drove around the block and boom..of course, he wanted it. The car drove smooth...great gas mileage we soon found out, and the backseat was so roomy.  We have 4 children and needed a car that my husband could hall around kids to and from where needed.  This car offered that and more.  The looks are unique and so is the design.  The only thing I found fault with was I didn't like about this car is how low to the ground it sits.  I find myself intimidated by huge trucks! Other than that, I love the little car.   A good car for anyone, especially for kids just learning how to drive or college kids needing a good car to drive.  I love it. <br><br>
