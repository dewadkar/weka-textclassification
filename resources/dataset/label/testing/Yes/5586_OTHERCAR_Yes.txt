            I bought my Nikon CoolPix 2100 after some careful research. Basically it came down to getting this one or the Canon PowerShot A60. I decided to get this one because it's smaller and honeslty I just thought it looked better. I wanted to get a 2 megapixel camera for about $200 and this one met the criteria.

First off, the camera is obviously a very small (fits in pocket easily) and light weight. It only uses one CR-V3 battery or I think you can use two AA batteries. The CR-V3's cost about $10 each, or you can get a 2-pack for about $17. 

UPDATE: I checked, and you have many choices when it comes to batteries. Of course Nikon recommends using their own batteris (Nikon EN-MH1 NiMH rechargables) but you can also use regular AA batteries. I plan on buying rechargable ones, even though the CR-V3 batteries last a long time. I've had the camera for about two months now and I still haven't run out of power. But I don't use the camera everyday, and try to save the battery life.

Most people want to know about the picture quality. I can tell you that you won't be disappointed. My boyfriend has Canon PowerShot A70 (which is a 3.2 MP camera) and his pictures are really not *that* much better quality. As a default, my camera takes large pictures, but the quality is still there. I upload them onto my computer with the included cord, and use the Nikon's software to move the pics from the camera to the computer. The pictures are still good quality - even when they are wallpaper size!! 

The camera comes with many different picture modes from sepia to close ups. I haven't used them too much, I think it's just best to leave the selections to "Auto" and let the camera do the work. I just want to snap pictures everywhere I go and not worry about changing the modes. So far the camera has worked good inside and outside. The only bad part is that the flash is not very powerful. If you are taking a picture of something that is farther away, the flash won't be able to help you and the picture will end up dark. This can be fixed on the computer very easily though, so I don't let it bother me. 

UPDATE: I experimented with the sepia, black & white, and framing. I really liked them except for the framing. The sepia and black & white can be very useful sometimes. The framing just puts this white blurry shape around the picture. I don't think I will ever use it again - I can make a lot nicer frames on the computer. 

In summary, the Nikon CoolPix 2100 was worth the money. Just to let you know, the camera usually sells for $249, but you can find it cheaper online. I ordered mine online and got it for $205.
