            By today's standards, the 1984 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale is a monster of a car, and one which symbolizes the last gasp of breath for the large and boxy V8 powered luxury cruisers from a bygone era. It's huge interior and heavy feel seem foreign to the youth of today, and it's rear wheel drive layout is all but a mystery to most drivers anymore.

Yet, when seeking a good and dependable used car bargain, these old dinosaurs have plenty to offer to the astute shopper! Few vehicles can match it's simple lines and solid drivetrain, not to mention it's roomy and comfortable interior and many standard features.

My personal example is powered by the rock-solid 307 cubic inch (5.0 litre) Oldsmobile V8 engine, and backed with a TH250 Metric automatic transmission. Olds engines have long been touted for their throttle response, torque and reliability, and this one holds true to that legacy. The low compression ratio and effective combustion chamber design allow this beast to motor along happily on today's lowest octane unleaded gasolines without a trace of spark knock or run-on. The car delivers very impressive mileage numbers for a vehicle without an overdrive, and easily averages over sixteen miles per gallon so long as the driver refrains from stomping the pedal and opening up the massive secondary circut of the good old Rochester Quadrajet carburetor! Highway trips have scored me some even better figures, with a best observed total of 21 miles per gallon on one trip! 

The transmission shifts smooth and crisply with no slipping or noise, and shines as another example of why GM automatics are superior to other makes of this era. The car drives as a luxury car should, but has more than enough power to get up and go when called upon to do so!

One quirk with the Oldsmobile V8 engines in these cars is the poorly designed exhaust system, which uses a crossover assembly to link one exhaust manifold to the other. Like almost all other Oldsmobiles with this design, mine developed a leak there which made the car loud despite having a new muffler and exhaust system behind the manifolds. It is something to look out for when shopping for a used Olds with a V8, but nothing that a competent mechanic can't fix.

Another mechanical feature about this car that bothers me is the way that the power steering pump is located in a position that makes adding fluid a unique challenge. Let's face it, leaks and minor glitches are part and parcel of living with an older car, and this one is no exception! The only other observation involves the belts, which most experienced mechanics will confirm. The contact area between the belt and the pulleys on a few belt driven accessories is small enough to allow slipping if the belt tension is not carefully adjusted at all times on an Oldsmobile V8. Other than those minor problems, this engine lives up to it's heritage of long lasting service and smooth performance.

Behind the wheel, you realize that you are not driving a small car, but it is a confident and comfortable feeling, not a mushy and boat-like experience. The ride quality is incredible, and the power assisted disc brakes stop this beast quick and straight every time with no problem. Drivers who know how to use a vehicle's brakes correctly have no need for anti-lock brakes, and this car is thankfully NOT equipped with them! The steering feel is easy and precise, with just enough feedback to the driver to let you know that the wheels are turning. Power to pass or to merge into traffic is right there when you need it, and the car glides along at freeway speeds without effort!

Other features worth noting are the spacious trunk area, the full sized spare tire, the excellent factory sound system, and the quality construction on a full perimeter styled frame. With the exception of the Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis, this type of full sized car is long gone from today's new vehicle market.

In an economy such as ours, it may make sense to look into buying a good, solid used car that has plenty to offer and many trouble-free miles still left in it rather than spending up to a hundred times more for a brand new vehicle which has yet to prove itself. These cars can be purchased on the used market for anywhere between $200 and $2500, and will hold their resale value as more and more people discover just how sound these older cars were! Families with a couple of children on a tight budget will praise this car for it's room and comfort, and will be able to afford to keep it on the road for a long time to come. That is what defines a true automotive bargain!
