            I drive a 1990 Suzuki Swift GLX 1.6 AUTO, the more powerful of the SWIFTS from 1990. I am 18, and here in Australia that is when your start driving. This car has been fantastic to me. I have crashed it, drivin' it hard and it still bounces back. With a nice stereo it can be great fun. The 1.6 takes off like crazy at the lights and any smartarse beside you who thinks your swiftie baby is a girl's car, weak, has no muscle etc. will be surprised as your speedy, lightweight, economical, quiet swift relegates his loud and noisy utility &quot;man's car&quot; to second place. 

Mine is in pretty good condition and its paint (duco) is in a very good way (it has been garged for the last ten years). Tires are cheap and small, and you won't even care if the arab nations put up oil barrel prices because you are a member of a very select few, a proud 90' SWIFT owner. A word of advice though, if you ever smash any part of your vehicle, get the part shipped to your home and try to put it on yourself, if not give your part to someone who knows how (eg: headlight lens was smashed or something) you save so much money.

THANKYOU SWIFTIE BABY!!<br><br>
