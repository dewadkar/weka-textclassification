            Ever since 1953 Chevrolet has produced the Corvette, a vehicle which has been America's sportscar posterchild.  In 1998 it was difficult for it's competition not to pale in comparison.  For the performance the Corvette delivers, especially with optional LS1 V8 engine, you might expect to pay much more than the $43,000 sticker.

Depending upon your nature, and bankbook, you have a few options at your disposal.  The hardtop performer, congenial coupe, or the condescending convertible.  All of which are stellar choices.

Sizing up the competition:
It's not fair to compare the Corvette (stock) with the Mustang Cobra, SVT, or in some cases the Saleen.  It is however closer related to the Dodge Viper which possesses a much heftier price.  For styling purposes, you have two very aggressive vehicles.  The Corvette a little more Italian visage and the Viper just overall outlandish.  With the LS1 package, the Corvette distributes 345hp along it's almost cat-like demeanor which responds applicably so.

Auto Especial:
What gives the Corvette the edge over it's competition?  Legendary and unsurpassable history.  The Corvette is a proven performer day in and day out.  Even with this car being more prevalent than that of the Viper, you will still attract head turners from all around.  The Corvette services it's owner well in any situation where two passenger vehicles are suited.  With more power than needed, the Corvette can provide a generous escape route in warp speed, quick reflexes in case of road hazards, and the time your in laws visit.
