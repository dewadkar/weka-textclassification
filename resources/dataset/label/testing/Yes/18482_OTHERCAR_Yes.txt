            We bought our first Dakota back in 1993 and now wouldn't own any other brand of truck. The club cab feature provides room for all three of our children and still enough leg room for my 6' husband to be comfortable.
This truck has been through the ringer and still comes back for more. Now
after 6 years, 195,000 miles, pulling 16' stock trailers full of horses and cattle it is still going strong. We originally bought the truck for a &quot;home to work&quot; vehicle but this little work horse has been a God send.
It has had tires replaced three times, oil changes every 3,000 miles and no major repairs needed. The paint has held up under the harsh reality of sitting at a chemical plant 5 days a week. 

There was only two drawbacks to the Dakota. The first is the cruise control and air conditioning went out the second year and these were not covered by the extended warrantee. No air conditioning in Texas in the summer can be rough. The cruise control was easily lived with out.

If you are looking for a dependable, long lasting truck that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, check out the Dakota!
