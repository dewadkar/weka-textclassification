            My husband and I just bought a 2000 Dodge Dakota 4x4 Sport model truck with the extended cab. I totally LOVE this truck. The reason we bought it was the fact that we could get a V8 engine for towing our boat. The other smaller trucks don't offer V8's for an engine and the Dakota is a little bigger than the other small trucks. It has a lot of power! It is a fun truck to drive, and the steering is really tight for a truck. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is only 2 doors. Other extended cab trucks have 3 or 4 doors and seems like that would be more convenient, but we don't have any kids, so the wouldn't be used much anyways. I recommend this truck to everyone who is looking for the smaller size truck, unless you have kids that would need to ride in the back and it is your only vehicle.  <br><br>
