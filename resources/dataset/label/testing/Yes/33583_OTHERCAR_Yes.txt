            My friend recently bought the 2003 BMW M3. This is one of the most amazing sports cars I have ever had the pleasure of driving. My friend bought the car new and got most of the available options. 

To start off, the car looks beautiful from the outside. The curves and lines make the car look sleek and fast. My friend bought the car in black and upgraded the rims and lights to give the car an extra sporty look. 

The inside of the car is nice too. As with most sports cars, there aren't as many luxuries as you would expect in other high end cars but there are plenty to let you know you are driving a BMW. 

One of the great things about this car is the roominess. My friend is 6'2". He has had many problems trying to squeeze himself into small sports cars, but when it comes to the M3, he had no trouble. There is plenty of leg and head room and there is no squished claustrophobic feeling at any time. 

The controls, especially the most important - the stick, are within easy reach of the driver. The stick itself is positioned at a good height for someone tall or short. It is higher than many sports cars I have seen, yet lower than those that expect you to drive while on your back. 

The view out the windows is much better than those of other sports cars. Often, when the top is up on cars like this the almost non-existent back window is nearly impossible to see out of, the side windows are too small to look through, and the front window is angled and small. The M3 though, has windows large enough to see out of, and reduces the angle of the front window enough to make it much easier to see through. 

The stereo is very comfortable and easy to use in the car. It is powerful enough so that it can easily be heard even when cruising at highway speeds with the top down. The speakers are located in prime positions and are strong enough to handle anything. 

The handling of the car is superb. There is almost no roll even when cornering at high speeds. The car is built to be driven and does its job well. The steering is very smooth and allows you to feel the road so that you can make the micro adjustments sports car enthusiasts love to make. 

The shifting is incredibly fun to use. I grew up on manual cars and have always loved driving them. The surge in power at a downshift and the boost in speed when flying through the gears are a huge rush. The M3&#146s strong engine makes driving a dream. There is plenty of power to shift through in every gear. Many cars often have a weak second gear but the M3 holds its power. The shifting is made easy by a well tuned shifting mechanism that allows for maximum control in any situation. 

The aesthetics of the inside are also pleasing for a passenger. The car has a unique look to it that only BMWs possess. Plus, the car is not only eye candy for the passenger, but treats them nicely as well. The passenger side is just as comfortable if not more comfortable than the drivers side.
