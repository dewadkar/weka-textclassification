            I bought my 1995 Chevy Cavalier used in '96.  My car was on its way out and, in the market for something &quot;new&quot;, I wanted to check out the Cavalier.  I had seen the newly redesigned model on the road and was in love.  The old Cavaliers were nothing special.  They were squarish and then got rounded in the back in the later models, but were just &quot;there&quot;, I never gave them a second thought.  
I bought mine from a Mitsubishi dealer for a good price.  It had been a trade-in and import dealers just don't want used domestic cars sitting around.  It was advertised in the newspaper and I called (knowing it was a great deal), asking (out of curiosity) what color it was.  It's raspberry.  After seeing it, I liked the way it drove and liked the features.  I asked myself if I would get tired of the purplish-pink color.  Well, I've had it a little over three years now.  Sometimes I do wish I had another color Cavalier.  Black is especially pretty.  I still drool over the body style (2 door coupe with side trim only) when I see others on the road, if they're in good shape.
Some drawbacks are as follows.  If living in the city where you must parallel park, the models with the painted bumpers will get knicked, showing the gray material beneath.  I found this out within just a week of buying mine, unfortunately.  I got the many nicks repaired along with body work from someone hitting me, luckily, just before moving to the 'burbs, where I don't parallel park!  There are models with black rubber-like bumpers.  But I had not thought about that prior to buying my Cavalier.  Also, the wheels have buckled slightly when being hit on a curb.  Again, parallel parking.  My blue Chevy symbol on the trunk fell out of the chrome molding that held it.  But that's it for drawbacks.
It drives well.  The styling is beautiful, inside and out.  I have a sunroof, theatre-style lighting, &quot;airplane lights&quot; (don't know correct term for on/off individual lights on underside of rearview mirror for driver and passenger, fold-down back seat for access to trunk, trunk release, tilt steering, cruise control, storage between seats, delay wipers.  I've had no troubles mechanically.
