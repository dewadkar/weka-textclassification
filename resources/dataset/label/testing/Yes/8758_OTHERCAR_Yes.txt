            When I first saw the ECHO in 1999 as a new model for 2000, I was shocked by it, not sure about the styling and never considered it a choice for my next new car. I have had an ECHO for 5 months now and like the car a lot.  I have had some interesting experiences with the car, this is my second one, the first was totaled in a 60-70 MPH head on collision with an out-of-control Ford truck, I will go into all the details about that later.

After driving a 2 door Toyota Tercel for 7 trouble free years, I was ready for something bigger with 4 doors and sat higher on the road. I was considering an SUV and, after doing a lot of research, even knew the model I wanted. But gas prices aren't getting cheaper and I decided that I really was not going to get all the uses out of an SUV for the price and wanted something more friendly to the environment. Then I noticed in a parking lot an ECHO parked next to a Honda CRV and the ECHO was almost the same height as the CRV, which is unusual for an economy car.  This is nice since I am 6&#146 tall and like a lot of head room.  So I started doing more research on the ECHO on www.carreview.com and realized that people were very happy with the ECHO after a year of owning it. Most professional reviews I saw recommended the Ford Focus over the ECHO, but I noticed that many people are having problems with the Focus, a lot of problems, as early as 6 months after buying it new and weren't happy, especially with all the re-calls on the Focus.  Since I have always had good luck with Toyota, I decided to test drive an ECHO during a sale at the dealership and I was amazed at how easy it was to drive and how high up I sat, at eye level with most SUVs. 

<b>Under the hood:</b>
The ECHO has DOHC 16-Valve VVT-I 4-cylinder engine (Honda calls this V-TEC) with 108 horse power.  VVT-I stands for Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence.  Basically, instead of 8 valves, it has 16 and a complex timing to get the optimum gas mileage from a gas engine.  The Ford Focus still uses only 8-valves and from what I have read, drivers average only 28 MPG or even less.  On the ECHO, you can get a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.  I have the manual transmission and it gets 34/41 MPG according to Toyotas specs, but I average about 42 MPG (city/highway mix) and I have heard other drivers getting 47 MPG highway.

After test driving other $20,000+ mid-size SUVs, I enjoy driving the Echo more, it feels more peppy. 

<b>Interior:</b> 
I like the location of the gauges in the center of the dash, when I brought it to work the first time, everyone had to come out and sit in it out of curiosity, they agreed that it was easier to look at while driving. The gauges have a white background and glow green at night with the lights on to look like an indiglo watch. The extra storage compartments are great, there is room for everything and the trunk is huge! The interior may not please everyone because there is no fake wood or leather, but I think it&#146s very styling and seems to be durable (so far), the seats are very comfortable and the high head rests are nice.  Like Nissan says in the Xterra ad, &#147Everything you need, nothing you don&#146t&#148.  The sound system is awesome!  I wonder if there is a sub woofer hidden somewhere. I am 6 ft tall and there is plenty of head and leg room in both the front and back seats. I have the 4 door model which holds 5 adults and luggage comfortably and still handles well. 

<b>Exterior:</b>
I have the sports cladding package with the black/gray plastic lining the underside of the car, I think it makes it look better and protects it from dents and dings.  I also have 14&#148 tires that seem appropriate with the look.  There are many benefits to the extra height that include more head room and better visibility.  It&#146s also very easy to get in and out of with the height.  I am very satisfied with this car, I like that it looks different than most cars on the road, I feel like I am driving a car out of a sci-fi movie. I know a lot of people think it is strange looking or even ugly, but I did at first and now think it&#146s a refreshing change of pace from most other sedans on the road.

<b>Other good things:</b>
The headlights are much brighter than any other car I have driven. The windshield wipers have 3 settings (int., low and high) which are perfect. The air conditioning works great, cools the cabin down quick. 

<b>Overall:</b>
It&#146s a different, fun to drive car that&#146s a great value with an advanced, efficient engine. Worth a test drive. 

<b>The Accident:</b>
It's Monday and I am supposed to be at work, not in a rental Toyota Corolla, armed with my Sony Mavica, heading to a town about 50 miles from me in the middle of no where to get personal belongings from and pictures of my totaled Echo that is not even 3 weeks old! It was totaled just 36 hours ago on Saturday while we were coming home from Orlando, Florida after shopping for a bridesmaid dress for my sister's wedding. 

But maybe I should start from the beginning of that nightmare trip. It was about 5 PM on a rainy August day and we were still stuck at the Orlando mall waiting for the rain to stop so we could make a mad dash out to my ECHO for the trip home. Hopeless, we went back to the food court to get a Barneys coffee for the remainder of the wait, I got raspberry flavor, not knowing that the smell will haunt me for years to come. At last, the rain finally let up to a minor sprinkle and the lighting calmed down, so we made the made dash for my ECHO and headed for home. As I was driving, the storm started getting worse, it was down pouring and the lighting was coming down in every direction. Because I have lived in Florida so long, driving in storms does not bother me, especially in the summer, we seem to get them every evening. We finally cleared the town and got on highway 50. There was a decent amount of traffic and the rain was still very bad.  I was in the fast lane going about 55 MPH when up ahead we noticed a king cab Ford truck on the other side spinning out of control ahead.  It spun through the wide grass median and into my direction, then it crossed over to the side of the road and I thought it would stop there, but it didn't. An large SUV was beside me in the slow lane, so I was not able to see what was going on and I was watching the traffic in front, when out of now where, the spinning truck slid in front of the SUV and ended up sliding head on to me side ways partially in the fast lane and the median. With the SUV next to me, there was nothing I could do, I could not swerve to the slow lane or median. I just remember slamming on my brakes thinking "Oh Sh*t!" and then looking at a smoking airbag trying to figure out what happened, hoping this was a bad dream. What made it worse was it was still down pouring and the windshield was shattered and my drivers window was broken out, rain was dumping into the car and it was cold. My hand was bleeding bad from the glass which I did not notice it until I was rubbing my sore face. With me was my fianc� in the front passenger seat and my mom in the back seat, all seat belted. I was starting to panic because my mom was in the back seat almost in tears saying she was not able to breath from the seat belt. The highway patrol officer instructed us to stay in the car because on the lighting and wait for the paramedics. When the they arrived, they threw a tarp other the drivers side to block the rain while the get my mom out of the back first, my fianc� had already gotten out to make sure everyone was okay, I was not able to because the drivers door would not open, the truck was at an angle when we hit him, so there was more damage to the drivers side. After they got my mom in the ambulance, they helped me out through the passengers side, covered me with another tarp to keep the rain off and took me to the ambulance, I never got to see the outside of my car on the scene. I was more concerned about my mom having a hard time breathing, even though the paramedics said this was normal from the seat belt. In the ambulance, we finally got to the hospital and after many x-rays, they found that my moms sternum was fractured, not badly. My fianc� and I were pretty much okay, we both have skin burns on our noses from the airbags and I have cuts from the drivers side window glass on my hand, the airbag must have threw my hand in that direction when the window broke. 

We were all VERY sore, I think every muscle hurt in my body.  No one had any major injuries.  It was estimated that this was a head on collision at about 60-70 MPH, including the speed the truck was sliding at me and we were all able to go home that night. Of course the ECHO is totaled, both airbags deployed, the frame was bent, the engine was destroyed. When I got to the junk yard/towing company that the car was kept at, the towing guy looked at me in shock and said "you were the one driving it!?!" I saw why as soon as I saw the car from the outside. The poor car smelled like that raspberry coffee from Barneys, it was all over the floor inside inside. It looked a lot worse that it was, half of the front was not even recognizable as an Echo, but the cabin and foot well area was still intact and there was not engine intrusion anywhere. 

Overall, the car did well and I was very sad to see it in such a horrible condition. But considering the accident and that people have died accidents less serious, I am very grateful for it.  I looked closely at my ECHO after the accident and compared it to crash test photos of other cars at only 40 MPH and the ECHO is a safe vehicle.  One of its advantages is that the driver and front passenger sit far from the dashboard and steering wheel.  During the impact, the dashboard did not shift and my long legs did not hit it.  In crash test photos on other cars like the 2002 Hyundai Elantra, the dummy&#146s legs went through the dashboard.   Also, the passenger airbag deploys from the top of the dashboard in the ECHO, not in front of the passenger like in other cars.  I notice while riding in my sisters 98 Saturn SC2, if I was not careful of how I was sitting, my legs were blocking the compartment were the airbag would come out in front of me which can result in bad leg injuries.  I think we were very lucky, but I am angry that the guy in the truck lost control and destroyed my new car and weekend at the worst time possible. The cop indicated that he was possibly speeding and swerved to avoid hitting a car on his side when he lost control. I have a ton of pictures on the car after the accident, e-mail me if you want any.  

I had a 2001 Toyota Corolla rental while between ECHOs and it made me miss the ECHO because it was more fun to drive. The Corolla sites lower, does not have as much leg room or trunk room and the visibility in the ECHO is better. The Corolla is a good car, handles great on the highway, but does not seem to have as much power as the ECHO or as much character.  I was looking forward to replacing the ECHO as soon as possible. 

4 days after the accident, insurance gave me the full amount for the car, including the new stereo added and the window tinting and I got the new ECHO shortly after. I got a better deal on the second ECHO, another 4-door silver model. I was not able to locate on with option pack 3, side airbags or ABS in Florida. Some dealers even said that the ECHO does not have side airbags available, when Toyota's site says it's an option.  While at the dealership looking for ECHO 2, I told the accident story to a salesman and had pictures.  He commented that seeing these makes him want to consider wearing his seatbelt.  WHAT AN IDIOT!  I would&#146ve hoped that a car salesman would know better, but guess not.  I lost a lot of respect for him when he said that and did not buy a car from him.  After this whole experience, I can&#146t stress enough how important it is to wear a seatbelt (well duh, it&#146s the law).  My mom would most likely have broken her neck in the back seat and/or have been thrown out the back window and killed if she was not wearing her seatbelt, I don&#146t even like to think about that.  Instead she is fine and living life as normal.  But I still hear about people being killed in accidents because they were not wearing a seatbelt.  I had no control in this accident and it can happen to anyone.  In case anyone is in the habit of not wearing a seatbelt, I really hope reading this makes you m re-think that.

For the ECHO reviews I have read from users who do not own one and say it is not safe, I know that it is safer that many other new cars on the road and I feel very safe in it.
