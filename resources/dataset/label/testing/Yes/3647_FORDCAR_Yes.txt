            <b>For</b> years I wanted one of these.  I owned two Ford Tauruses (a 1987 and a 1995...see my other eopinions reviews) and I've long felt that the Crown Vic was a significant step up over the Taurus.  Unfortunately, the only Crown Vics I could afford were lumped-up, tired Police Interceptors, since taxi companies routinely snatch up all of the clean CVs and even the decent Police Interceptors on the used car market.

<b>During</b> 2001 I saw this trend relax somewhat, and used CVs became affordable...sort of.  I finally found a 2000 CV Standard for $10,000 in February of 2002.  It had a few scratches and nicks but seemed to be in fine condition otherwise, so I bought it.  While performing routine service, I discovered that the torque converter was equipped with a drain plug, making it very easy to change the transmission fluid, an important maintenance task.  This was my first pleasant surprise.

<b>I�ve</b> lived with it for nearly four months now and the experience has been very positive.  The Crown Vic reminds me of nothing so much as the Lincoln Town Cars my dad drove for so many years, and in fact, the basic platform is very similar.  The ride is very smooth and quiet, soaking up bumps and pavement imperfections with evident ease.  Very little road or wind noise intrudes on the passenger compartment, even at cruising speeds of 70 MPH or so.    

<b>The</b> standard 2.73 rear axle ratio and .80 overdrive give the Crown Vic driver a real long-legged feel on the highway.  It�s capacity to swallow up the miles at high speed while the 4.6 litre V-8 loafs along at relatively low RPM is impressive.  Likewise, maintaining speed on modest hills is easy, not a constant exercise in gear shifting.  Acceleration from a stop is less satisfying.  Floor the pedal and the Crown Vic sort of �oozes� forward, gradually gathering speed.  Shift points, even at WOT, are too low, tailored for smoothness and quiet.  You can improve the shifting with an EEC unit from a wrecked Police Interceptor, about $75 from a junkyard and ten minutes to install.  Fuel economy is a bit better than I expected , 16 MPG or so city and well over 20 on the highway.   

<b>Handling</b> is surprisingly good for a car of this size and weight.  The Watts four-link rear suspension, new for 1998, is so good at keeping the car planted squarely that I was surprised to discover there was no rear anti-sway bar.  The speed-sensitive variable boost power steering adds a wonderful European GT flavor to the equation�clearly, this isn�t the clumsy, lumbering LTD of years past.  The Crown Vic is easy to drive fast on winding roads, so long as you remember that the suspension is calibrated for a very soft ride.  Driven hard on a rough, uneven road, it is likely to surprise you by bottoming out with a loud, embarrassing scrape of its (flexible) front air dam.

<b>Luckily</b>, the Crown Vic is easy to upgrade.  For about $100, you can buy four Police Interceptor shock absorbers from Ford, providing better control and less �wallow� on secondary roads.  For improved cornering, bolt on a rear anti-sway bar (about $55 from Ford, or $100 on the aftermarket from Addco).  A numerically higher rear axle gearset, such as 3.27 or 3.55 (about $200), can significantly improve your low-speed response and acceleration, at the cost of one or two miles per gallon.  Of course, you can simply buy a Crown Vic Sport or HPP (short for Handling and Performance Package) and get this stuff included, along with a real, honest-to-God dual exhaust system.  Personally, I found that Sports and HPPs command too high a price on the used market, plus they tend to include things I don�t want.  A used Police Interceptor has this equipment too, but definitely look a PI over <b>very</b> carefully before buying one.

<b>Things</b> I don�t want?  Air suspension, for one, is just an electronic and mechanical complication that I don�t need.  I carry 600 pounds or more daily in my CV, with no ride height issues at all.  Anti-lock brakes are another.  The 2000 Crown Vic has huge, upgraded disk brakes, the stopping capability of which continues to amaze me.  It will consistently stop in a shorter distance than most cars a thousand or more pounds lighter.  Anti-lock braking adds mechanical and electronic complication, making your braking system impossible or impractical for many mechanics to service and outrageously expensive to service at the dealer.  Ditto Ford�s �Traction Control�, which basically cuts off your ignition when your tires start to spin.  A much better choice is Ford�s venerable �Traction-Lok�, which will transfer power to both rear wheels as needed.  Best of all, Traction-Lok is fully self-contained, does not tie into your electronic or computer systems, and usually outlasts the automobile.  You can even purchase a unit from Ford (about $250) and have it installed on your existing Crown Vic.

<b>Ready</b> for the bad stuff?  Ford, like most auto manufacturers, plays a game of constantly decontenting and de-engineering their product, and the CV is no exception.  You don�t get a map light in a plush $24,000 Crown Vic, something that was standard in every other Ford I ever owned, including trucks.  My Tauruses both had fingertip stereo controls for the driver.  Not so the CV, in fact, you really have to stretch to reach them.  There�s no center armrest for the rear passengers.  The cupholders are adequate for only the smallest size soft drinks, plus, they block the climate controls.  And the carpet pile gets thinner every year.  As of 2000, it is down to 12 ounces.  To put this into perspective, the carpeted floor mats I purchased for it are 42 ounces.  These are items which save Ford virtually nothing but push buyers toward the more heavily contented, much more expensive, LX model.

<b>Overall</b>, I am pleased with the CV.  There is just the right blend of the old (front engine V-8, rear drive) and the new (such as the Fail-Safe Cooling System).  It is very roomy and comfortable, and isolates the driver well from the outside environment.  There is an unmistakable feel of bank-vault solidity and security, partially due to an old-fashioned, full length steel frame.  With firmer shocks and a rear anti-sway bar, you can even put on your racing gloves and throw the CV into a sharp turn at a higher speed than you would have thought possible.  It�s reliable, and safe too, a good alternative to SUVs for anyone who needs to carry three or four passengers in comfort.  The trunk is well laid-out, and absolutely huge.  This car is an excellent choice for a long trip!
