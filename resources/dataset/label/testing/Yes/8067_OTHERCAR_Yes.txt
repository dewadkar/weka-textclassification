            We recently purchased a 1996 Nissan Quest, and we absolutely love it! It is our second minivan, we traded in an older Mazda MPV (which was also a good van) for the Nissan. We didn't set out to buy a Nissan, we just happened upon it. And are we lucky we did. We had a couple &quot;requirements&quot; we were specifically looking for when we set out on our &quot;quest&quot; for a new(er) van. One was rear air conditioning, living in Southern California that's a must, and the other was a sliding door. We have a pretty small garage and the open-out door on the Mazda made for very little room with two cars in the garage. The Nissan met both of these requirements. <br>The Nissan is an extremely comfortable van, and it drives very smoothly. From the first test drive I was sold on it. The rear air conditioning is even better than we'd hoped for, and the stereo controls at the middle seat are a plus. Our Nissan came with a keyless entry system and an alarm.The cargo area in the back is very spacious, you can stash lots of groceries back there!  It is also a very unique color, a sort of deep blue that is almost purple at night. Very pretty.<br> We haven't had any mechanical problems, and the gas mileage is reasonable. And the V6 engine really has some get up and go! On the down side,  the brakes are a little squeaky. We were told this is a result of Nissan's metallic brake pads. And although we have a nice stereo, there is no CD player. But overall, I am very happy with our purchase, and would highly recommend the Nissan Quest to anyone in the market for a minivan.<br><br><br>
