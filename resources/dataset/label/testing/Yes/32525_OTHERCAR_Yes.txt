            I bought this vehicle because of the way I was treated at the dealer. I have never been treated with this much respect by car salesmen, especially used car salesmen! The price was right and I was able to see a history of work that had been done on my car. I have never heard anything bad about Saturns.

I love just about everything about my car. The seats are comfortable even though they have no extra lumbar support. It is reasonably easy to get in and out of the back seat. I just have the basic radio but the sound quality is exceptional. I take it in every 3,000 miles it is now nearing 60,000. I have never been suprised by any charges because I was given a list of what each service would cost at the time of purchase. I just recently had to have new tires put on my car because the original ones finally wore down. There is also a low fuel light that comes on when you have a gallon left. It is nice to have that reminder. The back seats do fold down which helps with long items that won't fit in the trunk. 

Saturns also feature siding that doesn't dent, I've tested it accidentally and this holds true. Another safety feature I like has to do with airbags. Unlike some cars Saturns have sensors that keep airbags from deploying in small collisions like when you hit a curb or just barely hit another car. This keeps the driver and passenger from being hurt by the force when it is not needed. It also removes the cost of having the airbag put back in.

The main complaint I have is the pick up of the car. It is sometimes hard to quickly gain speed like when entering highways. However there is a performance mode that helps it switch gears faster. It does use more gas in this mode. I get pretty good mileage but the gas tank is small so it seems like I have to stop alot. The only other complaint I have is regarding the leg room in the back. It isn't good for adults in the back seat. The back seats aren't very comfortable either. The front is ok although after a few hours of constant driving they get iffy like most. 

This car should be purchased for reliability yet style. It's a cute car. I am 18 and wanted a car that fit me. It is just sporty enough for me without having the expensive price tag. My car is still going strong after 60,000 miles. The only major problem was the alternator going out under warranty at about 45,000.

I would not buy this car if you are planning on having more than two adults in it on many occasions. I don't sit in the back but have heard that it is not comfortable for people around 6ft tall. It didn't fit much when I was moving either. These complaints come from it being two door I think although most two door cars are around the same size inside.<br><br>
