              First off, I am going to start by saying this car stole my heart the very first time I saw it. It is absolutely beautiful. The lines that the gurus at Dodge used on this car are immaculate. One of my friends seriously asked me if it had a v12. A V12!. I chuckled and said &quot;if I had two of them then yes.&quot; The car screams performance. That is, the outside of the car screams performance. The car itself is actually fairly sluggish in the acceleration department. There are 3 reasons for this: 1 the v6 is one of the smallest available six cylinder engines on the market (2.5 liters), The car weighs just over 3500 pounds(shes a beast!!!), and the transmission, the Chrysler 604, is straight out of the one and only Town and Country. For those of you who aren't car buffs, the Town and Country is a minivan. To be honest, I have no idea why Dodge would shove the transmission from a minivan into what appears to be their sportiest car. You can tell immediately that the transmission was not built for performance. When the gas pedal is floored, it takes about 1.5 seconds for the car to do anything. The only way to correct this is to shift the gears yourself. The problem would be easily solved with a manual transmission, however, someone at Dodge thought this was a bad idea so they don't even offer one. Dodge cant be blamed for the underpowered engine though, that is purely Mitsubishi. They have a partnership to build this car with them. Therefore, the Avenger shares many of the characteristics of the 95-99 model Eclipses. They have the exact same interior and suspension. This is a major plus. Even though the car ways almost 2 tons, it still handles very well. It is truly a blast to drive on windy roads. The lack of power can be gotten over easily with a few minor additions in the performance parts arena. A good air induction system, and a reworked exhaust will almost completely solve the problem. This car is absolutely beautiful. If you can get past the fact that it looks better than a Mustang, but accelerates like a Contour, then this car is for you. I have loved and cherished mine for 2 years now.<br><br><br>
