              This is my 2nd GT and have been a Stang fanatic since childhood, so I'm familiar with the car. I recently purchased a 1998 Mustang GT with 33,000 miles to replace my 95 that I regretfully sold. The car has Ford's 4.6 litre modular engine instead of the old pushrod 5.0. The engine is a lot quieter than what you would expect from a "musclecar". Also, it redlines to 6000 rpm instead of 5500 like the 5.0. The car has a more of an import feel to it because of it's smooth revving 4.6, which makes for a very comfortable everyday car. The transmission has also been changed (5-speed) from the old T-5 to the T-45. What that means is that is shifts a lot smoother than the 95 and earlier cars. I know that a lot of readers aren't into engine and transmission numbers, but I am trying to explain why this is a much better car so I am writing what I KNOW to be factual and why. Naturally, it isn't a family car so the leg and hip room leave a little to be desired if you are over 6'1. The back seat will accomodate two small children but nothing more. The car has a 15.4 gal. fuel tank and gets 18 mpg city and 25 mpg hwy. This averages out per tank to 277.2 miles per tank city and 385.0 miles per tank highway. I drive one daily and these figures are close
depending on your elevation and how heavy your foot is! (LOL, even an opinion needs some humor!) I don't know the actual square footage for the trunk but it is of moderate size for this type of car, especially with the rear seats folded down. This is my second GT and dependabilty as been nothing short of perfect! The Mach 460 stereo is superb for a factory system, so if you get tired of changing gears, it will rock! Overall, with my past with this car, looks like it will be in my garage for a while.
