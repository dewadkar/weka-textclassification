              My wife was overdue for a new car so we started looking around. She wanted something with 4 doors, decent pep and gas mileage and something a little sporty in a reasonable price range. Not an easy order to fill, but we narrowed it down to a couple of cars...the Grand Am and, with a little reluctance, the PT Cruiser. Reluctance only because it had to be ordered and the dealer had no idea when it would be in. We could not drive it before we ordered it and had no idea what kind of acceleration or handling we would experience. I had a '99 Grand Am with the quad 4 engine and I knew I was getting around 22 mpg in town and as high as 33 on the road. Since the Cruiser has the same size engine, I figured we'd get close to those numbers..

  NEVER ASSUME!

  We haven't seen the top side of 18 mpg since we got it. Acceleration is very mediocre and I tremble when I think of what we'll get for performance and mileage in the heat of the summer with the A/C on. Turning it on now is like deploying a drag chute on a landing B-52.

  I've read several other opinions and some of them list the price in the $16,000 to $21,000 range. Although that is the actual pricing in the book for Cruisers, be prepared to fork over at least $21,000 unless you got on an order list last summer. Even then you'll probably be getting a 2002 model at a higher price. The last time I saw prices footballed like this was for the 1979 Corvette Pace Car.

  Performance notwithstanding, it's still a fun car to drive. The styling definitely turns heads and the interior is nostalgic and clean. The power windows are a little funky with the front being mounted in the center of the dash and to activate the rear you have to reach down at the end of the center console. Not unhandy but very "unique" which fits in with the rest of the car. Both front windows are auto down. The seats aren't the most comfortable but adequate.

  Our Limited is loaded. Power everything plus sunroof, ABS, traction control, side airbags, 4 wheel discs, CD, etc.
And the workmanship is good so that we've had no problems to date. The passenger seat could use an armrest but I'm happy with the amenities otherwise.  Later models have an optional storage box under the passenger seat that
would be well worth the $25 or so it costs to hold your CDs. There is an adjustable cover/table over the trunk for you sports tailgaters.

  All things considered, I would recommend the PT Cruiser as long as you're not concerned with power or mileage.
