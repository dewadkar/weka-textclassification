            I will admit my personal bias upfront.  We've owned many Saabs ('89 900 Turbo, '89 9000 CD Turbo, '96 900S [reviewed here], '97 9000 Aero, and this 9-5 V6 wagon) and I like them a great deal.  Not so much so that I am blindedly one-sided, though.  I have always thought that Saabs were near-perfect cars in that they blend style, uniqueness, performance, efficiency, and practicality better than almost any other car in automotive history.  Yet, Saab owners have traditionally had to pay for that perfection with irritating quirks, both big and small.  Things like expensive maintenance, noisy/harsh rides, fussy reliability (especially with age), and turbo lag will take their toll on even the most dedicated Saab fanatic over time.  The Nine Five is the Saab that changed Saab, and that's a great thing.  Naysayers will say that GM has ruined Saab, but Saab is still Saab, only now they have the resources to develop their cars to the fullest, and the 9-5 shows the results of brilliant design taken to its peak.

We have the 9-5 wagon, outfitted with the exceptional 3.0 litre V6 asymetrically turbocharged engine.  I truly believe that a person looking for a roomy, comfy, safe, practical, and fun family hauler couldn't do better for just about 40 grand.  SUVs have lots of utility, sure, but no sport, and the 9-5 manages to prove that even the most mundane driving tasks can be enjoyable.

Our Saab wagon has about 25,000 miles on it now, and it has been truly perfect.  In day-to-day driving, it's a joy.  The world's most PERFECT seats coddle you as you use that lag-free turbo engine to not only swiftly blend into traffic but also to blow the doors off punk kids in their Mustangs occasionally.  The car is ultra-smooth and handles like a much smaller, lighter vehicle.  As has been the case with all of our Saabs, this one is far from silent (you'll never mistake the 9-5 for a Lexus), but in this one the engine is the only sound we hear, and it's a nice, muffled growl.  Not at all displeasing to hear upon full acceleration.  

The Saab easily seats four in idyllic comfort; five is tighter but not by much.  The climate controls, stereo controls, and dashboard functions are all well laid-out.  I especially like the Night Panel feature, which darkens out all non-necessary instruments and functions at night to reduce glare on the driver.  We have the heated and cooled seats with memory, which are not only uber-comfy but also a true luxury in extreme temperatures (either hot or cold).  With the rear seat up, the Saab swallows a ton or stuff.  With it folded (it folds perfectly flat, and the headrests take care of themselves, so you don't have them rattling around back there), I could easily live back there if the need should arise.  Seriously, you'll be amazed at the spaciousness.  Combine this usability with 30 MPG on the highway and with a perfect reliability record, and you have the perfect (and fun) utility vehicle.

We looked at wagons from Audi (A6), Mercedes-Benz, BMW 5-series, and, of course, Saab's rival Volvo.  We could not be more pleased with the purchase.  I feel that, though the Bimmer is faster, it was so much smaller that it really shouldn't be in the same shopping class.  The others all offer all-wheel-drive, but with winter tires, traction control, and a Winter transmission mode, the 9-5 has handled over two feet of snow with nary a slip or a slide.  I personally feel that AWD is over-rated; it helps, but not enough to justify the added expense, reduced fuel efficiency, and heavier handling feel.  

The Saab 9-5 is a great car, and we recommend it highly!  It's wagon competition is not only not as well-balanced for all modes of life but is also more expensive, and once you drive one (sedan or wagon) you'll know why nothing compares.  Maybe Saab has finally made the perfect car with NO compromises!
