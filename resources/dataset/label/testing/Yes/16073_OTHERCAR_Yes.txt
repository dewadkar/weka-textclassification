            I am 29 years old, and I bought my first new car just last night. I had been looking at cars for a little over a year, trucks actually, but because baby seats and trucks don�t go together well, I narrowed the field to a Jeep Grand Charokee, Laredo. More specifically, a black, 4WD, v8, with power everything and a CD player. It was time for an adult car, something that a grown-up would drive, to replace my 16 year old mini truck that I have been driving since high school. 

So I researched what I wanted in 4WD options and engine size, by visiting the Jeep website (which is very useful by the way), and I figured out a price by looking at the kelly blue book site and www.carsdirect.com. I test drove the V8 and the straight 6, chose a color, and finally decided to buy THE MOST COMFORTABLE CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN.

Really, I have driven quite a few cars in my time, and I know what I like and what I hate in a car. For example, a Montero that I drove had such a short steering wheel column that when I moved the seat back to where it was comfortable for my legs, I couldn�t reach the steering wheel. My sister had a 4-Runner that I borrowed a few times last summer, and in that car, don�t expect your coffee to stay hot when you put it in the cup holder, because the air conditioning vents are positioned to blow cold air all over your cup. One last example, a Trooper that I drove on vacation last fall, you HAVE to take even slight corners extremely slow because it feels like you will tip over even going 10 miles an hour.

What I really like about the Jeep is the comfort. I drive up to 3 hours every day for my commute to work, and it feels like the seat was MADE for my butt. The radio controls are on the steering wheel, so easy to use and you don�t have to take your eyes off the road. The side view mirrors are huge so you wont miss the little Miata on your right side. It definitely does not drive like a truck, its not bouncy and it doesn�t beat you up like some trucks do. It has not been hard to get used to driving it, because it is not very wide, or long for that matter. Its quiet. Its roomy. I look really cute in it. Should I go on?
