            I love the handling of this truck.  My last vehicle was a car, so was concerned about the handling (I live in a large city and need to maneuver readily).  The tight steering radius makes cornering and parking a breeze.
Even with just the 6 cylinder engine, the power is there when needed for freeways, etc.  I opted for the extended cab with A/T.  The rear seat actually can seat full sized adults (6' and more -- I've tested that).  The under seat storage in rear seat is actually large enough to hold more than just the jack!  Oh, and as for ergonomic seats, this truck beats some luxury cars I've been in.  Weaknesses:  body integrity has historically been less than great, but no problems for me so far.  The truck bed is larger than that of it's competitors for '98, a full six foot bed.  Would I buy another Dodge Dakota?  You bet I would.  P.S.  I used to sell cars and trucks so I have a broad base to compare it to.<br><br>
