            Approximatly six months ago my wife's Sunbird started experiencing compression issues and severe braking problems. Needless to say, it was time for the old car to go. So, we took it on it's last drive down to a local used car lot, where my wife decided to get a nice emerald green Chevrolet Blazer with automatic transmission, AC, rear-mounted spare, AM/FM Radio with cassette, and power locks/windows.

The car has handled extremely well since we bought it, having driven in just about every form of weather with the exeception of hurricane and tornado (oh, and tsunami). In fact, the car is rugged enough that in a recent snow storm that occured up here in CT, the 4-wheel high drive was only needed once, and that was to break out of a patch of ice in the driveway. The car responds well to the accelerator and the brake, and has been relatively good on gas. The only immediate downside we found to the vehicle was a strange whistling noise that occured on the passenger side whenever we drove above 50 mph, but this was easily dismissed.

The downside to the car occured just the other week, when on our way home from an event, the windows suddenly fogged. Thinking it was just a problem with humidty and such, I dismissed it then, however, my wife did note for the past few days there had been a "fishy" scent inside the vehicle. So the next morning, I decided to take the car on a troubleshooting trip. At first, it seemed fine, but once the car started warming up, I noticed a fog/steam coming from the vents. Upon further investigation, I found the "fog" was vaporized anti-freeze and that the heater core had cracked! Evidently, this is an issue in this particular model and year of the Blazer, as other people I talked to have had this happen to them. Luckily, I had purchased the warranty with my car, and the car is due to be out of the shop by tonight.

This issue aside, the SUV has proven to be very reliable and easy to maintain, owing to the fact many parts are common and inexpensive. It has also preformed exceptionally well during off-road situations (I had a friend I needed to rescue who has pulled off the road on an off-ramp, so the shortest route was to drive up the opposite way on the shoulder/rough). It's large cargo / trunk space has proven handy in our grocery runs, and it has even proven comfortable enough to make our 4 hour drive to NH enjoyable.

The final word I have on this vehicle is it's an excellent choice for those who are looking for something that can be reliable and dependable, yet is used and in an affordable price range. However, if you purchase one from a dealer, be sure to opt for a warranty that will cover your drive-train (transmission, crank case, etc), as well as the radiator, heater core, and other essentials not usually covered, because unless the car has already had these fail, they will fail at this age.
