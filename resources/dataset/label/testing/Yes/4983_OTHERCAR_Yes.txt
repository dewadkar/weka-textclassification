            Are you tired of stopping to get gas every three or four days.  You won't have to if you are like me and own a Toyota Paseo.  Do you want to talk about excellent gas mileage?  My Paseo gets around 35 miles per gallon on the highway and around 25 miles per gallon in the city.  

I bought this used 1992 Paseo in September of 1998.  It already had 100,000 miles on it, which isn't much for a Toyota, but I haven't taken it to the shop for anything yet!  I am a traveling college student, and I travel alone most of the time.  This car is perfect for me.  There is a great deal of room in the trunk and back seat to travel with luggage.  Do not buy this car if you will be traveling with more than two people.  There isn't enough room to put people in the back seat.  Only luggage can fit back there.  Occasionally, when my friends ride in the back seat, their heads hit the back windshield when they get in.

The best story I can tell you to sum up what I think about the Paseo will really catch your attention.  I live in central Kentucky, and a friend and I drove from there to Orlando, Florida in December of 1998, which is almost 900 miles.  The gas tank was full when we started, but when we arrived at our destination, we had bought only $13.50 in gas!  So check out a Toyota Paseo next time you are car shopping. <br><br>
