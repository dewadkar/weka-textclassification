            Our 3 month old Z24 has been satifactory in all ways except we have had it in the dealership about 1/3 of the time we've owned it for a leak in the rear(trunk) area. After sitting out at night or being driven, it accumulates 1 to 2 inches of water in the spare tire area. The service dept has done everything, including taking it to a local body shop that deals on a large scale with leaks. The dealership has provided a loaner car when ours is tied up being diagnosed. This loaner is ok but not what we are making payments for. After 3 payments we still need a bilge pump to keep it flood free. A new 2000 car should not be inconveniencing the owner this much! I want a replacement(new 2000 Z24) and the head of the jerk who built this sieve!
	The vehicle is fun to drive, comfortable, and a good economical means of transportation for our  college age daughter.... when we actually have use of it.  This leak is not the dealer's fault. Chevrolet built it and should stand behind it. <br><br>
