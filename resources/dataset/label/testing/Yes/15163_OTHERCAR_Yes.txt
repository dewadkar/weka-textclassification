            Spent hours online and at local stores researching digital cameras and was pleased to conclude that the Toshiba PDR-M60 was the choice for me. Upon opening box found all necessary accessories to get immediately started. Plugged in the batteries and began shooting. Just remember to read the short instruction manual to begin immediately. When you get home be sure to read the CD-ROM manual. It's full of tips and tricks and really identifies all the options you have available. The best part was the automatic focus and and flash features. The LCD monitor can be left on or turned off to conserve power. The nice part is that even if the LCD monitor is off it gives you a two second preview of your last photo. If you don't like it, shoot it again. Turn the control knob, and in seconds view every photo on your SmartMedia card or view your pictures on the computer in seconds or your television screen instantly.

Weakness: Many profiles included complaints on battery life. However, I found that perhaps it's not totally the battery life that is the problem. On my particular camera, by just opening and closing the battery door, which is a little tricky to operate, seems to change the battery display back to full strength. This may be a flaw on all cameras or just this one. 

Recommendations: NiMH batteries w/charger, larger capacity 32mb or higher SmartMedia card, floppy disk adapter to take with you. 

Conclusion: All digital cameras have complaints so pick the camera that best fits your needs. Dont rely on just the opinions, pick one up and play with it. Remember if you hate it, most stores would gladly give you a refund. So buy one and have some fun.<br><br>
