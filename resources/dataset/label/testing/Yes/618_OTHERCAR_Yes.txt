            We purchased a 1996 Nissan sentra last year, and WE ARE IN LOVE!!  We needed a good running and reliable car and this is is.  We have not had any problems with the vehicle, even though we bought it from a Rental Car agency, you know how those cars are abused! The car gets great gas mileage(27 city, up to 35 Highway),handles great and we can laugh in the faces of all the monster trucks who can't fit into a parking space.  The trunk is roomy for this size car, and it handles well.  The only down side to this car is where the cup holders are located - too close to the radio, and that the engine could us a slight power boost.  This is an ideal choice for a small family on the go, who doesn't have much time for car maintenance. <br><br>
