            So you want to be different, right?  Well, commercials say if you want to be different, then try our product.  But, wait--if you're thinking that trying this product will make you different, aren't there thousands of other people out there with the same idea?  So, do you want to be different like them?  

I guess that is why I at first seriously considered buying a Saturn.  The commercials said that people who owned Saturns were a different breed.  I know I'm a different type of guy.  So, hey, it sounds like the car for me.  Had I fallen in the media's trap?  I had avoided it for so long, but now I felt pulled towards the Saturn dealer when it was time to get rid of my old car.  But I decided to go in with an unbiased opinion, and then check out all the other car dealerships as well.  I didn't have to.  The Saturn SC2 was my kind of car.

It was built with me in mind.  I promise.  They KNOW me.  They had to.  While I was sleeping, they measured my body and scanned my mind.  The car I found in the lot was the epitome of my idea of the perfect car.

It was slightly used (less than 20,000 road miles).  Not a scratch could I find on its surface.  The interior was spotless, the engine looked so clean I thought it couldn't have ever been cranked (just pulled for 20K, perhaps?).  

It had a sunroof.  It was manual shift (I hate automatics).  CD player, great sound system, FIVE cup holders (two convertible between ashtrays and holders), dual airbags, peppy get up, stylish looks, and this great deep green color that at times looks black, but you look again and see sparkles of dark foresty colors.  I loved it.

In January of 2000, I will have had it for a year.  It drives beautifully, and there is only one annoying little rattle that you can only hear when the radio is off. It's still in great shape even though up until two months ago I commuted over 2 hours a day!

The only other bad things I can think of are that for some people it might be a bit small.  My 6-3 friend doesn't have a problem in it, though, and he's fairly stocky.  And the seatbelts don't always roll back in when you release them.  That's annoying.  

Overall though, this has been the best car I have ever had.  I plan to get a Saturn as my next car--but I think that will be a LONG way off since this one seems to have what I need for the next several years.<br><br>
