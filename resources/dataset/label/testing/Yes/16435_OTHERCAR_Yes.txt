            I've recently turned 18 and this camera was my "big present" for this year.  I had it out of the box and clicking in about 4 seconds.  So for all you perspective buyers, it is very easy to use.

I suggest changing the file naming process from renew (why the default is this I will never know) to cont so your pics don't end up being numbered the same.

After quickly filling the included 8MB SmartMedia Card (the default picture quality is also high, I hadn't changed it) I ran for the box to learn how to upload the pics.  

ALAS!! The only included interface is a USB cable (terrific if you have one) but my comp being borderline garbage (i'm not typing on it now, it can't handle the net.) has no USB ports. 

Solution 1:
I ran to my friends house.  He has USB ports.  Put the CD in and get going only to find it won't work with windows 95.

Solution 2:
I run to another friends house and get it going.  He has Win 98 and USB but a slow processor.  Alas again, his comp hangs when trying to upload the media.

Solution 3.
Local library (where I am now) has new comps (donated by Bill Gates no less) I load the CD only to find that you need to be logged in as an administrator (running windows NT) Luckily I've worked there for 3 years and get the admin password, load the media and get it working.  

TRIUMPH!! The pics are amazing.  High quality, great colors everything.  What a great camera!!!

Moral of the Story.  Find out how you are going to get the pics off the camera before you buy it.  I know I could have bought the 3.5" adaptor to solve all my problems but I have no $$$ so what am I going to do???

Note:  The camera tells you that some shots may not turn out all that well as the light is poor.  I suggest getting a small tripod to keep it steady.

Thanks for your time and good shooting!
