              The 1992 Cadillac El Dorado.  The fusion of sleek chick magnetizing design, and fusion of high price repair bills.  This car has brought me a lot of attention, but it has also brought me plenty of heartache and trouble. 
  When I saw this car at the car lot I had to have it, although it was used, it had 100,00 + miles on it, which meant that the previous driver also loved it.  From its sleek design to its molded comfortable leather interior, this car has brought me happiness.  Somewhat.  
  I've had this car since December of '99, and already I spent over 3,000$ on repairs.  Now that's a lot considering I only make 9 dollars an hour.  Hell, the car only costed 8 thousand dollars.  I guess that's what I get for buying it used.
  Then again this car has it all cd/cass player, Bose Gold Series speakers, leather everything, authentic wood trim, keyless door locks, power seats, lumbar support seats, i could keep on going but that would be selfish.  
  If ever it is said that you cant find happiness in material possessions you need to ride in a Cadillac.  its true comforting bliss.  plus all the attention you get driving a phat ride will definetly help raise a persons low self-esteem.  it has for me.
  Although the new El Dorado is a bit pricy, if your a Corporate Executive buy one. If your not, but you want a fancy car, either buy it used, or buy a Corvette.  <br><br>
