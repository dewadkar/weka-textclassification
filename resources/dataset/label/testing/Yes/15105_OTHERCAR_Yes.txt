            After owning an Altima GXE from 1993 to 1996, then moving on to a Pathfinder, the next choice was definitely an Altima once again.  The newly redesigned and engineered Altima has more horse-power than ever before and is especially noticeable with the automatic transmission.  We opted for the new Altima Sport Edition (SE) for the sportier look and the power.  Handling is much tighter than in the previous design and road noise has been diminished, but still there.  The Altima easily accelerates to high speeds comfortably, and with great handling.  As with any sportier car, you will notice more torque power with the 5 speed manual transmission than with the automatic.  Overall, this new design and engineering has really impressed us with such a low price tag, ranging closely with some of the GXE's out there, and the GLE.  
The SE comes with the sport package which includes CD and cassette player, titanium tinted alloy wheels, floor mats, spoiler, fog lamps, just to name a few.  We are extremely pleased with the Altima, and with the winter months here, I'm sure it will handle as well as the '94 model did in the snow.  <br><br>
