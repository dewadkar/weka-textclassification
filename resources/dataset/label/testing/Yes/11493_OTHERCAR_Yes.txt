            Where do I begin?  I love this car.   The smooth grain leather seats that you melt into.  The giddy-up that pushes you back into the seats at a force of 100 G's.  The way the tires grip the road as you take a sharp turn.  The safety of anti-lock brakes and a larger safety cage chassis.

I've spent at least 30 hours riding in my grandparents Buick Park Avenue riding back on forth from all of my high school football games.  They went to every trip and I made sure to get a note from my parents to ride back in my grandparents comfy seats.  Sort of beats a hard bus ride home for 2.5 hours, don't ya think?  

I was lucky enough to drive the car a year ago on a trip that I took.  Believe me, I hated to hand the keys over to grandpa's old hands when I got home.  

I was absolutely shocked at the comfort of this car.  It has features that I will never be able to do without again.  I liked several features so much that I don't think that anybody should get a Park Avenue without the small &quot;upgrades.&quot;  
1.  The ULTRA package, which adds a few horsies under the hood and makes the car a mean road handlin machine.
2.  The feature (not sure of the name) that shows puts the speedometer on the windshield of the driver's side, so the driver doesn't have to look down at the speedometer all the time, which allows the driver to keep his/her eyes on the road, which leads to fewer accidents.  A great feature!
3.  Dual climate control.  I am so warm blooded that it has to be about 60 degrees when I drive so I don't fall asleep.  My girlfriend is always freezing and she likes it about 85 degrees.  We can have it both ways in the Park Avenue, which made travelling much easier for both of us.
4.  Full grain leather seats.  These were the most comfortable car seats that I have ever ridden in.  The seat felt as if it were made specifically to fit my body.  I loved it.  The top-notch smooth ride helped add to the comfort also

5.  This is a very important point.  The Buick Park Avenue is a luxury car for about half the price of many luxury cars on the market.  I've never ridden in a Mercedz-Benz or a Rolls Royce, but I don't know how much more comfortable a car could become.

A Park Avenue will be the first car that I buy when I have enough money.  It will be my travel car if I have enough money to purchase a few cars.
