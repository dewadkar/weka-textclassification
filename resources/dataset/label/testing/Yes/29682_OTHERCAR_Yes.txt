            Many people aren't familiar with the Eagle Talon, and I'm proud to say that I owned a 1990 Eagle Talon Tsi.  This car was Chrysler's offshoot of the Eclipse.  Except I believe that this car was much more fun to drive (in a manual shift) and even a little faster.  

The Talon comes equipped with a 2.0 Liter turbo four cylinder.  This rice-burner packs about 200 ponies stock - but she only weighs 3,500 pounds!  Capable of doing about 15.0 secs. in the quarter mile.  Not bad if you ask me.  

Aside from the power of the Talon, this car is relatively comfortable. The Talon wasn't made for four passengers, but for two, she's great.  It comes standard with bucket seats which I like because they cradle your body to reduce movement while driving.  The all-wheel-drive Talons give you spectacular grip on the road, even in wet conditions!  

As far as the maintenence goes:  I owned the car for about a year and only had to do normal maintenence.  (oil changes)  The car's engine was in immaculate condition - even though it was 9 years old when I bought it.  

I believe many people under-rated the Talon because they didn't know much about it, nor did Chrysler do much advertising for the Talon.  If you've never drove a Talon, it may be too late since they stopped production some years back - I think 1997.  If you do get the chance, drive one, you'll be surprised.
