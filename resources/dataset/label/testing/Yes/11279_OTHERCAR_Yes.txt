            I bought a 2000 Forester "L" at the end of August 1999. I had looked long and hard at many other cars and SUVs. When I took the Forester out for a test drive I knew that this was the vehicle for me. You see, I have had seven major operations on me spine and was looking for something that gave me comfort, cargo space and a little something extra in the engine. The Forester provided all of that and more. One of the things I really like about the vehicle, is that there are all kinds of "cubby holes" to store things, like sunglasses, tapes etc. Everything is located so you don't have to reach across the car to find it. The ride is wonderful and the handling is among the best I felt in a long time. In fact the ride is so smooth that I have found myself doing 75 and 80 without even feeling like I was speeding. All I can say is Thank God for cruise control otherwise I'd be paying for speeding tickets. Anyone who wants a vehicle with enclosed cargo space and does not want to get into a van or large SUV should take a serious look at the Forester. Like the commerical for the Forester says, "A SUV that drives like a car"
I just want to add a few notes to this review. A couple of very serious things have happened in my life since I originally wrote the first part of this review. I am now confined to a wheelchair due to some severe nerve damage in my spine. Walking is out of the question. So this means a place to put the chair is required. Well, guess what? It fits in the rear of the car with room to spare. Granted you cannot stand the chair up but it lies down quite nicely, without having to fold down the rear seats! There is also room to carry a few things and if you're not too overly concerned about placing things on top of the chair there is plenty of room to do that too. I hope that none of you ever end up like me, but just know that the Forester will be there to help you out and keep you mobile, which after all is what we buy our cars for, right? Take care and enjoy you car.
