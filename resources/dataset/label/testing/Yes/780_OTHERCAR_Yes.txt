            When I first saw that Jaguar XJ 6, it was love at first sight.  When I was little I dreamed of having a Jaguar. I thought it was best looking car and even then, I knew there was something about this type of car that made me feel good just looking at it.  So when I saw J.R in the lot he called to me.  I just had to get him.  I had a Pontiac Grand Am and immediately traded it for J.R.  I have heard a lot of things about Jaguars being temperamental and cold.  Mine has not been that, of course like a lot of older cars, some things need to be replaced and keeping your car tuned and all that mechanical stuff makes them run better, so J.R has been taken care of and he takes care of me. My Jaguar is a 1986, as far a I know at the beginning of that year 2 versions of that car were built, the difference is in the carburetor, and wiring.  The wiring in those cars are not the best, but with proper handling and care they will last.<br><br>
