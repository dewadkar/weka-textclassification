            I purchased a 1996 Limited Grand Cherokee with 34k miles in 1998.  The vehicle was purchased off lease, which I was skeptical of, but the car turned out to be in great condition overall.

I would first of all recommend that anyone spending this
amount of money on an SUV should go for the Limited model. The Laredo has a very cheap feel to it, especially the interior panels.  The limited boasts plush leather seats, sunroof, home-link (to program for your garage doors), information module, and infinity sound system.  This will make any commute much more enjoyable!

The interior is very comfortable, and provides adequate headroom for anyone over 6 feet.  The materials that are used in this vehicle are high quality, as after 7 years they still are in good condition.

The 4.0 liter Six Cylinder is plenty of power for this vehicle.  The 5.2 liter V8 will bring you to the gas pump more often and does not deliver significant performance advantage (unless you plan on towing with the vehicle).

Speaking of which, I would not recommend a 4x4 vehicle if you do not plan on driving off-road or if your area has mild weather.  The 4x4 is more costly to run, and experiences greater mechanical failure, and any extended warranty increases significantly.

The only major mechanical problem was a leak in the differential, causing it to go out.  Since it was within 36,000 miles, it was replaced under warranty.

I am amazed at how the vehicle still performs at 7 years old.  While other vehicles look outdated on the road, this SUV still retains it's classic style.
