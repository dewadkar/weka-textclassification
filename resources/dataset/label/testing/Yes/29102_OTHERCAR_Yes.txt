            I own a 1999 PreRunner ExtendCab. From the day I brought it home, I've loved it.
I've owned it for 4 years, and I have 37,000 miles on it.
It's a great looking truck, and I get asked about it whenever I fill up.
The fit and finish is perfect. The inside is well thought out, and there's plenty of front passenger room. Even the rear jump seats are well designed. Rear passengers have shoulder belts. There's more rear room in a Ford ExtendCab, but the Toyota is not a full size truck!
The PreRunner rides a bit rough, as it was designed to do. The PreRunner is supposed to simulate the ride of the 4x4, and that it does. It has the same suspension. It sits high and I like the visibility up there.
The 190 horses provide plenty of power, maybe a little too much for a pickup with a light rear end. Hit the gas too much at a stop light and you'll be leaving rubber. The engine is smooth and very responsive.
Gas mileage in town is about 16, and about 20 on the highway. That's not too bad for a big truck. Changing the oil filter is fairly difficult, but it can be done. The skid plate has to come off before the oil filter can be reached. I bought a few long rachet extensions, and I can loosen the oil filter from the driver's front wheel well. I wish my truck had power side view mirrors. I would have gladly paid for that option.
A word of caution. I had a water leak in 2001 and took it into the dealer. The service advisor said that the water pump was leaking and was a common problem with the PreRunner. While they had the water pump out, they noticed an oil leak coming from the head gasket, and fixed that also, all under warranty. The head gasket was leaking in a location that couldn't be seen unless the water pump was removed, so I was "lucky" to have had the water pump fail!
The PreRunner is pricey. My truck, in 1999, had a MSRP of $23,000. A friend bought an identical 2000 model, and it had a price drop of about $2,000. The Toyota Fleet Manager confirmed the price reduction.
Toyota has been the class in its field for a long time, and the PreRunner should be no exception. I recommend it highly to those who don't mind a little rougher ride.
