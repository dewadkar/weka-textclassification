            Hey Ransy... I own a 94 Model, Im 6' and 160 and I used to drive this car 125 miles to work and back each day... and I found it to be one of the most comfortable cars for the ride and sports features.  I have also driven long distances 5 hours plus and find I am not the least bit tired or cramped.  (Did you try sliding the seat back and reclining it a bit???!) 

I find the car is excellent for highway driving where you can overtake with ease in 5th or 4th gear and have the car in speeds of 100+ in no time.  The handling above 100 is very quiet and smooth as well as feeling safe.  The acceleration from 0 may not be the best. butI can still get to 60 in under 7 seconds - but the power comes in handy when car is already moving in my opinion.  Its also great for getting people to move automatically when they see you in their mirrors. 

I have driven this car and typically do 90-110 even though I have had tickets. It doesnt stop me, because I drive any car to it ability, and this car is very able to go these speeds and higher in a very safe manner. 

I have found very easily being able to take ramp speeds marked at 30mph in excess of 60mph very easily.  I have driven other cars claiming to have superior road handling and have found not to be the case. The only problem I have had is in the wet when I experienced some slippage - but then most cars will. (BTW, I dont have the 4wd version)

Ransy - Its funny how you say &quot;if you get into a high speed accident, it wont be good&quot; and then at the same time say that you swapped with your daughter and took her impact-bar protected Volvo!!!  Give a young girl a fast car that you yourself find fast and unsafe.. yeah - thats good thinking...<br><br>
