            I have the 2000 Elantra GLS wagon. I bought it new in 2000. I found the shape especially appealing. And the cargo room was a big plus. At around $14,000, I couldn't believe all I was getting. the car is loaded. Power windows, locks. AM/FM cassette (I switched to a CD player later). Cruise control and alarm. The car rides smoothly. And the engine provides plenty of pep. Gas mileage isn't the best, expect low 20's in normal everyday driving and little better on highway driving. My only gripes are as follows: There just isn't enough front legroom for the driver. I am 6' tall and I find the track for the front driver's seat does not go back far enough. This can make things uncomfortable for long drives. Also, The center armrest/console is too low and too small. Hyundai needs to provide a larger armrest with larger storage capacity in the console. The car has been trouble-free except for a few minor glitches (had to have a rear power window fixed and also had to have a pan/gasket replaced). Lastly, you just can't beat Hyundai's terrific warranty!
