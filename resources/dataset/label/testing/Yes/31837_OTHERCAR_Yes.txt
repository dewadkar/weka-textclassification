               We recently purchased a 2000 Honda Civic, our 4th Honda (I guess you could call us &quot;Honda junkies&quot;)and we were pleasantly surprised. We were downsizing from a 97 Honda CRV, which we loved but could no longer afford.With 2 small children still in carseats, I was  so afraid that the Civic was just going to be too small. But this is not the case. It is in fact roomier than it appears from the outside. I am able to fit 2 large carseats in the back, as well as a double stroller plus my groceries in the trunk. I think I have as much trunk space as I did in the CRV. 
   The main reason we keep driving a Honda is the reliability. We have always leased our cars and now have decided to purchase this one. We plan to keep it for 10-15 years and we fully expect it to make it that long. I know so many people that have older Honda's that have had few or no problems with them, even after 10+ years. The Honda name has become synonymous with quality and reliability and it is a company I feel I can trust.
