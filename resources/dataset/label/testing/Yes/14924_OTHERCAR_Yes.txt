            I fell in love with this digital camera at once.

The first obvious advantage is that the pictures are
stored on a floppy disk (and we all have thousands of those)
and these are totally re-usable. You can't recycle regular film, can you???

Then the great ease of use. You can make still photos or movies lasting up to 1 minute. Yes, a 1-minute movie fits
on one floppy.

You have immediate access to the disk whilst it still is
in the camera, so you can look at and delete pictures at once.

Then you just take out the floppy and load the pictures into your PC. And stick the erased floppy back in the camera.

I have purchased a photo printer too, so the film developing
rip-offs can go jump in a lake for all I care.

Some photo-purists tell me that digital pictures will never be as "good" as regular pictures, but I don't think so.
The quality is great. Really.
