            I bought my Escort SE at the end of the 1999 model year.  My previous two vehicles were Fords and I have always gotten my money's worth!  My last 2 cars had 177,000 and 184,000 miles respectively and had no major repairs!

I love the pre-packaged options that came with the car, especially the CD player.  The trunk is roomy and it is very quiet for a car of it's size.  The 5-speed manual is a hoot to drive and I like the gas mileage.

The only thing I dislike about my car is a few things that were not right with it - horn didn't work, left rear passenger side seatbelt retracts too tightly.

The car is fairly zippy and roomy enough for road trips.  The 5-speed can be a drag in stop and start traffic, but the clutch was easy to break in.

Anyone looking for a compact that is fun to drive with dependability and lots of options for the buck should check out their local Ford dealer.

And Ford, see you again for my next car purchase!<br><br>
