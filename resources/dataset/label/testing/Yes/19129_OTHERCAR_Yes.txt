            I've had this car for quite some time now and have loved every bit of it. Who says nice German cars cost too much money?
I wanted something different from the crowd of Japanese cars out there. Looks wise it is a winner but that is not the only reason. You must check out the attention to detail in the interior - both the front seats have airbags, lumbar adjustments and height adjustments. Too often such privileges are reserved only for the driver seat. Both the front windows are one-touch-up/one-touch-down (most other cars just have one-touch-down)and feature what VW calls pinch-protection - if the glass encounters a finger (or neck!) on its way up it automatically stops and reverses. The chrome plate for the gear looks very elegant. Also note how the handles above the doors will slowly recess back when you leave them - its very cool to watch :-) Plus all the controls are back-lighted at night so you dont have to grope around - even the door controls for the rear seat. Now that I haven't seen in Camrys or Accords. The blue lighting for the instrument panel and the red needles really sold me. And for some reason there is an AC vent in the glovebox - I haven't tried storing chocolates there but its good to show people...You can also open all the windows without entering the car by using the key - pretty neat capability eh? Even the key to the car smacks of high quality - its the same as the Audi. You even have a valet key though I'm not that rich to use it!

This is the only car in this price range which offers you Tiptronic option. My favorite place to use it is when I'm first at a traffic light - it feels awesome to floor the pedal and speed away. The engine is the same as Audi A4 - 1.8l but turbocharged and feels very smooth. The car handling is very precise and I like to push it especially on sharp turns. The seats are comfortable after adjustments - I've driven for 3-4 hrs at a stretch. In normal driving it has a kind of a low gentle roar when you drive at midrange rpms. The trunk has enormous room and the circular roof of the car offers a lot of headroom. And with the 6CD changer and premium sound system it positively rocks!!

I intended to buy a sports car (being young and what not) but who cares if its a sports car or a nice looking sedan as long as its fun to drive!

I've gone through two oil changes and have had no problems. The car handles great, no rattles, nothing. I've made two long trips (&gt;1000miles) without any problems. There is enough room in the backseat for someone to play the guitar. And the trunk can hold lots of stuff.

Update:[5th Jan 2000, 22months]
Another free oil change and another 2000+ mile trip without any problems. Some comments from friends who have been driving - &quot;great acceleration&quot; (going from 80-&gt;120 left a Taurus in the dust) &quot;very smooth&quot;, etc.
