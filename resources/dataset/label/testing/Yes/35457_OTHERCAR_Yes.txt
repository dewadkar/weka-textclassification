            First off, I have been into photography for several decades, starting in High School. I am not a professional, but I have always loved to push the envelope in my photos. I purchased a lower end digital camera a couple of years ago and have managed to take decent shots, but when it came time to take more than a point and click shot, I always pulled out the 35 mm. But no more! 

I love to play with light and color and have taken a number of unusual shots over the years. I looked at a number of digital cameras when I decided to upgrade to a higher end model. The Sony DSC-F707 had everything I was looking for and then some. 

Every digital camera I tested had "point and shoot" capabilities. However, I also wanted fully automatic functions as well. This camera has both and everything in between. I can select fully auto, automatic shutter - manual aperture, automatic aperture, manual shutter or fully manual. In addition, the 3 shot burst is great for capturing action shots. 

The pop up flash is always available, recharges reasonably fast and has the double flash option to eliminate red eye. There is a screen built into the back of the body and the lens rotates, allowing you to actually hold the camera above your head and aim. Like most cameras, you can preview your shots and delete any you don't want. The best advice is to purchase a 128 MB memory stick and keep the tiny 16 MB one in the case you will have to buy (it does not come with a case). 

This camera also is capable of taking short AVI movies, but since I have a Sony digital camcorder, I doubt I will use that option. By the way, the charger (yes, the batteries are rechargeable only) is the same one used for the Sony Digital camcorder, so I need only pack one for vacations. 

In my opinion, the quality of photos I am able to take with this camera are better than the ones I take with my 35 MM. One reason is that I can take far more shots and delete the ones I don't like. It is far cheaper to take 24 shots with this camera to get one you like than with a 35 mm!
