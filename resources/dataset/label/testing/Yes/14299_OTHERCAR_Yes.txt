            Let me start by giving you 30 seconds on my history, so you can put the review in context. I've owned small sporty cars (Firefly Turbo), sports cars (RX-7), and now that I'm in my mid-30s, married, with 1 kid, a '97 Ford Taurus LX (w/ 200HP Duratec). I wanted to buy a new car before the Taurus warranty ran out... 3 transmissions will make you feel that way. My constraints were: reliable (!), quick, 4 doors, and preferably smaller than the Taurus (easy to park, better mpg!).

Reliability: The Sentra was redone in 1995 and the quality was vastly improved over earlier models. It was redone again in 2000 and not only was excellent quality, but wasn't the plainest looking car on the street. Here in Canada a popular and influencial car-guide book has rated the Sentra 5 stars for quality. Having bought my wife a 2001 Cavalier, I can attest to the difference in quality (not really knocking the Cav, ya get what ya pay for). Fit and finish inside is good, and nothing screams cheap.

Quick: The Spec V is very quick. It'll match the RSX on the skidpad, and beat the WRX through the slalom (though not 0-60!). You've essentially got the Altima engine strapped to a Maxima 6-speed transmission. With $500 in bolt on parts you can add another 20HP and give chase to cars costing many $$$s more. The 17" rims and Continental 215/45 tires give great hold, but don't even think about driving them in the winter. Add $1000 for new tires if you get snow near you.

4 doors: It seems when car makers decide to have any kind of power in the car, they either limit the car to 2 doors or jack the price by $20,000. Meaning, I am not aware of any other car near the Sentra's price that has 4 doors and the same power. Not the Corolla, Civic, Cav, or Elantra. To get that power with 4 doors, you're up in BMW 320 or WRX territory. Ca' ching!

Size: Is it me, or are compact cars getting bigger? The Corolla is stretching, and certainly the Sentra is bigger than I remember it. You can get four 200lb 6' men in the car without anyone feeling crowded. The back seat folds down so you can slip a 2x4 easily through. Note though, the sub-woofer takes up the '40' part in the 60/40 split.

I'll cover now some of the more 'contentious' issues:

Non-Spec V SE-R: Quite honestly, the difference in performance between the Spec V and the regular SE-R is nominal, if any. I went with the Spec V because the seats were more comfortable (to me) and I wanted the better wheels. That said, drive the regular SE-R before you buy. The money you save on a base SE-R and a loaded Spec V can buy a lot of add-ons... or very nice projection screen TV :)
The other factor is the 6-speed. After driving it for a while, I can say that 6 gears makes a lot of sense in a car like a Ferrari, but not so much in a Sentra. You are *constantly* shifting because the gearing is so close. If you like to drink coffee when you drive to work through the city, get the SE-R with the 5 speed.

Those Seats!: Yep, they are red all right. You like them, or hate them. No in between. I happen to like them. If I do grow sick of them, for about $1500 CAD I can change it all to grey leather.

Rockford Stereo: This stereo seems to get slammed a lot by reviewers, and I think I know why. Many people really into car stereos tend to be in their 20's. In addition they *generally* like their music loud and with a lot of car- shaking bass. The Rockford system is not for you if you like music like this... it's simply not designed for it. It is an excellent system for people who don't turn their stereo up more than half way, and like music that emphasises midrange and highs. Classic, folk, and country will do very well with this. It's the best stock system I've heard.

Bothersomes: A few things always bother me in a car... the Sentra is no different:
a) ignition must be 'on' to raise windows/close sunroof
b) no easy place to hold CD cases. The dash storage area is too small and hot, and the armrest compartment is really ackward to get at.
c) first gear is good to about 12 miles an hour. Useless!
d) should come with a deal on another set of tires for winter
e) if you overrev the engine it doesn't sound a buzzer (like my RX-7), but rather you get a very disturbing pulsing of the engine... enough to make you wonder if you've just smoked the engine (I was dumb enough to pass a RV from about 60km/h to 90km/h in 3rd).

So in summary, the SE-R is an excellent mix of sport, practicality, and value. The Spec V add some bells and whistles; it's up to you to determine if they are worth it.
