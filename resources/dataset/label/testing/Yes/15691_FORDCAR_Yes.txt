            My grandfather has owned 4 S10's and 2 F-150's in my lifetime. The first S10 was wrecked and totaled. The 2nd S10 blew a motor. The 3rd S10 lost a clutch. The 4th S10 just wasn't big enough. Then he got the first F-150, it was a blue, 1993, 5 speed. He owned this truck for four years, in which he never had a single complaint about it. The only thing he ever had to replace was the headlights because some water had got down in them somehow. This truck was in the same condition as the day i bought it when he got rid of it. The only reason he got rid of it was the 2nd F-150 was a red, 1996, automatic. This is the truck he is driving as of today. In the 4 years he has owned this truck the only thing he has had to have replace was the tailgate hinge, because I backed into the trash dumpster with the tailgate down.

Now this brings me to my title, King of the road. In my whole life I have only heard 1 person comlain about their F-150. That was when my cousin went through a 40 yard section of 2 feet deep mud in 6.7 sec. He said he could have did better, none the less he won anyway. Not only did he win that week at the mud bog but every week for the last month. He drives a stock 4x4 F150. but he runs in the superstock class. Now after all of those facts how can u not view the F-150 as King of the road.<br><br>
