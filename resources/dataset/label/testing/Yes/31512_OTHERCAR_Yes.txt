            I first noticed the 2000 Sentra on a Nissan tv add. I really like the way that Nissan styled this car. I went to a dealer right away and test drove a Sentra GXE. It really has a peppy engine. I was surprised by how well the car rode. I went from A midsize american car to this Sentra and was not disappointed a bit with the ride. I got A GXE with the 180 watt sound system and really think that it does a good job. I will not be putting a different radio in this car. I got the convenience package and the luxury package in my sentra. It has a lot of nice extras. like the sunglass holder and the back cupholders. I also love the alarm system. The only thing that i did not get with this car is anti-lock brakes. with all of the options that i got i would have thought that anti-lock brakes would be part of a package. my only complaint about my car is that the brake pedal has a spongy feel. It may be because of no anti-lock brakes. (which my pontiac had standard). oh and 1 more thing that i thought almost funny. my car with all of the options came to almost $17,000 and i had to pay $8 for a cigarette lighter. lol it is an option. The car is a joy to drive it corners great. it gets decent mileage. It has nice passing power and i bought a lovely red color which make people turn around and look. Anyone who would like a peppy great looking car which also gets great mileage should buy this car.<br><br>
