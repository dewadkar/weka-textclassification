            This review applies to all years of the latest 5-series model.  That represents years '96 and up if I'm not mistaken.

I have a review of the 7-series BMW, and pretty much all my thoughts apply to this model line.  However, there are a few superlatives the 5-series earns over even the mighty 7, although, that also holds true vice versa.  Let me explain.

Sytling:

Exterior:  Talk about a successful design.  It flows REALLY well, it always introduces new thoughts about the shape from the different angles and colors you see it in the next day, and is certainly classy.  The front, rear, and sideviews all excel, never being repulsive in any way to anyone, in any age group.  The 540i looks absolutely fabulous with thost gorgeous 18-inch wheels.  Truly a great design, and while some might say the exterior design is bland, outfitting your car with nice wheels really accentuates your visibility, if you know what I mean.  The designers obviously spent serious time refining the design (visually) of the 5-series.  So much thought must have gone into the design to make everything of proper proportions, ratios, and smooth flowing.  I especially like the rear tailights.  Very mature, classy, and hi-tech looking all at the same time.

Interior:  Ok, I've said this before, and I'll say it again.  The 5 and 7 series BMWs have arguably the most appealing interiors ever.  Simply gorgeous I think.  I really do.  Fabulous textures (nevermind the 4 kinds of leather you can choose), flowing lines, and color choices.  Excellent, rich, deep, hi-quality wood in abundance, and while not the easiest to use, very neatly-designed (at least visually) controls on the dash.  Most of the steering wheels you can choose from are very pleasing to the eye (nevermind to use!  More on that later!).  I especially like the 5's in tan leather.  Just brings out extra richness.  You feel very content in these cars.  Now there's the M5, with 2-tone leather colorings and a whole buncha stuff you can customize...that cannot be beat.  I really think the 5-series (and 7, since they are so close in design/look/feel) have the best interiors of all mainstreams cars out there.

Comfort: The 5s, like the 7s, come with optional BMW &quot;comfort seats&quot;.  These are 16-way power, and are regarded as the *BEST* seats ever made for a car, regardless of price, period.  Try 'em, and believe.  Wow.  Where else can you find a splitting backrest?  Yes!  Like close to the middle of your back you can tilt the top half of the backrest close to 30 degrees or so!  Yes, right now they don't offer massage like the new Merecedes S-class does, but everything else you could possibly want is there.  Then you can choose from several leather choices, Montana, buffalo, etc. (actually in the USA you don't have as much selection as you do overseas, including the options overall, but we won't go into that). Spaciousness up front is ver adequate, even for me at 6'3.  In the back, yes, 3 will be tight, if not children, but for 2, very comfy and spacious enough.  Just to see, I positioned the driver's seat how I drive, and then got in the back; My knees didn't touch the front seat (although it was within an inch or two).  Yes the 7-series is limousine-like, but more on that later...

Engineering:  From the fabulous engines (now the 528 has double-vanos which is variable-valve timing (camshaft profile manipulation) on both the intake and exhaust cams, so you should notice a better spread of torque), to the awesome suspension, to the super-stiff chassis, to the fantastic attention to driver and passenger safety, truly world-class.  If you read my review of the '99 BMW 328, you'll know what I mean, and THEN SOME!  The 5-series owners easily have the bragging-rights to technological engineering.  Even more so as of '99 onwards.

Drive:  So you like the looks of luxo cars X, Y, and Z eh?  You prefer cars A and B for their extra spaciousness in the back?  You prefer to pay a lot less for cars C and D?  Honestly?  If you really ARE honest in those remarks, and haven't tried driving a 5-series, do yourself a favor and try it.  We'll see how you change your outlook on luxury cars.

Ladies and Gentlemen, the 5-series is the ultimate sedan.  You can get either a 5-spd auto (excellent, and now offers +/- steptronic shifting) or a 5/6-spd manual transmission, depending on whether the car in question is a 528i or a 540i/M5 (in Europe by the way, the 520, 530 (diesel), and 523 are offered).  There are few shifters out there better than the ones BMW offers.  Engines?  Simply sublime.  Ask anyone if you heven't tried.  Now you can get double-pane glass for the side windows.  Lexus products ain't much quiter on the road.  HANDLING?!  Words are not enough.  The steering feel is so incredible, the suspension so compliant (ok, how the heck does BMW manage to integrate smoothness and bump compliance with such extreme levels of performance?!).  Take turns at high speeds in a 5-series and then take them in the Japanese or American competitors.  No contest, not even close!  The 5-series have the same suspension setup at the 7-series, but it's all-aluminum, actually a first for the industry on a luxury car of this calibre.  The brakes are more than you could want, unless you're Schumacher on the track (uhm, actually the 540i and M5 will hold up pretty well).  

Back to the steering...ok, it's just so good I need to write more about it.  It's of the recirculating-ball type in the 540i, and of the rack-and-pinion variety on the 528 (and M5 I think).  There are those whom have said that a 528i's steering feels better (more feedback to you) than a 540i's, and yes, R&amp;P does favor sensitivity over isolation, unlike the RB design usually found in luxo cars.  Not sure why the V8-equipped 540 got that, but it's fabulous in that, and even better in the 528i (rated by many publications in Europe as the &quot;best car in the world&quot; overall, I wanna pretty much say I agree).  You know in the new 328i, the feeling should have been the same as in the 528i, but for some reason I felt it being oh so-slightly less as impressive.  Perhaps it's the suspension design, I don't know, but in general the steering, and what it allows you to feel, it fabulous in pretty much any Bimmer.

I need not tell you about the engines.  There really aren't enough words in the English language to describe the power delivery of any of these engines (2.8L In-line 6, 4.4L V8, 5.0L V8, and soon to replace the 2.8 the 3.0L in-line 6).  Smoother than anything short of a German V12, extremely efficient power delivery to the wheels, great sounds, fantastic usablity (torque EVERYWHERE)...I really can say with confidence that BMW, for their ENTIRE range, makes the best engines in the world.  Good news for you auto-only people, they say the new 3.0L (i.e. 530i of 2002 and above) matches the automatic better than the 2.8L does.  

While we're at it, BMW offers 2 automatics: a regular 5-spd auto, and a sport-tronic one which only has P-R-N-D but the shifter at the D position can shift to the side for +/- gear changing controlled (mostly) by you.  Works quite well.  The only thing I don't like is that it downshifts as sees fit (like if you're in 4th going 25mph then stomp on the gas, it shifts to 2nd or 1st by itself).  However, it DOES hold a gear while the revs are high for superior control of power in a turn, for example.

You can drive this car like an insane wacko and it never lets you down.  The 7-series may look classier, and have substantially more room, but the 5-series is more nimble because of its smaller size, and the fabulous suspension (unbelievable, the best there is) is even BETTER cuz it's all-aluminum on the 5s!!!  Plus it's easier to slip in and around town and park for you urban dwellers.

Ok, so besides all this, the trunk isn't huge, but damn good enough, with the fold-down seats, if so equipped.  And these days, you can get the navigation system (actually not that great; The Japanese offerings are better, IMHO).  Oh, did I mention the fabulous 12-speaker, 4 subwoofer sound system (not sure it's offered for he 528)?  440W.  DSP included.  Enuf said?  In the 7, the system is 14 speakers.  Couldn't tell the difference personally.  Maybe with some more music.  :)

Speaking of music, you must experience the V8 of the 540i.  Absolutely wonderful.  Sounds (and feels) so refined and powerful.  This is how a V-8 should sound like.  And the torque curve is extremely flat, not dying out above 5000RPM, unlike almost all American-made V8s (Corvettes included, besides the ZR-1 of course).  The 528i is equipped with the inline-6 2.8L.  Ok, besides the Merecedes and BMW V-12s, this is the smoothest engine I've ever encountered personally.  And it sounds pretty nice too when revved fast.  Very good on fuel too.

Ok, the 5-series are pricey, but oh my goodness do you get treated well for the money.  And if you truly sit down and learn about all the technology, thinking, and safety engineering that went into the 528, 540, or M5 that you are considering, I believe you will end up saying &quot;wow!  This is a damn good value!&quot;.  A lot of money, but more so than with other cars, you get what you pay for.  The best overall, the ultimate.  The 7-series have gardened so much praise for everything they do so well, but they are a lot more expensive, and kinda too big for some cities to drive through and park.  The 5?  Take all the good, and throw it in a more nimble, lighter package (but I tell you, the chassis stifness is expemplary, just as good as the 7s, and built impecabbly well), which is easier to manuever and park.  And 5 people really can fit decently in it, unlike the new 3-series (not a family car people).  

Perhaps the only thing I would comment negatively about for the 5-series is the frequency of electrical problems.  It's just that I've heard from too many owners of problems with the windows, some buttons, etc., but hey it's gotten better every year, and now I think they've finally got it (the new 3-series are supposedly built in the #1 rated factories (3 of them in Germany) in terms of quality...that must mean SOMETHING).  Nonetheless, if you were to get one, don't be too surprised or angry that your car didn't perform as flawlessly as your neighbors Lexus for the first couple of years of ownership.  You know, it's just things like the feel of say, the window buttons, it's not that great of a quality feeling.  Should be better.  Same with all the BMW line.  Lexus truly feels to me that their products are the most meticulously-built.  Merecedes has perhaps been more reliable than BMW in the past, but there should be no gap these days anymore (actually I'm disappointed with Benz's new offerings since '98).  

Lastly I would like to mention something important.  There is a lot of discussion and confusion over FWD, RWD, AWD, etc.  Yes AWD, say, with the Audis, really is a great thing.  In the wet/snow, you can take off with little worry, and it's harder to lose it while nailing the gas in the middle of your turn, but it's added weight, and added frictional loss.  That adversely affects braking, as well as fuel economy (nevermind cost).  FWD is better for space, since you don't need a driveshaft going to the back, allowing less play-room for the designers in terms of keeping the trunk/back seat as spacious as they would like.  However, it provides inferior balance to rear-wheel-drive layouts (ALL BMWs are RWD, except for some notable AWD exceptions, including the new X5).  Not only that, with FWD, you have CV joints that are always prone to ripping and causing drivetrain failure down the line.  

I can get into so much discussion over this, but the review is way longer than I expected!  Sorry!  But then again, if you made it this far I guess you're interested.  Anyhow, to make a long story short, the advances with electronic traction control have me convinced that RWD is by far the best drivetrain layout.  In the 80s and early 90s, BMWs were horrible in the snow, with their decently-side tires and 50/50 weight distribution.  But with the advent of ASC+T and DSC (I think these are the best examples on the market for TC systems) that's all been rendered &quot;a thing of the past&quot;.  Now, DSC is offered on even the 3-series!!!  So have no fear, your new BMW in the snow shall steer...and go...and stop...and keep you from saying &quot;dang I wish I got that Audi&quot;.  

You might by now guess that I'm a BMW fan, which I am.  But for all the right reasons.  I truly appreciate good design and engineering, regardless of price.  But this is the real-world, about certain cars that are sold in the tens of thousands every year in this country alone, so we must regard price, certainly.  And you know?  For what you get, it's a good value.  Perhaps the new 3 is better value, but the truth is the upscale look of the 5, coupled with more space, especially in the back, makes the difference for the price.  Competition these days is excellent, but we're talking about some pretty amazing machinery here, built by some pretty amazing wizards.
