            Spent 23 years driving VW Golfs.... feared change to Corolla, but after 500 miles we are getting to know each other!  The D-4D (109BHP) - no matter what some reviewers say - is a splendid engine. Averaging 45/50mph will return 67mpg!

Roomy, comfortable - a match and a challenge to the VW Golf any day. The Corolla's modern, European styling makes the Golf look dowdy!!! 

Road holding is excellent and the 'pick-up' when overtaking is acute and effective.

The semi-low profile tyres might be responsible for some of the road-noise, but this is bearable.

Boot is spacious enough for two, could be on the small side for a young family.

The one poor styling or design fault might be responsible for rain-water off the roof to 'empty' in when the driver's side window is open and the water falls directly onto the window switch-gear!

We value the facility of having both Climate-control & a Sun Roof (Handbook calls it a Moon Roof!!!!)
