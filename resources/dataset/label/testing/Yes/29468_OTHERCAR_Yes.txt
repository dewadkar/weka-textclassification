            Before you run down to your local car dealer and hand them the down payment on a shiny new Jeep, there is a seemingly minor factor you should consider.  The &quot;Jeep Wave&quot; is a simple and friendly enough gesture between owners of the popular 4x4's vehicles.  Some folks are die-hard's, literally chasing down their fellow loyalists to flash that simple wave, while others are more subtle, waiting for the other to wave first.  What will you do? Will you ignore the wave?  Will you spread the wave and embrace the Jeep culture?  Maybe you will hate the wave and reply with another simple gesture, I don't know.

I'm certainly not an expert concerning the psychology behind users of &quot;The Wave&quot;, but I do find this to be an important factor in the buying decision.  While fraternity brothers and lonesome folks across the world may get a thrill from the sense of community and short-lived friendship, many a recluse will be angered and put off by the common annoyance.  

Truth be known, I participate in the wave.  Not always, but sometimes.  Depending on my mood, the weather and the gender of the opposite driver, I decide for myself who gets the wave.  This is the power you are granted when you purchase, use the power wisely, or don't.
