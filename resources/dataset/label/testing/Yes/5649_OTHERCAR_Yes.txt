            I recently purchased a BMW 323is at a local car dealership. Let me tell you, this car is great! The best 40,000 dollars I have ever spent! From the beautiful body and shape of the car, to the great interior features, this car is a great buy. Handling, breaking, and power are all superb, and inside the car, it's just the same. The dashboard looks really good, and the upgraded stereo system is truly worth it. Music in the car sounds so perfect, and it helps you get your mind off rush hour traffic, too! Overall, this car is great, and I encourage anyone who is looking for a car in a similar price range to consider the BMW M3, it truly is an amazing car.<br><br>
