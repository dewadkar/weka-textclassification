            The Saturn SL1 1995 is the version I have I have only paid off one car in you life now make it 2 this one I will have second thoughts of getting rid of.  I traded in a Honda for the Saturn and thought that the Honda would be the last car I ever purchased.  Let me tell you that in my family we currently own 3 of them. I feel my 2 children are very safe in the cars as well as myself however the drawback would have to be if you were a plus sized person you might have a tight fit in the version I have my husband is approx 350lbs and has a SL2 and is fine with it. I recommend this for a first car for the just starting out driver as well as a great car for anyone looking to purchase, I really likes the no haggle pricing on it.
