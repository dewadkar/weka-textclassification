            As a woman, I have found that buying a car can be quite intimidating and expensive- more expensive than the prices paid by my male counterparts. Although I found a dealer who was honest and easy to deal with, I am even more excited about the gem of a car I bought- a 1999 Chrysler Concorde!
My Concorde is black with leather interior. It has a Bose stereo with infinity speakers. The sunroof keeps the wind in my hair while keeping it out of my face. I can cruise down the highway getting between 32-40 mpg while playing all of my 1970's favorites on the CD player. Most newer cars I have ridden in leave all of the seat controls to the driver with little control to the passenger. The Concorde is different. Your passenger has several buttons that can put their seat in various positions for a comfortable ride across town or across the country. In the back seat there is ample room for adults to travel alone with a cup/snack holder that folds into the seat. Behind that amenity is an entrance to the trunk. These days we must be aware of safety and how to get out of the trunk. Not only could you see into the car cabin and perhaps obtain help but there is a latch inside the trunk that glows in the dark for added safety. 
The only complaint that I have had with this car is the noises that are produced by the brakes. During the first month of ownership, I took the car into the shop for brake work (not safety related but sound related). In doing more research, I have learned that the type of brakes used in this car tend to create these noises while offering no safety concerns. The noise has quieted a bit in the 8 months of ownership.
