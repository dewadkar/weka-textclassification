            We purchased a two-tone Dodge Ram 1500 Quad-Cab in January of 1999. There were a host of criteria that the Ram met very nicely.

We are renovating our inner-city house, and needed something with enough bed capacity to haul drywall but something short enough that we could park. We also needed enough room in the interior to make long trips survivable. Finally, we needed something very reliable, and wanted something that was good looking.

We looked at the Big 3 - GMC 1500, Ford F150, and Ram 1500. Aesthetically, we found the Ram to be far and away the most attractive. The Ram also was the only one with the Quad-cab design available at our local dealers, a feature we liked very much.

On the test drives, the Ram handled much more competently than the competitors. One must remember that this is a truck, not an automobile. By far, we found the ride to be the most comfortable and luxurious of the three. The engine noise is subtle, the interior controls are very convenient and logical, and the cabin is much more comfortable than the others.

This truck is a dream to drive. It handles extremely well in all kinds of weather conditions. During the big snow last winter, we didn't have to dig the truck out even once - just throw it in 4WD-Low, and drive out of the snow bank. Our neighbors were pretty jealous.

The only thing that I dislike about the truck is that it can be difficult to park. This is only an issue because we live in an urban, inner-city environment with only on-street parking.

This vehicle is an excellent choice for anyone who is doing light-duty hauling and desires a comfortable, stylish vehicle. The options for the vehicle are extensive (and expensive), but we've found that the Mopar parts truly add to the monetary and aesthetic value of the vehicle.

We've owned our Ram 1500 for over a year now, and have had no problems with it at all. We would certainly buy a Ram Truck again - we're very, very pleased. <br><br>
