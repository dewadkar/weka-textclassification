            There's just nothing like the wind in your hair on a warm summer evening rumbling down the road with the top down and 305 horses sitting under your big toe. Hearing the rumble of the 32 valve big American V-8 and the squealing tires as she comes off the line - just gives you goose bumps. This is a great beast of a car under the following conditions: perfectly dry, traveling short distances in a straight line, and standing still. Rain...forget about it - she'll swap ends on you so quick you'll think you're on a Tilt-a-whirl. 

Pluses must include the raw appeal of an American thoroughbred Muscle Car, more power than 99% of the cars you'll ever encounter on the road, great lines, good resale value (for the Cobra Convertible because of limited production numbers), and decent reliability.

Minuses include the typical American Car squeaks and rattles, too much chassis flex and not enough structural rigidity (poorly handling car), high cost to insure, and inflated price. 

There are remedies for the chassis inadequacies. To get any great ponycar to stick it's gonna take a concerted effort and a buddy in the business (or a trunk full of money). That's the great thing about any Mustang - take a look at the Mustang pages on the web - tons of vendors specializing in everything from drag racing to restoring a museum show piece to road racing and autocrossing (what I'm really into - check out more about my road-racing coupe project car at http://www.bcmustang.com/customer.html). Anyway, there are many sources of new and used parts to stiffen the chassis, lower the rather high center of gravity, provide the proper offset for accurate steering geometry (after lowering the car), and just about anything else you could want. Want even more POWER? How about adding 100 or so with a supercharger kit?

The point is here that the Pros far outweigh the Cons. What's more is that the Cons are easily mitigated through a very supportive, well established, and enthusiastic aftermarket community. So live a little - find a brother who still lives at home and get him to buy one so you don't have to worry about insuring it - bring another trunk full of money for that.
