            I bought this digital camera after many late nights of research.  It was really tough deciding on which to buy with lots of models to choose from. Along with this, my top choices were: Sony Mavica FD83, Olympus 460Z. I was looking for a small, handy camera which I WOULD WANT to bring on trips or on any occasion.  This camera seemed small enough to bring anywhere, an not too expensive I should say. I was also convinced by the image samples I saw from a certain website comparing Kodak with other cameras. With all this in mind, I chose the Kodak DC 215 Millenium, purple metallic.  I also liked it for its price and packaging which included the Sandisk USB Card Reader, a compactflash card and a set of batteries.
Since I would be bringing this camera on a one-week trip to California, I knew I wouldn't have time to upload images so I thought the 8MB was not enough. And so I bought an extra 64MB CompactFlash which I bought at $125 at onvia.com, along with this camera the price went up to $420.  I wasn't wrong with that decision, because during the trip I was able to take 336 640x480 pictures at &quot;better&quot; setting ( settings were good, better, and you guessed it right the highest is, best for resolution).  All my friends' cameras were film-based.  Later on our trip, I was still taking a hundred pictures a day and I still had more than 300 left, while the rest are trying to buy extra film at the nearest store.  Nevertheless, the pictures were stunning!  I took some pictures of  ocean front views from the scenic drive at HighWay 1, and the mountains and water falls of Yosemite Valley and the results were breathtaking.

The only disappointment I had is when I shot &quot;against&quot; the sun coz I still don't know how to handle it with this camera.  Probably all I need to do is to either force the flash to fire or to adjust to a higher exposure.  Without these setting most of the beach pictures which were against the light had silhouette effects.---Additional: by the way this camera is durable! I dropped this on the beach while climbing the rocks and thank God nothing bad happened, no scratches, no dents and the pictures taken were still great. Batteries, I bought an extra 8 pc of NIMH rechargeables and a charger for an extra $40 not bad though, a 4pc set would last a whole day (that's around 70-100 exposures for me).<br><br>
