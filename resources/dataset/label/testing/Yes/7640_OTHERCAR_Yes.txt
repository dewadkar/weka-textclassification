            I just bought this camera a little over a week ago for a trip to Disney.  (I already had a Toshiba 2Mp Digital camera that I had been using for 2 years, but was not happy with the zoom and some other features.)  I consider myself a pretty serious picture taker, not an "expert".  But I like photography.  I am also somewhat of a technical buff.

I just got back from my trip and took more than 150 pictures / video clips.  This camera was awesome!  Very intuitive and easy to use.  The prints came out great too.  Definitely worth the money.  I paid approx $360 (including next day shipping).  The 10x OPTICAL Zoom is great.  Anyone who is a serious / knowledgeable picture taker knows that DIGITAL Zoom means absolutely nothing.  (You can always zoom the picture with your PC software). 

I bought the camera based upon other reviews I previously read in epinions.  The only advance concerns I had (based upon the other reviews) was a comment about the lens cap and another comment about the AF noise while filming video clips.  After using the camera for a week, I agree that the lens cap is a "little" inconvenient, but not really a problem. It could be better, but I didn't really mind.  I did not experience the AF noise with my video clips.

Overall, this camera was great!  I am very happy with it.  -- Battery life was great (definitely better than with my previous digital camera).  I just rotated a fresh set each day to be safe (even though the indicator was at full strength). I used Energizer 2100mA rechargeables.
- Optical Zoom was great. (This was my main reason for buying this camera).
- Video clips were great quality.
- Easy to use (menus are very intuitive).
- Focus in dark light was very good (even without a flash).
- Easy to hook-up to my PC and download pictures.  (The only issue I have here is that the software package provided could be a little better.  My Toshiba software package was better).  

Other comments / Suggestions:  
- You will need to buy a couple more SD cards.  The one provided is only 16 Mb (typical).  I bought 2 additional 128 MB cards.
- You will need to buy a bag.
- Buy an extra set of batteries (typical)

Can you tell that I like this camera?
