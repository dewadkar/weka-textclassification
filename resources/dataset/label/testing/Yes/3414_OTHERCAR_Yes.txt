            The CLK is a super fun car to drive.  It has all the feel and ride of one of the big Mercedes-Benz but in a little package.  It is extremely safe, too.  My significant other owns one and was in a car wreck last year that left her car totaled.  In fact, it wouldn�t even shift out of second gear when I drove to her house for her.  Somehow, she was not hurt from more than a really sore neck (she got clobbered from behind at a dead stop by a car going 35MPH).  That was the coupe�now she has the Cabriolet�and it is even more fun.

Positives:
This car is fast.  Very fast and the transmission is as smooth as butter.  If you press the gas to the floor, the computers bring the RPMs up to speed with the gear that it is going to and matches them perfectly so that you never feel a jerk.  The car will just all of the sudden take off like a rocket.  Now some may not like this slight hesitation, but the smoothness of the shift will sell 99% of the market.  Remember that while this is a sports car, it is also luxury car.

The seats are quite comfortable.  I�m not sure that a large male would find them as comfortable as women do.  The inside has all the bells and whistles with sound system that was really built to handle the open road.

The top is effortless to operate.  You just pop the handle up and hold a button on the center console.  It does everything for you within about 25 seconds.  It also has roll bars that pop from behind the rear seats if the car rolls too much (as in over) or you can move them by a switch in the front.

Handsfree phone system is the best I have ever used.  Clear as a bell without all that switching noise.

The style is great on the car.  It turns a lot of heads.

Negatives:
I have never been crazy about the wheels they put on the 99 model 320.  This car needs the AMG wheels (says me, she likes them fine.)

It has the worst blind spot I have ever seen. It is caused by the roof construction.  You just really can�t see very well to back out and must be extra careful.  You must be careful changing lanes as well to make sure that you are not missing a tiny car on the side of you.

CD player has mysteriously quit working.

The back seats may as well by luggage holders...Great space when top is down but difficult to access when top is up.  Trunk is big enough for one set of golf clubs

Summary:

It is hard to really say anything bad about this car.  It is a blast to drive.  Get black�I think it is the best looking although they all look good.
