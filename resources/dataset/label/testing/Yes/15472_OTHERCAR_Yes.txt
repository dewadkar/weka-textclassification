            I have owned the Sony MVC-FD88 since March 2000 and have taken it all over the country.  The quality of this camera really showed during my most recent trip to the desert in Arizona and New Mexico.  The desert has to be one of the most difficult and hostile environments for electronics of any type, especially digital cameras.  Heat and dust are the enemies of digital cameras.

The Sony MVC-FD88 was exposed to temperatures well above 100 degrees for extended periods of time along with lots of blowing dust and sand.  High temperatures can cause digital cameras to not be as sensitive to color and so picture quality can suffer.  This did not occur with the Sony MVC-FD88.  It kept going and going.  Some of the disks I was using failed due to the dust, but the disk drive never did.  Batteries can also be a problem in high temperatures.  The newer Sony batteries are up to the challenge.  They gave me the same output as I have gotten from them under better conditions.  I took three batteries with me but never went through more then about 1.5 batteries per day.

The most extreme conditions I subjected it to was going from a hot, dry New Mexican afternoon (Temp about 103 degrees F.) to 60 degrees and 100% humidity at the bottom of Carlsbad Caverns and back.  The camera did not fog over or miss a beat.  It required no cleanings or special care during the 10 days in the Southwest.

One of the most surprising things I learned about the camera during my trip to the desert was the use of the flash.  Even though I was in bright sunlight the flash was able to bring out the colors in some of the pictures.  If I was in the sun and shooting into the shade and was with within about 5-6 feet of my subject the flash would bring out some of the colors and improve the photo.

The only drawback to using the camera, or any digital camera for that matter, is using the small LCD screen in the bright sun.  It is almost impossible to see the detail on the screen in the sun.  I was able to use to get the general idea of what I was shooting, but I was not able to see and appreciate the pictures I took until I got to a darker room.

If you are going to own a camera, you want one that will go where you go and document the events of your life.  The Sony MVC-FD88 is one of those cameras that will keep up with you and bring back your life in pictures.  I was very comfortable with the quality of this camera and trust itï¿½s reliability in most situations.  Digital cameras have come a long way in the last couple of years.  The rule of thumb still is you get what you pay for.  In this case the camera is more expensive than a lot of others on the market, but when you need it to work and work well, it will be there!
