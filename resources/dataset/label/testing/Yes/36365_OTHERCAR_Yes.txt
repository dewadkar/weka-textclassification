            At first my husband and I did not want to buy a foreign car, we bought our first Honda Accord in 1987 - the four door sedan. Well, right from the beginning we were deliriously happy with it. It is was comfortable and roomy for the four of us. It held the road beautifully and it was low maintenance. We kept this car for six years and then sold it privately. We could not believe the response to our ad but people know that Hondas are reliable. My husband bought another Honda Accord but this time the EX model - a 1994 at the end of the season. He loves the moon roof and the leather seats. The leather seats have held up very well and still give good back support. It is still a nice looking car and performs well. Honda is the way to go for reliability. The other car manufacturers should take a hint and build cars like this one for its long lasting performance and not build cars for obsolecense.<br><br>
