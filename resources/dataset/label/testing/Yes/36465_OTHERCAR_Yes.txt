            I purchased my 2002 Altima SE when my car I received for my 16th birthday just wasn't fun to drive anymore.  I was looking for something with plenty of power for my aggressive driving, style, as well as a ton of room (I'm a big boy).

I looked at a Camry SE which looked great, and in fact I was very close to buying it until I started to look at the Altima more seriously.  This car really attracted my attention, and the 240 Horsepower engine was calling my name in the dealer's lot.  So I gave it a test drive...

Plenty of power, the V6 screams down the road.  I'm definatly an aggressive driver, and I'm proud.  I'm the type that floors it from the line, and in the Altima I get the acceleration I demand.  The camry dosn't come close to the performance of the 3.5L Altima SE, and compared to the V4 Altima.. the camry SE isn't really any faster.  The power of the V6 was the deciding factor in getting the Altima SE.

The interior of the Altima is superb as well as the exterior.  Cheap plastics is a common Con for the Altima, but seriously it just dosn't matter.  It's one of those things you don't care about, because everything else is done just so well.  One suggestion i would give is to get the factory Leather upgrade which comes with the automatic climate control.  Not only does this make keeping your cabin cool or warm easier, but it looks soooo very much better. The standard Climate Control knobs are the type you would find in a $12,000 car, that just has "Cheap" written all over it. In fact, i liked the look of the automatic climate control so much, i waited a whole extra week just to get the car I wanted with the factory Leather package.

The Bose upgrade isn't needed really.  The base Bose sound is top notch, and you could get 150% more power with 900$ in after market sound than with the bose upgrade.  However, I will say the Bose sound is premium in it's own way.  It has a ton of Bass, but it's the clearity of the sound that does it for me.

Like I said above, the car looks great and I get many compliments about how stylish my car is.  It feels good to drive a car that I know people stare at and wish they had one.  The tailights are a nice touch, as well as the good looking 17" wheels w/ the wide tread performance tires.

You will not be unhappy with this car.  I love my altima, and if i could do it over again.. i would buy the exact same thing.  I've only had the Altima for a few weeks, so it is still very new.. but i just know I'm going to love it just as much next year as I do now.
