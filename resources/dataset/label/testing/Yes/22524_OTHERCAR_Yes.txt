            I'll start this by mentioning that my Daddy sold my car a week or so after I went to Basic Cadet training and lost all means to communicate with him.  Upon going home for Christmas, I found myself being told to take a cab back home as Daddy's car broke down. Well, I told him to take my Buick and go. That's when he proceeded to tell me that he had sold my car some time ago and he did it the month he sent me a hundred dollar--how nice, huh? 

Thus, Daddy was put through an endless cycle of mockery as every time he tells me, &quot;if you go TDY (temporary duty), I'll watch your things.&quot; Needless to say, I would tell him that he would pawn it all off the second I left. :)

This drove my father to purchase the Chevy Cavalier from a Major who was going to travel overseas.  When he showed it to me, I fell in love.  Not only did I find this car soooo cute and perfect for the smaller than average person--me!  I was a little skeptical as the car had well over 100,000 miles on it (yes, it was over the high part of the odometer), but my fears were quickly put to rest as this car handles perfectly and everything worked great.  Not a thing that didn't work properly from the engine itself to those little buttons on the radio.

I love everything about this vehicle as it drives well and does not show any signs of the years on it.  The Cavalier drives smoothly and the only problem I have is that the acceleration leaves a bit to be desired, but no a issue as it gets me where I need to go and comfortably.

I would recommend this car for anyone and everyone.  This would also be my best pick for a first car in the case any of you readers are looking into a car model for your growing kiddies and worry about fancy controls or price.  This is definitely the car for your dollar. Enjoy! If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me and ask! Thanks for reading!<br><br>
