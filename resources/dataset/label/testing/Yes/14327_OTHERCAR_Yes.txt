            I LOVE my new XJ-R!!!
She's fast & beautiful! I fell in love with this model when I saw the grill - instead of the simple chrome bars on the other XJ models, the XJ-R grill is more of a wire mesh type of chrome - making this Jaguar even MORE distinctive than its already distinctive siblings.
Mine is in Anthracite - black, but when the light hits it at different angles, it takes on a dark bluish hue - the color is spectacular!  The rims are a brand new style - 18" "Spider Web" style that adds to it's sporty look.  It comes with Pirelli Z rated tires (although I have never been a huge fan of Pirelli - and switched my Benz 560SL to Michellin, the ones on the Jag seem OK).
The rain sensing wiper is one of my favorite features - not only does it sense rain - it automatically adjusts wiper speed!

The interior is rich charcoal leather with slightly darker carpeting.  Burl Walnut is everywhere inside - including the steering wheel top & bottom!  I love the old style clock (hands vs. digital readout) which appears more classic.  The heated seats (front & back) warm up extremely fast and controls for the rear seats are in the back - which I love.  There are more gadgets installed than I know what to do with but one of my favorites is the steering wheel controls for the stereo/phone system.  This year Jaguar finally went to digital phones - I waited until they did before purchasing the car.  The phone is installed in the arm rest (Motorola Timeport - looks much like the StarTak - but this one is silver with a Leaping Cat on it) and is easy to remove/replace.  When the phone is in the arm rest, it is wired to the sound system - thus when it rings - it does so through the 12 speakers in the cabin.  The radio display shows the number or name - if you have programmed it into your phone - so you can still screen calls while driving :)
With the touch of a conveniently placed switch on the steering wheel, you can answer the phone, adjust the volume and end calls.  The speaker is cleverly placed between the visor & rear view mirror and works well (I use my phone a great deal and everyone I have spoken to said that the reception is very clear - not like your typical car speaker phone)!
The same levers on the steering wheel allow you to change between CD, Tape & Radio functions, scan your radio pre-sets & change CD tracks.  The 6 CD player is located in the trunk wall & has never once skipped - even on the roughest road surfaces.  The audio system quality is EXCELLENT - save for the radio reception - which I find lacking - I think that this is due to the telephone hook up & I plan to have service check into it.  
All XJ's come with a 4 year/50K mile warranty - that includes all scheduled maintenance and Jaguar roadside assistance at no cost!

In addition to it's good looks & luxurious appointments, this car is a dream to drive!
The XJ-R comes with a 370HP Supercharged V8 - that does 0-60mph in 5.4 sec. and 0-100mph in 5.6!  The speed that it accelerates when going over 60 takes some getting used to -especially when getting onto a highway - but I am NOT complaining.  The double wishbone suspension & traction control makes for firm handling (esp. in the curves) at high speeds.  It is very easy to find yourself going in 90+mph(as I often do) and not even realize it because the ride is so smooth and quiet.  Even a high speeds with the sunroof open, wind noise is minimal.  

I really can't say enough about how wonderful this car is!
For all of its plusses, there is on minus -the front ash tray.  I hate it!  In my opinion it is far too small & not conveniently located (although there really is no where else to put it).  When the cup holder is open - it is virtually impossible to get your ashes into it while driving - forget about putting your cigarette out! Other than the ash tray, the car is perfect!  I most certainly recommend the Jaguar XJ-R!
