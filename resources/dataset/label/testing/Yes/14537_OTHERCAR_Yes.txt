            In 1991, I went in search of sporty, yet sensible sedans.
I had previously owned a 2-door Honda Prelude, but now was searching for a 4-door sedan, due to the recent birth of my son.
I liked the look of the Mazda Protege and the price-  My '91 Protege LX came fully loaded with power sunroof, power windows and locks, and AM/FM stereo cassette player, and aluminum alloy wheels- all the extras were included in the price!
I chose a bright Blaze Red- after all, it was Sporty!  
I test drove it!  WOW, talk about get up and go!  It could really accelerate!  If I recall correctly, the LX has 110+ horsepower, more than the DX model. And it handled quick and nimbly and the steering was, and STILL is tight!
Since 1991 I've driven my Mazda Protege LX sedan across the country from Upstate NY to Portland, OR.  This 6000 mile journey took place during the first week of December, and led me over Donner's Pass thru the Cascade Mountain range WITHOUT benefit of chains or snow tires!  I didn't have to resort to eating my parrot or dog!  
We recently drove round trip (also in December)from Portland, OR to Las Vegas, NV. Excellent Highway Gas Mileage- over 400 miles on each tank of gas! Before the trip, I had her checked out from port to stern to prevent any unforeseen expenses during the long 3500 mile vacation.
Nothing was wrong!  Shocks and suspension checked out Excellent! 
Since I purchased my Mazda Protege LX, I have put on 115,000 miles. During my entire ownership, I've only 3 sets of tires, 1 set of brakes, 2 mufflers, and other than preventive maintenance, I've never (knock on wood!) been surprised with anything major.
I would recommend a Mazda Protege LX to anyone looking for a quality-made, dependable and Fun to Drive car which won't break your bank account! <br><br>
