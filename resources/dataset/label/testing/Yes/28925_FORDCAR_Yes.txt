            The main reason I purchased this vehicle was because our family was growing and I needed more room for car seats.  I was very satisfied with the purchase of our 1998 Ford Explorer.  Gas mileage was GREAT!! Very easy vehicle to drive.  I never experienced any problems with the Explorer.  Very spacious and seating was comfortable. One thing I would suggest is, if you purchase an Explorer, you should spend a little extra and go for the dual air option.  On summer days here in Texas is was very HOT getting into the back seat and took a while to cool off.  I would also stay away from leather seats. A family member purchased an Explorer with leather seating and the seats were very uncomfortable because on cold days you would slide when you make a turn and on hot days, you would stick! <br><br>
