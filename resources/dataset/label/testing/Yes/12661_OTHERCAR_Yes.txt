            I use to own a BMW 528, and checked the new models form BMW as well as Mercedes.  Finally I decided for the S Type.  The craftmanship is so good, that an armory company told me that from all the cars they had armored, this is the best craftmanship.  The interior is superb, not noisy at all, very dependable.  The best of all is the service provided by the dealership.  Anything wrong with the car, they provide you with a 1-800 number, you call and they pick up the car with a truck, repair it and in most of the cases return it with no cost.  Even if you have a tire problem or you go out of gas, you can call them with no cost.
Between BMW and Mercedes the only thing that I miss in the Jaguar is the memories for the seat position, however in the S type 4 (8 cilinder) you have this option.
Another thing that astonished me is the voice recognition system to set or change the radio, cd, air condition, or even dial a phone number.  Usually you have to "train" any voice recognition system.  This one also they recommend to train it, but is so good that you really do not need to do it.  It is great to be able to tune your favorite radio station, or swith to a cd or casette, or even call your friends or business associates, indicating with your voice.
Air condition is separate and full automatic, and word superbly.
Also the sensors in the wipers work a lot better than in BMW or Mercedes.  Only some drops, and begin to work immediately, with BMW or Mercedes you need to make the first step.  Not here.
The only thing I do not like, is that people stare at me when I go in the street.  But, they recognize the good things....
