            Well..  My Dad had a 1985 Cressida and that was the first time I had heard of it, and now I have a 1992, it has always been good to me and has been my pride and joy plus the fact that it has never broke down on me, all you need to do is change the oil and put that gas and nothing will go wrong. 

As for the driving, I loved the fact that the Cressida did not try to disguise that fact that it puts down the power through the rear wheels,  I found that quite rewarding, handling may not be as good and the newer Camry, but who like over-steer when you can have a tail-happy car like mine. 

As for the cabin space...  I am a student and single, so this is good as it gets for me, loads of room at the front and back and even more in the boot.

I wish Toyota would consider bringing it back to life again.<br><br>
