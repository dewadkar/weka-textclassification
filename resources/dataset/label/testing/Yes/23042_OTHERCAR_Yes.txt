            We recently got one of these camera's as a gift so we can keep in touch with family by sending photos over the computer.  We are quite impressed with the quality of the pictures this camera produces.  There is a removable 8MB memory card included in our bundle.  There is a wonderful flash feature with auto, red eye and other options (I've yet to figure this out!)  It also comes with a really great software program so that you can do different things to your pictures.  I really like the software.  The camera also has a self-timer and my favorite feature a color LCD display and also a regular optical viewfinder.  Resolution is pretty good at 640 X 480.  You can choose three separate zoom ranges/resolutions.  The use of this feature will decide how many pictures your camera will hold.  The higher the resolution the fewer pictures you can hold at once.  Honestly we usually use the lowest resolution and the pictures are superb.  The camera at the lowest setting can hold over 300 pictures!  This is a wonderful camera for the first time user.  I can attest to that!  The camera has performed superbly for closeups and long range shots.  I highly recommend this camera for a first digital camera.  The price is very good at around $200 and it is simple to operate.
