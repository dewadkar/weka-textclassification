                 <b>W</b>ith a slightly larger 'all-alloy' quad cam 282 horsepower V8 engine, a stiff body, and an all alloy  suspension, the 1998 BMW 540i is one of the fastest, most capable sport sedans in the world for this model year. Despite many sporty luxury cars once claiming dibs in this market, the 1998 540i blew blows most of them, if not all of them away in every performance category.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

     <b>D</b>espite the 4.4 liter 282 horsepower V8 engine adding more weight over the front wheels, the BMW's handling is excellent, and the roadholding is very impressive even before the traction control intervenes. The ride is also excellent, although there is a slight float at high speeds. BMW could have stiffened the suspensison a bit, but an overly stiff ride would have made the 540i lose some of its appeal as a highway cruiser. A revised version of this incredibly smooth V8 produces a massive torque output (310lb-ft) for such a small V8 engine. This means that you don't have to constantly use the 6 gears available when driving up steep hills. The shifts are wonderfully light and direct; no clunking whatsoever. The 540i comes standard with either a 6-speed manual transmission (recommended) or a 5-speed automatic, there is an optional steptronic semi-automatic available.

   <b>BMW's V8</b> is all-alloy with four valves per cylinder, operated by four chain driven camshafts. It features variable valve timing (VVT) for better throttle response and improved fuel economy, almost 28 MPG on the freeway according to the EPA. Unlike some other engines, it does not require high revs for maximum power delivery. Bore and stroke have been changed, from 3.5inch x 3.54 inch in the 4.0 liter to 3.25 inch x 3.62 inch, which results in a long stroke 4.4 liter. The aim was to improve torque, which was increased from 295lb-ft to 310lb-ft.

   The 1998 BMW 5 series is more than 80% stiffer than its predecessor. With a large amount of the structure being high-strength steel. Alloy is used on the <b>suspension</b> components and significantly reduces weight.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

      The <b>interior</b> of the 1998 BMW 540i is nothing short of world class. This car has one the best, most well thought out interior's I have been in for this model year, offering 'luxury' combined with 'sport' to kick things up a notch. This car comes with every amenity you could ask for. Some amenities include, super cold AC, onboard navigational system, park distance radar, 6 air bags, real tree meat, leather, power seats, and many more standard features and options that you would expect from a BMW or any car in this price range. 


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
   
The <b>exterior</b> is another story. This is a 4 door sedan, and looks every bit the part. BMW really is not on top when it comes to exterior innovation. This luxury/sport sedan is by no means ugly, it just doesn't say 'luxury' like Jaguar, and cars like S class Mercedes. This car looks like almost every other car on the road. From afar, it's not until I see the twin kidney grille, and BMW badge that I know for sure its a BMW, and not my mother driving her Honda accord. Many disagree with me, most say the BMW 5 series looks 'original' 'classy, yet sporty'. I have said in other reviews that I do have 20-15 vision, so maybe I'm just seeing right through this said to be "cool design" and seeing the Jaguar S-type in the other lane (ha). 

  The <b>price</b> for these cars are now around $35,000. New, a '98 BMW 540i would set you back around $55,000-$60,000. 

   The '98 BMW 540i is now going on its 4 year birthday, so far these cars have got rave reviews from their owners, no major reliability complaints whatsoever.


<i>Conclusion:</i>

  The BMW 540i offers an excellent value on the used car market. Once costing over $50,000, relatively poor resale has brought these cars down to the prices most of us can afford. This is bad news to original owners, however is excellent news for anyone who wants to get into a first class automobile without having to sell the farm.
