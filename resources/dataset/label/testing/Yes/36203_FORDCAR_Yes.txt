            I bought the Ford Focus a few weeks after I saw the first television add for it. I liked the way the car looked. I is basicly an American version of a German car, but that is only on the outside. The sound system is probbly the best that I have ever seen come stock and the panel is very cool, however, there is not much under the hood. If you decide to buy this car, I would go for the V6 option. It does not climb very well when driving in hight elevations and does not handle very well. This is not a performance car. There is plenty of room however. The back seat will easly fit three people with out any knees knocking. There is also alot of trunk space. This is defenetly a good car to drive if you are just cruising around with friends in the city. They will certanly be impressed by base and the CD player.

The CD player is very user friendly. The time is very easy to set as well as radio stations. There is even an option that will automaticly increase the volume whenever the engine gets louder. Basicly, you can blast your music while your driving, but when you hit a stop light, it does not annoy everyone around you. There are only four speakers, however, you would never know that by the sound. There are two on the back seat doors, with is very nice for passangers. The face plate on the cd player also comes off, it is small and compact so that it is ealsy slipped it a purse or a pocket.

The top speed I have ever gotten able to get my Focus up to is just over 100 mph. Now, you probbly dont need to go that fast unless you are very good about getting out of a ticket, but, this car was not built for performance. It was butild for comfort. The engine is VERY quiet. The driver seat has a verticle control, the arm rest is in a pretty good positon, and the diplay is very easy on the eyes.

As stated before, this car was not built for perfomance, if you like to turn corners fast, and impress your friends with your engine, This car is not for you. If you want an ecanomical, sleek, styilish car. Then by all means, buy the ford focus. I traded mine in for a truck after 6 months. It had been recalled twice.<br><br>
