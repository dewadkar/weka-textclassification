            When we initially began searching for a mini van we decided the Honda Odyssey was out of our price range. We avoided it like the plague. We knew it was a quality vehicle, but just could not afford it. We test drove the Chevrolet Venture, Pontiac Montana, Mazda MPV, Ford Windstar and the Dodge Caravan. Then... because the dealership was on our way home, we stopped in and took the Odyssey for a test drive, figuring what the heck, why not. While I would not say we fell in love with the Odyssey (mini vans seem too utilitarian to warrant that emotion) we soon came to realize that this was going to be the van for us. We are a family of four active people who partake in mountain biking, roller blading, snowboarding, skiing and basketball, so this van was going to see heavy usage in all seasons.

What separated the Odyssey from the other vans we test drove was its quietness, especially in comparison with the Ford Windstar, its horsepower, which at 210 hp was only surpassed by the Windstar, the second row bucket seats which could be moved together to provide easier access to the rear seat, and the fact the rear seat is able to be stored virtually completely flat into the floor. The Toyota mini van, while rated the safest on the road, and priced in the same neighbourhood as the Odyssey, seemed too small and we did not bother test driving it. The Mazda MPV at the time of our purchase was equipped with a smaller engine which generated only 170 hp and seemed to really work hard, even in the city. While the gas mileage would probably be better I don�t know what the life expectancy of the motor would have been. (Mazda has now equipped the MPV with a 200 hp powerplant under the hood.) Once we tried the Honda Odyssey we also realized how small the Mazda MPV was, especially if you tried to squeeze into the rear seat. A friend purchased a Mazda MPV approximately 8 months before we purchased our Odyssey, and after riding in the Odyssey, her comment was �Now this feels like a $30,000 van!�.

Finding an Odyssey was an experience in itself. Because of their limited production, dealers are supplied these vehicles based on the population base their dealership serves. In our case there were only two vans on the lot... and only one per month scheduled for the next few months. Using the internet we looked around a bit more and haggled back and forth with the local dealer. In the end the local dealer and a dealer located a seven hour drive away were $250 apart. Considering the dealer out of town was willing to drive the vehicle to us we were more than a little surprised when the local dealership balked at matching their price. Apparently the local dealer was surprised we would go somewhere else for $250 in savings.

Then lady luck stepped into the picture. We had been in contact with a dealer in southern Ontario previously, and decided to get in touch with them again. As luck would have it, they had two 2000 model year Odysseys on the lot... this in the Spring of 2001. The 2000 models had approximately 100km of use on them (that is approximately 62 miles to the non-metric out there). Because of the lower price compared to the 2001 models, even factoring in airfare and hotel... the savings was almost $2000. Sold.

While some people have voiced complaints about the comfort of the seats we endured a trip from northern Ontario to British Columbia (and back) and experienced no discomfort or displeasure in the seats whatsoever. We drove our Odyssey through the prairies and through the Rockies and back and it performed fantastic. We hooked up a Kool-a-tron to the rear powerpoint for cold beverages and snacks and hooked up a TV/VCR combo to the forward powerpoint, and this, along with the air conditioning still did not seem to make for unreasonable gas mileage or performance.

The Odyssey comes equipped with a cute little table that is attached to the left side of the front passenger seat and folds up to a position between the two front seats. This table is great. It is far sturdier than I would have imagined and has four cup holders built in.

The sound system is lacking in the Honda (we got the tape player) and sounds tinny. The gear shift knob blocks the way to the volume control (you would think they would have noticed this when they designed the console.) The forward power point is awkwardly located low on the center console, almost on the floor, making it difficult to access.

Limited storage space is available underneath the middle and rear seats and there are some small storage compartments in the back for CDs, books, etc. The cupholders located in the rear of the van do not accommodate large soft drinks well... we found out when we left a fast food restaurant, turned out of the parking lot and the beverage in the rear cupholder dumped all over the back of the van. 

Our model van does not come with power sliding side doors... which means we can open the doors at the speed we want... not the speed the motors work at. We did have problems with the doors sticking initially. Apparently the doors were sealing too well to the rubber seals. When the van was in for maintenance and an oil change the dealer applied some sort of solvent or grease to the rubber and the problem has not materialized.

While the newer Odyssey are apparently even quieter than this one, I am impressed with the low noise generated by this van... when idling it is virtually impossible to tell the van is running.

Overall, compared with other vans on the market... if you need a large van (and this one is the largest) I would recommend the Odyssey. Just be prepared to wait, and be ready to pay the sticker price, or darn close. The local Ford dealership had 40 Windstars on the lot... the Honda dealership had two Odysseys on the lot... which one do you think was going to have to dicker to move their vehicle? Not Honda. And they know it.

The only feature I saw on any other van that was not on the Odyssey was roll-down windows on the sliding door. This was available on the Mazda MPV and was something we really liked... but this feature was outweighed but what we felt was the overall superiority of the Honda Odyssey.
