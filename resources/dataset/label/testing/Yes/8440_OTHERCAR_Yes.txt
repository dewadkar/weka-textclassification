<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>This vehicle is extremely comfortable and is full of thoughtful features that papmer the driver and also his or her passengers.  From the supple leather seating to the &quot;asl&quot; that automatically raises the volume of the stereo so you dont miss a beat if a truck passes you on the highway, this well designed ride is all about luxury.<br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>Performance is super.  Excelleration is quick and smooth.  Handling is tight (although a little less so at higher speed).<br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>I do not know any of the safety specs on this automobile.<br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>This is an overall triumph for Lexus.  Surpassed only by the GS400 and LS400, this car beats all others in it's class.  Yesterday, for example, I smoked a 300 series bmw off the line at a stoplight without even slipping the car into its &quot;power&quot; mode.<br>
The service is unmatched.  Having owned most types of luxury cars, I can say that the people at Lexus are, by far, the most friendly and helpful.  I have only been in for routine maintenence, but they have always gone above and beyond the call of duty to make every visit a rewarding one.
If you have the means, I strongly suggest acquiring one of these fine automobiles.<br><br>
