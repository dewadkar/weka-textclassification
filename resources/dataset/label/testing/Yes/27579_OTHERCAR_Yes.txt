            I myself do not own a Metro, but my boyfriend just got one recently. It's a 1996 3-door and 3-cylinder little Metro. Ever since he got this car, we have pretty much left my car in the driveway most of the time, and placed our trust in his Metro.
I think that this car is a good deal for someone, especially a single person or someone without children. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with children only because it is a small car and has a weight limit of about 650-660 lbs. However, it really works well and is a very practical vehicle for my boyfriend and myself.
Some of the great features are: very good gas mileage (my boyfriend's gets 50 miles to the gallon), daytime running lights, air bags, and affordability. (His Metro cost around $10,000 when it was bought by his mother brand new in 1996.) 
Along with these features, it rarely has any problems or defects. The only things that have needed to be replaced were tires and the muffler, usual parts that need to be replaced on any vehicle after a long period of time. But the inside of the car itself has not posed any problems. 
I would definitely recommend a Chevy Geo Metro to someone without children or for a first-time car buyer. It has a lot of great features and has always been one of the most reliable cars out there. <br><br>
