            I was searching for a relatively inexpensive entry digital camera that still had enough features that it wouldn't be outdated in a month. After looking at a wide range of cameras in the sub $300 range, the FujiFilm was the clear best bargain!

No other camera in the range had 2.1 megapixel resolution and a 3x optical zoom. The $300 price tag also included a charger and batteries (purchased separately for most other brands) and a 16MB smartmedia card (purchased for $50 for most other cameras). The value combination was unbeatable and I was eager to try it out when the camera finally arrived in the mail.

I have been using it fairly heavily for the last 2 months in a range of settings, from outdoors, indoors, night, macro and slow exposure settings. The pictures look incredible and the battery life has been awesome! The 16 MB smartmedia card has proved more then adequate and holds approximately 60 of the low res pictures and 20 of the high res pictures. I haven't taken many hi resolution (2.1 megapixel) pictures yet as they are primarily for 4x6 print photos but the low res pictures look great on the computer as well as on 3x5 prints. The only negative I have had is that the camera is very square and blockly and sometimes therefore not ergonomic to use (I don't know where to put my fingers).

All in all the camera has been incredible and admired by friends and family who have used it. It hooks into the computer easily via a USB port and download pictures is a snap.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great value yet fully featured digital camera and challenge anyone to find a better combination of features for price!
