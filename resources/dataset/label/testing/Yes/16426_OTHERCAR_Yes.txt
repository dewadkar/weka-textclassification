            I received the Nikon Coolpix 775 Digital Camera this past December as a gift for Christmas.  I had never used one before and after scanning the pages of the instruction book, I was quickly pointing and shooting.  I found the camera to be fairly easy to use.  I like the compact size (I can fit it in my pocketbook!), I thought the features were easy to use once I looked at the instruction book and I loved the idea of deleting pictures immediately after taking them if I did not like them.

I have found that the pictures are of great quality that I have taken with the Nikon 775.  The screen is a bit small so it's hard to see all the details of the pictures from the screen but you can get the idea of what it will look like.  

There are only a few dislikes about the camera.  First I despise the fact that it takes a few seconds for the camera to actually take the picture once you hit the button...if something is moving there is a good possibility you will miss it.  Also, the camera is not quick enough to take shots in a row.  It must first load the picture you have taken before you are able to snap another.  Here is a perfect example.  A close friend of mine was getting married and I was looking forward to taking pictures of her walking down the aisle on her BIG day.  Well, I took one!  The camera was too slow to load the first picture that by the time it was ready to take another, she was at the alter!  That's my biggest complaint about this camera.  I have also found that if someone is moving the pictures come out blurry, but I have found that with most cameras.

If you are a first time digital camera user this is a great camera....especially if you have more patience than me in-between shots!  I don't know the price because it was a gift but it's a great "warmer upper" to the digital camera world.  

Have fun and happy picture taking!  Say cheese!
