            Anyone who has read any of my car reviews will know that I only write about cars that I either own, have owned, or have driven on a fairly extensive basis.

On that basis, if you read the opinion on my AMG Mercedes C43, you might have thought that I�d never write another car opinion � so enamoured was I of that particular car.

But here we are, reviewing my first British car � a Range Rover 4.6 Vogue Autobiography. The reasons for this are myriad. Not least of which was the UK system of car taxation (The C43 was my own company car). This meant that that particular Mercedes cost me �500 a month in tax alone. Add that to the �5000 deposit, �1000 a month payment, and the fact that depreciation cost me �26000 in just over a year, and you�ll see that over the 3000 miles I covered, it cost over �16 per mile. That�s over $20. That�s Aeroplane money, and that�s just too much. 
Add to the fact that on a trip to EuroDisney, although the trunk had capacity for four suitcases, it�s somewhat bizarre T-shape meant that we still had to travel with one case on the rear floor, under my son�s feet. 

So in a total departure from my normal performance cars, I found myself looking at a Grand Cherokee Jeep, and a Range Rover. This would be a �cheap� car, and would NOT be a company car. I figured NOTHING could be as expensive to run as a company C43.

The Grand Cherokee was very nice, and relatively compact, but once I�d had a go in the RR and experienced the variable suspension, I was sold.

Deal done, and I had a �98 Range Rover 4.6 Vogue Autobiography in silver with 18-inch TripleSport wheels, and a two-tone grey leather interior. 

Early Impressions
First good thing about this car is its enormous space. There is so much room in the back (caused because you sit upright, and consequently, lower legs are vertical when sitting, as opposed to horizontal in my old Porsches, etc.), and also, the floor in back is totally flat, with no transmission hump. In front, there�s probably no hump, but there is a large console between the seats. And the trunk is huge. The rear door is split horizontally, meaning you can open the top half and fold up the parcel shelf to drop luggage in (although it�s a very high sill if you do this), and then you can drop down the lower half to form a load-bearing platform. This is useful for sitting on, or for small children to jump up and down on until they get told off.
Also, the full size spare lives under the floor, so is NOT in the way of load space, nor is it hanging off the back door adding weight and inconvenience�

This whole experience is a departure for me � and if you are thinking of a foray into the 4x4 luxury sector from a normal car -  you may find the following interesting reading.

Driving Position
Everyone says it. Yes, it�s lofty, you get a good view of the road, etc, etc. And it�s all true. The RR is no better than any other similar car at being tall, but it is no worse either. If you are unused to this perspective, it can be disconcerting at first, but it is undoubtedly a better place to sit if you want to see things at a distance. This could aid safety as you can brake earlier as you see more. However, the vast weight of this car means you�d better brake early to avoid ploughing into whatever is in front of you. 

Luxury
This RR has everything. Being a Vogue model, it has everything with knobs on. Being an Autobiography edition on top pf that, even the knobs have knobs on them. And they�re polished. Land Rover offer a bespoke service for customers � this is where the �Autobiography� moniker comes in. Of course, as I bought this car used, the autobiography is someone else�s, but nonetheless, whomever had this one built did OK. Everything that looks like leather is leather. Doors and seat backs included. There is polished walnut all over the place, pile carpet, dual zone A/C, 6 CD Autochanger 11 speaker stereo (the finest stock setup I have ever heard), TV/VCR/Playstation in the (electric) headrests (this was an option, so don�t expect it as standard!), multi-function trip computer, Front and Rear armrests, sunroof, power memory seats operated from the keyfob, heated seats, heated front and rear screens, black glass, 60/40 rear seat, auto dip mirror, reverse-dipping door mirrors, etc., etc. There is so much kit on this car, and incredibly for a British car� it all seems to work! I could go on endlessly about its comforts, but I think you get the point. You will NOT be uncomfortable, nor embarrassed by any other 4x4/SUV. No Lexus, X5 BMW, or M Class Merc has this cachet.

Suspension
Not normally warranting much of a mention, this is however, the RR�s greatest trick. It goes up and down by as much as six inches at the press of a button. What a great trick � although you can�t make it threewheel or hop. RR would also have you believe it�s practical as well. You can drop it to the ground to allow easy loading/entry (and get under height restrictions), or raise it right up to clear obstacles off road. It will also react automatically in two situations � 
1.	If you go over 55mph for more that 30 seconds, it will lower by about two inches. This improves handling (lower centre of gravity), and apparently economy (better drag co-efficient).
2.	If you get stuck on a rock when off road, it will sense this, and lift you off it!! This sounds great, but I don�t think I�ll ever experience it�
Whatever, this is actually more useful than you�d think, and is a major component of the self-levelling aspect of the car. However watch where you park it � over time, it will sag slightly, so you might get stuck. It may even raise (self-levelling, you see), so you might find yourself in a position where you were low enough to get in, but too high to get out� (It�s happened, believe me � thankfully, you can lower it yourself, as long as you noticed, that is!!)

Performance.
It�s no rocket. However, it is respectable. Its 0-60 time is under 10 seconds, so it will certainly keep up with, and even outdrag a lot of lesser machinery. It does have the most enormous gas pedal travel. My leg is barely long enough to get it to kickdown a gear, but I understand they have shortened this on the 2000 up models. This travel masks the performance, and gives it a feeling of unresponsiveness. I think that�s because off its offroad nature � I guess you don�t want a hair trigger up a mountain.
The car is powered by the old Buick Aluminium V8 that turned up in the early �60s Starfire as a 215 cubic incher. Bored and stroked to 4.6 litres (276 ci) and sporting fuel injection, this is about as developed as this engine is gonna get, and it�s not exactly leading edge. It is however, perfectly adequate for the job, and delivers good torque through its 4-speed auto and permanent 4 wheel drive system.

Handling
Again, it�s not a sports car., but that said, it handles a damn sight better than I thought it would. As mentioned, it runs all independent air suspension (no leaf springs here), you just have to remember it�s very big, it�s very heavy, it�s very tall, and physics still apply. 

Economy
I know this thing got voted least economical SUV in the US recently, and I�m not surprised. Bear in mind I�m talking UK gallons here, which are slightly larger than US, I get an average of ELEVEN miles per gallon. Also bear in mind that gas costs about $8.50 a gallon here, and you�ll see this is no cheap car. That trip computer also shows the current MPG � I have only ever seen it hit 20 once, just after a (�65) fill up, when I went on a long motorway cruise. Any town driving will knock it down to 10 in no time. It�s still cheaper than a company C43, but it still makes the eyes water...

Reliability
Well � it�s British, and it has sophisticated electronics, so it�s not going to win any prizes. It�s going to get better now that Ford own Land Rover (and a new Range Rover is now imminent). I�ve had it five months now, and it�s been back for a new suspension air pump thing (sorted out under warranty), a coolant hose recall, the sunroof leaked this last weekend, and its computer is showing an �alarm fault� at present. None of the problems have ever stopped me going anywhere, however, and it is of course three years old now.  I would advise any potential owners to get friendly with their local dealer, AND to make sure you�ve got a good warranty with it.

Would I buy another?
Exorbitant running costs � pretty unreliable � ungainly and difficult to park � impractical in town � leviathan weight � it�s got to be a negative answer. But it�s not. I love this car more than I�ve loved anything since my old 356. It feels invincible (despite the reliability problems), and is brilliant to drive. I use it constantly, and I absolutely adore it. I�m sure its positive attributes are common to pretty much any SUV, and I�d feel the same about a Grand Cherokee � but it really is a class act.
I said I�d keep the C43, and I�ll say the same about this Range Rover. Until next time�
