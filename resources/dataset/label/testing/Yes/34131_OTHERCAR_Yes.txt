            I bought this vehicle after I heard through a friend that this guy was in a bind and needed to sell it. At first I was looking for something front wheel drive cause I live in Maine and maybe a little less sporty, but now i'm glad I bought it.  It's not that bad in the snow and it looks great. It's a 1995 so I can't say much about the older style ones but I haven't had a problem yet. My only gripe is that the back seat is practically useless, ditto on the trunk.  It's been very reliable so far, I've had it for about a year and it gives a sturdy ride with out jittering or making any strange noises all the way up to the speed limiter. One of the best 4-cyl. engines i've ever experienced. Quick acceleration for a 4 cyl. Too bad it requires premium gas, but overall, I love it.<br><br>
