            As a first-time driver, getting my first car was a big experience for me.  I wanted something of average size that was reliable and would be fun and easy to drive.  I had always wanted a Ford Escort, but when I saw the Protege at the lot I went to, I realized that it WAS an Escort with a Mazda name.  We took it for a test drive and what I really liked about it was that it was easy to drive and smooth.  It also had a lot of pep for a four-cylinder engine.  We went back to the lot and told the dealer we'd pick it up the next day.  

On the outside, my Protege is red.  On the inside, the steering wheel and dash board are black and the seats are gray.  Included in the car is a pretty nifty little radio with cassette player, cup holders, storage room, and little map lights on the ceiling (I don't know what else to call it) of the car.  My car is comfortable and the back seats even have head rests.  I also have a button to pop the trunk and one to pop the gas tank lid thing (I don't know what that's called either.)

Now, for the seat belts...they deserve a section of their own.  I love the motorized seat belts in my car.  Everyone that gets into the passenger side pretty much despises them, but I think they are the greatest things since sliced bread.  But, I ALWAYS wear my lap belt.  I have researched and read stories of what could happen if the lap belt is not worn with the shoulder belt.  I also make everyone in the passenger seat buckle their lap belt, not to mention making sure that everyone in the back is buckled as well.

The only problem that I have with my Protege is that it takes FOREVER to go up hills.  Then, when one reaches the top, the car hurtles itself over the other side at top speed.  I am used to this now, but it took some getting used to.  Another minor thing is that the car idles and vibrates loudly.  I don't think it's anything serious, it's just the car.  

I have had one problem with this car since I bought it.  The hood is a tad bit bent and would constantly rattle, shake and make noise when I would hit a bump or be waiting in DRIVE at a stop sign or stop light.  We took it to the mechanic and they rearranged the bump spots and added more and the hood hasn't made any noise since.  This repair cost ten dollars.

One other thing...taller people may have an issue with leg room and squeezing in the back.  I'm 6 feet tall so I just fit in perfectly, but anyone taller might be concerned about the level of comfort.
