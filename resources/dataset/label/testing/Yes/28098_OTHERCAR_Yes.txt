            OK, you should really read this epinion if you are considering entering the digital camera sphere.  I bought my Polaroid PDC 700 through Amazon for $219.  It came with carrying case and strap, 4 Duracell Ultra batteries, serial cable, video cable (camera to TV), and AC adapter.  The software disks are PhotoMAX Imagemaker and PhotoMAX Pro.  The kit also included a VERY limited manual.  I would strongly recommend that you go to the Polaroid web site and download the entire 58 page manual.  It fills in all the gaps in the learning curve and does it well!

This was my first digital camera purchase.  I am an experienced photographer working in conventional film media and favor Minolta and Canon, but after a great deal of research, the PDC was the clear choice for entry-level digital.  It has a 1024 X 768 matrix and the image quality is very good, particularly when viewed on a 25&quot; television screen.  The lens optics are excellent by any standards, and the shutter is surprisingly fast.  Aperture is f 3.5 and speed roughly equivalent to to ISO 150.  In it's highest resolution mode (XGA at 1/8 compression), its storage is limited to 12 images, but I find 1/15 perfectly satisfactory for home use. That will give you 25 photographs using the internal 4MB memory.  You can always transfer images to a memory card and keep right on going.

Ease of use is excellent.  Trust me, I do not grasp new concepts like a 20 YO, and this little camera is a breeze. Don't believe all the warnings about rapid battery depletion (yes, they go fast, but I have over 100 images on the original batteries).  Just use the AC adapter whenever possible, especially for downloads and times went the LCD is on in live action (like setting up macro photographs). Some reviews also criticize download speed.  OK, it is a little slow on the serial cable, but might be faster using USB.

The software is easy to load and works well.  Image manipulation is simple and fun(you will have a blast creating screen savers and greeting cards right in your own back yard), but it could be more versatile for really fancy adjustments of lighting and contrast. Polaroid has outstanding customer support and the help line is readily available if you need.   

Summary: buy this little camera.  No I am not and never have been an employee or shareholder of Polaroid, I just like this thing. It is perfect for on-line auctions, it does exactly what it says it will do, does it better than others in the same price range, and will serve you very well as the technology evolves.<br><br>
