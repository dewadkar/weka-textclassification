            My neighbor owns a 1999 Ford Ranger, two door, two wheel drive, and it has the four doors.  Not the real four doors, but the two doors that open backwards.  

She has owned this truck for about eight months and it has been to the shop about six times and not to get the oil changed.  I guess it's built &quot;Ford Tough&quot;.  The wind shield wipers came on by themselves, just out of nowhere.  The Ford dealer said that they are getting a lot of those problems.  They should think about quality and not quantity.

The Ranger came with a Tonneau cover, so they can't use the bed unless they take the cover off.  Unless they use it as a trunk, which they have to do.  The maximum payload is less than 2,000 pounds, so if they wanted to tow something, they couldn't.  

Now lets move to the inside.  I have not driven this &quot;truck&quot;, but I am a often passenger.  There is a whole ton of road noise.  Comfty, ummmm, no!  With the seat all the way back, I feel cramp.  The back seat is a different story, it is way worse.  The desing of the back seats are the worse desing I have ever seen.  Why can't they be like the Chevy S-10's rear seats.  The seats in the Ranger are facing the opposite way that you get into the back seat, so that means that you have to crawl over the seats to be able to sit down.  And I think that the seats are desinged to sit four year olds because they are very small.  The stereo is really scratchy, and it is like that on all of the stations, just not one.  

The one thing I do like about this &quot;truck&quot; is the paint.  Ford has always had good paint.  At least that won't good bad.  

So, if you are looking for a compact truck, and I mean really compact, this is the truck for you.  Also, if you are a mechanic, this is the truck for you.  But, if you are an ordinary person that needs their elbow room, this is not the truck for you.
