            I have the Stratus ES (6 cylinder engine), and purchased it in 1996.  I got the fake leather seats and decent stereo system, but not that funky auto-shifter thing that was really popular for some reason.

The car was pretty reasonable - about 18500 if I remember right.  It's at 45000 miles now.  

Some of the pros:

- Great room in trunk, back seat, and front seat.  Amazing leg room
- Tall people love my car.  They can actually stretch out
- Steering isn't typical American car-ish.  It's semi-tight
- The engine has good pickup and acceleration
- Heat and air actually become effective in reasonable amounts of time
- Haven't had many maintenance problems (but for one thing, see below)
- Good on mileage

Now a few cons:

- The brakes are the worst.  At 25K, I had to get new pads and rotors.  Way, way too early, and I wasn't putting a lot of hurting on the car.  I had a friend with an Avenger with a similar situation.  The same thing is happening again with the brakes now.  If you get this car used, have the brakes checked, and just be aware that you'll have to have them maintained more often than normal, probably
- Also, the pads they install at the dealer have high metal content, causing my car to squeal like fingernails on a blackboard the first couple times I hit the brakes every morning, until they heat up.  *shudder*
- I've had a hard time getting chains for the car in CA.  The car is really low profile, and you can't get the standard (if any) chains.  So much for Tahoe ...
- One of my speakers blew out about 10K miles ago, but they replaced it under warranty
- CD player acts up randomly every so often
- The two things above lead me to believe that the stereo is cheap in general
- 4 recalls in 3 years.  Not sure if that is normal or not ...

Great reasonably priced car in general.  I recommend it, if you can handle worrying constantly about the brakes<br><br>
