               I had wanted the 2000 Toyota Celica since the first time that I saw it. But, since I didn't have enough money to buy it, my mother bought it for herself. I was the first person to drive it, and all in all, it is a decent car.
   The one that we have is the top of the line-- the GTS --black, leather interior, moon roof, automatic, chrome rims, cd player, tape deck, you name it, we have it.
   It is a very sporty car, and it looks wonderful to be driving in, but I guess that that should not have been the only reason for buying the car. I feel that a person should only get this car if they want it for looks, not for real driving. This is not an everyday go anywhere car.
   I noticed right from the very beginning that the car had very slow pick up. It was like you stepped on the gas and about two seconds later you feel the car moving. Also, the brakes are the same way. You press them and you slow down a little bit, but a few seconds later it feels like you slammed down on the breaks. The gas mileage is not that great either, we get about 25 miles per gallon. The car is an automatic, but it also switches to a manual with the push of a button. I do not know how it drives manually, because I don't know how to drive standard.
   The inside is very cramped. There is a back seat, but if you have two very tall women, such as my mother and I sitting in the front seat, then the back seat is practically of no use. The people in the back would have entirely no leg room. Also, if you are tall, then the back seat is not for you, because no matter who is in the front seat, there is definitely no room in the back for your legs. For a very small, compact cramped car, the trunk space is amazing! I would never have thought that the trunk would be so big. I think that maybe they should have made the trunk a little smaller, to give a little more room to the back seat. 
   The good things about the car are like I said, it looks great! Very sporty, slick, and smooth. The leather interior is very comfortable, except in the summer when your legs stick to the seats. The sound system in the car is great also.
