            I was recently given the chance to drive one of the new GMC Sierra full size pickup trucks and I must say , It's one to own.  The Vortec engine and suspension system cause it to ride more like a sports car than a full size pickup.  In the 3 door extended cab pickup there is plenty of room, unless you have a very tall driver, most notably in the leg and overhead areas.  And don't forget the seating, almost a lazy boy and with the quietness of the design (even floored) I could sleep there for weeks. The factory stereo is equal to many after market systems.  Shift on the fly 4WD is an advantage for those of us who like to be lazy when we drive. Cargo room is more than adequate for just about any use although  I do recommend the � ton version as you may find it quite easy to fill the bed over �ton.  Downsides?   Few,  The most obvious being the lack of a clear view which is normal in a full size.  Just watch out for small cars. The look of this truck is very streamlined which I find undesirable , I like trucks to look more like trucks than the sierra.  All in all a very good truck undoubtedly with all the toughness of a traditional GMC truck.<br><br>
