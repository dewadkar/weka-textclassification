            My 2001 Chevy Silverado 1500 was the second in my personal series of the Silverado class and the fourth Chevy truck in our family.  You might think that I am biased but actually I would not have gotten a Chevy if it were not for the birth of the new Silverado models.  My last vehicle was a 99' Silverado V6 without the extra cab.  I liked it a great deal but it made no comparison to my dream vehicle that I purchased for 2001.

The 2001 Chevy Silverado is all that GM claims it is and more.  It is a tough and rugged vehicle with a lot of beef in the engine mixed with the best looking body style of all the current full-size vehicles.  I have the smallest of the V8's made for this model.  It still packs a good punch and yet gets virtually the same gas mileage of a larger V6.  Amazing!  Its amenities like the interior plush seats and the delayed electrical shut off feature are marvelous.  It has the perfect balance of subtleness and simplicity matched with effectiveness and luxury.

The bottom line is that I fell in love with this truck and feel that it really is one of the best, if not the best full size vehicles out there.  If you are going to purchase a big light truck, you should of course do some shopping over at Dodge and Ford but I feel that you will come back to Chevy on this one.<br><br>
