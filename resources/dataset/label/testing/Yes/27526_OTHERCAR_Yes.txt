            I have owned my Jeep Cherokee Laredo for over a year now. We bought it because we needed a bigger car for our family of 4. This SUV sits 4 people comfortable 5 with a little less comfort.  It has ample storage in the back behind the seats. I can take the family shopping and fit it all in. I love the 5.2L V8 engine. it comes in handy on those long hills, she never misses a beat.  I have not towed with it yet so I am not sure how it will do.  The 4wd is great to, if the back tires start to slip it will switch to 4wd automatically. There are rubber bumper guards that go all the way around the body on the bottom,you have got to love those no more door dings in the parking lots. I feel this SUV drives more like a car then a truck. It corners fairly well dose not feel like I'm going to flip every time I take a sharp curve. We have taken it on several long trips and the electric seat come in handy you can adjust them up/down back/front and tilt back /front which to me means longer rides with out soar joints. Mine also has heater vents to the back seats, heated mirrors ( great for those cold Dec mornings). The on board computer is great it tracks, mileage, how many miles per gallon you are using at the moment and over all average, Temperature out side, it has a compass, the computer also lets you know if a door is open, if your out of washer fluid, bulbs out ect.

The only thing I can think of that I really don't like, is the way the back seats fold down, In order to fold down the rear seats you have to take the seat part out (the part you sit on) to lay the backs down. This is not always easy if you are at a store and need to put something in the back that takes up all the room, you are then stuck with what to do with the bench part you took out. 

Over all I love more about this SUV then I don't Like I think its a great choice for small families.  I could go on and on about all the little things it has.<br><br>
