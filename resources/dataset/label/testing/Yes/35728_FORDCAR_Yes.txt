            My high interest in vintage Mustang's took a strange turn in 1994.  Until then, I had despised the turn the car had taken in the 80's.  This changed when I started drooling over one of the first Mustangs of that year in Car&amp;Driver.  The new body was simply gorgeous and aggressive at the same time, and still remains as one of my most favorite sports car designs.  Ford had taken a futuristic look and combined it with some of the best qualities of the 60's body style.  The side skirts and the galloping horses were there again, and the car supported a higher back and a lower front end.  The line that started on top of the back trunk followed the sleek body all around until reaching the front grill.  The wraparound headlights were an excellent change from the common up/down flipping lights that the Firebird had.  The new body was modern and classic looking at the same time, and had an aggressive quality to it that I found attractive.

The interior had also changed completely.  Gone was the square and boring implementation from the 80's.  The car now resembled a cockpit, with the instrument cluster following an ergonomic and circular shape.  The dash board was also the same, and the horn was easily accessible on the steering wheel.  Perhaps the only complaint that I have about this car is the ford's never-changing radio buttons.  The back seats were nothing to speak of, but you should stop reading about sports cars if you care about them.

Despite these changes, the old carburated 5.0 engine came almost identical from yesteryear.  The car still lacked the HP and the acceleration offered by the GM's f-bodies.  It could beat anything other then the Firebird and the Camaro in its price range, but my marriage to Mustang would be postponed until 1998 because of performance issues.  When I decided not to put up with the downsides of Firebird Formula, the only other car that caught my attention was the Mustang Cobra with around 300HP.  (Don't get me wrong, I still loved the GM muscle car, but it just didn't correspond with my day-to-day driving needs).  At that point in its history, the Mustang engine had gone through a complete check-up -- it now sported a 4.6 liter engine (known as modular) that was more up to date with modern technology.  The body was relatively the same as the 94 model.  When the insurance on the Cobra became a big problem, I ended up with a 24 valve GT.  

The acceleration on the 97GT, although not as good as f-bodies, can beat anything in its price range.  The engine punches 215HP in its stock form (the 98 model was 225 HP) -- with a torque of around 300lbs.  My car came with optional ABS, leather seats and Ford's 460watt sound system.  I can't stress enough how many times I considered myself lucky to have the ABS.  The stock rims on the GT were 17x8, with 245/45 dunlop tires.  These hugged the road quite well, but I switched to 17x9 Cobra-R's and 255/45s all around for better handling.  The car had a decent height from the ground, and was a whole lot easier to get in and out of unlike the Firebird.  I dropped the height by about 1.5 inches using Eibach Pro Springs, and its still quite good.

Perhaps the area where the 94-98 body shines to most is the visibility factor.  The back is a lot more clearer than you would expect in a sports car, and the higher front seats offer a better view of the road ahead.  Believe me, this seriously helps in heavy traffic and when you are merging into a tunnel.  The front seats are very comfortable, providing a smoother ride than one would expect in a sports car less than Corvette.  I drove the vehicle from NY to Vermont, only stopping for gas in the way.  None of the pains and the aches I would experience in my old car were present.

I have driven this car for about 60k miles, and so far I have no complaints about reliability.  But then again, most sports cars require more attention than the rest as they are driven hard.  I am a quick driver; I don't do anything stupid, but I drive fast.  (So what if sometimes I drag race like an idiot, but that only happens once in a while:})  I had to get the clutch-plate changed at 40k miles, but that was my own stupidity.  I did a full throttle take off forgetting I had left the gear on two -- the end result of which was black smoke and burnt plastic smell coming from the engine.  If you don't do anything as dumb as this, even with hard driving the Mustang remains reliable until 60,000 miles.  I will update this review if I run into any other problems in the future.  

<i>At <b>61k miles</b>, the car started to rev itself at idle and the air conditioner stopped working.  I am somewhat mechanically inclined, so I figured the AC was out of gas, but the automatic revving didn't make sense.  Doing a visual check of the AC showed me that the compressor had stopped working, and assuming the best I started checking up the wiring on the AC before going to a shop that would charge me 400$.  It seems that a switch is dead, and no electricity is conducted to the compressor.  I think the CPU is making the car rev trying to boost start the compressor.  I took out the faulty switch and calcelled the AC on the car, and I will update this when I find out the price of the exact part.  Shouldn't be over 30$.</i>

<i>Ok, the piece was 18 bucks.  It took me a bit to order it, but its coming this week.  Let them mumble and babble about the reliability on the mustang, mine has almost hit 65k and its still ticking like a clock.  And I drive it hard every single day.  Phewww!</i>

<i>Attention:  Some 97GT's suffer from a faulty intake manifold.  Although my car didn't have this problem, you must read about this if you own a 96 or a 97GT.  Please go to:
