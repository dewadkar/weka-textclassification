            The Kodak DC240 digital camera is an extremely easy to use yet high quality and feature packed camera.  The camera comes with 3x optical zoom, built-in flash, long-life NiMH batteries, and numerous options such as redeye reduction and various flash modes.

The camera takes very good quality pictures at a maximum resolution of 1280x960 pixels.  The included 8MB Flash Memory card can hold 17 pictures at a quality setting sufficient for everyday picture taking.  Color reproduction is very good, and focus is also very good.  The LCD screen works well and is capable enough to tell you whether you want to keep or delete a picture you just made.

Reviewing your pictures and using the camera menus is very easy.  The camera has four modes: Capture, Review, Connect, and Camera Setup.  The mode is quickly changed through a small dial on the back of the camera which is easy to use yet not likely to turn on its own.  There are multiple controls for navigating the various menus used for camera setup which eliminates troublesome and difficult to remember key combinations.

Uploading pictures is very easy with the included USB interface.  Load the software onto any Windows 98 computer, plug in the cable, and transfer the pictures using Windows Explorer.  It literally takes only a couple minutes to transfer all pictures from the camera to the computer.  There is also a serial cable included for those computers without USB capability.  The easy transfer makes taking pictures and sending them to friends via email amazingly simple!

You will get plenty of life from the batteries, too.  They are Nickel-Metal Hydride, a type of battery used previously for laptop power sources.  NiMH lasts much longer than Nickel Cadmium, which is the technology that most rechargeable batteries use.  I have not taken hundreds of pictures, but I have only recharged the batteries twice in over two months of usage.

Sleek, easy to use, high quality, good price for the feature set -- this is a very nice camera!<br><br>
