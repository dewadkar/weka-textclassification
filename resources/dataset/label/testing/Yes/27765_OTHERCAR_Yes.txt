            The Canon Digital Elph (S100) is a nearly flawless digital camera for the discerning consumer. It's even an outstanding selection for some professional uses where its size can be used to its advantage.

Let's get the quality issue out of the way first. This camera takes beautiful photos in all kinds of light. The built-in flash illuminates much better than one would expect. While capable in low light indoors conditions, it is best suited for outdoor daytime shots, and well-lighted indoor shots. You can't expect the small flash to work miracles.

The Lithium battery is tiny, yet lasts a long time, even with the flash in use. Try to limit using the LCD panel as much as possible to lengthen the battery life. Fortunately, the charger is simple and convenient, and will get your battery back to full quickly. Avoid ni-cad batteries at all costs no matter which camera you buy.

While the 8MB compact flash memory is OK for low-res photos, buy a 64MB card (street price around $70) if you take this camera on vacation, or shoot lots of photos at the higher resolutions. An extra battery would allow you to shoot uninterrupted while the spent battery is charging.

At a high 1600x1200 resolution, I can store over 80 photos on a 64MB card. At 640 x 480, I get almost 300 on a 64MB card, but I always shoot at 1600x1200. You can never increase resolution later in a photograph, without losing quality, but you can always reduce it. Get more memory cards and stay with the higher resolution.

Data transfer is fast with the USB connection, and the camera comes with all the cables necessary to hook directly to your USB-equipped computer. You can also use your memory card with a USB card reader (separate purchase) hooked right up to your computer. The image software is good, storing all the photos in an organized database.

You can also patch the camera directly into a TV or VCR to view on a larger screen, or even record to tape. Cable is included.

The price is right ($499). It is a sexy camera, sleek and elegant. It fits in your pocket, or you can get a small case at Target for $5.99 that holds the camera, an extra battery, and more memory. Most cases clip to your belt.

If you want a camera you will take everywhere without any annoyance, that takes beautiful photos, is reliable and durable, this is the right camera for you.
