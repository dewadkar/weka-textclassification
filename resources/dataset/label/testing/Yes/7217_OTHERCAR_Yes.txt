            You walk into your local Lincoln-Mercury dealership and notice a spaceship sitting among the Continentals, Navigators, and Sables.  When you approach the vehicle you remember the commercials you've seen on T.V. and realize the shuttle is actually a New Mercury Cougar.  The Exterior styling is radical, part of Ford's New Edge Design.  You either hate the combinations of lines and circles and ask the dealer about the Conservative Mystique, or you love it and knock over the salesman in your effort to get into that car.

Once you get past the exterior design and slide into the driver's seat you notice two things right away.  First, everything in the cockpit looks like it was stolen from the Jetsons. The air vents are round, matching the head and taillights, and the seats wrap around you like you are about to accelerate to warp speed.  The second thing you notice is that you can't see a darn thing out the rear window.  Don't worry, you'll get over it.  It really isn't a big deal after a few days.

After pulling the salesman into the passenger's seat, you rev up the engine.  The 2.5L Duratec V6 purrs to a quiet rumble.  Or if you picked the I-4, you immediately take out the key and demand to drive a Cougar with enough power to back up the aggressive looks.  You pull out of the dealership and out onto the highway. The 170 horses are plenty of power to pull you up to 60 mph in no time and you instantly know this cat can handle any super-highway you may be up against.  So you exit onto a street with more yellow signs with wiggly black lines than you would expect in all of the roads in Colorado.  But there's no need to fear.  The Cougar can handle these roads even better than the highway.  She has excellent steering and can stop on a dime.

After your test drive, you return to the dealership and start working out a deal.  It's a typical salesman so you have to haggle, but secretly you are smiling.  You can get all the power, style, and options for under twenty grand.  The only thing left is to decide on a color and then it's home to make the neighbors jealous.
