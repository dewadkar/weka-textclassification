            I bought a BMW 330 in Feb, right here at Beverly Hills BMW.  I have to say that the 330 is a vast improvement over the older 325 and other 3 series.  The interior is roomier, and the exterior design is a bit more sporty.

The dash is a little newer as well.  More gizmo's at the drivers fingertips like radio controls.  The cup holders wont hold a large bottled water (evian or Crystal Geizer), nor will the hold a Large McDonnalds or BurgerKing drink.

I love the dual climate controls, and the engine is very fast.  Im getting about 21 MPG around town which is great! especially now with gas prices over $2.50 here in Los Angeles.

The rear seats are cramped, and there is not much room for large adults, but the 3 series is not the big luxury car like the 740.

Over all I think this vehicle is a bit over priced.  The options I paid extra for came standard on mercedes and lexus.  The BMW is very good on the FWY and Highways, but is not any thing out of the ordinary.

The trunk is narrow, I had problems fitting 3 bags of fertilizer from the store.  The seat controls are nice, and electric seat controls and heat came standard.  It has great pick up, and handles perfectly... Dual FRONT, side, REAR and REAR SIDE airbags make this one of the safest cars on the road!  BMW quality and prestige.
