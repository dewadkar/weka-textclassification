            Points Are From 1-10 (1-Bad, 10-Good) on the 2000 Toyota Avalon XL

Exterior-8
The Exterior was very nice looking.  It was kind of bland looking but to me it looks nice.  The Taillights are what brings it down to an 8.  I think the reverse lights are too big.  Other than that the car is otherwise perfect.  

Interior-10
I thought the Interior was well planned out well.  The overall dash resembles old GM.  The HVAC controls are big and simple with dual-zone.  The radio controls were big and simple.  The cloth is nice and does not feel cheap.  The interior overall feels rich overall.  The interior is also quiet but the is a little more hum than expected.  The seats were really comfy with just the right firmness and size.  The rear could hold three people.

Engine-9
The 3-liter engine employs the VVT-i technology.  It was extremely smooth and quiet.  It seemed to have power from a stand still and on the highway.  It also got really good fuel economy for a 3 litter six 21/29.  

Handling &amp; Ride-9
The suspension was just right.  The ride was very smooth while not being bouncy.  Handling was good for a full-size.  It seemed like an ideal balance.  The ride was extremely smooth but was stiff enough to handle well.

Value-9
I think it is a very good value.  You get a lot of car for the dollar.  It comes with a luxury style in a 27 grand package. It offers gobs of interior room for a car this price and size.  I think if you are looking for a full-size buy an Avalon you will be pleased.
