            My new wife and I looked at the Acura EL (Canadian Honda Civic with leather), the Mazda Protege5 and the Hyundai Elantra GT premium.
I was all set to get a Protege5 (blue). Then, we went next door and drove the Elantra GT within 15 min of driving the Protege5. Simply put, the Protege5 looks nicer on the outside, but the Elantra won by far on the inside. The seats were better, leather helps, of course. Plus the dash is perfect. I put a JVC KD-SX980 mp3 player in the dash (I like having a stereo that I can replace). It lights up purple and red, just like the gauges.
    Two big peeves I had with the Protege were the seat adjustment (who puts the slider on the outside of the seat?), and the climate control: it made a hell of a racket, but didn't push any air, plus the knobs felt like they were going to break. 
    The Elantra has an adjustment bar going right across underneath the front of the seat, so left and right handed people rejoice. The controls and knobs of the Elantra seem of better design and quality, plus the ducting moved more air with less noise. Oh ya, and leather feels nice on the steering wheel.
    The one detraction for the Hyundai is the resale value. However, the price of $22,500 Canadian with 1.8% 4 year financing, vs. the Mazda at $24,000 CDN with 4.8% financing cancels out that depreciaition.
    For those who want to save even more money, the KIA Spectra GSX is suspiciously similar to the Elantra GT. Hyundai now owns KIA...hmmmmm
