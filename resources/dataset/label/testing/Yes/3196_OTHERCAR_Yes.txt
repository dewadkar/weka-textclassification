            A couple of years ago I had a great little Olympus 35mm Infinity film camera which I had used for years. It took wonderful pictures. At the time, digital cameras were just starting to become popular. But the quality of the pictures wasn't all that great. So I thought- "Hmmm. I think I'll wait until they come out with a reasonably priced 10 megapixel model- then maybe I'll think about getting one."

Well, in January of '03 the Infinity finally showed its finiteness. It broke its film advance mechanism after all these years. So I decided to go ahead and take the plunge and get a digital camera of some kind. After a lot of checking around, I finally went for the Sony Cyber Shot DSC S85. I have not been disappointed with the choice.

This camera had been on the market for some time, and it had come down quite a bit from its original price. That influenced me. The Sony brand influenced me too. I saw that it was rated at 4.2 megapixels, and while that was not exactly the "10" I had airlily assumed I would wait for, what I have discovered is that it compares favorably with the 35 mm film pictures I used to get with the Infinity.

One of the great things about these cameras, of course, it goes without saying- is that you don't have the limitations of color film. I am fully aware that color film has lots of ADvantages, but there are some DISadvantages as well. For one thing, you can only shoot 24 or 36 shots at a time. With the Sony with a 128 mb memory stick, you can shoot many, many times that number of shots (300+?)- and you can delete any you don't like.

Learning how to use the camera takes some time, but in an age when we can learn to use computers, cell phones, and other electronic gadgets it's not all that hard. At this stage in the evolution of mass consumer digital cameras, it's a little tedious but not all that hard.

You just power up the battery in the camera, and Voila!, you have about 3 hours of shooting time.

There are several modes you can choose for taking your pictures. I chose the middle settings just to be safe with it all. I like to stick with a middle-of-the-road approach at the start of most things I guess. And the middle settings do not disappoint in the least. The only gripe, if I have a gripe, about this area is that even with the middle settings, the JPEG pictures the camera produces are HUGE. To send an email version, I find that I have to downsize them by about 2/3rds of the "default" size at the middle setting level. Even so, that reduced picture "edition" gives you images you can readily use on the net and email. They'll do you proud.

The camera has automatic focusing and automatic light settings- all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a camera like this. But boy, do those 4.2 megapixels ever deliver! For a non-professional amateur photographer like me, I'm astounded by the sharpness of the pictures and the vibrancy of the colors. The challenge is not to take so many pictures you just can't manage them. It's a little overwhelming.

Once you do take the pictures, it's a snap to download them into your computer with the USB cable. I have a peripheral storage media that holds about 20 GB of memory and that is where I construct my directories for the gobs of pictures you can make. Once you have the images, of course, you can manipulate them to your heart's content with one of the many fine imaging software programs available today.

The camera has a lot of other features I've yet to really explore. You can even use it as a camcorder to take MPEGS, but the effectiveness of this feature is really pretty marginal. A real self-proclaimed digital camcorder would be far better, I think. Still, it is nice to have the camcorder capability for those once-in-a-lifetime moments that do come along.

If you're a die-hard 35mm camera user and you've been holding back on going digital, now may be the time when practicality/financial concerns/image quality issues are finally all coming together in one reasonable spot for this kind of camera. I'm not sure I'll ever go back to film now unless it's for an unusual situation. The Sony is no phony baloney. It, and its brother cameras, are good enough now.
