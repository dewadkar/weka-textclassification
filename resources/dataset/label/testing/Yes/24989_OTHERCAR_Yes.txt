            My dad bought a test drive Lumina in '90.  It ran great, despite the beating my brother and I gave it when we got our licenses.  When I went away to college he signed it over to me.  By then it had 140,000 miles on it and a few little dings but otherwise it was great.  It was wrecked with major frame damage but was easily fixed and ran like new afterwards.  Of course my punishment for wrecking it was the air conditioning not being fixed.  There was only one problem we could never quite figure out on it.  Even the Chevy dealer itself was stumped as to the reason.  When you went above 70 mph it died completely...not a big deal unless you're passing a semi with a suicide wall on the other side and a car riding you from behind.  I learned to deal with it..who needs to go over 65 anyway.  When I sold it in 98 I got $2000 for it and it had nearly 200,000 miles on it.  

My dad signed over his 92 Lumina to us as a wedding present.  We drove it to California without any problems.  When we got there we had a problem with oil and water leaking.  A seal on the engine had basically disenigrated and the result was the entire supply of oil sprayed all over our carport.  We had it fixed for a little less than $400 and decided that on the move back to Missouri we'd haul it on a car trailer.  When we got back to Missouri it broke down on us on a very busy interstate with the closest payphone a 5 mile walk away.  Did I mention it was one of the hottest days of the year and I was wearing sandles?  Not a fun experience.  We got it hauled 85 miles back home and after a while the mechanic found that the head was actually cracked.  When it was removed in California they didn't know there was a special way to tighten the bolts and it resulted in a cracked head.  We paid $300 for that repair.  When we got the car back it ran like a kitten.  It was and is still a great car 6 months later.  The oil hasn't been changed (not the slightest bit off color) and none has been added since they fixed the car.  

My dad now has a 95 Lumina that he's having a few problems with.  The paint is coming off all over the car and the dealer refused to take care of it.  He's also having to add some oil more often than he would like.  He thinks it's just a pump that needs to be replaced and it will run as smoothly as ours.  Needless to say, this won't be another Lumina signed over to us!  

Granted we've had a few problems with this type of car but I would still buy another one in a heartbeat.  They are extremely easy to work on, although the spark plugs are hard to get to if you're not a small handed person.  The oil is easy enough to change that I do it myself and it's pretty much a self maintained car.  Gas mileage is awesome until you get to the last 1/4 tank.  

If you're looking for a nice family vehicle that is easy to work on but reliable enough not to have you in the shop more than once a year then this is a great car to consider.<br><br>
