            It is fun driving the Liberty.  I have tested driving CRV, RAV4, Grand Vitara.  I finally bought the Liberty.  These 4 SUVs are about the same price.  I found that Liberty is the best buy.   I almost bought the RAV4.  With about US$1000 more, comparing with the RAV4 with package C, you can get a better sound system, a bigger engine (V6 rather than V4), more horsepower, a more luxury interior (leather seat, home link system), choice of switching from 2WD (rear wheel), part time 4 wheel and full time 4 wheel drive.

I have been driving the cars for 3 weeks.  The avg. gas consumption is about 13-14 liter/100km (about 17.5 g/100miles)  Compare to the VW passat 1.8T, It cost me 3 liter/100km more.    Although the Liberty is not efficient in Gas mileage.  The manual suggests to use regular unleaded fuel.  Using premium unleaded fuel will cause poorer performance.  It kinda balanced my weekly gas consumption spending.

Although Liberty is tall, it is easy to drive.  Including the spare tire at the back, it is about the same length as a Toyota Corolla.  I thought it was a big car and I could not handle it before I tested driving it.   I was so surprised that I could handle it easily.

Accessories are expensive.  Since the car is tall, you might consider the running boards or the stepping bars.  They cost about US$900/pair.  I didn't buy the mud guards when I ordered the car.  I found that I definitely need them.  They cost US$40/pair.  Heated seats are not standard (even it is a Limited edition that it comes with leather seats).
