            My Mother drive a Nissan Altima?  Never!  She had always been a card carrying member of the General Motors family!  She had loved her Cutlass Ciera's and other Oldsmobile products.  Oldsmobile was her automobile heritage, sometimes I wondered if it may be in her blood.

And now my Mother was leaving the family for another auto company.

For her troubles with her last Oldsmobile had been many, and the GM family had forsaken her.  Needing comfort and guidance, she turned to an auto company who's vehicles were known for reliability.  

My Mother saw my parade of Quests through the years, and commented that the vehicles were never in for repairs.  So she started shopping.

She picked the Altima to my surprise. A Platinum Metallic Altima, with an amazing amount of get up and go.

When I first drove the Altima, I really expected a lot less power than it offered.  But the Altima has the zip that Nissan's are known for, and I was very comfortable driving.  Because I own a Quest and an Infiniti G-20, I looked for the cup holders.  They actually seemed to work quite well in the Altima.  The back seat was roomy, my sister and sister-in-law were riding comfortably in the back seat, and the trunk offered more than enough room for our bags we accumulated from our shopping trip.

The car handled beautifully, and the ride was quiet, I heard every spoken word from the back seat. The seats were very comfortable, although the leather seats could have used some electric &quot;butt-warmers&quot; for the cold of Michigan.  Maybe even some &quot;butt-coolers&quot; for the summers, too.

I really would recommend this car to anyone.  Great for &quot;little old ladies, families, or a teens first car, the Altima my Mother owns is a great departure from the Oldsmobile family.  Sometimes, oil is thicker than blood.
