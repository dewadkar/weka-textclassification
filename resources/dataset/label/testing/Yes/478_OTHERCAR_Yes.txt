            I bought this vehicle for i am a nascar lover of Jeff Gordon, and the trust in Chevrolet. This car has bold, eye catching sculpture.The bloodline of the nascar ,the Monte Carlo has an aggressive edge it is one of the more specious, luxury sport coupe around. Price is in the range of $18,000 to $21,000 standard equip, or your choice of fully loaded equip.The different range of price is how much equipment features you want added to your car. The color availability is about 10 in number, from basic black most popular to metallic's red,blue,green.  It's racetrack-inspired proportions, low sloping hood, a raised rear, very sporty. Test drive one today and you will see why i made my choice for the Monte Carlo.This car was built for all age's young and old. I would share my thoughts for the Monte Carlo with everyone.<br><br>
