            After 25000 miles, I still love my Audi A6 2.7T Quattro with Tiptronic shift and Sports suspension.

I have had no mechanical problems and I would highly recommend this car to anyone who wants the real deal in a roomy sports sedan. I'm 6-4, and have all the leg and head room I need and the A6 trunk is huge for its class.

Imagine traveling at 85 MPH and still have enough reserve power to be pressed firmly back into your seat when you step on the gas to pass another car.  Your main concern when doing this is to know when to let-off the gas, as the turbos spool-up and before you know it, you're going really fast (like about 110) and then you look like a big show-off.  

Audi has apparently improved the A6 line for the 2002 model year with a quieter interior, improved brakes and head lamps. So they have made a great car even better.

The A6 2.7T, is truly an enthusiasts automobile and I haven't seen anything out there that I'd rather drive including the BMW 5 series.  In addition, My A6 gets admiring (or envious)looks wherever I go.

It's so nice to drive a truly great car.
