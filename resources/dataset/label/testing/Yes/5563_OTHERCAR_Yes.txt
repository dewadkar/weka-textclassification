            I got a really good first impression while taking a spin on a Lexus RX300.   The exterior is different than other cars, the interior is roomy and well finished.

The drive is so smooth that you can hear yourself breathing.  It feels like if your riding a new set of oxygen wheeled rollerblades on a dry, yet recent paved road.

A V6 engine and four sped automatic all-wheel drive come with the car.  The brakes are powerful, but sometimes too strong.  The shock system is incredible, you will go over bumps and never feel a thing.  Steering is excellent; makes my 2000 Grand Am SE feel like your steering through the Grand Canyon.  The interior features are incredibly passenger friendly.

Although I did not keep count, there are cup holders virtually everywhere.  The sound system is great as is has a 6 CD changer.  The display screen shows trip odometer and planning, climate and audio settings.  

A great luxury smooth car that goes for around $49,000 - $53,000.<br><br>
