            The 1999 Ford Escort, while no barn-burner, is a dependable car with a little flair. I have an SE Sport edition with manual transmission, which is identical to the base car except for a serving-platter rear spoiler and 14-inch alloy wheels. I bought the sport model because it was the only way I could get the car in Toreador Red when I wanted it. 
The Escort's 4-cylinder engine is adequately smooth, though it feels a bit over-revved at high rpms. The transmission and clutch work well together, and neither require much effort to get used to. 
Acceleration is adequate. There's no problem merging onto a busy highway at speed, and the car performs well at fairly high speeds. 
Interior trim is fairly attractive, with comfortable cloth covered seats and plastic/vinyl dash and door panels. The interior seems solid and well put together for a car of this price, though as with many American economy sedans, there seems to be an awful lot of plastic on the dash. 
As for room, I'm over 6' tall, and I have no problem driving the car for long periods. I wouldn't want to be cooped up in the back seat for a long haul, but for people of average height, head and leg room in the back is adequate. Luggage space is limited.
Instrumentation is pretty great ï¿½ the soft green numbers on the speedometer and tach are easy to read and easy on the eyes for night driving. 
Fuel economy is wonderful -- I often get three hundred miles out of one 12.5 gallon tank of gas.
The Escort's styling is relatively appealing for a Ford. Ford is known for their bubble-cars, but the Escort pulls off this look with aplomb. I think it's one of the more attractive American compacts out there. 
For the money, $12,000-$14,000, the Escort is a good deal, and I recommend it.<br><br>
