            The more I drive this RAV4, the better I like it.  I'm a professional motorcyclist but really enjoy this little car in the winter. Four things in particular stand out for me: 1) Headroom -I'm 6' tall with a tall trunk and with the RAV4 I finally have enough headroom and can see traffic lights at a stop without twisting my head up over the dashboard. 2) Handling - This is easily the best handling SUV I've ever owned or driven (haven't yet driven a BMW X5), very responsive, very little body roll, very precise. 3) The clutch and gearbox are precise and smooth as butter, by comparison the gearbox in a Subaru Legacy feels almost agricultural.  The RAV4 gearbox almost makes up for the engine's lack of power (especially at the low end of the rev range).  The engine gets the job done as long as its allowed to rev, short shift it and it's a moped with four wheels. 4) All Wheel Drive system - I've owned other 4WD vehicles ('97 GMC Jimmy, '99 GMC Suburban) but this Toyota, our 1995 Previa AWD and the 1992 Subaru Legacy we once owned are tied as the best snow vehicles I've ever driven. Living in rural southern VT where there are lots of hills, dirt roads and icy roads, this is a big plus.  It's a very light vehicle and definitely prefers some tires over others, we use slightly oversized (225/70/16)Nokian Hakkapelittas and they are superb.  

I drive about 15,000 miles each year in the winter so traction is a big priority for me.  The problem with the part-time 4WD vehicles, in my experience, is that on roads with mixed conditions (some parts dry, some snowy, some icy, some sandy) it isn't a good idea to run them in 4WD (the road surface doesn't allow enough slip) so you're mostly driving a RWD vehicle on pavement.  If a dry road suddenly turns to black ice, you've only got two wheels doing most of the work.  The '99 Suburban I had could be set to switch into 4WD automatically if the rear wheels slipped (spun) but sliding (not spinning) wheels are the bigger danger.  On a slippery road, I find that a vehicle stays in much better control if the power is always going to all four wheels so that it's less likely to slide in the first place.  AWD drive vehicles like the three we've owned so far are always putting power out to all four wheels regardless of the road surface.  In the winter, that puts them head and shoulders over the part time 4WD trucks.

The RAV4 is also surprisingly good on logging roads and off road, the ground clearance is decent and the short overhang on either end of the vehicle keeps the front and rear undercarriage out of harms way over uneven terrain.  I've taken the little Toyota places I wouldn't dream of taking the Suburban.  It's not a Jeep Wrangler but it's not a pretend SUV either.

The seats are a mixed bag but not bad overall and the suspension is impressive, very smooth and well controlled.  Ergos are good. The cabin is pretty small but I don't feel crowded.  The cargo area is surprisingly large for such a tiny vehicle.  Road and wind noise make their way into the vehicle but the noise isn't too bad.  I average 23 mpg with snow tires (mostly on secondary roads) and about 25 with all season tires.  

Reliability is great, just like every other Honda and Toyota we've had (Subaru's were pretty good too). I haven't spent a penny yet on anything other than routine maintenance.

We've owned more luxurious cars but this little RAV has everything I need and nothing I don't.  No extra weight, length, fuel consumption, etc..  It has to be one of the most practical and versatile cars ever made as well as being a lot of fun.  Think of it as a European take on the SUV (despite being made in Japan)and you wouldn't be far off.  It's simple and functional like the original Volkswagen Beetle was while being a much better car with almost as much personality.
