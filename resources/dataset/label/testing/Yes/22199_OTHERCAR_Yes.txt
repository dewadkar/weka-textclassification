            Overall, I really like this camera.  Granted for the price it could have come with more of a flashcard than the 8 megs.  A wrist strap would have been a nice addition too.  However those things are really just trivial, because most people would buy an extra flashcard anyway and I only wanted a wrist strap because I am too lazy to carry it around in my hand.  As a whole the important things about the camera are solid and pleasing.  Though Close-ups do tend to blur at times, the blur doesn't always occur.  The Menu is easy to use, and the LCD gives an honest representation of the picture.  The batteries, will last all day from what I can tell, that is if you don't turn it off.  If you keep it off while not using it, they can last weeks.  My last 35mm would use 2 $10 batteries in a day even when turned off...  So I really like the 4 AA's lasting a week.  That said with this camera, an extra flash card and 8 Rechargeable AA's you will never have to spend money on getting your pictures developed, virtually never run out of film, and Honestly within 2 months of purchase.  I have used it enough to justify paying for it.  Which all things considered wasn't that much at all.
