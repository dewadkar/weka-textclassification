             After driving a Toyota Cressida  and keeping it in the family since 1982 (granddaughter has it at college), the natural thing for me and my husband was to buy another dependable vehicle--and since we feel Toyota is the best, we went back to the dealer.  We purchased a Toyota Camry V6 XLE.  It came loaded.  Electric windows, electric driver seat, sun roof, CD player/tape player and the beauty of the Toyota.

We find Toyota to be an economical car to drive,we get great gas mileage and it has all the comforts we were looking for when we shopped.  The adjustable seatbelt is great for me because I am short and a lot of vehicles don't have that feature.  There is nothing worse than having to drive with the belt twisted several times to keep it off your neck!!!  The back seat is roomy as well, so we can take grandchildren along for the ride.

We keep the maintenance schedule up and our Toyota has never given us any problems.  It's a great car for around town because of the economy we get with gas mileage.  

I'm sure when we go back for another car, it will definitely be another Toyota.  If that Cressida is still going 18 years later--with no problems--we will stick with Toyota.
