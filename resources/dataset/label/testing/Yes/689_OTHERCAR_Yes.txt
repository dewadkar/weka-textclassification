            I have the wonderful job of playing with new toys when they come out,
specifically Digital Cameras. I get paid to sell em, so I have to know em.
The Coolpix 950 was recently discontinued for thier New model the Coolpix 990 (see my Epinion on coolpix 990) Most Digital Cameras have an average life of about 3 Months, THIS PRODUCT lasted well over 12 months on the best seller list, due to performance, Quality, and Features..... Even though this has recently been discontinued, if you can still find one NEW in stock somewhere, chances are you will pay around $699.95 which is a great deal, considering Dealers Everywhere had NO PROBLEM collecting the full price of $999.95 everywhere it was sold.  Nikon had a $100 Rebate for about Three months on the 950 shortly after the introduction of the New 990 Coolpix, that Rebate is over now, and cameras are getting harder to find.  The Coolpix 950 uses a Serial Port interface to upload photos to your computer, while the New 990 uses USB.  The Coolpix 950 still has the minimum required pixels to get you 8x10 photo realistic quality, which is 1200x1600.  One Minor Drawback on the Design of the 950, which was taken care of with the new 990....was the battery cover on the bottom of the coolpix 950.  If your 950 is mounted on a tripod, and you need to put new batterys in the camera, it requires you to remove the camera from the tripod first...while not so with the new 990.  Both Cameras Require Four AA Batteries. While I will miss the 950, we have the 990 to take it's place.  The Nikon Coolpix 950 stood out for over a year as the best selling Digital Camera in it's Price Range.  If you can get your hands on one, rest assured your getting a quality Product, with GREAT name recognition, and Excellent Manufacturers support.  You can call me TOLL FREE during the day and I will consult with you in more detail if you like at 1-800-3CAMERA         John  Parnell
