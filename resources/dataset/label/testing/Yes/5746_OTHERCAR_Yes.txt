            Having just purchased my new 2001 Sebring Limited, my initial impression of driving the car home exceeded my expectations.  This was the 2nd Sebring I drove and it only gets better with experience.  On the open highway, the car is truly a drivers car.  Very comfortable and responsive.  The weather was ominous, so we left the top up and the car is suprisingly quiet for a convertible.  There was minimal wind noise at both the drivers and passengers front and rear window seals.  I've driven in brand new Pontiac's with more wind noise.  

The car was exceptionally smooth on the open road with very little road roughness being transmitted to the cockpit.  The 200hp engine is quick and responsive and a great improvement over previous model year engines. The Autostick is a nice feature for those longing for a stick shift.  Chrysler would be smart if they considered a manual transmission in future model years.

Finish quality is flawless as far as I can determine.  I immediately waxed the vehicle and found no imperfections.  In the Limited model, I would recommend a darker color for the finish as the top only comes in blue and looks funky if the car is Champagne or even Sapphire blue (my opinion, of course). 

The interior is spacious and well laid out.  The Limited Cream leather is of excellent quality and very comfortable.  For those of us with families, a third seat belt in the back seat would be nice for belting in children (only).  All the controls are easily reachable and understandable.  The lack of dual environmental controls is a shortcoming and Chrysler should address that.  Additionally, the 4-disc CD changer is somewhat awkward to reach but I couldn't find a better place to put it.  The all important cup holders are positioned both in the front and back.

Overall, for those wishing for a convertible with some class that won't break the bank, this is the vehicle of choice.  I highly recommend it.
