            Is It A Lexus?  No It's A Rav4!!  

That's what some people thought when they 1st looked at my car/SUV.  I bought my Titanium Silver RAV4 with the L package back in December of 2000 after 3 1/2 hours of negotiation with the dealer in which I got the RAV4 for a pretty good deal.  I never knew that Toyota remodeled the RAV4 because I myself thought it was the Lexus RX300 when I first looked at it.  At that time I was in the market for a PT Cruiser or the Solara Convertible.  The dealer asked me if I wanted to check out the new RAV and I declined because I didn't like the way it looked (that was before I knew they remodeled it).

I test drove it and it drives like a F@$#%^$ car.  The handling is very smooth.  The redesigned odometers give you that racing feeling when you sit in the driver�s seat.  The amount of comfort you get when you drive this machine is what I was really impressed with because the earlier model was very primitive.  I had my mother, father, brother, and the sales person in the RAV when I test drove it and they all said that they were extremely comfortable (of course the sales person says that).  All the controls are within reaching distance and there are a lot of compartments for storing all sorts of stuff.  The seats are removable which frees up a whole lot of room available when moving big things.  The AC cools nicely on warm and hot days but I rarely use it cause I have all the windows down.  The CD player and factory speakers are not bad but I plan on replacing them.  It came available with fog lamps, roof rack, rear spoiler and hard tire cover (with L Package), and mudguards.  I got power windows and locks, cruise control, and All-Time 4WD, which I was lucky to test this past winter (I live in NJ and we got hit with a huge snow storm) and I was very impressed by the way the RAV4 handled itself in all types of snow.  I sometimes went on top of really big snow hills just for fun and I even got a little bit of SUV Confidence.

The gas mileage on the RAV isn't that bad, about 23 in the city and about 27 on the straightaway.  The RAV comes with a 2.0-liter 16-valve double overhead cam engine, which means she's got some pop to her.  I've punched my RAV up to 80 MPH on the NJ Turnpike and it was between 3200 to 3500 RPMs.  That's a bit much on the RPM side but what can you expect from a 4-cylinder engine.  Why didn't Toyota put a V6 in the RAV I don't know?  Then again the gas mileage wouldn't be that great if it did.  

But if you live in an area that has really steep hills this car I don't recommend cause it'll be revving at 3000 RPMs, if not over 3000, to get up the hill.  I�ve tried that already and if you don�t get a good head start at the bottom of the hill you�ll be lucky if you get up to 40 MPH.

One thing that I noticed about the RAV was the dash rattle it made in which I had no idea what it was at first.  It wasn't that big of a deal though because I took it to the parts and service store and they fixed it right up.  I still get a bit of a rattle here and there but no where near as much as before.

Overall I'm happy with the outcome of this car.  It's got the Toyota name behind it so I know I've invested in a VERY reliable car.  If you want something to get you from point A to point B, with some fun and enjoyment in between, then consider looking into the RAV4.

<b>10,000 MILE BENCH MARK UPDATE - NOVEMBER 2001</b>

Hey Everyone!!!!  I've just reached my 10,000 mile mark on my RAV4 and so far the car kicks A$$.  I've had little or no problems at all with my SUV and the only times I've brought it into the service department is to have the oils changed.  The little problems that I've had were some dash rattles in the beginning but that was taken car of.

I've made some little upgrades to my SUV.  I've added a front grill and plan on getting some rear tail light grills soon.  I've changed the bulbs for the headlights and fog lamps to some european lights (much brighter white) and I've switched the windshield washer nozzles to a pair that lights up when I turn the head lights on.  I plan to make more upgrades in the future like installing a new radio to replace the factory radio, I'm going to place some special seat covers from www.WetOkole.com, I'm also going to place some new tire rims from www.Enkei.com, and add some new four ground electrode spark plugs from www.boschusa.com.

So that's what's been going on with my car.  It still runs beautiful and look GREAT when I wax it.  The only thing is that it has some more scratches on the paint but that's something that can't be avoided unless you put a hug bubble around it.

I'll keep you guys posted in the future.

<b>UPDATES - MADE SOME MODS ON RAV4 - AUGUST 2002</b>

Hello everyone!!  Just thought I'd give you guys some update on what I did to my Rav4.

The first thing I did was purchase a front grill and rear taillight grills to give the Rav a more muscular look.  Second, I did some painting jobs on the interior of the car.  Just to give you an idea of what I did, all the parts within the interior that are gray (the molding around the shifter, the radio, the rims for the side round vents, the rims for the odometers) I painted them a metallic blue color.  I got the idea from one of Toyota�s concept vehicles, the Scion (check out their website at www.scion.com).  I�ve been getting a lot of attention from other Rav owners and they have been asking me where I got the job done.  I tell them if I told them I�d have to kill them ;)

As for the Rav itself it�s still running great.  I�ve had some issue here and there but nothing out of the ordinary.  I still go for its scheduled oil change and I add Prolong Super Lubricant after every oil change to keep the engine at optimal performance.  

I don�t take long trips with my Rav.  I only commute from home to work or school and then I hang out with it.  The times that I do travel with it the ride has always been comfortable.  I do plan on making some more modifications and I hope I�ll have a website up to post them for you see.

Until then, HAPPY RAVING!!
