            I fell in love with my Sportage when it was on the showroom floor. It was given a moon roof, 10 cd changer,and keypad alarm to jazz it up. It was Red with silver on the lower portion, and a spoiler on the back of the roof, and a roof rack.This car was so rich looking , I had to have it, so I bought it instantly.
I know it is a well liked car because the other day ,I was waiting for a light to change when my daughter noticed that we were the fourth Kia sportage in a row, we felt like we were in a commercial for Kia!
I had already bought a '98 sportage the December prior, so I was well aware of the way it handled , especially well in the winter weather.The Kia handles very well overall , and the price was right for my pocket book.
My only complaints about the Kia is the paint scratches too easily, and the brakes have a problem, they wear out too fast.Other then that, I think the Kia Sportage is a great little car, and suitable for almost any one . Someone over 6 feet tall might find it not having enough leg room though.
