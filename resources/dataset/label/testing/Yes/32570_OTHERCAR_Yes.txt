               I gave up a 1990 Taurus SHO for a 1997 model year Saturn; traded it right in.  Crazy?  Hardly.  It was probably the best automotive decision of my life so far.
   I did the car research carefully; the Consumer Reports buying guide became a Bible (of sorts) to me.
   Most important were reliability and safety - the Saturn line got top marks in those categories.  Also impressive to me were dual airbags, side-impact door beams and traction control, which has gotten me out of some hairy weather situations.
   Plastic body panels also played a big part, too.  There are dipsticks a-plenty in America's parking lots, and it's satisfying to see errant shopping carts bouncing off without doing any damage.
   My Saturn gets good has mileage - not as good as a Honda Civic with an equivalent-sized engine, but better than the Taurus, for sure.  And it's a much less expensive car to insure.
   It has plenty of room - I often go out with three other friends, and no one complains about a lack of foot or head space.  
   The Saturn is well screwed-together.  For an inexpensive car, the materials are of a high quality, and everything has a nice, tight feel.  The seats aren't especially solid or supportive - this is one area that Saturn really needs to do some additional homework.  One other area needing a boost is the overall refinement.  The engine is not particularly nice-sounding, the ride could be a tad smoother, and I could do with less road noise.  Still, the refinement levels are at least acceptable, and I hear that for the 2000 model year things have been stepped up quite a bit for the SL2.
   The ownership experience itself has been exemplary.  My dealership is great; I did my first test drive nearly four years ago, and I returned to test drive it again with the same sales person.  They were totally OK with servicing a long-term prospective buyer, and it paid off for them; the car felt right, it was highly rated, and the people at the dealership were nice - Sold! 
   Braking, handling and acceleration are all fine.  The car feels firmly planted on the road.  It inspires confident (but not over-confident) driving. 
   For routine servicing, Saturn has been great.  First of all, nothing has gone wrong with the car, except the remote key fobs for the locks/alarm wore out (probably due my overenthusiastic pushing of the buttons).  For that and any other service work, they always took the car in, no matter how last-minute I was, or how busy they were, and had it ready either late that afternoon or early the next day.
   I believe that GM turned what was reviled as a boondoggle in the automotive press (GM invested billions in the upstart Saturn division between 1981 and 1990) into a terriffic car company.  Saturns are reliable and economical, with a great dealer network, too.
