            It happened last spring.  I got the itch.  I wanted a sports car, and there was only one way to scratch it -- time to go car shopping.  My 2000 Monte Carlo was a little played out, and although I could comfortably haul around myself and four friends, I frankly was just tired of the car.  I wanted something sportier.  Something I could take to the racetrack.  So, I started looking around.  I considered the BMW Z3, but decided I really didn't like the styling, and to get decent performance out of it I'd need to buy an M3 instead (and likely sit on a waiting list).  I looked at Corvettes, and for the money the Z06 is a whole lot of performance, but I decided I wanted something with better handling (hey, going fast is all well and good, but if you can't go fast in the turns, what's the point?).  Then I took a trip to my local Porsche dealership.

I knew the 911s were out of my league at that point in time, but the Boxster was right at my comfort level monetarily.  After test driving one, I had fallen in love.  The styling was perfect, the performance was great, and the handling was superb.  And would you believe it?  The dealership actually had the exact model I wanted, from the speed yellow exterior and black sport interior down to the small details like Litronic lights and heated seats.  Sold!

That was 6 months ago.  Since then, I've driven the car as my daily driver, to and from work.  I've taken it on long road trips, and I've even taken it to the track.  The car handled all of that without a hiccup.  Now, it's time to take it into the shop and get the paint touched up.  Word of warning!  The paint on a Boxster chips easily.  I don't know if it's because the car is low to the ground so rocks don't have to bounce as far, or if the angle of the hood and fenders make them rock magnets or what, but you are going to get chips in the paint if you don't take precautions.  After I have the current set of chips touched up, I'm having StonGard applied to protect against these issues.  Sure, it's a couple hundred dollars, but it's better than touching up the paint every six months.

Aside from the paint chips, the only real problem I have with the car is the vinyl rear window.  Porsche finally got a clue with the 2003 model year, so maybe there'll eventually be a retrofit for older models.  Otherwise, I'd be surprised if this window lasts three years.  I plan on keeping the car much longer than that, regardless.

The car has never been in the shop for any repairs.  I've had it in once to replace the gas cap on recall, once to get a complimentary inspection before going to the race track, and will be again soon for paint touch-up and StonGard application.  I know other Boxster owners have had many and various technical issues with their cars, so I guess I've just been lucky so far.  I fully expect not to have any problems at least up until the first annual service (15,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first), and even then I really don't expect any problems to crop up.  The car has been completely solid and reliable.
