            mazda's slogan &quot;get in. be moved.&quot; fits the mpv perfectly. with plenty of room for four people and their luggage,
the mpv is a great people mover. and it'll get you there in style. with the optional 6-cd changer in the dash and
cupholders galore (and bottleholders in the doors!) everyone can enjoy great tunes and their lattes (or evian)
in comfort. the folding rear seat is really trick, folding nicely into a well which gives a tremendous amount of room
for storing luggage, groceries, camping gear, whatever. with the third seat in use, any combination of seven
adults and children can be accommodated, and the middle &quot;side-by-slide&quot;tm seats offer easy entry to that
back seat. another innovation is windows that roll down....in the sliding doors!  about the only creature comfort
that isn't offered is electric/heated seats.
on the plus side, the mpv belies its modest outward size with interior room galore. one never gets that cramped
feeling that other minivans exhibit. it's very comfortable, has a nice sound system, plenty of storage (including
a map tray under the front passenger seat), and enough cup holders for the entire soccer team.
the one slightly negative feature is the 2.5 liter dohc v-6 engine, the only one offered. while it is crisp and seems to have enough torque and horsepower,  it won't pull those seven people and their junk around quite as well as a 3.0 liter. but, as long as you weren't planning on taking the mpv out to the drag strip, you'll do just fine in this nicely styled, front-wheel
drive, newly redesigned minivan from mazda.<br><br>
