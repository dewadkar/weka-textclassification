            Value
Even though I bought this item used, I still think it is a good buy.  It offers a lot of the "prosumer" features and a lot cheaper price than its big brother CP995 and its competitors.  For me, those kinds of camera's are over kill.  The 880 provides almost all the functions that higher end camera does, but in a smaller and more practical package.

Design
The exterior is easy to handle, and buttons are easy to depress.  My only complaint about the exterior design is the "glary" LCD.  If you are in a daytime outside setting, the glare basically renders the LCD useless.  You can barely see anything, even the hi-contrast menus


Performance
This camera is pretty much feature loaded.  I'm not going to list them all. However, my favorite is the Best Shot Selector, though it maybe be a little buggy, it works well 99% of the time.  Color reproduction is quite accurate.  Clarity is more than I expected from such a small camera.  However, I have found it quite difficult to take sharp shots without a tripod.  I have to put in some effort to get a clear sharp capture.
