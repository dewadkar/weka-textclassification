            We purchased the 2000 VW Passat Wagon as a replacement for our 95 Chevy Blazer as our &quot;family&quot; car. With only one child, I still wanted to look cool cruising around town and not resort to purchasing a minivan. But what I missed most with our Blazer, was the &quot;feel&quot; of a car, including the comfort, handling, and visibility. But, I didn't want to give up the extra room the SUV offered as well as the 4 wheel drive. The Passat 4motion Wagon had all of what I wanted and more!

Driving the Passat is a luxurious change from driving an SUV. The V6 is quick and powerful and it feels truly solid on the road. The retro wood/chrome details on the interior dash combine sophisication with fun and keep it far from &quot;farty&quot;. Add to that the 5 speed &quot;Tiptronic&quot; feature (maybe you've seen it in a Porche) and you've got yourself a car that's not only functional, but really, really, fun to drive. The back seat is extremely comfortable and roomy. I recently sat back there for our drive 4 hours from vacation(I fell asleep).  Heated leather (real) seats and heated side mirrors,6-disc CD changer, rain-sensing windshield wipers (an amazing feature) make me feel like I'm driving a car twice the price. 

But wait -  it's more than just a fast luxury car. As a parent of a toddler, I must point out one other feature that I feel makes this car invaluable to me. That's the rear seatbelt locking feature. For those of you who have installed a child safety seat, you know the challenges of getting it in properly with a retractable shoulder belt - the need for an added &quot;locking clip&quot; to keep the seat from loosening. Well... you can thank the engineers at VW for finding a way to eliminate that stupid little clip that always gets lost. The rear side seatbelts on the Passat can be set to automatically lock, so that there is no additional slack once a child seat is installed. Yes! I said &quot;automatically lock&quot;. It's amazing, actually. I didn't believe it until I tried it myself. In addition, all 2000 models come with the ISOFIX system for installing child seats. However, ISOFIX seats are impossible to find. Never the less, installing a child seat takes 1/2 the time as it did in my Blazer.

I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty and luxurious alternative to an SUV. It's amazing for the price. <br><br>
