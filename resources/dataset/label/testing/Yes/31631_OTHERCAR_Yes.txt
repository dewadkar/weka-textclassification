            In searching for a digital camera I identified the following features as important and decisive in my purchase decision:

1. Image quality
2. Ease of use
3. Zoom (optical or digital) 
4. Camera size (portability)
5. Battery consumption
6. Optical viewfinder vs. LCD
7. Other features (self timer, tripod mount)
8. Price.

I test ran a number of models before buying the Nikon 800 based on it's  satisfaction of the above listed criteria.  The only con I can readily think of is the digital zoom.  Optical zoom is preferable but not readily available on many reasonably priced cameras.  The image quality on this camera is exceptional in light or dark situations, closeup or far away.  In auto mode this is a very easy camera to operate.  As for features there plenty enough to satisfy the amateur, including black and white, fisheye, many light and exposure settings.  The action is fairly fast on this camera and I've found it exceptional in low light and in under unsteady conditions.  For physical features the LCD is clear and accurate colorwise, there is also an optical viewfinder for framing pictures in bright sunlight or at night, a tripod mount, self-timer, easy to reach and understand controls.  Battery consumption is a major plus with this camera compared to others.  With two pairs of nickel hydrides and a recharger (See my review on Nickel Hydride batteries for your digital Camera), I've never been in a pinch for battery power even with heavy LCD viewing.  The size of the camera doesn't lend itself to pocket carrying, but is small enough for a purse or the average car console compartment.  Storage capacity is standard 8mb (30 pictures in normal mode) which I've upgraded to 15mb (60 pics) although at the time of my purchase 8mb was fairly generous.  All and all a very good value for the money and a great camera of solid construction which should give the purchaser years of enjoyment.  Highly recommended.<br><br>
