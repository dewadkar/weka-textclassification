            The Canon PowerShot S100 &quot;Digital Elph&quot; digital camera is awesome and remarkable.  Awesome because it takes great pictures, remarkable because it's so small -- compact like an APS camera -- yet packs in so many functions.  I do wish Canon had included better software.

The S100 has 2X optical zoom (35-70mm) and ISO 100 sensitivity.  Nothing to write home about, but the image quality is awesome even in low light situations.  You can even print enlarged prints with well-lit images.  The quality truly bests many of the 3-megapixel cameras on the market today.  I simply do not understand how Canon's engineers achieved this feat.  The flash mode also seems better than most other digital cameras: it gives even and smooth flash, not the harsh kind we often see.

The basic functions are easy to use, but if the more advanced ones can be a pain in the neck to learn and remember.  The manual is so-so, but luckily is written in good English.  I think most people can start using the S100 without having to read the manual, although you definitely need to read it if you want to know how to play with the various settings.

The battery is small and is of the chargeable LiIon type.  You definitely need a second battery.  The battery recharges in a &quot;rapid&quot; recharger and takes about 2 hours.  I tend to take pictures with the LCD turned off, so I can take quite a number of pictures on a single charge.  I heard that if you use the LCD continuously and shoot 50% with flash, you are spent in about 50 pictures.  That's why you need a second battery.

The styling and compactness of the S100 are its &quot;wow&quot; factor.  Just incredible.  You have to see one up close to really appreciate its portability and ruggedness.  If you want to impress your friends, this is definitely the gadget to get.

The software is the weak point.  Downloading pictures to PC via USB is fast but a pain in the butt with the enclosed software.  Maybe easier if you stick the CompactFlash (8MB included with the camera) into a PC Card reader.  I think that while Japanese companies make the best hardware in the world, their software stinks.

But I still love this camera.  No regrets whatsoever.  Everyone should get one.  Awesome!<br><br>
