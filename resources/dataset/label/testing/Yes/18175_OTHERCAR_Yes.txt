<TEXT>
            I got this car at the age of 17 (with 108k on the odometer) and it lasted me until I was 20 (and 163k). Which is impressive if you think about it.

<b>Exterior</b>
Good-looking Pontiac sporty styling. I always liked the looks best of the Bonneville in the Pontiac lineup. Until 2000 when they uglified it, the Bonnie's were the only car without a ton of ugly ribbing (Grand Prixes too).

<b>Interior</b>
The interior was fair. The seats were pretty cheap and not well bolstered. The stock radio was bad but it got tossed early on anyhow. The switch-gear was fair but stuff broke. Like the turn-signal stalk. And the driver's side seatbelt. Annoying stuff.

<b>Performance</b>
This was definitely the highlight of this car. It had a 3.8L V6 making 170hp and 225ft/lbs torque. 170hp might not seem like much but this car had a ton of low-end power. I added a K&N cone intake which helped with the top-end as well. I used to street race the car and would beat lots of little imports with it. It was governed at 108mph, a speed which it did not have a problem getting to.

The car got around 18mpg in city driving, and low 20s on the highway.

Handling was so-so, not sloppy, but with a fair amount of body roll and it was a big car. It was not something that could be tossed around a back road. The brakes were strong and worked well.

<b>Reliability</b>
I replaced a bunch of stuff on this car. That said none of it was expensive, just annoying stuff.  I had an alternator go on me, replaced that myself.  Did a bunch of brake jobs, both front and back, broke the front sway bar and replaced it. The shop did a couple small things, I can't remember. All in all it was a cheap car to own. There were no $400 timing belt jobs or $800 clutch jobs like I have with my Honda. Parts were cheap for it.

As all good things must come to an end, around 162k the differential in the trans grenaded. It happened around a long road trip and it overheated the trans fluid and the tranny began slipping like mad. I nursed it back to CT (those six hours were scary) and a couple days later it went and simply would not engage anymore. Rather than rebuild the trans at $1500 I junked the car. I got into little Japanese imports and haven't looked back.
