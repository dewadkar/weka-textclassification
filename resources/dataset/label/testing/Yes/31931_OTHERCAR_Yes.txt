            I bought my Celica used and it's now 6 years old and one of the most solidly built and reliable cars I've ever owned.  I have the 2.2 Litre GT which is a five speed manual.  The acceleration on this car is adequate although it doesn't compare with say a Mustang, but what it lacks in raw power is very quickly made up for in handling.  This is the best car I've ever owned for taking turns and generally providing a smooth ride on a curvy road as well as on the straightaway.  Basically a very fun car to drive, mine was loaded with options including power sunroof and the sport package which includes power windows, locks, AC, etc.  

A very pleasing car to look at.  '94 was the first year that this design was used and it wasn't changed until 2000.  I really think the Celica peaked in regards to styling with both the '91 to '93 and with the '94 to '99 body designs.  The 2000 Celica has had it's price dropped considerably and takes on a modern design which may be slightly ahead of it's time and will eventually grow on people, or may be a miss esthetically altogether.  It's perhaps too early to tell.  

I was actually looking for a new '99 when I ended up buying the '94.  These cars a fairly rare where I live, which is a selling point for me, and a new model would take 6 months to ship in as well as the fact that they didn't have a color a really liked (having dropped black, and forest green which were available the previous year).  They just happened to have one on the lot which I took for 1/2 the price of a new model.  I think that these cars were rare here due to the fact that they were overpriced, which adds appeal for those who can afford them because it makes the car somewhat of a novelty.  

All in all it's a good way to enter the sportscar market without a huge outlay of cash and reliability has been incredible as I've been told again and again is the case with Toyota.  Nothing on this car has rattled yet and I have 65,000 miles on it.  Even the tires haven't worn excessively (still first set) which attests to the smoothness of this car and it's compatibility with the road.

I'm not sure what changes have been made to the new 2000 model Celica's other than dropping the price and changing the look, but if your in the market for an existing model which has proven itself mechanically and is sure to reliable for a good many years, then this is a car worth consideration. 

The only mechanical work to date which needed to be done have been the replacement of the CV boots which can be quite expensive at the dealership.  The dealer quoted me $495.00 while I ended up having it done at a garage for $140.00 plus parts. (Canadian prices).  I've heard that CV Boots cracking are a common problem on Camrys as well and are perhaps more of a Toyota problem than a Celica one.  

Bottom line is great reliability, great looker and fun to drive.  A good value.   <br><br>
