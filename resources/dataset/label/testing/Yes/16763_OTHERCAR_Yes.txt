            Let me first state that I had read all the previous reviews on the Olympus C4000. I found them both helpful and true to form. My intention is not to embellish, confirm or deny those reviews. My plan here is to review the camera with additional facts from a different perspective. I had some very specific needs in mind when I started my research on buying my first digital camera. I wanted to start selling my art on the internet, use it for resource photos, and if possible to take regular pictures of family events. I also wanted to do it as cheaply as possible. 

I did my homework on photographing items to sell via websites and discovered that 2 megapixels would be good enough and started looking in that category. I also wanted some very specific features like manual focus and shutter control. After days of pouring over epinions&#146 reviews and manufacturer sites, I couldn&#146t find a camera that would make me totally happy. I then began expanding my ranges like price, and pixels and it quickly became apparent that the Olympus C4000 was exactly what I was looking for. 

Let first point out that I have never taken any photos under the SHQ mode &#150 the highest megapixel setting possible. The only thing you waste that way is memory. And I doubt I will ever use the movie mode &#150 unless I run into Big Foot.

As soon as the camera arrived, I studied the manual somewhat [the short version supplied in hardcopy does not do the camera justice. I highly recommend reading the PDF file on the CD supplied]. My first job was to photograph some inventory. I know nothing about photography, old or new, and it showed after downloading these first shots. I can&#146t blame the camera, I just don&#146t know enough about aperture settings, lighting and depth of focus. If your inexperienced like me you may find the extra features confusing.  However, I do like the whole digital concept of discovering this right away instead of waiting a few days to get back useless prints.  Since then, I have checked out Olympus&#146 website and found some nice tutorials on the subject, but I haven&#146t tried them yet. Even so, I was able to corrected the colors and whatnots of those original photos with software. I give the C4000 a &#147B&#148 on this one.

My next trial was to take it out into the &#147wild&#148 and see what it can do. My paintings are all pretty much floral and landscapes, and luckily for me the flowers were starting to bloom. This time, I just tried setting it to auto and let the camera do the thinking. I took some shots in both full sun and overcast. Beautiful! When I magnified on a flower petal, it was like nothing I&#146ve ever seen. I also model train layouts and often find I need reference shots of common, boring everyday things like bridges and factories. While driving the highway, I decided to try shooting out my window at 50 mph. The C4000 has some nifty choices here, so I tried all of them out. The first was with &#147Shutter priority&#148 (the best to date), and the second was the &#147Sports shooting&#148 mode. It also has a sequential shooting&#148 mode whereby you just push the button and it keeps shooting one after another up to 8 shots. Again, I was just floored with the results. In one shot a truck going the opposite direction was also going 50 mph. As I magnified in on it, it looked as though it was parked there. The tires showed no blur to them at all. The building, at least a ï¿½ mile away, was shown in perfect detail. That evening I just had to try out the &#147Night Scene shooting&#148. Again &#150 WOW! You need to stabilize the camera, but it lit up the neighborhood like my naked eye will never see. I can&#146t wait until the next fireworks! A big &#147A+&#148 on this trial.

The final trial was what most people want a camera for. Just to take shots of the family and friends. I took several photos of my kids over several days. I had to say, they looked great on my monitor. The camera also has the option with a supplied cable to display your shots on a TV monitor, but I didn&#146t try that out. I figure the computer monitor will always look better. Still, to me the big test would be to take them to a photo center and print them out like they are regular film. In preparation, I left some as is, I cropped some with the software and even magnified one at 200%. One of our grocery stores has a processing machine designed specifically for digital cameras. You can use your memory card, floppy, or CD and it will print out 4 by 6s of what you want for about 50 cents apiece. When I got them back, I must say I was disappointed. Even with 4 megapixels, the best resolution, you could still tell they were taken with a digital camera. You had to look close, but the edges still had that harsh edge. Some even with a jagged line depending on it&#146s angle. Maybe a 5 or 6 megapixel would eliminate it, I don&#146t know. But if you&#146re really into photography, and quality photos, stick with film. I must say though that the C4000 took better pictures than my cheap $50 35mm, and the 200% photo was as good as the others. I was also disappointed with the color processing of the store &#150 but I can&#146t blame that on the camera. I give it a &#147C&#148 since I have no real comparison to judge it by except 35mm film.

Other notes of interest: Even though I sort expected this, you will need to purchase about $100 on accessories. I got a 128mb smart card (even then, you only get 50 photos of SHQ quality shots), a camera case, three sets of lithium batteries and a quick charger. I can&#146t see going with less. Also, the software it comes with is pretty lame. Luckily I have a few good photo software packages to use instead. Even Microsoft&#146s free &#147Picture Express&#148 was better than Olympus&#146 &#147CAMEDIA&#148.

All and all, I think I got more camera here than I need. Still, I would rather have more than I need instead of wishing I had more than I do. I&#146m going to have a lot of fun trying the bells and whistles, and doubt I&#146ll miss the few extra bucks I spent a year from now. After about 6 months, I&#146ll update this review.
