            To fell the full effect feel free to listen to your favorite &#14580;s music while reading this review.

It was time where greed was good, Ronald Reagan was outspending the Soviet Union to end the cold war, cool cars were few and far between, and yuppies were buying BMWs in droves.  In fact European cars were becoming so cool that Ford wanted a piece of the yuppie action.  Ford thought, &#147hey you know we got some cool cars like our Ford Sierra being made by our European division so why don&#146t we sell &#145em here in the good ol&#146 USA.  That&#146ll show BMW!&#148  And so it became true.  There was a problem however.  The European engines did not have to have to meet the same stringent emissions standards as US engines did.  So Ford thought, &#147hey you know we got a cool engine in our SVO Mustang so let&#146s chuck the European engine, and throw our cool turbocharged SVO engine in.&#148   And so it became true.  There was yet another problem though.  Ford thought, &#147Um well like how are we going to sell these things.  BMW buyers won&#146t want to buy a sophisticated European car from a dealership that sells Crown Victorias and Fairmonts.  Arghh!! What are we going to do!!  Hey what about Mercury?  Yeah I mean that&#146s out upscale division right?  We can sell it along with our Lincolns. Cool.  Crap you mean Oldsmobile has a copy right on the name Cierra and Sierra.  Golly Gee Whiz!! (Expletive deleted)  Well we will have to call it something different then.  Hey what&#146s German for Mercury?  Merkur you say. Well I guess that&#146ll work.&#148  And so it became true.  Unfortunately Ford didn&#146t think through the whole Lincoln-Mercury division marketing a cool sophisticated European performance car concept well enough.  This along with some internal politics at Ford made the whole Merkur brand a complete failure that only lasted 4 years (1985-1989) before Ford pulled the plug.  The cars they produced including the Merkur XR4ti based on the European Ford Sierra, and the Merkur Scorpio based on the Euro Ford Granada were amazing though.

The Merkur XR4ti was an amazing car that was ahead of its time.  It had distinctive European styling that still looks fresh today, a sophisticated independent suspension, excellent handling, and a high performance turbo charged engine that got excellent fuel economy.  Reliability for these vehicles was not stellar, and the Town Car and Topaz mechanics in Lincoln-Mercury dealerships didn&#146t understand how to fix them well enough.  If properly maintained, however, these cars can provide many years of excellent driving pleasure.  Many Merkurs have long since died, but there is a fiercely loyal group of enthusiasts dedicated to keeping these cars on the road.  Pretty much any information needed to fix the cars can be found on the Internet.  Some parts can be a little difficult to get a hold of, but many can be had from Europe, and the drive train is shared with SVO mustangs and Thunderbird turbo coupes, so engine parts aren&#146t hard to find.  Most parts can be had at reasonable prices.  In the last year or so Merkurs have become increasingly difficult to find.  In the authors opinion the Merkur XR4ti is one of the few desirable mainstream cars from the &#14580;s.  They are a great bargain, and can be made to perform very well for very cheap.  Whether or not they will become valuable or collectable remains to be seen.

As I have said handling for the car is excellent.  The car has a near perfect 50/50 weight distribution which makes for some fun handling characteristics.  Many Merkurs are using in auto crossing and amateur racing.  Early Merkurs(85-86) came with 14 inch wheels, and later models(87-89) came with 15 inch wheels.  The car was not designed for larger wheels, so care has to be taken when putting on larger rims.  There are plenty of other aftermarket suspension bits that can be used to tune the suspension to how you want it.

The turbo 2.3 that came with the engine is a rugged little engine that can be tuned to produce copious amounts of power.  Automatic XR4tis had their engines detuned to 150 HP because the automatic transmission could not take that much power.  Manual transmission XR4tis had engines that produced 175 HP.  With a few cheap modifications these engines can produce 220 HP or so, and some people have modified them to produced over 300 HP.  Those who tune their cars for increased power often install the T-5 transmission from the mustang, which bolts in with minor modifications.  Some have even put other powerful 6 and 8 cylinder engines in their cars.  Being turbo charged, the 2.3 liter engine does not produce any power until the turbo spools up, which happens only at higher RPMS.  This phenomenon called turbo lag gives the Merkur a distinctive character.  The rush of the turbo coming on is incredible.

In addition to handling and driving well, the inside of the Merkur is a comfortable place to spend time.  The interior is roomy and spacious enough to carry 4 people in comfort.  Many of the cars equipped with leather interiors have had the seams split, but these can be repaired.  In addition the hatchback body style and fold down rear seats makes the car very practical for carrying large amounts of cargo.

All in all the Merkur is a fun satisfying car to own.  Most XR4tis out there will have 150K miles on them and will be in need of attention to keep them on the road, so if you are looking for a reliable transportation device, go for the used Corolla or Civic or get a new car.  Merkurs can be made reliable, but they will need more upkeep than a typical Japanese car of the same era.  If you are the kind of person who wants a distinctive stylish, fast, comfortable, fun to drive car, and doesn&#146t mind giving the car the attention it deserves then I highly recommend it.  Lets keep these cool cars on the road.
