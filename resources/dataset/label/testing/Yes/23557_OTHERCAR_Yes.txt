                I bought my '93 NX 2000 back in a little over a half a year ago, and it has surpassed all my expectations.  I bought it for about $3600 and the only doubt I had in my mind, at the time, was the amount of miles it had on it; 136,000.  But I will tell you that I am surprised at the deal that I got.  So far,(keep your fingers crossed) nothing has gone wrong with it.  The only times it is in the garage is for routine maintenance.  I will definitely not complain about that.  
    
    What I really love about my NX 2000 is the fact that I am the only one that has one.  Sure, everyone drives a Neon or a Jetta, but I have yet to see another NX 2000 driving around.  I also love the look.  It is not too sporty but it is not dull either.  The T-tops are a plus and makes driving in the summer heat a blast.  
    
    There is not too much I hate about my car except that the size is a little compact.  I am about 5-8 and trying to fit sometimes is difficult.  Hauling other people around is also difficult since only groceries fit in the back.  Size seems to be the only drawback to this great car. 
   
   Driving this car is definitely a treat.  The two cars I owned prior to the 2000 were an Escort and a Reliant.  The NX 2000 is smooth, sometimes, and offers speed; which is fun.  The acceleration is not what it could be, but then again, I didn't buy a Mustang.  Long rides are also a pleasure.  I often drive two and a half hours on a Friday to see my girlfriend who goes to school in Philadelphia.  The ride is long, but all I do is crank up the radio and let the small, quiet, yet powerful engine do all the work.  
    
    The only people who I recommend drive an NX 2000 should be those looking for a good car, at a good price, and want to have a little fun in the process.  However, they should be relatively small and will to sit low to the road, which I think is quite a thrill
