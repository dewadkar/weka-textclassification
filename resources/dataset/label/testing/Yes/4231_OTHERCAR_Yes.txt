            I got this car used and have been driving it for 2 years now and I love it. I replaced the headliner for $150.00 because it was very dirty. I upgraded to 16" wheels from a 2000 Deville won on e-bay for $200.00 for the set. I choose Kumho Esta H rated tires from the tirerack.com for $52.00 each to improve the loose handling. I recently went on ebay and got a drivers seat from a Concours because I drive a lot and wanted the lumbar option. So far in two years other than brakes, a major tune up and fluid changes mechanically I have only replaced the motor mount for $100.00, replaced the starter for $100.00, put a new water pump for $360.00. I test drove a Concours 4.6 Northstar but like the 4.9 better. The transmission on the 4.9 is fun,it downshifts and goes all the time while very strong Northstar motor has a dead transmission that does not downshift. I would advise test driving both models first to see what model suits your taste. Dollar for dollar I don't think there is a better car than a 1994 - 1995 Sedan Deville with a 4.9 motor. You can get them for $2,500 - $5,000 on ebay all the time.
