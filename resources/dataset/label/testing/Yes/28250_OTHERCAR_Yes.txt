            I wouldn't give up my Durango for anything.  I purchased in in January of '99, and I haven't had any problems.  The cargo room is unbelievable.  I have transported full size video arcade games in  it with the seats down.  The third set of seats is a must for a family.  I test drove almost every SUV on the market early in 1999, and found nothing gave me the bang for the buck like the Dodge Durango.  Great power, every option you can imagine, and a 2nd A/C system for the rear seats.  <br>If I had one complaint, it would have to be the gas mileage (13-17 mpg), but thats about average for all the SUV's I looked in to.<br><br><br>
