            I've never been too big a fan of Infiniti's offerings. Sure, the first Q45 and J30  were intriguing cars, but I was too young to even be in the car market. Their models in recent years however haven't interested me as much, except for the seemingly better prices compared to BMW and Lexus. However, I've been looking the past year for a sporty, entry level luxury sedan to replace my trusty 200SX coupe (see old review) and wouldn't you know it, the all new G35 was being introduced right around the time I was shopping.

At first I didn't even want to consider the Infiniti. I figured I couldn't get a good deal on a newly designed model, and I am mostly a "value" shopper. If I was gonna pay sticker, then I wanted more prestige than Infiniti offered me. But after testing the Lexus IS and Mercedes C240/320 I decided to give it a shot.

The first thing that impressed me about the G35 was the performance specs for the price. For about $35,000 (Premium Package) you're getting a powerful 260hp engine along with all the goodies like Bose CD changer, sunroof, leather, dual climate, and power seats, alloys, etc. The engine is more than enough for a car of this size; simply put, you can fulfill the need for speed easily in this car.  This is a true sports-sedan, unlike the previous poser that Infiniti offered, the G20.

The car wasn�t as cutting edge in the looks department to me once I saw it up close.  However, the front and windshield are slanted in an aerodynamic look. I went for the �Aero� package which included an attractive spoiler and more pronounced body.  

The interior, as is with a lot of cars in this class now, has a very modern feel to it.  Plenty of silver and gray gives the car that metallic industrial feel.  Which is pretty much going to either please you, or turn you off.  I understand they do offer a wood trim package, but I couldn�t really see that looking good in this car.  There is an attractive clock and temperature settings in the center dash, as is typical with Infiniti.  I�d call the overall interior �different� than what I�m used to, but it appeals to young adults like myself ( I think).

Overall, the car handles fantastic.  It�s a comfortable ride but IMO geared towards performance.  I handled the toughest of curves quickly with ease, and the steering was very responsive.  The car doesn�t ride as smooth as the Mercedes, but handles better than the IS.  Great handling + 260 horsepower = loads of fun. Let me stress that again. LOADS OF FUN! I don't have a family to drive around yet, but if I did this car would seem like a nice compromise. Hey, it's got 4 doors and is roomy enough in the back for small children to non-obese adults. Plus the cabin noise was quiet for a 260 hp engine.  Opt for the cherry red, and your friends will think you're having a mid-life crisis. Yes, this car does look fast too, but it backs it up.
 
If they offered a manual transmission, which I was told they eventually will, I�d like this car even more.  It would be a nice step up for those who love the manual transmission Nissan Maximas.  Be as it is, this sedan has been a thrill to drive while being luxurious enough to keep me comfortable.  Negotiating wasn�t easy on this car as it was brand new; in fact there wasn�t much at all.  I walked away paying roughly $800 under the sticker price. However my car was pretty much loaded, except for navigation and the optional bigger wheels. You should be able to get a still nice car for $30K or so without all the extras.  I�ll probably feel differently by the end of the year when Nissan is offering their usual monster rebates, but for now this car is keeping me all smiles.
