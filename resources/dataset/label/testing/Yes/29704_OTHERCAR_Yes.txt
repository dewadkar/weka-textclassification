              We bought our 1997 Legacy when we were four months pregnant with our first child.  We had some necessities in mind when shopping for our new car: automatic, all-wheel drive, air-conditioning, cruise control, four doors, good steering, to name a few.  I didn't have these with my small hatchback.  Also, we are tall.  The back seat was made with us in mind.  We've taken 8-hour trips and been comfortable the whole time.  And a very quiet ride!

  We wanted a Subaru because of their reputation.  We knew we'd be happy with the quality (plus a magazine that reviews many consumer items rated it very high).  We have not been disappointed.

  Our car was previously owned by a man who knew quality plus took very good care of this vehicle.  This is a beauty of a car.  

  My only complaint: baby car seats should be in the middle back.  However, there is a 'hump' so it isn't possible.  I tried her seat there, but the hump is small, so the seat wiggles a lot.  We moved her back to the side.  

  Otherwise, we couldn't be happier with our Subaru.  The handling is great, responds well, good gas mileage and is a beauty to look at.
