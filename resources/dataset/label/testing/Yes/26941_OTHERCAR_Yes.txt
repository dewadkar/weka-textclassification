            If you are looking for a good reliable car, ur search is over. The Toyota camry has everything. It is not very expesive like bmw's and mercedes benz but still is very luxurious this is a rather amazing car for the money you spend. Besides the smooth ride, this car looks very nice, and u get a lot of good mileage on it, and all the options are quite conveniently placed. My family haw owned one for ten years and just tradedit for a new camry. This car is unbelievble. I am usually not much into japanese cars, but this one changed my views. The car is quite cheap, at a measly 20-25K. The car is easily maintained, and it is very reliable. this car will, without a doubt, last you for years and years. I suggest that u look into one and consider getting one. YOu will not be disappointed.
