            I can't say enough good things about my 1997 Nissan 4X2. After my previous car, a Nissan Sentra finally gave up the ghost I decided it was time for my first NEW car. After a but of looking I decided to stay with Nissan, but Upgrade to a Pick-up Truck. Halloween Night 1997 I went out and came home with on heck of a treat. A Super-Black 4X2 Pick-up. I looked at 4X4's and King Cabs and all that nonsense, but I couldn't justify the additional expense. I never go off-road and it doesn't snow much in Puget Sound so 4-WD was an unnecessary luxury. In the last 3 years I have put almost 60,000 miles on my truck and the only work it's needed is regular oil changes. There's no doubt at all in my mind that I will put 200,000 miles on the truck before I get around to looking for another. I commute with it almost daily, and haul lumber in the bed and tools in the after-market tool box I installed. I average 22 miles/gal. So the fuel economy is excellent. <br><br>
