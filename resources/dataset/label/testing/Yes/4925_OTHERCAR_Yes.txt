            I purchased my Tundra SR-5, 4x4 in May of 2003.  After months of research, I narrowed the field down to two trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado, and the Toyota Tundra.  I started my search with a definite bias toward the Chevrolet; I had always been a Chevy man. My previous truck had been a 1986 Chevrolet Silverado; I got 235,000 miles out of the vehicle, but did have to nurse components, water pumps, fuel pumps, starters, alternators, quite often. My dad has it now and it is still getting up for work everyday.  

However, Now that I am older, fatter, and just too tired to do the maintenance myself  I was looking for a minimum maintenance truck.  The final tumbler that clicked me over to the Tundra actually came from driving ten used vehicles.  I drove three Tundras, all with over 80,000 miles, and seven Silverados.  The Silverados mileage ranged from 41,000 to 114,000.  The difference between the two sets of trucks with significant mileage was so stark that for me no further trading was necessary.  All three Tundras were quite and rattleless; handling was tight, without the roll you often get with higher miles.  My experience with the Silverados was different.  Several, not all, had significant rattles. Two had a loud whine in the rear gearbox, and all had loose handling.  The acceleration was not as quick as the Tundra or as the newer Silverado.  The Chevrolet's did have a more spacious, comfortable interior, but not quieter.  It appeared to me to be coming down to a choice of fit, function, and durability versus comfort and a quality interior.  Coupling the durability with the Toyota resale, I was ready to buy.

For reference, I purchased a 2003 SR5, American Edition, V8 Tundra.  The truck has four wheel drive, extended cab, four doors, and towing package.  The American Edition added a bed liner, chrome step rails, fog lights, doorsill protectors (which I really like) and the American edition decals.  

Interior:  

Pros: The ride is near absolutely quite; it is hard to believe it's a truck.  The single disk CD player has four speakers and I find the sound excellent, not too boomy or muffled. The button arrangement is very easy with big buttons for AM, FM, Tape, Disk, nicely done. All the gauges are easy to see, with front and back lighting at night.  The vision is excellent from all windows and the mirrors have good range. I have not noticed any large blind spots. The air conditioning is fantastic. I rarely have to turn it past the first or second notch, and that's in Alabama, this also keeps the noise down. The seat has a flip down console that I like as an armrest, but not as a CD storage.  

Cons: I would certainly agree with other reviewers on the bench seats; Toyota has a ways to go to catch up with deep understanding of GM and Ford when it comes to the American Big Man hiney.  I am not pleased with the comfort or choice of the cloth for the seats. It does not appear to be easy to keep clean. I have to be far too careful for a truck.  If I have any regret on this vehicle, it was not getting the leather seats. The door panels are covered in the same material so if you have dirty jeans you cannot let your knees hit the side of the door.  There are a couple of other little nagging items I think Toyota could improve: the driver's seat belt buckle is too close for big guys. An average person would probably not have a problem but if you're big, you have to hunt for the buckle. The clock is mounted at the bottom of the center instrument console and is often blocked by glare. A power rear window would be nice, since you can't reach it without getting out of the truck.  The center seat flip down armrest & storage console is not deep enough to store CDs vertical. They have to lay flat which limits space.  The longer I keep the truck the more annoying this gets. Surely, Toyota understands that the majority of people that will buy new Tundra will have changed from cassette tape to CD. The console and the tape deck should go. They could better spend the dollars designing a center console only for CDs. 

Mechanical

Pros:  Man the V8 power is awesome.  Like a corralled rodeo bull waiting for the gate, it snorts just sitting at red lights. Acceleration to 80 is quite, and in about 8 seconds. I have the 17&#148 wheels so the ground clearance is really nice.  Thus far, I have not had any mechanical problems.  The four-wheel drive is capable of low and high speed. You can change from 2wd to 4wd high without stopping but you need to be less than 50 miles an hours.  To change to 4wd low you must stop and shift to neutral.  The change from 2wd to 4wd does seem to make a significant pop, but again I was told that was normal.  Handling is super. Turning radius is excellent for such a big truck. Doesn&#146t roll much. 

Cons: Perhaps the biggest con is the brakes.  Before buying, I had read several reviews noting weak brakes.  Well after owning for a few months,  I wouldn&#146t call them weak, but they definitely take some adjustment time.  I was trained to my GMC&#146s big master cylinder smooth braking. The Tundra brakes work like the Tundra acceleration &#150 short and sudden.  I believe if you have the truck fully loaded, you had better be wearing boots. 

Another thing I noticed is a slight change in engine loudness at about 1800 rpm.  It took me a while to accept that it was normal.  I finally spoke with other Tundra owners and the confirmed theirs was loud in the 1800-2000 rpm range as well. 

Gas mileage &#150 ok for big truck, by comparison; sucks by my personal scale. 

Paint - Trim

Pros:  Flawless

Cons: None

In closing, I would definitely buy a Toyota again. I would change a few things if I bought a new truck. Don't know if I'd pay for the extra(wink wink) cab. So that gorgeous thing I left the lot with hasn't quite turned into a pig yet, but I do now realize that the heavens did not just open up and rain Tundra&#146s onto every distributor in the country.  There clearly are some nagging inconveniences with the interior design, it is quiet, but could be quieter.  So for now, I am newly wed with this truck, but the honeymoon is over. I am looking forward to how things go over the long haul. 

Update: 10/29/03 5700 Miles - My check engine light is on, do not know why yet. Will status. 

Update: 01/08/04 9700 Miles - Check engine light codes read - loose gas cap.... yeap. Tightened and light reset, No problems at all since then. No rattles yet, slight knock on very cold day starts for about 10 seconds, watching.
