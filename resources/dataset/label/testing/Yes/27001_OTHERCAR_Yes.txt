            I used this camera pretty extensively for about 3 months before my boss stole it from me. Well, that's the bad news...the good news is I got to replace it with a C-2000 :) 

The 450 is one of the better point-and-shoot style cameras out there, offering a good range of features, image quality and functionality. At the time, I was considering a Nikon Coolpix but had good experiences with 2 other previous Olympus cameras so I decided to stick with the same brand.
Even though Olympus isn't much of a contender in the professional 35mm space, it's nice to see them dive into the digital arena with the first megapixel consumer-type camera, dedicated photo printers, etc.

The 450 is a &quot;prosumer&quot; camera -- it's for advanced consumers. Don't believe anyone who says it's a &quot;pro&quot; camera. The only &quot;pro&quot; digital cameras are the Kodak DCS series and the Nikon D1. 

<b>ERGONOMICS: 3</b>
The 400/450 is a big improvement over the 340 series. Firstly, it has a real optical zoom lens and the zooming action works smoothly and reasonably quickly. The zoom rocker switch is located by the shutter release and though it's easy enough to use, I would prefer to have it at the back of the camera and use my right thumb. This lets you zoom while keeping your finger on the shutter release at all times. All cameras should be designed to keep your index finger ready for the killer shot and not futzing around with zooming. I like the sliding cover on/off mechanism, but the lens needs to retract and position itself more quickly. One other gripe I have is the built-in flash. You have to flip it up with your finger to activate it. How incredibly lame! What is the point of having a camera that is supposed to be auto exposure, but yet doesn't pop up the flash when needed? Olympus, please, just design it so it's always available, flush with the rest of the camera body. 

The shooting cycle time is acceptable -- much better than previous models. When you're shooting with the LCD off, the standard setting on Olympus cameras is to briefly display the image then shut it off. I wish there was a way to keep that image on longer or push a button to keep it on until I decided to shut it off. For many people, digital cameras are still a novelty and it's nice being able to show them the image instantly instead of having to turn off the machine then switch modes. 

The menu systems and buttons are so-so. I really don't like the tiny rectagular buttons which are bad for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they're tiny and hard to push and secondly, they don't have a solid feel so it's often hard to tell if you've actually pushed it. Let's try to have 3-4 main buttons and a thumb control dial to cycle through modes and options. That's a proven design in the SLR world, why not use it here??

One other note: for anyone buying *any* digital camera, please invest in some rechargeable NiMH batteries or else you'll run through regular AA alkalines in 2 seconds flat. The 450 is no exception. Olympus, maybe you should just include them in the first place??! 

<b>IMAGE QUALITY: 4</b>
No complaints here. Of all the digital cameras I've seen and used, Olympus tends to deliver very even and consistent results. I've tried to &quot;trick&quot; the metering systems by shooting in mixed lighting situations containing shadows, natural light, indoor light, etc. and I would say I'm quite impressed. They're not as good as a professional SLR, but they impress me more than your standard point-and-shoot camera. Though the image quality is great, I wouldn't use them for print. You really need at least 2 megapixels for decent prints, so you may be disappointed if print is the final destination of your images. For email attachments and web sites, this camera is more than adequate.

One thing you should be aware of: the LCD image on the camera tends to be a bit lighter than the image when you download it and display on a CRT monitor. Very slight difference tho.

<b>IMAGE TRANSFER: 3</b>
There are a couple of ways to transfer images from camera to computer. I've used both the Camedia floppy adapter and the regular serial cable. My experience is that both methods are slow and klunky, esp compared to the sexy USB interface. If you're using Windows NT, you'll have to go out of your way to use the Camedia adapter; the driver doesn't come with the camera and I had to download it from some Olympus site in the UK(!) Geez, let's have some organization here. How crazy!

You get pretty boring software that sort of helps you organize your images, but it's pretty useless. If you're serious about organizing your images, spend your money on software from Extensis or Cumulus.

<b>OVERALL: 3.5</b>
The 450 is a great value. You get a solid machine that will deliver impressive images in a package that is pretty easy to use and small. I like the form factor and hope Olympus continues to refine the design.<br><br>
