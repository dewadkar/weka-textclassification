            Want a car that is dependable and one you can trust?  Then the Camry is the car for you.  I have had my camry for 2 years now.  I am constantly driving and put the car to its test.  I have put 80,000 miles on it and it still is driving like it did when I got it two years ago.
Camry's are very reliable and have great gas mileage.  From personal experience traveling so much on the road,I have found that I have to fill the tank up less and enjoy the smooth ride.  Each year toyota is doing so much to improve the quality of their cars.  
My time driving my camry has been truly fun.  The car is reliable and is just great!!!
