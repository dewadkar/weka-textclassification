            Let me just say that this is a fantastic camera.  Most recently retailers have begun selling it for under $100 which makes this a can't miss deal.  First of all, lets do a rundown of what this is:

The Sony Cybershot DSC U10 was the first subminiture camera on the market that allows 1.3 megapixes of quality on a package the size of a large pack of gum.  Storage is Sony's memory stick media (more on the virtues of this later).

Slide open the front cover to reveal a lense and flash.  The cover is spring loaded so it slides open and closed with a clean "snick-snick".  The cover opens easily in your pocket so make sure you get the optional belt case or just leave it hanging around your neck with the lanyard.

A side hatch opens to reveal both batteries (AAA NiMh rechargables) and the Memory Stick slot.  On the back a small rubber cover that swings out of the way reveals the mini USB slot where you can upload your pics to your USB port on your computer with the included cable.

PERFORMANCE:

As stated, the Sony DSC U10 does it job well for what it is: an entry level camera that can also serve as a backup.  For an entry level camera, this camera has a host of features to keep you busy.  There are various modes which help in specific situations.  My favorite is the night mode, which allows you to take a picture of a subject in front of a dark background.  What it does is it takes the picture with no flash so the dark background gets captured and then fires off the flash to get the subject.  There are also Black and White and Sepia tone modes too.

This camera has a few quirks.  If you want pictures without red-eye, you MUST use the red-eye reduction, which will increase the shutter lag you will have on this camera.  Also, most people find that the display is too small.  I agree as you cannot even tell if a picture is out of focus from a display that small.  Another thing, the autofocus is hit or miss sometimes.

During the day and bright sunlight, photographs turn out brilliant and clear.  This is where this little camera shines.  The best pictures you will get is outdoor shots of scenery and people.  However, at night the flash tends to be hotter that it should be and closer subjects get blown out.   Taking pictures of bright neon lights or areas with lots of outdoor lighting tend to be okay.

And, of course, shutter lag and powerup time.  First of all, this little camera is only a 1.3 MP machine.  So you don't need to have such a huge capacity memory stick for it.  As a matter of fact, when you use anything larger than a 32Meg size stick, the camera slows down an every opportunity.  Powering up takes longer (more than 4 seconds sometimes)and recording images takes longer (which translates to shutter lag in between shots).  Now this is a strange quandry now, since the higher megapixel count cameras are out in force now (3.2MP and above) the smaller capacity memory sticks have come down in price.  Good for us guys who own the DSC U10, since we need the smaller ones anyways.  Don't even think about putting a 128Meg memory stick in the DSC U10, it's too slow and your money will be wasted.

In summary, its really an entry level camera.  But not a bad one to have as long as you know it's limitations.
