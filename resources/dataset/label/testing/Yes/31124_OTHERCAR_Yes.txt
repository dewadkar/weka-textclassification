            This 7-series BMW is one of the most luxurious car on the road today.  The 740i i own is very fast and smooth.  Its so quiet at speeds of excess of 90 it feels like its going less than 40 mph.  This car is a serious performance luxury sedan.  It has features such as automatic tire pressure control which monitors the tire pressure as well as tuning the transmission to a deflation in pressure.  The 7-series also can be had in a special protection model.  This model features heavy pane bullet proof glass all around as well as a light armor body which is bullet and bomb proof.  This vehicle has a load of standard features such as leather seating, power everything including tilt/telescoping steering, wipers, rear sunshade.  The 14-speaker stereo system contains a tweeter and a midrange in ever door and 4 woofers in the rear shelf. It also has Digital Sound Processing which is one of the best on the market, you're in for the sound of your life.  When I first sat in the car and the stereo was going on low I though the sound was coming from somewhere outside, it is very, very accurate.   I would recomend this car to anyone.  Everywhere I go everyone compliments me on how nice my car is !!  Also the optional 18&quot; wheels are very good looking and speak highly of you.  The Z-Rated Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 lo-pros tires are very sticky.  Cornering is very sharp.  I have yet to encounter a turn where the tires have started to squeel and I have tooken turns doing 50 mph.  The standard dynamic stability Control (DSC) is the main thing that keeps you planted firmly on the road.  It individually brakes each wheel that is starting to lose traction or is locking up, it works with the ABS system.  There is also an on/off switch if you want to show that kid with the Mustang on ur block who can do a bigger burnout.    <br><br>
