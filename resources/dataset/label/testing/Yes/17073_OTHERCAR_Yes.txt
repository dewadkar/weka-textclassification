            I bought the Chrysler Concorde because I wanted a safe, roomy, and powerful car.  I really love the pep of the 200+ horsepower engine I got with the 24-valve version.  The large wheels and the cab-forward design really give the car great handling.
I've had three problems with the car, one of which wasn't handled well by the dealer.  That was a problem with a warped brake rotor.  The dealer did a lousy resurfacing job that had me back with the same problem within a month.  I eventually took it to a local garage that was able to do it right.  The other problems were with door hinges and a transmission knock - both of which were taken care of with one visit to the dealer.
The Concorde rides very smoothly and is almost too easy to push over the speed limit.  The overdrive keeps the RPMs very low at highway speeds, helping to keep the engine noise down. The cruise control maintains a steady speed even over hilly terrain.
Again, one of my reasons for buying the car was roominess.  I am over six feet tall and find that many cars don't have enough head and leg room.  I recommend this car to other tall drivers who are tired of being cramped behind the wheel.<br><br>
