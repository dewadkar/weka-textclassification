            This is not my car, but I ride in it everyday and I have driven it a few times too.  It is my girlfriend's father's honda.  He loves it and so do I.  I catch a ride with him to school everyday and I think that it is an awesome car.  It is very comfortable and quiet.  I fall asleep in it everymorning that's how comfortable it is.  It doesn't rattle and the shocks don't squeak as do some other SUV's.  It looks cool too.  It doesn't look like most other SUV's.  It had it's own look until toyota stole it's look with the rav4.  The CR-v is neat too because it is a smaller SUV.  Most SUV's are big and bulky, but the CR-v is relatively small.  You can fit 5 people comfortably in it, but 4 is optimal seating.  The trunk space has something to be desired however.  It is small too.  <br><br>
