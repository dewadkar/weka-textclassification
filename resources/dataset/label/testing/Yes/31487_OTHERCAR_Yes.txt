            After struggling for years to use up that last two or three shots on the roll of film I discovered the digital camera world while visiting my cousin in Hawaii.  She has some old clunker that probably costs a fortune but she needs it in her work as a parole officer so she needs a good quality camera.  

I just wanted a camera that i could snap a quick pic to use in my landscape designs without wasting an entire roll of film for two or three snaps.  

I had tried the Polariod route but the pic quality really sucked when I scanned it into my design software package.  AOL offered the Afga one day and i &quot;snapped&quot; it up!  The package came complete with everything you needed except instructions.  The instructions were in the software and you had to view them thru the computer but I finally figured out what I needed.  

I couldn't be happier with the quality of the photos I have received and the ease of using the camera.  It does have it's downfalls but I don't think there is a product anywhere that is perfect for all.  

The size is a little bulky but I have small hands and once in a while I find the darn thing already turned on when I remove it from my camera bag because of the ease of the on/off knob on the side of the camera.  

For my use and for the price I don't think I could find a better deal.  Perhaps if I were using it daily I would look around for something different, but I love the little guy. <br><br>
