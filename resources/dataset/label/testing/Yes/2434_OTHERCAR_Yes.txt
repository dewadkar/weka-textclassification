            There is no doubt that the Mitsubishi people have tried to catch the car buyer's attention in this SUV-loaded market.  Departing from the complete redesign of the 2001 Montero, they have managed to come with some great exterior and interior enhancements that will make most buyers happy.  Ever since I was working in two foreign countries where the road conditions could be best described as impassable, I have been a fan of the Montero.  No matter how many other defaults that may be found on this SUV, I will admit that the earlier models my companies had handled well the road.  No wonder that I have selected to test-drive the <b>2002 Mitsubishi Montero</b> to see what has and has not changed.  This SUV is one of the most popular trucks I have encountered in most foreign countries I have been to.  It's sold in more than 170 countries where it's used as the workforce of some governements and international organizations.

<b>How did my test-drive go on this SUV?</b>

My tester was the XLS model.  I took it for a spin on the new 180 freeway junction connecting two major freeways of the Central Valley of California.  I had no problem fitting in my long frame.  I had enough legroom and headroom. If was attracted by the exterior looks, I immediately fell in love with its interior improvements.  The XLS has some great feature standards just like the other model the 2002 Mitsubishi comes with.  I have enjoyed the Ecsaine seat trim which is kind of a suede material.  I could not resist the touch of the leather-wrapped steering wheel.  I did not need anybody to tell me that this was an improved vehicle that offers the XLS and Limited models with the very best features usually reserved for luxury sedans.  The 2002 has all the refinements and options you would find on any Infinity vehicles.  Some of the other features include Mitsubishi/Infinity AM/FM/CD audio system, power antenna, power sunroof and limited-slip differential.  Sitting in the rear seats, my kids had a blast playing with the rear air-conditioning and heating system.  This feature is available with the touring package.

<i>Was I satisfied with the features and performance of this SUV?</i>

Well, I was hoping to have better air conditioning.  I turned it on full blast.  I still felt hot.  Maybe it was due to the fact I was test-driving the SUV in a 103-degree temperature.  Only the brave car enthusiasts want to be out on such a day!  Besides that observation which I mentioned to the salesperson, I had no major complaints.  I truly enjoyed the enhanced passenger safety on this SUV.  The three-point seat belt and height-adjustable head restraint have been added to the second row center seating position.  Right behind me, my daughter was making all kinds of plans of what she could place in the driver's seat-back pocket.  I also enjoyed the new windshield shade band on the 2002 Mitsubishi.  To protect oneself against the rays of the sun in the Valley, one can make good use of this feature.  Also, my visibility was greatly improved.  I felt as comfortable in the Mitsubishi as in any of the following vehicles:  the Honda Pilot, the 2002 TrailBlazer, the 2002 Isuzy Axiom and 2002 GMC Envoy.  I should not forget the 2002 Buick Rendez-vous.  

When merging into lanes, I did not hesitate to press on the accelerator.  The truck was very responsive for the most part.  The 2002 Mitsubishi is powered by a 3.5-liter SOHC 24-valve V6 engine designed such that the power starts building low in the rev range and peaks early to produce a great responsive punch.  More than anything, it's the image that is attached to this vehicle.  Fellow road users were checking it out as they have sped down the freeway to run side by side with us.  The smoothness and quietness of the engine are the result of the liquid-filled engine mounts, a single serpentine accessory drive belt and large-diameter, low-rpm cooling fan.  Every part and accessory is so tight under the hood.   

<b>Who would benefit the most from the 2002 Montero and what types of warranty are available?</b>

I can see any government officials, respectable families, upward mobile users and parents who have to drive their kids from one soccer game to the next baseball practice.  If you invest in a Mitsubishi, you can take advantage of the three-year or 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, five-year or 60,000-mile powertrain warranty and seven-year or 100,000-mile anti-corrosion/perforation limited warranty.  Mitsubishi provides 24-hour roadside assistance and free towing on all warranty-related repairs during the first three years or 36,000 miles.

As I returned from my test-drive, I unfortunately found a young couple who brought their Montero in for service.  They were arguing with the service rep about the headache they have been having their truck.  They could not realize what was wrong with it.  I quickly followed the salesperson to the office where I got back some of my info and other belongings.  My kids and I exited through another another door pretending I did not hear any of the earlier comments.  While I did not seem to find any problems with my tester, I can't guarantee that these trucks are problem-free.  

<b>Recommendations</b>

Make sure the service department is not hostile and will answer your questions.  Make sure you use all the warranties on the truck.  A colleague of mine who owns a Montero thinks it's the greatest SUV in the world.  He never had any problems with his.
