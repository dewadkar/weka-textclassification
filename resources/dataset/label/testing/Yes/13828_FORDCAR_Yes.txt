            What can I say about my Contour SE Sport ?  It is a BALL to drive, I love it !  It is the love I have for this car that keeps me from getting rid of it, thought it has a tainted history.

I do a lot of driving.  About 85% of my driving is MAJOR highway driving.  I drive anywhere from Washington D.C. to Pittsburgh, PA, to Buffalo, NY, to Boston, MA.  In the last two years, I have put over 47,000 miles on my Contour.  AND, I have had the car serviced every 2,500 - 3,000 miles.  The most important and least expensive thing you could do for ANY vehicle.

My 98 Contour SE Sport, has the FULL SE package, and the FULL SPORT package.  I have seen a lot of these cars in the New York area and they are always MISSING something.  They have the Body Cladding, but not the spoiler.  Or they have the Spoiler, but not the Body Cladding.  I even went shopping for the SVT version, and I know all of the differences between these two as well.  My Contour has all of the bells and whistles except for the Power Roof, Power Antenna, and Power Passenger Seat.  Traction Control was not an option for the 1998 model.  I do have the ABS system and the 15&quot; Alloy 6 spoke wheels that are given when you opt for the SE version.

What make this car so bad ?  I have had THREE (3) MAJOR problems with this car.  The first problem was the transmission.  I have the 4 speed Automatic.  At 30,000 miles, I had my Ford Dealer service it.  After the service, I drove it to Buffalo, NY.  After 250 miles of travel, the engine temperature rose to the letter &quot;L&quot; in the NORMAL range.  It is normally in the &quot;O&quot; letter area.  When I pulled off the highway, the transmission shifted very HARD and erratically.  I checked all of the fluids, which were fine and let the Contour rest for 30 minutes.  I was able to make the trip to Buffalo and back home, but it went back to the dealer the very next day.  They told me how the Contour runs hot.  I told them they were FULL of it.  After driving the car for 30,000 miles, I think I know how hot my car gets.  They checked over the Contour and found nothing.

The following week, I drove the Contour to North Carolina and the same thing happened, but it seemed that every time it happened, the mileage interval to cause the engine to overheat grew shorter and shorter.  Now the engine would overheat in 100 miles of travel.  But, this was the kicker....  On my way BACK to NY, I got stuck in STOP and GO traffic.  The engine temperature went back to NORMAL &quot;O&quot; during this period of time.  This reconfirmed to me that the problem was definitely in the transmission.  When I got back to NY, the Contour went back to the dealer.  I wrote them a TWO PAGE story of my encounters and documented everything that happened.  They determined that the OVERDRIVE CLUTCH had failed in the transmission.  A week later, I got my Contour back with a newly factory rebuilt transmission direct from FORD.  I was happy my Contour was back to normal.

Second item.  The Air Conditioning compressor got very noisey after the transmission was replaced.  It took the dealer an entire week to get the right parts for the compressor.  It seems that there was an error on someone's part, that kept my dealer from getting the correct part.

And now, recently, I had to have BOTH catalytic converters replaced.  Probably due to the overheating from the transmission problem.

All of these repairs have been done under the warranty at my Ford Dealer, and I have been very satisfied with the work they have done.  I just wish it wouldn't take so long for them to do it.  I also purchased the 6yr/72,000 mile Primo Warranty from FORD as well.  Don't buy any warranties from anyone OTHER then the dealer you purchased your car from, and make sure the warranty is written by the vehicles MANUFACTURER.

The car rides the same as the day I got it.  I get 20 - 25 MPG in the city and 30 - 35 MPH on the highway.  This highway gas mileage is also with a fully packed car and using Sunoco 89 octane gasoline.

At 40,000 miles the Firestone GTA radials had just about had it.  I could have ran on them for another 10,000 miles but I didn't want to take a chance with the winter coming up.  I replaced them with Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus (available at COSTCO) and surprisingly, the Contour's ride didn't change, it got BETTER.

If the transmission proves to be better than the original, I think I will keep this car and put another 100,000 miles on it.  It is very fun to drive, and it is a very comfortable car for me.
