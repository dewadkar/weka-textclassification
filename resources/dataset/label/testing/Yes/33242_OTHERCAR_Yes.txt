            I have owned several Digital cameras, Nikon 990, Olympus 2500 & 3000, Fuji
4900z, + a few others.
I really do like the ability to use a digital darkroom and wanted to be able
to give up film entirely.
None of these cameras would allow me to do that.  Mainly shutter lag and
slow auto focus, not picture quality, being the main things that limit these
fine picture takers.
I really wanted a Canon D-30 or a Fuji S1 but just couldn't afford one.
I bought the E-10 about 2 weeks ago.
The best thing I can say without going into all of the well thought out
features is that you totally forget you are using a digital camera.  It
looks, feels and performs like a 35mm camera with digital film.  I can't
think of a better way to explain it.  When you half press the shutter it
snaps into focus instantly and fires as soon as you press the rest of the
way, even in relatively low light.  It even has a simulated shutter/film
advance sound to let you and your subjects know the shot has been taken.
The zoom is manual so you can instantly set the composition without waiting
for the motor.  The viewfinder is bright because it's TTL optical and you
can see the shutter speed and aperture in the finder.  The LCD on the top is
like the one on my Nikon SLR, it's even backlighted.  It really makes it
easier to set functions without using menus.
I bought a 96MB CF and it holds 51 at the highest resolution ( the included
32MB smartmedia holds 17), 2240 x 1680 and second highest jpeg compression,
1/4.0, which seems to be a great compromise for file size vs. quality.  The
batteries are also just about completely dead after these two cards are
full.  I like the fact that it uses, not included though, 4 AA NiMH's.  I
don't see the need for the expensive large battery pack as I have 3 sets of
AA's.
The picture results seem much more detailed than lower resolution 3
megapixel cameras.  You won't see a great deal of difference on screen until
you zoom in.
The real benefit to the extra resolution is when you crop the picture it
still remains sharp and detailed.  With the other cameras I have used you
have to be careful when cropping if you want to make a print larger than 4 x
6.
The lens is really sharp and fast at f2.0-2.4.  It only goes 35-140mm but
the 1.45x will put it out to 203mm @ f2.4 and, from what I have read,
without any loss of quality.  So that would be a lot of money just for the
lens in the 35mm world.
One side note, like a really sharp lens on a 35mm, on people shots it may be
too sharp.  I applied a little blurring before showing my wife and
Mother-in-law their photos.
I am going to buy the 1.45x teleconverter  and there is a really good chance
I will not go back to film.
The only thing I am disappointed in is the noise at ISO 320.  I did read
that there is a photoshop plugin that will eliminate it but I can't remember
where I read it.
Will this satisfy my desire to have a digital interchangeable lens SLR? Yes,
for now.  It is, in my opinion, more worth the price than the Canon D30 or
Fuji S1. But I am rationalizing here.  If I could afford the Canon or Fuji,
I'd get it, but if you are like me and want to leave film behind for under
$2000, the E-10 is the best you can find.
