            For a long time Jeep has been known as one of the best SUVs for the money.  When I got my first car, I had been hoping for a Jeep Cherokee.  When I went out to the garage one night, and there was a Green 95 Cherokee Sport sitting in there, I almost fell over.  The car is wonderful.  In the three years that I have had mine, I have yet to have a major problem with the engine or anything else on the car for that matter. 

The inline 6 4.0 liter engine is one of the best that money can buy.  Inside there is room enough to feel like you are driving in a spacious car, but with the power that the 4 wheel drive Jeep puts out, you know that you are in a high powered SUV, with amazing towing capacity.   

The factory stereo system in the 95 Jeep Cherokee leaves a little to be desired, but at the affordable cost, you can easily manage to put your own in.  The 4 wheel drive capabilities make the Jeep one of the most popular cars on the road today.  It can explore terrain almost anywhere and be on the road in almost any driving conditions.
