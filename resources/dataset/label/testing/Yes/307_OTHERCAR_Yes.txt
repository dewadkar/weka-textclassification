            I am usually amused by the way Nissan figures out the names for its cars.  If you look too deeply, you always find that there is a hidden meaning under it.  Not necessarily something that meant anything to the CEO or had something to do his son's birthday, but I think they are always pushing the names to indicate their intended market.  With their not so expensive sports-ute, Nissan targets generation X as its main audience -- but than you could tell that by just considering its sporty overall outlook.  With its good looks, and reasonable price, the Xterra has been such a success so far that they have upped the production for next year by about 50k.

The Nissan looks quite distinctive for a 4-wheeler -- first of all the height of the car is raised right after the front seats.  This was obviously done to have more room in the back, but it does influence the look a lot.  The wheel-wells extend out at a point that is joined with a line that runs between front and back tires.  Two more horizontal slits (one black and rubbery) run in the mid section of the doors, a formula that is also followed by the skirts.  Other than that, the SUV lacks any useless ornaments that would make it look stupid anyway.  The rack that comes on top (part of their optional 1k package) also adds to the looks, but they do suit a purpose -- a basket that slips in front can hold your junk as you travel.  I think the rack is a good finishing touch in terms of looks, much like a wing on a sports car, and both these items do suit a purpose:&gt;

There are two versions of the Xterra, one is 4WD and the other 2WD.  I don't understand the logic behind owning a 2WD sports-ute, I really don't.  With this, there are also 2 engines available: a 4cyl that I think would be good for the 2WD.  And the 3.3liter V-6 that can punch 170HP.  But this isn't the kind of power that will scream in an SUV, because the car is too heavy.  So the acceleration on the Xterra is nowhere near fast, but it is reasonable.  I think its quite adequate for an SUV, which are unsafe for speeding anyway.  Besides, there is only so much you can pull without upping the mielage anyway -- which is around 16city / 19highway in this car.  My car is worse than that.

The Xterra rides smooth and sure.  However, there are some problems.  It does feel kind of rough when you hit the bumps.  Is this a serious off-road 4WD?  I think not, but than 99% 4WD never do go off-road.  So there is really no point to it anyway -- sports-ute is just a 4 seater truck that can haul more cargo than a car.  It should also give you the assurance you get from having power on all 4-wheels when driving through bad terrain, like in snow or heavy rain.  The Xterra manages that without any problems, except for the 2WD version.  The 2WD version of the Xterra gets 2 stars from me, for being the ugliest car on the road and not an SUV.

However, the 4WD version is a decent car deserving 5 stars just because it does what it set out to do.  It looks good, handles decent, and gives you the room and the control of a 4WD.  The other thing important for youngsters is the price -- the MRSP for the 4WD is around 20k.  However, don't let that fool you.  Add automatic tranny to that, and it goes up by 1k.  Get the power package which brings the inside controls up to date (power mirrors/windows/door, cruis, etc.) and there goes 1k.  And don't forget the rack on top, which looks too kewl to not have. So this car is going to cost around 25k, give or take.  For an SUV, that price is really not that bad.  In fact, for an SUV that actually looks good, I think its pretty darn good.<br><br>
