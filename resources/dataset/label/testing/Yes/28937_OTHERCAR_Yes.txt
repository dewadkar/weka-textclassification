            I don't own a Mazda 323, but I used to.  Last week I actualy bought this car's grandchild, a 2003 Protege, and while at the dealer I spotted a red 1994 323 hatchback on the used lot that looked almost exactly like the one I used to have.  Almost, because the dealer's car was the base model with no body side moldings and no wheel covers.

My 1994 323 was purchased in late 1994 as a used car with 11,000 miles on it.  I kept that car for four years and over 60,000 trouble-free miles.  At the end of its tenure in my family, my wife was driving it while I drove a 1996 Corolla.  When my Corolla was totalled in a head-on collision with a full-sized GMC pickup, I learned the value of airbags first hand and sold the airbag-free 323 the very next day.  Big mistake.

Before I talk about the car itself, I just want to say that in my 20 years of driving I have never owned a more reliable car.  Yes, I've had nicer cars, sportier cars, more economical cars, faster cars, quieter cars, and of course better looking cars, but at the end of the day, the 323 is the only one I can look back on and say was absolutely, 100% stone-cold reliable.  That car had exactly one problem in the entire time I owned it, and it was just a comfort item.  The AC condensor developed a leak right where the refridgerant hose connected.  At 58,000 miles Mazda covered the repair despite the car being 8,000 miles past the warranty.

Now to the car.  First off, other reviews here describe the 323 as fast and sporty.  They are wrong.  The 323, and I had the "big" 1.6 liter engine, only makes about 90 or so horsepower.  While 90hp is enough to move a 2300lb car just fine, it is NOT enough to be fast.  The car is not underpowered, but downshifts of the 4-speed automatic transmission were ALWAYS required to climb hills.  I also test-drove a 5-speed which was a little better, but still nowhere near to being "fast".

The engine was very pleasant though.  It was smooth, and while a bit noisy, it was a pleasing 4-cylinder growl that I've always liked in 4-cylinder Mazdas, my current Protege included.  The engine was a good match to the rest of the package, providing enough power to merge and cruise effortlessly (I drove my 323 cross-country - boy did I WISH for cruise control), while not enough to overcome the skinny 13 inch tires.  Of course, a small car witan efficient, low-powered engine should provide good fuel economy, and I averaged about 35MPG on the highway and close to 30MPG in city driving, WITH AN AUTOMATIC!  I hope my Protege eventually does that well, but somehow I don't expect it to.

The chassis was also very well matched to the engine.  The car handled well, with flat cornering and no surprises.  The light weight and good suspension setup provided a lot of fun when the road turned twisty, but overall limits were much lower than today's economy cars with their 15 inch tires.  Still, the car was very pleasant to drive and while not particularly fast around corners, was a lot of fun.

The 323 was a lightweight car, with thin door panels and not much sound deadening material.  Despite this, it wasn't a particularly noisy cruiser.  There was some wind and road noise, but the structure was very solid and I would only put it a notch or two less refined than today's economy cars.  My brand-new Protege isn't substantially quieter than that 323 was, only a little bit, though of course the Protege is at the noisy end of the current crop.

The interior was a delight.  Yes, the dash lacked a tachometer and the stock radio was useless, but the steering wheel was a properly thick three spoke design and the driving position was absolutely flawless.  The seats were fine for four hour or longer drives, and cross-country wasn't at all punnishing except for the above mentioned lack of cruise control.  Actually I'll be repeating that drive in my Protege next summer (also with no cruise), which should be a sort of deja-vu experience.

It is a simle interior, with crank windows, manual locks and manual remote mirrors, just like my new car.  Everything is simple, works like it is supposed to, and there are never any surprises.  Even the back seat was roomy enough for adults, at least on shorter trips, and the cargo area was large given the overall size of the car.  Even the cloth seat covering and the carpet was a cut above the usual economy car grade from 1994, and were easily as nice as those on the new Protege, though the hard plastics on the dash and door panels wouldn't cut it in 2003 on a Japanese car.

Perhaps the best compliment I can give to that Mazda 323 is that when I bought my new car last week, I tried as hard as I could to duplicate it in a new car.  Had the outgoing Protege been offered as a stripped 2-door hatchback, I would have bought it.  Despite an increase from 1.6 to 2.0 liters and from 13 inch to 15 inch tires, the new Protege has much in common with that old 323.  There is obvious progress, but the spirit remains the same.  A simple, honest car that will take you anywhere you want to go in comfort, and if you are willing, will put a smile on your face when the road turns twisty.  If my new one is even close to as good as my 1994 was, it promises to be a terrific car indeed.

How does the 323 stack up today as a used car?  Well there are two areas that I consider as glaring deficiencies.  First, the car uses those annoying motorized seatbelts which were the reason I sold mine.  Airbags saved my life in that 96 Corolla, so this is an important issue for me.  Still, very few other cars of the 323's generation had airbags either, so in that company, this is normal.

Second, the 323 is getting old now.  These are among the most reliable cars ever made, but the newest one is almost 10-years-old, so be careful when buying and be sure to have it inspected by a competent mechanic.

Once you find a well-maintained 323, you should be set for many more years of trouble-free driving.  Just be sure to replace the often overlooked components like shocks and struts, so you can experiene how the 323 was meant to perform.  Too many used car buyers just accept that an older car should have sacked-out, flabby handling and a rough ride.  Spend the money and your car will reward you with alike-new ride and sure, stable handling. 

Mazda may actually be bringing the 323 back, in a way.  The new for 2004 Mazda 3 is once again available as a hatchback, though only in loaded "S" trim.  How about a base model with crank windows?  I'd likely be first in line.
