            Like most consumers who live and drive in a city, I want a nice car with good handling, comfortable seating, a great stereo, a few perks like a sunroof, and a V-6 engine to navigate the highways.  Oh yeah--the car should be affordable, too.

The Mitsubishi Galant is the car for those who are ready to make the jump from practical (cheap) transportation to something with a bit more flash and substance.  I was driving a '93 Geo Prizm--inexpensive, reliable, an all-around good car.  After seven years, my wife and I decided I needed a new car, and after doing all the research--visiting websites, walking through several dealerships, reading reviews--we settled on the Galant.

I bought the GTZ model, which is almost identical to (and only $100+ more than) the regular Galant.  It has a few extra bonuses--leather seating, a slightly better stereo/CD player, sports-car suspension (really fun on turns), and a spoiler.  I'm thirty years old and I got some grief from my friends about the spoiler.  I like to think they're just jealous.  This car looks good, from the grille to the (okay) spoiler.

I live in Atlanta and have a twenty-five-minute commute in pretty heavy traffic.  While I occasionally had to redline my Geo in order to switch lanes or avoid stalls or wrecks, my Galant has no such problems.  The handling allows for easy lane changes, and while the automatic transmission takes a second to punch in, the V-6 gives smooth and swift acceleration.  The leather seats are comfortable and Mitsubishi threw in lots of little comfort perks, such as the power seating for the driver.  My seat is as adjustable as any hospital bed, and a lot more comfortable.  The stereo is excellent for anything from jazz to Pearl Jam.  I have four cupholders, leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear shift, a moonroof, excellent air conditioning (great for leather interiors in the summer) and simple-to-use interior lights.  And all this for $21,250.

I have a few quibbles, mostly minor.  The ride is quiet, but not as dead silent as some other midsize sedans.  The center armrest, mounted between the front seats and behind the gear shift, is a bit wobbly and feels plastic.  Once, parked in traffic, I reached for my CD case in my passenger seat and accidentally hit the armrest with my elbow--I thought I'd broken it.  The A/C and stereo controls are clearly marked, but they are also small--I suggest you get used to them before you first get into heavy traffic so you don't have to spend a few extra seconds peering at them to figure out how to change the station or turn on your defroster.  As I mentioned earlier, when I floor the gas pedal, the automatic transmission (no standard available on the Galant) takes a second or two to kick in.  But overall I love this car.  And I'll admit that I did not want a Honda or a Toyota because everyone else has one.

In five years, I plan to still be driving this car.  I've had my Galant for six months and still love just driving it to the gas station.  That to me is what owning a nice, good-performance car is all about.<br><br>
