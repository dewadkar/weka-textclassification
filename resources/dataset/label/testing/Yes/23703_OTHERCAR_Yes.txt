            I was in the market for a '93 Camry V6 LE/XLE. Not quite satisfied with the ones I was taking for test drives, my wife pointed me out the ES300 from the classifieds. We rushed to the nearest ES for sale and immediately we knew that this was the car we were getting. 

We ended up buying a one owner '93 ES300 with some 87,000 miles on it. Needless to say, with the age and mileage, we did not pay Lexus (high) price for the car. 

Our car is seven years old but it looks like it just rolled off the showroom. The only previous owner took great care of the car which shows everywhere starting the condition of the leather to the great sounding stereo.

The only two things that we had to fix was replace the engine mounting as well as replace the CV boots (done at the local Toyota dealer in order to minimize costs). For a car with this mileage and age (and the small price that I paid for it!!), I can live with minor repairs like these.

The funniest part is people are more surprised / impressed to see me driving a Lexus than when they see me driving my brand new Honda Accord V6 EX, which costs twice as much as my Lexus. The image that is associated with a Lexus is way higher than I had expected. So is the level of service when I go to the local Lexus dealership for routine services. 

This car seems quite dependable and reliable. I don't mind driving this car with over 100,000 miles in the middle of nowhere at midnight on I-20. In this matter, I better be right.

After 15,000 miles and twelve months, all I can say is that whether you want to call it a dressed up Camry or ES300, this car is simply remarkable. 

I was in the market for a Camry, bought the Lexus. I couldn't have made a better decision. I have always loved Toyotas, but this ol' Lexus has changed my perception about Toyota / Lexus. They truly know how to make cars.

Happy Motoring !!
