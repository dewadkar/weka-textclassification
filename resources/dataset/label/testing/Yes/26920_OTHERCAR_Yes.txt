            After 4 years in my latest mode of vehicluar transport, it was time to get a new vehicle.  So long black hooded, silver bodied compact car.  2 accidents and over 130,000 miles and my little car was ready to go.  

I began my research online and was going through all sorts of vehicles.  Everything from Nissan to Dodge.  My family had spent a better part of a decade in Toyota Camrys and I hadn't thought to even look at them.  &quot;Too expensive,&quot; I thought.  &quot;Not enough power for driving on the California Highways.&quot;  Boy, was I wrong.

I took a 1998 Toyota Camry LE out for a test drive and discovered that the power of the 4 cylinder offers more that enough power to accelerate up ramps and past vehicles.  The ride is incredibly smooth.  I was finding it difficult to keep myself within the speed limit due to the fact that you hardly feel the speed.  The fuel economy is very nice, and I love the rather large gas tank.  Fewer stops at the gas station is a wonderful thing in my opinion.  

When I was looking for a vehicle, I wasn't just looking for a car that can get me through for the next 3-4 years.  I wanted a car that would retain it's value.  When I trade in this vehicle, I want to have something of value to exchange.

Another thing that I was looking for was safety.  Now being in a larger car is a good start.  You're more visible and that's an important factor.  Driver and Passenger side airbags are key in this vehicle.  One thing that does take some getting used to is the 2 blind spots over the shoulders.  It's important that you check over your shoulders before changing lanes.  The mirrors do not catch everything.

Overall, this is a great vehicle.  I am thrilled with the purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
