            As the father of 2 girls under the age of 3, it was certainly time to trade in the sport sedan for something more practical - the dreaded minivan.  We live in Dearborn, Michigan (Ford country) so the obvious first choice was the Ford Windstar.  We narrowed it down to the Windstar and the Odyssey but the Honda was the clear choice.  We knew it was something special when we had to wait 2 hours to test drive it and 3 months for it to be built.

The engine and transmission are excellent.  There is no engine noise - period.  This is one van that handles like a car.  The clincher was the fold down rear seat in the back.  One person can handle it without a problem, which cannot be said about the rear seat in any of the &quot;Big Three&quot; minivans.  Also, seven people can ride in comfort for a long period of time.  Finally, it's a Honda!!!!!  They know what they are doing!  <br><br>
