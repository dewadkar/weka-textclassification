            We have the same feeling about our 02 Trailblazer LT - The looks and power are great...but the attention to detail is way off. Our SUV has 16000 miles on it and has been to the Dealership 3 times already. 

Cons - 1st we brought it to the dealership for a few things that I noticed were wrong...1 - The headliner was sagging behind the moonroof. 2 - The doorseal was sagging even if you pushed it backup - it sagged down in a day. 3 - The SUV shifted into A4WD all by itself...this was heard by a loud clunk (cant be good). The headliner was fixed with some velcro - seems to be ok. But the Dealership had to order a few parts for the other two problems...this leads to the next problem..the lack of 'Service' by the dealer - they told me that I have to keep calling parts to see when they arrived...I said "are you kidding me ?" Aren't you are supossed to call me when they arrive ?? "...what sense does that make ?? Have the customer call everyday ??? Then @ 8 months the passenger side headlight went out - already ?? - Brought to the dealer - they fixed it no questions..but this time the mechanic left a cordless drill under my hood and SHUT IT ??? Luckily no damage. Well now the Doorseal has been replaced - the 4WD switch and Computer were reprogramed (today). Hopefully that fixes those problems...but now I have noticed the driver front seat cushion is loose. Going to fix this problem myself. Hopefully ? More cons - The Gas Mileage - We are only getting 16mpg and we do all highway driving. I know its winter gas right now...but even in the summer we were only getting 18 mpg's.


Positives - The Bose Sound System is awesome - the in-dash 6 CD changer works great and the sound is truely 'amazing' for a 'factory' stereo. The Power - the engine makes great power at every RPM. Comfort - the seats are comfortable - even for my 6'3" frame. The passenger seatbelt does seem to lock the person in too often...next time I bring it to the dealer I will have them look at it.(I noticed 'TruckTrend' had the same problem with their Envoy and the dealer replaced the whole seatbelt mechanism. 
  
Overall I can say that my wife loves the look and the way the SUV drives in the snow...we have had a very snowy winter and the Trailblazer drives great...it has the traction lock rear so it drives really stable. As for the Fit and finish - Chevy needs to go back to the drawing board.....There are toooooo many "little" problems with this 32000 vehicle. This is a 'MUST' trade in vehicle in 2 years MAX. 

Thanks
