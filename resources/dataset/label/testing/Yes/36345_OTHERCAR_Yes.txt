            I purchased this vehicle in December of 1993 in New York. I have ALWAYS wanted a 4WD vehicle and since the Isuzu was the cheapest on the market, I went for it. Despite a few mechanical problems I have had with the vehicle, to this day, I still absolutely LOVE my Rodeo!

Here is a list of the mechanical problems I have had thus far:

- ABS brake failure (under warranty)
- Rear defroster failure (under warranty)
- Both front and rear brake drums required replacement.
- Both master and slave clutch cylinders failed. (this was very costly to repair)
- My left turn signal fails to operate on occasion. (I brought my Rodeo in to get this fixed while it was still under warranty, but they could not find the problem.)
- My odometer stopped working at 85,000 miles. (still have to get this fixed someday)

Other than these problems and the fact that this thing is a major gas guzzler (especially in 4WD), I truly LOVE my Rodeo and would recommend this vehicle to everyone!<br><br>
