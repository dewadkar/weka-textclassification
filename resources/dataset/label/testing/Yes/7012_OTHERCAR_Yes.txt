            Our growing family of 4 needed to upgrade from our 1989 Volvo 240DL wagon. We were looking for a roomy vehicle that could handle the snow well, navigate our unpaved driveway, tote our children plus friends around as well as cart back supplies and purchases from the store. I had previously leased a 1994 Nissan Pathfinder and had also rented a Jeep Laredo. The Landcruiser blows both of these competitors away. It handles and rides like a car, is extremely quiet, and is very,very comfortable. It is an easy car to drive around town, yet packs all the comforts when traveling distances. There is nothing we do not like about this vehicle. Because of the price you should be prepared to own this vehicle for 10 years. FYI-I originally was looking to purchase a used Landcruiser. However, certified preowned Landcruisers that are 3 years old are selling for the same price as they did when new in the Northeast!<br><br>
