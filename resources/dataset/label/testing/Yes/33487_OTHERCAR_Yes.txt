            I originally bought this vehicle for my wife, Donna, who wanted quality family transportation.  She was very disappointed after realizing that though very practical in most other areas, it had a very hard time at maintaining a cruising speed of more than 100 miles per hour.  Being the loyal husband that I am I decided it would be a fine Christmas present for her if I gave the engine a little &quot;warming up&quot;.  My first step was to install a turbocharger that I had laying around off of a scrapped Case 1270 farm tractor.  It required a little hood modification to make it fit, but the power gain was tremendous.  Unfortunately, that amount of forced air tended to bog the engine down because most of the induction parts on the van simply were not up to the increased airflow.  This caused me to look for a new cam, fuel injectors ... you get the picture. Finally for those difficult passing situations I had to drop a nitrous bottle under my kid's carseat.  Though the minivan is certainly not cool it can at least hold its own in today's modern driving world.<br><br>
