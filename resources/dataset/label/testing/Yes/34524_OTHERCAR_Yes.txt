            The 2000 Dodge Ram 3500 is great truck, for someone who does a lot of towing or hauling around.  My own truck, I tow a lot, for work and pleasure.  I have a 25 ft power boat, and the 3500 makes it look like its towing nothing.  For work I have to tow large trailers, for construction offices from job site to job site, the constant usage of the truck, and yet it still runs and pulls fine.  I believe the best part about the truck is the towing package.  

The inside their are so many options that you can get, heated leather seats, the club or quad cab, in my case, I have the club cab, which is great for kids or small luggage that can't get wet.  The large dash with easy to control switches, The in dash CD player (optional), the power locks, windows, tilting steering window.  The dash has large easy to read gauges.

Under the hood the Ram 3500 has a lot of power, with the duel wheels it has more power than it really needs, but is useful in the towing area.  The only down side of the hood is that the grill goes up with the hood, most times I hit my head on the grill.

Hope this report added some more info on the 2000 Dodge Ram 3500, and helps you in your chosing of a vehicle that suites your needs.
