                 When shopping for a new car, I went to many different dealers like Lexus, Cadillac, and BMW.  I really liked the Lexus LS430 and the BMW 5-series, but the BMW was a little clunky when driving it.  The Lexus was great, but I thought that it was a little to luxurious.  Nothing really caught my eye like the Mercedez Benz E-320.
     
     I was first looking at the C-class but it was way too small in the back.  Then the salesman showed me the E-320.  I had always dreamed of driving one of these so we immediately took it out on a test drive.  Right away, I noticed that the ride was virtually dead quiet.  There were so many features that took my heart with this one.  The steering wheel is equipped with controls to change the radio or CD player.  It can even answer and hang up the phone.  Previous to this car, I was driving a Chrysler Concorde.  The E-320 is nothing like anything I have ever driven.  I purchased it the next week and I couldn't have been happier with myself.  
     
     The Mercedez E-320 is one of the safest cars I have ever been in.  There are about twelve airbags in the entire car.  I have no fears of being hurt in this one.  The E320 is the safest car in its class compared to any of the BMWs or Lexus'.  The ride is so smooth even in the rain.  The car grips the road so well, you are able to do the speed limit on the highway without worrying about traction or skidding out.  It was a feature which you can activate called electronic skip protection.  It does wonders in the snow I have heard also with it.
     
     The E-320 is suprisingly quick.  It has a 3.2 liter V6 engine, but feels like a V8.  You don't need the V8 unless you need to get to 60mph in under 7 seconds.  You have the option of going automatic or manual.  If you put the shift into drive, there is room on both sides for up-shifting and down-shifting.  It is a real help if you want to pick up speed quickly.  The first day that I bought this, I went right to the highway.  I was doing close to 100 and it felt like I was only going about 35 because it was so smooth.  The only trouble is that it is incredibly easy to rack up tickets with a machine like this one.
     
     This car has great features to it.  It is difficult to elaborate on all of them because the owner's manual is so big and it would be just a lot easier for you to take some time to read it.  Here are a few of the more impressive features.  My favorite is the fact that there is an SOS system that will call and give someone your location in the event of an accident.  There is also a button you can press that will dial someone who will tell you exactly where you are and help you get to where you are going.  There is also a weather sensor so that when it rains, depending on how hard, the windshield wipers will automatically activate and set themselves to the correct setting and shut off when necessary.  You have complete access to adjusting your seat position and headrest and are able to set three different memory settings for the seat.  There is also an option to get heated seats if you desire, although I don't recommend it unless you live in a rather cold climate.  You have a great climate control that also has a carbon filter which comes in handy when going through tunnels in order to ovoid those harmful gasses.  You are able to set the temperature for both the driver and the passenger.  You have complete control of all four of the windows in the front seats.

     There are only a few things that need improvement on this car.  Because the backseat is so comfortable and spacious, the trunk is lacking in size.  You cannot use the trunk for many things.  Also, the option where you can open and close the windows from outside of the car is a little lacking also because it only works from an incredibly close range.  These two things won't bother you and this car is a great but.  I believe that it is worth the money and if you are ready for something that will bring you so much joy and pleasure in your life, the E-320 is exactly what you need.
