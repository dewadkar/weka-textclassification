            Those of you familiar with my 1995 Plymouth Neon troubles should now rejoice:  though the demise of the vehicle was horrible and unfortunate (rear-ended and totaled by a beginner driver), I have a new replacement car at her expense, a 1996 Subaru Legacy L all-wheel drive.  I am now prepared for anything winter has to throw at me.
In comparison with the Neon, the Subaru Legacy has a much smooth ride.  This is due in part to the fact that my Neon's suspension was shot, but not entirely.  The wagon comes with P185/80 R14 tires, a few notches bigger than the Neon's.  Mine is an 4 cylinder automatic, and despite it's slower acceleration (a heavier car than the Neon), it still manages to climb any hill without chugging or groaning.  Wind noise is also less of a factor as is engine noise.  My only complaint is the wimpy sounding horn noise, typical of Japanese cars.

The all wheel drive feature kicks in when the suspension detects slippage (e.g. snow, ice, smeared road-kill) so fuel economy is a tad better than if it was engaged full time. As is it gets about 25-27 miles per gallon on the highway.

I found the car to take corners really well and it can turn on a dime, in comparison with cars such as a Honda Accord, which seems to me that it takes a football field to make a turn.

The seats and interior are nothing special, but I was comfortable after a 6 hour drive yesterday.  There is also plenty of head-room for those of us over 6 feet tall.  The same can be said for cargo space.  There is ample storage in the back for my mountain bike, which is a huge bonus for me.

After my vacation in Canada this winter, I'll update this review to let you know how it does in the snow.  My father has a similar model to this one, and he's very happy with it.  I would have to say it's a much better car than the Neon I owned for close to 6 years...although I do miss her.
