            When I first set out to look for a camera I was looking for high quality without spending thousands of dollars.  I did not think that was possible until I found this camera.  The pictures are true to life color and never need to be edited.  This is the first digital camera I have ever used that did not require some form of color correction.  The 2.3 megapixels allow beautiful prints even at 8X10.  I found the camera easy to use and enjoy the macro feature which allows you to take very close up shots, like the one of 6 keys on my keyboard.  The camera is very versatile and takes excellent pictures both indoor and outdoor, in bright and dark light.  I took a picture of a pitch black room and it looked like the lights were on after setting it to the longer exposure time.  I have also taken pictures of shadows, something I had never been able to do before with other digital cameras.  This camera is definitely a great start for any camera enthusiast that is wanting to replace or suppliment the standard SLR.  <br><br>
