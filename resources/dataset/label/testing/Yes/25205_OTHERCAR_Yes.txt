                 My 1992 Legacy Wagon was my third Subaru in a row.  First I bought a worn-out used wagon that I quickly traded in on a brand new '92 Loyale wagon--I put over 100K miles on that then retired it when the transmission went out.  

     I liked the Loyale and it convinced me to stay with Subaru (I hadn't had a minute's problem with it before the transmission); but it was my Legacy wagon that I &quot;fell in love&quot; with.  This car had everything I wanted:  AWD (I had a lot of snow to drive through when I bought it), AM/FM casette, automatic door locks and windows, AC, lumbar support, roof rack for the kids' skis, etc.  I bought it used in 1996 for $12K.  It had 40K miles on it.  
 
     The Legacy wagon moved me across country and served me well for another 3 years.  I no longer had snow to worry about, but the AWD was very reassuring on those rain-soaked freeways northern CA has in the winter.  Again I didn't have a moments problem with it.  

     I put 103K miles on it and had my first worries then...I've heard rumors that Subarus are great until the 100K point, then things start going wrong.  &quot;So far so good&quot;, but I couldn't forget the transmission I had to replace on the Loyale and the fact that I then sold it at a $3K loss.

     Before anything went wrong, last month I traded my beloved Legacy in on another brand wagon.  There's no comparison.  The Legacy was &quot;perfect&quot;.  It had plenty of room--I had a baby's car seat in the back seat and still room for an adult on each side of it.  Comfort was insurpassable in this price range.  It was totally reliable from Day 1 through 103K miles.  I never made a single repair to it in 4 years (and neither had the 0-40K owner).  

     I was totally insulted with the trade-in value the new-car dealer gave me for the Legacy.  I had checked the blue book value repeatedly over the last year and it had held its value up until 100K then dropped dramatically, so if you're a Subaru owner and don't plan on eventually spending money on repairs be sure to sell before that crucial point.

    I would HIGHLY recommend Subarus to others.  The cost of a new one was prohibitive for me right now, but in retrospect I realize that I would rather have had another used Subaru than a new anything else.
