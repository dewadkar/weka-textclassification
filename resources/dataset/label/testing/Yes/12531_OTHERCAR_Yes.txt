            My first digital was a Sony, with a floppy disk for storage.  I loved this feature as I did not want a camera that required software to special cables to get the images from the camera to the computer.  Floppies were easy to get, they just didn't store much.  

I know have the HP735 and have been somewhat impressed with it.  It is easy to use, compact, and takes pretty good images for printing.  I did get the HP Photosmart 245 printer when I got the camera, a nice addition.

There are a few down sides to the camera that potential users should be aware of.  First, battery life.  The camera uses normal double A batteries that don't last long at all.  On a good day shooting, you can expect to use 2 or 3 sets of batteries, minimum.

The camera comes with 64mb smart card and I purchased a 128MB to compliment.  This gives enough space for most outings.

Printing on the HP Photosmart is a snap and with the few extras on the printer, you can get nice images for your photo album.  I have found that before printing there is a need to always lighten the images.

Getting the images off the camera to my computer is a snap.  It's slow, but very easy.  There is software you can install to work with your images, but as a user of PhotoShop, I only needed the images and as stated in the beginning, did not want to install additional software.  The camera comes with USB cable the once plugged in to my WIndows XP system, the computer automatically sees the camera as a drive.  You simply find the images on the camera using "My Computer" and move the files from the camera to the computer.  Again, very easy, just don't be a hurry.  It is a little slow moving the images from the camera to the computer.  But at least, no software is required.

The 3.5 megapixels allows for printing up to 8X10.  I have only printed out 5X7 size photos and they look as good as ones developed at the store, which I have done to look for differences.  

A good camera for anyone looking for an easy to use digital.
