            The 1996 Chevrolet Corsica is my fourth car in six years. I purchased this car used. Having gone through so many cars in a short time gave me a good starting point for evaluating my car.

The car is dependable! I have had the vehicle for almost 3 months now and it shows no sign of being any less friendly than the day I purchased it. I have yet to travel long distances in the car, but I would not hesitate to should the occassion rise. The car handles great and the buttons and controls are right there where I need them

Minor problems are the only drawback to this car. The driver side door on my car is kind of hard to unlock and the lock on the ignition sometimes sticks, making it difficult to start the car. Other than that, this car runs great. My car comes with a basic stereo with cassette player. I must say that to me, my stereo has unusually small buttons. This is irritating when switching pre-programmed stations as much as I do.
