            PC Magazine recently rated Kodak DC-280 the best digital camera.  With so many on the market today, I took their advice.  Color me impressed!!  The photographic quality is amazing.  

I stayed away from digital cameras for quite awhile.  I just didn't want to sacrifice the quality of good 35mm photography for the convenience and speed of digital, but the quality pictures of this camera rival anything that I've taken with my Minolta SLR. There are several custom settings to take control of your photography: black and white, color, sepia, exposure, sharpness, metering, ISO, resolution, quality, etc.  Or you can use the defaults and let the camera take of the decision making. 

My husband and I take pictures nearly everyday now without the worry and expense of wasting precious film.  At the end of our photography session, we download our pictures and dump any rejects.

Adobe Photo Deluxe Business Edition software and Easy Photo software are included with the camera which allow you to view, edit, enhance, sort, copy to CD or floppy, and create a slide show.  The slide show feature is a favorite of mine.  The photos selected for the show are flashed in sequence on your computer screen - much easier than dragging out the old projector and screen.  A cable is included to hook up the camera to your TV for big group viewing.

This model may cost a little bit more than others, but you get a lot more in quality and control.    <br><br>
