            Not much to add to other reviewers. The car is a dream - it handles like a dream, it feels like an extension of your body, it accelerates like a jet fighter and it hauls grocery, your dog and a girlfriend. What else can you ask for?
A spare wheel would be nice. I know, the M Mobility sealant canister is included, but it would not help you in a case of major tire failure, like a blow out. 
I think that BMW, by not including at least a collapsible (as in Porsche) spare tire in this big sedan reduced the practicality of this car. To me, this omission is just plain stupid. As a remedy, I am actually thinking about adapting a Porsche collapsible wheel for my car for those long trips - just will keep in a trunk, occupying valuable cargo space. Reliability of this car is also a concern to me, although everything is fixed under warranty.

Nevertheless, this car is a gem and I will keep it for 10, 15 or 20 years - it will always be a classic expression of sport sedan excellence.
