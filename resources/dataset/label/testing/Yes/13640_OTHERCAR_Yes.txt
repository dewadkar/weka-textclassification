            The Kia Sportage offers those of us with SUV's on the brain an affordable, entry level option.  Before purchasing my Kia I test-drove several of the higher priced competitors in the enter level SUV market. I was impressed with them all but the price point of the Kia won me over. I purchased a new 1998 Kia Sportage with standard transmission in June of 1998. 
In the beginning, I was extremely impressed with Kia's follow-up care.  I received numerous customer service surveys, a touch up paint kit and various other gadgets and gismo's. It was not until my first true service needs that my opinion of Kia changed.
I will spare you the horrid details and list the basic issues with my Kia Sportage - 

*Under Carriage Rattles
*Knobs Fall Off 
*Air Conditioner Makes Humming Noiseï¿½s (HUGE ISSUE IN ARIZONA)
*Door Locks Often Malfunction 
*Door Handles Feel As Though They Will Break when You Open The Doors
*At High Speeds (60-75mph), The Motor Makes A Loud Wheezing Sound 
*Theft Protection Device Often Malfunctions 
*Poor Mileage In The City
*Poor Handling - The Sportage Is All Over The Road

The Kia Sportage is definitely filling a niche in the market place.  Unfortunately, it is not a well-made product.  I only wish that I had read Consumer Reports article on the Kia Sportage before my purchase.
