<TEXT>
            I lease a 1999 S-10 extended cab and am generally satisfied with my vehicle but to those who are considering a purchase I have two negatives to share. First the pickup upon acceleration is very poor and the gas mileage is at best terrible considering the lack of gutsyness with the engine. If you are considering purchasing one and it may be the right car for you, first take a test drive and see if you are ok with the acceleration performance. If you are not overly concerned about it after your test drive or if you do not have to pinch pennies for gas it may be the right truck for you. <br><br>
