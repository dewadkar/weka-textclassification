              Considering the large number of digital cameras available,my decision to purchase a Nikon 950 was an easy one. The 950 was the only camera that has an assortment of optional lenses, mainly a 8mm fisheye lens. The only other camera I would have considered would have been a Nikon D1 which was not available at the time, which is still not available,to me at least for lack of capital.
  
  The 950 has produced some exceptionally sharp clear images... however I would suggest installing the largest capacity CF card you can afford...
the memory card fills up quickly depending of resolution selected... on an 8M card expect about 4 images uncompressed... however for most web images a vga resolution would be acceptable...
The camera is well built, has a quality feel to it but...
the downside is a difficult to use interface, mainly selecting resolutions, exposure lock..etc.. the manual is on a CD rom , not very handy if you need to look something up...

The main problem with the 950 is the slow serial interface... it's useless. it's much faster to slide out the memory card and place it into a PCM adapter and download into a laptop computer... which brings us to the other problem... the CF card slot is dead bang on the bottom of the camera... which means if you have it mounted on a tripod... you'd have to remove the camera and unscrew the mount... a real headache if you needed to align your shots for a panorama...  another problem is with the accessory lenses... the optical viewfinder is blocked you have to rely on the LCD screen... which eats up battery power... which brings us to that other problem... if you use the wide angle lenses... the builtin flash is blocked hence... your pictures will come out dark...

despite all these problems, I will continue to use my camera... I attach an external flash unit... I use an SB-28 which works fine...
I carry lots of extra batteries (NIMH) a power inverter, to charge the batteries, and an ac adapter for the camera...

My bottom line is get the 990.. the CF card been moved to the side so you don't have to undo the tripod. Megapixels are now up to 3, The interface is faster.. I don't know how much faster. And get a external flash preferably a Nikon unit,
the images this camera produces are incredible... it's the best reason to buy one. <br><br>
