            Rented for a 1600 mile drive, mostly interstates, but some curving roads, and urban driving.  Car had 18K on the odometer, which translates to 36K for a non-rental (rental cars see much harder use).

Exterior Design:
The styling is about as bland and generic as a four-door can be.  Nothing ugly about it, but nothing memorable.  

Interior Design:
Very clean overall.  This car was equipped with a gray leather interior and CD sound system.  The workmanship was very good, with tight tolerances and no squeaks or rattles. Dash layout is good, with legible instrumentation.  Steering wheel mounted cruise controls were excellent and the car held its speed very well.  Center flip out console is very useful, with solid cupholders and lots of storage.  Can be flipped down to hide valuables and to convert the front seat to bench seating for three.  Ventilation controls were good, though a bit confusing (settings not marked "ac" seemed to provide ac).  Rear seat room is generous and comfortable, as is luggage space.  Overall, the interior layout is a highpoint for this car.


Performance:
Car handles firmly, but not crisply.  It doesn't feel like a German car.  Still, it's perfectly acceptable. The ride is firm and controlled, but comfortable.  Automatic transmission shifts smoothly.  This car feels reassuringly heavy, but the engine has a bit more weight to deal with than ideal, so initial acceleration is modest.  Still, there's enough power to easily hold high speed.  The car was stable up to 90mph (but seemed to have reserve for more).
