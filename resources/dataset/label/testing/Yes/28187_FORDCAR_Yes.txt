            We have a '95 Ford Taurus GL Wagon, and we love it. The key to this car's success is maintenance! If you think oil changes are all you have to do to keep the car in good shape, think again! You MUST change the transmission (transaxle according to Ford) fluid every 30,000 miles or so, to keep the fluid clean (it should be red!) and the car running smoothly. Some model years have had more transmission problems than others (we have heard of Taurus transmissions dying at around 90K miles) but I feel that if you take good care of your car, it will take good care of you.

Our particular model has power windows (one rear window is currently malfunctioning...it might go up, it might not!) power seat, A/C, third-seat (we don't let our kids sit in it- - seems safer to have them in regular back seat), and extra stereo buttons next to steering wheel for convenience. And this is key...drink holders!! 

We are very happy with our Taurus and we suggest following your maintenance schedule closely and getting undercarriage washes if you live in the North where they get nasty winters and salt the roads. If you check your transmission fluid and it looks brown, have it changed soon!! You can have this done either at a dealership or at a place like K-Mart for around eighty bucks. 

The car handles extremely well, the A/C blows ice cubes still, and the seats give excellent back support.
