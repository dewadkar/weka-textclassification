            In the fall of 1997 my folks bought me a 1993 Saturn SL2 in had about 63,000 miles on it at the time. I have loved it ever since. First of all, I have had a total of 1 problem with it the whole time I've owned it. The alternator needed to be replaced, other than that it has been perfect. I have always thought that the Saturns have looked really sharp. It's no muscle car (ohhh I wish!) but it does look sporty. I does have a pretty decent amount of power for a Inline 4. I can merge on the freeway with the best of them. The steering is very responsive, it handles ten times better than my friends Mustang GT and my mothers Accord. The gas mileage can't be beat. The back seat is kinda cramped but I usually don't have to worry about that. Another minor gripe is the factory radio but I quickly took care of that an added a Kenwood system. I have been really happy with this car and unless I become a great deal richer I will probably buy another Saturn. I recommend it to anyone looking for a compact car, something safe or a budget used car that will last.  <br><br>
