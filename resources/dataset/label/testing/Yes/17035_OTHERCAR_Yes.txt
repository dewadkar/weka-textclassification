            We bought our Durango when we found out I was pregnant with our second child. We had a Dodge Dakota club cab at the time. Our first son had to sit in front because the car seat wouldn't fit. So we decided to get a 1998 Durango so I didn't always have to climb in back. We thought we would miss our dakota but one ride in the durango and we know we were hooked. Plenty of room for family trips as we enjoy camping. The handling is excellent we think it is better than some cars we have driven. If you get the second seat in back the fold and tumble seat is excellent so you can get in the back easily. We have the 5.9L v8 with a 3.92 gear to make it better for towing. This vehicle tows very well. It has plenty of get up and go to merge with traffic. We have the option of full time 4wd which is excellent in rain and snow. So if you are looking for a SUV the D is excellent. Even for moms.
