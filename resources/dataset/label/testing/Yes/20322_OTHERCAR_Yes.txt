            I just graduated from college and got my first real job.  I needed a car that was inexpensive, but reliable.  I found a used 1995 Toyota Corolla and it has been the perfect car for me for the past year!

I have a long commute and drive my car over 60 miles a day - so I am putting a lot of miles on it.  It already has 110,000 miles on it and I haven't had one problem with it.  Of course I change the oil every three thousand miles, rotate the tires every other oil change, and take it in for the recommended mileage services.  But I haven't had one problem!  

The Corolla is a nice size car for a single person.  I can fit a lot of things in the trunk and it's comfortable to fit three people in the back seat.  It is probably too small for a family, but it's the perfect size for me.  

The gas mileage is wonderful.  It costs me approximately 13 dollars to fill up my tank and I usually get about 32 miles a gallon.  You can't beat that.

I highly recommend this car.  The next car I buy will probably be a new car and I will definitely be purchasing a Toyota and it will most probably be a Corolla.  The live up to their reputation for being very reliable!

Also note - I live in Wisconsin and have found this car to be wonderful in the snow.  <br><br>
