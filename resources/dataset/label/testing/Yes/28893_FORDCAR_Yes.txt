            I'm considering starting an on-line ford explorer club, do you think there is interest? I see many such clubs on the web for Mustangs, Camaros, Eclipses etc. There seems to be as many Explorers out there as anything so I think there could be a need for this. I will be contacting Ford to get their support and approval. My idea is to have a free membership where people can enroll and submit the latest news, information and developments regarding their vehicle, e-mail me if your interested at kevincwgordon@yahoo.com . If I get a good response I will start work on the site over the holidays. <br><br>
