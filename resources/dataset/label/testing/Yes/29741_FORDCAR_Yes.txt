            I have had my Explorer XLT for 1-1/2 years. I had never owned a Ford product before, but I love this one.

What sold me on it? With it's 8 way power seats, adjustable lumbar support and tilt steering it is very comfortable. I am 5' tall while my husband is 6'4&quot;. We are both equally comfortable in this car.

Of course I always sit in the front. The back seat, while as comfortable as most cars, is somewhat &quot;stiff&quot; compared to the front. Then again, maybe I'm just spoiled.

The XLT comes with an electronic, external temperature gauge and compass. While it seemed like extra fluff at first, they actually have come in handy several times. When you are in a strange city or perhaps in a country setting, it is very easy to get turned around. Look up, you have a compass on hand.

Gas mileage? Compared to our car, it does not get quite as good gas mileage. The Explorer averages between 20-25 mpg. It depends on which of us has been doing the main portion of driving and how many of the miles were in town or over the road. The gas mileage does compare equally with our pickup truck. It is actually a little better.

The one real down side to our Explorer? While you can haul a small load in it, it will not carry as much as we expected. The back seats lay flat and there are 2 anchors inset in the back to tie large items down.

While you can load several boxes in the back, it is not easy to haul items as big as a washer or dryer like Ford would have us believe.<br><br>
