            Talk about an impulsive purchase! I needed a third car to drive back and forth from my home on Long Island, NY to my retreat up in Northeast PA.  I currently have a Mercedes C320 Sport (2001) and was putting on too many miles (it's a lease). At first I considered a Honda Civic but my first trip was to a Subaru dealer in Scranton. I first drove the NON=TURBO Impreza and immediately realized that for an economy car it invoked a feeling of a much more substantial car.  Even with a wheelbase of only 99" it feels a little bigger. I then drove the 5sp WRX wagon they had and unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to explore the upper ranges of the tach. I ended up buying the WRX wagon and here is my review:

Most people who have written reviews here have purchased their WRX with a manual transmission. Unfortunately, since I live in a large metropolitan area did NOT want to deal with a manual.  Try driving two hours in bumper to bumper traffic with a clutch and you'll know what I mean. The automatic that Subaru provides is excellent.  It's SMOOTHER shifting than my Mercedes and it has a learning mode so once it LEARNS your driving habits it will shift even better. If you tend to have a heavy foot, it will hold each gear longer so that you maximize engine power. I usually keep the car in third gear around town and this makes the car MUCH more enjoyable since your moments away from boost.  The car is UNBELIEVABLE once you are a tad over 3000 RPMs.  Yes folks, a slushbox can be fun too if driven properly.  PLUS, with the auto on the WRX you get a much more advanced AWD system (Subaru's latest). You also get a limited slip rear differential which will really be a joy in the slippery stuff.

The car rides very well for what it is but be prepared for a stiff, but well controlled ride. The chassis is EXTREMELY stiff and it seems as if this car will hold up very well as the miles wear on.  The engine is extremely smooth for a 4 cylinder engine.  Even as the RPM's increase none of the vibrations are transmitted in the cabin or even through the steering wheel. I can say that this engine is much more refined than the Mercedes 230 Kompressor engine or the 1.8 liter engine found in Volkswagons and Audis. 

Handling is fantastic even with the mediocre rubber that Subaru provides (Bridgestone RE92). I hate throwing good tires away but I am tempted. 

Many people have commented that the interior is cheap and I have to disagree.  The interior is EXTREMELY functional and everything is where it should be.  The LESS electronics there are, the happier I am.  I enjoy driving this car more than my Mercedes. 

You owe it to yourself to take this car on a test drive.  I'm partial to the wagon since it has virtually the same performance as the Sedan but in a more user friendly package.  The seats fold flat and if you get it in silver, no one will know what lurks beneath that hood!
