            This is a great camrea for anybody that wants an easy to use point and shoot for sending pictures to family and friends over the internet. However, I feel that if you want to make prints bigger than 4x6, you may want to go to a top of the line model that takes standard lenses that would be used in a 35mm SLR camera. these cameras also have a better resolution, many up to 5 megapixels or higher.  However, you may end up paying a pretty penny for one, as much as 2-3000 dollars. If all you are interested in is a nice little fully auto point and shoot though then this is the camera for you. it has an "auto" mode where you can adjust some of the settings like exposure to some degree, white balance, and so on and so forth,as well as several preset modes liek sunny, backlit, party, etc. that will let you get your subject to look decent under almost any conditions without having to change a bunch of settings.  The one thing I don't like about this camera is that is has no manual mode, so you don't hava lot of control over aperature settings and the like. Also, it lacks the ability to take uncompressed .tiff pictures like the coolpix 800, my pervious digital camera.  I do like the rechargable battery though. it lasts much longer than regular AA or AAA batteries used in many digital cameras. I keep two on hand so when the one in the camera goes dead I can pop it on the charger and take the fully charged battery off the charger and keep on shooting. it is also much faster to replace than putting in 4 to 6 individual batteruies. not to mention cheaper. the conventional batteries can really add up!! ($$$)
overall, like I've said before, due to it's inablility to get a very high res picture and lack of manual features, I think this is a good little camera.
