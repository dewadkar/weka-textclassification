            When my husband and I decided to search for a new vehicle, we decided on a SUV.  We needed a &quot;Wagon&quot; type vehicle, and wanted to sporty look.  

After looking at other models of SUV's, we drove the Durango.  THAT WAS IT!  It was the vehicle we were looking for.  The ride was comfortable.  The vehicle handled beautifully!  The options were unlimited!  The best option was the 3rd seat.  

We have 3 children, 2 are twin toddlers, which means 2 car seats. With the Durango, we have room for all 3 children to sit comfortably because of the 3rd seat.  With the wider make of the Durango, we have room for friends to ride along because the car seats have room between them for a small person.  

If your looking for a SUV, consider the Durango.  You wont look any further!!
