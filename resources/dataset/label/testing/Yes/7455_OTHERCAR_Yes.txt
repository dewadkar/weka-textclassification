            When I took possession of my Silver-mist Metallic 4 door Grand Am GT, my smile was from ear to ear. It remained for 6 months. The car was delivered with 1 defect; the fog light on the passenger side was out, it was replaced by the dealer the following weekend. It came with every option, Sunroof, Alloys, EQ, Subwoofer {GM&#146s version}, except the following: Leather; Remote Keyless Entry; Chrome Wheels. I drove the car 500 miles in a few days, dumped the oil, changed to Mobil 1 {and used it exclusively, from then on}, and stepped on the throttle, hard, for 2 years, every chance I had; the entire time I owned the car.

My evaluation of the car follows:

(*) Strong Acceleration From 0 To 30 When The 3.4L Pushrod Was In Its Zone.
(*) Nearly Flawless Automatic Transmission.
(*) Good Highway Passing Power Until 80 MPH.
(*) Engine At 1,800-1,900 RPM At 60 MPH, Good Highway Mileage, About 30 MPG.
(*) Solid Body Structure {1st 25,000 Miles}.
(*) Excellent Handling.
(*) Excellent Sound System.
(*) Excellent Heating And Air Conditioning.
(*) Great Dashboard Layout {Most Professional Reviewers Would Disagree}.
(*) Excellent Traffic Prowess. Its Point & Shoot Ability was Outstanding.
(*) Pleasurable, If Unrefined Engine Sounds {1st 25,000 Miles, To 4,500 RPM}.
(*) Trunk Space / Split 60/40 Rear Seat.
(*) The Color, Although I&#146d See Myself Coming As I Was Going, Occasionally.

(-) Weak Acceleration Any Time The Tac Climbed Above 4,500 RPM.
(-) No Highway Passing Power Any Time The Tac Climbed Above 4,500 RPM.
(-) Low Ground Clearance. 
(-) Cladding Made Of Fragile Thin Gauge Plastic, Bonded (3-M Tape) And Screw Fit.
(-) Front Seats Not Comfortable For Long Trips (3  Hours).
(-) Rear Seats Not Kid Comfortable For Long Trips (3  Hours).
(-) Trunk Opening And Hinges Rob You Of Too Much Usable Space.
(-) Hard Ride On Rough Roads, Intolerable Ride On Cobblestones.
(-) Not Pothole Tolerant.
(-) Wind Noise Above 45 MPH.

After 25,000 Miles:

(*) Nearly Flawless Automatic Transmission.
(*) The Breaks Were Still Strong, As New! No Wheel Shudder, As Reported By Some.
(*) Engine Performance Was As New!; Although The Sound Was Not As Pleasurable.
(*) The Heating And Air Conditioning Were Still Top Notch.
(*) The Paint Finnish Was Still Top Notch, And Glossy.
(*) The Rims Wore Well, Very Little Damage From Rotation, And Rebalancing.

(-) The Front End Thudded, & The Sunroof Squeaked. No Leaks.
(-) Handling Was Slightly Softer; But Still Great!
(-) The 1 And Only Service Problem&#133 The Serpentine Belt Squeaked... Annoying!..
&#133 Even After Both Belt And Pretension Assembly Were Replaced. Very Annoying!!!
&#133 Everything Worked As It Should, But The Sound Was As If I Had A 20Year Old Car.
(-) Damage From Road Clutter, A Truck Tire, Broken Passenger Side Sill Cladding&#133
&#133 Too Expensive To Repair {1.2K}. Damage Only Visible On Underside Of Sill&#133
&#133 The Cladding For The Sill Extends Up To The Middle Of The Door, As 1 Piece&#133
&#133 And Runs The Entire Side Of The Car Between The Wheels, Repainting Is Required.
(-) The Interior Was Easily Soiled, Hard To Clean. The Flooring Did Not Wear Well.

After 45,000 Miles:

(*) Nearly Flawless Automatic Transmission.
(*) The Breaks Were Still Strong, As New! Still Not In Need Of Replacement.
(*) Engine Performance Was Almost As New; Knocking Occasionally. No Oil Burning.
(*) The Paint Finnish Was Still Top Notch, And Glossy.
(*) The Rims Wore Well, Very Little Damage From Rotation, And Rebalancing.

(-) Engine Sound Now Not Pleasurable. To Many Other Sounds, Valves, Belts, Clatter.
(-) Degraded 0 To 60 Performances; I Clocked 7.6/7.7 Seconds New; Now 7.8/8.0.
(-) The Front End Thudded, Only Worse, & More Often, & The Sunroof Was As Before.
(-) Handling Was Softer Still; But Great None The Less.
(-) The Serpentine Belt Still Squeaked, Less And Softer Than Before, Very Annoying!!!
(-) Now The Front Seats, Front Seat Backs, And Center Console Showed Wear.
(-) Turn Signal Relay Would Click Occasionally, On Its Own, And Then Stop&#133
&#133 Even If The Car Was Idling, With No One At The Wheel, Or Touching The Stalk...
&#133 The Turn Signal And Hazard Lights Always Worked When Engaged&#133 
&#133 And Never Flashed When The Relay Clicked&#133 Mystery!

Having Sold The Car I Miss The 0 To 30&#146s; The Handling; The Breaking. Would I Recommend The Car&#133 Yes! To The First Owner For 50K Miles; If Purchasing For 20K Or Less {More Than 20K, Look At Altima V6, More Than 25K, Accord V6}. 

Note; Depreciation Is Bad For This Model. Changes From 2000 Model Year; The SCT Appearance Package Is Not Worth The Money, Except For The Rear Spoiler; New Sound System Not As Good As Old; New Turbine Style Rims Harder To Clean, More Prone To Service Damage.
