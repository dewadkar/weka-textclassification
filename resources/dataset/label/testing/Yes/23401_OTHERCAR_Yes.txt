            This was my first truck and I love it.  I bought it used last June and it was exactly what I wanted.  Me and my wife travel a lot and our other car is a Geo Metro, so needless to say we needed a more comfortable vehicle that had lots of uses.  I can fit plenty in the extended cab and it runs great.  The only problem that I've had is if I run over 75 mph for an extended amount of time, the Service engine light will come on and stay on for about a week.  During this time, the gas mileage dips a little.  It goes away a suddenly as it starts.  I need to get that looked at.  Other than that, I can truly say: &quot;I love my truck!!!!&quot;<br><br>
