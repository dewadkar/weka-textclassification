                                   My 1998 Cutlass GL
   Let's go back to the year 1998. Oldsmobile had come out with a new style for their Cutlass, new options and a sleeker look. I had at the time a 1992 Olds Cutlass Sierra S and loved it. However, I needed an upgrade. I decided to stick with the Oldsmobile line. My wife and I , on our anniversary, went shopping for this new car. We chose a 1998 Cutlass GL. It was used with 8000 miles. The color was what got me, metallic opal blue, beautiful.
   The car now has 29000 miles on it and ive had no problems. I love the way it drives and handles. It is worth the $15000 i paid for it. I recently tinted the windows and put in a CD player. I also bought new aluminum rims to enhance its look. 
   OK, now that we have the skinny on the car, lets get to the reason for my opinion. Aftermarket parts, where are they? Ive searched far and wide for parts to enhance horsepower and havent found any yet. I looked at 25 different online parts dealers that specialize in these items and havent found any for my 98. Well, I guess its not a sports car and maybe even considered a family car but this is America and dang it I want parts for my car.
   In closing, I will say, I like the car very much, however, aftermarket parts are a mystery not to be solved by consumers but by the performance dealers.<br><br>
