            My last vehicle was a 1992 Ford Ranger Sport 2WD, with 3.0L V6, alloy wheels, a/c, and antilock brakes.  I bought it with 50k miles (when it was 5 years old), and sold it 3 years later with 120k.  It is an extremely reliable vehicle - the only 'non-routine' maintenance I had to do was replace a water pump.

It had a 5spd manual transmission which helped out the somewhat under-torqued engine, and at the time I sold it, its original clutch showed no signs of going out.

I took it on several cross-USA road trips, and it performed well on every one.  I got between 18-28MPG, but the usual was about 24.  It had some minor rusting when I first got it (in Wisconsin), but I kept it washed and it never spread any further.

It also had a camper shell on the bed, which I recommend highly if you do 'car camping'.  Never need to set up a tent - just crawl in the back of the truck.

Finally, for a 2WD, it still had great ground clearance and I was thus able to do some 4WD roads with it if I knew what I was doing.  It has a small size for a truck and I was even able to park in 'compact' parking spaces now and then.  Very light and nimble on its feet.

I recommend a Ranger (of any variety, really) for someone who wants a truck and the utility that goes with it, but doesn't want to spend a lot either on the purchase price or on gas/maintenance later.  Its not really good if you haul more than 1 passenger - even extended cabs are usually cramped.  But if you're a young single person who likes to drive, travel, and camp, this is a great truck.<br><br>
