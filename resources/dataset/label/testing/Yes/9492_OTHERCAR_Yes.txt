            i bought this truck when it was 6 mo. old and never had a problem with it since.  in the past Dodge has been a great brand for me i have had nothing but good luck with them.  

I have found that The dodge ram 1500 series has the better powertrain in the industry and has the largest engine in its class.  it has been a very reliable truck.

the truck has a very distinctive ride.  it is a smooth ride thst is unlike any other.  very quiet!!

i have also found that it has the best stereo in industry. it has teamed up with Infinity Sound systems and created a 3 Stereo effect
