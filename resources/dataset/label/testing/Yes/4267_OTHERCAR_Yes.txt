                 The BMW 318 Series has a nice front. I bought the car because the vehicle is quite sporty, yet with all of the glamour and strength the car has to offer to a driver, the price range is loyal too! The car runs swiftly and the rate of gas intake is dependable as well. The BMW 318 series is a demon on wheels with its slick tires and small though elegant body. I love the character of the car but the body has some aerodynamic errors. The car appears to be a sports car, though its aerodynamic qualities don't seem to help it in the long run. I believe in my opinion that this vehicle should be recommended to buyers ages twenty to thirty-five. <br><br>
