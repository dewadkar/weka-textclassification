            I am so glad I bought this truck. I am in sales, So I drive a lot.
How much? About 50,000 miles a year. If I drove something un-reliable, I would lose money. This was my first new vehicle purchase.
I drove this truck hard; Snow, Rain, Mud.
From the heat of Arizona to Skiing in Oregon.
180,000 miles later, 1 repair and minor!
This was the 4 cylinder model &amp; I have read that the 6 cylinder is even more reliable. 
I also found this rig fun to drive, For a truck.
In 5th gear at 80 m.p.h. The drive is just smooth and quite.
Also, unlike other trucks I have driven, This one goes around the corners very well &amp; very predictable. 
I bought this truck to give Nissan a chance at my business.
I know Toyota's are well built also, but the Nissan is a lot less money &amp; the extra-cab is bigger.
Please save yourself some money and test drive a Nissan.<br><br>
