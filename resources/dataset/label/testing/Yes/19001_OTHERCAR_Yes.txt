             I have had the Hyundai Tiburon for 4 months and have put 3000 miles on it since. I finally made the purchase after looking at ALL the usually suspects I won't name them, we all know who I am talking about anyway. 

This car was well optioned to start with. I bought the V6 model so there really wasn't any thing it lacks except the sun roof because of problems I have herd they have with leaking and getting stuck in the open position. 

The whole design of the car from sheet metal to the high quality interior has to be the best you can get for a car in this price range. Front seats are very supportive (good for long drives). As for the rear seats they could be a torture test for anyone bigger than a child. 

Now storage space in this car is better than I thought it would have been. I can't believe I am saying this but I am glad it is a hatch back, when seats are folded down you have a lot of room.

Stereo in this car is loud not loud ouch my ears hurt, but loud it feels like a massage in your seat courtesy of the six speaker and one subwoofer stereo system.

Performance for me is perfect well ok not perfect but I think any car could use more power. Engine is smooth and quiet, lots of power after about 35 mph. Fuel economy is sad for a car of this size I get only 22 to 27mpg. city/highway. Steering is great, responsive at high speeds easy to maneuver for parking.  

All in all this is an easy to live with sports car.
