            After my husband and I made a 15-hour car trip with a baby, I vowed that I wouldn't make another long trip until we had a much bigger vehicle! We had already had problems trying to lug some larger items home, like a computer and a lawnmower. 

After reading several reviews, I decided that either a Toyota Sienna or a Honda Odyssey was the way to go. This was when they were first coming out with these vans, and it was impossible (at least in my area) to just go buy one. They all had to be special ordered. When I couldn't get ahold of an Odyssey to test drive, that option was out. I wouldn't buy a car I couldn't at least test drive. Luckily, I was able to test drive the Sienna, and I found it so comfortable and surprisingly easy to drive. I was worried it would feel like a semi, but it was just like a car.

We're fairly simple folks, so we got the mid-range model (the LX). We liked this one better because it had the captain's chairs (easier to get to the back of the car, I think, and keeps the kids separated) and two sliding doors.

In the three years I've owned this van, I've been quite pleased with its reliability. It was one of the reasons I picked a Toyota, and it has lived up to its good name. I have had no problems at all with it except for a dash clock that works when it feels like it. This may be a simple problem to fix, but I haven't been bothered enough by it to change the fuse, let alone take it to the dealer.

I often have my kids (both in car seats) sit in the back row, and I have one of the captain's seats removed (in the middle row). This allows me to get them in quickly out of the elements or if we are someplace where I don't feel safe, and I can take my time buckling them in. I can easily walk up to the front seat when I've finished getting them settled. 

The drawback on this vehicle is the rather small (for a minivan) trunk area. Granted, a smaller trunk means a shorter car -- it fits in my garage easily, and I can even open the hatch whether the garage door is open or closed. And I DO always have a full-size stroller in the back, which limits my space even more. I'd love to have the seats that fold down into the floor. But it's rare that I really need a ton of room in the back. When I do, I either put my kids in the 2nd row and remove/fold the back seat, or I use a canvas cargo carrier on the rooftop luggage rack.

I've heard that other minivan seats are terribly heavy and cumbersome. The Toyota's seats aren't light, but I can remove and re-install them by myself pretty easily, and I'm not a weightlifter. The rear seat appears to be a bench, but is really two separate seats, so you can either remove one or both, or fold down one or both. It's very versatile in that respect.

I've been so pleased with my Sienna, and if I had to buy a new van tomorrow, I'd buy another Sienna. Only I'd get a gold/champagne color -- to hide the dirt! 

Finally, I was thrilled when the Sienna was rated one of the safest cars around. Just more proof that it's the best minivan out there!
