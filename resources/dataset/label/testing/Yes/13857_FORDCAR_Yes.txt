            I needed an auto to drive ~35 miles each to a new job and wanted something reliable, fuel efficient but big enough to carry four people if needed.  Having a good experience with my 1994 Ford Crown Victoria, I checked out the dealer and chose the Contour (I had rented and driven one in Denmark/Germany, marketed there under the name Mondeo).

The car is stylish enough for me, roomy enough to hold 4 people, reasonably good on gas mileage and has not caused me a single problem during the 21 months that I have owned (I have ~27,000 miles on it.)  It is relatively quiet, has enough &quot;pep&quot; to deal with the So. California freeway traffic conditions, and is easy to drive.  The rubber bumpers have held up reasonably well through the two times that other drivers have rear-ended me.  In one case, the other car had a caved in front and slightly buckled hood, and I had only a cosmetic blemish on the bumper.  The other fender bender caused a large scratch into the bumper, but since the color is uniform throughout the rubber, it is not noticeable enough to even worry about.  Finally, the various buttons and controls for the radio, window washer/wipers, heater, etc, and located in places very easy to reach (ergonomically designed) and well lit when the car is driven at night.

My only complaint about the Ford Contour are the &quot;Recall&quot; notices that continue to appear.  I have taken the car in to respond to at least five (%!) recall notices about minor items like switches for the lights, heater, air-bag sensor and the like.  The replacements have not cost me a penny, but it is annoying to have to make these appointments to get the work done.  I just received the latest in this series of recall notices, this one with a warning that repairs need to be done...We will see what that is all about.

All in all, I would recommend the car as reliable and worth the price (as much as anything is these days).<br><br>
