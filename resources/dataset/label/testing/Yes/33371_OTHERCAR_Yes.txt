            We purchased this car back in August of 1999 (its a 99 New Jetta).  It has all of the options that we would have wanted on the car.  In general, we love the car.  VERY nice car for the price.  Rides and drives like a much more expensive car in my opinion.  The ONLY thing that I dont like about the car is the small things that seem to break (although so far, we havent had to pay to have any of them repaired).  The front bumper broke off the car less than a day after we bought it - it was pulled off by a plant in a planter box.  The sunroof cover (the inside sun screen) broke just a couple of weeks ago - we couldnt slide it open or closed.  The rear cup holder has broken once - it wouldnt stay closed.  And, the snaps that hold the floor mats down have broken on two of the mats.  ALL of these items have been taken care of by the dealer - at no cost to us.  Just a pain to have to drive the car to the dealer to have them taken care of.

Other than those small issues noted, the car is a joy to drive.  We recently took the car on a short vacation, and enjoyed the drive completely.  

Anyone interested in a great value in a compact car that doesnt look or drive like a compact should consider this car - its well worth a test drive at least.  If you need seating for more than 5 - this isnt the car for you.<br><br>
