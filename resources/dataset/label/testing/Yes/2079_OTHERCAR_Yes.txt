            In truth I've always thought that a Cadillac was an &quot;old man's&quot; car.  The Saville has changed my mind.  
I'll be honest I'm not talking about a 2000 model year, I just bought a 1992 Saville.  
This car may be 8 years old, but it still runs like a champ.  It give you the feeling that you are wrapped in luxury.  The interior has soft curves that look very classy and refined.  
The body is a vision of pure class and top design.  
You feel as though you should be dressed up every time you're in this car.
The V8 engine offers enormous amounts of excelleration yet is whisper quite.  
The car that I just purchased is loaded with options.
I would highly recommend this car for the person who's looking for a vehicle with high class and high performance.<br><br>
