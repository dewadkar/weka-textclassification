            I bought my S-10 new in 1997.  After back surgery and ongoing back problems I still needed a pickup, but comfort was a major consideration.  In my job at the time I would often load up the back with tools and clothes, climb in, and drive for 700-800 miles in one day.  With the S-10 I could do that and at the end of the day climb out and still walk.  That is nice.
My S-10 is an extended cab.  The seats in back are not good for a long trip, but they do work well to take one or two of the grand kids up to the lake fishing.  Most often that rear space is used for storing stuff that you don't want outside though.
The V-6 engine provides more than enough power for this little truck, but is still economical to operate.  I usually get around 22mpg on the highway and 19mpg around town.  
Chevy made this truck in two basic driveline-suspension packages.  You could either have a unit rated to haul a lot, or one rated to tow a lot.  Mine is the towing package.  It will tow 5000 lbs with no problem, and very little loss in gas mileage (about 3mpg towing a 2000 lb travel trailer).  It won't haul much though.  Anything more that about 500 lb causes it to wallow pretty badly.
I've got 53,000 miles on the truck now, with nothing more than a new set of front tires at about 50,000, and regular oil changes. 
If you need a little pickup for light duty, I really don't think that dollar for dollar, you can do much better than the Chevy S-10.
