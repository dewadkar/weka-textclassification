            This camera fits my family. We are not photo-geeks just average people who want to chronicle our lives. It shoots great pictures in the auto modes up to 8X10 inches. You get to see your picture on the large LCD immediately before it is stored on the in-camera 158MB CD. No need to download to a computer unless you want to to modify your pics. Just easily plug the camera into your TV and view the pics! The Pixela software for the computer is easy to use if you want to enhance your photos like cropping, resizing or eliminating red-eye from my kids or green-eye from the cats and dog.
 
This camera is easy to use for the novice photographer but has all the flexibility in the on-camera menus to make the difficult shots a reality from macro at 3 inches of my wife's flowers to the 6X zoom for the football game.. BTW you can store from 235 (1600x1200) shots to 1291 (640X480) shots on one 158MB mini-CD and they cost about a $1 each. Thats like getting 1200 4x6 inch photos for a buck to buy the film and develop. (How many 6cm CDs can you carry in your shirt pocket on vacation?) I will never buy film again! Just price one 128mb memory chip for other cameras and that should convince-ya that you should see this camera!  AND you can shoot a 23 min. MPEG movie on one CD!! This is a real movie, not a slide show! FROM A STILL-SHOT CAMERA!!!..you've got to be kidding....NOPE..it will do it.

PS. I knocked the lack of viewfinder and the battery above. Let me add, the large 2.5 inch wide viewfinder is bright enuff to use in full sun so you don't really need a viewfinder but if you do, you can get an add-on viewfinder from SONY. And the Battery will last for over 2 1/2 hours and gives you a minutes remaining calculation (not a countdown clock) in the display. The battery recharges (2 hours) in the camera from provided AC cord. If you are the average person/family, and you don't need to take pictures bigger than  8x10 inches, and you don't want to dedicate yourself to learning how to be a photo-geek, but you do want to take great pics of your life/vacation/family...I highly recommend this camera. 

If you buy it now (Dec 02) you will get a $50 rebate and a $20 SONY Store coupon. I used mine to buy two add-on lenses and the shipping was free.
