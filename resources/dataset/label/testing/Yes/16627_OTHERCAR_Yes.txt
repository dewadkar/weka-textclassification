            On May 8, 2001, I bought my first Hyundai Accent.  I based my purchase on the only criterion I've known to be useful.  I couldn't find one for sale in the used car ads.  That's usually a good sign.  It was a GS model, tricked out with A/C, CD player, and security system.  It was still very affordable.  What struck me most about it was that it was surprisingly roomy for a small car, and it handled very nicely.  In a period of very high gas prices, it was gratifyingly easy on the fuel.  The control system was fairly nice, although I noticed that it was fairly easy to turn the headlights on while signalling, and fairly easy to turn on the windshield wipers while going for the gear shift.  These were minor inaugural difficulties that I never had the chance to sort out.  It came with a built in Turbo feature. Being a very small engine equipped with an Air Conditioner, it was easy to get a noticeable power boost by simply turning the A/C off.

You will notice that I've been talking in the past tense.  I bought my second Accent on August 11, 2001.

My first car was T-Boned at an intersection by an SUV.  Initial contact was on the driver's side rear, just aft of the driver's door.  The car was spun around 180 degrees, bounced sideways over two medians, and across two lanes of traffic before coming to rest.  I emerged from the accident with a bruised shin, a slightly sprained thumb, and a bent fingernail.  After a day off work to settle down, I was back in the saddle again.

That is what I'd like to stress.  The first car was totalled off.  The estimator guaged CDN $15000 damage on a car that cost CDN $14400.  The tow-truck driver had to remove it with a dolly, because three of its four tires were destroyed utterly.  I emerged from the accident unscathed, and literally laughing my head off.  I was thrilled to be alive.  After a month to settle the insurance stuff, I went straight back to the same dealer and bought another Accent.  This one is a GSi model.  It has a few spare horsepower and a few more amenities.

I can't offer any information about its gas mileage, since I just put the first post-purchase tank of gas in it yesterday.  This one has power steering, so it handles much nicer than the first (which had manual steering).  In most other respects, it's the same vehicle.  More horsepower, sun-roof, leather steering-wheel and gear-shift, larger tires, etc.  After I've driven this car for a few months, I'll put in another review.

From my brief exposure to this vehicle, I can tell you this.  If you plant to put A/C on it, get the GSi.  It doesn't notice the power drain nearly as much as the GS does, and its not that much more expensive.

I went back to Hyundai for one reason and one reason only.  I believe I owe my life to the first one.  Where I come from, the hardware is disposable.  A $15000 write-off is worthwhile if it means that I can walk away from it.  In the instant before the collision, I was busy doing my Hail Marys.  The most surprising thing about the accident was that when it was over, I was still able to turn off the ignition key and exit the vehicle under my own power.

Lest readers think that I get in an accident regularly, I've been driving for 26 years, and this was my first collision.  It wasn't the fault of the car, or me.  Sometimes accidents are simply unavoidable.  The important part is that I'm here to tell you about it, and my most serious injury was the bent fingernail.  That actually bled for about three minutes.  That's worth a car.
