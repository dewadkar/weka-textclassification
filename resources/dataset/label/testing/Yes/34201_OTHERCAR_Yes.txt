            I bought the SOny DSC-p9 while staying in Korea during the World Cup, and I must admit its really fancy. After the initial charging of the included battery, I had tons of fun trying out the P9's many features. Especially the movie aspect.

Let me start off by telling you the picture quality. you have many to choose from, but because the included 16MB memory stick was small, I didnt use the maximum setting because when I did, I was only able to fit in about 12 pics. But setting the camera 1280x960 I was able to fit in 33 pictures, which is ok. And the quality is very decent as well. The menu settings allow you to have a lot of control over what you want, although you can't manually set the aperture setting, but that's ok, because this camera was meant for people like me, who don't know or even want to know how to manually set these things.

The night shot works ok, I did have some trouble at first, but overall, the camera did work well in very dark situations, you just have to remember to hold the camera very still, since the lens is open for a longer period of time, which means that any type of movement will distort the image.

The flash is very bright, but it does take the camera a bit longer than I would like for it to recharge inbetween taking pictures. Roughly 4-6 seconds. Sometimes up to 10, depending on how much battery power you have left. Also, the flash eats the battery power very quickly. 

The zoom on the camera which is digital 6x, works very well, better than i have seen on most digital cameras within this range. 

Now onto the fun stuff. The moving pictures portion for the camera is really good. you can take full motion movies at 320x240. And unlike many other cameras, you can make as long as the movie you want with sound up to the storage space on the memory stick. With the included memory stick, you can get 11 minutes worth. although the quality isn't that great but it is fun to use at times. Another nice feature is the multishot in lieu of the movie. this is where the camera will take a series of pictures with one click. It's really fun to play with.

Now the casing of the camera is really great. It feels solid in my hand and unlike other cameras that have the plasticy feel, this one is more rugged because of its aluminum alloy body. It's light yet sturdy, and it can take a beating. I dropped my camera a few times during some heated moments at the World Cup, but it kept on going. ALthough I don't suggest you do this. 

Of course a great feature of all digital cameras is the LCD display. The p-9 sports a great 1.5" lcd that is bright and crisp even in the outdoors where most other cameras seem to washout. The navigation is done by a rocker button, which can be a hassle for anyone with big fingers, but it ultimately is a great piece of design. The only down fall I have with the lcd is that it isn't a touchscreen. When reviewing pictures, you are able to zoom into the picture and edit on board such as cropping, rotating and zooming in and out of the picture all within the camera. The clarity even at 1280x960 is unbeleivable. I took a picture of some history tablets while visiting the museums, and using the zoom i was able to read every single word in the picture, without having to take pictures of each section. that was really great!

The camera is unbeleivable especially when using a 128MB memory stick. I am able to fit over 300 pictures at the 1280x960 mode, and 112 at the highest setting which is 2392x1400. I generally use the landscape mode

This is one great camera! I've taken a look at other 4 megapixel cameras and but this was the only one that had a great design, and sturdy feel. I tried the minolta which looks similar to the p-9, but it felt weak, and it felt as if I would have to be very careful when taking pictures, which isn't always the case.

Sony has done great things with the DSC-P series of camera's and they know when they have a killer design along with fantastic features. And this one is no different. The 4 megapixel quality should last for a few years, and I know it will last, since I put it through the battles of the World Cup.
