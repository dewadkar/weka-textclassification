            The engineers who designed this car must have made some very important tradeoffs.  First: they agreed that they were going to make a car for a relatively specific market - educated, upwardly mobile professional, less than 6' but taller than 5', 150-225 lbs, kids likely, but somewhat active, comparison shopper who looks for details rather than image, and a value shopper. It is Acura's car for the "near-luxury" market - one of the toughest car markets there is, because most buyers in this space ARE value shoppers, so stats do count, but so does price.  You will know this by inspecting those little details of the car - it really does talk to a specific buyer.  I will try to list the details below - this might prove my point.

Overall features:
Just about everything you would ever want - there's no point in listing, because you can get them all from the website.  The only features missing are minor ones like seat position memory, automatic headlight activation at dusk, night-vision windshield :), etc.

Interior Dimensions:
The car has a very narrow tolerance for your height and weight category. If your over 6', you will not be comfortable - your head will hit the part where the roof dips down to make room for the sunroof, or the back edge of the visor.  Also, the steering wheel will not adjust to you properly and might block your view of the instruments. If you are too short, you'll also have problems because the steering/seat adjustments don't do much for you.  If you are in the sweetspot, it is PERFECT!  Steering allows for fine-tuning adjustment so you can see the instruments, but you have some range to go low (sport style) or high (soccer moms who frequently get in and out of the car).  The back is equally unforgiving on height, even though there is great legroom.  Of note: the front seats are cleverly designed to curve OUTWARD on the top.  This gives the front passenger seats some visual stability without sacrificing the rear passenger's legroom.  It's a clever and stylish, yet functional design.

Performance details:
I loved Acura's variable assist. If you're fast on the road, you know what I mean - give me a stiff, ultra sensitive steering with a tight ratio and I feel young again.  The TL has it tuned perfectly.  At the right speed, you can tell what kind of road surface your on in the corners.  In the snow, you feel whatever is beneath you.  Parking, however, is easy.  The sacrifice, of course, is that if you're used to two-finger steering, this isn't the car for you.  If plush and sporty are opposites on a scale, the TL's steering is on the sporty side.

Transmission:
Very smooth shifting through every gear in every situation.  Power transmission is even throughout acceleration.

Acura learns from racing:
You can see this by looking at little details in the engine room, such as an upper front strut tie-bar.  What does this do, you ask? Here's my explanation: Cars have sheet-metal frames - it's a fact of economic design.  Today's unibody car frames are light and durable, but they flex a little.  This flexing causes what is known as a slight "roll" and twist in the frame; to the driver, it reduces steering sensitivity and can increase cabin noise during cornering.  Auto aficionados have been buying aftermarket tie-bars to stiffen this area when they beef up a stock car, yet this comes standard on the Acura.  It may seem minor, but the company is completely consistent in thinking about these "little" details, and the result is in the statistics of the car: great cornering and a wonderful feel when you bring it to the edge of a controlled skid.  To an Engineer, this is important!

Interior:
Acura gives few options.  Again, they're after a particular market.  If you want image, euro-styling, "real" leather seats, or need things just your way, this probably isn't your car.  The few styling choices and options, however, give way to excellent precision and quality.  The design is harmonious; seams are tight; squeaks are non-existent, even over rough terrain; access for all controls is easy; all buttons are visible; lighting on panels at night is uniform; the action of all buttons is smooth and linear.. In general, it exudes precision and durability.  Not only are the parts well put together, but they're done so permanently - you'll find little flexing and movement over time.  The precision of assembly is not a "superficial" job, indicating that the precision and tight tolerances extend all the way down to the sheet metal that the panels are bound to.

I must say: Acura also knows something about the "new-car smell".  This is a great smell that stays in the Acura for years.  I am almost positive that it is by design.  Did you know the seats are not real leather? Who cares!!  To me, leather is only valuable because it has a feel and "smell" to it that keeps.  The seats on the TL feel AND smell just like leather, but as a synthetic, they will be more durable.  That is a tradeoff that the value shopper will make.

The cockpit:
Driver has power seat adjust with height, front to back, seat tilt, rear tilt, lumbar lever (only in/out, and not height), adjustable right armrest, heated seats (low/high), heated mirrors, and steering tilt. Missing is: power-lumbar adjust, complete seat/backrest independence, telescope on steering, adjustable seat temperature (more than just low/high) and right armrest HEIGHT adjustment (available on the RL).  The last one is important to me because the feature that adds height adjustment is a simple, inexpensive mechanism - there's no reason to leave this out of the TL.

Exterior:
The styling of the TL is average - not too flashy, but not too plain.  Again, few options are available, but I do recommend the wheel splashguards as the only really useful option - they keep the sides of the car from getting too much road splash from the wheels.  The rest of the options are mostly cosmetic.
All seams are uniform and tight - smooth contours, and side viewing shows how nice the tolerances are.  I like to listen to a door when I open and close it - this tells you how much attention is paid to technical details: sound, cabin air pressure, tolerances, smoothness of the door mechanisms, etc.  The TL has a great sounding door, even if you slam it shut.  It doesn't "overshoot" its locking mechanism or sound harsh no matter how you shut it, and it can close with very little pressure.  As you open the door, the handles don't flex too much in any direction but what was intended, and the action is very smooth.

Handling:
The TL is luxurious yet sporty - comfortable inside, but not overly spacious.  It is heavier than an Accord, but lighter than most luxury cars.  The trade-offs make an ideal handling vehicle - much more agile than most luxury cars, but not as agile as lighter, sportier cars.  Any lighter, however, would mean a sacrifice in comfort.  If comfort and sportiness were at opposite ends of a scale, I would put the TL as a more sporty handling vehicle.

The skid test:
Hard to do with ABS breaks!  As expected, hard breaking to skid initiates the ABS modulation of the breaks.  In a cornering skid, however, handling is very predictable.  This must be another Honda/Acura hallmark, because I've tested many cars in hard corning/skids, and very few offer a nice, predictable skid.

Working under the hood:
Many, many cars deserve the palm to the forehead gesture when you open the hood (as in: "what were they thinking?!") - not the Acura.  If you want real proof, bring it for an oil change and ask the guy underneath if he likes what he sees. The answer is "YES". Now this may seem trivial, but look at it this way - the person that has to work under there does a better job if they know an engineer gave some consideration about their work space.  Acura does care, and it shows in the smallest details under the hood.

Documentation:
The manual is complete, right down to telling you how to reset the oil-change light (normally done by the dealer).  I have found everything I would expect in an owner's manual, including a few tips you would normally find in aftermarket service manuals.

A note about sport shift:
Not much is written about this, so I will tell you what it is - you can put the car in semi-manual shifting mode by pulling the shifter towards your leg. This puts the shifter in a separate slot with + and - indicators rather than the usual R D N 3 2 1.  If you push up towards the '+', you shift up.  Pull down towards the '-' and you shift down.  No clutch necessary.  This is one fun feature! Imagine you're on a single lane road, waiting to pass a truck and you have few opportunities to do so.  With a standard, you would normally downshift to a higher RPM for the acceleration and ride like that until you see your opportunity for a quick burst in speed.  With sport shift, you can hold the car at whatever gear you want, eliminating any delay that automatic transmissions have in hunting gears.

This is a smart shifter - if you forget to shift down when coming to a stop, the car downshifts for you.  It will not shift up for you, however, but that's not as important.  

Biggest gripe:
The switch for the moonroof is on the left side of the steering column on the dash.  This means only you can control it.  The moon roof is the fifth window - the front passenger should have access to adjust it.  A minor gripe, which should tell you something about the car.
