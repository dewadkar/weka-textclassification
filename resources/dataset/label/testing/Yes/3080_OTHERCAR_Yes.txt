            I bought this car about 9 months ago. I really love the car. It is fully loaded, has tons of power, and the four wheel independant suspention option really allows you to step on the gas in a corner. It is also very safe, large, four wheel abs, and dual airbags. As a guy who is 6'3" I need a large car with room and having a car that fits me and all my stuff, while still being able to lay some rubber and smoke most family cars at a light. Ok, so it doesn't have a leather interior, but it is still luxurious. Nice sound system with 8 speakers, a computer that tells average fuel economy...., a/c, pwr. everything. It is the perfect car.
Perfect accept for its flaws....The two most common problems with intrepids are all costly. The tranny, and a/c. I bought the car from elderly people with 60,000 miles on it. They had all the repair records and they spent a few thousand over the years repairing the a/c. So it did have a/c problems (that dodge couldn't correctly diagnous) but that was there problem, the a/c has been fine since I have had it. The tranny however is a differnt story. It is gonna go shortly. Before it warms up (in mornings or cooler weather) It shifts really hard into second gear. First delays, and then throws it into gear. It has started doing this at other times as well (high RPMs). So I fear I will need a new tranny. When I bought it I also replaced two tie rod ends. However, I think my small town repair shop screwed me and it wasn't needed. Many intrepids make a noise when going over bumps, it sounds like an unhealthy thumping noise. They thought it was the tie rod ends, but it was really a sway bar. It isn't a problem though many intrepids make the noise. All my friends comment on the noise, but i don't even notice it anymore, it's normal. But are you willing to put up with it?? However, no rattles inside the car (as far as dashboard...) Also, I needed to replace the lower head gasket. I smartened up and took it to the dealer. It cost $600 but they told me they never saw the lower gasket go before. So you probably don't need to worry about it!
