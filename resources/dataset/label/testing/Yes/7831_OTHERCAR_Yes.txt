            After purchasing a new 1989 Nissan Maxima SE and making substantial payments for 5 years, I decided to try a 3 year lease on a new 1996 Nissan Maxima, with the intention of offsetting the increasing cost of this wonderful car.  In August 1999 when the lease expired, I was without a car and was undecided as to what to do next.  

All my life I wanted a convertible, but for various reasons, like the cost and the compromised security (ease of access to a thief or vandal), I always talked myself out of it, settling for a sunroof. Becoming discouraged in my quest to find a fun, quality new car at an AFFORDABLE price, my Dad asked me if I had considered a quality used car? Hesitant at first, the more I thought about the idea the better it sounded, leading me to purchase my 1993 Nissan 240SX SE Convertible. I found one in great condition with just over 63,000 miles.

After owning this car for about a week, my only regret was waiting 25 years to buy my first convertible!  Having become accustomed to the Maxima's V-6 fuel injection engine, I was concerned about stepping down to a 4 cylinder with an automatic transmission. Although it didn't compare to the power of the Maxima's V-6, I was pleasantly surprised.  This car handles great, has decent pick up, and only takes about 30 seconds to put the top up or down.  My 7 year old daughter thinks it's great too since there are no air bags, allowing her to sit in the front seat.  

This car turns a lot of heads, and you seldom see one like it on the road.  I did have to replace the rear brake rotors due to a previous owner's neglect, and have had a hinge break on either side of the metal frame of my convertible top just above front seat head level. To replace the complete framework of the top is over $1900, so I have had to be quite creative. Also, due to the age of the car, I have been unable to locate mud flaps for my wheel wells from Nissan due to them no longer being made. I get between 18-20 miles per gallon around town, which is about the same as the mileage I got with my Maxima.  Counting my 1978 Datsun 280Z, this is my 4th Nissan/Datsun. <br><br>
