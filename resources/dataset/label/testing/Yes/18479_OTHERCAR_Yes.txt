            I inherited our Cutlass (4 cylinder) from my Dad. We have had it three years and I have to tell you it's a phenomenal car. My Dad took excellent care of it as do we, but besides that we've noticed:
Its great on gas consumption
Very smooth ride
Power steering very light
The only thing we don't like about it is our car doesn't have reclining seats, which are really missed on a long road trip.

Two years ago we  did a 6000 mile road trip. The only thing that happened was we got a flat tire! One part of our trip was driving through the Nevada Desert. It was June and it was a scorcher outside. All along the highway we noticed cars pulled over overheated with the hoods up. Our car just sailed right through, no problems. I might add a lot of the car that had overheated were all late model cars and vans.

We were very impressed with how well our car performed.

This year we had thought of buying a new car, (just to have a brand new car)but decided against it. So we had a new paint job done on ours as it was starting to rust in spots, and have decided to keep it until it literally falls apart. I'm just sorry they don't make them anymore.
