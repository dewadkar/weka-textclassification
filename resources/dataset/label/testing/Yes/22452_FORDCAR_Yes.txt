            The last pickup I owned was a 1981 Toyota.  It was ok, small 4 cyl., but it was the diesel.  It lunched out in 35,000 miles.
Well after the kids moved out I convinced my wife we needed a pickup.  I will explain the reasons in a few sentences.

I bought a 1999 Ranger XLT SuperCab. It has the 4.0 liter engine and the 5 speed manual transmission. It is the platinum gray.  I bought the vehicle to get me to the better hunting areas in the Rockies, to haul water in a 200 gal. tank and to take advantage of off-road experiences in Colorado. So far it has performed very well.  All expectations have been met.

I love the looks of the truck.  I have added a spray in liner, large 31 inch tires and a custom air filter system. Also love the sound system.  Quite a bit better than my 94' Intrepid's which this replaced. I like the high stance of the truck.  Great view of the road. It handles very nice on and off the road.  This truck has been over many off-road passes in excess of 10,000 ft. elevation that are rated as class 3-4 with no real problems. Mud, rocks, loose dirt, sand, and water to the bumper.  You name it, it has been thru it.  It hauls the 200 gal of water very well and water is 8.3lb per gal.  I have had the truck loaded with water and people to the tune of almost a ton. It is rated for under 1,500lb so that says something.  I will not tell you to do that every day or for long distances, but the truck has delivered.

I think the suspension could use some upgrade.  The shocks are ok but I do not like the ride on a real washboard road.  I will upgrade them this spring. So far only 2 minor problems, wipers start on their own and door ajar light stayed on. Both fixed by dealer.

I have 24,000 miles on the truck since last January.  It is running great.  It is comfortable for a guy my size, 6'3&quot; and 270lb.  It handles well in traffic and holds its own off-road.

If you want a deal, good value and quality for a reasonable price, the Ranger is for you.<br><br>
