            I can remember in high school when the 1990 4Runners came out and dreaming about being able to afford one. Well the time finally came and I picked up a loaded red 94 SR5 4x4 with tan leather and all available options.

My objectives when buying my 4Runner were to find a high mileage example with lots of options, lift it, and drive/enjoy it.  I did just that, found a LOADED (w/ all paperwork) example with 120k miles for a very good price.  As soon as I took ownership of it I added 15x10 wheels, 31x10.50 tires, 3&quot; lift, and some other ancillary items and upgrades.

I LOVED the look of the truck with the wheel/tire/lift package but the only drawback was that it KILLED the power!  The already overtaxed V6 did not like the aerodynamically challenging 3&quot; lift or the fatter wheels and tires.  This hurt not only my around town power but my gas mileage as well.

If I had it to do over again, I would set the truck up the same way because it just looked SO sweet - but if you get a 4Runner don't expect it to get great gas mileage and give you great performance; just expect it to haul a good amount of stuff and look GREAT doing it!<br><br>
