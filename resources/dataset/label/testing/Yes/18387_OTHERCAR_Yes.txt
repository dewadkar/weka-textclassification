            With the birth of our third child we decided that the old Ford Tempo just wasn't going to get it done anymore so we joined the "minivan generation."  A good friend of mine (who is a car salesman) found this LS model and said that he thought it was a good vehicle.  So far we have been very pleased except for a few minor quirks--at least one of which I haven't been able to understand.

First, I'm very pleased with the look of the vehicle.  Ours is dark green with the gold around the bottom.  The dark windows and the full dash headlights make it a very sporty-looking minivan. (not that I usually care too much what a vehicle looks like!)

The best thing for us, so far, has been the comfort.  The seats are very comfortable, it is easy to get in/out even with children 5, 3, and newborn all using their age-appropriate car seats.  The ergonomics for the driver are more than adequate.  I like the fact that this van is extra wide (wider wheel base than most vans)--this not only improves the handling, it also provides extra room inside.  One thing that has really struck me about the van is how easy it is to open/close all the doors.  The driver/passenger doors open/close with almost no effort at all (but I would expect that), but the large sliding door on the side and the rear hatch door also are so easy to open/lift/slide that my 5 year old can operate any of the doors easily, and my 3 year old isn't far from being able to do the same.

I do have a concern about the fact that the model has had a history of header/exhaust problems.  I'm not sure how that will turn out, but I'm at least aware of the problem.  One other thing I have noticed is a strong smell of fresh gasoline whenever I let the van idle with the heater/defroster on for any period of time.  This could problably be related to the headers, but I don't think so.  This is also a complaint of others who have owned this model.

All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the van.  We bought ours in fantastic cosmetic shape with 82000 miles.  Only time will tell if we got our money's worth.
