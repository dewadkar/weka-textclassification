            I have had my 1992 Prelude S for just over 3 years now.  It really looks good for being 8 years old.  I have had a few problems although minor.  My radiator cracked and had to be replaced, and I also had to replace the distributor.  Other than that it has been pretty much problem free.  I would however suggest that you pay the extra money and get the VTEC, though the Si would not be a bad choice.  The VTEC is just a much more fun motor to drive.  It is just extremely rev-happy.  Once it gets to 5600 rpm or so it feels like a turbo kicks in and the engine revs quickly to redline, and it also sounds really good.  The car just loves to revved.  To really have fun in it, you have to drive it like it is stolen, because the prelude is very well mannered at low rpm.  Enough about the engine, the prelude has also been named the best handling front wheel drive car.  The bottom line is the prelude is an inexpensive and fun car to own.  <br><br>
