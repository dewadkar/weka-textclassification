            Our Bonneville is so nice. We always get complements wherever we go!  We have a 1992 4 door!  We also have power locks and windows and a power seat!  My husband is very tall and I ma short and this feature is sooo great to have!  We can fit 6 in the car with seatbelts on, but it isn't too comfy like that.  Five seems to be the max for us!  We have had the car for 4 years and have had no problems.  We change the oil and tires...and it is great!  I like the car because it is just the right size for both my husband and I to drive.  I prefer a small car and he likes a large BOAT...and this seems just right!  I can still park it and he is still comfortable.  We are looking into buying another one...this time NEW!  We also get great gas mileage and a smooth and quiet ride!<br><br>
