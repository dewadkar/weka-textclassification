            When the Hyundai Tiburon first came out, it was to replace the South Korean's original sports coupe , the Scoupe.  Redesigned for 2003, the new Tiburon continues the automakers tradition of long warranties, and sporty styling at a reasonable price.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The word "Tiburon" is Spanish for shark, a name very befitting to such an aggressively styled car.  Styling cues from Ferrari's 456M and even a hint of Ford Mustang is apparent in the styling.  For such an inexpensive car, who would have thought a South Korean automaker could design such a beautiful car!

<b>INTERIOR</b>: Engine noise from both the 4-cylinder and the V6 is loud only under full throttle.  The optional 17-inch wheels produce a LOT of tire noise.  The 16-inch wheels are not as loud, but I feel they should be quieter.  The dashboard is very stylish and the controls are easy to reach.  The seats are bit too low, but this generates good head clearance even for tall driver like myself.  The sunroof does intrude on headroom somewhat, for me anyway.  In general, the front seats are comfortable, but I would like to have more lumbar support for longer trips.  The rear seats are almost unusable.  It is very difficult to get in and out of the back.  I found this little warning about the back seat quite amusing.  It warned that "anyone over 5-foot 6 may bang their head against the roof or rear window".  I guess that means most men and some women are not invited to the back seat!  The Tiburon has a convenient hatchback design and split-folding rear seats.  Unfortunately, with only 14.7 cubic feet of cargo space, ALL of the Tiburon's hatchback competitors offer more cargo room.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The Tiburon has 2 different available engine options.  The standard engine is a 2.0-liter DOHC inline 4-cylinder engine.  It produces 140 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, and 133 lb./ft. of torque at 4,800 rpm.  Even with the 5-speed manual transmission, I do not expect there to be enough power or low-end torque to move the 2,940-pound Shark.  If you decide to buy the Tiburon with the 4-cylinder and the optional 4-speed automatic transmission expect tepid acceleration, and little torque for highway passing.  Avoid this model at all costs.  For an extra $2,000, you can get a 2.7-liter DOHC V6 engine that puts out 181 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, and 177 lb./ft. of torque at 4,000 rpm.  Although this is a much needed horsepower and torque gain over the 4-cylinder, the V6 is not as powerful as the Tiburon's rivals.  The V6 with the 6-speed weighs only 3,015 pounds and effectively turns the Tiburon into an exciting sports car.  The 4-speed automatic does come with a manual-shift gate (called "Shiftronic"), but I have no use for it.  If I want a manual, I will BUY a manual.  Fuel economy for such a small V6 engine was worse than expected, but both engines use regular fuel.  I averaged 17.8 mpg, but this was probably due to the fact that I was driving pretty hard.  In normal driving, however, 20.5 mpg was my average.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The new Shark was made to be a sports car and that is exactly what it is.  The 16-inch tires take corners with aplomb, but with the 17-inch wheels, handling is comparable to that of much more expensive sports cars.

<b>RIDE</b>: The 16-inch wheels are tolerable, but still stiff over most bumps.  The low-profile high-performance tires mounted on the 17-inch wheels make the ride jittery over broken surfaces and potholes.  Although the V6 models come with the jarring 17-inch wheels, fortunately you can get the 4-cylinder models 16-inch wheels as a $140 credit option.  Again, try it before you buy it!

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Hyundais have been in the American market since 1986 and since then, reliability has improved somewhat.  Unfortunately, Hyundai has recalled 1,174 (so far) Tiburons for a safety defect.  For more information see this website:

<b>VALUE</b>: The new Tiburon may not be as fast as its competitors or as practical but IS worth a test drive if you are looking for a fun, sporty compact coupe.
