            I purchased my Polaroid PDC700 about a year ago and have been pleased with its performance.  I didn't want to spend $600 on a digital camera, but I did want images that I could print.  This camera satisfies my shutterbug needs, both on vacation and at home.

<b>=)</b> I love that it has an LCD viewer on the back.  Being able to preview your photo is sooo helpful.  If you cut someone's head off, no problem, just retake the shot.

<b>=)</b> Flash has an "off" mode, so you can take pictures in museums and historical places where flash isn't permitted.  This was extremely helpful while on vacation in Spain, where flash photography is prohibited in many places.

<b>=)</b> My camera came with a serial port upload, which is slow (about 1 image a minute), but other packages offer a faster USB upload.  I've also used a Universal Card Reader for quick, drag & drop loading.  I just start the upload process and walk away.

<b>=)</b>  This camera's not overloaded with features the first-time-user won't use.  There's enough flexibility through the menu: lighting balance, set time & date, auto shut off, manual play images through the TV cable attachment, resolution indicator, battery power indicator, image counter, etc.

<b>=)</b> Camera has an internal memory, and accepts Compact Flash cards for limitless memory capability.  I purchased two 32MB Compact Flash cards, and can take nearly 200 photo-quality images on each card at the default resolution.

<b>=)</b> At the default resolution, you can print good quality 4x6 prints, and acceptable 5x7 prints.  Enlarging to 8x10 gets a little fuzzy, but I have one 8x10 that looks good from a distance.  How many 8x10's do you really print anyway????

<b>=)</b> Once I got past the poor instruction card, I found the features easy to use.  If you need detailed instructions you'll be frustrated.  I just started pressing buttons to see what would happen, and figured it out just fine.

<b>=)</b> USE NIMH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES with <i>any</i> digital camera.  All digital cameras drink battery juice, especially if you use the LCD screen as a viewfinder.  Buy two complete sets of batteries and you'll never be powerless!  I took my rechargeables to Spain with a plug adapter (European countries have 220V) and they recharged just fine.  One set of 4 batteries lasted an entire day of touring.

<b>=)</b> Take pictures like there's no tomorrow and review your images at the end of the day.  Use the LCD screen to review what you've taken, delete the images you don't want to free up memory on your Compact Flash card.

<b>=)</b> Use the included PhotoMax software to retouch reflection off of eyeglasses, crop, copy / paste and do all sorts of neat things with digital images.


<b>I've learned to work with the few shortcomings of this model...</b>

<b>=(</b> My nose presses the "m" menu button, so when I press the shutter, instead of taking the picture, it changes the resolution setting from high to low.  I just have to watch what I'm doing.

<b>=?</b> Sometimes the LCD screen doesn't come on to preview the picture I've just taken.  Haven't figured out why, and it doesn't do it all the time.

<b>=(</b> The camera case is flimsy and doesn't have room for anything but the camera.  I would have liked room to store extra Compact Flash cards, and maybe an extra set of batteries.

<b>=(</b> The processor could be faster...this means you can't take another picture until the first one is done processing...about a 10 second wait.

<b>=(</b> Make sure you get a USB cable to upload your images.  Serial uploads are just too slow.

This camera did a really nice job.  I'll use it for years to come, until the higher-resolution cameras come down in price.  Visit my Spain photo page for sample photos taken with this camera...I think you'll agree it does an acceptable job!!  Copy / paste the link below to see my photos:
