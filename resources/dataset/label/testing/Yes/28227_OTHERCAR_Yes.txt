            Why did we buy it?

We bought our '99 Durango on December 31 at 6:30PM After the timing belt busted on our last car.  We had owned a Dakota pickup a couple of years before,but it didn't completly fit our needs.  After being without a 4 wheeldrive, we felt we needed to get back into one.  We did  love the Dakota and have found the Durango everything the Dakota was and more.  We have now put on 17000 miles and none of them foolish.  We put a hole in the gas tank of our van last year driving to go white water rafting in Salmon, Idaho.  This year we cruised over small boulders and had plenty of power with the 360 cu. in. engine. Any V8 is going to take a little more gas, but this one surprised us at 21 mph on the trip.  We even pulled a small, loaded down trailer without even a grown or a whimper.  I found it could accelerate up a 10 degree incline up Jackson Hole Pass to Jackson, Wyoming. I won't tell you how fast we got going, but I kept up with a little BMW sportster.   It even held the curves very descently, it had very minimal sway.  My wife drives 20 miles to teach a a small junior college nearby.  She drives it on the cold snowy mornings when things get really slick and bad.  She loves it and wants to keep it all winter.  The shift on the fly is great.  <br><br>
