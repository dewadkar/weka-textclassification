            We purchased a 95 Ford Bronco in Jan 99 with very high miles on it.  We only have had one problem with it and that was the fuel pump needed to be replaced.  It now has 172k and it is still going strong.  It is definitely a rugged truck.  Where we live you need to have a truck for the dirt roads and many potholes.  We had the shocks replaced (only because our mechanic recommended) and they were the original factory shocks.  I do not have any complaints about his truck!  They are very difficult to find and now I can understand why.  If you have ever owned one you will not want to get rid of it.  My husband said he would replace everything on it before he would give it up.  It does take the bumps kind of rough, but that is compared to the Lincoln Towncar he had previously.  The kids get a big kick out of it because they can see over the sides of the bridge when we cross the many in our town.  Also you don't have a problem with other peoples lights in your eyes.  The automatic dimmer on the rearview mirror is awesome.  I never have to worry about those big bright semi lights glaring in my eyes at night.  On the down side it does require quite a few more trips to the gas station than the Lincoln. I would strongly recommend if you can find one that is in good shape, get it!!<br><br>
