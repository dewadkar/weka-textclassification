            My husband bought me an brand new olds in 1994. I still own that car. It is the most realiable car that I have ever owned. My next car that I purchase will be another olds. I have only had very few problems with my car since we bought it. It has very good brakes and runs like a kitten. I would recommend anyone to buy one of these cars. I value my money and this car is your moneys worth. My daughter loves my car so much that we both her an '90 olds, it runs just as good as my car but does have some things that are different about them. Even though her car has an never motor they are just the same. The outside it the only thing that is the major difference.<br><br>
