            I reciently purchesed a 97 Dodge stealth R/T turbo with AWD (all wheel drive) and all wheel stearing. Chrysler and Mitsibishi got together agin and came up with identical running cars. First of all the Stealh is not name right because the last thing youll do in this car is blend in, the well defined lines flow nicley and are uninteruped by the mirrors plus the long low look draws attention from any mustang or Camaro. Now to move on to the performance, myslef being a young student i do some stupid stuff like drag race and ive out ran a 2000 Mustand cobra and a 1998 Camaro SS by a good margin but not only is this car fast its handling is excllent the all wheel stearing makes the stealth able to take a 90 degree turn at 70 miles an hour. Plus with the AWD the car out handels any other sports car in dry and wet driving conditions makeing it safer in most aspects than a standerd RWD sports car the AWD only comes on the turbo models and from what ive heard the FWD models tend to pull on hard accleration if you are looking for unmatched performance in a affordabill price range look at the stealth its a best buy<br><br>
