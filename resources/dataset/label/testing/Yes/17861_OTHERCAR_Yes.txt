            just leased a 2000 4door 4 wheel drive blazer.  leased it due to good experience with a 97 blazer which we traded.  the four wheel brakes are exceptional.  have never had brakes so exacting and quick reacting.  just got back from a trip to Virginia where my brother owns 140 acres at approx. 3000 foot elevation.  both the 4wd hi and low worked exceptionally well on his one mile driveway which is tough to manuver and you can't afford to slip more than 2 or 3 feet in either direction.  a slip in the wrong direction could have taken you on a ride down the side of the mountain you hadn't intended.  handled extremely well.  handled well on Interstate 8l with all its ups and downs.  Plenty of pickup to keep ahead of the tractor trailers on the downgrades.  Ride is just about as comfortable as any car.  averaged about 20 miles to the gallon on the 900 mile trip {some of that local and in four wheel drive mode}.  as i mentioned, this is my second blazer, and so far it exceeds my expectations.  If you're into 4wd with comfort included I would highly recommend.
