            The Expedition is a great SUV.  Don't let it's size intimidate you.  I love the that it handles, the ride is exceptionally smooth.  The large tires hold the road very well, and the optional all-time four wheel drive is also a great feature.  As far as off-roading, it shines.  If you are interested in a true sport ute then this is your car, but, like most others, it doesn't return very good gas mileage.  As far as space, there aren't many that can compare.  The three rows of seats provide room for up to eight people comfortably.  The rear seats also have climate control, with heat and air available to the two rows of back seats.  Also available is sound controls for the rear seats.  Keyless Entry is standard on all Expeditions.<br><br>
