            For an 8 passenger family super van you just can't beat it !! If you do your homework and compare this van to ALL the other available mid-sized vans, the GMC Safari will always come out on top. Roomy comfort is the name of the game with plenty of power from the standard Vortec 6 cylinder engine. After you make your purchase load it up and take a trip up the California coast. You'll be surprised at all the fun you'll have.
The rear 3 door &quot;Dutch&quot; doors are of perfect design. You'll even enjoy opening and closing them. The rear net comes in handy for jugs of milk and things you don't want to roll around.
Actually this is the ONLY mid-sized rear drive van left on the market. So the towing ability is outstanding for the price.<br><br>
