            Our family has a tendency to keep cars for a long time, and our last vehicle, an 89 Toyota Corolla, is just one in a long line of cars that we have driven into the ground - literally.  And we expect our lil' 2000 black Protoge LX to live up to the high standards the Corolla (aka &quot;The Frigate&quot;), and our last workhorse, an 87 VW Jetta with 400,000+ kms on the odo, set for us.  So far, we are pleasently surprised at the Protege's practicality and sheer fun-to-drive factor.  

Proteges come in three flavours:  The base SE (or ES in the US)is equipped with a 1.6L 4 banger and some extra goodies like a CD player.  Up a level is the LX with a gutsy 1.8L 4 cylinder engine with even more options, like power locks and windows and cruise control.  If you want to show off, there's the LX Touring Edition, which comes with a spoiler, rims and a power sunroof.  My dad, the eternal cheapskate, liked the SE's low sticker, but felt the 1.8L engine was worth the extra dough.  And in a rare lapse of cheapness, my dad splurged for a spoiler - a must-have, since the spoiler turns the car from doopy utilitarian to a quasi-sports car.  The Touring Package is tempting, but costly.  The sticker can skyrocket quickly, with the high end LX approaching $28,000CAN, and that is wandering deep into Jetta territory.

The car is roomy inside, and the car's exterior hides the cavernous interior.  Strap yourself behind the wheel, and you're greeted by the usual speedo and tach and an uncluttered instrument panel.  The stereo is high on the dash and is logical to use, although the buttons are difficult when you have gloves on.  Ventilation controls are logical and straight forward.  Fit and finish is excellent, and compares favourably to the Corollas and Civics that are built a few hours from where we live.  Trunk room is large and the back seats fold down to turn the Protege into the perfect IKEA-mobile.  Safety is supplied by dual front airbags and the industry standard crumple zones - Interesting to note that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (www.iihs.org) rated the Protege highly in its crash tests.  Aside from a large shelf-like slopping dash, there really isn't anything spectacular - until you get in the back.  The rear-seat legroom is surprising, although the seats are firm enough to make Germans complain.

But that's okay, because your backseat cohorts will be too busy hanging on for dear life than whining.  The Protege is an absolute blast to drive, with the 1.8L's acceleration surprisingly quick.  Tap the gas pedal, and the car jumps into action, inducing whiplash in your passengers (lots of fun to watch in the rearview mirror).  With the car's light steering and small turning radius, the Protege is the perfect warrior in downtown Toronto traffic.  In fact, the whole car is geared for the heavy footed driver in all of us - responsive engine, light steering, firm seats, and even firmer suspension.  At the test drive, flatten the gas at stoplights or push the car into corners and you'll have a big grin on your face by the time you get back to the dealership.

However, the sporty side of the Protege also causes some problems.  The engine, although having plenty of ooomph, lacks some refinement.  The steering is too light and the brakes are mushy - more communication with the driver is needed.  The firmness of the car is a little unsettling and I found myself jarred along some of Ontario's finer potholes.  For a 4 cylinder engine, the Protege is quite thirsty - but complaining about it would likely get you beat up by angry Suburban and Excursion owners.  Our automatic transmission does the job well, although it's not the slickest shifter out there.  We've also had some problems with our month-old baby - the trunk refused to open.  For a few days we couldn't remedy the problem but eventually it fixed itself and the rest of us are totally perplexed.  Mazda has had some quality issues in the past few years, but the Protege comes with a reasonable warranty.  Only time will tell.

All these issues are bettered by the new Toyota Corolla, which explains why Mazda dealers don't like it when you use the &quot;T&quot; word.  But even with the Corolla's new VVTi engine (stolen from the Lexus division), I believe the Protege is a better buy.  The roomy interior, great looks and the sheer fun-to-drive factor makes the Protege a clear winner.  My family's other car is a 99 Chevrolet Malibu that was purchased for sentimental reasons (our 1978 Malibu lasted for 10 years) and already we're fighting over the keys to the Protege. For us, a car is more than a form of transportation, it's a part of the family - so you can be sure that we took a long time to decide on a new car.  With our Mazda Protege, we have no regrets and look forward to spending a long time with our new arrival.
