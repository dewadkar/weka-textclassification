            This was to be my truck replacing my 11 year old Dodge 1/2 ton pickup.  We purchased the new Ford on a Saturday afternoon in Austin, Texas after shopping several different dealers as well as several different makes.  After driving the Ford the decision became easy for my wife and I to make.  Truthfully, it only took my wife a couple of weeks to sort of take the new Ford to drive, again leaving me with our second car to get to and from work in.  

The interior just felt as if you were being given a comforting hug.  The color scheme is pleasant and easy on the eyes.  The instrument cluster is composed of analog gauges that are easy to observe and arranged nicely in the dashboard.  The controls for the radio, tape deck, air conditioning, cruse control, turn indicators, electric door locks, electric windows and the electric mirrors are all easy to reach and operate from the driving position. The third door is an added feature that really grows on a person.  Practically eliminating the need to fold the front seats forward for access to the back seat.

The F-150, 4.2 L, V-6 has considerably more pep than I expected.  The mileage per gallon of fuel averages 17.5.  I believe that number could be improved by Ford.  Ford's choice of installing Fire Stone tires leaves a little to be desired.  However, to date I've had no problems with them. 

I would encourage anyone interested in buying a pickup to give the F-150 some serious consideration before making their final choice.  We would definitely buy it again.
