            ...because I don't want you buying one and either making them scarce or driving up the price for them on the used car market.

<i>Post Edit 07/11:  Yes, I know this Corsica review is under Cavalier.  For some reason they scr@wed up and moved it here.  The Corvettes appear in the Corsica category.  So rather than me reposting this again in the Corsica category, I imagine they will clear this up on their own.  If they don't by August 1, I'll take care of it. - Jeff </i>

<b>Why I Bought It</b>

I am the car buyer that all dealers hate, because when I go to buy a car, I already know exactly which models I'll look at and I know more about them - features, price points, etc. - than their salespeople do.

In 1996, after extensive research, I found a '95 Corsica (which rolled off the line in Oct. 94) with 20K on it. It was perfect.  It met all of my basic criteria which were:  1) six-cylinder, 2) reliability, 3) power everything, 4) price, 5) large trunk, 6) split folding rear seat, 7) four door.

The other car I was looking at was a 95 6-cyl Taurus and a 94 6-cyl Lumina Euro.  I loved the Taurus too, but the Corsica was under $12000 and the Taurus was over $16000.  The Lumina was eliminated because it did not handle as well and looked dated.


<b>Six Cylinder <i>Rocks</i></b>

The 3.1 six-cylinder engine (which was put into the 93-96 models) is the same base engine that comes standard on the big Buicks, the Pontiac Grand-Prix and the Luminas of the same time period. Since the Corsica is so small and light, the 3.1 engine turns this car into a pocket rocket.  I leave 4 cyl Accords, Camrys, and Saturns in the dust.


<b>Condition</b>

Now my Corsica has 87K mi on it. In over 4 years, I've spent about $2000 on it in maintenance (including regular maintenance, oil changes, brakes, tires, etc.) to keep it in flawless, perfect condition.  $500 per year for those things is low for having put over 67000 mi on it during that period like I did.


<b>Negatives</b>

All the Corsicas (and other Chevys for that matter) built with this engine have a slow oil leak.  Not really a leak, but a 'sweat' according to my third cousin's fiancee who is a really skilled mechanic specializing in Corvettes and Chevys.  

In addition, mine had a manufacturer's defect which showed up only recently - a transmission fluid exchange hose blew off because of a weak connector.  Luckily, there was no permanent damage to the transmission.  

Corsicas are also known to lose their paint in large flecks.  Mine has been losing small unnoticable flecks.  But so what?  If it gets bad, just go to Maaco and get it taken care of.  I touch them up myself.

Additionally, Chevys in general from that time period are known to start having electrical system problems at around 100K.  I am expecting to put $200-$400 into it in the next year for that.


<b>Positives (besides what I already told you)</b>

Compared with other cars in its class, especially newer ones, the interior is very high quality.

You don't have to worry about this car being stolen if you live in a major metropolitan area.  It's a very nice car, but it just doesn't have much sex appeal.


<b>In Conclusion</b>

I love my Corsica.  I even find the maroon interior endearing.  I want to buy another of the latest model (96) for my wife.  It's an excellent choice if you're focusing on power and price.  As of 5/1/00, used, good condition, 6-cyl, 96s (last model year - they were discontinued) with power everything and &lt;50,000 mi were going for under $7000.

As far as I know, the only other American cars worth buying with those specs in that price range are the 95 Dodge Spirit, 95 Dodge Shadow ES, and 97 Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra (all way less attractive looking).


<b>Warning!!!</b>

Do NOT buy the 4-cylinder version.  I REPEAT: DO NOT BUY the 4-cylinder version.  They are lethargic and the engine wears out way sooner.
