            I have had this car since August of 2000 and it has been my first car. I love this car, and the only problem that it has given my was that I had to change the valve covers because they were leaking oil. This car has withstood my wrath for about 8 months and it's doing fine so far, I will have it repainted in the spring because the paint is fading.It's a little tight in the back, but who cares its not a family car. As for the speed, this car eclipse can pull around a 9 second 0-60 and about a 14 second 1/4 mile, the next car I am going to get after this one is a 3000GT.
