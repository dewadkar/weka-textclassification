            Mine is a UK Model 2000 4.0 limited - I live in England.  Bought the car with 30000 miles and full dealer history.  Have travelled more than 10000 miles with no major problems.  It's not too fast or too slow, it's comfortable (for the type of car).  I bought it because I wanted the extra space to carry stuff for my various hobbies, and I live in an area where snow and ice aren't cleared often if at all in Winter.  This aspect hasn't been tested yet - but I have made use of the load carrying ability and am very pleased with it.

The car gets about 19-20 (Imperial not US) Miles to the gallon, but I have no complaints as I knew to expect this when I bought it and had budgeted accordingly.

I am particularly impressed with the heated leather seats, the stereo and the climate control/aircon system.

My only minor niggles are the seatbelt chime - I always buckle up and preferred the warning light only in previous cars, and the fact that the key is needed for the fuel filler cap - but these are hardly major!

The only oddity with the car is that although it has the memory keys 1 and 2 to identify each driver, the radio seems to "forget" who I am about one time in twenty or so and tunes the radio to nothing in particular - again not major.

I looked at a Ford Explorer (didn't like the ride, limited headroom - I'm 6'5"), and Range Rover (expensive and not enough headroom) before choosing my Jeep.
