            Well, I just had to let everybody know about this vehicle. At first I was apposed to buying a Minivan. A gutless, Slow moving, Ugly, VW Bug passing, Elderly people honking at you to move over so they can pass vehicle. Well, Was I in for a shock! This has to be the most comfortable Minivan I have been in or taken for a test drive. And I should know, my wife has been bugging me for one for years now. I was first impressed with the comfort and ease it was for me to drive. And it�s not easy with me being over 6 foot and all legs. Next came on the test drive when I found out how much power it has. My wife hates it when I do it, but I hate it when other drivers swerve around you at a light in order to cut you off. Haha, Not with this! I love all the power goodies you get with it too. Power seats, Power door locks, Power sliding door. All controlled with a remote. No more fumbling with the keys to get the kids in. No more having to put down the groceries on the ground to open the door. I love it! The radio has a feature with it so the passengers in the back can listen to a CD with headphones while the front can enjoy the radio. There are so many programmable options that you have to mess with, But once you figure out how you like it then it�s great. The one thing I don't like is the auto headlights. When I come home at night and we pull up to the front gate it is Customary to drop down to the running lights as not to blind the guard. Well, with this you can't! There is no way to cut the lights. The light switch is almost a useless option. At night the light are on, During the day the running lights are on. No choice. They love us at the drive-In. But don't let this turn you away from this. I like the option that when you close the last door it automatically locks all the doors. With the key out of the ignition of course. There is just too much I love about it. If you find a good deal on this or find yourself having to rent one the remember this. Thanks for your time
