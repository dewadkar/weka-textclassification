            I recently purchased the Sony Mavica FD91 and have, so far, found it to be an easy digital camera to operate.  The zoom lens has great power and excellent clarity at full zoom.  I have been happy will the quality of the pictures that I have recently taken of my new grandson and have been able to e-mail them to others who marvel at the quality of the pictures.  Sony could, however, provide some type of protection for the LCD screen on the back of the camera.  Maybe a thin piece of plastic that could be cleaned with any window cleaner or water.  The flash could also be a little stronger or a connection for another flash.<br><br>
