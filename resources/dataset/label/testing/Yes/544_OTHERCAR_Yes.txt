            I purchased this car about 5 months ago.  It has been nothing but wonderful.  This car is great on gas mileage, I drive a lot and it stands up so wonderful throughout all this. 

I got the upgraded package with this vehicle and my only complaint about this car is that Hyundai doesn't warranty the tires, it is warranted through the tire manufacture..which is quite a hassle when my tire split apart and put me in the middle of no where with my children in the back...I thank god that with the wonderful warranty that comes along with this car there is road side assistance for 5 years, I called them and they were there for me within 20 minutes and I got a new tire, my only problem was getting reimbursed for that through the manufacture of the tires.  

I think this car is the greatest, the safety of this vehicle is amazing, safety was the main feature I was interested when I was looking for a vehicle, I test drove over 30 different vehicles and went through 12 different dealers before I chose and I chose the best car that I have seen in a long time.  

I would recommend anyone looking for a reliable, safe, economical vehicle to take a look at the Accent at your local dealer. <br><br>
