            I bought this camera because I wanted a digital camera, but most of all I wanted a webcam and this camera had both. 

Picture Quality: 

The pictures turn out to be great and clear. If you just want reasonable quality pictures this is the camera for you. 

Battery Life: 

The two double A (AA) batteries last for about 250 shots (give or take a few if you use the flash) Overall they last for a long time. 

Memory: 

With the built in 7MB memory you can take between 14-17 pictures. I use a 64MB MMC memory card and I can take up to 145 pictures total. Thats all I need. 

Buttons and Operation: 

There are four major buttons on this camera which are: 
1. Power button - To turn on the camera 
2. Menu button - To toggle between the menu items 
3. Select button - To select menu items 
4. Trigger button - To take pictures 

Flash: 

The flash works automatically in most cases when it is turned on. If you don't have the flash the picture are dark in dark areas. 

Webcam Feature: 

This camera can also be used as a webcam. The only problem with this feature is that the webcam feed is really dark and you need a bright light on the area that is current in focus. Other than that it work great. 

Video clip feature: 

The video clip feature works like a charm but the clip quality is not that great. There are some noise in the clip. Sound is not supported in this camera. 

Overall: 

If you just need a camera to practice or play around with, this is the camera for you. For beginers, this is perfect. But if you want something ! more exc iting, I would recommend spending a little more money and getting a name brand digital camera with atleast 3MegaPixels.
