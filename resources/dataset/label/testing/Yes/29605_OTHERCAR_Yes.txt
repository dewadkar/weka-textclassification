            Not to insult Dodge, but as a long time GM man I always said hell would have to freeze over before I bought a Dodge. Turns out the coldest day of the year I found myself in a Dodge dealership looking for info on a Dakota. The salesman at the dealership in Youngstown, OH was quite helpful and accomodating, and did not apply any horse tradin' mojo that would've sent me skittering out the door...I guess he realized that I wouldn't be out on such a night if I wasn't serious. And I was, after looking at both Chev/GMC and Ford and deciding against them both. Ford must be quite proud of what they sell, and that is reflected in their price to value ratio. GM has some very impressive motors and a nice riding product, but the result of the design team inhaling too much White-Out has made the Chevy and GMC a couple of the homeliest trucks on the road. The Avalanche and Aztec should've been enough warning.

The Dakota Quad Cab was pretty close in price to the Ram, and I went in there to drive that originally. Nice, but narrow in the shoulder area. Well, the salesman said there was a reason he showed me the Dakota first...that was so I'd not wonder down the road what it was like...and he was sure I'd like the Ram better.

So we walk around the corner of the lot and there, idling in the frozen midwestern tundra was this beautiful, black '03 monster with a color keyed grille and a couple of discreet Hemi badges on the front fenders. Short bed, regular cab, 17" wheels, just a baaaad mothershutyourmouth!As we pull out of the lot, the salesman gives her a little juice, I see the red needle jump up on the white-faced tach, hear the roar, get pushed back in the seat, feel the rear end ever so slightly slip into the turning lane and simultaneously with the salesman dissolve into giggles...100 yards into the test drive I said, "Write it up!"

Nice, nice, nice. Tons of power, excellent handling, quiet interior, super fit and finish, smooth shifting, almost as much room in the regular cab as other brands' extended cabs...I finally found a vehicle to keep around for a loooong time. The four wheel drive is lever-operated, and is a bit tricky to get into 4 low, but smooth between 2hi and 4hi. It's not broken in yet, so I hope the gas mileage increases (almost 14 mpg city), but still isn't bad for a 5.7 4x4 comparatively. I sit up nice and high with a confidence-inspiring view of the road. The downside of the big regular cab is a pretty hefty blind spot looking over your shoulder when merging or exiting a highway, but I'll put up with that to not have my head banging on the rear window with the seat back enough from the wheel to be comfortable. Could use boards or nerf bars for shorter folk, as the cab is up there.

All in all, I love it. Great experience in the dealership, great experience on the road, and there's just nothing out there that tops this truck in the statement department. I'd get one again...hopefully it'll be a long time before the Mayor needs replaced. It's an '03 half ton. The year doesn't appear on the pull down menu.
