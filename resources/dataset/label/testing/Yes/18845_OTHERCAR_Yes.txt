            It's hard to write and read reviews on used cars; a lot depends on how the car was treated by its former owner(s).  On the plus side, the car in question gets some real time use, and the proof is in how well it's held up to 70k  miles of real use - none of this "20,000 miles and no problems!"  Well, I should hope so!  Add a 1 to the beginning of that number, *then* I'll really be impressed.

My own 1995 Monte Carlo LS has 160,000k on the odometer and runs like a dream (of course, it never hurts to knock on wood).  I know nothing of her history, having picked her up from a don't ask/don't tell car lot as a commuter car.  I do suspect she was a fleet car at one point - the number 6 has been written on the inside of the gas door.  I've never bothered to run a Carfax report - she was a bit of an impulse buy, and has given me no major problems.  Ever since I was a wee lass, I loved the 70s-80s version of the Monte Carlo, but I never really liked the newer two-door Lumina coupe version.  Until I opened the door and looked inside and heard this one whisper, "buuuy meeeee."  Now I appreciate the styling - it may be slightly bland, but it's timeless.

On a recent trip to Dallas, the 3.1 engine gave me a whopping 31.5mpg - the usual number is 27-29mpg with mixed highway/city/rural route driving.  The AOD tranny shifts firmly and decisively - it has never left me thinking, "Okay, shift now...now? shift please? Pretty please?  Thank you."  In the two years I've owned her, I've replaced a battery, put four new tires on her, replaced plugs and wires and an ignition coil pack, along with regular oil changes.  This car isn't a powerhouse or a speed demon, nor will it fling itself into the curves with a gusto, but if you ask for it, there's plenty of power for passing or getting yourself out of sticky situations.  This car is, to me, more of a comfy cruiser than a sporty coupe, what my mother calls "a road car."  Also of note: this car is the first car I've ever driven that feels completely stable on wet roads.  I'm usually a wimpy driver on wet roads, but the only things that slow me down in the rain when I'm driving the Monte are the possibility of standing water or reduced visibility.

Perhaps what impresses me the most is that there are absolutely NO squeaks or rattles.  This car is as solid as the day it rolled off the assembly line.  I've had several high mileage cars, and even the best of them developed some slight rattle somewhere as they aged.  The Monte is dead quiet.  Interior is plushy - I'm still not sure if the interior color is dark grey, black, or dark blue.  At times, it seems to be a mixture of all three.  Looks very nice, but shows long Collie hair.  The dash and door panels are graced with simulated wood grain panels that actually look pretty good.  The seats are still firm and comfortable, although it's a little cramped in the back seat.  The two front seats are seperated by a handy flip up console with a nice built in cup holder (but only one, unfortunately).  Gauge cluster includes a tach, which is something I demand even in a car equipped with an automatic transmission.  The doors are reassuringly thick; however, this comes at the expense of some interior room.  The back seats fold down, effectively expanding the trunk space.

The sound system is - and here I revert to my high school mentality - awesome.  I believe it's the base AC Delco cassette deck that was offered in the Monte, but the speakers and head unit output mind boggling sound quality.  It sounds better than some people's custom stereos.  I recently replaced the stock cassette player with a $400 Sony CD player - still sounds pretty good, but it sounded just a hair better before, even with my cheapie portable CD player and cassette adaptor plugged in.  If mirror shaking bass and being able to stand outside of your car and hear the music as well as if you were actually inside the car floats your boat, you'll love the Monte.

Okay, now the bad.  She *does* burn oil.  About half a quart between oil changes.  However, I have switched to a synthetic blend marketed for higher mileage vehicles, and the past few oil changes I have not had to add any.  We shall see if the synth takes care of the problem.  Secondly, blind spots.  Two big ones in the rear, caused by the thick rear pillars.  I have adjusted to mine, making sure the mirrors are aimed correctly and always double checking over my shoulder by actually turning my head, but this was an annoying and slightly scary thing to get used to.    

All in all, I love this car.  It's been the perfect vehicle.  I have been car shopping, and driving the Monte has spoiled me - every car I drove didn't quite measure up to her.  I finally purchased a Pontiac Grand Prix, and, as much fun as it is to drive, it's still not the car that the Monte is.  My Monte has been semi-decomissioned as a "spare" car and weekend cruiser.  If the time ever comes, I will not hesitate to replace her engine/transmission; this car is definitely a keeper.
