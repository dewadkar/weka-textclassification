              When my husband and i first started looking around for a new car we definately knew right away we wanted a SUV.  We were not sure which one though.  We used to own a Suzuki Sidekick and when we saw the Suzuki Grand Vitara we just knew we had to have it.  It had all the features that we were looking for...power windows, locks, brakes, steering...cruise control...a/c...automatic...4 doors(that was a big factor with 2 small children)...V6(my husband fell in love when he found out it had a V6).Then we bought it and have been driving it for about 4 months now and have had no problems whatsoever.  It runs just as good now as it did when we bought it.  
   Driving the GV actually doesnt feel like we are driving an SUV but rather a bigger car.  Our GV is a smooth driving automobile.  
   Another good thing about the Grand Vitara is that i am sort of on the shorter side but have no problems at all seeing everything behind me and beside me.  And my brother-in-law, who is huge fits into the GV easily.  So this little SUV is great for everybody of all sizes and ages.  And the Grand Vitara is excellent for family.  Having two small children both in car seats, they fit great in the backseat with plenty of room for another person.  And the passenger and driver have plenty of leg room up front. 
    This is just a great SUV to own.  Couldnt ask for anything better.
