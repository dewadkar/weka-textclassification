            This is my first SUV. Its a great feeling being up so high seeing over the other vehicles. I bought the 16 inch wheels which probably give you a little more height. If you don't like to be up high this is not the vehicle for you. The 4runner is as tight and quiet as any car I've driven. I am pleasantly surprised by the consistent manner in which it turns. I never feel that rolling feeling that some others have suggested. It is as smooth as silk for the size of the vehicle. I chose this over the ford explorer for two main reasons  1. The ride on the Toyota was much smoother to me. 2. I plan on keeping the truck for at least 10 years and so the Toyota reliability was my main reason for buying it. For the money the Ford came with more equipment and the four wheel drive system was more sophisticated, but to me reliability won out. I also received a fantastic price and service from Carorder.com. <br><br>
