            My husband and I bought a Honda Accord,at first we were not to sure of what kind of compact car we wanted to buy.We were looking for something a affordable and economical.It is not only economical and comfortable, it is also handles very well.We have also had the opportunity to take our Honda on a very long road trip across country,with no problems to mention.One of the reason we chose the Honda Accord is because we were expecting a child and looking for a four door car.We have really enjoy the Honda Accord and if anyone is looking for a compact car I suggest you see your local Honda Dealer.<br><br>
