             I must admit when i first saw this car in a auto show i was wondering who was manufacturing it and was looking for the jaguar on the hood!..I was very much surprised to see that hyundai was the proud constructor of this vehicule.
after a road test i was seduced by the luxury version or GLS with sun roof,heating mirrors,leather seats V6 engine to name a few characteristics of that car.r
Renting cars at least twice or 3 times /year,i have become very touchy about 
vehicules and i must say i highly recommend

 this one over similar models like the chrysler intrepid(poor visibility,hard to reach in trunk),the oldsmobile intrigue(poor acceleration) Pontiac grand Prix (poor handling in wintery conditions).
I did not buy this vehicule but i have a 4 year lease including free oil changes v.i.p. passport with coupons redeamables for service need be etc.So far i am very pleased to say that this car was only recalled once and stayed in for 15 minutes only..alldone with great courtesy,coffee at the service and a survey follow up...even better than nissan i must say!
Handling condition of this car winter-summer is very good breaking is good too even tough this vehicule is not equipped with abs(so better)�as for the driving position i find it excellent adjustable steering wheel of course and driver,s height driving position a good factor.Visibility is excellent good size mirrors,accessories easy to reach speciallly the hazard lights very well located in the middle of the console.Cell phone stay in the specially designed compartment and i love the roomy 2 section transmission compartment.trunk is roomy and 3/4 and i have moved somebody withhtis car.it is really incredible the quantity and size of the objects u can fit in..more than in my old hatchback.
Only thing that really bug me is the wiper control that i somehow always catch in and get the wipers going while tuning another station or changing a cd"other thing i would appreciate is the instrument panel light going on while  driving in a tunnel(we have many of those in montr�al).
But to conclude this is a great car an excellent value for the money very comfortable and so far very reliable .
I would recommend iteven though my next lease will be the recntly introduced xg300,even more luxurious.
