            This car has raised the bar in cheap cars.  They seem very durable if you have ever seen lethal weapon four.  In the movie it seems you can drive through a building and run over everything and keep on going, not so true.  No car can drive through a building and drive without a flaw.  This car is pretty comfortable.  It is pretty powerful but is made with a not so great engine, looks good on paper but doesn't run as good as anybody wants.  My opinion is that for the money it's a really good car, but if you want a quality car then look for a japenese car make.  <br><br>
