            After nearly getting killed each and every morning by maniac SUV drivers on the way to work, I decided that I needed a bigger car. Something to compete with the &quot;big boys&quot;. But, since I haven't won the lottery yet, I had to consider price. I had to limit myself to about $20,000.

This left me with a few choices:Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage and Honda CR-V

I don't like the looks of the RAV4 at all. There really are too many things that I don't like about it to mention all of them. I think that a well-known car magazine (Car and Driver??) said it best when they described it as &quot;cartoonish&quot;.

The Kia Sportage looks nicer, but hasn't been around long enough. No saftey pattern has been set, and I don't know how reliable it would be. Plus, how would the resale value be later down the road?

This leaves me with the Honda CR-V. It is a foot longer than the RAV4, much heavier, 4 inches more leg room in the back seat, 2 inches more head room. The back door of the RAV4 is one solid piece. This is okay sometimes, but makes hauling anything longer than the space inside the vehicle impossible. The CR-V comes with a much more powerful engine, too. Not to mention, Honda's reliability and resale value.

But the differences between it and the RAV4 aren't what drew me to the CR-V. I like the way that it looks and the way that it rides. The one that I have (the EX model) also comes with all-wheel drive and anti-lock breaks. I couldn't find anything that compared to the CR-V with the same features for anywhere near the same price.

The storage space is great. There are storage bins everywhere. The drawer under the front passenger seat is especially good for keeping CD cases and purses in. The controls are all in really convenient locations, too. Did I mention the picnic table in the back and additional power outlet? All of these extras make the CR-V stand out among others in its class.

My only complaints are that the keyless entry requires you to hit the button twice to unlock all the doors. Also, there is not an auto-lock button on the passenger side, so the door needs to be unlocked manually to get out. Not really that bad, just a minor annoyance.

I would highly recommend a Honda CR-V to anyone in the market for a safe, good-looking, loaded and affordable small SUV. You will not be disappointed.<br><br>
