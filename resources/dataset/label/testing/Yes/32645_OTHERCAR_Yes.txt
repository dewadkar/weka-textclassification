            I purchased a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire about 2 months ago from a used car dealership.  It is a 4 door model, and comes standard with air conditioning, am/fm stereo, and dual airbags.  For a midsized car, it has a lot of leg room, and ample trunk space.  It handles about average, a little on the light side so watch out for hydroplaning and getting blown around by the wind.  One of the only things I dislike about the car is accessibility to components under the hood.  To get to the basics it's fine, but to get to other things it gets much more difficult.  The car is a bit sporty for a four door, I like the lines on the car because it makes it a little unique. The front license plate detracts from the aesthetics.  Also, the Pontiac Sunfire I have heard is better than the Chevy Cavalier because Pontiac adds a few extras.  All in all I have been pretty pleased with the overall performance of the vehicle.  <br><br>
