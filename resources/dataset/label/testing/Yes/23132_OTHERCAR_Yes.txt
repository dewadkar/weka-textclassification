            I had just sold my 1990 Dodge Dakota that has 161,000 miles on it. So, I decided to buy another Dodge and I was looking for economy and a great price, the Stratus was it. I love the looks of the car, decent engine with the 2.4 inline four. It has a smooth ride and really good at the gas pump. The only thing I do not like about the car is the road noise and lack of power. The only problems I have had with this car is the Head Gasket went out at about 33,000 miles, which I found was pretty common. The problem was fixed with a new updated head gasket which hopefully cures the problem. Other than that I have had no other Problems with the car. The brakes do squeak a little when I start the day, but that is pretty common for Chryslers. Overall a great car that I would recommend to anybody with a budget and the idea to save on gas. If I had bought this car all over again, I would have made I had the Mitsubishi 2.5 V6. There has been no head gasket problems with that engine and more power. <br><br>
