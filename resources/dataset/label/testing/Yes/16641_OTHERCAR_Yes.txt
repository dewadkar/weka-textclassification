            I love it, I love it, I love it. I can't rave enough about my Tiburon. Externally a much more attractive design than it's previous model. As a first time buyer I was warned stay away from Hyundais because according to friends and family they had a terrible reputation for poor quality of cars. But as of yet I fail to see their point. For example, I didn't even have my new license plates and I was rear ended by an intoxicated driver. What luck!! Straight off the lot and right into an accident. However, my Tuburon took a licking and kept on ticking. Aside from the expected body damage and minor electrical problems my Tuberon walked away like a champion, no frame damage or anything. The other car, a Toyota which everyone told me I should have bought, was totalled. Smashed like a cheap aluminum can. 
The interior is roomy for the passenger and driver with a sleak futuristic design. Controls are easily accessible and user friendly. Comfortable with a great standard sound system. The exterior design is very sleak and attractive. More importantly it's driving performance is excellent. I needed a car that was gas efficient but strong enough to get me out of messy situations from bad California drivers. So far performance wise it has met and exceeded my expectations. Maintenance is virtually worry free with it awesome warranties. 
Now for the downsides. Externally, the paint job is weak in some areas and prone to scratch easily which can be a heartbreaker for car buffs and first time buyers like myself. The interior is great for the front passenger and driver however, if you have tall friends who need to sit the back, good luck. However, this is to be expected as it's more of a sports car than SUV. During sunny days the radio display in non-visible due to it's color but that's small pickings. Now to it's performance. The Tiburon is both good performance and gas mileage. Remember this car is not a high performance like a BMW or Mercedes so handling corners at high speeds is not it's forte. Sometimes, I do have difficulties shifting to first at a stop but that is easily resolved by shifting to second than first. This problem is new to me as every car I've ever had was a standard.

  Overall the Tuberon is a great buy with it's warranties and affordable price. All around the car is a great surprise for skeptics of the Hyundai world. A good choice for those who want a sporty car and are on a tight budget.
