            After an accident put my wife's '89 Olds Cutlass Supreme in the Junkyard, we decided that we would carshop for &quot;a good, cheap 4-door compact&quot;. After walking through various dealerships at the local (Tucson) Automall we decided on the Hyundai Elantra mainly for the exceptionally good warranties (5 year/ 60,000 mile Bumper to Bumper and 10 year/100,000 mile power train) and the fact that I had spent eighteen months in Korea in '87 and '88 being driven over some of the worst roads I'd seen and through some of the densest traffic I'd ever been in - all this in a Hyundai and without a mechanical incident.
Our new Elantra has the Slate Gray (metallic) outside with the light gray interior. All the standard features like A.C. and power windows, brakes, steering and mirrors plus cruise control, rear spoiler (sporty!!!), mudguards and auto trannie and alarm. The 2000 models feature the new rear child seat anchors and childproof rear door locks - important to young families.
I have fallen in love with this car! It drives like the Mitsubishi Starion I bought in '82 but actually costs less than the Starion did in 1982! In the city the acceleration is satisfying and on the road it drives like a larger, heavier sports car.  Passing is quick and easy, curves are fun and the semi that passes in the opposite direction on two lane roads doesn't produce any shudder or sway. The Michelin 60 series tires make highway miles a pleasure.  All this and 29 miles to the gallon average city and highway so far.  My wife wants her car back!!! She's tired of driving my Chevy pickup.
Who should buy? Why, anyone who wants a bit of pleasure driving, or who has a young family, or who is an old codger like me who still likes to spend some time on winding mountain roads.  <br><br>
