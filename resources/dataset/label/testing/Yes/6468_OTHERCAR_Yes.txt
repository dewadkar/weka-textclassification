            I just bought a 2000 Dodge Caravan.  It's a nice minivan. Here's my experience so far: Our Caravan has low mileage. Only 35k and three years old. Not too bad. The interior is spacious and excellent for children. There are cup holders everywhere and the ones up front are adjustable (no more spilled soda cans).  I do not like how the middle seat's seatbelt is set up.  The problem I'm finding is that I like to put my daughter's car seat in the seat behind the front passenger so that I can easily turn my head and see her. I don't like to put her directly behind me because then I can't see anything while I'm driving.  However, because of the aisle which goes to the far backseat, the seatbelt for the passenger side middle seat has to come all the way over from the roof of the ran.  It has to cross the aisle and then buckle over whoever is sitting in that seat. Therefore, it's not the best for the carseat. It doesn't get as secure as when I buckle her in behind me. That seatbelt doesn't cross an aisle so it's tighter.  Here's the other issue with the seats---anyone who has had an infant knows that the base for the infant car seats fits best with a middle seat lap belt and not an over the shoulder seatbelt.  The only seat which has a middle seat lapbelt and not an over the shoulder belt is the far back seat. So, when my baby which is due next month is born. I will have the four year old in the middle seat (unfortunately behind me where I can't see her) and the baby in the far back seat in her rear facing seat (again, where I can't see her).  I do not like this situation but it's my biggest problem with the van.  The only other real annoyance is the gas mileage is poor but I suppose it's to be expected when driving a V6.  I had previously been driving a tiny Geo.  The cabin noise isn't good either.  It is loud in the van. I haven't quite figured out why but it's always loud in there.  When we picked up the van, the next day we had a flat tire of course.  This is not anything which is unusual but having to replace the brakes on the van three days into owning it was a little bizarre.  The dealership took care of it but I think it was a little soon to need new brakes. Afterall there were only 35K miles.  Then, the suspension started squeaking about a week after we bought the van.  We, again, brought it back to dealer and they said the bushings needed to be lubricated which wasn't a big deal and there have been no problems since.  Hopefully that was it for a while with problems.  Overall, I would say that I'm going to like owning this van.  It does provide the space that I need for my family and it looks good and has great options. This van has power everything (except seats) and none of the features are confusing or hard to use. Cruise control is great. Everything works fine and the van drives excellent. I thought I would have a hard time getting used to driving something so much bigger than my previous car but it really wasn't an issue.  There are more blind spots when driving a minivan but as long as you don't trust your mirrors, you're fine.  The seats are very comfortable and I recently took a long drive with it and was comfortable (even in my very pregnant state) for the entire drive.  I would recommend buying this minivan but be aware of the seating issue if you have a similar family situation. It might be worth looking into a Grand Caravan.  The Grand Caravan has bucket seats for the middle seat. I'm not sure but maybe that would be easier for putting more than one car seat in the van.
