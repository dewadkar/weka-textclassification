            Well, my lease is up after about 50,000 miles put on my 2001 Sebring Convertible, so I wanted to write this review to help those of you looking to buy one used.

The verdict?  Generally above average.

The things I liked: the convertible top (of course), the upscale styling (above average for the price), the available options (I'm a gadget hound), and the peppy engine (still gives me a rush when I climb the on-ramp for the freeway).

Things I didn't like: it's hard to get in and out of the back seat, even for my children.  But hey, who buys a convertible to get in the back seat?  There are only two seatbelts in the back - and I have 3 kids now.  They could have easily added the third one.  But these are minor issues.

The real problem that I had?  The same as any Chrysler, I'm afraid: reliability.

For starters, about 10 months after buying the car, the 6-disk changer jammed and had to be replaced.  It also let out a loud "bang" through the speakers when the last disk ended and it rolled over to the first disk.  The replacement player did not.

About a year and a half in, the drivers side window stopped going down all the way and the motor had to be replaced.

At nearly 2 years in, the battery failed and had to be replaced: the car would not start.

About this same time, the car picked up a loud "hum" from the right rear wheel.  Tires were not the culprit, and this has not been resolved yet.

At 2 1/2 years, the brake light would come on during any sharp turn to the left.  This has never been resolved by the dealership.

About this same time, the I discovered that the tires were wearing very unevenly, even though I rotated them on schedule.  The inside edges of whatever tires ended up on the front were worn away much more quickly.

And now, just as I'm ready to turn it in, it has developed a major problem: a grinding noise from the front wheels whenever driving it &gt; 30 MPH, and the grinding noise becomes louder when turning toward the right at speed.  I think this is probably the wheel bearing, because it is unaffected by the transmission position, throttle or braking.  I just hate the fact that I have to fix this before turning it in on the lease, and of course, it is now out of warranty.

And, to boot, whenever the wiper is on delay, it now gets stuck quite often.  You have to turn off the wiper motor and back on again to unstick it.

I was really struggling with the decision to buy it off the lease or turn it in.  The wheel bearing and the wiper sealed the deal: it's going back.  

This car was GREAT the first 2 years I owned it, but as it aged, it started breaking on me.  I need a reliable car, and as much as I loved driving it on a summer day with the top down, this car is not going to be reliable for me for years to come, and it has to go.

Would I buy another?  Maybe.  The car is fairly high priced for me, though the style and engine can make the cost worthwhile.  I would NOT keep this car longer than the factory warranty period, and would seriously consider planning to keep it only 2 years out of the factory before trading it in.

Hope this review helps - your mileage may vary!  :)
