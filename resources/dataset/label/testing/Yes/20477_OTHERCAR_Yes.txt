<TEXT>
            	I have two Lumina's. 96 and 91, my favorite is the 1991 because I can abuse it (its a tank, the 1996 is a little more dinky; but of course its not made for it), but it terms of power and style the 1996 is better.
	
	The ride is very quiet and easy to handle. The front seats are very comfortable, the back seats are comfortable too, but lack a smidgen of leg room. 
	
	The 1996 Lumina is a very reliable car. I can only remember one problem with the car itself (the other problem was just a flat), and it was with the front left brake, and it wore out brake pads very quickly.
	
	I would recommend this car car for families, say four people max (it can hold six, but of course the middle seats are tight). It has sufficient trunk room, and family safety features, such as child proof door locks. It also has front air bags (both sides).
	
	If you want to just a car for you and your mates to have fun in, its not a good car for you - look at 1991 Lumina for a car to abuse :-).<br><br>
