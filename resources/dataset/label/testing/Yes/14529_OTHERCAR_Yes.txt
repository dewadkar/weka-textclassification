            Wow!!!  I bought my 1991 Honda Accord LX back in 1995.  I bought it used from my brother-in-law for $8,000.  That was close to book value back then, but I still felt like I may have been getting taken.  I had a hard time feeling good about spending that much money for a 4 year old car.  I feel MUCH better now.  I still have this car as my main mode of transportation.  I have 210,000 miles on it and it still runs great (knock on wood).  I have driven this car cross country about 15 times.  For an old four cylinder car, it is fairly quick and fun to drive.  It came with power everything and a CD player.  One of the best features is the little &quot;sport&quot; button on the side of the gear shift.  This button holds the engine to a higher rpm before it shifts.  It actually works and makes a difference.  I use the button on a daily basis.  Negative points of the car include the lack of airbags, no anti-lock brakes, only disc brakes on the front, and half of the seatbelt is automatic.
MAINTENANCE:  I have had the usual maintenance performed over the miles including oil changes, brake pads/shoes, brake adjustments, maybe one or two tune ups, air filters, bulbs, pcv filter, etc.  The few large operations include: replacement of the radiator because of crack in the housing, replacement of the A/C condenser because of a hole (most likely caused by a rock), and replacement of the timing chains TWICE.  It is NECESSARY to change the timing chains approximately every 100,000 miles.  It costs between $300 and $500, but is well worth it.  Currently, I am looking at a leaking main seal.  This could cost some money too, so I am having to weigh out the residual value of the car beyond the cost of the repair.  I will probably repair it and keep the car.
If you are able to find an old lady that is trying to get rid of her 1991 Accord, take a look at it.  If it is low in miles and has a decent interior, the car will most likely be around for a while.<br><br>
