              My husband and I bought the 4 door version of this car as a second car, because of it's good gas mileage.  Being a compact car, it's quite small, and you can forget about riding in the back seat (no leg room) or fitting a carseat (for baby) back there.  This car is no frills.  No power anything, door locks, windows, etc.  But this 5 speed wonder gets incredible gas mileage, we only have to fill it up every 2 weeks, unlike or other gas-guzzler (Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme).
  I would recommend this car as a second car to anyone, but never as a first car, unless it's a teenager :)  It would make a great first car for someone.  Just don't expect it to be comfortable for long road trips.  

  One good thing about this car is that it has a killer air conditioner.  It still runs at peak performance now, 4 years later, I tell you it will freeze you in just a few minutes.  One bad thing is it's small, cramped and you can hear a lot of road noise.  All in all it's a good little car for the price.    <br><br>
