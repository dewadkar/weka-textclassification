            Why did you buy this vehicle?

This puppy has some very leading edge technology and the looks were, well, as unique as it gets.  Some would say it looks like a sneaker, or a pregnant roller skate.  For me, it's sleek and powerful, and stands out from the crowd

Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle.

It's powerful and will go almost anywhere.  I took it 'rock crawling' and it kept up with highly modified 4X4's.  It's zinc alloy 'wrapping' has a sort of bumper car quality that makes it close to indestructable in day to day use (don't worry about a door opening into the VehiCross... it'll just bounce off).  And, of course, it's beautiful.  I have yet to get used to being stared at all the time, however.  This must be a little what it's like to be an extraordinarily attractive women or man.  People always looking at you...  (it does get old).  It's sound simple is excellent with a very tight sound system and easy to use controls.

What I didn't like is the access to the back seat, and the visability could be better when changing lanes (although they did build in a small window that's supposed to make it easier to check the lanes as you change into them).  I did put wide angle mirrors on the side mirrors and it works great.  

What is it like to drive this vehicle?

Driving it is like driving a high performance sports car (high off the ground) disguised as a futuristic SUV.  It's quick and powerful, and it's ride is a little rough (as you would expect from an real 4X4 or sports car.. which is really what this is, a combination between a sports car and an SUV).

Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't?

It's really not a family car.  This is a guy car designed for (mostly) men who have a little more money to spend on toys than most.  If you live alone, or if it's just you and a spouse, this is a great car.  If you have kids, look at a 4 door SUV.<br><br>
