            We lost our 4-door sedan in an accident and had to get a new vehicle to carry 2 adults, 2 toddlers, and a new baby.  

We have a 94 civic we love, and looked to Honda for the minivan.  We had to go used because of cost considerations, and the only one we could afford is from the pre-remodeled Odyssey era.  I believe 98 was the last year Honda made the Odyssey in the frame it was in then.  The 98 model is like an extended and raised regular car model. The back doors open like a sedan door, not like a sliding minivan door.  The new Odysseys do have the sliding doors and remodeled frame.

Nonetheless, this model is fantastic.  No problems at all for 5 year old car.  The middle row seats fit three, and the back seats two.  The back seats easily fold down into the car, to make storage space.  The middle row seats fold up against the driver and passenger seats.  So nothing comes out of the car when converting. 

The ride is great, and there is plenty of room for our needs.  However, I do think there is not enough room once you got everyone seated.  

We are able to fit 3 car seats in the middle row, but often have the baby in the middle row, the twins in the back, and one of the middle seats is always folded up to make access to the back easy.

We have found that you can not go wrong with Honda. The reliability alone is enough for us.  The ride up front for my wife and I is comfortable.  Nice AC.  Radio controls convenient.
