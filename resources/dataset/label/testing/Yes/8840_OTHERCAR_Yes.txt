                 A year ago, we had to have another car. It didn't have to be new, but that was the direction we were headed. We looked at all kinds of cars, with the Honda Accord always there, just tempting us. We didn't think it was possible, but finally we looked into it. 
     What we found, was that for just a little more than we had planned to spend, we could have the car we had always wanted. My parents had bought an Accord in 1987 and it is still a great car. No major mechanical or body work has been needed, and they are still driving it. 
     Hondas have always been reliable and the 2000 Accord is no exception. We have done nothing except regular maintenance in the eleven months that we have had the car. We have gone on three major road trips this last year and were more comfortable than we have ever been. The air conditioning and heating systems keep the interior very comfortable. We have cloth seats, and in the back seat, there is a fold-down arm-rest which serves as a divider so our children each have their own space. Those of you who are parents will appreciate that.
     The Accord can be considered a luxury car at an affordable price. We do have a pretty basic model, but I love driving it. That is a pretty amazing statement for me, since I don't like driving much at all. I guess my opinion for this car can be summed up best by a quote from one of my high school students who saw me getting into my car one day after school. He said, "Is that yours?" I said, "Yes, it is." He then replied, "Cool car!" I don't know if cool is the best term, but if you buy or lease one for yourself, you won't be disappointed at all.  You will be very pleased.
