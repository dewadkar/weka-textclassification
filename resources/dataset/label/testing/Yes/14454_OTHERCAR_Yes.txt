            I have a 1996 Toyota Camry purchased new.  Not my first Toyota.  I've had a Corolla &amp; a Corona, but my car previous to the Camry was a Mitsubishi which I liked, but the Camry is a pure delight.  I only have about 40,000 miles on it, but except for regular visits as needed to the dealer, nothing wrong with the car.  It is a 4-cylinder, but handles beautifully  with plenty of power, and I drive a pretty good grade up and down at least 5-6 times a week.  I love all the features that are special to the Camry, like the doors locking automatically when I turn the key on, and opening automatically when I turn the key off.  The electric windows and seats are so handy too.  

The car is so quiet and hardly hear any wind noises.  It feels good and safe, as it holds the road so nicely.  Gas mileage is terriffic and that really helps too.  The trunk is so large, it will hold lots of luggage plus golf clubs and groceries too!  We put in a cargo net so the groceries don't fly all over the trunk.  I haven't figured out why the manufacturers did not include that with the car.  We do have a keyless entry and I often wonder how I ever got along without that gadget.  

Toyota has us hooked!  Our next car will be...you guessed it...another Toyota!<br><br>
