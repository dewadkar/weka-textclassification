            Digital Still Camera.... 
This has been a terrific camera for me.  Purchased at a pricey $1200 during the holiday season, It has been so easy to use and has allowed me to share  special events with family and friends.  I have been able to forward photo's as e-mail attachments within minutes. It is also a great camera for those of us who &quot;can not find our glasses&quot; but want to get the picture before the opportunity passes. Just look at the large viewer window and press the button.  It takes still, video (up to 30 sec with sound) and allows immediate window scrolling review of your results.
The photos are stored on a normal computer diskette and transfer onto your desktop with ease too! As a part of the package, Sony includes ARCSOFT photo studio software that allows many opportunities to use your creativity and artistic talents prior to printing. Its' 16x zoom function allows close ups and moves quickly.  The battery holds its charge well during the event and I find I only need to recharge it after 2 +- hours of use or over 1000 actual photos.  The super thing is that I can bring along several diskettes and just fill them up, pop in a new one and continue shooting without worrying about getting more film.  The video is fun to use.  It has the pause slow and fast options when replaying so you can pick out your favorite segments for printing.  The audio is sensitive enough to hear the baby breathing when asleep.
