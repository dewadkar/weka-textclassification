               After many years in a compact car it was time to move up. Our biggest problem was finding a car that would accommodate both my 4ft 11inch frame as well as my 6ft hubby. Car after car either had him hitting his head or me not being able to see over the dashboard. Then we drove a Century- the perfect compromise!  The adjustable driver's side seat is a joy and the dual passenger temperature zones have solved many a quarrel on trips. 
   One thing I wish we had sprung for was the adjustable passenger side- when I'm not driving I feel like I'm sitting in a hole.  The reclining seats are very comfortable for long trips and the engine is so quiet sometimes it seems like it's not even on. 
   The main annoyance is the automatic locking doors- when dropping off passengers you have to remember to unlock their side. This is a fixable problem though and the Buick Web site is very helpful and quick to answer. It's been 9 months and no mechanical problems at all- truly a dependable car that's affordable.<br><br>
