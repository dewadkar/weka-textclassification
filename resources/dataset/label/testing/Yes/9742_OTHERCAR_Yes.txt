            With this 2.11 MP camera, you will have convenience and ease of use.  How many cameras out there provide you with a built-in One-Touch Upload button to transfer your images to the computer or the Internet?  Not too many.  This Nikon Coolpix 2500 is that easy.  Connect the camera to your computer with a USB cable, then press the Transfer botton.  In a matter of seconds, the photos get moved to the desktop.  It's one thing to take digital pictures.  Manipulating them and storing them are another thing.  The NikonView 5 software takes care of that.  Getting your pictures to the computer so you can work them is just a breeze with this little camera.  This is why I see it as a good fit for somebody who is buying his/her first digital camera.  It will also do well in the hands of a mature person (think about grandpa and grandma who don't care much about sophistication for now).  This Nikon Coolpix 2500 camera will get the job done with no fuss.  It will give its owner an idea of achievement and performance.  After all, all digital cameras should have been this easy!

Who can beat the price for all the features in this camera?  If you bargain well, you will get this decent little camera for under $200.  This is the story of a friend of mine who is pregnant and due any time now.  A few weeks earlier, while on lunch break, we stopped by our local electronic store to shop.  She did not want to spend a lot of money.  She was fortunate to find a good deal on this unit.  I did not hesitate a bit to encourage her to purchase.  I had already used it on many occasions.  The most recent time was at a local agriculture fair.  A few friends of mine had a little photographic shop named Digital Pix T-shirts.  When the two main cameras were busy, we also took loads of pictures with this Nikon which were later printed on t-shirts and prepared as buttons.  Families as well as boyfriends and girlfriends sat at this little bench in this makeshift studio.  I will admit that the quality of the pictures was just alright.  

<b>If you are thinking about purchasing it, consider the following features among many others:</b>

This Nikon Coolpix's inner-swivel 3x optical zoom Nikkor lens has a zoom range of 37-111mm (35mm equivalent)which allows you to get close to the action.  Now, there have been some red eye issues.  This camera comes equipped with a built-in speedlight with a red eye reduction pre-flash feature.  It also has an enhanced LCD screen that spots Nikon's BriteView technology.  That's not all, folks.  The Nikon Coolpix 2500 digital Camera is also loaded with the Nikon's 256-segment Matrix Metering and digital image-processing algorithm.  It's equipped for fully automatic picture taking, continuous shooting modes for fast action sequencing and 12 scene modes to take your shots.  Here is a list of scenes you can select:  party, portrait, night portrait, sunset, landscape, night landscape, close-up, backlight, fireworks show, museum, copy beach and snow.  

<b>What do I like with this camera besides its easy uploading?</b>

I enjoyed viewing the pictures that I take on one-quarter fo the LCD monitor through the camera's Quick Review function.  Live action viewing is also made possible.  Once I take the picture, I can save the image ina reduced-size with the Small Picture function If I want to e-mail them.  Saving and Storing your images are made easy with the convenience of the included NikonView 5 CD-Rom.  In the package, you will also find the Coolpix 2500's suite of software from ArcSoft with PhotoImpression 2000 and VideoImpression 2000, ArcSoft Panorama Maker allowing you to place together pictures to create panoramic images.  

The Coolpix 2500 comes with a lithium-Ion battery, a charger and Nikon Coolpix Starter Memory CompactFlash Card.  There is also a holding strap.  


<b>Final Recommendations</b>

This is a decent little camera for any digital enthusiasts.  If you don't want to be intimidated by all the digital talk, trust this digital camera.  Its ease of use will endear it to your heart.
