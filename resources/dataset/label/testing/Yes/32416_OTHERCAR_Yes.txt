            The Honda Civic is a great car to drive for someone more interested in the  &quot;miles per gallon&quot; figure that a car can deliver.  In my area, gas recently has been in the $1.30-$1.40 range per gallon range since the first of the year.  Though the price seems to be coming down, who knows when OPEC will get the urge to raise it back up?  My 1999 Honda Civic CX has delivered between 34 and 38 mpg since I bought it in October, 1999.  I bought the car to atone for an earlier mistake in purchasing a car for my teenage son.

In February of 1999, I kept a promise to my son and bought him a 1966 Ford Mustang.  I thought it would prove to be reliable transportation and would be inexpensive to operate.  Well, I was wrong!  The engine and transmission had been rebuilt and the car looked good, so I thought I was set.  Well, all we did during the nine months we owned the car was make repairs to the engine and transmission!  Since my son is heading for college in the fall and I all ready have a daughter in college, I felt I needed to get my transportation problems solved once and for all. I gave my son my 1996 Chevrolet S-10 and decided I would get me a high mpg car to drive back and forth to work.  I work for a phosphate mining company located 40 miles from where I live, so I thought I should go the high mpg route.                                                                                                                                              After doing my homework, I narrowed my choices down to the Honda Civic, Mazda Protege, and the Chevrolet Metro.  From a price standpoint, the Metro was the least expensive of the three.  However, it also had the worst ride and felt like I was riding in a tin box.  A lot of the guys at work own one, so the Metro must not be too bad of a car.  It just wasn't the car for me.  I had test drove all the cars and decided that either the  Mazda or Honda would be fine for me.  I decided which ever car I could get the best deal on would be the car for me.  Looking back on it, I probably should have bought the Protege.  I could have gotten the Protege for a check for $10,000 and trading in the mustang.  As I wasn't sure that I liked the Protege's stereo system, I decided to get the Civic without a stereo system in it.  I figured I would take my stereo out of the S-10 and put it in the Civic and buy a new CD player for my son.  I wrote a check for $9600 and traded in the mustang for the civic without a stereo.  Alas, bad luck was with me.  The cassette player quit working in December so I had to buy a new stereo anyway!  I also had to put a cruise control on the car.  So for the $400 difference, I would have probably been better off with the Protege.  Oh well, you live and you learn!

When I researched what I wanted in a car, I decided I needed air conditioning, cruise control, and some sort of a stereo system.  The car needed to get better that 30 mpg.  I would like to have as much power as my S-10 with the Vortec V6 had, but realized early on that this was not possible.  My Honda Civic came equipped with the 1.6 litre SOHC 4-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission.  It has a 4-wheel double wishbone suspension system, ventilated front disc brakes (which indicates the rear are probably the drum type), and rack and pinion steering.  Safety features are air bags for both the driver and the passenger 3-point seat belts (both front and back), and side impact door beams.  Interior features are front reclining bucket seats, rear window defroster with timer (who needs a timer?), side window defoggers, tinted glass, intermittent windshield wipers, remote fuel filler door release, adjustable steering column, maintenance reminder (probably a reminder to spend money for something you don't really need), driver's foot rest, 50/50 split fold down rear seatback, trip odometer, and vanity mirrors on both the driver and passenger side.  Air conditioning was installed by the  dealer and cruise control was installed by my neighbor.  I installed the stereo system with a Kenwood system purchased from Crutchfield.

The car rides and handles beautifully!  I owned a 1991 Mazda Miata (since taken over by my daughter), so I know what good handling is.  My Civic handles just as good as the Miata on the winding country roads I drive.  In a parking lot though, it turns like a truck.  My Civic does not have power steering, but I wish I had it.  When I first got the car, I thought &quot;did anyone ever build a slower car or what?&quot;  This thing was slow!  I remembered on the test drive that the salesman had me take it up to 60 mph in third gear.  I didn't know why at the time.  Later at a basketball game I was talking to a mechanic friend (who I probably made wealthy while I owned the mustang) about how slow the car was.  He told me that I owned a high RPM car and needed to learn how to drive it.  I took him to heart.  Instead of downshifting from 5th gear into 4th when passing, I started going from 5th into 3rd.  Boy, did that make a difference!  Mind you, I still didn't have the pickup of my S-10, but I did become a lot happier with the car.  I had read a review where someone didn't like the way an earlier edition of the Civic performed on the freeway.  Well, Honda must have read that review.  On a 4 hour trip, my Civic did 80 mph and acted like she wanted to do more!  I really think the car performed better at the higher speed.  It really becomes easy to drive.  I expected to feel more vibrations and hear more wind noise.  Instead, the car seemed to have hit the sweet spot for riding comfort as it was very smooth.  The wind noise was almost nil and not at all what I expected.                                                                                                If I drive the car like a little ole lady from Pasadena (translation-slow and like I got some sense), I am able to get a consistent 38 mpg driving mostly in the country.  If I drive like a bat out of you know where, I'll get 34 mpg and that ain't bad.  While not having a lot of power, I can still spin tires on takeoff to impress my son (he's easily impressionable) and at the same time pull up to the gas pump and know that I'm only going to have to pay for nine or ten gallons of gas to ride a week on.  I'd recommend the car to anyone who wants reliability and driving economy over power.  The Honda Civic doesn't cost much to buy as far as cars go. It is one of the least expensive cars on the market. Also, Honda has proven itself to be one of the most reliable cars made in the world. My Civic has only been in the shop for an oil change, so I think she will prove out to be reliable.  Would I recommend the car?  Most definitely yes!
