            For starters forget the price tag it has no relevancy what so ever in this article.  This vehicle provides jaw-dropping performance while maintaining a luxury atmosphere.  The new Porsche Boxster S has to be one of the most breath taking cars I've ever driven (beating my 98' BMW 740il, 98' BMW 323i, and 94' Porsche 911 carrera 2).  The refined boxster s provides &quot;tire smoking&quot; power from it's six cylinder engine.  With a top speed of over 165 miles per hour (governor off) this car can take almost anything on our american highways.  With such safety features as front, side, and head impact air bags you can feel safe in this hardtop.  Optional features include 18 inch wheels, Global Positioning System, heated seats, and a roll bar.  

If your looking for a vehicle that can provide you with power, refinement, and luxury than this is the vehicle for you: the 2001 Porsche Boxster S.
