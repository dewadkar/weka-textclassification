            I've always been a loyal customer of Ford when it came to buying cars, and last year when I moved home from New York City to North Carolina the first thing I had to do was get myself another car.

Of course, I went to my local Ford dealership and was absolutely charmed by the little Ford Focus ZX3 hatchback.  That car was the one I decided to purchase, and I've never regretted it.

<b>Size</b>
When you look at the ZX3, the first thing that would come to anyone's mind is how extremely tiny it looks.  Compared to just about every car on the road it looks like a miniscule little machine because the ZX3 was first introduced in Europe where small cars like that are more common.  But when you look at the inside of the car you would be very surprised at how roomy it really is.  It may take a taller person a while to crawl into the back seat since it is a two door, but once you're back there the leg room is more than ample.  A friend of mine who is six foot five has never had a complaint about sitting in the back seat.  

<B>Aesthetics</b>
What can I say?  This car just looks plain cool.  Its European design makes it stand out on any street (or parking lot) and when I'm driving I always notice people looking over at my car.  I've even had complete strangers come up to me in parking lots asking me about my car.  The inside is also very nice looking because the console is very rounded and streamlined and looks like a space ship (at least that's what my nine year old cousin says).  

<b>Comfort</b>
I could drive from North Carolina to California in this car and the seats would still be comfortable.  The drivers seats seems to have a bit of lower back support and on days when I've worked to hard or slept at a weird angle just getting in my car and driving makes my back feel better.  

<B>Driving</b>
I had a Mustang before I had this car, and in many ways my Focus is more fun to drive than that car.  When I drove it off of the lot after buying it, just a mere tap on the accelerator made me take off a little faster than I should have.  This car is PEPPY!  

Driving the ZX3 on the interstate is always something that I look forward to because you can go from zero to sixty or seventy in just a few seconds (without flooring it).  

Its small size also makes it turn very well and even the sharpest curve or turn is always done with virtually no difficulty.  

Also, parking used to be a problem for me because I've always had long cars - but with this one even the scary thought of parallel parking isn't a problem.  The ZX3 is a LOT shorter than any parallel space that I've ever seen and that's just one less thing I have to worry about when I'm driving (go ahead and laugh...harhar).

You also have to remember that this is an economy car so the engine isn't all that quiet, but there's nothing distracting about it.  If you have your radio on at an average volume you don't even notice that slight amount of noise the engine makes.

The only thing that you may have to look out for is the very small rear window.  At first, backing up was a bit of a challenge because the rear window of the ZX3 is significantly smaller than any car that I have ever had, but once you get used to it you don't even notice how small it is.  

<B>Gas Mileage</b>
With the ever rising price of gas, mileage is always an issue when you buy any car.  This one has FANTASTIC gas mileage.  I have a forty mile round trip to and from work every week and I do a lot of going and coming besides work too.  A tank of gas consistently lasts me seven days or more.

<b>Other Features</b>
Air conditioner - The A/C gets really cool fairly fast (the same with the heat), but the vents are in sort of odd places.  There's one that is almost right behind the steering wheel so your hands get cold or hot before the rest of you does.

Stereo - The Focus comes with a very nice radio/CD player that will allow you to program up to twelve stations and has nice speakers but it's nothing that would impress a car audio enthusiast.  But if you're anything like me and don't need pumping bass and ear shattering music it's more than enough.

Trunk - If you look in the back window it doesn't even look like you have a trunk because when it's closed a small cover comes down and conceals it.  But when you open the hatchback trunk there is more than enough space.  The trunk is also nice and tall, so it won't crush your shopping bags (go ahead, make fun of me again).

Compartments - There are little compartments to put things like CDs and change all over the place.  There's a large compartment that doubles as an arm rest and several scattered around the console.

Locks and Windows - I was a cheap skate when I got my ZX3, because I got it without power locks or windows.  I've never found that to be an inconvenience because the locks are very easy to reach and push button easy.  The windows are your typical "turn-crank" and I'm only 5'2" and I've never had to struggle to reach over and roll down or roll up the passenger side window.  

<B>Problems</b>
Problems?  What problems?  I haven't had any.  Ford obviously believes in their products because the ZX3 came with a very ample 36 months/36,000 mile warranty.  I paid a few extra dollars per month to have that extended to ten years/ 100,000 miles and I've yet to have to use it.  The car has done NOTHING but run flawlessly.  Maybe Ford learned their lesson after the problems they had with the Ford Explorer.

<b>Ford Service</b>
Ford gives outstanding customer service.  They definitely want you to be happy because I'm always getting performance surveys in the mail, little bottles of touch up paint, and even a really nifty coffee mug with the Focus logo on it.  As I've said, they believe in their product and that's why I'm a repeat customer.

<B>Overall</b>
While this car is a tad too small to be a family car, I'd definitely recommend it to couples with no children, teenagers, college students, and even retired people (I know an 85 year old woman who has one and she loves hers more than I love mine).  It's very affordable, and you get a lot of car in a tiny package when you give this one a try.  

If you are in the market for a new car and you want something little and peppy, take a look at the Ford Focus ZX3.
