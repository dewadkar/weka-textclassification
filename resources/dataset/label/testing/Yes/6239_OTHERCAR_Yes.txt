            I will guarantee you that when my husband bought his 1984 Nissan pickup truck it was not called the frontier...... But he has really put this poor old truck through it's paces.  It just won't quit.  He drives this truck to work 72 miles a day.  The he hauls about everything imaginable in it.  He has carried crushed stone for the driveway, a 150 gallons of water for the farm.  You would not believe the torture. It isn't pretty to look at anymore, but it still just keeps on plugging.  
We all pick on him about getting a new truck but he is loyal to this old thing, and as long as it keeps taking him where he needs to go ... he will not part with it.  
I hate driving it because the seats are very worn uncomfortable, but he informs me that they work for him.  I guess this old Nissan King cab truck just won't die.  <br><br>
