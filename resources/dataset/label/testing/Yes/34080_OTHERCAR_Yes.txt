            The 3040 represents a new advance in digital cameras, complete with super fast f 1.8 lens, tremendous range of practical user controls and, most importantly, fabulous pictures.  Just finished two beautiful 5X7 portrait enlargements of the kids for framing that meets or beats the quality of my old Nikon 35 mm system.  Photo quality being, after all, job one, the Olympus shines in that department, especially when using the higher quality photo setting (in Olympus parlance--SHQ mode).  

Quirks abound, nonetheless. For seriously 35mm photogs, as I was in the digital dark ages, perhaps the single biggest adjustment on the 3040 and other digital cameras is the lag between pressing the shutter release and picture being taken.  The 1-2 seconds delay (which can seem considerably longer) can interrupt the timing of shots but, with some practice, one learns to adapt and make do.  A quirk more unique to Olympus--the popping out of the lens upon turning the camera on accompanied by the popping OFF of the lens cap, should you forget to remove it yourself, is associated with a rather alarming but apparently harmless grinding sound.  Solution? tether that cap to the camera with a cord that Olympus has (finally) provided (it was not on the original c-3030) and remember to simply pop it off each time you turn the camera on--problem solved. 

More troublesome was the woefully inadequate download instructions in the otherwise fairly decent manual (which thankfully includes an index).  Olympus actually has pretty good download instructions on their website (which they'll also send you if you email them) but I wasted many hours struggling to download before uncovering the elusive instructions online.  Why they failed to include these instruction in the manual is a mystery that only Olympus can (and should) explain.  And forget about getting a live person on the phone--I tried multiple times for several hours without success.  Once mastered, however, downloading via USB is a snap and works like a charm.  The Camedia software is very rudimentary but easy-to-use and functional.

On to the good stuff--the fabulous creative options.  My favorites: 35mm motor drive style setting, a tremendous advantage with digital enabling rapid shooting (a dozen shots in seconds, though not with flash....) in which you can quickly discard the bad shots and keep the good ones--great for shooting kids during those precious action moments; black and white or sepia (very cool if you're into that), five levels of picture quality (memory eating SHQ is superb, can get 20 SHQ shots on 32mb card), control of flash power, aperture/shutter speed/manual settings, ISO (film speed equivalent) settings, auto/manual/spot focus choices, and a great touch for photographers interested in such details--you can see key information (F stop, shutter speed, ISO) on the monitor screen accompanying each picture for a few seconds, should you choose to.  

More good stuff: the fast f1.8 lens allows for more available light shots without flash and greater ability to throw the background out of focus for softer, more appealing portraits. Batteries?  Picked up four NiMH with charger for about  $25 at Radio Shack--still going strong after two days of extensive use.  The camera body feels right, at least in my hands--good weight, balance, and is just small enough to stick in a pants pocket should you choose to. 

Best of all: picture quality, including incredible enlargements.  The c-3040 in SHQ mode can produce 8X10 portraits of quality sharpness and color, totally suitable for framing and displaying.  If you're looking for high quality photos, fast lens, user-friendly body and are willing to live with a few minor quirks, you'd be hard-pressed to beat the c-3040 at this price point.
