            I bought my 1991 Caprice Classic in 1994, as a replacement for my 1987 Plymouth Reliant which was getting a bit long in the tooth.
The odometer reading on this 3 year old car was 62000 and it looked just great. It is silver metallic and power everything. I got it for $ 7600 (about $ 11500 Canadian). I could not believe the soft and quiet ride, excellent acceleration, incredible Bose sound system and decent mileage of 21.5 Mpg over the last 143000 miles. Many auto magazines at the time wrote negative opinions about this car. They thought it was ugly, suspension too soft and not very reliable. I think it looks great, is extremely comfortable, especially on long croos country trips. It is so roomy that six people can share the ride having to be very close friends! 

My experience so far (yes! I still own this land yacht!) has been very good. The only expenses other than routine maintenance have been: 1) rebuilding the transmission by a friend at 75000 miles (US$ 590) 2) new rear axles at 180000 miles (US$ 650) and a new CD radio at 165000 miles (the old one died and was to expensive to replace with the factory original)  3) replacing the remote door opener (US$ 60). 4) new shock absorbers for US$ 63 (for all four) at Sears (with lifetime warranty).

Other than those expenses absolutely nothing has broken or required repairs. The engine is still going strong at now 205000 miles, requiring only about � of a quart of (synthetic) Mobil 1 every 3000 miles.

This car has been used to commute to and from work for the last 6 � years, 80 miles daily without the slightest complaint. It always starts, is quite good on snow with studded snow tires and dirt cheap to repair.

I�ve been dreaming about a new car for quite a while but since this one doesn�t break down, is paid for and requires cheap insurance I have not been able to justify buying a new one!

Besides, what car do you know that makes cops smile and wave you through at traffic checks and makes your fellow drivers suddenly slow down and behave well? And in case of an accident it�s  nice to have some extra protection! (Not that I need it, I haven�t had an accident in 27 years of driving).

Would I recommend anyone buying this car? YES! I�m even looking for another Caprice similar to this one but with lower mileage to replace it, sometime!
