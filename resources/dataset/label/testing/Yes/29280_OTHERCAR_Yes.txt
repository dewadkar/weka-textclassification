            Hello,Eveyone would like to start by saying that if you don't know there is a long time Chevy versus Ford battle.These is pretty much mostly between the Ford Mustang and the Chevy Camaro.As you might have already noticed I am a chevy fan.the New Camaro is better than ever,it have many options and has,a lot of pony for the dollor.&quot;You can get them with convertable,hard tap,or even t-tops.the best part is the motor options you can get. Many people like lots of horse power others like to drive a sports car thats good on gas with power when needed.This Camaro comes with a v-8 or v-6 option.There is a V-6 that is able to push 200hp easy,with the gas millage of a normal family car.That is a great power gas millage combo.They also have the killer combo thats sure to whip them 5.0 mustangs.(As a Camaro owner i can tell you race a 5.0 mustang, when you beat it its a great feeling)The what I call killer Camaoro combo is a 5.7 liter LT-1.This motor with little money put into in can easy run 12's in a quarter mile. That is what makes this a mmustang killer.I have seen them in action,I have drove one,there great! It's the next best thing to a Vette,but with more seats for your friends to enjoy the eperiance the fun.If you don't belive me go to your lacal track there is sure to be one there taking out the mustangs!


                                    your friend,
                                            GOD    <br><br>
