            We had a Nissan Sentra before we had kids.  It was a great car.  Our Sentra was so totally used.  It had 200,000 miles on it.  When I went to register the car in my name the DMV did not believe me when I put down the mileage, they made me take them out to my car and show them the odometer.  Whenever there was anything wrong with the car, it was easily (and cheaply) fixed.  It was a great looking car, with a few dents.  I loved this car so much but when we had kids we really needed a bigger car.  The one drawback to our Nissan was that the inside was SO tiny.  But for people without kids, that is not a big deal.  We finally had to trade our Sentra in, and with over 200,000 miles we got a fair price.  I  still see that Sentra making its way around my town, and I fondly remember the good old days when it was mine.  <br><br>
