            If you are looking for a solid, dependable truck for recreational use, this might be the one. 

I own the XL model, which is the basic truck -- no roof rack, step or fancy little compartment up by the dome lights. It came with AC and an in-dash radio with CD player. It does have four doors, V-6 engine and an automatic transmission.

I traded in a '99 Ford Explorer Sport on the Nissan, and haven't regretted a thing. The minor inconvenience of losing the covered storage space is more than made up for in the flexibility of having a true truck bed. And the bed extender makes it even better. Compared to the Ford, the interior plastic looks a little cheaper, but the seats are more comfortable and the interior looks better constructed. The rear passenger door has a little bit of weather stripping sticking out that needs to be taken care of, and the temp gauge wasn't working when we first picked it up. Since then, it has been great.

The V-6 engine feels more powerful in the Nissan than the one in the Sport ever did. I don't think there is as much road noise, either. The Nissan came with B.F. Goodrich tires, a nice relief after the big Firestone recall. Even though there is more power, the truck rarely fishtails. The Explorer seemed to skid every time it rained. The gas mileage isn't great -- it's somewhere in the teens.

Give it a try and see what you think.
