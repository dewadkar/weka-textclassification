                   Hi everyone who reads my opinion, I am a Geo Prizm owner. I've been one for 6 years now and I must admit I really like the car. There are it's good &amp; bad things about the car, But first let me tell about all the good things about my car. I've had this car only 4 years my parents sold it to me after they have had it for 2 years. I paid $8,000.00 For it. I most say for a 2 year old car that's a steel. I remember buying it for all the reasons why I still like it today. The car has been in 2 front major accidents and it was fixed like new and to this day it still runs like new. I have to admit the car is great on gas. I go about a week with out filling it up. I pay about $13.00 to fill it up. I get about 315 High way miles to the tank &amp; I get 285 regular traffic miles to the tank. The car is great in all weather conditions. I don't mind the seats, there semi comfortable. Their are no steering problems. The car has great heating &amp; air conditioning. One thing I recommending is Get power everything.

Now lets talk about the Bad things about my car. Lets start off with the back seats, one their is no leg room what so ever. If you have more than 2 people in the back there are going to start complaining. Another thing wrong with this car is that it has no acceleration. I mean it takes forever to get the car moving. Oh I recommend Get power everything before for this reason, if you have roll down windows after a while you are going to need a set of strong arms just to roll them up &amp; down. So get power everything. 

Other than that I have no problems with the car. I also have gone over 100,000 miles and the car runs Great. Plus I just use the car for going to work, But I drive a B M W for going out places. So if you are looking for a good car just to get around in. 
GET A GEO PRIZM ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br><br>
