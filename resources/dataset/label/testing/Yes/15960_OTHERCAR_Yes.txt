            A year and a half ago I changed over from a BMW 528i to a Mercedes Benz E320 Avantgarde. So far it has proved to be a decent changeover. The real downsides are to do with the value for money. In Australia this car lists at $135,000, plus another $3000 for metallic paint and $4000 for the sunroof. The rather heavy bill does not include climate control air conditioning -however; with my past experience with German cars climate control is a complete gimmick. This is a considerable premium over equivalent six and eight cylinder executive class cars from other motoring marques, which, comprehensively, come with more standard goodies. Hopefully this car will live up to its projected resale value, which would offset the hefty price premium over its rivals.

Interior room is excellent, though the rear seats are a bit too slippery for the occupants during swerving maneuvers and/or spirited driving. I wish the interior presentation matched the interior room. I find that the Birds Eye maple wood grain and black leather combination is a bit oppressive, and the dashboard layout is nothing short of austere. This aspect of the car is way behind its Lexus and BMW competition. Even up market Fords feel more luxurious inside than this car.
The sound system is breathtaking, I haven't ever sampled a factory system that sounds as good as this one. The closest in clarity and loudness would be the ones found in the Audi cars, which incidentally also use Bose speakers.

Now, the interesting part!
Straight-line performance is quite adequate for my use. It does not provide the neck-snapping acceleration that can be achieved by other cars costing much less. Nevertheless 0-100km/h in roughly 8 seconds isn't a slouch for a lardy, luxury car. Overtaking on the wrong side of the road is taken care of with a decent prod of the accelerator, no dramas there. Well... not too many anyway. The accelerator pedal is very stiff and needs to be pushed all the way to the floor to make for decent performance, aside from this it is entirely civilised. There seems to be a peak in torque at around 3000-3500 rpm's where the car feels very responsive, more than equal to some V8's that I have driven, namely the VT Commodore SS and BMW 535i. 
At high speeds, upwards of 160km/h the car feels rock solid and you start to appreciate the slight vagueness in the steering just off centre, this stops your steering inputs from being too aggressive -by accident-, and preventing you from overcorrecting. Upwards of 220km/h and the car was whispering quiet -the volume on the (excellent) stereo did not need to be put up-, and very, very stable. 
I am a reasonably enthusiastic driver and enjoy a good punt along a windy country road. Here I found the BMW 528i to be extraordinarily well balanced and wanting nothing in grip or go. The Mercedes is every bit as good, and then some. The Avantgarde models are equipped with lowered suspension over the elegance models (it doesn't mention on the parts list whether it is stiffer, but it certainly feels it). Through mountain roads is where you are paid back for having a harsher ride than the 5 series. The car has no initial understeer or oversteer, it feels completely neutral to the BMW's slight tendency to push the nose wide (bearing in mind that we are comparing a sporty variant -Avantgarde-, to a standard variant that is not equipped with BMW's M-tech suspension. If you start to push this car beyond the limits of the tyres limits of adhesion there is a mild tendency for the car to push the nose wide. This can be remedied in slow corners with a prod of the right pedal, the oversteer induced is controllable and progressive. The automatic transmission is a very impressive piece of equipment; it changes gears on kickdown and the upchange smoother and quicker than any auto tranny I have yet sampled. The dogleg gate is also handy, and, in my opinion nicer to use than the gimmicky sequential automatic gearshifts. Another bonus is that it never slips into the next gear when you don't want it to. If you have it in 3rd bouncing off the redline it'll stay in third till u pull up or stick the lever into 4th. This is an asset compared to the steptronic system in the BMW which decides to change up just before the redline which can make a fine mess of the apex you are speeding towards.

This car would be suitable for families containing well-heeled individuals that appreciate sparkling performance at the very slight expense of ride comfort. If spirited driving isn't your preference then you should stick to the Elegance variants of the E-class. 
All in all the E320 Avantgarde Mercedes Benz is an impressive piece of motoring equipment. This car managed to convert me from being a die-hard BMW fan, something I never thought would happen.
