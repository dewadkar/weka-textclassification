            The Toyota Camry had the quietest ride of all cars we test drove. The ride is also very smooth even on rough roads.  We had previously had a Ford Taurus but the engine overheated.  We had experienced wind noise when the Taurus was new which was never really corrected by the dealer so we were looking for a car which was quiet and reliable. I have owned Chevrolets, Fords, and now this Camry and the Camry is by far the best car we have ever had.  

I have the VIN number on the windows which is a good idea.  We like the mirror with built in compass but miss the reading lights in the Taurus.  The Camry has plenty of seating room in front and back. The controls are conveniently located.  The drivers seat adjusts well to tall(me) and short(wife) people.  

Even the best cars have a few disadvantages.  I wish the drivers power seat back would adjust to a more vertical position.  My remote entry key  does not open the trunk.  It quit and had to be reprogrammed but other than that this car is fantastic.  <br><br>
