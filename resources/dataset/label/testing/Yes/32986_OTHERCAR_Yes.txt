            The Toyota Camry LE V6 has been a peach of a car, for the last three years and now 75,000 miles later, still looks new, runs great, maintenance free, its very quiet, sometimes I don't realize that I started the TOY already! 

The Toy handles and hugs the road, and surprises me when I realize the speed that I am driving with the V6.  The Cruise control works great, easy to set, and release. We just completed an 11 day trip across country and it was a joy to drive and ride.

We also have the comfy leather interior and the sun roof, a great combo especially for the trip.<br><br>
