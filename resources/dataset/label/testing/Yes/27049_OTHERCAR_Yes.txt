            Recently my husband dragged me to the local electronic store to look at digital cameras.  I have to be honest and say I was not thrilled about this. I thought why do we need a digital camera? I have a brand new 35 mm.
that I love and I have a scanner that I can scan the pictures with to put on the computer.  But after talking to a sales man who really knew his stuff on the digital camera, which really helped me see the reasons that it was a step up from the regular camera. The first selling point was the money you can save in the way of film and developing prices.  He then went on to show us the ease of taking a picture with the large screen. and the clarity of the photos.  We purchased the Olympus d-450 ZOOM. There were other cameras a little less in price, but for the extra money we chose this one .  It offers 3X optical zoom, a large memory to hold more pictures. And most important easy instructions for a computer novice (such as myself) to actually down load the pictures onto your computer.
I have to say, that for someone who was so skeptical of this product, I now recommend it to all my friends and relatives. The only con I see is I still would like to have film for it. (old habits die hard.)<br><br>
