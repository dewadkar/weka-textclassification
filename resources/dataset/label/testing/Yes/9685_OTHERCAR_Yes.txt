            When I bought my new Eclipse in 1994, I knew that it was virtually identical with the Plymouth Laser. Somehow, I couldn't bring myself to buying a Plymouth, but a Mitsubishi - now that was sexy.  I fought off the &quot;buy American&quot; urge, and got the Eclipse.

The car performed wonderfully.  I lived in a rural area with plenty of winding, un - patrolled roads.  I never got the courage to go into a corner so fast that it didn't stick like glue.  It was a joy to drive.  

The only trouble that I ever had with it was at 55,000 miles - 5000 miles out of warranty-  or maybe it was 65,000 miles.  I forget what the warranty period was.  At any rate, the timing belt, which was past the recommended time for replacement, broke.

The dealer came with a tow truck, took me and the car to the dealership, and dropped me off at work.  (This happened during my lunch hour)  Two hours later, he called and told me the car was fixed.  The dealer had someone drive to pick me up.  I got the car, and was told there was no charge,even though the warranty had expired.  I happily drove back to work, but the engine was not right.  I called, and they came out to get the car.  At 6:00, I went back to pick it up.  There were three mechanics working on it.  They apologised for not being done.  They continued working on it until 7:30 - an hour and a half past closing time.

Somehow, I don't think that I would have gotten that kind of service on a Plymouth Laser.  

I am confident that Chrysler corp and American car manufacturers in general have improved both their products and their customer service a lot since 1994 - but I'm not sure it is yet up to the standard I experienced.

On the bad side - the rear seat space is a joke - but I knew that when I bought it.<br><br>
