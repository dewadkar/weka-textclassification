            In my opinion the chevy s-10 is the best pickup on the road.  My dad bought an s-10 10 years ago, and he has loved it to death.  Once i got my license it was passed down to me.  I love it, it's easy to drive, it's a stick shift, so i was able to learn how to drive a stick.  It's not very fast, only a 4-cylinder, but since it's a stick it seems like it's going fast.  I've been putting a lot of time and money, especially money into fixing it up so it looks as good as possible for a 10 year old pickup.  It�s been a very reliable vehicle, and I�d take it over many other vehicles on the road.<br><br>
