            We have only had the van for about 5 days. I may right another review after I have put some miles on it. As for first impressions however, it is wonderful. 

We bought the 2003 Town & Country LXi with leather seats. The price was 35,000, however this includes tax, title, license, doc fees, and extended warranty. Furthermore, we got this van at 0% interest so while you can get a cheaper van in the end you will pay the same or more for much less van. Wait until you can get the 0% on this van if possible. It takes some of the bite out of the price. 

The temperature controls and on-wheel stereo controls are two of my favorite options...along with the 6 CD changer and 10 speaker Infinity system. We are considering getting the DVD system later, but the price tag is hefty and the 6 disk changer is very nice. I rarely have to reach for the controls on the radio because the on-wheel controls do almost everything. The three-zone temperature controls really work! My wife is typically cold and I am hot. Now we both put our zones where we want them and forget it. Absolutely great! 

Now on to the power doors! Our van is equipped with three power doors (left and right sliding and rear). I cannot say enough about this. If you have kids and you can get even one power door it is the way to go. As I said, we have had the van for only five days and these doors have made a noticeable difference in our commuting experience with 2 boys (soon to be three). Even without the kids, trips to the grocery store are easier--but that is just an added bonus. 

My wife would be mad if I didn't mention the heated seats. We chose the leather seats for ease of cleaning over cloth, but they can get COLD! The heated driver and passenger seats erase this problem in a hurry. If you get the leather seats be sure you also get the heated ones! 

The ride is smooth and quite and the van is just plain easy and fun to drive. 

A few caveats. First when disengaging the cruise control with the brake (verses the button), I have to really push the break or the it just guns it back up to its previous speed. Second the rear floor mat does not fit properly. Finally, the power outlet in the center console that is meant to be used for your cell phone is pathetically positioned. I can not even get my hand to it, my wife has to do it and she can barely do it. That outlet is connected directly to the battery so you can't leave it plugged in without pulling from the battery when the vehicle is off. Again we have only had the van for five days or so and I intend to speak to the dealer about these issues. They may just need attention on my vehicle.
