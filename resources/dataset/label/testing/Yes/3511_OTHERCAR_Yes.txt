            I was given the responsibility at my job of finding a digital camera for the church where I work.  They wanted an easy to use, compact, digital camera.  They told me to get the best camera for my allotted $300.00 budget.

They all know that I write here on epinions and they also know that I use epinions to research everything I buy that is what I consider to be a major purchase.  So my first stop on the way to finding this camera was right here at epinions.  I searched for digital cameras to find the ones who were rated the best.  After doing research here I read Consumer Reports to see what their recommendation was for a digital camera.  Funny thing epinions members and Consumer Reports came up with about the same list.  After arming myself with all kinds of information off I went on my search for a digital camera for my employer.

<b>My Choice</b>

I looked a quite a few different cameras made by different companies, Hewlett Packard, Olympus, and Polaroid to name a few.  I weighed the options of each one and found that the <b>Hewlett Packard Photosmart 315</b> was the camera of choice for the church where I work.

<b>Why The Hewlett Packard?</b>

Price was one of the major factors for my purchase.  This camera had many more features than all the others and was on sale for a better price.

Megapixels was another reason for my choice, this camera offers 2.1 megapixels.  I have a Polaroid Digital Camera at home and the picture quality just cannot compare to the Hewlett Packard.

The Hewlett Packard name didn't hurt either, as we have many HP products at work.  We have never had any problems with service, customer support or even replacing a defective product.  I wanted the members of the church to have the piece of mind that help was always just a phone call away to Hewlett Packard's customer support.

<b>What the HP Photosmart 315 offers you</b>

1.  Sensor - 2.1 megapixels
2.  Color Depth - 30-bit
3.  Resolution - 2.1 megapixels
4.  Memory card - Compact Flash Type I - 8 mg. card is  
    supplied with camera.
5.  Zoom - 1.5x, 2x, 2.5x digital zoom
6.  Auto Exposure
7.  Auto Focus
8.  Self Timer - 10 second delay
9.  Built in Flash
10. 1.8 inch LCD color with 4x playback magnification
11. USB port interface

All of these things together made this camera a great deal for the price I had to pay.  The resolution of the pictures is incredible.  We have taken pictures with this camera inside an almost dark church, pictures of stained glass windows with sun coming through and also pictures of the members.  We had no problems with any of the preceding pictures other than the occasional problem of the photographer not knowing how to work the camera.  The camera itself worked wonderfully.

This HP Camera with its LCD display lets you see the picture you just took and decide whether or not you need or want to retake the picture right there.  No need to hook it to the computer and download the photographs you can decide right there on the spot.

Since this camera would be carried on many of the trips the youth groups, children and adults make the weight of the camera was a concern when considering purchasing this camera.  Upon inspection it was found to be quite light only weighing 8 ozs. without the batteries and even with 4 AA batteries installed the camera was still quite light.

<b>What This Camera Can Do For You</b>

This HP camera will be able to give even a novice photographer like myself some wonderful picture memories to share through email, on web pages or to print out and share with your friends.  You don't need to be digital camera literate to operate this camera.  Five minutes after opening it and reading the instructions for set-up you will be on your way to great pictures.

Super-Fine which is 1200x1600 resolution and produces the highest quality of pictures made by this camera.  Use this setting for taking pictures you want to print larger than 8 x 10 inches.

<b>What is Included With The Camera?</b>.

With your purchase of the <b>Hewlett Packard Photosmart 315</b> you get the camera, 4 AA batteries, and the HP Photosmart 315 CD for downloading, cropping and sending your pictures to family and friends.  The software is very easy to load and oh so easy to operate.  It is a step by step process using this software and even has an email button there for you to send pictures without having to save them to file and then go to your email and send them.

<b>Final Thought</b>

This camera is perfect for anyone who is a novice at photography and is wanting a place to start and grown with digital photography.  With it being easy to operate, as it does everything but take the picture for you, you can't miss by purchasing this camera.
