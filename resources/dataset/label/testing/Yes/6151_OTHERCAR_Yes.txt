            I have a wonderful midnight blue 2000 Chevrolet Impala. I took several months deciding which new vehicle I wanted to purchase. I finally asked my daughter to help with this major decision. I had been to at least six dealers and drove approximately 12 different cars. 

My daughter brought home the Impala and I test drove it. I couldn't find any reason for it not to be my next car. It is very reasonably priced. It has a somewhat sporty look to it. It has lots of room for our whole family including being able to have 2 passengers in the front with the driver. 

There are several things that I love about the Impala. I really like the individual heat/air controls. I love the comfortable and roomy seating. There is a very trunk space. However, I do wish that I had power seats. I find it difficult for me to adjust my seat and usually need to do this matter prior to getting into the car.

Driving the Impala is great. It has a very smooth and quiet ride. I do need to watch my speedometer carefully though.
