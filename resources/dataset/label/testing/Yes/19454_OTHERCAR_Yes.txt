            I drive a 1996 Toyota 4-Runner LTD.  The SUV really doesn't belong to me, but rather my father.  He felt so strongly that this was a good and safe vehicle for me to have, that he sent it to college with me.  

It has proved to be a life saver when trying to get home in a snow storm. The area that I live in is noted big snow storms that drop lots of snow very fast, and this vehicle never fails.  

Besides the normal tune-ups, it has never needed to be fixed or taken to the shop.  I had my first accident in this vehicle.  I bumped another car and dented the side panel of the other car.  I was worried sick about what damage had been done to the truck, because I did not own it at that point. When I looked, I couldn't tell which side had bumped the car because there was absolutely no damage.  

I drive this vehicle up steep and winding mountain roads without any handling problems what so ever.  I can park this truck in spaces that many others can't.  On or off road, it's a blast to drive.  

This truck has everything you would ever want in a vehicle. From the 3 disc CD player, to the leather interior, to the sun roof, to the roomy back seat, to the amazing power and four wheel drive capability, this SUV has it all!  

The best thing I like about this vehicle is that I know it's going to keep my family and I safe while getting us places that no other car can.  That's not something you can say about most vehicles.

The worst thing about this vehicle is the cost.  It's definitely not an inexpensive vehicle.  Gas mileage, as with most SUVs, is not the best. 

If you are looking for a vehicle that is safe, reliable, and fun to drive you found a winner.<br><br>
