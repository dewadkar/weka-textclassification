            I was very impressed with DSC-P71's performance.It takes about four seconds from turning on the power until you capture the first image. The shot to shot time is less than two seconds even at the largest image size and highest quality. To use the flash it takes about 3 or 4 seconds.The time it takes to write to the camera is of no issue as it is less than three seconds, you don't need to wait for it to finish before taking the next image as it streams the data to the card.
The P71 has is able to record still images as well as movie clips without sound and features a number of exposure options even though it is basically an automated 'point -N- shoot' camera.
The camera comes with standard AA size batteries to power the P71.I definitely would get an extra set of batteries and the biggest memory card available. It is much more fun to shoot a bunch and later pick the best to print than it is to worry about batteries and available storage.
Transferring the pictures from the camera via UBS cable (provided) is very easy. Microsoft will run you right through it.
I think the DSC-P71 is a good choice for anyone that wants a camera that can be easily carried in their pocket or purse and wants quality images. The 3x optical zoom, F2.8 bright lens and 3.2 megapixel are great features. I feel the Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 would be a great camera for everyone, but definitely would purchase a larger Memory Stick and a second set of batteries. I got the 128MB stick for an extra $89, and a camera case with extra batteries and fast charger an extra $50.
