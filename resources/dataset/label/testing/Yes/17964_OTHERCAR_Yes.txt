            I'm a teacher in upstate NY, and have to drive through horrible conditions frequently throughout the winter.  When I moved here, I was driving a Saturn, which I loved, but which lacked a certain something when driving through deep snow and over icy roads.

I've always wanted to get a Jeep Wrangler, and the opportunity presented itself last fall.  The day I picked the car up it was snowing and I had to attend a class...when the class let out there was a whiteout and 8 inches on the road since the plows had come through.  The Jeep got me home faultlessly.  

Since then, I've enjoyed the traction, power, high clearance, roominess (I'm over six feet and on the far side of 250 pounds), and fun I've had in driving the Jeep.  Another little known fact outside of the Wrangler driving world is that we wave to each other...it's true, I was surprised the first couple of times it happened, and thought that the people waving must be mistaking me for someone else.  Since then, wherever I go, other Wrangler drivers wave to me, and  wave back and smile...it's almost as if we're sharing a secret that the rest of the driving world is missing...we are!

It's a great car!<br><br>
