               I purchased a 1991 dynasty at an auction....Yes I took the chance! Why not when I could a car with 89,000 miles on it and a few personality dings! I also could pay cash $1600.00 when it booked for more than double what I paid for it!

   I like to buy Dodge or Chrysler vehicles like this because they keep on going. I drive over 55,000 miles per year, mostly highway at high speed. 

   I love this car because it has power steering,cruise control, tilt steering wheel and air conditioning as well. It has a 3.0 liter V6 engine and cost me less than $2000.000. In the 18 months and 85,000 miles later I have put a very minimum amount of money into it. One set of brakes and the normal worn out tires! In other words normal maintenance items. 

    Some people have claimed that they experienced transmission problems with this model, mine was rebuilt at 77,000 miles before me! It does shift hard at times and sometimes will try to slip when going into that last overdrive gear, however I have ignored it and continued to great mileage and service for about 50,000 miles so far.

    The car handles well at both high speed and low. It has comfortable room in the rear for passengers. Probably its greatest fault is that it likes to cruise over the speed limit very easily! If it didn't have cruise I would be donating money to the the local police on a regular basis!

    I think anyone with a limited pocket book should consider purchasing this car! Its longevity and low maintenance costs have made it pleasure to own and drive. While others are still paying interest and high car payments I get where I want to go in comfort! Oh yeah did I mention it gets good mileage about 26 miles to the gallon?<br><br>
