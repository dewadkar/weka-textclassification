            We now own a Mercury Villager.  It is a 1997 model we purchased new.  I Love It.  The ride is very smooth, its handle's very easily, we get decent gas mileage, the van responds just like a car, and it is packed with many of the nicc features you find in luxury automobiles.  The power steering and anti-lock brakes are great in rainy conditions.  The sound system, although not the premium edition, is excellent.  The comfort of the seats and the moveable driver's seat is unbeatable.  The car has adequate space for families and luggage, and when equipped with a roof rack can easily handle our large family of 7.  I find the Mercury Villager a true and enjoyable driving experience.<br><br>
