            The Oldsmobile Intrigue is definitely a best bet when it comes to comfort, agility, and style.  I bought the Intrigue 8 months ago and immediately fell in love with it's peppy v-6 motor and it's traction control.  For a mid-size sedan, this car will keep right up with the small sports cars on any day!  I could not believe how spacious and comfortable the Intrigue is!  You never have the cramped feeling you sometimes get with smaller sports cars, but you still have the sporty look and speed!  To drive this vehicle is awesome, it is suitable for any age person!  It's peppy enough for a young person, and roomy enough for a family ( and it won't make you feel old !)  I definitely recommend the Intrigue to any car buyer! The car is great! Go For it!  You won't be disappointed!<br><br>
