            I drove a Wrangler for three years during college, and I loved it.  I especially loved being able to take the top off of the Jeep on sunny days. Then my lease ran out and I realized that I've grown up a little!  (everyone keeps telling me I'm an adult now, no no no!).  So after a lot of thinking, I made the hard decision to turn my beloved Wrangler in and sign a lease for a Cherokee.  I've had it for a little over 2 months, and love it.

The Cherokee I picked out is a Patriot Blue (it's a slightly pearlized dark blue) 4 door Sport.  It rides like a dream, of course this is coming from someone who drove a soft top Wrangler, where the top would shake hard enough where you couldn't hear the radio if going faster than 50 mph.  But seriously, it does ride very nicely.  There's also a lot more room than the Wrangler.  Five people can ride comfortably in it, and there's cargo area in the back plus a cargo rack on top.

Just a couple weeks after getting the Cherokee my fiance and I took it on a road trip from Northern VA to South Florida.  We drove about 9-10 hours at a time, and were comfortable for the most part (you'd get uncomfortable in even the most luxurious car after 9 hours!).  

Even though the Cherokee is bigger than the Wrangler, it's still as easy to maneuver, although I have yet to try and parallel park it.  Another big difference between the Wrangler and the Cherokee is how fast you drive.  In the Wrangler once you hit 50 or 60 the top would rattle so much you couldn't hear the radio.  Going from that to the quiet almost road noise-less Cherokee was a huge difference.  There are times when I look at the speedometor and am really surprised at how fast I'm going (oops!)

I still miss my Wrangler, but I'm falling in love with my Cherokee.<br><br>
