            I have been using Canon's prosumer Powershot "G" series cameras since G1. A few days ago, I just sold off my G2 when I found out that G3 has arrived at the local stores.

I have nothing against the G2, in fact, I think it is a great camera. If you read my review on the G2, you'll see what I mean.

I upgraded because my philosophy is always use the most current model of digicam if possible. That way I always get to enjoy the latest technologies.

At first glance, the G3 doesn't seem to be too great of an improvement over its predecessor. The most obvious "upgrade" is the 4X zoom lens. Other new features don't seem to be that big a deal. However, I would like to offer my very own subjective opinion as to how the G3 is better than the G2.

First of all the body design has improved quite a bit. The G3 has a much more substantial hand grip which is kind of like rubberised (not sure exactly what material is used, but it sure has a better grip compared to that on the G2). On the G2, the grip is smooth plastic which doesn't make any sense to me.

Secondly, I love the ability to move the focus point almost anywhere within the frame (compared to G2's 3 fixed points). The focus is also fast and accurate most of the time.

Thirdly, the built in neutral density filter is cool! It enables me to capture images in bright light situations with large aperture or slow shutter speed - all without any external filters!

Fourthly, although G2's battery life is rock solid, G3's is even longer! At the rate I'm going, I may be able to take photos for 2 weeks without recharging!

Fifthly, the time lapse function is new and could prove to be fun to use.

Sixthly, the camera automatically rotates the photos taken vertically to display properly in replay mode. This is especially useful when viewing the images through the TV.

Seventhly, all the operations (startup, autofocus, shutter lag etc) seem faster than the G2.

Lastly, I think is is thoughtful of the design team to have the remote receiver located at the side of the camera (as well as in front) as this gives greater flexibility in placing the camera.

What I don't like about the G3:

1. The mode dial is too loose. Many times it turned upon putting the camera into the bag and taking it out. I never had this problem with the G2.

2. The menu selection for jpeg compression level is not at all intuitive. I had to refer to the User Manual to find out how to set it.

3. The focusing is awful indoors and at the higher end of the zoom. Eventhough not at the maximum zoom position, the camera is unable to focus. Again, never had any similar problem with the G2.
