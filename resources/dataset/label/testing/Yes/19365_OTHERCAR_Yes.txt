            To be honest, I bought my Geo Metro because it was cheap. I assumed it would last a few years, and eventually would just stop moving and I'd cast it off for another cheap means of transportation.  I bought it new in 1992 as a leftover, and until it finally died in 1999 after very heavy usage by both myself and my husband it was utterly dependable.

No one can complain about this car's gas mileage, if it's kept in even fair condition. At 45-50 miles per gallon on the highway when new, it is the car that gas companies have to hate. With a standard transmission, the mileage is even better. The only reason I ever had to fill the tank more than once/week (unless I was traveling for the weekend) was because that tank was small.  Admittedly, I usually had a very short commute to work.

I am not a slow driver. And the Metro didn't have the biggest engine. It takes a while to get up to a decent cruising velocity, but once it's there it stays there pretty well. Unless you're going up a mountain. Then its poor little three cylinders are doing their best. It does shake at higher speeds, but it's a particularly light car so that isn't surprising.

When it comes to collisions, I've never been in a serious one with this car.  But the few minor ones have demonstrated that while it's not the safest, it is designed well enough to not be a death-trap. And has mostly only required cosmetic repairs to be running fine.

My Geo survived several cross-country trips between New York, Texas and Florida.  Several of those trips involved being heavily-laden. Aside from a flat tire (which was my own fault) it never gave me any trouble.  I will note that some of the buttons don't tend to stay on, and I've seen few Metros on the road a while that still have all their buttons attached.  But then, it's a cheap car.  Don't let the cosmetic cheapness fool you though, this is a car that can handle itself.

One of its best features wasn't advertise (that I saw, at any rate). You can PACK this vehicle. We actually moved couch sections in that thing.  Until you see for yourself, you can't imagine how much that little car can swallow up with the back seats down. And really, that makes it more stable on the road since it's usually too light.

Finally, one good note about the light car, and this time coupled with it being front-whel drive.  I had no trouble getting my Metro moving in the snow. Sure it slides a bit, but it just rode atop the snow, rather than getting sunk into it. All I did was dig a little, then rock the car back and forth until it rolled over the drift. It was a great source of amusement to me to watch people with much fancier and more expensive vehicles trying desperately (and without much success) to get their car moving.  Now don't get me wrong, I've been stuck in new-fallen snow. Once it's settled, though, the Metro is great.

At long last, my Metro suffered a fluid leak somewhere in the engine that was going to cost too much to find and fix.  By then, my husband had been driving it for months on his 3 hour round-trip work commute.  It certainly paid for itself, and more.  I wouldn't advise it if you need something really solid or if you have small children. But if you just need something to drive, the Geo Metro is a very pleasant surprise.
