            This is not your usual SUV! The most luxurious I have seen. I test drove the Lexus RX 300, the Ford Explorer, Chevy Blazer, and none compared to the Bravada. It was comfortable, with so many amenities, and wow, what a ride! It was smooth, and one was able to see the rode so well. I drove a Subaru Outback before this, and you cannot compare. In the Bravada, you are much higher up on the road, and it was a disappointment getting back into the outback after test driving the Oldsmobile Bravada. It had lots of cargo space, and was very luxurious. This car is for everyone. It is what someone can describe as a &quot;Mommy Car,&quot; or a &quot;Shopper's Car.&quot; 
Overall great car! I highly recommend it.<br><br>
