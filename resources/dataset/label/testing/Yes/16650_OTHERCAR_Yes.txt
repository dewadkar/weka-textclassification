            <b>Why a new car?</b>
Five months ago I was driving along in my SUV, a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo, when I took a turn too fast and almost rolled the thing.  It wasn't the first time, but with my 2 year old strapped in the back seat, it really shook me up.  Knowing my driving habits weren't going to change, I realized my car would have to.  After doing a lot of research, I decided on a Chrysler Sebring Convertible.  I found a used one and was about to buy it when my eyes focused on a Hyundai ad... a fully loaded new 2001 Tiburon for $11,495.  A Hyundai, hmmm, that part I wasn't sure about.  I jumped online and quickly pulled up a few reports, hopped into my truck and raced to the dealership.  I flashed the ad at the salesman and he laughed at me, saying the car was long gone.  I took the ad car to car and finally struck paydirt, the sticker stated the car was $17,995.  The salesman gaped, but brought me the keys for the test drive.  A few hours later and with 1 grumpy 2 year old, I drove my new car home.

<b>What's this car got?</b>
The standard package included: air conditioning; cruise control; power locks, windows, and mirrors; rear spoiler; 15" tires; and AM/FM stereo with cassette.  Additionally, my car included 4 wheel ABS, a power sunroof, cargo net, deluxe carpeting, carpeted floor mats, and pin stripes.

<b>The Good</b>
The Tiburon is sporty, but is in the coupe class.  This means that while you've got the sports car look, you don't have the sports car price or insurance costs.

The car handles beautifully and performs exceptionally in turns and high speed situations.  I'm not going to roll this car by taking a turn too fast.

The gears in this car are well spaced and generally easy to find.  I occasionally have trouble finding reverse.

The Tiburon comes complete with a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty and a 5 year/50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.

The buttons and dials are large, easy to read, and intuitively laid out.

<b>The Mediocre</b>
I've found that when the temperature hits below freezing, the stick shift will occasionally get stuck and won't easily go back into first gear.  Since we didn't have many of those days this year, it didn't pose a problem for me.  

The trunk of the Tiburon takes much more force to close than would be expected.  I tend to only properly close it on the first try about 40% of the time.

While the Tiburon is a coupe, it has the trunk space of a sports car.  You can forget hauling anything large in this little car.  However, I pulled the passenger seat the entire way back and managed to fit a 21" monitor in it's box into it.

The back seat is tiny.  I have a car seat and a booster seat back there.  Nothing else will fit.  This is a 4 person car.

Finally, the Tiburon performed horribly the one day the roads were icy.
