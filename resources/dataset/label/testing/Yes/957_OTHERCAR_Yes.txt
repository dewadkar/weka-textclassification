The Corvette is an unbelievable car. It is incredilbly fast, but I was also impressed at its level of refinement. I've had the car now for 9 months and love it every bit as the first day that I drove it. The neat features are the run flat tires, the active handling and new for 1999, the &quot;Heads Up Display.&quot;  The &quot;HUD&quot; is great in that you  never have to take your eyes off the road. The only drawback from this is that on sunny days the reflection from the heads up molding is noticeable in the windshield.
The absense of a spare tire really adds to the cargo room, but Chevy could've done a much better job with the storage covers in the hatch. They are cheap and almost never fasten correctly. In addition the car could benefit from a power closing hatch, as you shouldn't slam the existing one and dropping it down, then closing it is a pain. All in all though these quirks are just minor setbacks in one amazing machine.
