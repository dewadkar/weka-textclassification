            We just bought a 1999 GMC SLE Z-71 yesterday and it is a great truck. It has the extended cab with the 3rd door which is great for rear entry.
This truck came with the 5.3 327 engine and will really get up and go.
For the price this truck is great it has all the extras that you need plus some.
I've always been an avid Chevy person and swore off GMC even though they are closely related, However I've been very Impressed with this truck and the looks of it are great.
So far the gas mileage has been good, I'm also a owner of a 1994 Chevy silverado with a 350 so I'm familiar with gas hogs It's just been a part of my life, This truck rates better in that area so far,
The back seat area has plenty of room for the kids and this truck also has the airbag that you can turn on and off which is great if you have children sitting in the front.
So far we have nothing but good to say about this truck, the best thing I can suggest is go get one today and Ride on.<br><br>
