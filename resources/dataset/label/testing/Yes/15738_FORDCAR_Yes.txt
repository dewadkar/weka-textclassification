            I bought my windstar accidently, when I had to make a 1600 mile trip in a hurry.  I have never been much of a minivan admirer, but I have to tell you all, that I had the most enjoyable,comfortable,economical trip that I have ever experienced.  Since I bought my van about 6 months ago I have put 20,000 miles on my Windstar with no problems!  Last winter when a deer ran out in front of me my ABS brakes, stopped just in front of the deer. I do not know  who was more surprised me or the deer. When spring came and my road became a virtual mud hole, the Windstar got me and my children back and forth to school.  Even when the school bus would not come down our road.   I can not say enough about this reliable vehicle, just if you are thinking in buying a minivan or any kind of van I suggest you take a good look at the Ford Windstar.<br><br>
