            Ok, first you walk over to it, the Prelude is heaven for your eyes, looks nice with good curves without the 2000 Celica spaceship look. Next you open the door and take a seat in the car (well I admit climbing in is sort of like climbing through a jungle gym, you might hear your feet hit this and that on your way in, but all the better once your in, this way you get the 'glove' style fit). The first thing you notice after your in the driver seat is the dash, the dash is very open allowing both you and your passenger to see everything it has to offer. Next you close the door and notice how the entire interior wraps around your body. The panels on the door are curved with the heater ducts on the door instead of the front dash. This provides for a quality feel and the glove like fit. When you insert the key the dash lights up and the engine roars to a start then clams to a low purr. You can hear the exhaust, which has a nice sports car sound, much better than most stock exhausts. When you start to drive one of these machines you'll fall in love right away and the car will just keep growing on you, every feature will be adored.

Exterior Rating: 9
Better than most new cars, has the perfect amount of curves but also has some boxyness to it creating a perfect style.
Only annoyance: Backing up is a pain, can't see anything and the little space under the rear spoiler just isn't enough (how often do you backup anyway). This is compensated however with a very unusually perfect view through the front windshield.

Interior Rating: 10
Once you drive around a bit you'll fall in love with the dashboard style. I don't ever want to go back. This car has a very open feel. Very open dash that is not at all cluttered but perfectly spaced. Nice simple and effective digital clock.
This is one of Honda's better cars when it comes to interior. I've sat in many Civics and Accords as well as Del Sols. (When I was looking for a car to buy). Civics have very cheap feeling interiors, light doors, plastic feel. Accords are better but still aren't what they should be. Del Sols are very cheap feeling, at least the ones I sat in. The center counsel are not done correctly. (at least for a sports car, but unlike what people think, accords, civics, and del sol's are just not sports cars) (Accord is a Sedan, Civic is a Compact and the DelSol is a roadster).
Drawback: The back seats are not seats, they'd be good for younger kids (not teens). But for anyone else they are just cramped. They are useable if you must have seats. On the other hand the front seats take a real sports car feel, they don't have the adjustable head-rests like most car. The entire seat is one piece. Sit in one of these cars and you'll see what I mean, you could fall asleep in this car and you'd like it better than your bed. I've ridden in other cars and had my hips cramp, but in my Prelude I can ride around for hours and love it more and more every minute, you'll never get sick of it. I always take my car out just to drive it around and it's fun sitting in those seats. (Friends will love riding around in this car!)
It can get loud inside but that's only when your revving, this car has the perfect sound and it's a true sports coupe coming from it's price range.

Engine: 9
Honda did a good job with this one. Good HP and good Torque. The Torque is 140-150 which is very uncommon for Honda's, Civics Accords and the others are all 112 or so (weak). This gives the Prelude an even more luxury feel but still has the sports car speed with the high HP (VTec's even more so).

Performance: Perfect Handling. I would have to say that next to the S2000 and the NSX this is Honda Motor's best handling car. This car can take more than you want to dish out. I can easily burn anyone on a back road race. This car can easily handle 100+ MPH on back roads (most cars can't do that nicely on highways...). I've even found that when the tires do start to slip then the high back end style causes the rear wheels to slip first which causes the back end to swing (with good control though) which allows this car to make even sharper corners. I've never lost a back road race in this car! I have raced a Camero Z-28 at 100+ MPH (passing car after car) and I have to say that I didn't see the Camero often at all (after the initial acceleration). I could keep the 100+ MPH through the curves but the Camero had to slow and accelerate (he must have burnt quite a bit of gas doing that and he must have killed his brakes).
Only Disadvantage: A bit on the heavy side causing slower acceleration that I'd like but then again, I can still practically beat a 3000GT VR4 (he beat me on his second try by a car length).
By the way, one big extra with this car that shows what it can really handle. I've driven this car over some big drops at 100+ and I have never had it lift off (jump). Many of my friends have jumped going 70 over the same stuff I can go 100 over. You can feel the tires drop when you race over a drop then the car just slowly dampens back down until it's sitting low again.

Ride: 8
I'd have to hand the Prelude a sports car ride. It can be rough when driven slow. The back roads around here are 30 MPH (everyone drives 40) so it rides a big rough then. The advantage is that if you take the same roads at 60+ then the suspension sits down and rides perfectly making the car feel like it's flowing perfectly down the road. I'd rather have good sport suspension rather than some soft plush ride.

RELIABILITY: 10
Backed by Honda's reputation.

Value: 10+
Perfect price, way better than other Hondas in more than one way. Faster than the pre-2000 Celicas (probably puts up a good competition with the 2000 Celica). Great styling, perfect handling, I'd have to say this is a perfect value too...

Prelude Vs. Integra
Sorry in my mind the Integra loses. The VTec prelude has more power than the Type-R Integera. The handling in the Prelude is soo far superior. Prelude's tires are wider. The Prelude has more torque too. The Integra interior feels cheap in comparison. The exterior of the Integra just can't compare. I'd have to say the Prelude is in a different level all together. Only Advantage on the Integra is off the line (GSR would take an Si, not sure how the VTec's compare).

THE VERDICT: 10+
This car is one that I'll never want to give up. I really almost want to preserve one and restore it any time it needs it. It's a really great car and I think Honda is going to have a real tough time making a better car (I think they feel flat on their face with the 5th Gen. Prelude)

If you don't own it, take it for a 30 minute test drive, you'll probably buy it after that or never stop thinking about it.<br><br>
