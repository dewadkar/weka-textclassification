            The Chevrolet Tahoe LT is not only powerful and roomy, but it is also great looking, comfortable and the features are enough to satisfy the pickiest family.

First of all, I must point out that I purchased the LT model of the Chevrolet Tahoe with four-wheel drive.  

The 5.3L engine is enough power for pulling a nice sized boat or a trailer with snowmobiles without a problem.  There is a tow/haul switch which helps the shifting of the transmission for heaving loads.  The gas mileage ranges from 16 mpg to 19 mpg which is pretty good as I live in a very hilly area. 

Since the area I live in also has a moderate amount of snowfall each year, the automatic four-wheel drive on the Tahoe is a nice convenience.  The four-wheel drive is extremely reliable and the driver can also switch it manually instead of using the automatic feature. The driver cannot tell when it is engaged except for the exceptional traction. 

The roominess and comfort in the Tahoe is really amazing.  The three rows of seats provides ample room for 6 people during long trips.  My 6'0" 14 year old fits perfectly with no complaints.  

The driver and front seat passenger have a full-blown lumbar system.  Heated front seats are another convenience in the Tahoe that is hard to do without.  The heated seats are quick and also have settings of high and low.  The electronic climate control keeps the temperature constant in the Tahoe.  The rear passengers also have their own electronic climate control.  There is a flip down table for drinks and snacks in the center of the second section.  There are power ports in all three sections of the vehicle which comes in handy for Game Boys on long trips.  The second seat audio system, which includes two outlets for headphones, provides the back seat passengers with their own control over the cd player, cassette player or radio.  There is also a compass and temperature gauge in the rearview mirror.

A lot of complaints in the past regarding Tahoes were about the split doors and how there was no windshield wiper on the back.  This has changed on the newer models.  Even though the split doors are still available, you can also equip one with a liftgate which has a windshield wiper.

The Onstar System is also a valuable service to have for a family.  With a purchase of a new Tahoe, the Onstar Security package comes free for a year.  This security feature, by using a GPS, will automatically locate your vehicle if you are unconscious and your airbags deploy.  The system will also unlock your doors for you if you lock your keys inside of the vehicle.  After my year expires, I do plan on reinstating this package.  There is also a concierge package available with the Onstar system which will make hotel reservations, give directions as well as buy tickets for you when requested. 
 
If more cargo room is needed, the third row of seats has the ability to be taken out and there is also a nice luggage rack.  

Reliability is an understatement with the Tahoe.  I have encountered no problems with the engine as well as the electrical system on the vehicle.  I did, however, have a problem with a squeaking panel on the passenger side, but that was fixed at no charge.

A family needs a reliable and spacious vehicle as well as conveniences in the vehicle that will help make a trip easier.  The Tahoe has all of the above and more. While the price of the vehicle may not be in every family's budget, the Tahoe is well worth the price.
