            <b>Pros</b>
Good image quality, overall colour balance, good sharpness 
High resolution (1800 x 1200) 
Fairly quick operation (fast startup, average cycle times) 
Flash output controllable 
Well thought-out on-screen menus 
Simple to use 
Good construction, well put-together high quality feel 
Probably the best looking fixed-focal-length digicam 
Small size makes it very portable 
Camera remembers settings after power-off 
Lithium battery and easy charging 
Automatic lens cover 

<b>Cons</b>
Up-close image quality concerns: zipper effect, flat area noise and thermal noise at slower shutter speeds 
Auto white balance can easily be fooled, white balance needs to be selected for best results 
Sometimes requires "double focus" (two half-presses of the shutter release to get a good focus) 
Small size and vertical orientation can make camera difficult to hold steady for long exposures 
Setup menu could have done with allowing a little more flexibility over settings 
Some ergonomical problems (fingers over flash / thumb knocking command wheel) for those with large hands 
Less features than competition 
Different aspect ratios in support resolutions (1800 x 1200, 1280 x 1024, 640 x 480) - not a real "con" but slightly "odd" 

<b>Overall conclusion</b>
The MX-2700 is Fuji's answer to the easily pocketable easy-to-use 2 megapixel class camera and to that extent it fits the bill, most people wouldn't notice or be bothered by the occasional image artifact (although poor performance in low light was a let down). A worthy successor to the popular MX-700.
