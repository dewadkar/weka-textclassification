              On my baby daughter's recent trip home from college, I had a chance to check out the little sportscar we had purchased with her in the summer of 2000. Mrs. Strategery and I have had a deal with all of our children that we would help them with their first car. All the others had let us off easy, eagerly grabbing something inexpensive as soon as they could. Not my Penny, she patiently saved her part of the down payment for nearly two years while having her older siblings serve as taxi drivers. Smart - just like her old man.

  Anyway, Penny and my wife came driving up one June day in a really bright little <b> Honda Prelude </b>. They were on a test drive from a car dealer that we had dealt with for years. I could see they had both fallen in love with this little car. I thought it had too much power and was too flashy. It was two against one; do I have to tell you who prevailed in that family conference. We ended up purchasing that car for a little over $22,000.

  Not withstanding my initial reservations,I have to say that little sports car has been a gem. I enjoy taking it in for scheduled maintenance (or sometimes overdue maintenance). The <b> Prelude </b> is a 4 cylinder but it has much more power than my <b> Pontiac Grand Am </b>. It has 200 horses under the hood which makes it fun to drive. The ride is a tad bumpy but nothing major. It can be a noisey ride especially if you want to listen to the radio or compact disc player.

  The interior is quite compact. The compactness is not a problem for my petite daughter. For her big and tall Dad, the friendly confines are decidedly cramped. I need to adjust the seat as far down and back as it will go. Even with these adjustments, I wouldn't want to take It on a long trip. I have no complains with the display console. Every gage and light is large enough and easy to read. The back seat is even more cramped than the front. I can not imagine myself getting back there.

   I think the <b> Honda Prelude </b> is quite a stylish model. It even has a rear spoiler. I don't know if this actually does anything, but it helps convey a sporty image. The red exterior paint job has held up well. The only ding that I know about on the entire car is a very small little crumpling that occured in a fender bender at a Wal-Mart.

   Penny's 1999 <b> Prelude </b> gets fair gas mileage, about 25 MPG. I've got her beat in that department. In the almost one year that we've had the car, It has performed very reliably. You can tell it is well built by how solid it feel when opening and closing the doors. We have only had to perform routine maintenance. All in all, I would have to say Penny and her mother picked out a pretty good little car. It is one that should last and provide years of good service.
