            The E-class is anything but a small wonder, they are beautiful, large, luxurious automobiles.  Even without all the options, as mine is, it's still a pure joy to drive.  The E-class makes almost no noise, has the classic benz suspension and has the power to get you down that highway near you in an awful hurry.  The major advantage lies in controlling the vehicle.  As with most perfomance automobiles, it begs to be driven at high speeds.  Unlike it's more purebred cousins of that ilk, you can tame it well enough to drive with your family in the car.  Your wife might smack you now and then but the kids will never cower in the back.  
    Not only is the car as safe any Benz, it's more decently priced than a lot of the more luxurious models.  Once you get rid of that baby seat in the back and go off on your own, you'll love the car even more.  To put it in more automotive terms...it hauls @$%.  So go out and test drive one of these beautiful benz's today
