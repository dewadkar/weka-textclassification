            My husband purchased this product primarily for his business use.  He builds network systems and trying to describe verbally how the system is physically set up and displayed is next to impossible.  This enables him to take a picture in a small, cramped, usually hidden office and convey the work to his cohorts at the corporate office.  I used it this Christmas season for the first time.  I found it to be very user friendly with the menus displayed onscreen and maneuvered the settings quite easily.  I set it on a tripod to take a family portrait thinking I would save myself some money, time and overall hassle, but this was not the case.  The appearance of the picture on the digital display compared to its appearance on a computer screen and ultimately the printed hard copy are all so completely different that it's turned out to be more of a headache than anything else.  Not having a photo printer to go with this wonderful technology, I resorted to utilizing one of the local drugstore's do-it-yourself print centers.  There were many editing options available (i.e., brightening, color removal/enhancers), but once again, what appeared on the screen and what actually printed were very different.  Luckily, the drugstore charges you ($6.99/sheet) only for those pictures you like and decide to take with you.  Through trial and error (15 different attempts at adjusting various differences in brightness and color ratios), I still only came marginally close to the print quality of a traditional 35mm photo.  In this respect, I'm very disappointed and disillusioned with this camera.  However, for on-line purposes, this is a fabulous investment.  I'm still wondering though how long it will take for us to realize any gain from this purchase.<br><br>
