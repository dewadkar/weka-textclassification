            Intended buyers include kayakers, skiers, mountain bikers, climbers and windsurfers, people who have been known to place the spiritual value of outdoor recreation over the material rewards of career. Scheduling your career around, say, fresh powder isn't the quickest way to financial wealth so car payments need to be kept in check. 

Nissan built the Xterra because outdoor gearheads need racks, baskets, water-resistant seatcovers, first-aid kits. All of which are available in the aftermarket--cheaper and just as functional as Xterra accessories. (Well, maybe roof-mounted gear baskets with airfoils aren't buyable, but that's what plastic milk cartons are for.) But if you want a basic rugged SUV that's not cushy, tiny, expensive or a Cherokee, one that has the cachet of new and different yet is proven under the skin, then it's definitely worth exploring to see how much you can get of what you need, without defeating that low-cost purpose. Or, if the value to you is in being cool, go for it.
