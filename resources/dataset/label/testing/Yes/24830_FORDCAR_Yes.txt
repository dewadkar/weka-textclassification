            Decided at the age of 46 it was time to find the right car for that mid-life crisis.  I selected a 2000 Laser Red Mustang GT Convertible.  The best I can say is that IT MOVES.  It is the muscle car I could not afford in the 70's.  It has a head turning quotient of 10!  The only problem I experienced was related to Ford's ability to deliver the car.  

The car was built August 4, but Ford did not get it to the dealer until September 10, and only after quite a bit of complaining by me.  The only answer they would give me is that it was because of a &quot;Quality Fix&quot; but couldn't or wouldn't tell me what it was.

Once it was delivered the Car had to be returned 3 times to correct a power steering leak.  The first time I took it in I told them the unit was cracked.  After the third trip in they finally replaced the cracked unit and realized it was not the hoses or the clamps.  

It only has 1800 miles, but I will be happy to keep you informed.  It is great to drive and hopefully will be my &quot;long term&quot; middle age crazy car.<br><br>
