            My 1st car was a 1992 teal green shadow! i loved it until it was totaled, but i loved this car sooo much i went out and bought a 1993 3 months after the accident. the 92 never had any major problems, the only thing i ever had to do was replace the belts and change the oil, normal up keep!! it had 104,000 and was still running great!
 It still runs great except for it has no passenger side of the car left! (but don't worry it held up great considering a full size chevy pick up with steel bumpers broadsided me!) My new 93 has 89,000 and it runs great! i am about to put new belts on this one too. It is beginning to sound like a cricket! but once i put the new belts on the 92 the cricket sound left! 
The only complaint i really ever had was the paint! the 92 had a spot about the size of a platter peeled off, but the 93 has been taken better care of and still has its paint in tack. As long as you take care of these little cars they are great! I think it is a great inexpensive car for a small family or a great 1st car! <br><br>
