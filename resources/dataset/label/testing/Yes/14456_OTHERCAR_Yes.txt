            My first impressions of the Camry sedan conjured up words such as &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;bland&quot;, and &quot;boring&quot;, but that was before I actually got inside.  Yes, while it's true the interior carries much of the dullness that belies the exterior, for some reason you don't seem to notice, or just don't car, as everything is in easy reach and works just like it should.  Great ergonomics.

Fire up the 3.0 V6 with the windows up and you cannot hear the engine at all, so it's obvious Toyota has done their homework in reducing noise, vibration and harshness levels.  Even during regular driving the interior remains very well hushed, and noticeable levels of noise only intrude when driving the car very hard.

Although the V6 engine and smooth automatic transmission work together well, performance is uninspiring, with a 10.5 second sprint required to bring on 100km/h from rest.  Still, this is a great sedan for what it is, and for the price it represents fantastic value.  4 stars.<br><br>
