            I have had quite a few cars including sports cars, pickup trucks, and compact cars.... this one has to be the most fun I have ever had driving a car!  It has a V-6, but it sure feels like a V-8, and I'm just waiting to find a V-8 on the interstate after my initial recommended 6000 miles of "easy driving at under 65-70mph" are over. I have a V-6 camaro as well, and let me tell you, there is NO comparison.  This one just whips up on the camaro, and for almost the same cost as the V-8 Z28.  I have never really been a fan of Nissan that much really, other than the previous 300Z (that I couldn't ever afford then,) so I told myself when I had the chance to get this one, I was going to do it!  I am glad I did too!!  

Off the line, the power is awesome at 287HP @ 6200 RPM and 274 ft-lb torque @ 4800 RPM.  I will be updating this after my initial 6000 mile period to let you know the full aspect of this.  I have let into the gas though, and it is nothing short of awesome, especially with the 6 speed manual that I have chosen.  I would not go with an automatic in this car for sure, unless you have no other choice.  Cornering is good too, pretty comparable to my 95 camaro that I currently have as well.  

I initially bought this car with a motive of selling it for a profit, since I got it for sticker price for ordering 6 months ago, but when I picked it up a week ago, I couldn't let it go.  I ordered the Track version, and got it loaded up with the navigational system with all available options, with NO regret! The color I chose was Red, and it looks too good, let me tell you!  I have never owned a red car, but this one sure looks great!  I also recommend the leather seating, it is really comfortable, I didn't have anything to compare it to, but what I got I am completely satisfied with!!!!

If you can't tell I am a satisfied customer, if you have any questions feel free to leave me a response and I will get back with you... I will be updating this as the life of the car goes along, as I have done with my other 2 cars on here. 

This one is the 2003 model, the option for it only goes to 2002, I will recommend it to everyone I see, and anyone who stops me and asks me about it, which is pretty regularly in the short amount of time I have had it.  I have 900 miles on it, so I have had a little bit of time to play on it!!!

GO GET ONE IF YOU CAN!!!
