            I purchased a new 2000 Honda Civic LX.  It reminds me so much of our old Honda Accord, 1983.  The new Civic has get up and go.  It is quick to respond and easy to get around in.  I'm 6'2&quot; and there is plenty of room in the front seats.  The rear is slightly cramped.  The luggage area, the trunk is a good size.  There is enough room for luggage for a weekend.  It wouldn't be my choice for a long travel.
Gas mileage, it hasn't been what was listed on the window.  I have never hit 35 mpg.  The best was 31 mpg.  I have had a low of 18 mpg.  I was hoping more for the 35 mpg.  Time will tell, when I start commuting to work daily.  
The car is easy to operate.  There are no difficult buttons or knobs.  This is a simple straight forward car.  If you are looking for good car for a little money, the Honda Civic is your car.  It has power windows, doors, mirrors, cruise, A/C and power steering, all for less than $15,000.00.  A true bargin.  I love my new Honda Civic LX!<br><br>
