            About a year ago, I was given the chance to find out all the nitty gritty about the Oldsmobile Alero in a GM training session.  I got to test the Alero against it's main competitors such as the Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima, Ford Countour, and Dodge/Chrysler Stratus/cirrus.  Even though it was a training sponsored by GM, I still have to say that the Alero beats its competition hands down.

The styling is very attractive and I prefer the Alero looks to the Grand Am (it's sister car in the Pontiac line) because it is much more conservative than the bubbly Grand Am styling.  The engine in the Alero, whether it be the 4 or 6 cylinder, has great low end torque -- so getting up to highway speed on a short entrance ramp is no problem.  There were no other cars that we tested that could beat the Alero in an entrance ramp lengthed race.  I didn't get to test the 4 cylinder Alero against the 6 cylinder Chrysler, but I would bet that the Alero would still be faster than the Chrysler.

The seats are very comfortable and there is a lot of room in the back seat -- especially for a compact car.  The back seats also sit up nice, unlike the Honda Accord where it feels like you are nearly laying down.  

The rear window defrost actually sends the initial spurt to the center of the window (behind the rearview mirror), so visibility is gained much quicker than in other cars.

The pass-through to the trunk is actually large enough to be worthwhile in the Alero -- unlike the Honda that has about a 1 foot square opening from the back seat to the trunk.
