            My first experience with a Sony digital camera was Sept. 1999 when a friend of mine brought his on a trip to Italy. I fell in love with several of the features, and decided that if I ever had the funds to get a digital camera this would be the one.

In May, I graduated from graduate school and was given the Sony MVC-FD83 camera as a gift. The person who bought it for me knew that was the type of camera I wanted, and it has been a joy to have.

I'm sure most of the features of this camera have been detailed elsewhere, so I'll just focus on my favorite things and the few remaining wishes for the camera.

The reasons I love my camera:
1. Floppy disks- You can never run out of them. They are easily portable to anyone's computer without all the fancy cables, cards, and software sometimes necessary. I have recently used the disk copy feature as well so I could share my pictures at a party--right on the spot!

2. MOVIES- If a picture is worth a thousand words, then my mini-movies must be worth a million. 

3. Picture quality- I'm not the world's best photographer, but this camera takes great pictures! And even if I am a little out of focus, I can see that right away and reshoot the picture.

Things I wish my camera would do:
1. Movie lighting- I wish there was some way you could use the flash while you are shooting a movie. I'm not sure how that could be implemented since you need continuous light rather than a sudden burst, but it would be nice.

2. Sideways movies- I have yet to figure out how to play an MPG rotated 90 degrees because I shot it with the camera turned. I can always turn my head to watch it, but it's not the same.

3. Menus- I don't have time to mess with menus when I'm trying to catch action. I find the movie times especially hard to scroll through, but I can always just set it to 5 seconds and hold the button down for longer movies.

Overall, I love my camera and have been incredibly pleased with my photos, movies, and the ease of use. I highly recommend the Sony family for it's wonderful features!<br><br>
