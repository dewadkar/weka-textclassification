            My family bought a 1990 Dodge Caravan SE V6 in 1993.  We bought it off of our grandma's neighbor for $8,000.  It was then 3 years old and in good condition because the family who owned it before us had logged 60,000 mostly freeway miles on it.  Since then we have put about 100,000 miles of our own on it, on tough, curvy country roads.  It has survived countless road trips over steep mountains and freeways alike.  It has also survived outright abuse.  Before we bought our own four wheel drive, my brother and I have actually wheeled this vehicle through thick mud and up tough hill climbs where even four wheel drive vehicles have had difficulty.  Many of my friends have stared in awe at what the van has been able to do.  It has also survived a race with a BMW (in which I must say we fared pretty well) and a collision with a deer in which it's stout steel panels weathered no damage while the deer certainly did.
  
The only downside of this vehicle is that we have gone through three sets of front struts (I would advise getting ones with a lifetime warranty) and  two sets of rear shocks.  This is understandable however because of the constant wear inflicted upon them on very curvy roads.  The Brake pads have also been replaced numerous times and the rotors had to be returned twice again because of steep hills and curvy roads.  

It is still going strong after 7 years and is a testament to the quality of these vehicles.<br><br>
