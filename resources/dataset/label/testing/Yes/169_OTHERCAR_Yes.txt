            I recently purchased a Fuji MX-1200 digital camera from Mercata.com (the bid-down the price website.)

At first I was a little taken aback by the Camera's small size -- just slightly larger than a deck of cards.  Put really, it is very portable -- it can fit in your pocket -- it takes good pictures, and is really easy to use.

At 1.2 Million Pixels the camera produces images with decent resolution.  No one is going to mistake these pictures for professional quality pictures, but for one of the cheapest digital camera's on the market, it works great!

It's fun to snap some pictures of the kids, and look at them on the LCD screen on the camera.  Load them into the computer, email them to grandma.  Can't beat that!  So far I am on my initial battery -- so battery life appears to be decent to good (Maybe excellent -- it hasn't worn out yet!)

The flash works well, the (digital) zoom works well, the camera is easy to use.

If you are looking for a Digital Camera to play around with, the Fuji MX-1200 does the job for a very competitive price.

Recommened.

-- Update --

Recently I uploaded some of my pictures taken with this camera to ememories.com and had those pictures printed out on photographic paper (just like a 35MM picture) -- and they really turned out great.  I am really starting to think that my point-and-shoot 35 MM camera can be completely replaced by this digital camera!<br><br>
