            I purchased my new 1999 Chevrolet Malibu LS after a long evaluation period of other cars.  The competition, for me, included the Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Alero, Honda Civic, and Volkswagen Jetta.  After test driving all those cars, it was clear the Malibu was the "best" for me.

The Malibu has the most spacious interior of any of the cars I tested.  It's simple and functional.  To compare, the Alero was much more cluttered and the Jetta felt cramped.  I'm 6'2" and had plenty of leg room, shoulder room, and could even fit in the back seat without much complaint.  The trunk is also very spacious.

In driving, the Malibu has plenty of power.  My LS has a 3.1L V6 engine which gives it plenty of passing power, and it cruises very quietly at 65 mph.  The Civic was underpowered, but the other cars had good performance.  In fact, I really liked the Alero's 3.4L V6 engine.  The Alero I drove was a very snappy car!  Still, the Malibu was very good.

I give the Malibu above-average marks in ride quality too.  Compared to the other cars I drove, the Malibu had one of the softest rides.  Some may not want a soft ride, but for a mid-size sedan, it seemed appropriate.  This is no sports coupe.  

The Malibu is missing one feature that I really want: traction control.  I live in Minnesota, and traction control would be great to have on our snowy roads in the winter.  It is of course front-wheel drive, so it won't handle terribly in the snow, but it only makes sense for Chevrolet to have traction control on this car.  They offer it on the Cavalier, but not the Malibu...

I chose the leather seats and sunroof options, and am very pleased with the leather seats.  They are VERY comfortable.  Unlike a lot of bucket seats, they are mostly straight, yet supportive.  I don't like the fancy seats some cars have, which crimp you in the sides...  So the seats are a big plus to me.  

The sunroof is ok, but it does make a lot of wind noise at highway speeds.  There's a technical reason for this: the sunroof tils up & out, sliding back over the roof of the car.  This is because the roofline is so short, there's not enough room for the sunroof to slide into the car's roof.  That's the downside of having a car with a smaller roofline.

Overall this is one of the best cars I've owned and driven.  In recent history I owned a 1996 Chevy Blazer, and then a 1997 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34, and I've had a good history with General Motors cars.  The Malibu is definately the best car I've driven from GM.  And I highly recommend it to my friends who are looking for a high quality mid-sized sedan.

Definately worth a test drive.

<B>Update June 2002</B>
After having owned this car for nearly three years, I thought it a fitting time to give an update.

I have had two problems with the Malibu in the course of 58,000 miles.

One, the brake rotors got warped around 24,000 miles.  This is very premature.  The pads weren't shot, just the rotors got warped.  Chevrolet replaced them under warranty.  The service manager commented that he'd seen a lot of that.

The brake rotors are again warped, I'm afraid.  I checked the brakes several months ago, after noticing them pulsate  during braking.  The pads were in fine shape, so I didn't do anything about it.  The rotors being warped is a nuisance, but not a safety hazard.  When the pads do need to be replaced, I won't go with Chevrolet rotors.  Next time I'll be installing Raybestos rotors.

Two, the cooling system developed a pin-hole leak on a hose at around 40,000 miles.  I was afraid the intake manifold gasket was defective because it was using coolant with no apparent leaks.  I had heard horror stories of this from other people (with other cars).  I confessed my fears to the local Chevrolet dealer, but they insisted that while possible, it was unlikely, and they'd find the problem & let me know.  They pressure-tested the system & found a pinhole leak from a hose.  I think the bill was about $100 to replace the hose.  Not a "great deal", but they were honest and fast.

Three, the anti-theft system, GM Passlock II, kicked on unintentionally around 48,000 miles.  It would be occasional.  Sometimes I'd get in to start the car, and it wouldn't start & the theft indicator light would light up.

When that happens, you have to wait about 15 minutes before you can try starting the car again.  It would always start right away after waiting.

Very inconvenient though.  Fortunately it didn't happen at a gas station or anything like that.  That cost me several hundred dollars to repair.  They isolated it to either a faulty sensor or wiring harness.  I had them replace both & be done with it.  The problem has not re-occurred.

If I were buying a used Malibu today, the chief problem I would look for is pulsating brakes during braking.  If they seem to pulsate when you pull up to a stoplight, there's a good chance they have faulty pads and/or rotors & need to be replaced.  I would not go to a Chevrolet dealer to have this done!  Go somewhere else.

Otherwise I have been happy with our Chevrolet dealer.

So, three problems in three years and nearly 60,000 miles.  Maybe $400 in repairs.  I think that's a fine record for modern cars where so much can go wrong.

Oh, and it's about time to replace my factory tires.  I won't be going with Firestones.  The factory Firestone tires have performed unremarkably.  They are fairly quiet, but don't grip the pavement very well during turns, nor do they grip the pavement well in rain or icey conditions.

(Yes, I'm somewhat biased, since my recent memory is of their performance with not much tread left... but they've never been "great")
