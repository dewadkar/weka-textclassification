            This past spring I decided to purchase a digital camera. I managed to work out a budget of  $500 for this purpose. After spending about 6 hours one night reading all I could find on the net about digital cameras that would fit into my price range, I decided on the Kodak DC-280. There are better cameras for sure, but I'm not sure there is a better one for this price range. Anna (My wife) and I have been very delighted with this camera.

The only negative I have about the purchase experience is that I feel I got a little gypped by Egghead.com, whom I purchased the camera from. Every advertisement and review that I read on this camera mentioned that it came with a 20 Meg compact flash card. That is standard with this camera. If you go look at the Kodak web site, you will see 20 Meg. I made price comparisons and chose Egghead. They shipped the camera with an 8 Meg card. I have since looked at the posting on Egghead.com, and it does in fact list the 8 Meg card. I wasn't legally cheated but I do feel there was a little slight of hand here. You can bet I'll pay close attention to what I buy from them in the future.

I have also purchased the Tiffen lens set ($167) for this camera. One problem with this setup is that the lens body blocks quite a bit of the view finder area. Not a huge problem but is a fact. The macro lenses are great, so is the wide-angle lens. I am not going to clamor too much over the telephoto lens. This is supposed to be a 2X lens, I have my doubts. I'm not fully satisfied with the sharpness of images taken with the telephoto lens. Overall though, I guess I would have to say that the lens set is a worthwhile addition to this camera.

This camera is easy to use, takes great pictures and for about $50 a compact flash reader makes getting the images into the PC a breeze as well as fast. We went ahead and bought a couple more 16 Meg cards. That gives us 40 Megs to walk around with. That's a bunch of pictures. If your price range is in the $500 area, I strongly recommend this camera.
