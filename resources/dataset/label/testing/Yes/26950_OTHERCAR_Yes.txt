            Toyota was always been known to make cheap, dependable, and decent looking cars. They 1998 Toyota Camry has an unusal look but if you are someone who doesn't care about your car's looks then who cares right? Well anyway, this Camry drives around like any other one. It is very quiet inside and is very dependable. 

The exterior of the Camry can be very ugly to people. The rear lights look smushed up and the front lights look like they are always dirty. When i look at this car, i imagine an old lady driving it or an old man. But some people don't care, i mean if it drives,it drives right?

The Interior of the Camry is really nice, the front driver and passenger all have lots of foot room. The rear passengers on the other hand don't have that much foot room and it may be REALLY uncomfortable for three adults to fit back there. Toyota has yet to get rid of the bump in the middle of the floor. Unlike Honda, who has already been taking those annoying bumps out. Like i said before, the interior is really nice. Some might find the seats very comfortanble but i tihnk that they are too soft and the head reast are so uncomfortable. Don't hate me for saying this, but i think that it is true. The stereo systems seems ok but there are too many open pockets. Many things in the interior break very easily. such as the coin holder and other things that i can't think of right now.

This car has a decent amount of head room which is good for tall people. The steering wheel is nice and big, but some might not like that. The trunk is huge! The rear seats fold down so that you can get to the trunk through the interior of the car. This car however, doesn't have the emergency open in the trunk. The 2000 and 2001 on the other hand have them. 

This car is nice and dependable and you should really look into buying this car despite all the flaws
