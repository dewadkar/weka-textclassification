              The first van I ever bought was a 1990 Dodge Ram van. With only a couple of kids at the time, our family found this vehicle to be indispensable. We bought it for the roominess and comfort it afforded all of us. It was mechanically sound, so when we were in the market for another van. With two additions to the family, we knew just where we would go to purchase another one in 1999.
  We looked at the 1999 Dodge Caravan, and found it to be exceptionally roomy and accessible with the dual rear sliding doors. It also gave us a sense of luxury, along with economical operation. Our repairs have been minimal, and although it doesn't get great gas mileage, one has to weigh the pros with the cons. We decided the van was an absolute necessity with the size of our family. 
  The Dodge Caravan handles more like a car than a van. The engine is peppy-not sluggish-because Dodge has fine-tuned their multi-port fuel injection system that allows for maximum power with no extra drawbacks in fuel economy.
  I recommend this van to anyone, not just large families. There is room for hauling most anything, from people to cargo. I highly recommend it.<br><br>
