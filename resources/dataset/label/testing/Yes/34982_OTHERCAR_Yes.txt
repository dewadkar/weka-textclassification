            25 year old single males arent supposed to want to own Buicks.  Definitely, I am not in their general category of demographics.  And, honestly, I didnt think I wanted a buick either.  Until I sat in the Buick Century 99 I didnt know what I was missing.  This car rides smoothly, like a boat or a plane cutting through the water and/or air.  Very big and spacious without looking like the old A frame style of Buick.  To me, it is the perfect mid size combo of luxury, style, performance, and value out there, American or otherwise.
It has an excellent factory stereo system, and I am getting about 21-30 mpg depending on city or highway.  There are a few features I will want in my next car this doesnt have like a sunroof, or maybe a bigger back seat (although this one is pretty good), but I also know that the full sized buicks are more than likely where I will go after this one.  I have never been happier with a car ever<br><br>
