            I recently read a review about the 1992 Mercury Sable Station Wagon.  Sadly, the review was unhappy, and unimpressed with the automobile.  I too, was sad after reading her work, because my experience with the �Sable Wagon� has been so positive, that I was saddened she did not have the same great experience.

Now, my Mercury Sable Station Wagon is a 1990.  We purchased it new, as a �left-over� in April of 1991.  I was very reluctant to become a station wagon mom, but with two little ones and a very busy lifestyle, the need for a station wagon outweighed the desire for a sedan.

Our car came complete with a luggage rack, electric windows and seats, am/fm stereo with a tape deck, rear window washer and defroster, air conditioning and heating, power steering and brakes, automatic transmission, and multi speed windshield wipers.  We have upholstered seats, and little foot carpets to protect the carpeting in the interior.  We have a third seat in the very back, that seats two children comfortably.  There is a special compartment for the spare tire, and the tools needed to change the tire.  The car also has child lock doors.  When activated, the rear doors will only open from the outside.  This feature was well appreciated when our children were small and thought nothing about opening and closing car doors!!!  The driver has a �master control pad� that allows he or she to access all of the car windows and door locks.  That too was a feature that helped me control keeping little arms and hands inside the car.

I guess what keeps me so attached to this car is the two accidents we have had while driving it.  Both were quite serious for the car, but no one in the car was injured.  We walked away from both accidents, without a scratch. I know that we are lucky that we were safe, but I also believe that the construction of our Mercury Sable had something to do with our protection.  The car�s inner structure is similar to a cage.  When it was hit, the fuel line immediately cut off, preventing any further fuel to pass to the engine.  The body of the car was damaged, but not the inner structure.  The car was repaired and the only difficulties we had were with insurance companies and body shop deadlines!!!

There have been several recalls on my car.  I can�t remember all of them, but Ford has been very good at notifying us, and making good on the problem parts.  We have moved since purchasing the car, and now deal with another Ford dealership.  We still receive notification when something has been recalled on the car.  I would say this has happened about 5 times since 1991.

As many cars age, things do seem to go wrong.  We have had to replace parts of the joints that control the turning of the tires.  We live in the northeast, and the salt used on the roads during the winter deteriorated these parts of the underbody.  We have replaced brakes once, and the mechanics had great difficulty adjusting the rear brakes.  Now it seems we are having difficulty getting the front end to align completely.  

We have never had any engine type problems.  We have never had any trouble with the transmission, power steering, or the electrical system.  We do keep up the maintenance on the car, but even that has not been as much of an issue as previous cars we have owned.  Way back when I started driving, Ford�s reputation in my hometown was not very good.  �Fix Or Repair Daily� was the acronym attributed to any Ford product.  I must admit, that my experience with our 1990 Sable has been the total opposite. Our car has just under 70,000 miles on it.  The body is not rusting, but the car has always been garage kept. 

The new Mercury Sable Station Wagons, and sedans have a new body style.  They are still similar to the Ford Taurus, very sleek and very distinctive.  They are still a very unique driving experience.

Sadly, it has come time for us to think about trading in our Sable Wagon.  We have had such a good experience with this Ford product, that at present we are considering purchasing another vehicle.  Our family has grown, so we will not be purchasing another station wagon, but a 4-door sedan.  I am fully confident, that if we do purchase another Mercury, our experience will be the same.
