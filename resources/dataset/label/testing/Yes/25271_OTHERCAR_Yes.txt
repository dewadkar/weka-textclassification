            the land cruiser is in a league of its own when it comes to SUV's.

Pros:

Powerfull V8 (235 hp), Fast, very quiet, good looks(the roof rack, even if you dont need it, makes it look even nicer, its a well worth option)
It is fantastic to drive, doesnt feel powerless like the ford expedition, and it handles like a dream. Very nice interior.

Cons:

The sound system! I think its a joke, 7 speakers (1 is a subwoofer).
I heard a nakamitchi system is available on the lexus LX470, but dont spend $10,000 more for the same car people. spend 10,000 on a decent sound system instead!! hehe <br><br>
