            September 1999, we bought our daughter a Kia Sephia LS for her 21st birthday.  She loves it!!   The Kia has much more legroom in the backseat and the same kind of ride as a 97 Jetta.  I have read some complaints from people mostly about the dealers, however we have had great experiences with our service.  The engine light did turn on(a problem that seems to happen to everyone I know driving Audi, Saab, VW, or Dodge) but within an hour the service was complete.  We were told it occurs when you fill the tank without turning off the car.  We also complained of gas spurting out when you finish filling it up and found out that Kia just recalled them for this problem.  We had the factory service performed and the problem stopped.  The car is loaded, even has a CD player, for a very reasonable price.  It is over a year old, has around 12000 miles, and we are very satisfied with our purchase.<br><br>
