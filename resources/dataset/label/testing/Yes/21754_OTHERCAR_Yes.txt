               When i first got this car i thought it was really neat looking and it seemed to drive very well.  But that only lasts for like a year then it starts falling apart very slowly.  Before i begin on how unhappy i am with my car i just wanted to say that i even got screwed by leasing this car.  I can't believe that i got my self caught up in a lease i have never leased before this and now i never will, it sure does cost alot.  My car never seems to want to go when i push the gas, and it clicks alot everywhere.  The gas tank don't even read right either.  But i am stuck for another year and a half so i will have to survive but i will tell you i will never lease again and never buy a chevy. I recommend you don't either not if you want something reliable.<br><br>
