            When our daughter was six months old, after many long trips back and forth visiting grandparents in our small Mazda, my husband and I decided we needed a bigger car.  As young parents (27 years old), we almost caved in and got a more socially acceptable SUV;  then we saw the Odyssey.  I had no qualms about getting a minivan, any minivan, at such a young age; my husband, on the other hand, was worried about his image.  

I convinced my husband to look at minivans, and after much looking, the Odyssey was the only one he considered.  Also, after test driving several SUVs, my husband realized that the Odyssey was more practical than both any other minivan and all SUVs for many reasons.  

First, it drives more like a car and gets better gas mileage.  I've learned the truth to this after driving my brothers Tahoe and even my fathers Town &amp; Country.  There is tons more room in the Odyssey than any SUV we looked at, and it's bigger than all of the other minivans.  More of a bonus than I ever realized are the automatic doors.  Both side doors can be opened from the front seat with the touch of a button.  You never have to manually open or close the doors either;  you just lift the handle and they open or close. You can also open and close the doors with your keyless entry keychain.  

You can read about all of the features somewhere else, but I'll give a quick rundown of some of the seemingly minor perks that really do make the car better.  You can adjust the radio volume on your steering wheel, which really is safer.  You can set the AC as different temps in the front and back, the back seat folds down easily with just one hand, the two front seats can slide together. 

The only negative aspect of this car is the fact that leather seats are not an option.  We've always had leather seats and found them easier to clean and maintain.  And they are just more comfortable.  I've heard that it will be a feature on later models. 

My (now) 17 month old is happy riding in the Odyssey because she is up high enough in her car seat that she can easily see out the window and the temperature can be adjusted to suit her. 

My husband, though he at first felt that he was making a great sacrifice by getting a minivan, now proudly takes visiters to the driveway to give them demos of the features of his minivan.  He realizes that the minivan, especially this minivan, is the most practical car for a family--even just a family of three and a dog. <br><br>
