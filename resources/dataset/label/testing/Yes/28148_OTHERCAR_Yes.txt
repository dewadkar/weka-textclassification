            I grabbed this camera when Sams Club had a rebate for it, since I am horrible for getting film developed! At first I really liked it, learning some of the features fairly easily. But I found myself referring to the instructions too often when it came to using their LCD screen features.

I have used this camera for adding photos to web sites and it works very well, taking sharp, crisp pictures.  It is nice to view the photos on the screen. You can also delete those that didn't come out quite right. 

Battery life is lousy, never lasting me more than 24 pictures. Uploading photos into the desktop goes very slow, so make sure you are in no hurry. 

They give you some bundled software, PhotoMax Pro and Image Maker software. Image Maker does a nice job of grouping your photos. I don't bother with PhotoMax Pro, since I use PhotoImpact to edit my photos. 

I would recommend this for someone starting out in digital photography, but be sure to pack a suitcase full of batteries if you plan on taking lots of pictures away from an outlet.
