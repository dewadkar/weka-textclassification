            I recently purchased a Rav4 for my daughter, who graduated from High School and was heading for college. I researched small suv's for sometime and narrowed my choices to the Rav4 and the Honda CRC. While both are quality vehicles, and I would have purchased either, I was able to get the best deal on the Rav4. The CRC seemed to be scarce, and the dealer's lack of inventory made negotiating nearly impossible. I worried that the lack of CRC available and the abundance of Rav4's signaled a superior product in the Honda, but I have found great quality in the Toyota. She has already accumulated 7000 miles, and has yet to have so much as a rattle. It has a comfortable ride for the front passengers, but is a little crowded in the rear. The CRC did have a couple of inches more width in the back seats. It doesn't have severe lean on the turn, as many of the others  we test drove.(The Chevy/Suzuki Sidekick had severe lean in the turns)The gas mileage has been very good, at about 27 highway and 24 city. We chose the automatic LS version with most available options. This has, so far, been a quality vehicle for the money, and I feel secure in knowing my daughter is driving a car to and from school that is mechanically sound. <br><br>
