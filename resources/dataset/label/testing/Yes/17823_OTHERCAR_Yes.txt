            With its newly updated styling, the S-Class continues to impress with its gentlemanly manners.  Available in the States only as the long-wheelbase variant, the vehicle comes with 4 engine choices, ranging from the 275 horsepower V-8 to the 493 horsepower twin turbo V-12, and in the S430 and S500 there is the option of adding 4matic, Mercedes-speak for AWD.  There have been many recent new entries into the luxo sedan market: BMW introduced its controversial 7-series two year ago, this year introducing its V-12 760Li, and the folks at Audi sent us their new flagship, the all-new aluminum A8.  In a recent comparison test by Car and Driver, the S600 took top seat over the A8 and 7-series.

Mercedes have always had a reputation for solid, well performing luxury automobiles in the US. This S-class does not stray from the stereotype one bit.  It handles the road with aplomb--bumps are noticed enough to have a secure feeling of control, but do not shake the bums of the passengers enough to be considered harsh for the segment.  The power from the V-8s is strong, and the power from the V-12, although excessive for our roads, is neck-snappingly fast.

The interior of the vehicle is spacious and pleasing to the eye.  Yards of the finest, supple hides cover the comfortable 16-way adjustable seats and headrests and give off a nice aroma, appropriate amounts of high quality burled walnut woods are used in a tasteful way, and smart chrome accents detail the dashboard.  It is easy to find a comfortable spot in the drivers seat, and the view over the stately hood with the three pointed chromed star at the end is confidence inspiring. The gauge cluster is a very easy to read electroluminescent setup, with a large speedometer dominating the display. At the heart of the dash is the command system, updating this year to make it more user friendly.  The rear passengers enjoy leg room that would satisfy the tallest NBA player, and the seats and headrests coddle the body in a comfortable, yet not fatiguing, manner.  By way of pitfalls, the cupholders are useless.  When will Europeans understand that Americans need a cupholder for each passenger's Big Gulp?

Exterior styling has been updated as well.  The front grill has been updated to be more prominent, and the fore and aft light clusters have been changed. Even so, the S-class retains its understated yet ageless beauty.  The exterior styling lets you know that this car is of the finest vehicles on the market, yet doesn't do so in an garish way as many think Munich's 7-series does. Seventeen inch wheels, new for this year, are standard equipment and do a better job of filling the wheel wells and keeping the vehicle in proportion than the 16 inchers of last year.
For your cargo needs, trunk space is ample, able to swallow more than 15 cubic feet.

Safety, Mercedes's forte, is omnipresent in an unobtrusive way. Curtain airbags, side airbags for front and rear outboard passengers, and smart airbags which monitor whether or not the passenger is buckled in, how heavy he/she is, and adjusts the speed at which it releases accordingly.  Pre-safe, which senses danger and moves the passenger seat to a safer position, closes the moonroof, and tightens seatbelt slack, Electronic Stability Program, Automatic Slip Control, Airmatic Air Suspension, Brake assist, Electronic Brake Force Distribution, large ventilated brakes with anti-locking system, and numerous other electronic gizmos abound.

All Mercedes-Benz vehicles come with a limited 4-year, 50,000 miles warrantee, and for that period scheduled maintenance is included.

I personally have had my S500 for almost 6,000 miles, and I have nothing but positive things to say. I opted for the White exterior and Beige interior, which, in my opinion, is the perfect color combination for such a vehicle.  It looks clean and stately.  I did not care for the gray interior--somehow the color looked a little cheap.  Perhaps the gray clashes with the wood trim, which is the root of this feeling.
