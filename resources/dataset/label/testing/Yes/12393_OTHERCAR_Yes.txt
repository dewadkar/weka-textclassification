            I think that the Jeep Wrangler is the best Jeep out there.  It can go off road, it takes little gas, and it just looks nice.  Right now I have a small Jeep of a different model (unmentioned), but I hope to buy a Jeep Wrangler soon. I like the 2000 SE Sport Utility, but it doesn't have to be a 2000.  It might catch all the bumps in the road, but compared to my Jeep it's a smooth ride.  I test-drove a 1994 Sport Utility and loved it! I think that this ride is good for just about anybody, except for older ladies.  But most of all I would like to see me in one.  About the tipping over when turning sharp corners, you get used to it.<br><br>
