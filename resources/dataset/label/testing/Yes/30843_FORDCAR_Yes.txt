            Women, this vehicle is for you! If you like a &quot;high ride&quot; with great visibility, plenty of storage room, comfort and ease of ride, then this vehicle is for you. I bought my Explorer because of all the Sport Utility Vehicles that I 

test drove, this one presented me with the best ride. The cloth seats are comfortable, I like driving high enough to be able to see the road, I like large vehicles to protect my in case of an accident, and living in 

the country I have to travel to the recycle center and didn't want a truck for the long miles that I travel to work each day. This vehicle was perfect.

Then I began encountering what I later learned were the known faults with this vehicle. The brakes chatter and need constant repair. The transmission is not reliable. When traveling through the mountains, the transmission died. It was difficult to get another one in Virginia where it stopped working.

I am surprised that Ford has not recalled the 1990-1993 Explorers and checked all brakes. My mechanic said that it is a known fault in the Explorers of these years. I have test driven several different makes 

of new Sport Utility Vehicles and still like the Explorer for large cargo capacity, excellent visibility, and comfort of ride. I just hope the brake and transmission problems have been corrected. I love my Explorer!
