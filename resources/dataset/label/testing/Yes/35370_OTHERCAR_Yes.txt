            Exterior:  (10/10) The sporty exterior is fun.  Due to its clean lines, it will never go out of style.  The alloy wheels look rich.  Friends hardly believe me when I tell them that it is 10 years old.  Chalk it up to Japanese engineering!

Interior: (7/10) The interior, at least on my GS, is a graphite colored upholstery with black trim (dashboard, manual controls, etc.), matching the black exterior.  While it may look chic, however, it can be scorching hot on a summer day.  
The seats would be more comfortable if they were softer.  They have a sports-car, low, stiff, feel to them.  
There is not much to complain about with this car.  The controls and gauges are arranged in a sensible way, close to the driver and easy to use.  My only beef is with the cup holders.  When the glove box lid is opened, one finds that there are two slightly recessed circles meant to hold drinks.  I wonder who designed these, because they certainly would not stabilize a drink while driving. So if you are a Starbucks junkie, you may have a few problems.
Also, I would not recommend this car to anyone who has a large frame, whether horizontally or vertically.  This car was definitely designed for the smaller to average person.  That is not to say that someone of larger stature would not love this car, but just that they might enjoy driving something larger like an SUV or van.  On the other hand, my dad, who is 6'3" drives my car every chance he gets.

Engine: (9/10) The 1992 GS has a 140 hp 1.8L Dual Overhead Cam engine.  It's a nice engine because it can accelerate well.
Some say that the engine gets a little "buzzy" at highway speeds.  The engine does "rev" slightly higher than average at high speeds, but is not that loud.

Handling: (10/10)  The handling is better than I expected it too be.  It corners those turns like nobody's business.  Very responsive.  Comparable to a low-end BMW.

Ride: (9/10)  I have received compliments on the smoothness of this car's ride, surprising because it is a smaller car.  This is likely because the Integra is a lower car than many small cars, therefore absorbing more bumps.

Reliability: (10/10) It's a Honda. It will probably last until my grandchildren are born. 

Value:  (10/10) This is probably the best value you will get for your dollar, when looking at the older sporty hatchbacks, for it's reliability, economy, and style.
