            If you wallet is thin, and you want great value in a small car, the Chevrolet Cavalier is for you.  I own two Cavaliers, both 1996 models and think very highly of them.  In 1995, Chevrolet redesigned the car and did some remarkable changes. Not only was the body jazzed-up (the boxy shape now a thing of the past), but they added dual air bags and anti-lock brakes.  The handling and ride are exceptional! Reliability has been very good (both my cars have 50k + miles..no problems yet!). When my 17 year old daughter got her first car I insisted it should be a Cavalier.  I wanted her to have a Cavalier because safety features gave me peace-of-mind.  She did not object because she loves the look of her black 2 dr coupe.  The only negative experience has been some minor interior hardware problems (a few molded plastic parts coming loose, etc.)  Last time I looked, Consumers Reports recommends the Cavalier - their recommendation is usually reserved for the elite Japanese cars.  If you are looking at a 1995 or newer Cavalier..go for it!
