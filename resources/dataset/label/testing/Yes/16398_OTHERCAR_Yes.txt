            This is a classic beauty!  No matter what year it is, it still carries it looks, and lets just say this car has everyone doing a double take.

My girlfriend owns this car, a red one, and boy does she look hot cruising this thing around!

I borrowed it for the day, and I had the time of my life!  If you read any of my previous reviews you'll know that I am short, 5&quot; so you can imagine that I am having problems with reaching the clutch.  Nothing I can't solve though!  This car is made for tall people because even if I bring the seat up I still can't reach for the clutch!  Problem was solvable, I will make sure I can solve it just to drive it!  I wore my 3&quot; heels and had a back pillow, now I was in style!

The deep rumble of the exhaust just turns me on!  The clutch is so easy to manage!  You don't have to have impecable timing to change gears and hell you'll never stall.  I guess that varies depending how well you drive standard.  I was cruising around in the city I realized that there really is no use to change to third gear, I swear you can pretty much drive this car in second with out any problems.  It handles very well and it's just mean!

The interior is boring, nothing special but what do you expect, it's all performance baby!  My friend installed a crazy system in the car though.
The sub is in the front kick and you couldn't even tell if there was a system or not.  This car is good with the top off, I hate the plastic windows with the zippers, just annoying.  I have one problem that I always run into with this car, being the driver or a passenger, I always hurt myself getting out.  The exhaust runs along the side of the car so it gets really warm after driving it for a while and if you're not careful getting out you'll burn the side of your legs, so ladies watch out!

I really did get to boot this car and it is incredible at fast speeds.  You can't even tell how fast you're going!  Overall this car has my thumbs up!  Keep in mind gas is expensive but if you can affort the car, then you can afford the gas.<br><br>
