            Well, this camera is a little old now... it's out of production.  Agfa made a good move in focusing on lower end cameras now.. that's where the money is. :) ...

The camera operates well on 4 AA batteries.  Get some Lithion Ion batteries, they'll last long enough to shoot over 100 pictures, and time to upload to your PC.

Customer service was GREAT... I had a problem with my camera, (my fault, I dropped it one too many times)... they shipped a NEW camera to me, and PAID for a box for me to ship my old camera back.  Didn't cost a cent, and had a new camera in 2 days.  How many digitial photography companies do that?  I know Canon and Kodak don't!

The camera is a little bulky compared to newer cameras on the market, so don't expect to chuck it in your pocket and all is well.

It takes a time to warm up, when the green light flashes for a while... this can get annoying, but all digicams using a SmartCard do this. :/ ... I have 8 2MB cards (i got a good deal on them).. but I never end up using more than 2 at a time.

Picture quality is good, especially at 1024 x 768... when you compare it to these 1.3MT cameras out there... the picture quality isn't all that different.

It also has a nice LCD display on the top of the camera to tell how many pictures are left, what mode it's in, etc... many other brands just throw all this information on the colour LCD screen.. (wasting batteries all the time)... tsk, tsk, tsk.  Agfa made a good choice in adding this on the top of the camera.. you can use the viewfinder to take regular photos, review them on screen, delete or save...

Works very well... I recommend it.
