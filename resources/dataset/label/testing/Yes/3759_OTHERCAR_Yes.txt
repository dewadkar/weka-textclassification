                I am the owner of a 1989 Chevrolet Silverado 2WD pickup that just amazes me. The odometer reads 200,000 miles. We have had to replace 2 alternators and one transmission. The transmission went because I was a teenager driver a few years back and I enjoyed racing it in the quarter mile and power braking and stuff which is the reason for the tranny blowout. Not to mention I got it stuck twice and ran the heck out of it to no avail. The fact that the engine is still running strong after this abuse by me is amazing. The trucks condition is emmaculate. Everybody thinks it is a mid-nineties pickup because the paint quality is so good due to the fact that I am a neat freak when it comes to vehicles. The interior doesnt even have any rattles in it which is remarkable considering it has probably driven 10,000 miles worth of gravel roads at least. 

    The downsides of this truck is that after about an hour or two the seat gets a little uncomfortable. Also the light fiberglass provides a joy ride when the roads are icy because the automatic tranny likes to downshift when you do not want it too and the back end fishtailes violently sometimes. I love my Firebird Formula but this truck will always have the memories of being fun, reliable and recieving a lot of great looks.
