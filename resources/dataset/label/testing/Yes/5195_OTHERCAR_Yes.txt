            Honda coupe V6 is probably the best you can get in coupe category.  Before I decide to marry to Honda, I spent hundreds of hours doing homework.  Believe me, it's like choose your girl friend in crazy freshman party.  
I love the reliable quality and smooth engine. The engine works excellent from 1000rpm to 6000rpm and provide the powerful feeling your toe wants.  Also, I should credit its comfortable front seat and silk handling.  But road noise from tires is a little louder than I expected when I drive on rainy days.  Last thing to mention, it's a non smoking car.  
People who like reliable quality,high resale value,and cool outfit are terrific fit to Honda Coupe.  
On the other hand, NASCAR fan, family man with 5 kids,and smokers are not the type.<br>
