            When I started shopping for a mini-van I was currently driving a Taurus Wagon. I was used to a long vehicle so I was not concerned about the size of it, I just wanted something that everyone could sit in and not TOUCH each other. I have 2 children and my father also is taxied in our vehicle. I needed something with leg room for him and elbow room the the kids.
With my husband out of town I started looking at used vans during the week and we would talk about them during the weekend when he came in to see us. We were leaning toward the Ford Windstar, the Dodge Caravan or the Chevy Venture. Out of all three the Venture had more leg room and more inside goodies for the money. 
We found an extended model with a fourth door which is automatic. When we took this one for a test drive we knew this was the one. We have had more fun showing off the automatic door and the kids say &quot;Open sesame and close sesame&quot; when the door opens and closes. 
This van is a breeze to drive. I thought it would be like driving a pick-up truck but the only difference between the Venture and my old wagon is the height.
Anyone with children or parents (with stiff legs) should have one of these vans. The convenience is worth the price. As a matter of fact no family should be without one. <br><br>
