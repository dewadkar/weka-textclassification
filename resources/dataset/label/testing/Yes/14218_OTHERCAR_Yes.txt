            Let me let you in on a secret.  You can have a great, feature-rich 2 megapixel camera at a price that won't break your budget.  Impossible?  Not so.  Just look for the Casio QV-2000UX.

I bought this camera on the recommendation of a fellow Epinions member, and haven't been disappointed.  This camera gives you 2 megapixel resolution, super-fast USB downloads, and great features at a price below comparable cameras of similar resolution.

For less than $500, you get a camera that grows with you.  On one level, it gives you point-and-shoot simplicity, with sharp pictures and near-perfect color balance.  On another level, once you get the basics down, you can take advantage of the advanced features the camera offers, such as exposure compensation, manual aperture and shutter-speed control.  Then, when you need more space, this CompactFlash, IBM MicroDrive-ready camera can grow with you, giving you up to 340MB of storage.  It also gives you features you wouldn't expect from a camera of that price, such as AVI movies, panoramas, and quick and continuous shutters.

Generally speaking, I love the feel of this camera.  The LCD display gives you clear pictures and an intuitive menu interface, for both beginners and advanced users alike.  I also like the fast, easy-to-use USB driver and interface.  Just plug the camera in and you're good to go, with lightning-fast downloads.

I also love the picture quality...photos come out with excellent color balance, and natural colors with no distinguishable color distortion.

However, I really don't like the photo loading software that comes with the camera.  It downloads the pictures to your computer and uses your web browser to view the pictures.  However, I'm the type that needs total control over organization, and the way the software is set up, I cannot delete individual pictures without deleting the whole folder.  Fortunately, the USB driver allows you to access the camera like another disk drive; that's how I download my pictures.  Once on my hard disk, I can organize them into folders however I like.

Battery life?  Don't use alkalines in this one.  Not even Duracell Ultras; the ones that came with the camera didn't even last me a week.  The next time I bought batteries, I bought lithiums, and even after several weeks of use with the LCD on the batteries still indicate good power.

Bottom Line:  If you can do without the loading software, and can deal with the short battery life, the Casio QV-2000UX won't disappoint you with its picture quality and ease of use.

Oops...looks like I said too much.  Now that the secret's out...who knows what will happen?<br><br>
