            We bought our Hyundai in 1994.  I had a predisposition to dislike four bangers as well as front wheel drive but we wanted a new car, and that's what our price range offered.  I was driving over the road and therefore was unavailable to make usual repairs to our $50 1978 Chevy Caprice.  My wife needed a reliable car to wizz the kids around in.    

The new cars at our price in 94 were the Dodge Neon, The a Honda (I think it was the Civic), and of course the Hyundai Excel.  It seemed the Honda was best on gas but slowest, the Neon was fastest, but not so good on gas, and the Hyundai was in the middle.  In terms of price, the Hyundai was the lowest by a good measure.   

We bought the Hyundai, a 94 teal green 3 door model.  It was a good car, and came with a maintenance plan that included regular oil changes. The car was pretty much trouble free for about five years (46K) with the exception of a wind sound at the drivers door while on the highway.  They never could get that sorted out.  

Whoever says front WD is good in the snow never had the experience to handle a rear WD properly in the snow.  Every Front WD I owned or drove was awful in any significant snow and the Hyundai was no exception.  

Our problems came shortly after the payments ended.  There was a noise in the transmission (5 sp Manual) which turned out to be a bearing on one of the shafts.  This cost a bit to have done as you can imagine.  I wasn't interested in doing it myself and no one I knew would even think about it because they all worked on standard not metric, and rear WD not front WD.  
$700+ later we had the Hyundai back on the road, but it was never right.  There were always problems with the clutch. A few trips back to the repair shop yielded no noticeable improvements.  It seemed you could never quite adjust the clutch out of the carpet.  I think they either replaced it with the wrong clutch or assembled it wrong.  Anyway we drove it till we traded it about a year later.  

RECAP

The car ran great.  It was quick and maneuverable as well as good on gas.  It was a bit too small for two adults and three kids.  Some time after the youngest came out of the car seat, the lump in the middle of the back seat became an issue. Don't take it out in the snow.  We got 55K out of it and most of the time never had to worry if it would get us there.  We were mostly satisfied with the car and with the quality of workmanship from Hyundai.
