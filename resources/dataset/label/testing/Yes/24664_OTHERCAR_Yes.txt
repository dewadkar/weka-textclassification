            <b> This is an update on The 2000 Chevrolet Venture Passenger Special Edition Van my friend purchased in 2000 and of which I reviewed below on April 20, 2000.  With only one normal problem such as a new exhaust system due to severe winter salty (beach-area)  weather and 58,000 miles, she has had only one major problem. The vehicle kept stalling out at every stop light. The problem was first diagnosed in a diagnostic test as the fuel injector. However, after installing a new injector the van kept on stalling. She was reimbursed the labor from Chevy on this.  A new battery was installed too. Now after being in the shop several times, it was discovered that the problem was a very small pin shaft in the fuel line....cost under $10. The shaft was worn away about an eighth of an inch but enough to cause a month's worth of annoyance. With this tiny problem taken care of free of charge, the van is as good as new now and runs smoothly just like before. I asked Viv if the van was worth the price she paid for it in 2000 and her answer is "Absolutely...wouldn't trade my baby in for anything."</b>

Warner Bros. has teamed up with Chevrolet again,(last time with the Monte Carlo with Taz) this time with the new 2000 Venture Special Edition* 7-passenger (7 seatbelts) Passenger Van. This is a very stylish satin-finished silver mist colored mini-van with side moldings, aluminum hood and a roof of steel, also aluminum wheels and black wall tires. Bugs is on the pillar and tailgate (Bugs Bunny, that silly wabbit) of course.

I recently had the pleasant experience of riding and actually driving one of these vans that the owner purchased this past January. With 26 miles to the gallon, and a 25-gallon capacity gas tank, my friend, her daughter, myself and four children made way on Route 95 from Massachusetts to New Jersey. 

This Chevy Venture Warner Bros. Passenger Van is actually child-proof. I don't just mean the manual sliding passenger door (the Venture Cargo Van comes with powered sliding doors) in back with safety locks where as the door can only be opened from the outside or the standard integral child safety seat where Judy's baby sat comfortably sleeping. I mean the flip-down ceiling 5.4&quot; monitor and video player on the ceiling of the van between the front seat and back seat. We did not hear a peep from the kids the entire way to and from. That is what I call child-proof~ LOL.

As the children and their mother sat with headphones and &quot;I think I saw A Puddy Cat&quot; playing somewhere, Viv and I listened to our favorite oldies station on FM radio where they played &quot;409&quot;~  I remember saying to my friend how I recalled when that musical tribute first came out saluting the hot powered Chevy Impala SS. Wow! And I do recall the old Chevy commercials from the 50's and 60's. The dealer where this Venture Warner Bros. Special Edition* Van was purchased told her daughter that Chevrolet cars started back in the early 1900's.

This Warner Bros. Special Edition Mini Passenger Van comes with AM/FM stereo CD cassette. I loved the rear seat audio controls (which I tried on the trip back for a while) so the person in front can listen to Rock and Roll and the person in back can enjoy their favorite Classical music (or whatever music they enjoy) in addition to the little (or big) people in the middle who can watch their favorite video or even play a video game.

The front leather cloth inserted adjustable bucket seats (which are Scotch-guarded) were so comfortable and Viv had the pleasure of a 6-way power bucket seat because after all, the driver wants to be comfortable too. The kids and Judy were very also comfortable watching their cartoons strapped safely in their bucket seats in back. 

Later we stopped to get some lunch and Viv gave me the honor of driving this &quot;beauty&quot; the rest of the way to NJ. The power adjustable driver's seat was used with ease and with the the tilted wheel adjusted to my convenience (Viv is shorter than I) it was smooth driving all the way while she adjusted her seat to catch a little sleep. I longed to toot the horn to see how it sounded but didn't want to wake her.

The van's interior is gray and very neat looking. One small but really very important convenience is that there are cup holders in front, middle and back of the van so anyone sitting in the van can have access to their drinks without worrying if any liquid spilled. 

 Later while in NJ, I saw how the back bucket seats just easily folded to arrange the interior and make an island in the middle. I also found out that Judy's baby was sitting in a built-in car seat that does not come with the Venture Cargo Van, only this Special Edition* Passenger Van.

The Warner Bros. Venture mini 6-cylinder passenger van comes in 4 colors to choose from: dark blue sapphire, dark teal or dark red metallic and of course, the silver mist that I got to ride in and drive. The van comes with a built-in security system, front and rear air conditioning, remote control outside mirrors, deep tinted side and rear windows, and driver and front passenger &quot;front and side&quot; impact air bags, along with adjustable-height shoulder straps for extra safety. The compact spare mounted tire is under the floor at the rear of the van. I caught a glimpse of &quot;Bugs&quot; again while checking this. LOL!

I never liked vans before but I have changed my mind after the pleasure of being both a driver and a passenger in this one. The Chevy Venture Warner Bros. Edition* passenger van has a cute style, great performance and I believe will be a dependable long-lasting van that will go the distance with ease. Oh...I got to drive half the way home too! Beep! Beep!
