            Many people complain about the fact that it is un-American to buy a foreign car.  The bottom line is that they are superior in every aspect.  I bought a 98' Corolla in the summer of 98'.  Since then, I've put on 37,000 miles and my car runs as good, if not better than when I bought it.  She's as quiet as can be on the road, one time I really didn't know if the car was even on!  Don't let the compact size fool you either.  I'm 6'2'' and I can sit comfortably, very comfortably.  As for the ride, it's no less than heavenly for a light car.  It's just about as nice a ride as my mother's $50,000 BMW!  The trunk space is more than adequate, another plus.  I love the fact that I get about 34 m.p.g. overall. And about 38 m.p.g. on the highway.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who puts a lot of miles on a car.  The low gas and maintenance cost will bring a smile to any drivers face.  :o)<br><br>
