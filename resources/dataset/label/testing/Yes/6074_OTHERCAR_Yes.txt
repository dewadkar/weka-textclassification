            Just purchased our new Mercedes E320 sedan, our first MB. Options: truck CD changer; moonroof, etc; power rear sunshade. Disappointed in dealer prep-missing first-aid kit, paint damage, etc. Shouldn't have to pay extra for metallic paint on a $50,000+ car or a CD changer. Daytime running lights are not even an option and there is too much windnoise from the passenger door/window.
That said, the car is beautiful and attracts positive comments everywhere we go. Performance and handling is exceptional especially with comfortable ride and excellent gas mileage, 22+ city, 29+ highway, with less than 2,000 miles. Although everything works well, complex electronics made us decide on the additonal 4 year, 50k warranty at $2000+. Safety and reliability were our prime considerations and we certainly have not been disappointed.
Back seat passengers have commented on the space and comfort (they have a BMW 750i). Trunk is more than adequate, although a couple of large, hard-sided suitcases put it to the test.
A pleasure every time my wife or I get behind the wheel.
