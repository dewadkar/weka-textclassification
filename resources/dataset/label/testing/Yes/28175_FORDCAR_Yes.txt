              The '95 Ford Taurus, fairly ubiquitous in its heyday and for a good reason.  A very solid car, seats four comfortably, and five or six reasonably well.  The Taurus has excellent trunk space.  I owned an '89 Pontiac Bonneville prior to the Taurus, and the Taurus's trunk was a third again as big.  On a side note, when I got the 'new/used' Taurus, the most interesting thing to me, and the thing I showed off the most, was the amount of trunk space it had.  I'm talking two or three bodies in there, easyï¿½ not that I'd know. 

   Changing topics to things less likely to result in police investigation, the Taurus has great gas mileage.  I get 25-30 mpg in the city, and 30-35 (once even 40!) on the highway.  The engine is however, quite powerful, especially at that all-important 40-60 passing speed.  I was driving with my father in Ohio not long ago, when the situation came up that we had to pass an individual who had the coveted title of, "Stupidest person still capable of driving an automobile".  We elected to pass this buffoon, and using the Taurus's excellent acceleration, passed him easily.  My father and I exchanged glances, a look of appreciation for the Taurus's abilities passed between us.  All was right with the world.  The Taurus corners ok, not the best turning radius, but fairly good.  Her frame is also quite solid around the curves.  I've heard of some trouble with the transmission.  The only problem I've encountered is that there is some hesitation going from 1st to 2nd gear.  It's nothing terrible however.

   Comfortable for long rides, the creature comfort is pretty good.  The seats are quite comfortable, and accommodate a wide variety of human sizes, from 5' 6" 140 lbs (brother) to 6' 280 lbs (father).  I personally like the memory, volume, and seek buttons, which are located just to the right of the steering wheel, on the dash.  They are easy to access, and don't require you to look from the road.  The placement of the clock high on the dash is also appreciated for the same reason.  An interior complaint I have is the blasted cup holders.  Sized too small for most 20 oz bottles, and placed so that the dashboard overhangs it in such a way as to make it nigh impossible to get any drink out of it.  I think of it as a coffin for really small cups.

   In terms of fit and finish, the Taurus is well put together.  The trim and details look quite good, and as a whole I find the Taurus pleasing to the eye.  The only complaint I have in this department is the creakiness of the door handles and parts of the dash.  Sounding vaguely like a haunted house, the sound certainly detracts from the fit part of the car.  However, I should point out that the car is quite solid in these places, despite the creaking.

   Now to speak briefly of my car, rather than Taurus's in specific.  I purchased my car with 90,000 miles and a severely cracked windshield.  I've come to understand that '95 Taurus windshield can be quite expensive.  I had a family member do it, and it still cost about $500 dollars.  So add five to six hundred to the price of a 95 Taurus if you notice it has a cracked windshield.  I had some problems with electric door locks and gas cap covers, I don't know if this is common place, or unique but be sure to check them out before you buy.  Most of the parts in the car seem to be pretty long lasting, as the majority of the parts in my car are original (which is good, what with 90,000 miles in six years).  I moved cross country in this car, I had plenty of room for my stuff, had a comfortable ride, and got good gas mileage.  Bravo Ford.
