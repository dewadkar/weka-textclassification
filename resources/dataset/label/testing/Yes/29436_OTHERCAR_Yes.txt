            The Infinity Q45 is almost perfect, it competes with a few other Luxury sedans, and only one of them makes the Q fall short, the LS400.

When it comes to style, the Q45 is simply beautiful, elegant, classy, and yet somewhat sporty in a way.  It sports a 266HP engine, which is 24hp down from the LS400.  Many people seem to look away from buying a car from Infinity, and I disagree with their decision, and I will encourage you to look into purchasing the new Q45.

Engine, and Performance:  The car is smooth, and quiet, so quiet that you wouldnt notice excessive noise until you go beyond 95MPH, which i do all the time, and it still holds up.  Accelleration is more than needed for daily hour long commutes in highways where over-taking is nessasary for those people who drive constantly at 70.  The ride is smooth, yet sporty, it has a rather stiff suspension, which makes handling swift at higher speeds, heavy breaking is not nessasary while exiting the highway, turn as fast as you wish, as long as your driving skills can handle.

Audio Components: It has an 8 speaker 200 watt BOSE Stereo, great crisp sound for all kinds of music, very nice, you dont have to put it loud on the highway, thanks to the quiet ride.  And the stereo is available with a 6 CD changer, which I don't own, only because I did not think I would use the car too long to be able to complete cirtain CDs, and I was wrong, the stereo is so clear, and the car is so nice, you will want to sleep with it.  The quality of speakers is exelent, thumping bass and screeching treble.  The only thing Infinity might want to work on is the Head Unit, it is too plain, and needs to be spiced up, multi colored LCD displays, with maybe a more elegant stero, not just the ones you can find on your Maxima SE.

One thing I must emphisize, if you can afford, get the Touring Edition; the Infinity Q45T.   You get a sportier ride, with better looks.  Those rims are irristible, but this car would look great with some aftermarket 19s (drool).

The way you customise this car is up to you, but the car is perfect the way it is.  <br><br>
