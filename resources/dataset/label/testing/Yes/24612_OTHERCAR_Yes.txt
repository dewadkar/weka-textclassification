            I recently went to a dealership to trade in my moms 1992 Ford Taurus.  I was unhappy with the transmission problems the Taurus gave.  I wanted to get a car that would be reliable for my mom.  
I decided to trade in for a 1993 Oldmobile Cutlass Ciera S.  I was happy to see a nice car with only 28,000 miles on the odometer.  The Ciera S is a reliable and predictable car.  Sure it's not popular with the younger generation, but for the money, you get a solid car.
Right now, I am bringing the cars routine maintenance schedule up to date so it will run like new again.  I believe that routine maintenance is the key to making your car last a long time.  Don't let any mechanic tell you that you should slack off on maintaining your vehicle.  It will only cause problems down the road that no-one looks forward to.  Trust me on this, I have owned many cars and trucks and slacking on upkeep is a recipe for disaster!

I can't understand why Oldsmobile stopped making this wonderful automobile!  It is reliable and comfortable.  The ride is nice and quite.  The 3.3L V6 engine has plenty of power for city and highway driving.  The gas mileage is outstanding for a V6 of this size.

Maybe Oldsmobile found out that they made a vehicle 'too' reliable, and decided it wouldn't be profitable to keep in production.
Well, In my opinion, Oldsmobile made a fine automobile.  I recommend this car to anyone needing a good solid ride.
