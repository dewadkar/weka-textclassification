            If you ever run across a 1967 Cadillac Deville..You better crab it!
My father has had his for almost 13 years now..It is in mint condition..with 56,000 miles and has a 429 engine..

This car would start up on the coldest day of the year..It could even out run the newest car on the block...

In the 13 years he has owned this car, He has had to do less work on it than I have had to do with every car I have ever owned!

Cadillac's are one of the best cars ever made,they are dependable,fare priced,and as my father would say THEY WILL LAST A LIFE TIME.

Cadillac's are a good car for the whole family...or the perfect gift   for that person that already has everything!

When you buy a Cadillac you are buying style and A piece of mine that will last forever.. <br><br>
