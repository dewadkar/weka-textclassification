            I recently bought a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  I love this car!   I bought the Eclipse over the VW Jetta because of the sporty look, the price, and the over all performance.  I am 16 years old and bought my own Eclipse and the prices are great.  You get a great quality car for a decent and practical amount of money.  As a somewhat unexperienced driver i feel comfortable in my eclipse because it is reliable.  The only disadvantage to this car is it is a sports car, therefor it is lower to the ground and massive amounts of snow can be a problem as it is to all cars.  Driving my eclipse is like driving a hoover craft, it is a smooth ride and it is very comfortable.  A person with an outgoing personality should buy this car; it gets high amounts of attention due to its beauty.  But, it is not a family car and i would not advise getting it as a family car if you have a young child or a large family.<br><br>
