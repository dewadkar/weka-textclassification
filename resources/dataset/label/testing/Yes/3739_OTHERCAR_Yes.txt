            I tried out the major names in full size trucks. My truck is used for work and personal use, but not for heavy duty usage so i'll stick with the 1500 series.The Ford F-150 was nicwe but the suspention left little to be desired, you felt every bump in the road and the steering was not as tight and responsive as you would like in a truck.  I also tested the Dodge Ram 1500, boy have they changed in the past two years.  The ride was good but the interior was excellent, loaded with all the gadgets you could want (especially the seat warmer.  Even with all this, the Ram was a little pricey even for me.  The last test was the Chevy Silverado C1500, By far the best ride.  GM has always had the best ride in trucks over the past few years.  The interior was roomy and options were plentiful (not as many as the Ram) with what I was looking for.  What I ended up buying is a Chevy Silverado C1500 w/vortex chip(Power chip that makes a difference), leather interior, AM/FM Cassette w/CD player, dual exhaust (a must if you drive alot), and a few other small options.  2000 model runs around 33,400 but wheeling and dealing, I got it for 27,650 if your into 4X4 the Z-71 Off Road package loaded can be had for right at 30K.  By far if you are looking for a good riding (especially long hauls), smooth handling work/personal full size truck the Chevy Silverado C1500 is the best buy for your hard earned buck.<br><br>
