            I spent a while looking at digital cameras before I settled on this one. But boy am I glad I did...

This camera is very straight forward and a great jumping off point into the world of digital cameras. It is incredibly easy to use, even my mom can do it! 

It comes with a great DVD that explains everything you need to know about how to use it. Its great to have some random actor guy explain to you how to take a picture than having to sit down and read a manual.

The software that comes with this camera is also great. Software is an important part of buying a digital camera because it really can make or break your experience with the pictures.

I love this camera because I can just throw it in my purse and go out with friends, not having to worry about how much film I have or stuff that comes along with a non-digital camera.

The drawbacks with this camera include two things which can be fixed if one wants to invest in the money. The battery pack that the camera comes with doesn't seem to last that long. I had to recharge it several times during Christmas day. If this is really annoying you can by a longer lasting battery or the AC adapter pack. The camera comes with a memory card that way too small for anyone who actually wants to use this camera without having a computer attached to their head so they can upload their pictures after taking each one. I recommend a 128 size compact flash, you can take over 200 pictures with it! This is great for going on a vacation or a trip where you don't have access to a computer to upload your pictures too.
