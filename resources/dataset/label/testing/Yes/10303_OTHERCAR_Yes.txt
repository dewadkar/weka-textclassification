            I purchased this car used with 30,000 miles on it.  The car has 112,000 miles on it now so I can give an opinion from time and experience.

The Altima is very well made.  The drive train performs well with little upkeep required.  The only things I've had done to it are as follows:
    1. Air conditioner compressor replaced. (105,000)
       Air conditioner belt bearings replaced (55,000)
       CV joints on both front side replaced (108,000)
       Normal break work (pads replaced about each 30,000)

The car is fine, but with the personality of mud.  It is a rolling bubble which I cannot find when I park it in a shopping mall parking lot because it looks like every other car at the mall.

The gas mileage ranges from about 23 in town to 26 on the road.  It handles well but on a long trip it gets a little small.

Overall, it is an excellent car.  I do wish the Japanese would learn to make pretty cars rather than bland ones.  <br><br>
