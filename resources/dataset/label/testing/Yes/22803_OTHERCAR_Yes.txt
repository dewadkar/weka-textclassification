            I bought this vehicle because at the time it was very 
affordable... Now let me tell you a few things... First
of all, this is my second Hyundai Accent... Now with 
both of my Accents I have put at least 40,000 miles on 
each and I have never had a problem with either... The 
only thing that I wish I would of done is to get a more
sporty package than I did... I am a teenager and in 
this time frame and many generations back, we (teenagers)
have always wanted a more faster, sportier cars.... 
And I also wish that the accents had more power to get 
hills. My car always has a problem maintaining its 
speed on hills. It is like my engine has hamsters instead
of cylinders running!!!!!!
Now with the driving ability of the car, well it is very
easy to handle except when you are in winds of over 15mph..
When this happens the car is very hard to handle in the 
ways of steering it.... But all in all the handling is 
great and the ride is very smooth.....

Now I would suggest this as a perfect car for beginners.
It is a very affordable car and it gets great mileage..
I personally get 32 miles per gal in the city and 36
miles per gallon on the interstate... And the vehicle
doesn't take much to fill the gas tank... I believe that
it has a 10.9 gallon tank on it.  So if you are a first 
or maybe a second time buyer, This car would be a great
investment, especially with the new 50,000 bumper to 
bumper warranty, and the 100,000 mile powertrain warranty.
Well I hope that this helped you out with any questions
that you might of had and I thank you for reading my 
opinion....
