            In May 1993, I purchased my first new car, a 1993 SATURN SL1 4 DOOR SEDAN.  I was so excited to own my first new car, and with a new baby was reassured to have a reliable car.  My father is a mechanical engineer and assured me that this was a safe car and a good value.  Now, that my Saturn has been killed, I can look back and evaluate the years we had together.

I paid $13275 plus tax, title and license for this car.  I had an automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, power windows, power locks, etc.  It was just short of being loaded with all the features.  I did not purchase the extended warranty on this car.  The one that came with the car at this time was 3 years and 36,000 miles.

The first few years were great.  The warranty on this car is superb.  I did have a problem with the alternator going out on my way home from the airport one day, but the customer service line had a tow truck to me in 15 minutes.  The dealership had the problem fixed the next day and gave me a coupon for a free ice cream because of my inconvenience.  

During the second year, I found out just how dedicated to customer service these "Saturn people" are.  I had driven to the beach with my daughter and a friend, and inadvertently locked my keys in the car.  I didn't know what to do since I didn't have an auto club membership, and home was 75 miles away to get the spare key.  I figured I would call and see if they would help.  The customer service team said that although it was not covered under the warranty, they would send someone out at no charge.  15 minutes later, a tow truck pulled up and got my keys out for me.  I told him I couldn't believe how quickly he responded.  He told me that Saturn has an excellent auto club membership that was the same as Mercedes.

The repairs necessary for this car were minor maintenance items.  My one complaint is that my particular car was tough on alternators.  I must have gone through 3 or 4 in the life of my car.  At least all but one was covered under warranty.   

I highly recommend this car for anyone who looking at it.  It was a great car.  Recently I noticed it was beginning to grow smaller as the number of children you placed inside increased.  I guess that is just what happens over the course of 8 years and 98,000 miles.

Now on to the death of my Saturn.  As I was driving through an intersection, someone (in a 1994 Honda Civic) decided to run the red light and plow into the side of my Saturn.  This sent my car spinning about 210 degrees.  Luckily, when I saw him coming, I sped up a little and was able to change the point of impact slightly.  I was hit at a high rate of speed square in the middle of the rear driver side wheel.  I (eight months pregnant) was in the driver seat.  My daughter (almost 8 years old) was sitting in the rear seat on the driver side (asleep) with her head leaning up against the door.  I knew that Saturn had a lot of safety features, but I didn't realize I would be testing them.  The airbag did not deploy.  I have been told that it is designed to deploy only in head and rear impact collisions.  My first thought when the car stopped spinning was that I was amazed that I was still sitting comfortably in the driver's seat.  My neck and back hurt a little, but I appeared unscathed.  My daughter was bleeding from a 3-inch laceration to her forehead.  It is uncertain where this came from, but it is not believed it is where she was leaning up against the door that did receive a portion of the direct impact.  I was eight months pregnant at the time, and was immediately concerned about going into labor.  I did go into preterm labor eventually, but the doctor stopped the labor and everything turned out ok with minimal intervention.  Since then, I have looked at my Saturn to survey the damage.  The car is totalled because of it's current value.  The frame is bent, the rear door is a total loss.  The rear quarter panel is broken in pieces, and the trunk caved in.  I could see the gas tank, but it looked unharmed.  I truly believe that for as hard as I was hit in the accident, it is amazing that endured such minimal injuries.  

I am sorry to see the death of my Saturn, and I would buy another one all over again.  It is time to hit the Saturn dealer again and have him find me a replacement.
