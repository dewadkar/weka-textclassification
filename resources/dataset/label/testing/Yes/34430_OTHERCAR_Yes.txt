            I used to own a 93SL I bought used. It had 259K miles before it blew up.  I was enthusiastic about getting an SC2 for my very first new car. The styling is great, the steering feel and suspension is nice.  I decided to purchase this rather than wait for the ION sedan.  I took the showroom vehicle which includes power everything and leather, also an extended warranty.  After 1 year and 20,000 miles I can say I still really love the sporty look, dent resistance, 3rd door and safety design and features.

The safety design and features I mention in particular  because  I have just gotten into a minor (20mph) front end collision. I can say the car crumples nicely.  The airbags are such that they know whether to deploy or not(sensors). Mine didn't and so I didn't have to get those replaced.  I only needed the seat belts which held me in place.  The hood, front bumper and light assemblies are being replaced at the body shop.  No mechanical damage that I know of but I'll have Saturn check it when I get it back. 

Having been thru this I now notice even for a good condition car, Its value is half what I signed my loan for. My car will be worth even less given the accident. Serious negative equity, so I'm pretty much stuck if I were wanting to trade the car for something else anywhere. The engine should've been peppier- it didn't bother me until I drove a corolla ce for a rental vehicle and noticed.  The engine in the Sports Coupe seems too similar to the sedan I had, and thought it would be detectably better.  Well, I just hope it will be as reliable. So far only had a seal replaced under warranty.
The seats are still the same as in the sedan- not comfortable on lengthy trips.  I have leather which seems to help a bit.
