            I recently bought a Polaroid PDC300 over the internet through ebay.  I chose this camera because I had scoured the net, and found good reports about this product and it had a price I could afford. The camera itself is great.  It comes with easy to understand instructions and is very easy to use.  I am happy with the picture quality.  It can work on AA batteries or a plug-in cord and comes with a carrying case.  I do find it uses up the batteries very quickly about after only taking 4 pictures, so try to use the cord whenever possible.  I do recommend this camera.  The only reservation I have is that the camera comes with photomax software, but however, the company does not include a booklet to explain how to use it anymore(the box states there are instructions).  On calling Polaroid  I was told to consult the help files because they do not give out the booklets anymore, which always turns out to be useless, annoying, and time-consuming. How can a user ask for help on a category when they are unfamiliar with the software and don't know the &quot;right question&quot; to ask? For those of you who have ever tried using &quot;help&quot; files, you know what I mean.  I tried and got nowhere. I called the company for a booklet and was told they do not offer it anymore (I even offered to pay for it), nor do they offer instructions which the user can download from their web site. Polaroid's only answer to me was to use the help file.  I had to make several persistent calls to Polaroid before they finally &quot;found&quot; an instruction booklet hanging around.  With that problem taken care of,  I am very happy with the product!!<br><br>
