            Have had this Camera for around a year now, and am still pleased with it's performance considering the price. I originally paid $70 or so plus shipping on Ebay, but it can now be found well under $50. Useful only in 640x480(Fine) Mode, the Normal 320x240 Mode is all but useless. Figure on an average of 10-12 pics on the included 2MB Memory Card, the 4MB Cards double that though they're not cheap at $25, but I bought 2 which gives me about as much capacity as a 36exp 35mm roll. Batteries (Lithium C-123A) are pricey too at $8-$10 retail but can be found on the web as low as $2.50ea. so order a 1/2Dozen plus shipping for under $25 and its not too bad. Definitely get the AC adapter for another $10 for downloading your pics and save the batts. The Software supplied isn't too bad but I've found that I have to use it, for some reason the camera refuses to download with any of my other graphics programs on my Home computer or my Laptop.

The pics the Relysis Dimera 3500 takes are usually good enough for my purposes, web sites and e-mail but obviously not enough resolution for printing actual photo quality. But this is about all you can get for this price range from any vendor.

Unfortunately the Major Manufacturers STILL haven't gotten any really good Digital Cameras under $200 and it seems that they want to keep their decent entry level models closer to $300. Sorry, I just can't/don't want to spend that amount of cash even though I would like a 1 Megapixel or better unit to work with. For the really Important pics I still use an old Fuji Discovery 35mm and my 3yr old scanner thank you very much.
