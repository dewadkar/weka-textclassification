            I Love my Jeep Cherokee Classic.  I went to a new car show and compared prices.  It was obvious to me that I was getting the most for my money with the Cherokee.  I was looking for a utility vehicle because I seemed to be doing more and more hauling of groceries, parts for my husband and kids.  I needed space.  I got loads of space with my Jeep.  It has great head room, leg room and with the fold down back seat I can haul so much.  My husband thought I should get a pickup, but I didn't like the idea that whatever I put in the back would be exposed to the elements, and theft.  The Jeep has a cover that pulls over my packages so anyone looking in the window couldn't see what was inside.  It doesn't get the gas mileage I got with a car, but still isn't bad on the freeway.  It rides well and at 3 years and 52,000 miles just got a new battery and a power steering pump.  The first time it's been in the shop.  It was a great value, and still looks new.  It has been low maintenance, reliable, dependable and I haven't had any trouble with the dealer.  I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a utility vehicle, and if you haven't considered a utility vehicle, maybe you should.
Thanks.
