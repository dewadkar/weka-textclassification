            <b>OVERVIEW</b>

My wife and I recently had our second child, and as part of the preparation we had to look into upsizing our vehicle to allow for two child restraint systems.  As you can tell by looking through my reviews, my wife and I have owned quite a few vehicles, and at that time we had a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and a Honda Accord, 1997 EX.  I drive the accord back and forth to work, while my wife was driving the Jeep.  The Jeep was great, but considering that we both have a one-way 55 mile drive, we wanted something a little bit cheaper on gas and roomier, as two child seats do not fit comfortably in the back seat.  Read on for my impressions...

<b>Comparison Shopping 101</b>

My wife and I now live in the wilds of Omaha, Nebraska.  The roads are not too bad and the need for four wheel drive is non-existent.  We no longer feel the need for high end vehicles, although the Jeep that we were trading in was very, very nice.

As such, we were looking for something that would drop our car payment approximately $100/month and reduce our gasoline usage.  Considering the trade in was a Jeep Grand Cherokee, we found that unless we went for a brand new, highest end minivan, we were going to be able to accomplish both goals quite easily.

We began by reviewing minivan reviews on the epinions.com site.  From this, as well as our own personal feelings on how the vehicles looked, we pared the field down to three potential purchases; the <b>Honda Odyssey</b>, the <b>Toyota Sienna</b>, and the <b>Chrysler Town and Country</b>.  We already knew that by looks and quality we did not want either a Ford or GM product(at least not minivan) and by safety we did not feel comfortable with the Saturn, Kia, or Mazda models.  

<b>Off we go!</b>

We set off one beautiful day promising each other that we would test drive each of the three choices before we made a decision.  The first place we stopped was a Chrysler, Ford, Chevy and Jeep dealer just south of the metro.  We immediately went to the Chrysler dealer and asked to test drive a 2002 Chrysler Town and Country, of which they had several.  

Before taking us out to test drive one, the dealer sat us down and asked what we were looking for.  After explaining our two goals, he showed us to a 2001 T & C that they had just received back from the auction with 17,000 miles on it.  It was LX model and maroon, which is a very nice looking color.  We took it for a test drive and liked what we saw.  Rather than buying it outright, we went to try out the Honda and Toyota, just as we promised.  I will get back to what I specifically liked about the T & C later in the review.

<b>Honda Odyssey</b>

We drove the Jeep into town and stopped at the Honda dealer.  We asked to test drive a 2002 Odyssey, at which point the salesman laughed.  He really laughed!  He told us that the Odyssey was so popular that they had a shortage nationwide and that people were putting their names in three months in advance for the vehicles.  We could test drive a 2001 that the owner personally owned and then put our name down for a 2002, which may or may not show up in three months.(well after the baby would be born)

We decided to stick to our promise and drive the 2001 Odyssey.  The vehicle handled very nicely and had nice looking interior materials.  The Honda stereo in the 2001 was very powerful and clean, which is important to me and not so much to my wife.  The engine was somewhat underpowered and did not 'get up and go' like I would have hoped, but then it really is an oversized Honda Accord, with little thought as to how a minivan should differ from an accord.  

The interior was very nice, except that the second row of seats was somewhat smaller than those in the T & C.  This means that if we put our 18 month old in his chair and the new baby in his chair in the same row, we would have mayhem all the way to work and back as the 18 month old incessantly picked prodded and poked the newborn.  This, along with the underpowered feel and the 'carlike' ride make us start thinking that the Honda was not right for us.  

The fact that we would have to wait three months was also obviously a detractor for the deal.  We needed something that we could have when the new baby was born, and not something that shortly after the baby was born we had to go down and run through the gauntlet of trying to finance a new car.  If we were buying a minivan for ourselves with no children, this would probably have been our choice.  Our needs were different.

<b>Toyota Sienna</b>

From the minute we rolled into the Toyota dealer we were unimpressed with the Sienna.  We did not like the styling of the body, nor did we like the feel of the seats.  The driver and passenger seat, which is where most car makers will spend money to make it comfortable, were no where near the comfort of the Honda and the T & C.  The front windshield was much more sloped and made for the same type of feel that I had when in my parents old Pontiac minivan of the late 80's.  On top of all this, the engine was not extremely powerful, and the second row of seats was only available in captain's chairs, which are not ideal at all for child's seats.

<b>Back to the T & C</B>

After doing our promised comparison shopping, we went back and once again drove the Town and Country to ensure that it was really what we wanted.  We liked the feel of the drive, the seats and even checked out the back seats for comfort.  They are also very nice for long trips!  We then asked what the price difference would be to move up to a 2002, and the answer was almost $125/month.  

Also, we would lose the bench seats with the <b>built in childs restraint system</b> and have to go with captain's chairs, similar to the Toyota!  Why do car manufacturer's do this?  Parents are the bread and butter of the minivan dealer, many of which have small children.  The built in restraints are wonderful and should be required, in my opinion. 

We did not care to have the automatic sliding doors and rear hatch, so much of the benefits to upgrading to a 2002 were moot points for us.  If we were much older and/or were carting around my grandmother, as my mom currently does, we would probably have thought twice about this, as these doors are very heavy for an elderly person to open by themselves.

Finally, since the dealer was a Jeep dealer as well, we got the best trade in at the Chrysler dealer.  I guess you can tell that we bought the Town and Country, and that we have kept it ever since.  

<b>Downsides after driving</b>

Honestly, there are not a whole lot of downsides to this that I would change.  There are a few, and in no particular order, they are:

Rear seats do not have tilt control and thus the baby carrier that we do use puts the child at a somewhat odd angle.  I would definitely pay more for the tilt control, as it would make my baby's sleep in the vehicle much easier and quicker.  As I said, we have a 55 mile, one way drive to work, so it is important to us that the baby is comfortable and can sleep.

Handling is not 'sporty'.  When/if you take corners at a mid-speed, you will hear about it from your tires.  I thought this was a function of the tires, so I changed them out.  It is not a function of the tires, as both old and new tires squeel around the corners at what I would consider not very high rates of speed.  It is more a function of the top heavy nature of the minivan.  I did not notice this out of the Honda or the Toyota, but then I also did not notice the pep in the engine that I have in the T & C.

Rear air option is half-hearted, at best.  This was a very big selling point to us as I remember hot, sweaty trips in the back seat of my parents vehicle while they were riding in comfort with the A/C.  There is a separate unit for the rear seats, but it is not very powerful for the area that it needs to cool.  Add several hot bodies and it does not keep up well at all.

Rear seat needs to fold into floor.  The Honda had this, and I do not think that the Sienna did, but I could be wrong.  This is the wave of the future, and I think it is time for Chrysler to jump on board.  The seat is not hard for myself to get out, but once again if an older individual were to purchase this vehicle, they would have a heck of a time getting it in and out. 

That's it!  If any of the negatives I have listed are big items for you, I would suggest comparison shopping prior to deciding what to buy.  If not, I would highly recommend the Town and Country.  It is made by the people who know minivans the best, and as such is a high quality vehicle.
