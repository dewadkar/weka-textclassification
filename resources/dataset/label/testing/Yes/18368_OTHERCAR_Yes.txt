            With a growing family, I realized the need for a mini-van.  I started by test driving Dodge, Chevrolet, Ford and Chrysler.  They were all just ok.  Then I test drove the Mercury Villager and was very impressed with the ride.  It is very smooth and car-like.  The van came with a standard V6 and the price was right.  I was interested in a lease and all of the other vans were around $500 a month (I was looking at vans with V6, air, power doors and locks), the Villager was over $100 less and had everything that I wanted.  We have had the van for six months now and I love it.  It is convenient, sharp looking and a smooth ride.<br><br>
