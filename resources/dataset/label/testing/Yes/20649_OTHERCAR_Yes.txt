            The Audi A6 is a truly great car, but very similar to he Volkswagen Passat. I rode in the A6 2.8; this V6 engine provides more than enough power. Out of stoplights, we accelerated to cruising speed in no time. The one problem with the interior is the back seat. The middle seat offers almost no legroom. There is a huge bump in the middle of the bench, much bigger than most other cars. There aren't many other problems with the car. The front seats are huge, very comfortable, and move to accommodate any sort of passenger. The controls are large and easy to read. The speedometer display is very bold, and there are two red lights in the ceiling center console, which make it easy to read things and see what you're doing in the cockpit, but the lights don't mess with night vision. These lights are around the cabin, and help with night time visibility.

I have been in a 2.8 liter A6, and a 1.9 TDI. The TDI isn't sold in the states, but is similar to the 1.8T engine in the A4 and Passat. I didn't notice much power difference in these engines. The 1.9 TDI is more powerful than I would have ever expected.

The A6 is a great highway car also. Cruising at 85-90 m.p.h. is no problem, and the engine doesn't sound overworked to the least. The cabin remained quiet, and felt very solid. The suspension and road holding power are very strong, and around curved roads, the A6 still felt very solid.

What most people don't know is that this car is built on the same platform as the A4 and the Passat. The Passat is not considered a luxury car, but it is very similar to the A6. It comes with the same 2.8 liter engine and is just as roomy on the inside. But, the Passat is much cheaper. Personally, I think that the Passat is a much better looking car too. It comes with optional leather just like the A6. Volkswagen uses the same platform and engine, for both cars, meaning they aren't very different. Anyone looking at the A6 should consider the Passat, since it is cheaper and offers many of the same basic features.
