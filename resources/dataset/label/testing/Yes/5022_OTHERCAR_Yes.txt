            I am a professional photographer and trainer for Sears Portrait Studio's.  During my travels this summer as a District Training Manager, I decided that a digital would serve many purposes for training benefits of how to effectively set up a studio that may not be up to par.  So, went the venture for a digital.  At the motel one evening on QVC, they just happened to be talking about the Ricoh 6000.  The price seemed reasonable, the clarity and ease looked good, and what the heck, there was a 30 day no hassle guaranty.  Hence, I ordered the camera.  It arrived when I was out of town and didn't take it back on the road for about a week.  Took the camera out, fully charged it, and started playing with it in the motel.  Took the camera  out with me  to photograph some tables and items that needed replacing.  I was amazed at the ease and the quality of the photographs.  If you take the time to go through the book, step by step, and not just dive in as if you knew everything there is to know, then this will be a good first digital camera.  I have since showed it to many friends.  I have used the camera in a very low light situation, and when I thought I might need a flash, and actually didn't.
I have used other friends digital camera's in the past, and I believe that this is a good user friendly camera for a  person just starting out.
The camera came with several add-ons, and extra paraphenalia for downloading on to the net to print out 4x6 portraits that are just like the ones you go get developed in the store.  It's a great product.  The JPEG, and color quality are superior.
