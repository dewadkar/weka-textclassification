            I fist began looking into getting a digital camera around six months ago.  It was at this time that I started hearing about HP's plans to relase a new line of cameras, with the 812 as their flagship model.  I did my best to research this camera and eventually got one.  I'm not entirely new to digital camera technology, but this is the first digicam I've owned.
I immediately noticed how small this unit is.  HP's sized it down by using two methods.  First, they have dropped the number of AA size batteries in this unit to two from four.  Second, they've replaced the bulky Compact Flash memory card with a Secure Digital card.  Both moves have sized this model down considerably in comparison to some of HP's previous monsters.  As expected, the reduction of usable batteries from four to two has impacted on the life expectancy of batteries in this unit, but it hasn't been as detrimental as expected.  From what I understand, HP's running some sort of capacitor system inside the camera that balances power from the batteries, helping to extend their life.  The SD card was a nice addition, as these cards are much smaller and have the option of locking them, preventing images being deleted accidentally.  Unfortunately, SD cards cost a bit more than CF cards (about 15% more) but this should come more in line as the card gains popularity.
The HP Instant Share software in the camrera allows pictures to be marked and sent to a number of destinations, including email addresses or your printer when you link your camera to your computer.  It's a nice feature and takes one more step out of the process of handling your pictures.
The zoom is excellent on this model (3X optical, 7X digital), with the full 21X zoom still producing decent photos.  The zoom lens does make a bit of noise when the camera is turned on or the zoom is used, but it is only noticeable in a very quiet room.
With other features like red-eye reduction flash, timed shutter, easily navigable menus, 60 second video clip recording and the option to record 30 seconds of audio with every picture, the robust features on this camera make it a worthwhile purchase.
An extra word of praise for this camera that you won't find on HP's website is how well it handles being abused.  This camera's been dropped a few times (once from a height of three feet onto pavement), been turned on in a shirt pocket (the zoom lens extends when the unit is powered up, so clearance is necessary), and has an almost permanent home in my jacket pocket.  Through it all, the camera has managed to withstand all the abuse and has only a few scratches and dings to show for it.
This camera is definitely worth a look.
