            If iit is a small suv that you are looking for then you have looked in the right direction. The X-90 has a very sport two door/seat design that is actually incredibly roomy compared to what it looks like on the outside. I think during many tight situations that the 4 wheel drive has come in very handy as this car performs well in the snow while using it. There is plenty of ground clearance in this car so if you would like to do some mild off road use it is a feasable option. The only trouble i have had with mine is that it doesn't accelerate very well, and after some time in extreme temperatures the windows become a little slow. As for the stereos in these little bad boys, they come equipped with alpine systems which have incredible sound. When it comes down to it, who needs to drive a vehicle the size of a small building anyways? I think if you are into small vehicles yet you want the versatility of an suv this is for you.
