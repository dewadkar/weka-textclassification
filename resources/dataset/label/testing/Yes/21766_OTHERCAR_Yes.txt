            The Honda Civic is a tough little car.  The leg room in front is ample, even for a six footer.  Seats were very comfortable and reclined.  Trunk space was fairly adequate.  The car has a lot of get up and go.  The one I owned was a five speed.  Everything on the car was solid.  The drive on the highway was fairly quiet and controllable, even for a compact.  The car is very aerodynamic.  One drawback to the Civic is that it sits very low on road.  Sometimes in deep snow it would not clear.  And, the back seat headroom is limited.  Resale value is excellent.  These cars are very much in demand.  I would recommend the Honda Civic.  But, it is much more geared for a single person, or as a second car.  I wish I could have afforded to keep it for my daughter's sixteenth birthday.  This is a very reliable vehicle.<br><br>
