            I own a 1995 Camry Coupe. The coupe is basically the same as the common 4-door version except the door of course and the front seats have more legroom (important for me since I am 6'7&quot;). On that note the coupe and 4-door model are comfortable for taller people. I have owned my Camry since June of 1997. After owning the reliability plagued Ford Bronco the Camry was been a joy. It is extremely reliable! I have never had anything significant go wrong with it. If you keep the Camry oiled and lubed and get all the scheduled maintenance it will go forever. 

The ride is nice and smooth and quiet. The trunk is roomy for a mid sized car. The back seats are cramped for anyone over 6' especially the coupe version. It has a nice little bin in between the front seats for storing random stuff. The seats are comfortable but shorter people, I have found them a bit uncomfortable after a long drive (5-6 hours). The headroom is good even in the back seats. Both the automatic and manual transmissions shift nicely (I have the manual, which is rare). The cup holder is too low and gets pokes the right leg. The cup holder only holds pop can size cups. The stock stereo system is nice. The spare tire is in the trunk and easy to get to. My 95 Camry has dual air bags, which is standard on the 95-year models. I assume every 95 Camry to the present ones have dual airbags; I don't know what year they started dual airbags. 

I personally like the look and style of the 92-96 Camry, the coupe looks especially sharp. 

The 4 cylinder is a bit underpowered on hills, especially if you have passengers on board. I assume the V6 model has plenty power, I have never driven the V6 model. 

You will pay more for a Camry over the American cars but there is good reason for that. It is worth paying more. Overall the Camry is an excellent car for a single person or small family! You can't go wrong!
