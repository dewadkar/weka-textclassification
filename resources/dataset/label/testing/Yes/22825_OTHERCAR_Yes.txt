            I bought my Alero (4 door) in December using ALL of the discounts, so I couldn't pass up the deal!  Being my first new car, I am impressed by dumb things (no duct tape or wire coats hangs, haha).  So far so good.  

It was in the shop immediately after purchase because the dome light wasn't wired properly, it would never turn off if in the "door" position.  Other than that, the Alero is a stable ride with great gas mileage, comparable to my old Saturn.  My biggest complaint also resides with the trunk lid.  Make sure you keep your snow scrapper in the back seat so you can dust ALL the snow off of the rear of the car before opening the trunk.  

Other than that, it is very easy to drive, park and not that cramped in the back seat for shorter trips (my dog enjoys the entire back seat for his sprawling pleasure). It picks up speed well (without using much gas) and handles nicely.  I like the cruise control on the steering wheel and all other functions (radio, cd, heat, a/c) are all within an easy reach.  The speedometer, gas gage, etc are large and well displayed for easy reading.

While this is the same chassis of the Grand Am, I didn't want the "sporty" look, rather a simpler, plain jane, sleeker car and the Alero is one of them.
