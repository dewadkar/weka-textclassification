            I purchased a black Pontiac Grand Am GT on October 3, 1999. So far I would have to say it is the best car. I previously owned a 1997 Cavalier, which I see a lot of people posting opinions in this category used to own also. I loved that car, but it was in 3 accidents and it was not fast enough for me. After looking at Alero's, Jeeps, etc. my mother and father mentioned the Grand Am. I myself was thinking of the older version of the Grand Am and the first thing I said was no, but my mother made me look at one and I fell in love. It's fast, It looks great and it's not too expensive. I have only owned this vehicle for 4 months, so I can't say that I am not going to have any problems with it, but so far, so good!! 
When the warranty is up, I am going to add a speed chip and the flow master. My mother has the flow master on her 93 Z28 Camaro!! Talk about AWESOME!! I can't wait.

Update!
Have now had this car for 4 years and would have to say it was the best buy for me. I have only had normal minor problems with it that the warranty took care off. It still drives like a champ! I moved to Los Angeles and would have to say the one thing that hurt my pocket book was the cost of gas. Due to the fact that the Grand AM GT is a V6 engine, it eats gas. A word for the wise, if you don't want to spend a lot on gas, I would not get this car, but if you don't mind spending a little more money just to have this hot looking car with all that speed, GO FOR IT!
