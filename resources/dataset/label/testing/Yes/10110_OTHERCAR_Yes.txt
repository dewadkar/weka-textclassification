            I purchased this vehicle for several reasons.  First, it's just flat-out good looking.  Second, it is very roomy, just be careful to lower your head getting in back.  Third, considering the option level and quality it was a steal. When you step on the gas, it goes.  When you step on the brakes it stops.  My Sable is equipped with the Duratec V6 and 4 wheel disk brakes.  The brakes have virtually no vibration, fade or any peculiar noises under the hood.  

I have experienced a number of unusual problems.  At around 30,000 the windshield washer stopped washing.  Not too long after that, the car would not go into gear due to an electric reverse device going out.  After making that repair, the cruise control stopped working.  The original Motorcraft battery recently died at 58,000, but now the anti-theft keys do not work and I can not start the car.  The column shift center console broke from leaning on it.  I only weight 160 lbs.  The driver seat creaks when I sit in it.

All in all, I love this car.  My hope is that Mercury has worked out some of these bugs in subsequent models.<br><br>
