            I own a Dodge Durango and absolutely love it!I had a Chevy Suburban before
I bought the dodge.The suburban was too big for me but I still wanted that third seat option and also wanted something that wasn't so boxed looking.Believe it or not my dodge even rides smoother,even with it being 
four wheel drive.We also wanted something that would be able to pull our 30ft. travel trailer,the dodge does this without hesitation.I've owned my dodge not for 2 years and have been totally pleased so far.The only bad thing I can say for this vehicle is it eats gas.It does not get the mpg's that it had promised.I knew it would drink alot of gas,having the 360 engine in it,but I expected it to be a little closer to what the sticker said.Still all and all(so far)I'm pleased with it and in my opinion,there is not sharper looking SUV on the market.<br><br>
