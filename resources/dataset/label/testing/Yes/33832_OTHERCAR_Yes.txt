            Look & Feel
The look of the Range Rover Classic is well thought out and practical.  Everything is within a good reaching distance and the classic look of the vehicle draws many stares and promps many conversations from other motorists.  The seats are all leather and spacious.  My LWB model has the biggest back-seats I have ever seen, able to seat my tallest friends without a problem.  The controls are all well made, easy to read and find.  Getting in and out of the vehicle is easy enough even for my 5' 3" wife.  

The Ride
My LWB drives like a dream.  It floats along comfortably and has no problem blowing right past other SUV's when your in the mood.  The vehicle is very stable and is centered well - I am able to corner at higher speeds without the feeling that I am about to tip over.  Also, I have been told by passengers that the ride feels very level when maneuvering unlike other trucks that bounce your passengers around on corners.  The engine is responsive and powerful and makes quick work of the steep hills of San Francisco.

The Gas Mileage
I am currently giving my LWB Medium grade gasoline (cheveron only) and it seems very happy with it.  Regardless of my driving habits, I seem to get 16mpg or around 230 miles per tank.

Vehicle Cost
The Classic Range Rovers is the best deal around.  I bought mine in excellent condition with 60,000 miles on it for $12,000.  

Repairs
Parts are expensive so be sure you get one that has been well taken care of.  The air Suspension in Classic Range Rover is prone to failure and is very expensive to fix or replace with coil.  Replacing the entire suspension with coil will run around $1,200 and replacing all parts of your air suspension can cost upwards of $4,000.  Most mechanics and enthusiasts encourage the coil conversion for added comfort and increased dependability.  

Off-Road
I have an older Land Rover for my off-roading but the Range Rover Classic is a great off-road vehicle.  The LWB models will probably not be a top pick since they are so long and can get you into problems.  Small modifications will make any Classic Rangie into a monster off-road.
