            I got the '98 SLK 230 about 2 months ago and I love it. I got it used from a guy on long island for about 23500 and he kept his in great condition. Its silver with black leather interior. The acceleration of the car is great and its really quiet as you drive around. Its small, compact and very quick. But the bad parts about it are that you need hi-test gasoline, its a V4 which makes it a little bit slower than other cars, and the add-ons like a cd-player can be expensive.

I think the coolest aspect of the car is that its a hard-top retractable convertible. You have no idea how many times I have put the top down and up, and have had no problems. The overall process from changing from a hard-top to convertible takes less than 30 seconds. It takes the same time to go from convertible to hard-top as well. Its really easy to use and you do not have to have the parking break on when you do it. I think there is a censor that only allows the movement of the top to occur under 5 mph.
The interior is leather which is a nice change from my pontiac grand am with cotton looking bucket seats. You should try and take care of your leather with some type of clearner, and rub it down at least once a week to make sure you keep the material in good shape.
For a V4 its really quick on the gas. For making quick turns, pulling out in front of cars and speeding up quickly, its very useful. Because the car is so small, the V4 is good enough for the weight of the car.
Its also a two-seater which is what I preferred. I used to be the one to drive people around because my car was big, with 4 doors and lots of room in the back. However, now since I can only take one passanger, less people are asking me for rides and I didn't have to be mean about it.

Probably the worst thing about the car, in my car particulary, was the fact that I didn't get a CD-changer so I can't play CDs in the car. The cd-changer you need is only made by mercedez and it costs around 600. But thats not all, you also need the mounting brackets and special fiber optic cables to go from the changer (which is mounted in the trunk) to the player on the dash. Together thats another 150. Plus around 75 for installation. So your looking at around 825 just to put in a cd-changer if you don't already have it. One major suggestion is to buy one with the changer included.
The other downfall of the car is the fact that it needs 91 octane gas to function correctly. I get around 21 mpg, which is descent, but not as good if I was getting that with 87 or 89 octane gas. There is usually a 25 cent difference between gas. I fill up about every week, and I fill up about 12 gallons every time. That means I have to pay $3 extra per refill, which means an extra $16 a month, and about $200 per year.
The fact that the car is a V4 is also kind of weak since many convertibles are V6's nowadays.

Overall, I love the car, except for the gas and cd-changer deal. I think I'm gonna have to hold off on the cd-changer for a while until I save up some money. I would suggest you buy this car if you like small, quick, cool looking rides. I also suggest you get silver.
