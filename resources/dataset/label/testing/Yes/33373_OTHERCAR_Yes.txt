            I'm picky. I'm demanding.  The 2000 VW Jetta GLS was my pick for the next five or more years.  Why?  It looks great.  If is matters to you, many people mistake it for the small Mercedes or BMW.  With its 15&quot; low-profile tires, great paint job, and avante gard body design, it'll get you some attention.  

That's not all it'll get you.  I bought the TDI (turbo diesel injection). This morning I pumped in 9 gallons of fuel after 450 miles on the road.  Do the math.  I bought it for that reason and some others.  VW stands behind it with a big time warranty--100K power-train warranty and a full, everything covered (right down to oil changes) two year or 24K warranty.  All these and more are the reasons I picked it over the Volvo S40.  The inside is plush and comfortable, and I'm 6'4&quot; and 230 lbs.  The five speed, which i opted for, is quick and responsive, not to mention fun.  Oh yeah, the trunk.  Really big--wait 'til you see it.  With its central locking, cruise, power windows, and six-change trunk mounted CD player you'll rock as you roll.  I do.  The Monsoon Sound System is awesome with eight speakers.  

 Safety features like front and side air bags, central locking system, and anti-lock brakes
will cut down on the insurance rates which,  by the way, were shockingly low.  Go for it.  This is a good car and great looking.  The handling is not Porsche, but it's good--really.  Very good mover in traffic.  

Jetta has more room on the inside than the outside tells.  Lots of extra features you'll discover and that little flip key is fun and convenient.  Considering Jetta?  Let me take you for a ride you'll buy one.
