             Being a owner of two Nissans I am very glad to write on this subject. Nissan has always proven themselves with vehicles. This includes economy, comfort, and all around great car. Biggest problem with these cars would be there four cylinder engines. Do not get me wrong, that is what makes them so economical. But living in Montana, as I do, this is a problem for those mountain passes. I believe anyone would love this vehicle. Including people with kids. Though you are running all over town, it will not show on the gas gauge nor wear on the vehicle as long as the regular maintenance is kept up.<br><br>
