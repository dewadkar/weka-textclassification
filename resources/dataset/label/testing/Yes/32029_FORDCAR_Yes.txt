            First off, I just want to say that I LOVE MY EXPLORER!
I decided I did not want a car I only wanted an SUV.  I searched all the reviews and decided the ford explorer would be the best one for me.  I have a 1996 XLT with a V6 engine.  I bought the explorer with comfort in mind.  I have a bad knee and driving a regular sized car for long periods of time seemed to aggravate it.  I don't have this problem with my truck, the seats are the same way you would sit in a chair.  I have taken eight hour rides and never felt uncomfortable for a minute.  The ride however comfortable is very bumpy.  To me this is not a problem because I do not mind the bumps.  For those who do I have been told that the v8 engine offers a better ride.
Safety wise the car is also wonderful to me.  A month after I got the car I was in an accident, the police and the ambulance driver could not believe the lack of damage to my car considering the type of accident I was in.  The car is very spacious and roomy, no one in the back or front has ever complained of lack of room.  The back offers plenty of cargo storage and the back row of seats fold down to offer more storage.  
One of the negative aspects of this vehicle is the gas.  The car uses an incredible amount of gas.  However that is to be expected with any suv.
Some problems I've had with the car were tires that kept going out of alignment, the check engine light would go on after hitting severe bumps, and once the gears were stuck in four wheel drive when it should have been in 2.
