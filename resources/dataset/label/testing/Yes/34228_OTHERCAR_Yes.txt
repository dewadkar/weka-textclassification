            I had the great privilege of driving this car for a week from Chicago to Boulder, CO this past September.  It was a most incredible driving experience.  I was thoroughly impressed.  They almost had to peel me off the bumper to take the car back at the rental place. I didn't want to let it go! 

It was love at first sight.  The exterior and interior styling of this little coupe is classy, stylish, and sporty all at the same time.  It is one beautiful car. My particular model was a silver 2000 V6 engine with 4000 miles on it and all the trimmings.  Wood grain interior dash, CD player, power everything, tilt, moonroof, and the list goes on.  Even the cupholders were nice! They actually held my big gulp without making it lean precariously towards the floor.  The lines are smooth and curvy, melting into each other seamlessly.  It even looks aerodynamic!

The interior is incredibly roomy, especially for a coupe.  I'm not that tall (5'3) but I could stretch my legs out straight in front of me in the front seat without coming across any interference and I didn't feel cramped at all, not even close. The back seat is a bit of a tight squeeze and anyone riding back there wouldn't be happy for very long, but what coupe exists that has a big back seat? None?  It was big enough to hold our mondo jumbo sized cooler without spilling everything on the floor and still giving us room to crawl back there, and that was all we cared about. I could actually stand up comfortably (though hunched over) in the back there was so much extra room.    

The seats are absolutely lovely.  Almost ungodly comfort.  On a 17-hour straight drive from one city to the other, neither me nor my friend got sore or tired.  We were singing it's praises from minute one to minute last.  Luxury reigns supreme in this car.  This is a car you still look forward to getting back into after 17 hours in it.

Driving is stupendous, though our particular car needed some realignment (it could have been my fault..I went over a curb pretty hard).  Quick response, solid handling, minimal body roll, excellent acceleration, excellent breaking.  Even in the high altitude, this little baby had no problem getting up and down the mountains.  The brakes didn't even overheat coming down Pikes Peak..we shot right through the checkpoint. Speed and power were impressive...I got up to 100 mph without even realizing it, the ride was so smooth, quiet, and effortless.  No road noise except the expected quiet hum, no disturbing engine noise, nothing. Even going up the mountain, we had to hold it back rather than encourage it on.  These horses want to work! 

I can't really speak too much on reliability, since I only had this car for a week, but we were constantly in it and drove it about 4000 extra miles all told with absolutely no problems whatsoever.  

Gas mileage is fantastic.  It is so impressive.  We filled the tank up 2, maybe 3 times at the most from Chicago to Boulder and back again.  It has to get at least 30/35, is what I would guess. The only problem was that the internal switch would turn the gas pump off before the tank was actually full, but that is easy to fix.  

What have I missed? The negatives.  Ummm...I can't afford to actually buy one? Though they are totally affordable cars for someone who isn't a 21-year-old college student.  You can get a 2000 for $19,000 with all the goodies.  There really aren't any negatives I can find with this car.  Storage room inside was sufficient for a cross country trip, more than adequate for everyday use, trunk was a good size to hold a week's worth of overpacking for two girls, sound system was definately good.  I loved every minute with this car and a part of me went with it when we gave it back! 

This car doesn't belong in the compact car section, it belongs in the luxury section.  <br><br>
