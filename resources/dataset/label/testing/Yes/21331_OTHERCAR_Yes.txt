            If your a middle class person in a middle class world youd probably want a middle class car. So therefore your most likely gonna have to decide by the two most popular companies around today Honda and ofcourse Toyota. The Toyatas are so much similar to Hondas that its unbelievable. They are mid-class cars with a sporty kind of boxy look. They never give up on the road and uphold in accidents lovely. I believe if it wasnt for my toyota camry i woulda been killed this past winter in that horrible 6 car pile up i got in which included the 90 dodge daytona which got wrecked. These cars have everything your lookig for in a luxurious vehicle except at half the price. I swear to you it might be the best investment you can think of when it comes to cars.<br><br>
