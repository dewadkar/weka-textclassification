            I ordered this from a discount yahoo shop with concern. I risked a bad order for a better price.  However the risk was worth it. 
This camera is simply amazing. It makes my older point and shoot film camera a kids toy. The picture is amazing.  Awesome colors, and resolution.  I'm disappointed by going with the S75, instead of it's 4 megapixel brother S85.  I saved $200 in the difference.
The features are plentiful. You can leave everything on auto, or you can manually set the white balance, aperature, and other settings for each shot.  This is great for either a more experienced photographer, or a casual one like me. 
I love the ability to shoot black and white or color with minimal switchover time.
The max resolution of 2048 eats up the memory stick pretty quick. If plan on using that resolution all the time I suggest 128 stick purchase.  However since I reduce the picture size to 1024 on my PC, I'm very pleased with shooting my pictures at 1600.  This gives me a bit more space on my own 64 mb stick.
After a very extensive research on the internet, I'm pleased with my final choice.

The tricky thing for me right now is the flash and shooting. Normal flash seems to be TO BRIGHT for me, so I switched to low flash, which looks more natural indoors.  I'm also still working with the shot button. Pressing it halfway down for the camera to focus before shooting IS tricky.  However, despite my bumbling my shots still come out great. I love the AF Illuminator option. It shoots a red beam on the intended subject in low light for the camera to autofocus before shooting. Even very low light, my flash pictures come out clear and no red eye!

Oh and I've only had it for 2 days.
