            As the proud new owner of a white 2000 Ford Mustang Coupe base V6 model 5 spd, I am very pleased with my purchase.
Like most teens, when buying a car I was looking for performance, and styling in one cheap and readily available pachage. where else to turn than the Ford Mustang. Known commonly as the affordible sports car, the 2000 Mustang carries a wonderful tradition. 

I own a used 2000 base model V6 Mustang, white, 5spd. It has 33,000 miles on it and is in good condition (after $1,100 in repairs)

But there is one diffenence in my mustang than in most other mustangs you see, I paid half of what they paid and for the exact same car. Now, buying a car is all strategy (although I got lucky) I bought my car from a 21 year old pregnant mother who knew nothing about selling cars. 
KBB Value on my car ranges from $11,500-$12,500 (depending if you call it good or excellent condition) and I bought my car for $8,000 plus another 1,100 in repairs, but they were external, and that included adding a spoiler.

My friend just bought a new mustang for around $21,000 (nearly 2x what i paid) and he got the same car without a spoiler and in a red i don't perticularily care for.
HA!

But back to the car review.

One thing I love about mustangs is how you can accessorize them. I just bought 17 ich chrome Cobra R wheels, and they look beautiful. I highly reccomend them to anyone with a mustang. They improved the looks of my car 10x.

I also purchased brushed aluminium dash highlights, brushed aluminum pedals, and a brushed aluminum shift knob. 
These upgrades greatly improved the look of my interior, and I would reccomend touching up the inside since the factory interior is a bit bland.

My handling and acceleration are beautiul in my stang. Within 10 seconds of getting my new wheels (which are 17x9's, substantially wider than the factory wheels) I could feel a differance in handling and reduction in roll. 

Off the line i have smoked numerous cars including Camaros, Integras, and a Porche once (although i don't think the guy knew how do drive it very well)

Overall I love my car and would reccommend it to anyone!
