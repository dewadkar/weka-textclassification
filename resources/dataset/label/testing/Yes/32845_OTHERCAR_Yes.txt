            My roommate was recently looking for cameras and he asked me for advice.  I recommended that he try this digital camera from Nikon because I had heard that it was in his price range and was of high quality. Instantly he was hooked and I have also been very impressed since he made the purchase.  The camera is not cheap at around 650 dollars; however, it is one of the few very high quality models that can be purchased for under $900 or often much more.  

The first thing that strikes me about the camera is the fact that the photos that result are extremely sharp.  This is perhaps the most important feature that I look at when deciding on a camera.  Furthermore, the controls are easy to use and the camera is not at all heavy. Some other digital cameras that have come out lately are somewhat heavy; however, this one is easily portable with a net weight of just under 12 ounces.

Perhaps the most unique feature of this camera is the fact that it has a scene mode.  I have not seen this type of thing before and have been quite interested in this feature. The scenes to choose from include portrait, ice/snow, beach,fireworks, close up and landscape among others.  The user sets the scene and the camera optimizes the settings from there.  I have found that this feature works quite well and certainly provides some unique photos.

The 2.5x optical zoom that the camera possesses is very functional and is comparable to that of many higher priced models.  The camera offers macro focus, auto focus and manual focus.  The are all fairly easy to use and the owner will learn their individual capabilities within a short while of purchasing the camera.  A further feature of the camera that I have noticed is the fact that in dimly lit areas the photos are very clear.  This is nice to have being that this is not one of the ultra-expensive models.

Finally, this camera allows the user to play 45 seconds of video in the movie mode.  This is continuous playback and I have found that it works well.  In terms of playback, there is also a quick play mode which allows the user to display previously taken photographs. Furthermore, all the usual features such as continuous shooting and image sharpening are available with this camera. 

All in all, this camera provides a very quality option for those who cannot afford to spend an arm and a leg.  True, 650 dollars for a camera is not cheap; however, for somewhat serious photographers, this is a very good bargain. The battery life is somewhat slim, but rechargeables can be purchased for those users who plan to be taking a great deal of shots.  This is a very small downside though, and with everything taken into consideration I have found this to be a camera with many features and high quality.<br><br>
