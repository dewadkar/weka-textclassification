            This minivan is Chevy's jump into the world of minivans. I suppose that Chevy figured if every other company can sell a minivan, so could they. Well, I suppose a minivan is a minivan, but the 1998 3-door version left much to be desired. 

The front seat is very roomy. In fact, It's almost obscene. You could probably fit a pool with a changing area inside the front two seats. Once you get behind there, however, the space begins dwindling.

I spent much of my youth in the  back area of a Dodge Caravan. While it was never easy to slide out of it, it was easier to get out of that version than Chevy's version. It was also much roomier in the back tiers of Dodge's older version. 

I think that the back seats of the Venture are just too low to the ground. It almost feels like I'm squatting when I am back there. And don't even ask about the true back seat. It's hard as hell to get back there, and harder to get out once you have settled. 

The design of this car is eye-pleasing. It isn't like driving a rectangle box. The tinted windows may seem a little too darkly done, but that is how they come from the dealer. And if you take the back seats out, you have so very much storing room. Taking the seats out is a bit of a pain, so if you do it, make sure to do it at a time that you won't need to put it back immediately. <br><br>
