            I leased a 1997 Nissan Maxima SE 3 years ago, and it is by far my favorite car that I've owned.  It is such a pleasure to drive.  I love everything about it from the leather seats, to the electric sunroof.  The car also handles very well in all types of weather conditions.  I was nervous the first time I had to drive it in the snow, but it handled really great.  I've owned five Nissans in the past, and I've had good luck with all of them.  I haven't had to have any service work done on my Maxima in three years, aside from oil changes.  The Maxima, and other Nissan's that I've owned, are definitely the most reliable and trouble free cars.<br><br>
