            This car, as many others, is a dream car for most.  Ranging from about 8000-10000 or up it is a great car.  The pin-point steering and handling lets you whip around any curve at vitally any speeds depending on your rim size.  Comfort is very easily found in this year of the Eclipse as long as you are not over 6 foot or trying to put 4 people in the car.  As fare as power goes,  for a 4 banger?  DANG!!!!!!!  it gets up and out there.  I've noticed that the manuals have a bit more power than the automatics probably because you, the driver, have all controls of shifting.  I maxed my non-turbo eclipse out at 160 before I chickened out.   As fare as any problems with the car I have only had a couple, but it just goes with the car.  My horn stopped working and the door handle broke  off one day.  The engine has been driven hard and has not given me any problems at all.  In overall I believe that if you are looking for a budget race car or just something to show off with I strongly advise you to buy a 95 Eclipse<br><br>
