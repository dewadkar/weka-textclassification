            My company is buying a fleet of customer service vehicles and my assignment was to put 500 miles on a Honda Insight and convey my impressions. I was also assigned to drive a Toyota Prius of which I will write a separate opinion.  
We operate a Internet service company in northern Nevada and our cars average 180 miles per day each. I rented an Insight from EV rentals in San Francisco at the airport. Budget rent-a-car handles the operation at SFO for EV rentals which is based in Los Angeles. The reason we rented is that in northern Nevada it is impossible to find an Insight to take a test drive.
 I picked up the hybrid and soon I was on the Bayshore in heavy traffic. I was suprised that in the first two gears the car felt like any other small Honda. The handling was good in downtown San Francisco. As a matter of fact the car overall was a delight. It did take a few seconds to get used to the auto shutoff at the stoplights. It was strange sitting there in silence until I put the car in gear then you go! 
    The fuel mileage was nothing short of incredible. 68 mpg from the airport "SFO" to Carson City Nevada, and 73.3 average on the return trip. The reason the mileage was better on the way back was I had adapted better to driving the car and of course it's downhill. I was convinced the company was going to purchase three of these until I got high in the mountains over Donner pass. Any small grade on the highway means shifting down at least twice. The "helper" electric motor whos torque was quite a boon at low speeds was just not there at higher speeds. 
    I quickly used up the charge in the battery in a vain attempt to compensate for the lack of power in the mountains. In the cars favor the battery charged up quickly going down the other side of the mountain. After spending more time with the car I learned to use the power in the battery pack  with more skill. A great help in learning this is the LCD dash display. The car is a great teacher and will assist you in learning the proper technique for attaining VERY high mileage.
     On rough roads the car is noisy with the high pressure tires transmitting sound to the high tech aluminum body. Another negative is the tires "follow" seams in the road. You have to pay attention on poor pavement. The standard radio and speakers are fair at best. I would not recommend the car for mountain driving, however if I lived near the bay and had to commute this would be the ticket. A nice plus even driving alone you can use the diamond lanes, that little bonus alone is worth the price of admission. 
  If you want a used Insight contact EV rentals on the web and they sell used cars from their rental fleet.
