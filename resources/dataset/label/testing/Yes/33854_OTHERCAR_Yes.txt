              The Mercury Villager &quot;Multi Sport&quot; is an economical option for the Mercury product.  My wife and I researched all of the mini vans during the summer of 1998.  Then we reduced to field to the Dodge Caravan and the Mercury Villager.  Both vehicles had &quot;sporty&quot; models with features that I desired.  The two vehicles also had basically the same standard options. There were several areas that one or the other vehicle was superior.
  It came down to the closing deal and the performance of the vehicle.  The Mercury dealership won me over with their bargaining and the low percentage interest rates.  The vehicle is White with white and blue wheel covers and a nice looking blue stripe along each side.  Nice looking when clean.  
  The only option we added was a CD Rom.  
  Anyway, in less than 1 1/2 years later now, the Villager has been driven to Virginia and back over a three day weekend from Wisconsin. We took the middle seats out and used the van as a cargo vehicle.  Upon emptying the household goods, we then used the bench seat and drove throughout the Winchester, Virginia area. 
  It was driven throughout Florida for our 30th anniversary, including Key West, a distant of over 4000 miles round trip without any problems.  In fact, one day we started off in freezing weather and then had to turn the air conditioner on to cool off. 
  Last summer we made a quick trip to Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas to visit relatives and again no problems even in a blinding thunderstorm.
  Quite a vehicle!  Check them out.  Not all vans are made by Daimler-Chrysler, GM, and Toyota.<br><br>
