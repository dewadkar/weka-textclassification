            After an exhaustive search and many hours of SUV research I decided to purchase the 2003 Honda Pilot EX-L. Now after my first 1000 miles I can say with no hesitation that this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. The ride, looks, price and overall feel surpasses that of any other SUV on the market and if you add into the equation Honda's performance record I can't imagine purchasing any other SUV. I have personally owned a Pathfinder as well as an Explorer. When it came to this current purchase I test-drove the new Mountaineer, Trailblazer, Envoy, Acura MDX, Sequoia, Highlander, and finally the Pilot. In the end the Pilot seemed to share all the positive points of all the aforementioned vehicles and put it into one package. Now the one draw back is its rated towing capacity, but come on how many times am I ever going to tow something over 5,000 lbs. I'm 35 and in the first 35 years I have yet to do it and I have no future plans to tow anything other than my 2 jet skis. This SUV really has no competition because it takes the best from the best and adds that understated quality that Honda adds to all their vehicles.
