            I purchased my 1995 850 Turbo, automatic, sedan in late November 1997 with 35,000 miles on the &quot;clock.&quot;  Having driven a 760 Turbo for several years prior to this purchase, I'd come to appreciate the quality and safety built into Volvos.  What I did not expect was the major improvement in acceleration over my 760 Turbo, the engine of which displaces exactly the same 2.3 liters as that in the 850-T.  I'd expected an incremental improvement since the 850 is five cylinders and twin overhead cam versus four with a single overhead cam in the 760.  I was shocked by the difference.  I can't give you acceleration times to support this claim, but I can sure feel it in the seat of my pants.  So, if your looking for a solidly built, comfortable sedan that can excite your driving spirit, try this vehicle.<br><br>
