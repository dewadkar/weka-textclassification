            I bought a S-320 and S-500 from Mercedes Benz because I have always trusted Mercedes Benz and have all of my cars bought from Mercedes. I especially love the S-class. The car has perfect control, good speed, good sound system, and it is a very smooth riding car. If your interested in small cars, then this car is not for you. That is basically the only disadvantage of this car. When you pop in a tape, or use the six CD changer, the music surrounds you and it doesn't even seem like its a tape or CD but rather that the music is being played around you because of the great and powerful Bose Sound System built into the car. When driving over a bumpy road, you can hardly feel the bumps and the smoothness of the drive makes you want to relax. The leg room in the car is great and the spacing of the whole car and the nice leather seats make it cozy. Because of a cozy car and smooth riding, it is easier to fall asleep when being a passenger. Basically, all I am saying is that it is a good- sorry-a great car. I recommend this car to all, that is, all who can afford it. But even if you don't have a good amount of money to buy this car, I still recommend it.<br><br>
