            If you need something to haul the kids around in, get the Caravan and save a few bucks but if you are looking for comfort for the car pool or long distance driving hauling a load, get the T&amp;C.  

This is an adult van. My Dad sold his business and wanted to treat himself to a new vehicle. He wanted a van because he likes to be up where he can see the traffic and he wanted a luxury car. This is the ticket, with heated leather seats and a great sound system you can't ask for more.

I have a friend with a Mercedes and as far as interior comfort is concerned the T&amp;C is just as nice.

About one week after he bought it Dad and I drove to Chicago from Colorado and it was as nice a ride as you can have. I drove the whole way and found it very confortable and handled well fully loaded.

It's about 7 months old now and I have not noticed any major flaws.
