            In 1998, after the birth of my third child, I decided the time had come to purchase a Caravan.  Not being able to afford a brand new one, I knew I would have to purchase used.  It took me months to find one that is my price range without a million miles on it.  At last I found one.  At a dealer, a 1993 with only 48,000 miles on it.  Two other family members have caravans and have not had problems with them.  One has 150,000 miles on it!!!  Anyway, I have put 20,000 miles on mine, and the only cost I have put into it are the usual maintenance (oil changes and the like).  I have NOT had to replace the brakes (even after 20,000), though I will soon, as they seem to be wearing out.  I discovered that my air conditioner is not working, but on 7 year vehicle it is expected to have it down at some point(true I do not know if this is the first time it has gone)  I have read about the transmissions problems a lot people have had, and I have not had any, nor have my other family members.  Personally, I think that is a chance you take with any vehicle purchase.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with my van and would definately recommend it to family and friends.  <br><br>
