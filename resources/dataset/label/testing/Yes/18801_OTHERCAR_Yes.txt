            My husband and I began shopping around for a new vehicle over the past two months.  After we shopped around at dealerships, we knew the best route to take would be a private owner.  Then the deal of a lifetime fell into our lap three weeks ago.  It was a 1998 Jeep Cherokee Classic.  This vehicle only had 34,000 miles, was super clean, power everything (except seats), and the best part was the fact that it was about $2500 less than we were ready to pay!

Needless to say, we did our research in a hurry.  We did not want this good deal to slip through our hands.  Three days after we test drove the Jeep, we purchased it.  So far, we are very pleased.  

My husband, being a 20-year experienced mechanic says that the straight 6-cyl. engine will last forever if it is maintained properly and that everything else is relatively easy to work on.  (This is a huge plus for us.  He will actually want to work on the Jeep. :-&gt;)  

And, of course, this is more of a family vehicle than a Ford Ranger (what we are replacing).  Now we have a vehicle where we can safely put our baby in a rear-facing car seat in the rear seat, and not have to worry about getting the car stuck in the snow this winter.

In conclusion, if you are in the market for an SUV, the Jeep Cherokee is a sure bet.  The prices for a brand new model are quite high, but it is possible to find a &quot;barely used&quot; one that you can get a great deal on.  Good luck shopping!<br><br>
