            So you want a Digital Camera?  Price ofcourse is the primary consideration.  Otherwise, you'd get the best.  But since you cant afford the best, you want to know which camera will suit you, without spending too much on features you dont really need.  At the same time, you have saved enough money not to buy the cheapest lemon on the racks.  You want good pictures on your computer, and you want it now.

If all your considerations are: 1) Its digital 2)The it has zooming capabilities 3) It has features an ordinary camera won't have 4)  It can transfer the pics into your computer without hassle 5) a reasonable price,   then the Sony MVC-FD73 is a perfect choice.

It does not boast of the techie features like the upscale models do.  Quite honestly, who understands those technical definitions anyway.  Even if we do buy them, how sure are we that they are relevant enough for us to use.  The Sony MVC-FD73 is a straightforward digital camera that does what a digital camera should do.  It takes pictures in normal, b&amp;w, sepia, or solarize format, and transfers then to your PC.

Its diskette drive is a great advantage over even the higher scale models.  Sure the others brag of USB ports and memory disks.  But we, the normal dad, brother, mother, student would not think of the usb port when we take pictures of our Child's first birthday!  You travel to Europe, you took a great picture of the Eiffel Tower and cant wait to send it home! But ALAS! The PC in your hotel doesnt have a USB port! And if it does, you have to install your Camera program first.  I haven't been around the world buy Im pretty sure all of them have disk drives.

Thats how the Sony MVC-FD73 works.  Straight forward, simple.  NO added features you wont need.

Some things however might be a small inconvenience.  The view finder is an LCD screen, thus you do not place your eyes on the viewfinder.  This produces glare sometimes, and the screen is not as protected.  It is left open to the elements. I havent scratched my screen so far, I am not sure if it is because I am careful or of the lens is really sturdy.  Nonetheless, Id feel more comfortable if it was protected.

It is also bulky compared to other digital cameras.  Many have mistook it for a video camera.  Not quite handy when you have a small bag.  Other than that, it is aperfect gadget for someone who just wants to have digital pictures, and who doesnt work as a photographer professionally.<br><br>
