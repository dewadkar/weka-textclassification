            When I went to my local ford dealership looking for a car, I was willing to spend about $20,000 on a new car. I was thinking of something along the lines of a taurus, but as soon as I decided to give the focus a try, I knew that a small price tag is not always a signal of sub-par quality. To start, although the focus appears to be small, it really has quite a bit of space, especially in the two front seats, but also in the back. The features that ford has put into this vehicle make it a great buy. With the gas situation as it is, another benefit of the focus is its great gas mileage. The design is great.. not too boxy, but not too radical either. Even better is the fact that although the engine is small, it is definitely no slouch. The ride is relatively smooth, and the car is enjoyable to drive. The Focus is just a total package, and to tell you the truth, even if it cost $20,000, I might have just chosen it over a Taurus after all.<br><br>
