            I went to the 1999 Washington D.C auto show and was looking for SUV's.  I wanted an SUV with class, it had to be small, five seats, all wheel drive and look nice.  

I looked around the auto show and picked out two cars.  The Mercedes M-class, and the Lexus RX300.  I went to my local Lexus Dealer to test drive the Lexus.  It was great.  It has a very smooth ride.  It has great suspension and feels very comfortable.  I never expected this car to be so nice.  I liked the champagne color the most.  

This car has 1 con though.  When you open one of the passenger windows it makes a deafening sound that hurts your ears.  I next went to the Mercedes dealer to test drive the M-class.  I didn't like it very much at all.  It was very tight and it was hard to turn the wheel.  It felt like I was driving a truck.  

I went back to the Lexus dealer to try the car one more time.  This time I really noticed the cars beauty.  I is so elegant.  When you turn the wheel The car softly moves as you turn.  I bought the car that day and have been loving it ever since I have bought it.  Its great.  People who should buy this car are the people who like to live nicely.  Who can afford the price and want a overall good car.   <br><br>
