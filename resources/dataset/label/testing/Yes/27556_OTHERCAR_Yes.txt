              We needed a Sport Utility Vehicle but recoiled from the price tags approaching $30,000 or more.  After a careful search and test driving three others, we decided on the Jeep Grand Cherokee for three basic reasons.
1.  My short wife had no problem reaching the pedals or seeing out of all windows/
2.  It is large enough for our needs but, more than the others we tested (Explorer, 4 Runner, Blazer)it handled more like a car.
3.  It's a Jeep!
  Fortunately for the used car buyer, Chrysler cars lose value quickly in the first few years.  Therefore, we found at a dealer a 3 year old red one with 23,000 miles.  We bought it for $18,700, about $10,000 under original cost.

  Great features: Close to a car-like ride; 15+ mpg in city; great handling; distinctive looks.   <br><br>
