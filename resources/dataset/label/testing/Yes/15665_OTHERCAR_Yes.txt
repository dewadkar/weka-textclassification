            I bought this as my first digital camera as i did not want any of those problems with cables, this camera is great is easy to use and does not require any cables only floppy disks which for someone who wants simplicity this is your camera. Great feature is the mpeg feature which allows you to record either one minute  or three minute digital video clips which are readable on a windows media player. The mavica is currently a bit pricey but if you like a camera and video camera in one this is your darling. Problem with it though is you need to stock up on floppys if you intend to record a lot of mpegs.<br><br>
