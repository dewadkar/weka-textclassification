            I bought my 90' Galant used in 6/91. I traded my brand-new mine off the line special ordered 91' Geo Storm GSI in on the purchase of this gallant, 
because my family continued to grow but my Geo didn't. I needed a good, reliable, attractive, mid-size car at a reasonable price. It had 18,000 miles on it and was previously a lease car. It was basically as good as new when we purchased it. Since that time, I have most definitely &quot;USED AND ABUSED&quot; that poor defenseless car! For example, I live in Colorado where we are subjected to all types of whether and road conditions, and since I almost always have my children with me I needed to think of their safety as well as feel safe with its' handling when I'm behind the wheel. I am happy to report that I got that with my Galant.
 It has also been involved in 4 accidents (not all with me driving). I'm proud to report that out of all 4 accidents, there were no injuries to any of the passengers of my car.  The thing that I find most embarrassing to me and most impressive about the motor is that just over 4 yrs. ago, I failed to check my oil level and ran the car on just a half quart of oil  for over 3 1/2 weeks. Obviously this caused some major damage to the engine as the years have passed.  Such as smoke coming from the tail pipe if it just sits and idles.  Yet the only items that I have had to invest in for repairs thus far is brakes, gaskets, general tune-up items, tires, c.v. axles, a motor mount, a battery, and a starter. I don't think that's very bad at all.  Especially seeing how it has made more than 5 long distance trips that were over 500 miles one way.  Yet to this day that car is still running strong! That's NO LIE! I would definitely buy another Galant should this one ever die. *--.
