            My husband purchased our Jeep Cherokee against my best wishes.  I really wanted a mini-van.  But after some heated conversation, we decided to go with the Jeep.  I instantly fell in love with it.  I was really concerned with the room considering we have three children and a golden retriever.  I have yet to be disappointed with the space available.  It is stylish, rugged, and tough enough to drive through ice and snow with very little problem.  

For an SUV, I feel that the ride is fairly smooth and quiet.  I kind of thought it would be like riding in a Jeep Wrangler which is very noisy.  My kids love it.  I feel like we can go out in the woods and not have to worry about roughing up the vehicle.  It was made for tough conditions.

I would highly recommend this vehicle for people with children or pets.  I think that Jeep has made a great name for itself, and our vehicle has yet to decrease in value.  We have owned it for a year now and have had no breakdowns of any sort.  We have had to do scheduled maintenance and replace the tires (it's a 95).  

The one downfall to owning an SUV is that they tend to be gas guzzlers.  Right now, that doesn't make it alot of fun to fill up the tank.  

But, all in all, I am more than happy with it and would happily own two.  I have several friends and family members that have owned Cherokees that swear by them.  I am now a member of the &quot;Dedicated to Jeep&quot; family and darn proud of it!<br><br>
