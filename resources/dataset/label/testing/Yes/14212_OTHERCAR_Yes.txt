            I bought my car g20 in August 2000, with the leather and convenience package.  I believe I got a great deal.  What brought me to the car immediately was the styling.  I liked the european look to the car with the side marker lights, compact design, and i think the rear lighting scheme makes it one of the best looking rear ends out there in my humble opinion.  Inside the car, they included all the amenities that i could want in a car that was under $23,000, including an automatic climate control system, moonroof, luxurious leather seats, power drivers seat, fantastic bose stereo system with cd and tape player, side/driver/passenger airbags, relatively spacious trunk.   

One option I regret not getting was the car seat heaters.  Winters will be cold on my butt.  By not getting the car seat heaters, i couldn't get the side view mirror defrosters.  I didn't realize that i didn't have defrosters on my side mirrors until I left the lot.  I had this option on all my previous cars, so now lacking the ability to defrost my side view mirrors from inside the car is rather annoying.  Who likes to stop and get out to wipe down these things that stick out my door?  But you gotta do it for everyone's safety.  

Now to the engine, many people would say that this four banger isn't powerful enough, but to me it proves "adequate."  I would love a V-6, but thats impossible with this engine bay.  However, once you get into the 4000 rpm range, the engine is highly responsive and lively, I only find that the engine lacks at low rpms.  The one thing i could never complain about is the handling in the car.  I can pull turns and pass people with ease in the corners.   

Things had been going relatively well for the first 3 months i had the car, but once winter set in the Northeast, a foul sulfur like odor started to emanate from the vents and the tailpipe.  It was unbearable.  I immediately called the infiniti dealer and they told me to bring the car in.  They told me that they've had problems like this before and they tried to solve the problem. They change some settings in the engine and told me to use low sulfur fuel.  Luckily, this worked for me.  The smell was gone and i never had to return again.   

I also considered the Nissan Maxima and ruled it out because I didn't need such a large car and also to get the same options i would have needed to spent another 2 - 3 thousand.  A jetta was also on my short list.  It seemed to me everyone owned a jetta and I wanted something different.  Also, the warranty coverage was not as long. 

In the end, I adore my car.  I like to take both long and short trips.  I think the car is made solidly and infiniti warranty should ease qualms.
