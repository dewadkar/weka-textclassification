                 A short time ago I was driving on the highway and someone cut me off so badly that I slammed right into them.  The impact from the crash caused their car to flip over two and a half times, while my Saturn remained relatively still.  Everyone was all right from the accident but the condition that my 95 Saturn SC amazed me.  I slammed into a car at 50 miles per hour, but to my surprise the damage to my Saturn was minimal.  Moreover, my passenger as well as myself felt nothing during the impact of the collision.  The safety that was provided by my Saturn was remarkable.  
    The visibility provided by the windshield is greater than any other car that I have driven in that price range.  You almost have full visibility of the road with little obstruction from the roof supports and the rear-view mirror.  
     The Saturn handles the road really well, but the acceleration is sluggish at best.  With a 0-60 time well over 11 seconds do not expect to win any races; however, from the lackluster 1.9 liter engine you receive at least 25 mpg. 
     If you are concerned about you family's safety and are concerned over the steadily increasing gas prices the Saturn SC is the perfect car for you. <br><br>
