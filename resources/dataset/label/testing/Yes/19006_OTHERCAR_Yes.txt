            The early release 2003 Hyundai Tiburon is a hit for all ages.  If you are 16 and your parents won't buy you a muscle car or if your 40 and going through your mid-life crisis this car is an adrenaline junkies dream.  An owner of a 2003 Tiburon will soon wake up in the morning and look forward to driving to work that is of course excluding stop and go traffic.  If you are going to get a Tiburon then I strongly suggest the GT V.6 Ultra Package #3(fully loaded).  This heart pumping package comes with a 6 speed manual transmission, an with an almost to high body colored high spoiler, aluminum foot pedals, powertilt/slide sunroof, and ABS with the much needed Traction control system.  If of course you cannot drive a manual transmission you can always get the automatic with the shift-tronic option that allows you to shift the gear as you please by just tapping the shift nob and the great thing about it is that it has no clutch.  When your showing off around town roll your windows down and turn up your seven speaker Infinity stereo system.  The stereo has great sound but the sub woofer in the trunk was a little disappointing.  If you cruise for to long you might not be to comfortable it has great looking seats but they are very stiff.  You absolutely do not want to go on vacation with your friends in this car, the back seats has just enough room for a a purse and a gym bag.  From the driver side everything is easy to get to, I thought that the dash unit was a little bland nothing a little carbin fiber wouldn't spice up.  The manual shifter is smooth but if you are racing or if you just want to speed shift 3rd gear is 5 miles from 2nd.  I have very little complaints with this car but every I don't like can do fixed with after market mods that shouldn't cost much at all.  I highly recommend www.sharkracing.com for all your body kits and modifications.  Performance is great in the all new 2003 V6 175hp engine in the Tiburon.  Parents worried about safety if you can talk your kids into wearing the seatbelt then you should have a good chance of the front and side impact airbags taking a roll in saving there life if they get hit.  You and your friends are probably going to be a little rough on your new sports car!  Well, just in case.  Hyundai has backed this vehicle up with a 10 year 100,000 mile warranty that will cover your engine, transmission, and you drive axles, a 5 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, and if you still don't fill confident enough to buy a Hyundai they through in a 5 year unlimited mile Roadside Assistance.  You can't beat that!  Well, you could buy a more expensive Acura RSX, a not as nice or fast Toyota Celica, or you could just do what everyone else is doing buy a $16k Honda Civic and spend $5 grand fixing it up.
