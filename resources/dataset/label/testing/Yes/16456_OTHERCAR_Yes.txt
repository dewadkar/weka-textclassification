            My husband and I loved Saturns for a long time. We went into the dealership, and told them what we were looking for. We just wanted the basics as it would keep the price down. About 2 months later, they called and said a couple had driven their car from California to Indiana to trade it in. We checked it out. The car had everything...all options for that time, yet the price was very reasonable. It was a 1 owner car and beautiful. We bought it in '97 and held on to it ever since. It had 127,000 miles on it and now has 215,000. The maintenance has been kept up on it but has never had a major mechanical problem...yet. (knock on wood). Believe it or not, the clutch has never been changed. I take it in for oil changes and they see the mileage. Instead of putting it down, like other mechanics do, they tell me to "keep going". I asked them what the highest mileage was for their vehicles, and they told me 1 person had over 300,000 miles with no problems. My husband was talking with a friend of his who worked at the main Saturn Plant in Tennessee. They have a Saturn test car with over 500,000 miles on it. With this car comes a price...you must become a true Saturn owner! Go to picnics every year and visit the Saturn Homecoming which takes place at their plant in Tennessee. Guaranteed Fun!!! You can also get a history of your car through Saturn...any work performed and its number as it rolled off the line at the Plant. I have #6,070. Not bad especially with what they are rolling out with now. Some of their cars are good but I like the older ones better as I believe they were more careful making them.
