            Let me start by saying that I have always been Chevy person.  I have never owned anything other than a Chevy and so I don't feel that I'm qualified to tell you how this truck stacks up against other brands, but I am definitely qualified to tell you how much I LOVE THIS TRUCK!

I purchased a Chevy S-10 when I was 18.  &quot;Bubba&quot;, as I called him, was a great little truck.  I put a lot of miles on him and he is still going strong, and being driven now by my little brother.  When our family grew from two to three, I began to notice that Bubba just wasn't big enough to hold Mom, baby, and all the supplies that go along with baby, as well as the groceries or whatever else we might be carrying along.  Additionally, there wasn't any room left for another passenger.  It also worried me that my daughter had to sit in in the passenger seat right next to the door because the gear shift (it was a standard) was in the middle.  So, we decided to get something a little bigger.  I naturally wanted another truck.  I love trucks, I think every family should have one, and because my husband was the &quot;car driver&quot; that left me.  We looked around and decided that the 1500 series would be best for the money.  We purchased a 1993 model with only 35,000 miles.  This truck is great! There is plenty of room for myself, the baby, and my husband or another passenger.  And there is also plenty of room for the baby to sit in the middle which I think is safer.  

We got a six-foot bed and that has been plenty of room to carry anything that we have needed.  We've carried wood flooring for our new house, a slew of Christmas presents, as well as groceries and other shopping items.  We have a bed cover which really helps to keep everything contained and dry on the way home.  

I don't know that much about the hauling performance of this truck because we haven't had to haul all that much.  We have hauled a four-wheeler, a boat, and lots of &quot;stuff&quot; when we moved and it has worked great.

The ride is very comfortable.  I commute a total of 120 miles each day to get to school and believe me, if this weren't comfortable, I wouldn't be driving it!

It does take some getting used to, especially if you are used to driving a smaller vehicle, but in no time at all you'll be trucking around like an old pro!<br><br>
