            The Kodak DCS620 has been reviewed by just about every top digi-cam website around- so I wont go into the specifics as those details are well documented on digi-cam sites. I will however give you a condensed personal "user-Epinion"and more likely in tune in what an "Epinion" reader is looking for.
  Nikon is no stranger to the world of Professional level photography. Nikon SLR's are amongst the most advanced cameras in the world- only being rivaled by Canon. As such you'd have to take serious a digital camera based on Nikon's flagship model- the Nikon F5, and that's exactly what the DCS620 is- a Digital F5. Kodak purchases Nikon F5's and re-engineers them with their own set of internal processors and CCD imagers- creating a hybrid digital camera with both Nikon and Kodak names boldly emblazond. Kodak is perhaps the single biggest "photo" developement /research company in the world and as such the marriage of their technology along with a flagship Nikon F5 body has produced a very significant digital SLR. 

The DCS620 was aimed soley at discriminating Professional Photographers and was priced accoringly- to the tune of $24,995 which was later reduced to $11,995- it became the weapon of choice for the serious photojournalist and/or sports photographer. The fortunate few "outside" professionals embraced it as a great studio camera, beside the AP camera it was designed to be.

 Because of it's F5 lineage- it's no surprise numerous professional photographers worldwide purchased the 620 and it has become a sales success for Kodak. A few noticeable features are:
-it can store it's images on Compact Flash cards, pcmcia type I,II and III devices, and likely anything that can store information with the proper type pcmcia slot adapter
 
-uses all Nikon F5 accessories (numerous)

-uses Nikon mount lenses (super high quality)

-Superb auto-focusing abilities

-works amazingly well with a flash

-employs 2 digital screens on body rear

-the best software aquisition (geard towards pros)

-enjoys "industry favorite" Kodak Support


How Well Does It Work?
  Being based on the Nikon F5 it was no surprise the camera takes outstanding photographs. It is noted for it's very accurate color rendition and clean imagery at ISO 200 to 400. It features spot,3D Matrix and center-weighted light metering and 5 points of focus as well as "dynamic" autofocusing. Adjustable ISO sensitivity from 200-1600 and shutter speeds up to 1/8000th second....just about nothing left to desire with a camera like this. To gauge it's current desirability- try to find one on eBay- you'll be hard pressed to find any used ones- if any do become available- they are often snatched up rather quickly.

Personal Use~
  I use my 620 for a wide-gamut of non-professional uses....everything from macro insect photography to fast moving action sports, the DCS620 has always produced- it is a capable camera very eager to show your lack of knowledge with missed shots should your knowledge of photography be sparse.Conversely the DCS620 will reward you with spectacular shots when using medium to high grade lenses. Action sports photography with the fastest lenses will yeild identical results as it's F5 film-based counterpart- everything from subtle macro imagery to time-lapsed photography is possible with the DCS620- a digital F5 indeed! Studio photography is well suited with it's ability to accept every F5 option, from remote shutters to pc cords to trip studio lighting- all present and accounted for. Ultra reliable metering insures very good exposure. The twin LCD's rearside show photograph taken, card capacity, histogram levels as well as white-balance settings, flash synchro-tons of more information- a very advanced featureset for the advanced user.

Year 2001
  Well times change and the DCS620 is an "old" model and only dealer left over stock is being sold as new- provided you can find a dealer with a new DCS620 laying around....the DCS 760 is the new King of  digital SLR's alongside the Nikon D1X camera....2 megapixel resolution isn't enough anymore as pros are looking to print images beyound 16"X20"- the DCS760 is also based on the Nikon F5 and bears a striking resemblance to the DCS620 (same body used)- although it uses a 6mp imager (CCD) and produces the cleanest, sharpest images in the digital slr realm alongside the D1X....with Canon's D30 producing the richest most film-like images to date in digital slr's, even the 760 and D1X will likely take a backseat to the upcoming CMOS sensored cameras almost sure to come.

Verdict
The DCS620 was a contributing factor in the developement and acceptance of digital SLR photography worldwide, and was slighlty ahead of it's time when introduced 2 years ago- by today's standards it's outdated for the most discriminating photographers who seek the very best. The upside is you may find a used DCS620 around the $4500 mark today- it's still every bit as good as written about here- if you don't need prints much larger than 8X10- the DCS620 is probably the best bet in digital SLR's today. If you can't find a clean used DCS620 and are a Nikon shooter- you may want to consider Fuji's S1 Pro- a very nice "prosumer" grade digital SLR with 6mp images.
