            <i>The automobile is just a passing fad...it will never catch on. These were common words when Henry Ford was developing the primitive automobile.  
<i>I can remember several years ago when the same was said about the digital camera.  Any person who still truly believes this probably still lives in a cave somewhere in the Vermont. (Please no hate mail from Vermont or I'll burn your trees down).
<i>In this camera, the makers came up with an unique idea.  Combine the assets with a high end digital camera with the convenience of an instant camera(better known as a "Polaroid").
<i>Before I get into the two faults of this camera, let me tell you about the good side.  It take absolutely great pictures!  Just ask your girlfriend. (Just kidding except for those of you in Vermont).  But seriously, this camera has great picture definition even at it's lowest resolution.  It will also take short movies.  Of course in this case size DOES matter.  I am speaking of your smartmedia memory card size of course.  I have taken this camera on 2 vacations and I loved the results.  
<i>The biggest problem is that battery demons haunt this camera.  They lay in wait for you to get ready to take a picture of Sasquatch or the Loch-Ness Monster and CHOMP...Your batteries are gone.  To exorcise these demons I bought the charge pack kit and keep at least one fully charged battery pack with the camera at all times.
<i>The second setback is that this camera is packed with features.  Doesn't sound like much of a setback until you can't figure the features out.  You can of course overcome this by...get this...Reading the owner's manual.  Now I am a realist and I realize that most guys have just shut their computer off in disgust at such a suggestion.  But if you want to get the full potential out of this camera, it's a necessary evil.  You don't have to admit to it, just go in a dark closet with a flashlight and pretend it's a playboy or something.  
<i>The last fault that I have heard about the C-211 is the size of it.  It is larger than the average digital camera.  I have never had any major problem with it being too bulky.  I figure it's just easier to find. 
<i>I truly recommend this camera.  The cost of it has dropped drastically.  It is still on the high side when consider buying the optional battery pack(s), but it is definitely worth it for the convenience.
<i>One last note...If you are from Vermont and took offense to this review, Don't mess with me!  I'll sick Sasquatch on you~
