            Well my parents bought this nice green 1998 V6 Grand AM...and all I could think of is when am I gonna get to go for a spin!!! Well it's been about 4or5 months since we have had it, and it's cool but there are a few things I don't think are that cool! 
        
        First, the radio oh my gosh the volume control doesn't even work you have to sit there for like 3 minutes to get the volume to go down! Second, of all the seat belts get twisted in the socket and they get stuck all the time...I hate that! Third, it kind of feels like you are in a bus...but that's probably because our last car was small.  
        
        There were also perks about the car, like when you actually got the volume to work the music sounded great. Also I like the trunk, it's really big I can even put 5 big boxes in it! Another thing I like is that it has airbags to protect you if you get into an accident. I think this car is great if you have kids because of all it's safety features like it won't let you go out of gear if you don't have your foot on the break...so if your child tries to play with the transmission stick or gear stick nothing weird will happen. All in all this car is pretty cool. I would recommend this car to people!  <br><br>
