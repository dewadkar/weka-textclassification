            Combine this review with Mr.Roberts entitled &quot;The Cougar Experience, Don't Do It&quot; review and you should have a very sound basis to make your car buying decision.

My wife and I purchased a 1999 Cougar exactly one month after it was introduced to the general public.  Like Mr.Roberts, we wanted something sporty, my wife was driving a 1994 Mercury Sable and wanted something alittle more &quot;young.&quot;  Enter the Cougar.

We test drove the Cougar and found that it handled well on all types of road surfaces, and that there was no other car on the market in the same price range that could match it's &quot;sex appeal.&quot;  So we signed the papers.  Since we have signed those papers we have enjoyed the car immensely, but like any other automobile�the cougar has its flaws.

1)The �check coolant� light is constantly on.  Dealership has no fix for the over-sensitive light. 
2)The field of vision for the front windshield is obstructed by the awkward placement of the rear-view mirror.  It is extremely low for tall people.
3)There is a constant grinding noise when the car is in gear.  Have taken the car to the dealership two times and they cannot seem to find anything wrong with the vehicle.  No fix has been offered, even though the dealership admits that there is a definite grinding noise.
4)The plastic rattles on the inside of the care all of the time.
5)Only one useable cup-holder is very annoying.  That�s the one in the back.  The one in the front is flimsy and allows your drink to dump turning corners too fast.
6)The glass quality on the vehicle is substandard.  Grainy.  Looks like the card has been exposed to many dust storms.
7) Loudest car I have ever purchased.

Positives about the vehicle include great acceleration off the line, sleek design, economical price, good stereo, great gas mileage, the trunk is absolutely huge!!!

Over-all, would I recommend the car?  You bet.  I wanted you to know about the idiosyncrasies about the design/production of the car.  I agree with consumer reports that the car is an up-and coming- Best Buy over-all.
