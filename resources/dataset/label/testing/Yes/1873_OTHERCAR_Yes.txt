            I had wanted to own a Grand Am for a couple of years, but before sinking myself into several thousand dollars' worth of loan debt on a car make I had never previously owned, I finally found and settle on a 1992 white Grand Am SE for around $3000.  It had been a one owner car (a fact my husband came across while 'rummaging through' the glove compartment), and, after calling the person who had previously owned it from our cell phone while we test drove the car, he felt it was too good to pass up, so we bought it, and have never regretted it.

We live in Oregon, and do a lot of travelling.  We live about the same distance from the Cascade Mountains as the Coast, and spend a lot of time at each.  In the first year we owned the car, I am ashamed to say we put 24,000 miles on it, however, we have put no money other than for routine maintenance (oil changes, alignment, tires, etc.) on it.  It provides a comfortable drive, and was definitely made for passenger comfort.  I liked all the compartments, and the two drink holders in the back are nice, as we have a five year old daughter - enough said!  We have the four cylinder SE, which is not likely to win any 0-60 mph contests (unless they're against a bicyclist, and I don't mean the motorized ones), but what the four cylinder lacks in Horsepower, it makes up for in gas mileage.  I get close to 30 in town, and 38 - 40 on the highway.  With gas prices for regular unleaded in the $1.65 range, that saves some money.

This past June, we were rear ended in our Grand Am by a Dodge Pickup, and sustained minor trunk damage, which was enough for our car to end up in the body shop for five days.  While it was there, we got a 2000 Gran Prix GT from the rental place, and we fell in love with Pontiac all over again.  What problems they had in the late 80's early 90's has been forgiven.  Their cars are sporty, sexy, powerful, and comfortable.  What Pontiac turns out each year is better than the last, and they are quickly leaving Chevrolet, Ford, and Chrysler behind, choking on their dust.

The only problem my husband and I have now is - which do we purchase next - a Grand Am, or Grand Prix?<br><br>
