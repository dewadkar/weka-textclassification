            This Audi, just like every other I&#146ve ever driven or owned, does absolutely nothing wrong, looks better than almost everything I&#146ve ever parked it next to and is a hoot to drive. I am just disappointed that this new iteration didn&#146t completely overtake BMW&#146s 3 Series in the manner its predecessor made a gigantic leap over its predecessor just to equal the vaunted 3. Now, though, the Cadillac CTS (the first American car I&#146ve liked in a long while) and Infiniti G have hit the road, and my beautiful car has two formidable competitors that arose out of obscurity to create a virtual four way tie for first place in the toughening segment. I&#146m still a firm Audi devotee, but I am in no way biased. I believe the sculptured A4 still is a cut above its competitors by merit of many things (by a narrowing margin), but its potential wasn&#146t fully exploited in its redesign! It&#146s scary to think that a few years from now, I may be convinced into a Cadillac!

According to Motor Trend, the car accelerates to 60 in 7.0 seconds--my car was clocked at 6.4. I&#146ve since added a filtercharger and a factory authorized enhancement chip. Currently the car manages that landmark feat in 5.8 seconds.  




This car is Excellent. Solid, stable, athletic, astute, precise, agile (English adjectives are too limited to praise this car thoroughly)--it would have been Leo DaVinci&#146s car had he lived in the present since it is so capable at everything it&#146s intended for. One of the most striking things about when you view or touch absolutely anything in the car is its ingotlike perfection. A drive only reinforces that notion. Every control moves with a natural fluidity, especially the steering and the reactive tendencies of the engine/transmission and suspension. The result is a strong tinge of utter consistency and muscly ballerina grace. Strange use of words, I know, but &#147eloquent&#148 (read: fluent, forceful) certainly pops up more than once. 

The styling is derivative of other Audis, to be fair, but that isn&#146t bad. Although I hoped for a more aggressive body in the new for &#14602; A4, I can say I&#146m not disappointed with the evolution I was presented with when the car was unveiled. The Bauhaus Audi styling studios have churned out some of the most enduringly beautiful designs the auto industry has seen in the past several years (albeit not extremely salient, save the TT). I tend not to like busy designs found in current Jaguars and Mercedes, but I love the clean chic designs Audi conjures up (the Cadillac CTS is great). Lovers of modern art and frequenters of Gucci boutiques will agree with me on this one, while traditionalists may find it too unadorned. The car reeks of class--Audi has surpassed other high-zoot marques in &#147cool&#148 factor among younger buyers, and that definitely wins the car a few points. You probably won&#146t see a faceless bureaucrat in a blue pinstripe getting out of one of these in the parking garage--look for an artist or a fashion buff!

While the styling may be a point open to argument, no one can argue with the construction. Believe me, you have never seen any interior screwed together as well, and you&#146d be hard pressed to find anything this substantial feeling at any price. 

It&#146s become a game among my buddies to take road trips in my cars. Since I&#146m barely past the legal drinking/gambling age, I consider myself very fortunate to be able to afford so many fine machines--I&#146ve driven everything from a Hummer to a Miata, and can say with some authority that no mainstream marque in the is more thoroughly fulfilling or consistently avant-garde as Audi. 

Manual transmissions are usually a must for me, but when I went to visit my good friends at the Audi/Mercedes showroom, I decided to give the much touted new CVT gizmo (Continually variable transmission) a try. Basically, this is an automatic transmission without gear ratios--they are infinitely variable, thus can optimize everything at the same time--the concept is a bit difficult to grasp, but it is essentially a mechanical marvel that apparently increases gas mileage and performance simultaneously. Adjusting to it was a bit strange at first, but it was extremely intuitive and unobtrusive&#151it lent a very sedate feeling to the engine, though. In the end, I didn&#146t opt for the CVT, since the 6 speed manual was geared (no pun intended) towards my tastes, and the option isn&#146t available with Quattro. As I said before, tastes vary wildly, and my tastes run towards the sporty end of the spectrum&#151I enjoy blowing musclecars away at stoplights and pushing my cars to their limits in the mountains&#151but if you don&#146t lean that way, the CVT would be a smart decision. Think of the money you&#146d save on gas! 

As a whole car, the A4 is much better and seriously more compelling than a 3-Series (and not just because the 3&#146s price tag is stratospheric compared to the Audi&#146s). A few things offset the differences, though: The dynamics of the 3 as a driver&#146s car are incredible--the A4 will hustle around curves with the same tenacity and even more fluidity, but the 3&#146s perfect weight distribution and rear drive character seem to be just a bit more natural. Don't tell anyone: but my girlfriend and I raced home when I bought this A4--I took the shiny new Audi, she took the Bimmer: I handily whipped her! I'll be the first in line when the new S4 V8 debuts! 

The brakes are absolutely stunning, and safety features abound. There are 8 airbags. 

A cruise down the boulevard or a curvy mountain switchback in this machine will make you feel rich. Open the moonroof, roll the windows down, and enjoy the breathtaking experience a wonderful car will give you. Eat Audi dust, SUV drivers. 

Any hip young person will tell you Audi is cooler than almost anything out there. Audi has no truck or SUV: go figure! 

UPDATE (01.13.2003): I'm ecstatic to report a completely trouble free break-in period--something that certainly can't be said about my girlfriend's new G35 Coupe! Within 2500 miles, both headlamp units had to be fully replaced, the navigation system had to be continually tinkered with by the dealers to eliminate an unknown gremlin, and tire wear has been significant on the left side. Teething problems, the dealer asserts continually! 

The Audi, on the other hand, has smiled politely while stylishly transporting the unfortunate G owner to and from point A and B. Impeccable job, once again. I do have two complaints, though: the exhaust note, I have noticed, is a tad more wimpy than I first noticed, but it's acceptable. I would prefer something with a trace more Italian basso-profundo and less German silent efficiency--brassy snarliness adds much to the driving experience. The other complaint stems from my doing. After I had stopped at Starbucks for a smooth Frappuccino, my driving got a little overtly zealous. After a 3-2 downshift leading into a s-bend on a canyon road en route to my neighborhood, I reached for the Frapp and spilled it on the console. No amount of attempted cleaning I did ever got any of the buttons unstuck (or the retractable cupholder)! I tried everything I knew wouldn't disrupt anything electrical underneath, and even resorted to scraping with toothpics for quite a time. I couldn't get the car into the dealer for more than two weeks, but they were understanding about the whole scene and had no reservations about replacing the exterior of the panel free of charge. I should have been more careful, but I imagine a rambunctious tyke could knock his mom's latte out of the cupholder just as easily as I did! Maybe it should be just a little more supportive, Audi? Everything is back to normal, and I even got a "hottie discount" (A free soy macchiato!) from a green haired babe at Starbucks that night. She said she was "diggin the sweet ride!"
