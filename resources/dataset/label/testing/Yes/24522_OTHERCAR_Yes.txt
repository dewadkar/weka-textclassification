            I bought the camera at buy.com and even got a $35 rebate on a 128MB compact flash card. Since the camera does not come with a rechargable battery or AC supply, I bought an extra battery and charger from bestbuy.com for $49. 

The camera is very compact, handles easily, and shoots great pictures. I could not find anything wrong with the intensive red coloration that many people describe. Then again, I let every picture go through Photoshop (Auto Level) before I print or store them. Battery life is a definitive con but I see that as a general trend in digital photography. 

I like that the 885 provides the Custom Shoot Mode (CSM) which is ideal for those out there who are photography savvy. The Scene mode optimizes shoots based on a particular environment - vert helpful. Finally the Auto mode allows simple point-and-shoot. A well rounded feature set overall.

HOWEVER! The buttons on the 885 are very fragile. For some reason, the joystick (left, right, up, down) stopped working properly. The right arrow is constantly pressed and makes navigation through the menu pretty difficult. I will try to get it under warranty but am heading off for a month where I need the camera. (Guess I should have just bought it at a local store).

Overall I am very pleased with the quality of the pictures. The features leave nothing to be desired and the handling of the camera is just great. Although I am disappointed with the button issue I have bought a case to prevent any further problems,
