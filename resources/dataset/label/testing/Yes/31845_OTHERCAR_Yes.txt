            I bought this car right before our first baby was born (we wanted a car with all the newest safety features).  Previously, I owned a VW Fox...another wonderful car, and the reason I became hooked on Volkswagens.  My Fox treated me wonderful, and I've always had great customer service at the VW dealer.  I've had my eye on the Passat for a couple years as my next car purchase, and I did a lot of research on it both in person and on the internet.
I love everything about this car, from the color of the instrument panel when it lights up at night, to the nice roomy trunk.  The interior is roomy, even the back seat.  The rear has 60/40 split, which has come in handy for me a few times.  I love how the key pops out of the remote, and the remote itself is wonderful for opening the trunk, and unlocking doors.  The stereo is great.  The ride is smooth, it corners well, and it has lots of power (of course, I have the V6).  I also love the new colors for 2000.  
Okay, I do have a couple pet peeves about the Passat...the cup holders being one.  In the front, anything larger than a soda can won't fit, and even a soda can is hard to get in and out (I have to rock it back and forth a couple times).  In the rear, the cup holders pop out directly over the hump in the middle, so it's difficult to find any cup that will stay in place.  Also, if I turn off the car, then open the door while the sunroof is closing, the sunroof stops in mid track.  I then have to re-insert the key to resume closing the sunroof.  Lastly, I discovered that VW doesn't tint windows.  I wished to have the 3 rear windows tinted so the baby wouldn't have direct sun on her face, but the option was not available.  They do, however, have a built in sunshade for the rear window that you can open or close to your liking.<br><br>
