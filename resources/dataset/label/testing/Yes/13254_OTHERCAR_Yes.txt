            The midsize sedan from Honda is definitely among the best of its class. It's a very well built car which I've only brought to the shop once. The charge was covered by the Accord's great guarantee though. Since then the car has run flawlessly.

The Accord EX should be classified as a luxury car. With leather seats, great climate control, remote entry, and power everything, this car feels like a million bucks! Not only that, but it handles like extremely well and every ride is a smooth one. The air bags are top quality and supposedly the safest available. The Accord EX comes as an automatic 4-speed. I'm not sure as to whether it is available with a stick shift or not. 

At around 300 a month to lease, the Accord is a great buy. It also gets very good mileage at around 23 miles on the highway, 17 miles on city streets. This will also keep your money in your pockets. 

While it's hard to imagine $300 a month can lease you a luxury sedan, it's true. The Accord is definitely a luxury car when fitted with all the options. The EX drives like a luxury car, and is definitely as comfortable as a luxury car. While it may not have as flashy of a name as BMW or Mercedes, it's quality is nearly as high.<br><br>
