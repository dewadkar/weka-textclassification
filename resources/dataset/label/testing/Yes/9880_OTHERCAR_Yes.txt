            Well, I should first off state that I simply TEST DROVE a Grand Am GT.  I currently drive a Sunfire and I'm really getting tired of the sleepy 4 cylinder engine.  I test drove a 4 door GT with cloth interior.  I can honestly say this car has some good "get-up-and-go" to it.  I immediately felt as though I had substantial engine power with the GT.  I could pull out into traffic moving 45mph + with ease and not fear that I would be run over (for those of you who have never experienced the fear associated with driving a sunfire..just take my word for it).  The car accelerated smoothly and never "bogged" beween gears or anything.  

Yet, as much as I was impressed with the speed aspect of the GT, I was disappointed with the "cockpit style" interior.  I AM DRIVING A CAR, NOT AN AIRPLANE.  While some people say the uniquely angled dash assists the driver, I found it made the front seat area feel overwhelming and crowded.  Everywhere I looked, there were orange and red little buttons glowing.  All of the window/door controls are on the door, then there's the angled dash, and the leather covered gearshift.  The interior color was black, and it made me feel like I was driving in the dark in a way.  Now, like I said, I only test drove this car, so I understand that this was only and IMPRESSION of the car, but nonetheless, it is my first impression.  

As for the seats, they were cloth, and pretty uncomfortable.  I looked for the lumbar adjuster (the thing that controls the bump in your seat back) the whole time I drove, only to find it when I pulled back into the dealership lot.  Even when I turned the adjuster to as deflated as it would go, there was still a huge bump behind my back.  Now, from what I understand, these things are supposed to be COMFORTABLE and not annoying.  So, unless my test car was broken or something, I didn't really appreciate that the lumbar bump would not completely go away if I wanted it to.

I am still strongly considering the Grand Am GT right now.  I just think I would like to test a car that was more what I had in mind - leather and 2 door.  Every little bit changes a car.  Yet, my major complaint is still that angled interior.  It makes me sort of annoyed just thinking about it... :)  Oh well, I guess first impressions say a lot..lets just hope second impressions make a difference too!
