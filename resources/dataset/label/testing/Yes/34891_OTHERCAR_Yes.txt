            I purchased this vehicle after months and months of research and consideration. The safety features, dual sliding doors, trunk space (I could live in there) and body style really attracted me to this vehicle. I love the way it drives and handles on the road. I love the electronically maneuverable driver seat. I love all the cup holders and storage places. Families of four or more should definately buy this vehicle. I drove three hours North to get delivery sooner than I would have gotten here. We have two girls ages 5 and 10mths. My 5yr old LOVES the van and wants to show all her friends!<br><br>
