                 Though I have completely converted to being a Nissan owner, I owned four Mirages in the past.   Okay that is not completely honest, actually I have owned three mirages and a Eagle Summit (which is the same car just different name).  It has been my experience that while they are not the best compact car there is, for the money they are reliable and okay to look at.

     My last Mirage was a 1995 model.  I traded it in last summer for my 99 Nissan Maxima (a good trade if I might say).  My last Mirage had a few issues, we just were in need of a large car.  As for the power, it did not have the peep that our Sentra has, but it would hold it's own.

     One of our biggest complaints is that the Mirage is not a distance car.  In other words, you do not want to drive around for any length of time in the Mirage over a couple hours.   The seats are not designed as well as one would hope for longer trips.   There were many occassions when my wife and I went on ten hour trips in the Mirage, and it would just about kill us.  Comfort is certainly an issue in this model.

     Mirages maintain their value on the same level as a domestic car of the same size and inital cost.  Would I own one again?  Possibly but I am pretty much a Nissan man now.  If I had a child would I let them learn to drive in it?  Yes I think that the Maxima is a fairly safe car.  I had a fender bender in a Wal-Mart parking lot one time  and my car only got a scratch while the other car (a Protege) did not fair nearly as well.   This car is great for a college student or young driver.  Enough power to go places, but not enough to get them in trouble.<br><br>
