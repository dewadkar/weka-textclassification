            I purchased my '93 del Sol, used, in 1995.  Five years later, I've yet to have it in the shop for more than my scheduled tune-up!  It's comfortable, great on gas (approx. 28hwy), and fun to drive.  

I bought this car while I was single and living at the beach.  I am now married, with a child, and living in the mountains.  I have snow tires on it for the season, but that's the biggest change I've had to make.  

Granted, it is not a family car, and I will be buying a new-to-me vehicle soon, but I'm intent on keeping my little Honda for solo jaunts to town.  

I paid a reasonable price for it (from a dealer, no less!), and the blue book value is fair, even with 125,000 miles on it.  And my mechanic says it will probably run for at least another 125,000!

It's a great commuter car, and a fantastic Sunday drive car.  Just as long as it's not your only car to transport more than 2 people.  

The leg and head room are more than adequate, and the trunk size always surprises the courtesy clerk who loads my groceries!  There is also extra storage behind the seats.  

All around, I say if you're considering this vehicle, you just can't go wrong.  Happy driving!!<br><br>
