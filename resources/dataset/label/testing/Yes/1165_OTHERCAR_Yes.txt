            	My boyfriend and I just decided to buy a new sporty car. I have always liked the look of a neon, so we decided to look at a few of them. We wanted to get a new model car but a used one.  There were only five cars to choose from so we went with the most recent made model. We went for a Hunter Green 2000 4 door Neon Sedan. The inside was beautiful!! It had tan cloth seats, seating compacity 5, Cassette Player, Power lock doors, Power windows, Driver and passenger airbags, Sunroof etc. When we test drove the car it drove like a champ. It had so much power and energy.
  After our wonderful drive we decided that this was the car for us. We went and put a down payment on the car and left happy. We got to pick the car up 2 days after all that. I was soooooo happy and excited. I was the one who drove it home! Before we left we checked out a few things. We got a basic 36 month warranty on the car. That was very important. 
  On our way home I felt so cool. I was driving in style! I felt very comfortable and safe. The car takes very good turns and has great pick up. This car handles very well. There is no noise or crunching sounds, It's a very smooth ride. When I got home I piled all my family in and we went for a cruise. Everyone loved it. 
   This car has got to be one of the best I have ever owned. We bought the car March 3rd 2001 and Today is May 1st 2001. We still have not had 1 problem. It's great on gas! I'm so happy we purchased this car. This beauty will be in the family for a while.
  Anyone who really loves a Nice sporty car should go and get themselves a Neon. They have got to be the best cars out there! It's a great size car for a small to medium size family. 
  I bough this car because we were in need of a new one. I really like the look and style of a neon. They are very sporty looking. The price for this year a model was great. We got this car for a used price of $10,000. There were only 20,000 miles on the car.
So we decided it was a great deal and we purchased it.
