            <b>Overview:</b>
2000 Altima SE Auto:
I bought this car used with 31,000 miles on it in Jan 2002. I had to take it to the shop twice. One time was for a tune-up which I found out afterwards, it didn't need (I'll get back to that a bit later). The second time, unfortunately, was because the electrical system cut out a couple of times including once while I was driving 50 mph on the highway. The service tech couldn't duplicate the problem enough to fix it and I ended up having to trade it in. Though my one problem was a major one, it seems to be a fluke.

<b>Quality</b>
Fairly powerful engine for the price. Lags a bit starting from the stop position. Decent mid-range torque. Pretty quiet but not like other family sedans. Exterior: Pseudo-sporty style contradicts actual power output; nice 103 in. wheelbase; Front Head Room: 39.4 in. is one of the taller mid-sizes out there; well thought out design. Interior: very high quality for the price range. Shocks do not have to be replaced for over 50k miles. Very low maintenance costs.

<b>Performance</b>
About par for a 2.4 liter inline 4 banger. 155 HP gets you on and off the highway alive. Feels sluggish at low gears and low RPMs but picks up nicely by the time you hit the mids. Handeling is actually surprisingly nimble for a mid-size under $20k. You won't hug any corners but you won't lose control either. Tight, 4-wheel independent-strut suspension is A bit stiff. 

<b>Comfort</b>
Low leg support make the front seats very uncomfortable on the long trips. Dash is well laid out with LCD odometer and dual trip meters (in white on the SE trim). Back seats are slightly cramped for 3 but adequate for 2 adults. Large windows and properly placed mirrors give an exceptional near-360 scanning perimeter. Noise drowns out stereo at higher RPMs.
