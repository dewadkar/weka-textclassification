            I have a 95 Toyota 4 runner SR5 with all the options. I driven or owned about every sports utility out there between my parents SUVs and works and mine. Compared to all the other SUVs, I love this one the most. I has the elegant look to it but the 3 feet of snow no problem feel and attitude. 


(Power) I have taken my 4 runner everywhere but true digging (extreme off road with mud holes that I seen swallow tanks). It�s been to the beach/ cape hatterius NC, which at some points it was out performing explorers and a Hummer. I can say this cause I pulled a hummer out of a sand pit. 
Now I think the Hummer was stuck more because of the driver than the SUV, but never the less the 4 runner had the ability to pull him out. 


(4x4 High/Low) I the only real snow storm the east coast got this year, I was out and about driving like a no limit soldier through 6 foot snow banks and 3 foot covered streets. If the ground was not covered in snow you�d think that it was a clear day and you where driving on pavement. 


(Room/comfort) The seating defiantly has a car feel to it, not like the explorers/bronco/Durango etc. Legroom is somewhat limited but you get used to it real quick. I back seat is far more suited for kids and smaller men/women because your knees are so high up, kind of like sitting on the edge of a fu-ton. The cargo space is perfect and includes 2 doors on either side great for storing oil/antifreeze/jumper cables etc.


(Speed) Even with the V6 engine your get up and go is limited. Lacks in get up like the Durango�s V8, sadly the jeeps straight 6 and Explorers V8 out perform it here. With my V6 I average 15 miles to a gallon and my parents 4 runner gets about 19-20, Mine is just tuned different for more power and has some after market performance gear to make up for the slow start. Happily, I can say that it like to cruise at 75-80 miles an hour.


The only problem I have had with it so far is that the rotors (deals with the front brakes) need to be turned, that was a problem with the Toyota trucks SUVs for 93-95.

All in ALL it had a beautiful appearance and can hold its own about everywhere but a Racetrack.
