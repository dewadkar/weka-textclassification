            There are quite a few things to watch out for. I have a 97 Jeep Wrangler SE, 4cyl, automatic, with a soft-top. First thing is Jeeps have a problem losing the manifold bolts. You might think you have an exhaust link, but in fact the manifold bolts loosened up or snapped off. This happened 8 times to me in four years. Jeep now realizes this is a problem and it is now covered under your emissions warranty, which is 8yrs or 80,000 miles. But it's a real pain having to service your Jeep approximately every six months. Let me tell you what work I have done so far. I bought my Jeep in April of 96. It has 72,000 miles. The first year I had the manifold bolts replaced 3 times. I also had to replace the catalytic converter because the honeycomb shattered in it. The second year I replaced the alternator and the oil-sending unit 2 times. And I had the manifold bolts replaced twice. The third year the oil-sending unit 4 times then I had the unit plus all the wiring replaced. That seemed to solve that problem. I had front calipers and rotors, the manifold bolts and the steering stabilizer bar. The fourth year, radiator had to be replaced. This was the most expensive part. The radiator was a dealer part and it costs $524. My husband did all the work so that figure is just for the part itself. Also you can not have it recored. Now the heating fan only works on the floor so that's next on the list. Another thing you need to know is that you will be going through windshields a lot. Because the windshield is almost straight up and down, when a rock flies up it is not deflected. You will notice that you will get a lot of bullseyes. My advice to you is to have these fixed at once this will save you tons of money considering a windshield will cost you about $400, and you can have it fixed for $20.
I have enjoyed driving a Jeep, although it is a pretty bumpy ride. If you have ever owned a convertible its not the same. I a convertible your hair is not blown allover the place, plus you are able to hear the person next to you speak. That is because the windshield is on an angle. But remember I told you that the windshield in a Jeep is basically straight up and down. Therefore when the top is down the air is blowing from behind you and you will need to scream in order for the person next to you to hear.
I am now trying to sell my Jeep because I just had a baby. A Jeep is not the safest vehicle for a baby in a car seat. Plus remember it only seats four. At the time I bought my Jeep, it was my two older kids and I. Now I got married a year ago and had a baby. So that makes five. If we want to go anywhere we need to take my Jeep and my husbands pickup. Just a reminder to think about where you are going to be in the next 6 years because it is going to take you that long to pay it off.
I hope this helps all of you who are considering purchasing a Jeep Wrangler. All in all it is a good vehicle. The total amount I have invested in the upkeep is about $2900. This isn't to bad when you spread it out over five years.
