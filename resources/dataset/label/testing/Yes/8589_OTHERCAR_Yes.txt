            We have the maxivan, 15 passenger with the 3.9L engine.  It has plenty of power, drives well and has lots of room.  We use for family trips.  Other than the minor issues below, we love this van!  3 kids and dog have plenty of room, even with the rear bench removed.

The dual A/C and heaters are a must and they work really well.  The folks in the way back get plenty of A/C or heat!

The BAD:

The last bench is a pain to get out.  It has 4 bolts that are easy to remove, but you need to remove the 3rd bench to make room to manipulate the last one out the rear door.  The other benches have release levers that make it easy to remove them.  No wrenches needed.  It is not clear to me why the rear bench is different than the rest.  Also, the bolts are left exposed, which sucks.

There is not enough leg room for me (6'2" guy).  There is a foot rest for your left leg on the wheel well which forces my knee to a near 90 degree angle.  Not good for long trips.  The passenger has a similar problem.

The mileage sucks too (12-15mpg), although for a 8 cylinder 5.9L engine, what do you expect?  I wish there was a rear windshield wiper, but this isn't a big deal.  Also, due to the size of this van, you will want to by some blind-spot mirrors as you can't see little cars right next you at all.  Lastly, the stereo is really low quality and will need to be replaced if you care about good quality sound at all.

OVERALL:

This was a great buy for me and my family.  I highly recommend the van, despite it's minor glitches.
