            The A4 1.8T sport sedan is an awesome driving machine! Its performance, styling, features and price enabled Audi to regain the North American market foothold they lost in the late 1980's due to the undeserved "runaway acceleration" fiasco.

This is my third Audi (actually, my wife's second). The first, a new 1985 5000S sedan, was plagued with problems, and I tossed it when the warranty expired. The second was a pre-owned 1993 Audi 90CS sedan, the successor to the 4000 and predecessor of the A4. Reliability was slightly improved, but all 90s had a major issue with the AC evaporator core that, after about 4 years, required replacement - a $1200 hit to the bankroll!

The A4 has been far more trouble-free than the other two, but apparently the AC evaporator is still a problem area for Audi. Now that the factory warranty is gone, I face a choice - buy a $1200 extended warranty, or sell the little demon before the AC goes!

Otherwise, we both are crazy about this car. It's somewhat plain looking inside, but the austere environment is pure German functionality. Occupants are not coddled by the A4 - they are merely tolerated. It's almost as if the car is determined to do its job the way it deems proper, despite the fact that it requires direct driver input. The payoff is not gratuitous creature comfort, but a truly rewarding driving experience.

The 20 valve, 150 hp turbocharged engine rocks! It is very well balanced and loves to rev. It's a bit doggy below 2500 rpm (you're not gonna chirp the tires off the line). But turbo boost takes over at that point and pushes you back in the seat all the way up to redline! The solid, short-throw shifter and well-spaced gearing actually makes driving fun on Houston's stop-and-go freeways.

Handling is dead stable, and suspension action is amazingly tight, quick and responsive, owing to the $800 sports package that includes wide 16 inch wheels / tires and lowered ride height. A twitch of the beefy, leather covered steering wheel produces instant directional change, and there is never a hint of body roll or dive. High speed braking is very straight and predictable, and the big 4-wheel discs halt forward motion in a hurry. The downside is they have an "adhesive" feel that makes them somewhat difficult to modulate.

The feature list is good, and includes automatic climate control (but why no "off" switch?), AM/FM cassette (but why no CD player?), full instrumentation with analog clock and red back-lighting, tilt / telescoping steering wheel, front and rear fog lights, one-touch up / down windows, heated electric mirrors and split fold-down rear seat. Fit and finish are impeccable, and switchgear action is tight, smooth and tactile. Although leather wasn't available on this model, the perforated vinyl closely matches the look and feel of real hides. It's just that the wonderful aroma is missing.

So, what's not to like? For starters, the seats tend to be a little flat and unyielding, although sufficiently grippy. The stereo system has sound quality that is thin and lacks adequate base response. The AC system works well until outside temps reach the 90s. At that point, it really labors to maintain the pre-set temperature. The cup holder is idiotically positioned under the driver's right elbow. It is impossible to reach and cannot be used with the center armrest down. As for the armrest, it is attached to the seat where the driver's lumbar support adjustment should go, if there was one! Rear seat room is intimate, to say the least, but this is a sport sedan after all.

The A4 1.8T is a slick, go-fast toy that any true driving enthusiast should experience. Driving it is a real head-rush if you stay involved with the shifter and keep the revs up! But the prospect of long-term ownership is scary unless you don't mind big repair bills.

UPDATE June 1, 2002

I no longer have to worry about the A4's long-term reliability. It unofficially bit the dust two weeks ago!! My wife was rear-ended in a real and meaningful manner by a Jaguar XK. Miraculously, she (wife) was only shaken up, but the car appears to be totaled. Hopefully, the insurance adjuster will take the realistic position that there is no practical way to rebuild it. [[I was notified at 6:00 pm CST 06/03/02 that it was declared a total loss.]]

Damage was extensive from the rear bumper forward to the sunroof - the trunk floor was crushed, the C-pillars exhibited sharp bends at the roofline, the roof panel sported wrinkles at the trailing edge of the sunroof, the rear seatbacks were pushed forward, and the driver's seatback collapsed into the rear passenger compartment. One of the doors could not be opened, and the other three, once open, could not be closed.

From a safety perspective, I'm less than pleased with the performance of the passenger safety cage. On the other hand, I suspect that the Jag was traveling 40mph or better at impact, so the deformation of the passenger compartment isn't totally unexpected. And the wife DID walk away from it, which pretty much sums up everything.

Not too surprisingly, she insists on replacing the car with another A4!! That will make three Audi's in a row for her - an unquestionable recommendation of the brand.

UPDATE June 10, 2002

It's done! There's now a new A4 3.0 Quattro 6-Speed in the Garage, and we both are so nutz about it that we can't look at it without smiling. Such a huge advance over the departed '98!! Review to follow after break-in!
