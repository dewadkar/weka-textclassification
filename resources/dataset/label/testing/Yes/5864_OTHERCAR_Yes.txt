            If you are looking for a used car (I was), give the 2001 TL a hard look.  With 46k miles (off-lease), this car runs like a dream.  The interior is still crisp, tight, and working perfectly.  The outside lines have held their style, and the drive performance is still on-target.  There's a lot of power in this car, and she just seems to get better with age.

In looking for a car, I was evaluating several factors, but mainly price and reliability (which is related to lifetime price).  It came down to the TL and an ES 300, but given that the ES was several thousand more and lacked the features of the TL, it was a no-brainer.  Besides, Honda and Toyota, in my humble opinion, have the same reliability factor.

The TL, with heated seats and mirrors and the automanual transmission, was a clear winner.  Also, while I loved the ES' quiet ride and smooth road feel, I personally wanted a bit more "bite" to my drive.  The TL has a bit more spunk, and really chews up the NorCal twisty roads.

A final note is that I found a model with the DVD navigation system.  While I am a bit impatient to get the update (delayed for now due to re-programming by the manufacturer), I love the system.  Compared to a brand-new nav system, it's a bit unpolished, but it does a wonderful job and gets you door to door quickly, intelligently, and is fully adjustable to your preferences.  

The interior, as I mentioned above, is still in great shape.  While the control stalks feel a bit flimsy, they continue to perform well, and the rest of the controls are still crisp and responsive.  The sound system is fine, and the car is quiet at high speeds- no squeaks or rattles at all.  

Handling is top notch, and I always feel in control, even on these crazy CA highways.  The car is responsive at high speeds (for passing and maneuvering), and feels nimble yet solid at the same time.  It's a pleasure to make the 60 minute commute each day.  Seat heaters and mirror heaters (worth their weight in gold when you need them) round out the package.

In short, this is a reliable, fun, comfortable car that delivers amazing value to the used buyer.  You get more than what you pay for, and since it's a Honda, you know that it will run for ever.

One final note: there are MANY Acura fan sites out there.  Highly recommended to go through them- there are so many tips, tricks, and fixes that you can answer most of your questions without having to schlep to the dealer.
