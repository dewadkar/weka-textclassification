            I bought a champagne-colored Ford Contour LX with the V6 Duratec engine back in November 1995.  Five years later, the loan is paid off, and the car still runs like the day I bought it. There are many monikers for FORD (Fix Or Repair Daily being the most over-used) but the 1995 Contour LX transcends that stereotype.

Above all other options, the V6 engine is a must, the 4-cylinder simply doesn't have enough pep for a car of this size, and the added performance of the V6 is too good to pass up.  I won't bore you with horsepower or torque, because I simply don't know what that really means to the common car shopper, but let's just say that you can press the accelerator with confidence on the Contour with the V6 in any tight situation.  The engine is smooth and quiet even on 87 Octane gasoline (recommended by Ford), and the automatic transmission is very responsive.  The ride of the Lx is very smooth, even on bumpy roads, and while the handling is not like that of a BMW or Volkswagen, it wasn't meant to be.  The outside appearance of the Contour is very similar to that of the Mazda 626.  The Contour's sister is the Mercury Mystique.  The interior is very roomy, with a cab-forward design that gives a lot of headroom in the front seat.  The rear seats are a little tight but adequate enough to fit two rear-facing infant car seats or a full-sized toddler seat.  Three adults could fit in the back with a little intimacy.  

The Lx model has interior lights on the dash and the front passenger doors that cast an eerie green glow, but looks nice, especially in the dark.  Unfortunately, these very same lights get a little hot to the touch, something that must have been a design flaw in this first of the Contour series. The 1995 Ford Contour has also had several recalls, although I never would have noticed any of them if the factory hadn't sent me the letter, so be sure if you buy one that they've already been attended to.  You can expect anywhere from 22 to 32 miles per gallon in the city and highway respectively.

In summary, if you are looking for a family sedan for a low price without sacrificing power and comfort, look to the 1995 Ford Contour Lx.  While not flashy or one that will standout in a crowd, the Lx will provide you with a reliable vehicle that is loaded with value.  I bought this car new in 1995 for $15,000, but I recently had it appraised at CarMax for $3,000.  Look to pay between $2,000 and $3,500 depending on the miles driven.<br><br>
