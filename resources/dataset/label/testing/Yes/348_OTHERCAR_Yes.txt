            My mom decide that her Ford Mustang was just the completely wrong type of car for her, so she decide to buy an SUV. After some research, she took an approach towards the 2000 Nissan Xterra. I went along with her to the dealer. The salesmen were rather nice, and less pushy than others that I have met. The dealer price on the Xterra was around $28,000. My  mom decide that she would trade her Mustang and pay $18,000 cash for the difference. The dealers didn't like the idea at first, but after some haggling, they agreed on it. 
The Xterra is great! It feels like a ride on a magic carpet because it is so smooth. The seats are comfortable and the interior looks great. From the passenger's point of view, the stadium seating is a brilliant idea. While sitting in the back seats, you can see just as much as if you were riding shotgun. Not only is the interior nice looking, but the outside appearance is very pleasing to the eye. The equipment storage rack on the roof ads a nice touch. The only thing that could possibly fend away a possible customer would be the relatively low gas mileage for a 6-cylindar vehicle(15MPG). We haven't had any problems with it yet, and we do not look forward to it. I would definently recommend the 2000 Nissan Xterra to anyone in the market for SUVs.<br><br>
