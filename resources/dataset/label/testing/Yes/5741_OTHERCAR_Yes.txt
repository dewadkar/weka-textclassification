            Pentax introduced the Optio 330 around the middle of last year and have had much better luck with it then their previous digital cameras.  At the price point that the Optio 330 sits at it is an extremely competitively priced camera that offers a wealth of options for your money.

<b> What's Included </b>

Like most digitals, the Optio includes the following standard accessories:

-16MB CF Card (This is kind of nice, the majority of digitals in this resolution range come with 8MB Cards)
-USB Cable
-Audio/Video Cable
-Viewing and Photo-editing software (both Win and Mac compatible)
-The camera
-Wrist strap
-Li-Ion battery and Charger


<b> The Camera </b>

The Optio 330 is an extremely small camera that rivals the APS Elph2 camera in dimensions and size.  But don't let it's small size deceive you.  The Optio packs a 3x optical zoom as well as a 3.34 megapixel CCD which allows for quality prints up to an 8x12.  For those creative photographers out there, one has the option of controlling all of the settings, or to let the camera do all the work for them.  

Two features that distinguish the Optio 330 from other digitals though are its ability to allow one to take multiple exposures on a single frame ( up to 16 ) as well as a light meter that overlays itself on the current image in the viewfinder to help ensure a properly exposed shot.  A good number of digital cameras offer this option after you have taken the shot but Pentax has taken this one step further giving one extra assurance that they are indeed going to have a properly exposed shot.  The majority of most people won't use this feature but nonetheless it is a handy one.

The multiple exposure option is a nice touch for those who connect their digital cameras directly to their printer.  Instead of having to do all of that work using Adobe or some other photo-editing software they can create some professional looking shots with the camera itself!  This being said, the Pentax is DPOF compatible so for those who prefer to skip the having the computer in between the camera and the printer, the Optio 330 is up to the task.


<b> Picture Quality </b>

The lens on the Optio is consistent with the quality that one should expect from any high-end Pentax point and shoot camera.  However because of the small size, it is not quite as sharp as some of the other 3.34 megapixel cameras out there, some examples being the Canon S30 and the Olympus 3020Z.  There is a bit of barrel distortion at the wider angle settings as well as the telephoto focal lengths, however this again, is something that is not likely to be noticed by most people unless they are specifically looking for it.  
Color reproduction is fairly accurate with no discernible bleeding of colors when taking shots of scenes with many different subjects.  All in all, an excellent lens, as it has been closely rated to the Olympus 3020, and Canon S30.  While shooting with the camera at its highest resolution one can easily obtain a beautiful photo quality 8x10 or 8x12.

<b> The Good and the Bad </b>

The LCD Display.  If one were to take the Coolpix 885 or the Canon S30, one would find that both the displays on both those cameras are much sharper then that of the Pentax.  Although this has no bearing on the quality of the picture when you print it out, it does take away from the shooting experience, as you will probably find yourself looking a little harder at the display then you would like to.  I found that it tended to be a little on the darker side, and when composing shots in bright lighting it tended to make the subjects looked washed out.

Despite this, the metering system of the Optio does a terrific job, and when set on the auto setting, one will not have to worry about their pictures being improperly exposed.  The automatic white balance does a resonably well job of compensating for different lighting conditions but I would have to say that the metering systems of the Nikon, Olympus, and Canon cameras definitely have an edge.

As mentioned in the Pros above, one thing that I really like about the Optio is it's relatively quick autofocus.  When compared to that of the other 3.34 megapixel cameras, the Optio seems to have the fastest autofocus.  When the shutter is depressed there is also very little shutter lag which makes the Pentax a fairly good camera for "quick" subjects.

<b> Conclusion </b>

All in all the Pentax is a terrific camera, but in my opinion it is not the best choice out of the available choices out there.  If in the market for a 3.34 megapixel camera the three main cameras that I would suggest looking at are the Coolpix 885, Canon S30, and the Olympus 3020Z.  

However, if on a budget, the Pentax is the one to pick as Pentax provides you with everything you need to get started.  The only other accessories that you will ever need with the Optio are perhaps additional memory, and a small carrying case.  Although the Olympus 3020Z is similarly priced, one will still need to purchase a good set of rechargeable AA batteries to power the camera.  

If you are in the market for a small, compact 3.34 megapixel camera, take a look at the Optio 330.  It may be love at first sight, and the Optio will prove to be a very capable, reliable, companion.

Like always, if you have any questions about the camera, please feel free to e-mail me.  And if you are interested, I have written reviews on other digital cameras such as the Canon S40 (which is extremely similar to the S30), Canon G2, and Sony DSC-F707.  Just click on my id and you can access my reviews from there.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, and please rate my review as I appreciate knowing whether or not is has proved helpful.
