            SIMPLY THE BEST CAR WE HAVE EVER OWNED. 

One of the nicest things I ever did for my wife was to replace her aged Mercury Tracer hatchback with a 1994 Mistubishi Diamante LS.  This was in 1998.

After a good 2 hours of haggling with Max Madsen Mitsubishi in Downers Grove, IL, I got the car for $12,000.00 out the door, tax title and docs...not a penny more.  It had 68,000 miles on it at the time.  To this day I am sure I got a good deal.  We got a warranty to boot. Not bad.

LOOKS:
Once you get accustomed to the weird looking grill and headlight design, the car really stands out.  I think it is very handsome.  The paint is great, and always shined when washed.  Wheels were the premium mags, and they looked great.  From about 15 feet away, it has the silhouette of maybe a BMW 700 series, and about the same size, too.  Really sophisticated, strong and reserved.  

BODY:
The car has always been solid.  The doors sound like Cadillac doors, when you shut them.  Nice and heavy. The whole car truly feels like a single moving part.  The only complaint I had was that the hydraulics on the trunk failed early on...but they can be replaced inexpensively, I think.

PERFORMANCE:
230 Horsepower is pretty good, even in 2002.  This car is fast but not overly intimidating.  My wife, who I bought thie car for, is no speed racer.  However when we're out on the open road, more often than not, she's edging up on 90-100 mph and the engine is hardly breathing.  On the other hand, my Mazda 929, which has a similar engine, only generates 170 HP, and really feels like it is being stressed at those speeds.  Handling is very good, not great.  This is not a car that needs to be a top handler, though.  If your other car is a Corvette, you may be disappointed.

RELIABILITY:
We have no complaints here.  When we first got this car, we noticed that the driver side door was sagging perhaps 1/4 inch.  We brought it back to the dealer and they fixed it for free.  At 110,000 miles the engine started to burn about a quart of oil every 2,000 miles.  Not a big deal really, as long as you remember to keep an eye on it.  We never have had to replace the exhaust.  I noticed that the front-passenger side tire was wearing unevenly, so I brought it to a tire store.  The manager told me that Diamantes from 1994 and 1995 came from the factory with a slight "toe-in" alignment problem, and that the uneven wearing was common with this car.  Solution: 4 wheel alignment for $79.95.  No problems ever since.  

FEATURES:
Top of the heap.  Leather seats, power drivers seat, power door locks, power windows, automatic rear-view mirror dimmer, memory position drivers seat, AM/FM/TAPE and 6-CD changer in the trunk, power antenna, Stereo controls in the steering wheel, premium 6 speaker Infinity sound system, cruise control, heated mirrors, anti-lock braking system, passenger and driver front impact air-bags, cold a/c, analog clock, cup holders, remote starter and theft deterrent system, and premium wheels.  Did I forget anything? 

OUR SAD STORY:
On October 2nd, 2002, my wife had a minor fender-bender.  She was driving no more than 10-15 mph and rear-ended a Toyota Camry straight-on.  The other driver had slammed-on his brakes for no reason, although they both had the right of way.  What can you say; it happens.  There was no visible damage to the Camry, while in the Diamante, the minor collision caused both airbags to deploy.  This was interesting because the front bumper on our Diamante barely showed any damage either!  So maybe there were faulty sensors or triggers in the Diamante? Anyhow, the airbags popped and my wife was black and blue from being air-bagged.  The passenger-side air-bag blew out the windshield.  Long story longer: The insurance company decided that the cost to repair this car exceeded its apparent street value, and instead of letting us keep the car, we were forced to junk it.  Which was terrible!  We love this car!!! After much grieving, we bit the bullet and I began looking for another car.  Starting with, 1994 and 1995 Mitsubishi Diamante LS.  I found maybe half-a-dozen within 50 miles of our home, near Chicago.  The most expensive was $6.995.00! The cheapest was $2,995.00!!!  I couldn't believe it.  We settled on a 1995 LS model with fewer miles than our crashed car had, and all of the features, and better (less worn after years of use) interior than we had. Basically we traded up at NO cost to ourselves.  The $5,000.00 check from the Insurance adjuster paid for the car, tax title and docs and everything, and we have the same but better car than we had previously.  

When my Mazda 929 goes, I am seriously considering getting myself another Mitsubishi Diamante LS, from 1994 to 1995, with low miles.  

TOTALLY UNRELATED:
I just found out that Mitsubishi is hoping to make the World's largest salt manufacturing plant, somewhere near Panama.  The problem is that it would be at a known grey-whale birthing ground, that would decimate the world's grey whale population.  So, I don't think I'll ever buy a NEW Mitsubishi, unfortunately.
