            We needed a new car.  We both know that gas prices are only going up.  Hybrids are fairly a new thing, and they run in the small size.  Hybrids also are only designed for cities, as their efficiency decreases on the highway.  Plus, I never seem to hear about how much those batteries cost once replacement time arrives.  We live in a remote, REMOTE, location, so traffic wasn't the issue, mileage was.  The TDI is time tested technology and design.  I'm certain that I will get 200k miles out of a TDI engine.  

Well, we bought a blue jetta wagon in February, and now there is over 13,000 miles on it.  Here's what others should know:

Fifty miles per gallon.  We live on mountain roads.  Up and down, left and right.  We get about 50 mpg consistantly.  Of course the dealer told us that the car can get 55-56 mpg, but since we don't live in interstate, great plains-land, 50mpg is the scene.  Yes there are tanks where we get 48, 49, or 51 mpg.  Last fill up was studded tire, 20 mph snow driving, and we got a disappointing 43 mpg.  But that's winter.  While on the topic, we haven't had any problems starting the car in cold temps, nor have we added any winter additives, save half of the complimentary pint of goo we were given at the dealership.  Perhaps we will if it gets to five degrees or below.

Ninety horsepower engine.  That's plenty.  In fact I can leave it in fifth gear going up Dixie pass (a steep mountain grade in the area).  Now, sometimes I do shift it, pending how fast I'm going, snow, etc., but the car can get up and go!  I'm not a hp-fanatic, and I do own a 80 hp, 5000 pound vanagon brick, so there you have it on bias, but I bet most people will feel this TDI will have plenty of zip, especially if fuel economy is their goal.

It's small.  Now, we are not disappointed in this vehicle, and if we had to do it again, we would buy this car, but the main, if not only reason for buying the Jetta TDI is mileage, and that it's the largest VW with a TDI available in 2003.  There isn't much else out there for efficiency.  And so, a big complaint is that VW doesn't put the TDI in the Passat (larger car) for N. America.  We frequently fold down the rear seats.  It is not a fun thing to do.  We find ourselves always cussing about them.  The front seats must not be fully back if the rear seats are to be folded down. I have already cracked some plastic around the rear seat latch when trying to fold the seat back to the down position.  That wouldn't have happened if I took the time move the front seat slightly forward.  Still, why should modern car manufacturers design anything not so user friendly?  After all, Volkswagen vehicles are not inexpensive!

My second complaint is the comfort level of the leather seats is horrid.  We have maxed-out the lumbar support on these seats, yet we need much more than what the seat offers.  The seat warmers are great, but for any trip for more than an hour (which is almost every time we get into the car) the seats become uncomfortable.  We chose leather due to the lighter color, as other cars available to us only came in black, which isn't a smart choice if you live in the desert.  The leather option came with radio controls on the steering wheel, which is nice, but doesn't add any comfort to the seats.  I keep hoping the seats will "break-in", but it doesn't seeming to be improving.   The steering column is adjustable, with the up and down, in and out variances, but wheel doesn't seem to come out enough for my comfort.  Despite the physical discomfort, the economical comfort at the seldom seen gas pump does help to alleviate some.

Our windshield wiper fluid reservoir did develop a leak in the first month of ownership.  The pump was replaced under warranty.  This tank does NOT hold a complete gallon of washer fluid, despite what we were told at the dealership.  Around 13k, the screw/fastener came out of the sunvisor.  There's a squeak in the foot rest, but only if I move my foot up and down.

We live 1.5 miles down a washboard gravel road.  There's an annoying squeak in the dash when driving over jarring bumps.  But that's our scene. It is a diesel, so there is a louder ride.  It would be nice for a quieter interior, but it's not bad.  The diesel is probably just as loud at an idle as it is doing 20mph.  I think that's a trait of a diesel, but how would I really know, having never owned one before.  By the way, the glow plug light goes off quick enough and doesn't really hamper our start-up time.

I've changed the oil myself the second time around.  This involved some extra work of removing plastic covers on the top and bottom of the engine. Some specific tools are needed, such as torx-head bits.  Not bad though.  I still haven't figured out how to drain the water from the fuel filter water separator.  The engine compartment is idiot-proof, as everything is black, except for the well-marked typical access items.  Nobody will have problems finding the very obvious oil dipstick! 

Although the ground clearance isn't quite what I would call adequate, the car negotiates mountain and gravel roads with comfortable control.  We had studded tires put on for this winter, and it now really does well in snow! We really like the spare tire storage area for keeping gloves, tire chains, frisbees, whatever.  I wonder how it will like a canoe on top this spring?

Everything except oil changing instructions (a standard neglect) is found in the thick manual, neatly stored in a fuzzy glovebox.  Oh, and despite my "oooohs" over the sleek, ejecting cupholder, it isn't so userfriendly.  It takes two hands to get all but the skinny cups into the clamps. 

Oh, and it's safe.  There are airbags everywhere, autolocks, nice keyless entry features, and other things that should accompany a $21k car.  Moonroof works great. There's subtle anti-theft for car and radio features too.
