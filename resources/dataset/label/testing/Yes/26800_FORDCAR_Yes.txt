            I have to admit, I have always been a Mustang guy. I like the way they look, the way they drive etc. But, that said the six-cylinder mustang does not excite me for the price. I took a test drive in a pitch black 2003 SVT ZX5 Focus and could not wipe the grin off my face before the dealer saw it. It had a three thousand dollar rebate and a six-disc in dash changer. It also is the exceptionally fun to drive. I am a motorcycle enthusiast and the SVT Focus on a curvy road revving the inline four with the supple six-speed is a unique experience. Cautionary signs that say 30 mph turn are instantly turned into 60 mph turns with the steering, braking and transmission. On the downside, anything more than the most conservative shift patterns steal gas like there is a hole in the tank. But for the hour after work, where I find the curviest road out there, it is worth it. The 170 hp inline four pumps out good power. It isn't a straight line burner, but in the twisties with the proper use of the six-speed transmission, there are very few cars under $40,000 that will keep up with it.

About the interior. I like it. My wife owns a 2002 VW Beetle and I wish Ford had done something a little niftier with the nighttime gauges and such but I think the build quality is solid and the seats are comfortable. I have the optional cold weather package and if you have never experienced heated seats in the dead of winter, I hope you will soon. This car, with the exception of the gas mileage is the closest thing to the kind of fun you experience on a motorcycle, while having trunk room and rear-folding seats.
