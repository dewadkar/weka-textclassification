            Me and my wife purchased a 93 Previa which has 88K miles on the odometer.  This is the first Japanese vehicle that we had ever owned and I've been totally loyal to U.S. Automakers.  After a terrible experience with a Pontiac Montana then a Chevrolet Astro.  We purchased the used Previa.
We were a little aprehensive to purchase this vehicle used & with 88K miles.  We did have some minor problems with the vehicle a leaking rear pinion seal, a leaking a/c system which was due to a seal leaking around the air drier.  Other than that a flawless vehicle.  
Me and my family took a trip from Cincinnati, Oh to Dallas, Tx with the entire van loaded down with the wife and myself plus our three kids.  We had a carrier on top of the van with about 200lbs of luggage due to we ran out of room inside the vehicle with all of our junk.  The van did superb and maintained a constant speed of 75mph.  The van also received an average gas mileage of 23 on the hwy.  
Me and the family are very happy with this vehicle but the only downside is the engine could be more powerful which was taken solved on 94 models with an optional super charger.
I would highly recommend this vehicle and I'm a new lifelong Toyota owner
