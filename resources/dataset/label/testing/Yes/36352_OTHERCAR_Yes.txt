            My second car ever was a Honda CRX which we still have today.  It is a 1987 and is running great so I knew Honda's were good cars.  

We had a Ford Mustang also when our daughter was born and talk about a tight squeeze.  Not to mention the fact that the door handles fell off and the window didn't roll down right.  Or the fact that my husband spent every weekend working on this car.  

When our daughter was 4 months old we searched for a new car.  We kept coming back to the Honda Accord which we ended up purchasing and I have to say we made a great choice.  It is by far the best.  

We have plenty of room for our family (although we will have to get a Honda SUV if we have a very large family. There is plenty of trunk space as well.

The best think is its Honda quality.  Everyone said, &quot;don't buy a foriegn car, the parts are too expensive&quot;.  Well, maybe, I don't know because our Honda's don't break!  They are great cars!  <br><br>
