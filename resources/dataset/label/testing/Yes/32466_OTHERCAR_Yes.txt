            I picked up my 1994 GP a little over two years ago, after my previous car (a BMW) kicked the bucket. It seemed like a nice car then and it's proved to be a good buy for me. Never been dissatisfied.

This model is one or two design changes back from the way the GP looks now, but I always preferred this style over the newer ones anyway, so that wasn't a problem. Mine has pretty much a standard package: automatic transmission, AM/FM cassette, A/C, cruise control, power windows and the regular 3.1 L engine that was used on the GPs of the time.

One thing that surprised me when I got the car (in 9/99) was that it handled nearly as well as the old BMW did, which I didn't expect at all. It doesn't brake as well, but it's satisfactory and better than most domestic models that I've driven, including some later models.

The radio leaves a lot to be desired; for one thing, it won't work with a CD player adapter. The A/C is great, which is a good thing considering I live in the South. I even used it a few days ago (!) when it got into the 80s here in December. The heat, defrost and rear defogger are all good, the dashboard controls are easy to read and come with a red light that doesn't mess up your night vision. I appreciate that because this car is on the road a lot of nights.

The 3.1 engine isn't [i]quite[/i] as powerful as I wish it was, but it's OK. As I said before, the car handles great on sharp curves or going through mountain roads, but where it really excels is out on the highway, where it runs quietly, quickly and at 30-35 mpg. In the city, this car can suck up gas like a Cadillac, though--probably no more than 10 mpg, tops, on a ride through the city of Raleigh.

The documentation I have with the car says it was sold on 11/29/93, so it's now more than eight years old. It had 81,000 miles when I got it, and 113,000 now, having recently completed a 1,009-mile trip from suburban Raleigh to middle Tennessee and back. Handled that trip like a dream, and in fact, the only major repair I've had in two years with this car was when the brakes went bad last year. Turned out they should have been replaced long before that, so it's not a knock on the car, and it was back on the road in a day.

The car has a roomy interior and lots of trunk space, as my fellow reviewers attest to and which I concur with. The seats have help up great for eight years of service and so has the exterior. You'd never know how old the car was from looking at the outside.

All in all, this is the best car I've ever owned.
