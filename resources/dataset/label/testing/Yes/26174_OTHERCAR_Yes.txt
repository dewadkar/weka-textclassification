            My husband bought this car for me as an early wedding present three weeks ago.  When I first saw it, I thought, "What am I going to do with this?"  I already have a 1968 Barracuda Notchback Coupe, a GMC Jimmy SLT and an Isuzu I-Mark, what do I need with a fourth rig?  Let me tell you,I found a use for her.  We live 45 miles from where we both work and like to rotate the cars to keep excessive mileage to a minimum on all.  Suffice it to say that the highway between work and home is not a straight line and I have left many a black mark on the asphalt from nearly doubling speed limit signs in my VII.  This is a cross between a Town Car and one vicious Mustang.  Although the folks at the car lot where my husband works call "Shelby" a glorified Thunderbird, they haven't taken her the places that I have, nor have they really driven her. This is the first luxury car I have ever owned. Example: I didn't know that the parking brake automatically releases itself once you put the car in gear and I spent nearly 20 minutes that first day trying to find in the owner's manual where the brake release handle was! Duh. Shelby doesn't possess the boat-float feel the bigger Town Cars and DeVilles do, either. She's very tight and out-corners my 'Cuda.  This car, despite her age, still turns heads. One of my clients even offered to buy her from me for twice what my husband paid.  Elegance and sport yet a car a cop only glances at mildly.  If he only knew what this car was capable of.  I would buy another one in a second!  Thanks.  Shauna Moore
