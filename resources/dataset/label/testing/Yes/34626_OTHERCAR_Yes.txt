            I needed a 4 wheel drive because where I work they have never heard of closing for SNOW -  - no matter how deep it gets.  Last week for example we had to push cars out of the parking lot.  (Image 7 girls knowing nothing trying to help a guy).  Took quite a long time for us.  
I owned a Ford Explore Limited and when it rained I was afraid.  I did not feel that I had any control of the big vehicle at all.  
With my new &quot;sporty&quot; AWD car I have been to work every time it has snowed.  This car is the easiest car to handle and you have so much control.  The only cons that I have seen is the dealership where I bought my car was fast to sell but they don't seem to want to help when you have questions. 
This is a great car and I love the heat warmers as we women know how cold leather can be in a dress.
