            When my first car broke down, I was crushed.  I loved that car, and it had it's own personality.  I also felt betrayed, and was uncomfortable with buying another older car because I didn't want the same thing to happen - but since I was only 17 I certainly couldn't afford a new car.  After a lot of shopping around I decided on a red <b>Pontiac Grand Am SE 4-door Sedan</b>.  

Now, over a year later, I am still very happy with my decision.  I paid <b>$6000</b> for the car with <b>57k miles</b> on it, and also got a warrantee from the dealer.  Fortunately, I haven't needed to use this warrantee, because nothing major has gone wrong with the car.  In the 15 months that I have had the car I've put 18k miles on it, so the car definitely receives it's fair share of wear and tear. 

<b>Minor Problems I've encountered with the car:</b>

<i>Oil Light</i> - The oil light on the car is extremely sensitive.  Usually within 3-4 weeks of getting an oil change the light will begin to blink occasionally.  Luckily all you have to do is pour a little more oil in and it will be happy for a few more weeks.  If you don't though, the oil light will start appearing more frequently, and become annoying.

<i>Gas Gauge</i> - The gas gauge on the car is not very accurate.  It will stay on full forever, and then when it reaches 3/4 it really is only half full and at 1/4 of a tank it is really almost empty.  I've heard other people complain about this problem as well.  It really isn't that big of a deal though, as long as you aren't the type of person who likes to see how long they can drive around on Empty.  Personally I like to keep my car above half a tank, just in case.

I also had to bring it in because the glove compartment leaked, but the dealer was able to pin point the leak, and quickly patch it up, so that wasn't much of a problem... Except that my registration is now soggy and water stained.

<b>The Grand Am's Strong qualities:</b>

<i>Great gas mileage</i> - This car is great on gas.  Personally I get about 23-26 miles to the gallon - mostly highway miles.  With the rising price of gas lately, this is a major plus in my book.

<i>It's not an Economy Car</i> - My mother owns a '96 Pontiac SunFire, and having driven both her car and my car, I would personally rather the older Grand Am.  Since it is in a higher class of cars it is a much smoother ride.  It is also better built, quieter, and more reliable - even though it is three years older, and I paid much less. 

I love my '93 Grand Am SE, and I definitely will consider buying another Grand Am, when the time comes.
