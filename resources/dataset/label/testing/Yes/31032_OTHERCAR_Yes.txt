            I purchased my 200SX-SER when it came on the market in '95.  As a recent college grad w/ little $$ but craving (finally) a new car of my own, I originally set my sights on an Acura Integra.  When  I compared options INCLUDED in the very low price (like power locks, sunroof, mirrors &amp; windows, sunroof, spoiler, sound system, etc.)to the Integra &amp; Honda Civic, all of these &quot;options&quot; were extras w/ Integra &amp; really added up!  The 200SX-SER really gives quite a bang for the buck!  It's sporty &amp; sleek, not to mention fast (standard shift is the way to go).  I've had my Nissan for almost 5 yrs. &amp; I still love driving it.  

It's extremely reliable &amp; has needed no work (aside from oil changes). However I've also been impressed w/ Nissan's service &amp; warranties when I've used their services.   I'll look to buy another Nissan when my beloved 200SX is retired.    

As a young person looking for my 1st new auto purchase, this was a great pick.  Since it's a sporty coupe however, it's slightly cumbersome w/ kids/elderly who may have problem w/ low design &amp; only 2 doors.   If you're looking for a great car w/ some serious power, don't overlook this steal.   <br><br>
