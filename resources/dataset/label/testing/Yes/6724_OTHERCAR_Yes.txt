            I recently acquired a well maintained 1990 Honda Accord LX. I must say that this is a fantastic little car. It is very reliable. The car has been in my family since it was new and it has not broken down or given us mechanical trouble once. This car was built to last. I have about 80,000 miles on it and it still runs strong. It is great to drive around town and on long trips. The stereo system has decent output and an included tape deck.

The engine is a 2.2L inline 4 cylinder which cranks out 125 horsepower. Not a lot, but the car has a surprising amount of pep for a family sedan. This car wasn't designed for acceleration, but there is plenty of torque available in the midband RPM region. 

Another thing I like is the configuration. The car sits very low, I have to be careful on bumpy roads lest I take out the oil pan or one of the bumpers. The low center of gravity lets you feel like you are in a sports car, and it improves handling. Secondly, the seats are very low inside. Your legs are placed almost straight out in front of you, adding to the sporty feel. Leg and headroom are plentiful. The automatic seatbelts are a pain in my a$$, but oh well. The trunk is roomy, but fills up quickly. The backseat isn't very roomy at all, particularly in the legroom area. 

Did I mention efficiency? This car gets about 2 weeks to a tank, give or take, and in the age of $2/gallon, thats fine by me. 

Now is it all great? Of course not. Even the mighty Honda has its limitations. One of teh A/C vents in the dashboard stopped working a while ago, its now stuck in the closed position. The interior passenger door handle housing cracked, and now the handle itself is loose. The springloaded cupholder can't be retracted, it stays out permanently now. Last fall, for about a week, the transmission was acting up, it would buck wildly during shifting, then it went away as mysteriously as it came. Around the same time, my throttle response disappeared, I lubed the throttle cable on the fuel injector and it was all better. And my biggest gripe is that the power door locks quit a while back. Then the power antennae went. Now the weatherstripping on the driver window lets a draft in at high speeds. These are all just typical signs of a now 11-year-old car showing its age. 

For all its fit and finish problems, I wouldn't give it away to anyone. Its sheer reliability and worry-free driving is worth the minor squeaks and rattles. I'm rapidly approaching 100,000 miles, so we'll see how many more days this car has. I hope it has many.


***UPDATE*** 6/12/01
I wrote a lot about the reliability of this car in this Epinion, saying it never broke down and gives me worry-free driving. Indeed, Honda is widely renowned for their reliability. However, all of that went out the window this past weekend as the car broke down on a busy 3-lane road this past weekend. My ignition system failed, and the car just mysteriously shut itself off at about 40 miles per hour, and I glided to a stop in the middle of an intersection. I've maintained the car well as far as oil changes, new hoses, belts, fluids, and filters, and this is what I get. The repairs were more than $500 as the parts had to be ordered. Needless to say I was annoyed. My trepidation grows each time I slide behind the wheel. What's next, a transmission job? In March, the upper radiator hose blew, because the thermostat failed. I was able to perform that repair myself. Now this. One more strike, and I go and buy the brand new Trans Am I want. Stay tuned...
