            Very impressed with the ride and handling of the updated Wrangler. Recently purchased the 2002 "X" model soft-top with the standard six-cylinder (190 HP) manual trans. More than enough power and room to comfortably propel 2 adults, 1 dog, and limited baggage for a weekend trek on or off the road.

We are pleased by the soft-top's relatively quiet highway ride. Surprisingly, after talking with other Wrangler owners who chose hard-tops, the new four-ply fabric top is actually more quiet at highway speeds. The fabric tends to absorb the noise, whereas the fiberglass hard-tops tend to bounce it all around. Optional front doors with glass windows also help to reduce the sound level even more.     
 
Although this jeep excels in go-anywhere 4x4 capability, its greatest limitation will become most apparent when volume shopping at Costco...Got Room?! Best to be considered a second vehicle.

My main concern is long-term dependability. Although I have not experienced any significant problems as of yet (6000 miles so far), it is a Chrysler product: The same people who produced the "K" car. Fit/finish is just OK. I noticed the door panels poorly cut/trimmed and occasionally pop-out on the edges. The interior plastic feels cheap and brittle and might possibly be prone to cracking do to its lack of flexibility. 

If some part should eventually need replacement, a big plus to this vehicle is the readily availability of aftermarket interior and exterior parts. One can rebuild an entire jeep just from ordering parts off the Web. 

Another negative is that the engine is an old-design and its operation feels loose and a bit sloppy (my '97 Isuzu Rodeo's engine with nearly 100K miles on it, in comparison, is tighter, silky-smooth, and easier to manipulate). I've been averaging 19-20 mpg on the highway. Auto reports say that the current engine might be upgraded with the same engine as the Jeep Liberty's possibly for the '03/'04 year model.
 

UPDATE: 6000+ MILES; The clutch would squeek when manipulated (fluid reservoir fixed under warranty). Also notice only a marginal difference between normal and bright headlight settings. Ironically, the "brights" dash indicator light is way too bright which tends to hinder the driver's oncoming view during dark driving conditions. The dash dimmer control has no affect on this light. The soft-top is very snug and tight-fitting (good), but it takes about 15 minutes of patience and dexterity to either put up or down (bad). Caution: The soft-top will chafe against body parts when lowered due to the nearly non-existent rear storage area (a very poor design). Lower the top with care.

OK, so even with all these gripes, I still highly recommend this sport vehicle (minus the word "utility") to anyone who wants/needs a little fun in their life. For us, the more miles we rack-up, the more we are pleased with the vehicle.
