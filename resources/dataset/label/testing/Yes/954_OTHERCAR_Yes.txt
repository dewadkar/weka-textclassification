            The corvette c5 is a good looking fast car but it also has good and bad.
the first thing i didnt like about the car was its seats.the seats gave me a feeling that i was gonna slide forward off the seat.it wasnt very comfortable.the other thing was rear view visiblity.but now to the good stuff.the power,345hp v8 with a nice smooth 6 speed trannsmission.this car produces nice acceleration to be able to cover the 1/4 mile in the 
13.2-13.4 range depending on launching ability.if you really look at the design of the car itself,its a great design.aerodynamics are really there,
handling is top notch and braking is a 9 out of 10.i truly really like the front end look of this car the most.it really sets the car apart from any other car on the streets.most people dont expect this car to really be this quick from the factory.but its a surpriser.with a sticker price of $45,000 its not the most expensive sports car in the world.its just a matter if you want a (import)supra or a (domestic)c5.either way you cant go wrong.<br><br>
