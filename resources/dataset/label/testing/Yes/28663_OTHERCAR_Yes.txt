            Kodak is keeping up with the digital technology. The DC200 plus camera has a very decent image resolution of up to 1152 x 864, still keeping it photo realistic. I wouldn't go for enlargements, but snapshots really turn out pretty nice. There's a 1.8&quot; TFT color LCD screen for review and preview, plus the optical viewfinder, which is pretty comparable to higher end digital cameras, and it has 4 flash modes that go up to 9.8', just like the DC240 for double the price. There's 4 exposure modes,and it comes with the 4MB Kodak picture card. You can pick this up now for less than what I paid for it, and it's still a good piece of equipment.<br><br>
