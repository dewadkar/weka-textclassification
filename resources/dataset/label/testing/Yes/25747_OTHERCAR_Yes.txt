            I work for a company driving all different kinds of cars.  I recently drove one of these VW Beetles.  I went in with a skeptical attitude, not at all expecting to like this car.  However, my opinion soon changed.  I can not tell you about it mechanically, or technically, but I can tell you how it drove.  

The New Beetle was easy to drive, and unexpectedly enjoyable.  It has some power behind its engine.  It accelerates great, it shifts easily, and it has speed and gumption!  I went in with the expectation of a rough ride, but was immediately surprised at the smooth ride.  

With most stick shifts I feel like it's work to drive, but with the New Beetle I did not feel that way at all.  It shifted easily and smoothly.  It was an easy transition between gears.  It's easy to get into reverse (which you can't say about every type of car).  If you want to pass someone, it has a lot of power behind that little engine, it speeds up easily and quickly.

The other thing I liked about it was the accessibility of the dashboard features.  Everything is so accessible, you don't have to stretch to reach knobs!  And it's actually comfortable to drive.

The one I drove was purple, and had a lot of character.  If you like this look it's the car for you!  If you don't like this look, I'd still suggest test driving it if it's in your price range, you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br><br>
