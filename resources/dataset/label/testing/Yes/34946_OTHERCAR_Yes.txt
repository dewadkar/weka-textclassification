            Of the GM car lines, Pontiac�s identity is �performance�.  The company�s slogan for the last few years has been �we build excitement�.  Is this a legitimate claim, or just marketing talk?   The Grand Prix is their bread and butter sports sedan/coupe.  I got a chance to drive the 4 door Grand Prix SE and the 2 door Grand Prix GT coupe on my latest business trip.  After driving the cars for 10 days in varying conditions, one thing has become clear to me.  The Grand Prix is a solid automobile.  It�s just hard to imagine anyone getting excited about driving one.  

The GP is available as SE, with a 3100 175hp engine, GT with a 3800 200 hp engine, and GTP, which puts a supercharged 240 hp 3.8L V6 under the hood.  All are equipped with Automatic 4 speed transmission.   My rental car had roughly 10000 miles.

Performance
Both cars pull off the line well, but the GT has a better top end.  Neither are slow, but they are also not blazingly fast.  Torque steer is evident at three quarters  lock and anything over half throttle.  

So far, my rental GM�s have had poor to marginal brakes.  The brakes on the GP-SE had better feel and stopping ability than any other GM car I�ve driven to date.  Then again, the Grand Prix GT had a sloppy feel and poor power, so I don�t know which was more typical.   Still, you would expect cars of the same model to offer similar feel on the brakes, so I think this is an indication of sloppy quality control from GM.  

When they started marketing this current model, the marketing line was �wider is better�.  The GP does handle pretty well for a GM car, and it makes esses without excessive body lean.  It hold line well, and has less understeer than other GM front drive sedans.  Trail braking into turns works well with this car.  

Styling
Outside, the car is understated in a good way.  None of the idiotic plastic trim that is so offensive on the Grand Am or the Bonnneville.   It could use a little more style on the back end.  The paste on decklid spoiler seems to serve no aerodynamic purpose, and adds nothing to the looks.  Or is this just a grab handle for the trunk?

The trunk is roomy, and flat, offering a large opening to load your bags in and out with ease.  as is the interior.  Time must sit still at Pontiac�s interior design department, because this car�s interior looks a lot like the Pontiac Grand Am I rented in 1990.  Hard plastic buttons
everywhere.  Grey plastic buttons on black plastic looks like a cheap kiddie toy.

How can anybody sit in this cockpit and feel excted about driving?  And the curvature of the seat is awful.  I found myself writhing about looking for better position.  After trying different seat angles for the first few days, it got a little better.  Fortunately, my daily drive took less than 25 minutes.  I think the thinly padded bucket seat is supposed to inspire a more sporty feel, and it is well bolstered on the sides to keep you in place through the curves.  Not that you would be inspired to push this car hard enough to need the extra support.  The bottom cushion is much better, and offers good thigh support.

Entry and exit from the car is effortless, and the large glass canopy of the GP offers the driver a good view all around.  It is, however, difficult to get a grasp of where the front corners of the car are.   

This being a rental car, it�s hard to tell what kind of quality has been built into the car.  The carpeting has come up on the passenger door side, and the trunk release button in the glove compartment looks like a dealer add-on.  And unless you know where to look, you will never find it.  I tried to find it while trying to load up in the rain, and had to use the key instead.  I guess most customers will get the remote security option, which will open the trunk remotely.  

The car came with a Delco CD 6 speaker stereo.  Although it looks like it should have a Fisher Price logo on it, the sound quality is surprisingly good, with clear highs and reasonable bass.   Nice stereo imaging, something not found in many cars. I felt it to be superior in sound quality to the Bose on my home car.    

Climate controls are simple, but positioned a little out of reach.  There are separate temperature zones for the driver and passenger.  I don�t know how well it works, but it is a nice feature that isn�t available in all cars.   

Conclusion

The Grand Prix lacks the high tech engine or the refined feel of imports.  At about two thirds the price, that�s probably acceptable to most.  Compared against domestic competition, (Intrepid, Taurus), it will more than hold its own.  Considering the price, I feel the Grand Prix is the best 4 door American sedan on the road today.  The only question mark will be its reliability, of which I am a little pessimistic of considering its GM lineage.
