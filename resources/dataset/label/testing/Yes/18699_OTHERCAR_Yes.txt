            I bought this camera a number of months ago and have taken a massive amount of pictures ever since.  Its picture quality is wonderfull, even professional quality.  In fact, I've taken advatage of its high resolution of several commercial jobs.  My only complaint is that it is quite small.  I've felt silly using it at times when I was trying to appear very mannered and artistic.  That aside, its controls are easy to navigate and the removable media is great.  The lens cap is a pain as there is no strap.  Also, the software is definitely sub par.  I use a shareware program for the downloading instead.<br><br>
