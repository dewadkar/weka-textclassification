            I bought my 1995 BMW 318IC used (from a private party) in 1997. When I made the purchase, the car had 8900 miles on it, so very low for a 2-year-old car. I drove the car for 10k miles/ 13 months, before I sold it. In the time that I had the car, I had only one problem, which was covered by the factory. The switch under the brake pedal that triggers the brake lights came off track. The repair took about an hour to fix, and I never encountered any other problem with the device. The car was fun to drive, although a little underpowered with the 1.8 liter 4 cylinder engine. On the 318 model, the convertible top is manual, unlike on the 325/328, which has a power top. That was a minor inconvenience, because it took all of about 15 seconds to put the top up or down. This car is extremely stable in handing corners, unlike a lot of the convertibles on the market today. I don't remember the exact numbers, but I do recall that it had very good gas mileage. Overall a GREAT CAR!<br><br>
