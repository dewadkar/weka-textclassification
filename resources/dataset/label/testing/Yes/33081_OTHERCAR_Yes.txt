Chevrolet is definitely hitting their stride with regard to building great trucks. Even the once lowly S10 is turning out to be a pretty good vehicle, and somewhat of a value to boot. The Silverado is a top choice, the Tahoe is stellar, and even families that can afford much more are choosing the Suburban as their family hauler. In addition, the new TrailBlazer and its ultra-smooth inline 6 is a near perfect mid-size SUV (recent recalls notwithstanding). 

Built on the same platform as GMs other full size trucks, the Avalanche is an attempt at offering all the Chevy truck-like qualities we want, with the added versatility of an SUV. In case you haven&#146t noticed, versatility is the name of the game these days. On the one hand, the Avalanche is nothing more than a Chevy pickup with a bunch of plastic cladding thrown on to make it look more rugged. On the other hand, we are faced with the fact that the Avalanche has no real equal in the new truck market. Frankly, the Subaru Baja is more like the Avalanche than anything Ford or Dodge have to offer, but comparing the car based Baja to the Avalanche is just plain silly. Still, it&#146s worth mentioning that Avalanche has no real equal. 

Whether or not the Avalanche is truly more versatile than other SUVs is all a matter of perspective and need. If you need the option of carrying more than 5 people or a bunch of cargo, better stick with the Suburban. If however, if you need to haul real truck stuff like engine blocks, gravel, sand, bricks or compost, plus the option of a huge enclosed bed, and seating for up to 5, and you may need to switch between the two in the middle of nowhere, the Avalanche is all you baby. Converting the cab is easy, the only tricky part is storing the window in the tabs &#150 it works but takes a little practice to do it as quickly as the TV commercials suggest. There is also the possibility that you need a truck and just want to look a lot cooler than everybody else &#150 again, the Avalanche is for you.

General Motors has gone to great lengths to let the public and journalists alike know that the 2003 Avalanche is now available without the plastic body side molding, or what commonly referred to as cladding. While we applaud this effort to give the public what they want, we can&#146t help but wonder why our test vehicle arrived with the cladding ON. Either way, the point is worth mentioning; you can order the Avalanche minus the plastic body molding. Some hate that plastic stuff; others think it adds to the rugged nature and look &#150 now both camps can be happy. In all fairness, those who plan to venture off-road will probably benefit from the body hardware as it can withstand rocks, sand and other debris the tires might kick up.

Off-roaders may want to consider the Z71 package. It includes on/off-road tires, deep rubber floor mats, 17-inch wheels, specially tuned shocks and springs, high capacity air-cleaner, locking rear diff., and skid plates. The Z71 package adds $592 to the price.

Why are Chevrolet trucks so much better than the others? Two reasons smooth, powerful drive train, and very comfortable ride quality. The Avalanche 1500 has both. We don&#146t expect the 2500 to be any different, but the 1500 is the one we drove. Like other GM trucks, the Avalanche boasts predictable handling, and almost car like ride around town and on the open highway (even with the Z71 suspension). Other trucks pale by comparison. Road noise is minimal although there is moderate tire noise at approximately 50-63 MPH (when equipped with the Z71 off-road package). Drive faster and it goes away, drive slower and it goes away. A 2-hour trip to the desert revealed the overall pleasant nature of the Avalanche &#150 there is little to complain about here.

The 285-hp Vortec V8 accelerates nicely, but don&#146t expect to win and drag races. There is plenty of power, but this is a big, heavy truck. The Vortec engines are powerful, but they are smooth as well. Engine noise is minimal, even under heavy acceleration. There is noticeable exhaust noise, but the sound is pleasant and adequately muffled &#150 besides, a V8 should be heard. 

Inside, seats are wide and comfortable front and back. The rear seating area does suffer slightly with regard to legroom, but most adults will find no reason for complaint. Our test vehicle came with the Personal Security package as well as the Driver Convenience package that includes such features as adjustable pedals, Homelink, OnStar, and power folding outside mirrors. Given all this luxury, and the $41, 331 final price tag, why do the seat backs adjust manually? At least the driver&#146s seat should be fully power. In addition, the lever to adjust the seat back is in an awkward location.

The roomy cab has enough storage areas and bins to make anyone happy. A huge center console storage bin will hold almost anything, and the cup holders are equally versatile. Overhead lights are also especially handy. This truck comes off like more of a tool than just and automobile. Extra power outlets and slotted bins below the stereo will make pack rats very happy.

Admittedly the Avalanche is for people who have pretty specific needs in the way they use their SUV. And at the same time, this truck is easy enough for anyone to use everyday. Comfortable, easy to convert and cool looking, the Avalanche seems to have it all. Although the Avalanche lives up to its rugged and versatile image, it&#146s not a vehicle that could be considered an alternative to the wonderful Tahoe or Suburban. Those in the market for an F-150, Silverado or Sierra crew cab owe it to themselves to drive the Avalanche. It could change your mind about what a truck can do.
