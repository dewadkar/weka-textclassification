            I really didn't want to get rid of my '91 Mercury Cougar, but it had nearly 200,000 miles on it and aesthetically, it left a lot to be desired. But it was such a fantastic and beautiful car. I needed to find something that was 1) equally as beautiful; 2) had a great CD player; and 3) was comfortable to drive.  I found all that and so much more in the 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS.  First, it's just a beautiful car. I get SO MANY compliments on it. Every time I pull up at a convenience store, a complete stranger comments on how good looking it is. The seats are extremely comfortable and the ability to heat them in the winter is great when the wind chill is around zero. The sunroof is wonderful in the summer and I can actually hear the radio/CD player just fine with the sunroof open ... unlike many cars I've been in. The car is also very very fast and responsive. If I need to pick up speed in a hurry (usually to get around some annoyingly slow driver), she doesn't hesitate to give me all the power I need. The traction control feature is a blessing when it snows, but especially effective when it rains hard and fast and the potential for hyrdroplaning is greatly increased on our flat Oklahoma highways. I get nearly 30 miles to the gallon, but I realize that may be slightly lower for people who mostly do city driving. At least half of my driving is on highways. The trunk is very large. I've hauled multiple golf bags, groceries, Christmas trees, and many other things in it with no problems. The one and only problem I've had with the car since buying it new in March 2000 was to replace the driver's side window control mechanism. My husband was able to install it easily and the part was $40. I should also mention that getting in the back seat is not the easiest thing in the world. That's not a huge issue for me because I don't have kids and don't often have many people riding with me.
