              I purchased a 1999 Dodge Ram 2500 Quad Cab Cummins Diesel 4x4 for 1 reason and 1 reason only.....to pull a load.  I use it to pull a 30 foot travel trailer.  As far as I am concerned I could not of made a better choice in a tow vehicle.
  This truck replaces my former 96 Dodge 1500 Ram with a 360 cid.  The difference is night and day!  The Cummins Diesel is a workaholic, the more load you put on it the more it likes it.  I figure that the $4000 investment in a diesel engine will pay for its self over the long haul.  I went from getting 5 to 6 MPG pulling a 8 thousand pound trailer to over 13 MPG with the diesel.  I also get funny looks from others as I pull out to pass them on the Interstate while going up hill!
   My truck has an automatic transmission.  It gets the job done but you have to know how to drive it.  Don't be afraid to lock out the overdrive and manually select gears.  If I would have it to do over again I would however get the 6 speed manual transmission.  This tranny is better for full time pulling, a manual transmission also makes it easier to add an exhaust brake.  This is something that no manufacture offers as a factory option. This is one safety item all mfgs that offer a diesel pick-up should offer.  this will save wear and tear on the trucks braking system also provide more stopping power.
  Overall I would have to rate the Dodge Ram Excellent.  We all know that in side the cab there is plenty of room.  The ride is excellent.  It gets better fuel mileage than the Ford Power Stroke.  The reason why I say this is, a friend of mine pulls a 26 foot travel trailer that weighs apx 6000 pounds.  The best fuel mileage he can get while pulling his camper with his 1999 F-250 Super Duty diesel is 8 to 9 MPG.  Both his truck and my truck are pretty much identical in options.  Except he does not have the best option of all.....that Cummins ISB cradled in a Ram!
