            We really needed a car, We were driving a car that can only be described as a trash can on wheels....So even though any car would have been a huge step up for us, We still chose to research our purchase very throughly.
I read 8 books on buying cars new and/or used and even went through Consumer Reports. I admit the 1998 white Sunfire GT I eventually purchased was not the tops in all these lists and books, But it consistently rated as a *good well rounded car*
After test driving 6 different Sunfires ranging from the basic 4 door model to the fully loaded power everything model I purchased I can see why Sunfires are one of the top selling cars in North America.
They are definetly not a luxury car, But these cars offer style, a sporty look, and a little zest under the hood for a fraction of the cost of other makes. And the gas consumption is great!

The buttons for the windows, lights, mirrors and radio/CD player are all easy to locate and control.

The seats are comfortable for short trips and in town comuting, But it does get a bit uncomfortable on a longer trip. I use a seat pad which helps alot. The backseat has limited leg room, But it fine for kids and shorter people.

All in all a nice well rounded car, great features and looks as well as gas mileage for a fair price.
