            I have driven Honda Accords for 12 years now and when I get a new car, it will be another Honda Accord.  The Honda people have just one problem with me: they build their cars so well that I don't need a new one very often.

My current 1994 Honda has 147,000 miles on it and it is running strong.  On a recent trip to Austin, Texas, my car averaged over 32 miles per gallon over the 700 mile round trip.  I live 350 miles from Austin and if I fill the tank before I leave, I still have almost a quarter of a tank left when I arrive in Austin.

I have always been impressed with the handling of Hondas.  I have avoided several accidents because the car is so manuverable.  I can turn completely around on much smaller streets than almost any car I've driven.  All this in a vehicle which does not seem small to me.  I am 6'3" and I weigh over 220 pounds and I have no trouble fitting into the car.  I would have trouble sitting in the back because the legroom there is much smaller.

With both of my cars I have had very few mechanical problems.  The transmissions are practically perfect and I have not had one brake job after 147,000 miles.  I have taken good care of this car because it has taken good care of me.

My only complaint is actually my wife's complaint:  she says the seats are uncomfortable.  I don't think so but I have a lot more padding in back.

I have a AM-FM-cassette with excellent speakers (all standard) and I play both full time with no problems.

Another complaint I've heard is that this is not an American car.  Over 70% of the Honda Accord is put together in the U.S.A. and besides why not buy the best wherever its made?  I believe U.S. cars have improved greatly primarily because of Honda and Toyota.

Anyway, this is a fine car for a reasonable price.  What more can I ask. P.S.: The car is too noisy on the road.
