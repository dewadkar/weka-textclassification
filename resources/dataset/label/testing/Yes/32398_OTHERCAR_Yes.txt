            When my 1988 Toyota Corolla bit the dust, I had a far-from-pleasant experience being stranded on the side of a busy California highway.  That's when I decided a new Honda Civic was what I needed.  I knew this because my sister purchased a new Honda Civic over 5 years ago, and has not had ANY problems with it.  She of course has taken it to the shop several times for maintenance, but her car has never broken down.  The same goes for my Honda Civic which I have had for for 14 months now.  I believe that if I keep taking good care of my car, that I could own it (trouble free) for the next 10 years.  

The only negative side to this car is that it is rather small.  Sometimes I have a larger load than this car will allow.  (And I have the coupe model- I don't know what I would do if I had the hatchback.)  Also, if I was in a horrible car accident, I'm not sure that this car would protect me as well as a larger car.  However, I have to consider that I did not pay much for this car.  The reliability, looks, and gas efficiency are well worth the cost of the car.
