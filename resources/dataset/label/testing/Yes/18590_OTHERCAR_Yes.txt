            The Alero is nearly identical under the skin to the Pontiac Grand Am, and the pair also share many parts with the Chevy Malibu (and its discontinued twin, the Olds Cutlass).  Here's how GM works these days: if you want the largest, most practical car for your money, and don't care much about how the thing looks, buy a Chevy.  If you want to draw attention to yourself with wild styling in and out, buy a Pontiac.  If you want a nice looking (but not overly flashy), very good all-around car, buy an Olds.  I personally tend to fall in the last category.  The last car I bought, for my wife, was an Intrigue (see separate review).  Before buying the Intrigue, I also took a look at the Alero.  This review is based on that test drive.

Like all of the new Oldsmobiles, the Alero is tastefully styled inside and out.  The taillamps are the most unusual exterior feature.  They are very large, and strangely shaped.  GM's goal here was probably to make them look as different from those of the Grand Am as possible.  They succeeded.  Every time I come up behind an Alero, however, they always strike me as being disproportionately large.  The rest of the exterior is very nicely done.  The interior is very similar to that of the Intrigue, which was patterned after the Lexus.  Especially in leather it looks very nice.  While Pontiac uses red lighting inside, Olds uses blue, which is easier on the eyes at night.

Though hardly a small car by international standards, with a 107 inch wheelbase and 187 inch length, the Alero is Oldsmobile's smallest car.  Relative to the exterior, the interior is compact, especially in width.  In front, there is just enough room to be comfortable.  In a positive vein, the narrower cockpit makes the Alero feel more sporting than an Intrigue.  

The back seat is where the Alero falls down a little.  To get decent (though still marginal) headroom beneath the stylish roofline, GM has positioned the seat very low to the floor.  As a result, adult back seat passengers have little thigh support.  Longer legs will flop to the sides.  I personally find this uncomfortable.  The high beltline (base of the windows) in the rear is another problem.  This not only limits visibility from the drivers seat, but makes it harder for rear seat occupants to see out.  The rear seat in the Intrigue is positioned much higher, and the beltline in the rear is lower, which is one reason I spent the extra money for that car.  (I was also buying when the Alero first came out, and I prefer to buy depreciated, one-year-old cars.) If you would like a much more serviceable rear seat and better visibility for less money, then GM offers the Malibu for you.  The downside to the Malibu is its appliance-like styling.  For much of the market, this is not an issue.

The 3.4 liter V-6 accelerates well.  While it doesn�t make the most sophisticated noises, its sound is not unpleasant�unlike the four.  The automatic transmission is very smooth, and tends to downshift readily.  Overall the powertrain will satisfy nearly all people.

The steering is very responsive.  Though firm, it is a little lacking in feel.  The car responds quickly to steering inputs.  The car leans very little in turns, and never wallows.  The trade-off is that the ride is a little too firm for my tastes.  It gets too jiggly on some surfaces.  Most of the time though, the Alero rides comfortably.  The brake pedal is refreshingly firm (a rarity in American cars), and the brakes respond quickly.

I guess this is what the Alero ads mean by the �Active Response System.�  I hate ad hype like that.  The suspension of this car is a very common design, with struts in the front and trailing and lateral links in the rear.  Sure it has rack-and-pinion steering, but so does just about every other car.  I�m tired copywriters taking advantage of the ignorance of the car-buying public by touting the sophistication of MacPherson struts and rack-and-pinion steering.  It just takes this to a new level to call a group of such common parts an �Active Response System.�  Does that really mean anything to anybody?  I guess ad copywriters have simply run out of meaningful things to say, even about a fairly good car like the Alero.
