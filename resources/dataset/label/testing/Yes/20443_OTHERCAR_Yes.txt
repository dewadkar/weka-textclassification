            Don't get me wrong - I love my Jetta, but she drives me crazy with all the little things that go wrong with her.

One of the first times I took her in for maintenance I asked the guys about the yellow-ish ooze that was coming out of the doors onto the exterior of the car. They say it's normal for dark colored cars on hot days, but that doesn't sit well with me - my new car should not have been oozing goo! They said it would go away (once it had all oozed out) but it's still there!!

Then the rubber-like finish on the latch of the center console started peeling, but that went away when the latch broke (!!) and they replaced the whole lid of the console.

The cup holders are lame - especially the rear cup holders. Don't even think of putting a Starbuck's cup with the cardboard insulator in any of the cup holders - it'll pop the arm right out of it's socket. Any water bottles except for the smallest size do this too.

Whenever I have the car serviced (every 3,000 miles) it's almost out of oil (which, I know...I need to remember to top off regularly - especially now that I know that lots of people have this problem).

One day I was driving I tried to roll up the window, but when I pushed the button, it didn't do anything. Two seconds later the whole window just fell straight into the door! They fixed it and said that it might happen to the passenger side too!!

When I took my Jetta into the dealership to have something related to the emission something or other fixed (it had been recalled) and they told me that I needed to have the gas cap replaced because I had an after market gas cap. Not true! That's the same ol' gas cap that's been on the car since I first drove it home - unless there's a gas cap fairy on the loose!

Then today my pretty little Jetta decided that she didn't want to come out of Park. Period. She was towed to the dealership where she is (hopefully) getting fixed.

VW's used to be well-built cars from what I hear. If I didn't love that car so much, I'd be really angry...instead, I'm just disappointed in VW. The dealership likes to tell me that whatever problem I'm having "happens all the time" but that just really does not make me feel better about buying another VW down the line. If my car was a freak, then so be it, but they seem resigned to the fact that Jettas will have all these problems, and that's okay with them.
