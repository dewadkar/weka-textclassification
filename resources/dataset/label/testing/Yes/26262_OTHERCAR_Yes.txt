            I spent three months checking out new vehicles in the $15,000.00 - $18,000.00 range and I decided on the Honda Civic EX.  The car is great on gas mileage... I average 320- 340 miles per tankful(10 gal). I put about 2,500 miles on a month.  It has all the extras standard... cruise control, sunroof, cd player.  I used to own a civic hatchback ... in four years I put 100,000 miles on it and never did any maintenance besides changing the oil.

The car handles well and has pretty good pick up... I find the 5 speed has better pick than the standard.  I will say the colors this year are kind of limited... but I firmly believe the is not a better car in this class for the money.

I found the hatchback to be great when I need to haul things around... but the coupe has a better &quot;look&quot; to it.

Also it is well worth it to shop on line first to get the best deal.<br><br>
