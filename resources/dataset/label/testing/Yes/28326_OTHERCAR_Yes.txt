            lIKE i SAID--wow. What a kick in the pants. Power is everywhere.Pound for pound this car is great for the price considering autos like porche,ferrari,mercedes,The new corvette is a dream to drive and is a very forgiving car to handle. The bose sound system is also a blast. No matter what gear I was in I had power to spare. Just remember this all comes with a price. Upkeep on a car like this is not cheap. You do have to remember that part of being able to afford a car is not only the price but also things like tires,insurance,tuneups. I believe that it is also important to realize that the corvette should be a second car,and not an everyday one unless you drive alot of highway. Gas milage is better than what you might think,until you start to drive it like it was ment to be. And let's face it,you don't buy it to go to the grocery store or to church on sunday
unless you want to show it off. Chevrolet keeps outdoing themselves in styling. The new corvette has all the looks to someone who never owned one
before and to someone who remembers the history and previous styles of the ones before. This car is worth a test drive even if you decide a camaro is more in your price range.No matter what else is parked in the lot or out on the road,the corvette will always get attention. <br><br>
