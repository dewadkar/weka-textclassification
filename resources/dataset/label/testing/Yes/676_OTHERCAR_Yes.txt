            Nikon's Coolpix 950 is a technological wonder with a feature list a mile long. But unlike most consumer-level digital cameras, the Coolpix 950 makes it nearly impossible to take advantage of these features without a good long look at the manual. The camera's stunning array of buttons and
dials will likely confuse most novice users--and maybe a few experts. But if you can crack the codes, you'll get photographic power unheard of in a camera priced under $1,000, not to mention some pretty good photos. I must say that after i figured out how to use it I have been pleased with the results. I would recommend this to anyone seriously interested in photography, not for a beginner.<br><br>
