               You see too many yuppie-wagons these days. Lexus, Mercedes, Lincoln, and now even BMW has jumped on the SUV bandwagon. But there are still a few of us who actually care about offroad ability when buying an SUV. 
   My opinion? The Isuzu Trooper. I have owned my Trooper for about eight months now, and it's flawless offroad manners have helped me time and again. A frequent skier, I have hauled the truck up snowy mountain roads many a time without so much as a slip. Just flip it into winter driving mode and activate the Torque On Demand four wheel drive system, and prepare for an effortless drive. 
   Before buying the Trooper, I tested many vehicles. The GMC Yukon, for instance, is a good offroader, and a great heavy hauler, but the Sherman Tank handling was not really to my liking. The Dodge Durango could also be a good alternative to the Isuzu. It's third seat also gives it the upper hand... IF you want to get 13 miles to the gallon... or less. My friend recently purchased a Durango SLT plus, with the 5.9liter Magnum V8... but traded it for (whatdya know...) A trooper when he got an unsatisfactory, almost ghastly 10 miles to the Gallon. I'll be frank here... the trooper won't get &quot;Geo Metro Mileage&quot;... I get about 15-18 miles to the gallon depending on drive conditions, but it is, in my mind, a small (and unavoidable) price to pay for a true off roading vehicle. On that note, I have noticed that 4WD has not affected mileage. 
   The Isuzu Trooper is available with only one engine... A 210-hp, 3.5L V6. This may seem small for such a large vehicle, but it has performed well for me on every drive. This is mated to a smooth shifting 4 speed automatic, powering the rear wheels when not in four wheel drive. 
   In the Luxury trim level, complete with leather interior, multimeter (temperature, compass, altitude, barometric pressure, etc.), premium audio system with 6-disc CD changer, 16&quot; Aluminum Alloy Wheels, Two tone paint, and a 5 square foot sunroof (huge), the Trooper topped out at about $35,000. But in base trim level, with the standard Torque on Demand 4WD system and now an automatic transmission, the Trooper will only cost you about $25-27,000. This is small, compared with The Yukon or Durango, both base models starting at over 30 grand. Isuzu has often gotten less than prefect wraps for their cars, but I am one of many satisfied owners, that refuses to join the Yuppie SUV craze.
