            Our dilemma in choosing a digital camera was in whether to choose a digital video camera that could capture stills or a digital camera which could also, on occasion, shoot video.  We found the perfect solution in the Sony Mavica.  This camera takes brilliant resolution photos and will even capture up to 60 seconds of video (and honestly, how much video can you stand to watch and re-watch, anyway?).  The camera works best outdoors or in well lighted indoor areas.  For convenience, you can take pictures using an LCD screen on the back of the camera, or through a viewfinder like a traditional camera.  Since purchasing the camera in about July of 1999, we have taken well over 3000 photographs - action and stills.  The autofocus works very well in capturing split second shots and the zoom is phenomenal.  While we have been averaging between 30-40 photographs per floppy disk, we are now backing all of our photographs up on a cd-r and then re-using the disks.  This camera has been perfect for us, as new parents, since we can take pictures almost daily and e-mail them away to grandparents and other relatives.  The print quality of captured images is also excellent.  We would definitely recommend this camera to photohounds, like us, who take lots of pictures and can't wait an hour to see the finished product.<br><br>
