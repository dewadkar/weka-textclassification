                We presently own a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo which we purchased in August of 2000. We were on the hunt for an SUV because of our growing family. As far as price is concerned we found that the Rodeo was about middle of the road. We knew we weren't in the price range of a Toyota 4-Runner but still wanted something who's size and interior room was comparable.
    Although I am in love with the new shape and body-style, I feel the interior of the Rodeo needs a major make-over. I find that it is quite primitive compared to it's competition. (4-Runner,Montero,Explorer,ect.) It just isn't as luxury as it should be for a vehicle that was made in 1999.
    One thing that I absolutely HATE is the open headrests. I'm not sure if that is an option that you can upgrade to or not but in any event the ones in our vehicle are extremely uncomfortable. Especially if you are stuck in bumper to bumper traffic on the highway and would just like to lay your head back for a moment. 
    I feel that this vehicle is for someone like ourselves who just can't indulge in the $35,000.00 SUV's but is looking for something to haul the wonderful &quot;stuff&quot; that comes with having children. (ie: bicycles, stroller, skateboards, diaper bag,ect.)     <br><br>
