            Before I purchased this camera I did my fair share of research. I found the price to be the only factor from me just going out and finding the first place to buy it. I was lucky enough to find it included in a whole package deal from an online reseller. 

I was not disappointed when I started using the camera. The image quality is simply outstanding, and the ease of use is just great. There are also many different features for the more advanced users, but beginner photographers can use the camera without confusion.

With the camera you receive a 32MB Compact Flash card as the storage device. I would highly recommend upgrading to a 128MB CF card if you intend on using this camera often. They cost around $100 at your local dealer and the card will provide you the ability of taking over 100 pictures at the highest setting.

The swivel on the camera&#146s LCD screen is also superior to other companies&#146 versions. With the swivel LCD you are able to protect the delicate screen by flipping it over and storing it away. Other cameras don&#146t have a moveable screen, which leaves it unprotected, and venerable to breakage. The swivel LCD screen also allows the user endless possibilities to take picture at different angles. With the addition of the remote, you can take perfect group pictures.

One of the things I did not like about the camera is the overall size and weight. This may not be a factor to the more professional photographers but for beginners this is not a take anywhere type of camera. For someone who wants a digital camera to take to social gatherings for point and click type use, I would recommend getting another type of camera. 

Another weak point in the camera is in the handle itself. The contours of the grip are great but can become slippery with it being solely plastic. The G3 has fixed this problem with the introduction of a rubber non-slip grip. I myself have not dropped the camera but the possibility still lingers.

For best results I would also advise the user to invest in a tripod. For perfect picture the camera has to remain still for a few second after the shutter has opened. If there is a little movement from when the button was pressed to image capture blurring will occur.
