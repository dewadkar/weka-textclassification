            It's July, 1998. I am heading home with my daughter in our 850 wagon ( The identical twin/predecessor to the V70).  She's in a booster in the middle back seat, wearing a lap/shoulder belt. I approach an intersection on a green light. On the other side of the light, an unlicensed, uninsured driver waits to turn left.  He sees me coming, but thinks he can make the turn before I get there.  Unfortunately, he's wrong. I spot him as he makes the turn and jam on the brakes.  The antilocks work great, slowing me down from 35 to around 30, but there isn't enough time to stop and the two cars collide at nearly head-on.

I remember seeing the oncoming car and hitting the brakes. At the point of impact, the seat belt tensioners jerked my seat belt tight, pulling me in the ideal position for the airbag to deploy. I don't remember seeing the airbag go off, but I remember my vision getting dark for a split second, then seeing the airbag laying in my lap. My car had stopped moving at that point and the air was filled with dust from the air bag.  I checked my daughter and found she was unharmed.  I, too, was unharmed, aside from &quot;rug burns&quot; on the inside of my arms from the airbag.  We virtually walked away from a significant car wreck.

The volvo incurred about $16K in damages, and was declared a total loss.  Remarkably, the passenger compartment was completely intact and had not been compromised.  The front end crumple zones had done their job.

To give you some perspective on the matter, I'm a police officer.  I've seen more than my share of wrecks, and I was quite stunned that we walked away, virtually unhurt, from this one. 

After the wreck, there was no question as to what we were going to buy to replace the 850. So my wife and I headed straight to the Volvo dealership and bought a new V70.  The interior is much nicer than the 850.  The bumps have been smoothed out, and the amenities much nicer.  We average around 20-22mph.  We did have some problems with an oxygen sensor that made our &quot;check engine&quot; light come on every week or so, necessitating a trip to the dealer, who couldn't quite figure the cause, but other than that, we are quite happy with our choice.  

The only thing we could complain about is the paint on the bumpers, which seems to scratch off quite easily.  My daughter complains that we no longer have the 3rd rear seat, which is a $1,000.00 option. Our V70 has 25,000 miles on it now, and aside from the oxygen sensor, has never given us a problem.

((Update: November 2000)) It's been two years and some change since we got the car.  It now has 33,000 miles on it, and frankly, I'm worried that I didn't buy the extended warranty.  Here's why: We seem to be running into a lot of electrical problems.  First the O2 sensor went out and a whole host of parts that monitor emissions and cause the &quot;check engine&quot; light to go on. We've been through several light bulbs and several turn signal bulbs, and recently the electronics on our heat and air system went out. What really impressed me is when I went to the dealer last week and the service manager pulled my file.  I mentioned how big it was for a newer car, and he said, &quot;yours is nothing&quot;. <br><br>
