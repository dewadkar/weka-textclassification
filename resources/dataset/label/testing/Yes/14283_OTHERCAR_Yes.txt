            I just traded my 1998 GMC Suburban SLT 1500 in on the new 2000 Chevy LT 1500.  Right away I noticed a major improvement in the handling characteristics.  It handles very much like a car and has a great ride. The 98 GMC was nice but the new premium ride package with Auto ride, a $700.00 option, is a big improvement in my mind.  Of course the new LT comes with Onstar which is fine for emergencies but not much else as far as my lifestyle is concerned.  The LT also has a electric sunroof, new for 2000, but it also omits the automatic climate control when you get it.  Every where I looked the dealers had opted for the sunroof without concern for the climate control option.  
     One of the greatest things I like about my new suburban are the bucket seats in the second row.  These allow for quick exit and entry in to the third row which is a big improvement over last year.  Also I really like the fact they put the spare under the truck as it always used to squeak when riding on rough roads and was annoying at the least.
They have also taken the cup-holders from in front of the vents( which was always a bad idea in my book) and  put them in the console where there once was one (so... 1 less cup-holder for this year)  
     Of course Auto-trac 4 wheel drive, power-heated seats, compass and temp, along with a great stereo featuring cd/cassette and rear audio controls( for my kids )are all standard on the new LT. The doors do appear to close more solidly with less hollow sound and are more car-like in appearance than before.  
      Now for the other part.  I do feel as though the new Suburban is slightly smaller than its predecessor and it appears to have less power in the 5.3 liter engine, even though the manufacturer claims it has more horsepower than the previous model and it is smaller than the 5.8 liter; which was standard fare on the 98 models. Incidently the 5.3 V-8 is the only engine currently available on the 2000 model 1500.  
     Chevy rates my model for towing up to 7800 lbs. which is more than a big boat or an average 24 foot travel trailer. I can say that I'm averaging about 14-15 mpg per tank which is slightly better than before. 
     These comparisons are much easier for me to draw since we also own a 2000 Chevy Z-71 Tahoe which happens to be the older body style despite its being a 2000 model. I'm still getting used to the new Chevy but I already know enough to say that I recommend this suburban for anyone who wants style, ride and functionality in a large towing suv.  Lastly, I also drove the Excursion and opted for the Suburban( for more money) due to the engine noise of the Ford,  better interior styling and comfort, along with more interior amenities than the Ford such as bucket seats , sunroof, light sentry, etc. I hope this helps someone make the decision that's right for them.<br><br>
