            I bought the 1991 Accord wagon used with 62k miles on it. I was 17 then and not all that keen on buying a station wagon. I was somewhat in a hurry to get a car and I had my mind made up on Honda Accord. My parents and I went to the Honda dealer and there it was, the only Accord on the used side. What sold me on the car was the immaculate condition to which it had been maintained and at only 62k miles, this Honda was still in kindergarten! So for $10k cash I drove away in my Accord. I must say that I have really put the car through some stress and it has served me very loyally. I joke and say that all you have to do is seal the vents and its will drive underwater. It still rides very smooth and quiet after almost 10 years and 118k miles. I have had nearly zero problems with it. The only situation was when the topmost radiator hose busted. With 15$ and the kindness of a stranger who brought me to AutoZone it was fixed. It is imperitive, with a Honda, that you follow the scheduled maintenance religiously. I have done so and it can get kind of expensive. My biggest gripe about the car are several "usual" problems with this model. The front door handles will crack to bits. My driver handle is split in 3 places and it still works! I have no clue as to whats holding it up, but until I have to roll the window down to open my door- I'm leaving it alone. The passenger door handle is starting to crack also. At 80k miles my CV joints went out. I paid $768 at the dealer to have them changed using genuine Honda parts. These drive shafts are $192 apiece. About 2 months ago I noticed the right side knocking again. What really gets me is that I just had these changed 34k miles ago!!! Honda parts are only warranted for 12 months or 12k miles. I truly did not expect them to give out this quick. About 2 weeks ago I brought it in for a 30k mile maintenance. They confirmed that the CV joint did need to be changed. I also need a new oil pan gasket (though I have NEVER seen oil on my cement), and also one of my engine mounts is bad. It is evident as the steering wheel and the hood vibrate considerably at idle or in reverse. I have also been through 2 power antennas, one battery, a 90k mile maintenance, and a whole lot of gas and oil changes. The car still looks and runs great. I had to remove the factory radio. I replaced the speakers with JBL, added a Blaupunkt receiver and a 240-watt amp. I have also had the windows tinted. This is a very good car and my next car will surely be another Honda, I highly recommend them if you DO NOT want to be left on the side of the road. Only thing, the dealer will get you for maintenance.
