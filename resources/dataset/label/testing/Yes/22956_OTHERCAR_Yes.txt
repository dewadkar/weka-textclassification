            I'm used to having big cars.  My first car was a huge Cadillac Seville back in '83.  This thing is so tiny, and so zippy, I feel like I can do anything!  Very solid car and I feel safe at all times.
I hit a patch of ice during a bad snow storm here in Boston in October.  I slid into a wood light pole at approx. 8-10 MPH.  Took it in to get fixed and the bill was $3000+.  Very expensive to repair, but I should have just put snow tires on the front, improper planning on my part.  Very light wight car which is great for the mileage, but bad for New England winters.  
The upgraded Monsoon stereo is amazing for the little money it costs and the other upgrades (moon roof, heated mirrors, etc...) are relatively cheap as well.
The back seats fold down very easily, and there is plenty of room for anything you might need to fit.  With the seats up, the back still fits a months worth of groceries.
All in all the new Golf is a very fun car to drive and great on mileage.
