            Before rushing out to purchase a 1994 Hyundai Excel one must understand the following:

BE CAREFUL:

The Excel is nothing more than a throw away car. It is cheaply made and at times can be very dangerous to drive. The 1994 Excel comes with no safety features. This is a base model, low end vehicle that was made for around town shopping or as cheap transportation to and from work.

The 4 cylinder engine is under powered and unless you purchase it with the 5 speed transmission, it will take you along time to get up to highway speeds.
The vehicle has one of the worst braking systems I have ever driven. When it�s raining, allow plenty of room between yourself and the car in front of you, as the excel sometimes will start to skid under certain conditions.
 After awhile you will also notice that the engine burns oil. Mine uses about a quart every 1,000 miles or so. With an automatic transmission the vehicle is under powered and as far as I�m concerned useless. The automatic transmission also has some serious problems and many owners have had to replace them.
  In my opinion this car can be a death trap if used by an inexperienced driver.
 Standard equipment on the Excel is non existent. Every thing is an option. Remember now, this vehicle cost $5,995 new.

OK: Let me think of something positive about the Excel.
Hmmm, well the trunk can hold 3 suitcases, and with the 5 speed it moves along well in the snow.

The Hyundai Excel should not be used by a student driver. There are too many flaws about this vehicle that can be life threatening to an inexperienced driver. Instead this vehicle should be used as a second car by an adult and driven carefully.
If given a choice, move on and buy something else...
