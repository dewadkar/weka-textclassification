            Okay, my car isn't a 99, It's a 96.  The reason I am posting, though, is that I feel my opinion is valuable since I have been driving this car for a long time. I can be a good judge on how reliable it is.

Our family is not the type to trade a car off every two years.  we drive a car until the wheels fall off or the motor blows up.  In the ten years we have been married, my husband and I have only bought one new car--a 1996 Chevy Geo Metro.  It is a white four door. It has a low sloped front end and a high-seated rear end, making the car resemble an egg, hence the nickname &quot;Egg-mobile.&quot;  The car has changed very little since 1996, except Chevrolet has dropped the &quot;Geo&quot; line.  

This car has been very dependable.  We rely on this little car everyday as the family car and work car.  For years my husband drove it about+ 50 miles one way to work.  We have taken it on many long trips.  It has never (knock on wood) given us any problems.  We have never had the car in the shop for anything besides routine maintanince (oil changes, tires, breaks, ect.).  It starts everytime we turn the key, and it gets us where we want to go, no muss, no fuss, thank you very much.

The car is a Geo, and it has a little engine.  This is great for gas millage, and bad for power.  My 1988 Toyota Tercel has alot more power, and it has engine problems.  But, turn off the air conditioner, put the pedal to the floor, and the car will pass in good time.

The other complaint I have about this car is that it has a small back window and a high trunk, which makes it difficult to judge distance while passing or driving in reverse.  It also only seats four.  This is good when you are a family of four, but bad when you want to take Nana along for the ride.

This car will be paid off later this year.  We plan on trading in the Tercel for a larger car.  My husband plans on giving me the new car and keeping the Geo to drive to work.  He has always claimed the newer car, but this time I think he's attatched.  You know how men are about their cars.<br><br>
