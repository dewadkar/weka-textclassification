            It's almost that time.  Every year and a half I get the new car itch...and once I get it, it's never more than a few months before I have something else sitting in the driveway.  That next something else will be the 2001 Honda Accord Coupe.  

<b>What's New for 2001?</b>
Honda generally gives the Accord a complete makeover every four years.  The current body style dates to 1998, and the dealer announced that Honda will unveil a new Accord in 2002/2003.  Each year, however, brings some refinements.  For 2001, the Accord coupe gains a new body-color grille and sportier front bumper.  Also standard on the EX is a six-disc in-dash CD changer, traction control, and side airbags.  Open headrests are also new for this year and along with silver dash and door trim, the interior of the 2001 coupe is sportier than its predecessor.  

<b>Exterior</b>
The Accord is notoriously vanilla.  The similarities between the Accord Sedan and the Toyota Camry four-door are so remarkable that one has to wonder which company has corporate spies working at the other.  The Accord coupe is quite a bit snazzier--with a sporty wedge-shaped rear and aggressive lines along the sides. The front is basically a carry-over from the sedan, but the overall look of the car is sporty and luxurious.  Sixteen inch tires mounted on factory alloys, optional fin and optional black chrome badging further set apart the Accord I tested from the suburban mom appearance of the sedan.

<b>Interior</b>
The Coupe's interior is well appointed with high-buck plastics, the aforementioned silver dash trim, and upscale climate and radio controls. The leather seats on the model I am considering are firm and comfortable.  The leather feels thick, and is grained to hold up to wear better than most cars I have seen.  The front seats have plenty of room for most adults, although I would imagine that overhead space might feel a bit snug for the six-foot plus crowd.  The drivers seat features an eight-way power adjustment feature to allow you to find the perfect driving position.  The rear seat was adequate, though as with most coupes, getting in and out requires a bit of gymnastic skill.  Legroom in the rear would be a bit cramped for most adults.  The only two things I would change on the interior are the cheap looking headlight controls (an exact carryover from my ten-year old Prelude) and a cavernous hole where the dash meets the console (the location for the optional smokers package)--if you don't get the ashtray you are basically looking at a large &quot;bin&quot; that obviously wasn't well thought out.

<b>Driving the Accord Coupe</b>
The EX is available with either a 150 hp four or a 200 hp V-6, both with Honda's VTEC system. The V-6 was very powerful in highway cruising and passing.  The automatic transmission has been tweeked to allow smooth shifts even on hard acceleration.  And while I will probably end up opting for a four cylinder with manual transmission, the V-6 auto is a killer package.  The thing that I found most remarkable about driving the Accord was how quiet it was, especially when compared with older generation Accords that I have driven.  There was virtually no road or wind noise, even at 90 mph.

<b>Pricing, Reliability, and Resale Value</b>
A fully equipped EX coupe with leather, spoiler, and accessory badging, will run around $26,500. I feel that this is quite a value for a car that I found every bit as enjoyable as a Lexus ES300 or Acura CL (the Accords corporate clone).  Expect to pay a similar price for a Toyota Solara--a solid value, too, but one that loses out to the Accord in terms of sportiness and appearance. 
Hondas are well known for their reliability.  My stepmother's '95 EX has logged over 120,000 miles with no trips to the shop outside of normal maintenance.  Resale value is also high on Accords. Well kept examples will fetch fifty percent of their original retail cost even after 8 to 10 years of use.
Overall, the Accord coupe has everything I am looking for--good looks, reliability, luxury and performance.  It will be coming soon to a driveway near ME!<br><br>
