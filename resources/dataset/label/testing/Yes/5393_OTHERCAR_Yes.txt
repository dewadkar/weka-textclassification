            When I was considering a 3-series back in January, I was also considering a whole slew of other cars.  The Saab 9-3 vector, the Audi A4 1.8T, the Nissan 350z, and the Infinity G35. First thing first.  When you are trying to compare cars, you really should try to test drive all of the cars you are considering within a very short time span.  This will give you a fair impression of the whole group of cars.  With that said, test drive the 3-series last and it will save you time, you won't have to go back to any of the other dealers since the bimmer is what you'll end up getting.  This is my experience from Pre-owner to Current-owner of my 2003 330i sedan.  

There are 2 ways to purchase a BMW.  

1) Pick one out of the dealer lot.  (you can usually stike a better price since the dealer wants to get this car off the lot)
2) Order one with the EXACT options you want.  

I did not want to take one on the lot, so i had mine ordered.  Once a deposit is made, you will get a production number.  With that number you can track the production progress of your car on the internet using BMW's Owners Circle.  It takes about a 6-8 weeks to get your car, but this is by far the most customizable process i've ever experienced and well worth the wait.  

My impressions on the car:

Engine (9/10):
The straight-6 (engine) is one of the silkiest engines i've ever experienced. rated at 225 hp (330i)  it has plenty of power for most drivers.  I was very impressed at how the car was so responsive. 

Exterior (9/10):
The design is about 5 years old now.  It has been around for a while, but still, the 3-series looks very sleek and nice.  Not one car out there in a similar price range has had a design that has been so successful.  Most cars lose their design appeal after the first 3 years. not so with bmw.  This design is still strongly appealing after 5 years.  
(note: a newly designed 3-series is expected for 2005)

Interior (8/10): 
All controls are very well laid out.  The interior gives you a sense of Luxury. Seats are very comfortable, though the rear interior room is a little tight. BMW's have an orange accent lighting at night.  All controls, gauges, etc,are lit in orange.  

Performance (9/10):
0-60: 6.5  (motortrend tested @5.9)
that says it all.. this is a pretty fast car.  Plenty of power for me at least.  
Through the turns, this car cannot be beat.  You've heard it from most magazine reviews that BMW's have superior handling.  ALL TRUE... The handling on my 330i is superb.  The car is so stable through turns, you forget how fast you are going.  

Overall : 
A great car if you can afford the slight price premium.  You will not be disappointed.  the only con that i really see is that getting a service appointment takes about a month for my dealership.  But all is good as long as i have a BMW loaner waiting for me.  :)
