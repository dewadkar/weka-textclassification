             I have a 1995 ford escort LX model.This is my first car, and so far I haven't had any real problems with it. It is a great car, and I feel very safe in it.I got it my senior year in high school while attending boarding school in Maryland. My dad bought it new because I was going to be away from home. It has lasted many trips from South Florida to Maryland and back again. Now I am in college, and it still is running great. It has survived many a trip from North Florida back to South Florida. The gas miles on the highway is great. I am very pleased with my dads choice of car for me. It currently has 78,000 miles, and many more to go. When looking at cars, don't pass up the escort!!!!!<br><br>
