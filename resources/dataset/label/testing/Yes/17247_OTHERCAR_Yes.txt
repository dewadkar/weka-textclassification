            I've owned a 1996 Land Cruiser for the past three years, we bought it used with only a few thousand miles on it as another vehicle to compliment our Mitsubishi.  Although slightly pricey, buying it used was a great idea, it dropped 10k off the new price, but still allowed for a car in great shape.   Although not exactly what I would call an off road SUV, it still is great on the many dirt byways that rural Utah has to offer, and at the same time looks great in downtown Salt Lake.  The sound system and alarm that the original owners included have been great, it's good to see a sound package so great as a dealer option.  It also isn't lacking in power in any way, the 3.6 liter engine packs a lot of power for going up hills or hauling a boat.  If you want a great work horse, with plenty of refinement, this is the car for you.<br><br>
