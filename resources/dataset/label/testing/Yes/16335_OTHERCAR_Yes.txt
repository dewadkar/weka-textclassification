            My Hewlett Packard c200 Digital camera is the best camera I've seen for under $500.00.  This great camera features a 2x digital zoom.  With an 8mb flash memory card, you can store up to 80 pictures, and even in the lowest quality, the pictures are still better than the ones from my Poloroid Fun flash digital camera.  I would never trade this camera for another camera.  This great camera has a port on the side for you to plug an a/v cable into a T.V and instanly see that pictures you have taken on the T.V.  It features a 1 megapixel resaloution for true-to-life photo's.  I have taken this camera everywhere, it has been outside and dropped many times, and it still takes great looking pictures.  The only bad thing, like any other digital camera, the LCD screen takes a lot of battery power.  To combat this problem, I put the batteries into a battery charger every night, so I have like-new batteries every day for shooting great looking pictures.  I hope to have this camera for a long time.  I would recommend this camera to anybody.<br><br>
