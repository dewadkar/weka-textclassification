            As we got out of the restaurant one night, my girlfriend stops walking and had this stunned face like she saw a monster or something. As I set my eyes on the car that she was pointing my hart almost stop. The car was a 99 red Mercury Cougar. It was love at first site and I told her we have to test drive this car. 

That same night we went to a mercury dealer and take it for a little spin. The test drive was short but very satisfied. I kick the butt of this a little bit of it but hey! This is a test drive... Like the sound of the motor especially when you downshift! This kitten has a nice purr!

Before my divorce I had a 7 passengers Lumina truck, and since I only have the kids every 2 weeks, I dont need the truck anymore. I had lot of space in my last vehicle and I was worried to go back to cars.

A week later I bought the V6 sport equipped laser red Cougar... 
What can I say about the looks? This car just has everything to turn heads! Last summer on the busiest streets in Montreal I received comments at lease tree times a day from peoples. Even police stop me to find out about this car and this still goes on.

To drive it is fun too! I never had a sport car, so I can�t compare with others but I love to feel the road between my hand and this car is giving me this experience. The accessories and gadgets are great like the trip computer and the special features on the radio. The kids love the car too. We did a few long trips with them a no problems accept for the lack of visibility for them in back. Hey remember I had a van before this car.

I dont know why but I think the rear view mirror is to low. Is it because I had a van or its the way is should be? The room at the back seems small and had positive and negative comments about it from adult. Anyway I don�t care because it�s suppose to be a sport car and I won�t sit there!
But since I have an electric seat I still cant find the perfect position after 6 months. I dont recommend this option.

If you want a car that grabs attention and need performance but not want to drive a racecar... this is a car for you. Great price for what you get.
