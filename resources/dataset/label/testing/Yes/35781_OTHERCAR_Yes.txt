            I'm one of the first Saturn owners, back when there was little known about the company.  It was the summer of 1993, and my sister and I were car shopping for a car that our grandfather was buying us while we were in highschool.  I of course wanted to check out Jeep Wranglers and similar &quot;cool&quot; cars, but my sister had other ideas.  We were driving down the strip of car dealers, and my sister suggested we check out the Saturn dealership as she had heard good things.  We left that evening with a new car!

Neither of us new what we were getting ourselves into as first generation Saturn owners.  There hadn't been enough time to find out what was going to happen to the car five years down the road, but here we are, almost seven years later, and my trusty Saturn is still running beautifully.  (The car is all mine now, and my sister got her own Saturn a few years later.) First of all, I've never had a major repair on the car (of course, now that I've written this, the transmission will probably blow today!).  Ive put over 60,000 miles on the car, which really isn't that much, and have had the battery replaced, and two new tires put on. (That was suggested when I took it in to be serviced before I drove cross country, which I thought was a good idea before driving 3,000 miles.)  Other than that, Ive had a windshield wiper replaced and a small repair on the window that seemed to be leaking a bit.  The only other services this car has had are oil changes.  

The car runs smoothly and comfortably.  It can make it up all the hills in San Francisco but definitely is sluggish, although I find the manual transmission to be helpful extra power.  (It did have a tough time crossing the Rockies but made it through just fine!)  The car handles well on the roads, both in the city and on highway at speeds up to 80 mph.  However, taking it to the mountains isnot fun!  It does not handle well in snow, and actually driving in heavy rain seems to slip around a bit.  I have gotten into a fender bender, and the other car was much more severly damaged, proving those Saturn bumpers work after all.

Comfort comes from affordable features like power windows and locks, a sun roof (which actually doesnt open into the roof, but above, so the sun roof is actually smaller when open than it appears, a drawback for some), power steering, and cassette player.  The seats are relatively roomy, but the car is low, so very tall people might be a bit uncomfortable.

Perhaps the best deal is the cost.  Since we were on a budget from the grandpa, we were looking for an economy car (thus, the Jeep Wrangler was ruled out almost immediately.)  Back in 1993 I think we shelled out somewhere in the $13,000 range, for the SL1 model, which isn't the top of the line, but definitely had alot of added features.

The car gets great gas mileage, I believe somewhere in the low 30 miles to the gallon, less for city driving of course.  The service we were given at the dealership was phenomenal.  (My grandfather like the car and the dealer so much he went back to buy himself one!)  We were treated like we had won the lottery, with candy and an announcement over the load speaker, and a birthday song too!  Service has been great when I have gone back to take the car in, which actually hasnt been that often. (I tend to get the oil changed at cheaper service locations.)  When I needed my leaky window repaired, there was an incredibly long wait, but the service guy fixed it immediately, saying it wouldnt take that long and he didnt want me to have to bring it back.  

All in all, I have found my Saturn a great, economical, safe car.  It is still running wonderfully after seven years of driving hard!<br><br>
