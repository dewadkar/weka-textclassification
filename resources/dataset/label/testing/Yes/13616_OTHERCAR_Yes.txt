            I came back to Chevy, and it was the right choice. My S-10 extended cab has a surprising amount of cab room. The dash organization and detailing is user friendly. The 60-40 split bench seat is girlfriend friendly.

I got the big Vortec engine, and I just blow cars away at lights. Great acceleration, and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly and without hesitation.

Gas mileage is running 16 mpg or so, with lots of air conditioning use bringing that down. I have the long bed, and that's plenty of room for what I haul.

Back end is light and braking while hitting a bump tends to trigger the antilocks, but that's what they're designed to do.

Very smooth ride. Large turn radius, but that may just be me getting used to a bigger vehicle.<br><br>
