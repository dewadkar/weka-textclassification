            My husband bought our Metro in 1990. He was commuting 45 minutes one way to work, and wanted to take advantage of its advertised great mileage. What an understatement! He ended up getting 50 miles to the gallon,and it handled great on the curvy mountain highway he traveled on a daily basis. 

Easy to drive, perfect for long hauls. We even took it on a 3 week camping trip. We were amazed at how much we could fit into the hatch-back space!And not just the storage area. My husband is 6 feet, 5 inches tall, and all he had to do to fit into the Metro was to lay his seat back slightly.  

This car is perfect for people who drive a lot, especially for students, who are usually on a tight budget. Our car was a program car, which meant low mileage, and a very affordable price. The only drawback to having this car is that it is not geared as a family car. We had no children at the time, so it was perfect for us. After we had our child, we then used it as a second car, when just one of us need to run errands. 

We really loved our little blue car!<br><br>
