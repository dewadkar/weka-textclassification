            <b>History</b>
Maserati has always had its ups and downs, being the possession of many owners and always being on the verge of financial bankruptcy. Throughout history however they have produced very special cars in very limited numbers. Every car has been special in its own right, a relic of the hand made industry that only a few manufacturers world wide still practice. The racing heritage of the marquee, combined with the exclusiveness of the brand, has always heralded something special. Maserati has been producing high performance sports cars since 1947 and since then has released a number of high performance two doors or GT (Grand Tourer) cars. These include the early model Ghibli, Mexico, Indy, Mistral, Sebring, Bora, Khamsin, Kyalami, Merak and the 3500.  The Bi-Turbo of the 1980&#146s does not come under this guise as it is smaller bodied and smaller engined. The number of two door models produced over the years is quite vast for a small company such as Maserati. 

However in the Late 1990&#146s Maserati unveiled their new two-door model, the 3200GT to see the company through financially as the Quattroporte of the time was mid way through its life cycle. It was also produced to once again break into the lucrative US markets that Maserati was forced to withdraw from in the late 1980&#146s. The 3200GT is a car that is in a niche market, a direct competitor to the other exclusive, sports aspirated coupes that are around today. Examples of the 3200GT&#146s competitors are the Jaguar XKR, Porsche 911, Mercedes CL-Class and the Aston Martin DB7. So as not to confuse you, Maserati has dropped the 3200GT name and replaced it with a simple &#147Coupe&#148 as the car has just been mildly revised and fitted with a large engine making the 3200 (3200cc) name obsolete while maintaining a remarkably similar but somewhat revised same body shape. I recently test-drove a new Maserati Coupe Cambiocorsa model.

<b>Appearance</b> 9.5/10
The Maserati Coupe is exactly what its name suggests, a two door coupe. It is not any old two door either, this car has a certain flair that Italian cars are renowned for. This car isn&#146t styled like a Ferrari, nor is it meant to be. Maserati have always produced understated sports cars, comparable to that of Aston Martin. You will only notice the Maserati Coupe if you are beside it or behind it, it isn&#146t the sort of car you crane your neck to see when it is half a mile down in the traffic. Maserati produces cars for those that can see past the Ostentatious ways of the world.

You would not be wrong in suggesting that the Maserati looked faintly like an Aston Martin DB7, the under ties are certainly there with the long bonnet, and a swooping roofline that seems to end at the end of the boot lid. Notable changes to the new model are a more prominent bonnet and revised grille. The bonnet now has no cooling vents in it leaving a more clean design. The heavily criticised rear taillights, which appeared to be &#147boomerang&#148 in their styling, have been dropped to make way for more boring, but eye pleasing numbers. The car is very curvaceous, and I think most, if not all will find it appealing. Like a piece of driveable Italian art. Inevitably this car will become a sought after second hand model because of its looks. There is of course an infinite range of choices for paint colour, and I felt the need to specially mention this. You can choose the normal colours Maserati offers for AUD $2495, or for an additional AUD $5295 you can have special Ferrari paint on your Maserati. Ferrari Racing Red anyone? Of course if you so desire and your wallet can cope, you can have special paint by sample for a monstrous AUD $10 995. That means that if you like the peach of your sister-in-laws lounge room of the mustard green of your mother&#146s carpet then you can have that colour on your car, provided you give a sample of that colour. The interior is much the same, but I will get to that later.

<b>Interior and Accommodation</b>
<b><I>Quality</b></I> 4.5/5
As Maserati is a marquee which is hand made, you cannot expect machine like precision as in Japanese cars. What you can expect however is that hand made craftsmanship that you just do not get in normal cars. Quality is very much improved over cars from the 1980&#146s such as the Bi-Turbo inspired models, which were notorious for the electrical gremlins and leather, and wooden interiors that disintegrated with sun and everyday use. These worries seem a thing of the past these days, Maserati has an upgraded factory and a retrained work force. The most recent Quattroporte do not seem to rust, which was a disease that used to affect all Maserati models so maybe finally they have their act together. 

The Coupe which I test drove seemed rather impeccable in its construction. Apart from a few gaps in the leather-stitched dashboard, quality seems to be impeccable. It has to be said that you will only find plastic on the buttons in the car, the rest of the interior is covered in Connelly leather, Carpet and Wood grain/Carbon Fibre if you select it. The old briarwood interiors of previous generation Maserati models are gone, a pity in my own opinion. This car certainly has the opulence of a Bentley or Rolls Royce, but with a sportier note to it. 

Maserati is a brand, which has always built beautiful interiors, but with this model it can be taken one step further. Let us start with the basics. Maserati used to provide a golden clock as the centrepiece of their interiors, now it is absent but is an option. Some what call it kitsch; I would call it part of Maserati. I guess that is why it is in option. If you so desire, it is yours for AUD $795. It must be said that in a Maserati most surfaces are covered in leather. However you can take this a few dozen steps further. You can specify your own coloured leather interior, and have that colour leather applied to the dashboard (upper, lower or both), the doors (upper, lower or both), the colour of the leather of the steering wheel, a ripped leather roof lining and you can even specify what colour stitching you would like. Lastly you can have Maserati add special doorsill plates to your car.

<b><I>Ease of Use</b></I> 4/5
Let it be said that Maserati are not renowned for their ergonomic superiority. Switches in strange places as well as interesting driving positions seemed to be the norm for Italian manufacturers who put driving comfort behind driving performance and handling. Slowly however things are beginning to change. The Coupe is a lot better than previous models however it still is not perfect. The steering wheel and seat adjust clumsily, but the driving position is much improved on that of previous cars. Gauges and instrumentation are easy to see and read, and all other controls are where you expect them to be, and many of them are analogue, which is something I like. Maserati has been a manufacturer which hasn&#146t latched onto &#147the more LCDs the better&#148. Less satisfactory however is the obscure placement of the driver&#146s footrest.
 
<b><I>Seating</b></I> 4/5
The seating in the Coupe is very good for a Maserati. The seats have been increased in their size since previous models and Maserati seems to be listening to their customers. The 3200GT was criticised for not having a cushion that was long enough, the Coupe model fixes this complaint. The thick cushioning and excellent side bolstering of the front seats and to a lesser extent the rear seats means that you will always stay in your place through fast cornering and spirited driving. Naturally on a car of this price the seats are electrically adjustable.  Interestingly heated seats are an option, an outrageous emission on a car of this price. The Red leather on my car really did complement the interior well, why is it only Italians seem to be able to get away with this sort of interior style?

<b><I>Technology</b></I> 2.5/5
Maserati seems to have concentrated most of the technology on this car within the engine and gearbox. Sure there are things in this car which other people might consider pretty modern, and yes this car has plenty of these things however there is nothing ground breaking. Parking sensors and Xenon Headlamps are available as is an electro chromatic rear view mirror, which automatically dims the rear view mirror for you.

<b><I>Heating and Ventilation</b></I> 4/5
Climate Control is standard, but the controls are analogue, much like the system Mercedes-Benz  use in their SL-Class. I think it is an excellent idea, who wants confusing LCD screens to control simple tasks such as climate control? The new climate control system is well suited to the Australian environment as it is quite powerful and perfectly adequate unlike previous efforts by Maserati. Less satisfactory however is the reach you have to make to change the controls, which is all the way down near the gear stick.

<b><I>Sound System</b></I> 5/5
The sound system in the Coupe is really quite excellent. Unlike other Italian manufacturers who insist on keeping a sound system as an option so you can listen to the engine are just trying to justify the fact that they want to make maximum profit out of every car. Maserati is different. You get an excellent 8-speaker system with CD Player. For a few additional thousand dollars you can upgrade the sound system to the &#147Auditorium 200 Hi-Fi system&#148 with CD auto-changer. Never the less the system equipped to my car (the base system) was clear, loud and perfectly adequate. Equable to that of the Mercedes-Benz SL500.

<b><I>Safety and Security</b></I> 3.5/5
Safety is taken rather seriously in this new model, with driver and passenger airbags being standard as well as front side airbags. An immobiliser is there to protect your investment along with remote locking but sadly an alarm system is an option.

<b><I>Storage and Space</b></I> 3.5/5
The new Maserati Coupe is a genuine 2 2. Meaning that it has the capability to seat 2 people easily and 2 more occasionally. While the length of the car hasn&#146t extended over the 3200GT the wheelbase has allowing for more interior space, especially to those in the rear. I am quite a tall man, and my legs fitted reasonably well but headroom was still a bit of a problem. I guess that beautiful shape has to have some trade offs. Something which you may want  to consider if you have children or want to carry more than the wife. Interior storage space is adequate, with a few compartments scattered around the interior. Of course you could always option the leather rear seat storage compartment for AUD $ 1995 or the designer Maserati luggage kit which fits neatly into your boot for AUD $5995.

<b>Engine and Handling</b> 18.5/20
<b><I>Engine and Performance</b></I> 10/10
I was expecting something great from this new 4.2 Litre V8 and I wasn&#146t wrong. In my last Maserati review, the Quattroporte, which was fitted with a 3.2 litre V8 engine, I called the experience terrifying.  As you start the engine a very deep, but restrained burble. You know something fast, something capable of producing illegal speeds extremely quickly lies beneath. Once you change into gear (more on that later) and accelerate an evil grin will come to your face. The car transforms into a rocket. The accelerator now has a gradual, positive feedback to it, unlike the 3200GT, which acted more as an &#147on/off&#148 switch. The 4.2 Litre engine weighs only 184 kilograms thanks to aluminium construction. The power of the engine does not fool you either, 0-100km/h in 4.9 seconds, which brings it into the league of the Porsche 911 Turbo and various Ferrari models. That is what 390 Horsepower does!!! Although I doubt any of us will ever test the car to it&#146s capacity, you can rest easy knowing you have a 285km/h top speed.

The Maserati Coupe <B><I>Cambiocorsa</b></I> literally means &#147race change&#148. A popular form of transmission these days is an automatic with manual shifting and that is roughly what the Cambiocorsa model adds to the Coupe. Considering the extra price of the Cambiocorsa you would expect a little more, and you get it. The transmission has three different shift modes: Standard, Auto and Sport. The &#147sport&#148 mode is like the &#147standard&#148 (manual) but with quicker shifts. If you have the special suspension fitted the gearbox communicates with it and adjusts the dampening accordingly. I found this gearbox to deliver so much more than other gearboxes of the same variety I have driven. It seems to focus more on the manual aspect of shifting rather than the auto, which I consider a good thing. Then again this is a sports car but I see it as a shame when manufacturers fit automatic gearboxes to sports cars. The manual selection is via paddles located on the steering wheel, enabling to feel like a real F1 driver. A highly competent system in my own opinion.

<b><I>Handling</b></I> 8.5/10
One of the Coupe&#146s greatest attributes is its comfortable ride, which can be adjusted according to your requirements. Normally the suspension remains very composed and supple, almost luxury car like. However it can be adjusted into sport mode which does firm everything up but does not give you a bone jarring ride as can be associated with other &#147sports suspensions&#148. Steering remains quick and accurate as well as being well weighted. Unfortunately I didn&#146t have the opportunity for an extended drive so I cannot comment how the car handles on more challenging roads.

<b>Ownership</b>
<b><I>Insurance</b></I> 2/5
Insurance is very expensive, as can be expected with owning a sports exotic such as a Maserati. Unlike previous Maseratis depreciation is not nearly as bad, and you can expect a somewhat reasonable return of around 63% after 3 years. Of course these are Australian figures and expect them to vary drastically in overseas markets.

<b><I>Maintenance</b></I> 3.5/5
Maserati is renowned to produce high  maintenance and expensive cars but the new Coupe is different. While costs will always be at a premium compared to other makes, the absurd costs demanded by the dealer should be a thing of the past. I am a member of the Maserati Club and have heard stories from other members of situations of oil changes costing AUD $300 and simple rubber seals costing four to five times that of the usual price. The new engine as well as more conventional electronics and other systems should see an end to this.

<b>Final Evaluation</b>
The Maserati Coupe Cambiocorsa is an exquisite automobile and it is indeed an improved version of the 3200GT that I drove a few years back.  It too does represent a changing for Maserati, a renaissance if you like. Maserati is improving quality, performance, comfort and style more than ever. This car will no doubt stand out as one of the more impressive Maserati models, and I expect it to go well in the US markets, despite the high prices.

In all truthfulness the Maserati is a superb blend of Porsche 911 Turbo combined with the Jaguar XKR. A perfect blend of the precision sports of the Porsche with the class and luxury of the Jaguar. A truly Italian car, with the quirks (which most of us hated but true enthusiasts loved) gone will make it a much more justifiable purchasing proposition. The blistering performance, which rivals that of the greater Italian exotic car at a significantly reduced price when compared to the exorbitant prices of a Ferrari or Lamborghini (even if the price itself is still rather expensive). In all, a worthy, if somewhat individual choice in this exclusive niche market.
