            In mid-October I discovered my poor old Toyota was facing some repair dollars that I didn't want to spend. I drive at least 40 K per year (mostly &quot;highway&quot;) and need a vehicle that will &quot;get me there&quot;.

My choices were a Kia Sephia (98) with 4500 miles or an auto that was a few years older with ten times the mileage. I opted for the Sephia.

The car impressed my with it's nice handling. It�s even got some &quot;spunk&quot;: especially in the 50 MPH to 70 MPH range-crucial on country roads. It looks like all the other cars of its ilk (people don't laugh until they are close enough to read the name-plate.)

My first problem was an inability to fill the gas tank. The pump's automatic shutoff kept activating. With my 36K, factory' warranty I visited the dealer (not where it was purchased).

They explained that the gas tank contained a sensor that will shut off the fuel flow if the car is upside down. Mine was faulty and was reacting to gas from the pump. �We'll replace your tank,� said the dealer. 

As I sat in the waiting room, the mechanic suggested that the front-to-rear wiring contained a connector that was vulnerable to moisture. &quot;Want me to replace the wiring?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;

Next he asked if the brakes had a tendency to &quot;pulse&quot; when depressed. I frankly didn't know. Mechanic now said, &quot;Might be a future problem. I'll replace the front disk assembly&quot;. 

A while later I wandered into the bay. The exhaust system was lying on the floor. Mechanic's comment: &quot;Muffler looked like it might separate. I'm replacing it&quot;.
A leak was fixed, the cigarette lighter replaced and the car was washed.
Price $0.00

Can any Mercedes owner match this warranty service? (Although no new(ish) car should need this effort. I personally am very impressed.

This is a<b>May 2000</b> update. I've put about 14,000 miles on the Kia. Still fairly happy. Gas mileage has ranged from the mid thirties in bad weather to the low forties in recent weeks. Note: We've rented automatic transmission Kias. Performance and gas mileage (in the 20's) were nothing to boast about. Get standard! No more problems on this one save a little moisture buildup in the drivers door: noticeable when the windows are &quot;rolled up/down&quot; after rain. Will have the dealer rectify soon before the rust devils appear.

A comment on Kia's radio (and all the others). With nineteen tiny buttons: some you push, once, twice, thrice, others hold down for 5 seconds etc., car radios really are a safety issue. Can't do much without taking your eyes off of the road.

Now an <b>August 2000</b> update.
The Sephia now has 24,000 miles: closing in on the end of the warranty. It�s still a fairly fun car to drive but the front tires are totally gone (steel belt visible on one!). The dealer explained that the �factory� tires are not of high quality. No warranty: spent $100.

I had been hearing a weird humming noise from the engine compartment. Kia replaced the power steering pump and all associated links. There was a recall on the wipers and fuel pump (plus one more item I can�t decode). Those were replaced.

The mechanic noted a leak in the rear struts and resealed them.

As above, these things should not happen <i>but</i> the dealer service is superb. 

I�ll keep you posted.
