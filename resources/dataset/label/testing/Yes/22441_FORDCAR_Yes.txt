            I purchased my 1999 Ford Ranger not to long ago and am totally happy with what I have experienced so far. This category covers only your basic Ranger but I don�t have one of those. Instead, this opinion will be about my 4x4 Ford Ranger XLT.

My white 4x4 step side is a dream to drive. I chose to go with the automatic 6-cylinder model and circumstances led me to end up with a four-wheel drive. Bonus for me. My particular truck is an extended cab version that features four doors and something that I highly suggest to anyone looking for a good work truck. The added space is worth the few extra hundred added to the total package price.

Although the salesman tried to steer me towards a red Ranger real hard that is one color that shouldn�t be purchased if you have even the slightest lead foot for which I have often been accused of.

All of the new Rangers come with a CD player, cassette, and AM-FM radio that pumps out pretty good sound at a respectable sound level. Mine is no exception. I have absolutely no complaints as far as the music system is concerned.

The interior is laid out extremely well with four-cup holders up front including two more in the rear between the jump seats. There are coin holders as well as a center console for CD�s or whatever else you may want to put there. A very comfortable armrest folds down over the center console.

To engage the four-wheel drive you merely turn a knob to 4x4 high or 4x4 low. You should have O/D (overdrive) turned off and be traveling at a relatively low speed when you switch into 4x4 to save your transmission and gears. I haven�t torn it up enough in 4x4 to really tell you how great it is in the dirt but it has gotten me out of a few mud holes so far. Low 4x4 seems to pull real strong on the few hills that I have climbed.

The 6-cylinder engine hums along very nicely. I do most of my driving on the highway and typically cruise at about 75-80 mph. I get roughly 20 mpg on the highway at these speeds so I would bet you would get slightly better mileage at a lower speed. Stop and go city traffic is no problem for the auto trans and I find it nicer than my last manual transmission.

My overall experience with my Ford Ranger XLT 4x4 has been a positive one. I can highly recommend the Ranger as a fantastic mid sized truck capable of handling your everyday work needs.
