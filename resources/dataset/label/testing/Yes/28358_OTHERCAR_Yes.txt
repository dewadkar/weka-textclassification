            <b>The W220 generation of Mercedes are massively different to that of the previous generation W140. The much-awaited car was released in 1999 and promised to be lighter, faster and cheaper than its predecessor. The car was made to compete with the BMW 7 Series and the Lexus LS430. As the jewel in Mercedes Benz�s crown, the S-Class had to be good, and better than its predecessor, which was criticised for being too heavy and too excessive. The BMW 7-Series had been taking a large percentage of the luxury car market and Mercedes needed to fight back. The new car brought with it many technological advances, and some of these were so advanced that it took the world in awe. For the first time in many years, BMW was playing catch-up.</b>

In 2001 I began looking for a new car. Having just come to Australia from Germany I was very surprised at the purchase price, insurance prices and fuel prices here and decided I could afford a top line luxury limousine. At the time I was in awe with the new Mercedes S-Class and it was on my shopping list for a while. However a few shortcomings turned me to look elsewhere. Eventually I decided on a BMW 750iL The car I tested was the S500L with a couple of options.


<b>Styling</b>

The W220 S-Class signified a new beginning for Mercedes-Benz. They had adopted a fresh new style, in an attempt to lure younger customers and �shake off� their old person�s image. Put simply, the new S-Class is very striking. The first thing I noticed was that the car appeared smaller, which in turn it is. The previous S-Class was larger, in all dimensions but appeared even bigger. Disappointingly the Mercedes style grille had disappeared however the new grille was rather attractive with rounded lines and simple horizontal chrome striping. The three-pointed star still adorns the long sloping bonnet (Thankfully). One thing I particularly liked from the front of the car was the headlights. The unit was integrated all in one resulting in a very clean look. The front headlights on the S-Class high discharge Xenon, which produce a very wide spread of crisp white light. An innovative feature is having the indicators in the side of the mirrors enabling other drivers to see your intentions when turning more easily. One thing to remember is this car is available with many different Alloy Wheels as well as an AUD $13 000 AMG Sports Kit.

Whenever I see a W220 S-Class from the side it always seems it has been styled with a piece of ribbon. The lines of the car seem to flow as if it has been designed with total drag co efficiency in mind. The S-Class is a beautiful car. It has been styled in a most appealing way, and you would be hard pressed to find someone who did not like the styling. Nevertheless the S-Class did retain the �imposing� look with the stern front headlights (they seem to me like a teacher�s pair of eyes) as well as the beautiful curved line of the car. The line curves gently up from the headlights and finishes elegantly at the rear taillights. From the rear the car retains typical Mercedes simplicity. Simple LED taillights adorn either side of the car and the sloping boot line works in harmony with the rest of the car. The car has fairly small amounts of chrome, complementing the simple design of the car. The LED taillights serve a purpose: being able to warn the driver 50 milliseconds faster - it is supposed to be a safety feature however I doubt its credibility. <b>The styling of the car certainly looks good in photographs but seeing it in the flesh does tend to stir your emotions.</b> It is that type of car. You would be hard pressed to find anybody that did not like the styling of the W220 S-Class.


<b>Interior and Accommodation</b>

As I had the S-Class for 3 days, I was able to experience the S-Class fully. I have to say that I did and still do have mixed feelings about the S-Class. The interior is a mix of luxurious space and just plain stupidity. This is the first Mercedes ever to have an ergonomically inferior cabin. Buttons are scattered everywhere! I remember counting something like 20 buttons on the driver�s door alone. The COMAND system which combines controls for DVD Navigation, Radio, Cassette Deck, CD Changer, Sound System, Telephone and TV is a good idea in theory, but the way it is controlled and positioned make it impossible to use quickly and easily. The whole system is based entirely around a colour monitor in the front dashboard. A keypad and a small directional controller with other buttons control it. The thing I found most difficult was remembering what all the buttons did, they were organised in a disorganised fashion and were remarkably similar in their design so distinguishing them was a seemingly impossible task. For the price of the car the screen looks cheap and performs cheaply too. A touch screen would be the only way this mess could be solved. The instruments run on a similar system to that on the LS400/430. The screen is black until you turn the key until everything springs to life.  In the field of ergonomics I found the BMW 7-Series to be vastly superior.

The materials used on the S-Class also seem to be a cut below both Lexus and BMW. While the optional Exclusive Nappa Leather option was fitted to my car was beautiful (The Exclusive Leather denotes the covering of rear shelf, centre console and instrument being trimmed in leather, the roof and pillars in Alcantara) I couldn�t help feel that the plastics were only of an average standard. This is not the usual case in German cars. The Exclusive leather is a very expensive option, at AUD $12 600 you get to choose from almost any colour or any material under the sun, and although it wasn�t offered I am sure you could probably get elephant leather or something just as rare. The plastic seems to cover an awful lot of car: doors and trims and near the gearshift. The gearshift area is quite ugly, a gross waste of space with a clashing of lines. Nothing like this ever happened in the old Mercedes Benz S-Class. The polished wood veneer in my car was the burr walnut, however chestnut and calyptus were also available.

I was eagerly anticipating the new seats in this car. They were heated and cooled! Seat cooling was a first for a car, which both Lexus and BMW have now copied. How wrong I was. I found the seats to be flat, providing little cornering support. The beautifully soft leather did not seem to compensate for this terrible fault. Both the front and rear seats seem rather low which I found to be rather uncomfortable on a long trip. The seats are fully electrically adjustable with memory. The rear seats can be optioned electrically in conjunction with rear seat heating, rear seat cooling, as well as dynamic contour front and rear seats for AUD $4798. The Dynamic Contour seats work on the principle of inflating and deflating air cushions and can even be made to massage your lower back. For another AUD $3400 you can have separate climate control for both sides of the rear seats (meaning the car can have 4 different temperature zones!). A second television monitor for the rear can be added for AUD $4600. As you can see this car is one in which many options are available just concerning the configuration of the interior. Interior space is at an optimum in both the front and rear. Even with the seat in its most rearward of travel the back seat occupants have plenty of space. A nice feature of the car was the entry and exit assistance system. When the key was removed the steering wheel pivots up to allow for a more comfortable and graceful entry.

The Bose sound system fitted to the car I drove was superb, it however is an option. The steering wheel operated controls make operation much easier. A feature in the S500L, which I appreciated, was Parktronic. Parktronic assists in parking this large limousine via a series of audible beeps and a display on either side of the dashboard letting you know when you are too close to other objects. An excellent safety feature is the driving light sensor. The headlights on the car adapt to the ambient lighting so you never forget to turn your lights on. Disappointingly Linguatronic (Voice activated command system) is not available in Australia but it is able to understand a variety of accents. The Distronic Cruise Control (Cruise Control that can automatically vary speed according to traffic etc.) is also unavailable in Australia.


<b>Engine, Handling and Safety</b>

Normally I don�t include a safety segment in my car reviews but I felt that this car is set a number of important benchmarks. Firstly the S500L has a total of eight airbags: driver, passenger, all 4 doors and window bags. The brakes on the S500L are impressive. A computer can detect emergency stops by the amount of pressure the driver puts on the brake pedal and the system recognises this and builds up maximum brake power. Mercedes claims this reduces stoping distances by up to 11 metres � which could save lives. The brakes are equipped with ABS preventing the wheels from locking on unstable or slippery surfaces.

ESP or Electronic Stability Control intervenes with the car is in danger or skidding. The system can apply brakes on any of the four wheels independently as well as control engine power. The system is fully operational on dry and wet surfaces, gravel, snow and ice. While driving the car I encountered its use on gravel (I was notified by a large flashing yellow triangle in the instrument console) and the system handled the gravel with ease.

The AIRmatic Suspension provides one of the smoothest most luxurious rides in the business. The system uses air filled spring struts, which are electronically controlled and stay level at all times. The suspension can be raised or lowered according to road conditions. At higher speeds the system automatically lowers the car. AIRmatic is combined with ADS or Adaptive Dampening System, which can control the dampening force at each wheel according to road conditions and the driver. A switch can adjust the stiffness of the ride; I tried both settings but could barely tell the difference.

The handling of the S500L is simply superb. The car is direct, smooth and comfortable at all times. I encountered little, if any at all body roll and I always felt in control with both steering and suspension. The car feels very nimble and controlled, almost as if you were driving a proper sports car. You can drive thorough curves with speed and confidence with the S-Class. This aspect is one of the S-Class� major strengths. The adaptive 5-speed automatic has a manual capacity but I see little use for the system. I found it to be fairly responsive although in manual mode the gearshifts were rather slow.

The 5.0 litre V8 equipped with the S500L is very powerful and very fast. The car could accelerate from 0-100km/h is approximately 6.5 seconds. I found it very easy to stay on the speed limit (I find that my 7-Series tends to sneak up in its speed) and there was always adequate power when it was desired. Power is delivered very evenly and with relative serenity. The engine comes in various other forms: A 3.2 Diesel (S320 CDI), 3.2 V6 (S320), 4.3 V8 (S430) and 5.8 V12 (S600). 


<b>Final Evaluation</b>

The W220 S-Class is a superb luxury car. It does nothing wrong, however I feel that in Mercedes-Benz�s effort to make their cars more youthful, they have lost that trait that was unmistakable on the old S-Class: Quality. The interior is certainly luxurious, although it leaves you wanting more. Some may even call certain aspects of it cheap or tacky. The dynamics of the S-Class are an excellent mix of sports-luxury with the latter being more prominent but still with a considerable sporty flavour to it. The car is certainly a beautiful, and that is something that may sway some buyers away from the new 7-Series that it competes against. 

If you want an excellent luxurious limousine with sporty undertones, the W220 Mercedes-Benz S-Class should definitely be on your list. The car does nothing wrong, and its shortcomings are greatly overshadowed by its strengths.


<I>Note: For those wondering why I pitched a V12 BMW 750iL against a V8 Mercedes S430 it is for the following reasons � The BMW had roughly the same power engine, even with the larger capacity and the price difference between the V12 BMW and V12 Mercedes was around AUD $90 000 higher in BMW�s favour.</I>
