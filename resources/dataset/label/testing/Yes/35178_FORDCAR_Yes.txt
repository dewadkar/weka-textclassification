            I bought a new 1999 Ford Escort about five months ago and have been very happy with it.  My first car was a Chevy Nova.  Then I had a Buick Skyhawk and a Mitsubichi Mirage.  When I was ready for a new car this time, I didn't even think of looking at a Ford until I did some research online.  The many positive findings about Ford convinced me.

The Ford Escort is a well-built small car that is very reasonably priced.  I have never bought all the &quot;frills&quot;, such as power windows and locks, but this time I got such a good deal that I went for the extras.  The Escort feels much more solid and heavier than my previous Mirage.  It handles very well on the road, has great pickup and gets good mileage.  It has a very good safety record.  Check out the framework around the engine.  It's built so that if you have a front impact, the car folds like an accordion and the engine slides backwards.

It's a great little car for the money.

Sincerely,

Marjorie Cunningham
