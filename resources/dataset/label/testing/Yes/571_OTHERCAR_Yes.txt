            Pros.

-This car is great car that takes me to work and back.  I got 34MPG driving 70MPH everyday on the highway.  I get about 340 miles per tank full.  I'm sure it would get more if I drove the speed limit, but oh well. 

-Smooth ride.  Yea, it rides like a Cadillac, but also likes to bottom out on large humps.

-I'm 6'2" and am pretty comfortable driving it.  The seats are pretty good for a cheap car.  Seating in back is like any other compact....tight.

-The clutch presses down very easily.  But it took about 5k miles to get the whine out of the transmission.  I guess the gears were wearing in.  The gears don't shift too well when you get it going over 5,000 RPM.  It does peel wheels in 1st and 2nd.
  

Cons.
-Drivers side seat window did not roll up smoothly after 5k miles. Warrantee fixed problem for free.

-The water pump broke on it when it had 22K miles. Had to pay $43 for rental since i did not make appointment to get fixed.  (Sorry if I can't predict when car will break) Warrantee fixed, Paid for rental.

-Radio hole round.  It made replacing the tape deck a hassle.  I could not find a kit to fit a aftermarket CD player so I had to make one myself.

-The car don't accelerate good when the Air Condition is ON. The AC don't work that well either compared to other cars.

-This car likes to slide when it's wet out.  So plan your turns in advance.

-Front end bottom 2 round holes look stupid empty.  The Korean version has fog lights in the holes, but the lights are not available in USA.

-If you don't get a clock, there's a stupid hole in the dashboard.  I stick my Motorola 8260 cell phone in it.
