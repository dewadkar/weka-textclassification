            I own a green 1998 Ford Escort ZX2. It wasn't even a consideration at first, as I was looking at other Ford models. But thanks to the great recommendation of my sales rep, I sat in the ZX2 and instantly fell in love. 
Since I am a petite woman, the ZX2 fits to my body and doesn't make me feel as if I need a few phone books to boost me up. The model I chose included power windows, locks, cruise control and an amazing little power sunroof that still excites me everytime I open it, even after a year of ownership.
And the ZX2 is quick. It has great pick-up and is extremely quiet. We love to take it on trips because it gets about 28 miles to the gallon on the highway. The stereo system fits the car perfectly, with 4 speakers and a cassette player as a standard option. 
Even my signifigant other, a species of male who won't drive a car unless it defines his masculinity, has commented that he was suprised how quick my car was, being a Ford and all. It's the kind of car that you'll be doing 90 in and not even realize it because it is so smooth.
There aren't many things about my car that I don't like. I did buy custom seat covers because the colors of interior seem to bit on the light side.
I haven't had any problems with the car either. I did have someone bend my antenna when they had nothing better to do, and it wouldn't shape back. I replaced it at the Ford dealership no problem.
This also isn't a car to take four friends on a cross-country trip in. The backseat is rather small and it can get tight for taller folks. But going into the purchase I wanted something sporty. And usually sporty means small. I believe this car was retired for the new Ford Focus. I still believe the ZX2 is the better-looking of the two, because I can't tell you how many times I get compliments on my car. 
I have had my share of new cars that make you regret the purchase just months after the deal is done. But I still stand back and admire my ZX2 every time I wash her. She's definitely going to be with me for a while.
