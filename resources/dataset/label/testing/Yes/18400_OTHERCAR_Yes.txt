                In 1991 Mazda launched the MX-3 in both the Infamous  1.6 4-cylinder version, and the legendary 1.8 liter V6 GS model. Although comparatively late in the scene of performance subcompacts, the MX-3 caused quite a stir with its tiny V6 engine, at 1.8 liters, this V6 was smallest in the world. 


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

    Driving the GS model, Equipped with the 1.8 liter DOHC V6, pumping out 130 horses at 6,500 RPM, and 115 lb-ft of torque at 4,500 RPM, your first impression centers around this small displacement V6 engine. While not the most powerful in its class, it has more of a turbine-smooth quality to it than most gasoline powered 4-cylinders. 

Despite what one might think, this engine allows for excellent <b>acceleration,</b> which can boast better 0-60 than many cars of this time period, and matches the performance of many larger engined powered cars. 
With a Curb weight of only 2,500 lbs, the 130 horses are more than adequate to move this light-weight around town without much fuss. Freeway driving is somewhat quiet, hills are accomplished without too much engine noise, but usually steep hills require a down-shift into 4th gear from 5th. Bumps are taken by the suspension without jiggling you to death, but don't get me wrong, a car in this category is not going to be bump free, especially a '92 model with 110,000 miles as was on my tester. Wind noise is a slight factor, my Test car, a long time friends, had 110,000 original miles and it still takes to the road with enthusiasm. The Turn-in is crisp, body roll is minimal, and there is plenty of grip from the tires. This car is very entertaining to drive! 
<b>Braking</b> is good, with a 4-wheel discs, and an optional ABS set-up, stopping from high speeds was no problem, even with 110,000 miles the brakes did not feel spongy, nor did they show any signs of age. 

<b>NOTE:</b> A 4-speed automatic is optional, and despite the 150 MPH speedo, the top speed is reported to be around 125 MPH, so don't let yourself down by trying to reach the 150 MPH mark. 


  The FWD MX-3 rides on a small 96.3" wheelbase, and has an overall length of 165.7" The MX-3 uses an all independent <b>suspension.</b> Macpherson struts and coils are carried  to both the front and rear, along with anti-roll bars.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

  The <b>Interior</b> is typical of most early '90s Japanese compact automobiles. Ergonomics are good, but everything is left very simple, and interior sophistication is left to be desired. The steering wheel is thick, the seats supportive with good bolstering, but both the front and rear of this car is very cramped. The rear seats are merely molded cushions with a single flat backrest between them. Some amenity features on my GS model included AC, cruise control, sunroof, power everything, 5 speed manual, and a decent sound system. Many of these amenities are not even options on the base model which is equipped with the 1.6 liter, 88 horse powered, 4-cyl. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> during the MX-3's production years was 'one of a kind.' Many compared it to the Toyota MR2, but I have yet to see the resemblance. Even today the '92 MX-3 looks modern, from its flush mounted, slightly 'cat eyed' headlights, to its wind cheating jelly bean shape. The MX-3 comes with a wraparound glass rear hatch. The hatch is sloped down, almost to a horizontal angle which helps aerodynamics. The MX-3 GS V6 comes with many body styling accents, which include integral fender flares; which also double as mudguards, a rear spoiler, attractive six spoke alloy wheels, fog lamps, and side marker turn signals.

   <b>Price & Reliability:</b> Brand new the '92 GS models ran from $13,000-$16,000. Today with fairly good resale, the GS models can still be bought at a fairly high price, with the exception of a good deal, most of these cars will run over $5,000. Reliability has been good with my friends car, she takes very good care of it, and besides when I drive it, the engine never gets driven to red-line. With over 100,000 miles, 3 owners, this car has lasted her over 4 years with hardly any trouble whatsoever (once the clutch had to be replaced). I suggest contacting Consumer Reports just to make sure.


<i>Final notes:</i>

The 1992 Mazda MX-3 represents an awesome value on the used car market. The MX-3 is fun to drive, looks hot, and is great on gas. I have a feeling the V6 trim lines will soon be classics.
