            I bought my 87 Omni (theres no review option available for the 87) for 900 bucks in 1998, the thing now has about 120K on it and runs better than it did when I bought it.  Most of the work Ive had done (or need to do) is due to corrosion from road salt and due to its age.  Ive replaced the entire exhaust system (air pump, muffler, etc), had the front strut mounts replaced, front brakes resurfaced, rear brake lines replaced, and thats about it(!).  I also had the carburator adjusted and had a new distributor and sparkplugs/wires put on also.  Sounds like alot, but considering the motor has not had a single damn problem with it its well worth the other repairs Ive had done.  For the overall price of about 2K including all the work I put into it, its really been worth it.  I drive this thing about 30-40 miles daily, thruway and city, Ive driven from NY to PA on about 15-20 occasions, and drove round trip to Florida (2600 miles) with it as well in the past 3 years-no problem!  This car has also almost singlehandedly moved me into 3 different apartments.  With the back seat down, it has enough room to cram stuff in that is comparable to any small pickup or van.  It's also great for the drive in...put the seat down, pop the hatch and stretch out!  If you can scoop this car up for a couple hundred bucks and put some work into it, you got a great reliable little car on your hands.  Except for the strut mounts, parts have been no problem to find and have been relatively inexpensive as well.  Of course, because of all the road salt they use up here, the doors are all rusted on the bottom, and the underside of the car is very corroded as well.  I can stick my hand inside the bottom of the door, but its nothing that some bondo and fiberglass cant fix.  The molding on the trunk is long gone as well.  But I still say this car rates up there with the Honda Civic as classic compact, reliable autos.  Sure its slow and it looks like an old rusty lunch box, but under the hood it's got a heart of gold and refuses to kick the bucket.  Hands down, my favorite car in the world is my little Dodge!
