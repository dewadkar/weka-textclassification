            Last year I bought a 1985 Mercury Topaz reluctantly. I only paid $275 and I assumed it was on its last legs. Was I wrong! The thing has run forever. The only things that needed replacing were the battery, the tires, and a few fuses and a fusable link. I have driven it all the way across the country and back! I had it up to 75 mph where it was legal to do so. I did have to stop at a lot of gas stations, but oh, well. It made a grinding noise while I was on vacation, which made me think it was going to break down, but it didn't. By the way, the noise stopped. There is a musty odor I can't get rid of, I think it's a fungus or something. It hardly leaks any oil. I can't change it because the previous owner tightened the oil pan nut too much and I stripped it while trying to remove it. Cruise control still works! I'll probably drive it until I graduate from college next year. I imagine the car will still be driven by somebody when I retire.
