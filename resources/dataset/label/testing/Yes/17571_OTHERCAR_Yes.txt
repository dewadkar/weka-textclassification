            I purchased a 1998 Toyota prerunner in Aug of 1998.  The dealer had one 4 cyl. and a couple 6 cyl models.  I wanted a 6 cyl., but the salesman told me unless I was going to be towing I didnt need the 6 cyl.  I gave the 4 cyl. a test ride.... I looked down once while on an on-ramp and I was doing 80 mph.  That let me know the 4 cyl. would do, and that the 6 cyl. might get me in trouble.  The PreRunner is basically a Tacoma 4x4 extended cab without the 4 wheel drive.  The suspension and everything is set up just like on the 4 wheel drive.  This set up has saved me several times down here in Louisiana.  I have been able to get home when friends in regular Tacomas have had to find alternate routes due to high water on roads.  I could tell you a number of stories about how the high suspension has saved me ( or at least saved me time ).  Its not SO high a lady around 5'4&quot; has any trouble getting in ( while wearing a skirt ).  The truck is over a year old, has 30,000 miles on it and has not given me any trouble.  The ride is a little rougher than the basic suspension and tires, BUT it isnt uncomfortable, quite the opposite.  Ergonomics inside and dash layout are good and comfortable.  The only complaint is that at hi highway speeds ( 80+ ) you dont have alot of passing power.  I have owned a Dakota, Jeep Cherokee and Nissan pickup, I like the PreRunner best and would suggest it to friends and family.  It looks good to boot ! Gas mileage is not that great, a little over 20 mpg average.  No real complaints... go get one !<br><br>
