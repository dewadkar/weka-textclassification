            Hi,

I have owned a 328Ci for about 6 months.  I was lucky and snagged a topaz blue one with gray leather.  My God, I was a nervous wreck when I drove it off the lot.  It was AWESOME.  It IS awesome. I absolutely love this car.  I have never felt like I was so 'at one' with a car.  Over several months' time, it has become more in-tune with my driving style.  Driving it is like dancing down the freeway with the perfect partner.  

First of all, it's so beautiful to look at.  If you buy one, get used to people staring at you... well, at least sometimes.  Get the Harmon Kardon stereo... it is INCREDIBLE!  If you like music, you'll want this stereo; anything less would be disappointing.  It is sooooo wonderful.  My favorite CDs, Everything But the Girl's &quot;Temperamental&quot; and &quot;Walking Wounded.&quot;  Get them before you drive away on your first day together; you will love the sound and the drive even more.  

The interior is GORGEOUS.  Wood, leather, the power seats. I also got the Xenon lights.  They are sooooo nice at night.  I know people complain about them, but I think it's just because they're different.  I can see so much more at night.  

The auto trans is sooooo smoooooooth.  The only thing I don't like about the car is that sometimes the interior air temp control seems to put out more heat than I'd like for the apparent ambient temp in the car.  Also, the computer has the clock in it.  But to see the clock you have to click through all the other readings.  I'm a time-conscious person, and I like a clock that's always visible.  But if you can handle those things, you will not regret buying this car.  I also got the upgraded BMW alarm.  

The auto-adjusting rear-view mirror and windshield wipers are great.  This car will spoil you.  I will get another BMW for sure if this one performs like it does now throughout the next 2-3 years.  An awesome car!  BUY IT!  NOW!!!!!! :)<br><br>
