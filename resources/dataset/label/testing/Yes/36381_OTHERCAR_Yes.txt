            So... I need to buy a car. My 92 thunderbird is not exactly pushing the horsies like it used to, and besides I need two cars. One to go to the shop and one to drive. I am young, male and like to drive a quick, good handling car. So I look at Preludes, Corrados, basically two door sports cars and decide that car insurance is conspiracy to keep young males driving seventies station wagons.  Let's face it, I want to make the car fast, and pay the insurance as if it were slow. I wanted a car that I could modify heavily. I am telling you people, I wanted a Honda. So I bought a 94 Accord EX (Freaky climax music here). Itï¿½s a cool car. I dig it- the V-Tec engine is punchy and the car handles smoothly, and there is a nearly unlimited amount of upgrades on the market for Hondas. In retrospect though, I would say buy a civic or a prelude if your looking to do a lot of turbo-charging or supercharging those models seem to have a lot more available after market parts. So all right! I've got a cool import car just screaming for modification. Then... The starter goes out and my goodness I got soaked, bleached, wrung out, hung up to dry, and then beaten to get the dust out. If something goes wrong with one of these buggers plan on payin'. Hopefully nothing else goes to wrong. The car has 60,000 miles on it and is in great condition, but a tune up costs near 180-250 dollars and that needs to be done soon. Basically, I love the car but am totally disappointed at the cost of repairs. I don't want to feel like a village maiden after a Viking invasion every time I have to go to the mechanic.
