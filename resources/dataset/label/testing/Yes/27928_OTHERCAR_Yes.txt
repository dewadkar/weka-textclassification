            Bought this car in Jan. '98, 35,000 miles ago.

At the time, the rationale was that it was a) on par with the BMW 540 or Mercedes E420 series and b) about $6k to $10k cheaper. Also liked the fact that it was a new design and not as familiar in my neighborhood. 300 HP V-8, 0-60 in 5.9 seconds, and good handling/stopping with the big tires. I think they sort of underpriced it on introduction.

For me, it's a commuter car. It's quiet, steady, reliable, and responds immediately. I used to have a BMW M5 and this is a lot more usable, and probably just as fast everywhere except at a track. It has good road feel due to the standard wide tires.

The GS 400 has been a better car than I expected. Everything works the way it is supposed to - which is rare enough - and the performance is surprisingly good. At first I wasn't too keen on the way it looks, but it has grown on me - and the low-key looks help avoid tickets.

If there is a negative, it is probably Lexus service. They are professionally over-attentive. After a routine maintenance, I get about three pieces of mail asking me to fill out surveys about how they did. Hey, you changed the oil fine, leave me alone.<br><br>
