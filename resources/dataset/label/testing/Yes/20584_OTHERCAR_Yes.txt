            Let me first start out by saying that I have a 2000 Audi A4 sedan 1.8t with basically no options.  I know these review categories don't distinguish between different models of the same car, so it's important we're on the same wavelength here.

I had always loved the look of the Audi A4.  It was one of those cars that I always watched as it passed my by in my old and dilapidated Accord.  I would catch myself dreaming of having one.  To my surprise, when I started looking around for a new car, I found that I could afford this car I had lusted after for quite some time.  I took it for a few test drives and decided that this was the car for me.

Let me be clear, when I first started looking for a car I was not a very knowledgeable person as far as the performance aspects of a car.  I am still not that person, but I have grown much more discriminating in that aspect as time has passed and I've driven the A4 around for over a year now.

So, I bought the A4.  I was comparing it with the Accord and Passat.  You can see why I left with the A4 huh?  Although the other two cars are great cars, they don't exactly have the sexiness of an A4.  Plus the Passat's warranty was pure crap at the time (2 years?) while the A4 boasted a 4 yr/50,000 mile warranty.  My main criteria was to have a quality car that would last for a long time and be reliable.  I felt the A4 had all that and a little style thrown in.

Now you know why I bought the car, let me tell you what I think after having it for a year now.

Interior:

I love the interior of this car.  I have the "leatherette" option.  I absolutely hate cloth but didn't have enough money for a leather interior, so I ended up with leatherette.  I think it's a great compromise.  It doesn't have the feel of real leather, but it looks like it from the outside and ages much better (no creases or drying...).  As far as the layout of the interior goes, it's all well thought out.  The cd/radio/temperature console that runs down the middle has large but not clunky buttons.  The driver's instrument display is equally clean and intuitive.  At night the console lights up with a dim red glow, producing a very cool effect (hey, these things add up).

I'm not a tall man (5'-7") and this car fits me great.  However, there's not much leg room in the back of the car, even with some short people up front.  This car is definitely not for somebody who wants to go on long road trips with friends or family.

The seats are great.  I usually get pretty discomforted when I sit in any seat for an extended amount of time.  The first time I drove this car beyond just test drives was a 14 hour trip from FL to NC.  The whole time I remember being amazed that my back felt normal and wasn't aching.  A big plus for those who spend a lot of time driving.

The trunk doesn't look like it's that big from the outside, but it's surprisingly large.  I wouldn't suggest moving your furniture in it, but taking the fam to the airport shouldn't be a problem.  It also has a nice feature in that the back seats fold down (in 2 sections in case you only need 1/2 down) so you can fit that occasional large purchase from the trunk through the back.  I didn't think I would ever use that, but it has come in handy several times.

Exterior:

It should be pretty clear at this point that I really like how the A4 looks.  It definitely has a sporty yet non-excessive body design. I have the Santorin Blue model and it really shines after a good wash, making the car look like a luxury car.

Since I got the 1.8t without any options, there is a little too much wheel gap between my 15" wheels and the wheel well.  It is definitely something that's urked me for awhile now.  It almost looks like a baby carriage (if you're the very discriminating type).  In addition, the wheels that come with it are pretty nasty.  They're the 8 spoke factory wheels.  Something about them just doesn't look good on the car.  The 16" sport wheels that come with the sport package are definitely the way to go.

Performance:

Coming from an 85' Accord, this car felt like I was sitting on top of a jet engine at first.  However, as I get used to it and have driven newer cars I've found fault with some of the performance of this car.

First of all, the 150hp turbo engine is decent, but it definitely doesn't press you against your seat (it's also a bit loud).  I have been eyeing the chip to increase hp, but that could negate the warranty and costs about $500.  However, you do get about 200hp from that mod, not a bad improvement at all.

Also, I have really noticed the amount of body roll with the normal suspension package.  Every turn I take almost feels like I'm standing on my side.  And whenever I get off to a fast start or go to shift quickly, the hood pumps up and down. A stiffer suspension would be in order here, which the sports package provides.  I would definitely go for that package or be prepared to put those modes in yourself.

The drive is very smooth and solid.  I can definitely tell a difference in engineering between the A4 and some other smaller cars.  The A4 just feels very solid and smooth. 

Service:

I have not had many problems at all with this car.  I had a power surge or something that burnt out both my headlights at the same time, but that's it.

Everytime I've gone in to get my normal 5,000 mile checkup/oil change (very conveniant by the way) I've been very pleased.  The service staff is always very courteous and prompt.  I don't know if it's just indicitave of this particular service station (Leith Audi/Cary NC), but I get the feel that all certified Audi shops place a big emphasis on quality of service.

Summary:

So in summary, this car has a lot of great features and is a well built, well engineered car.  However, the model I got lacks in the performance department.  I would definitely consider opting for the sports package and larger engine.  And if you need that extra bit of performance, sounds like you need an S4.
