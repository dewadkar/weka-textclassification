            We bought the Olympus 340R after weeks of looking at various digital cameras. We use it mainly for personal photos and it has worked out great for us. It is one of the less expensive digital cameras on the market, but we have not noticed a lack of quality in the images, nor have we been dissatisfied with the ease of use. The camera can be managed as a point and shoot type or as a more traditional camera (f-stop manipulation, etc). There is a built in flash and the kit comes with the memory card, which, at medium resolution holds up to 122 pictures. It is a real pleasure to take pictures and upload them to the computer with a minimum of hassle. Our only real complaint is that it does not come with an AC adapter--however, the batteries last so long that it has not been a problem. We've had the camera over six months now and have only had to change the batteries once despite heavy usage.<br><br>
