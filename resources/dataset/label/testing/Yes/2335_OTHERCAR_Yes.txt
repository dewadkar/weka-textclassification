            I've been using my Toshiba PDR-M4 for about a year now, and I have ~500MB of pictures (the ones I've kept!)  This camera delivers on all its promises, and if you couple it with a good photo printer (I have an Epson 870), you will not need use your  film camera very much.  In spite of the fact that &quot;experts&quot; say you need 3 Megapixels or more to print 8x10 size photos, I have lots of prints of that size on my walls everyone raves about.

Key pluses of this camera (besides the pics are great): very fast boot..as fast as any film camera, which is important if you have kids.  Small size means you will actually take it with you.  The USB port is vastly faster than the serial port (although having both is handy.  Menus/interface easy to use &amp; understand, I have to pry it out of my kids' hands.  Rechargeable Lithium ion battery is included in the package

Negatives: flash is somewhat weak (which i think is common to many digital cameras).  I am always able to overcome the weak flash with &quot;quick fix&quot; options on the software.  Other negative is no optical zoom, which i realized when i bought it (to keep the price down) Other than that, nothing to complain about.

Since this camera has been superceded by newer models, i have seen the price in the $250-300 range..this camera will clobber other cameras in that range <br><br>
