            OK, I'll admit it. I'm a Toyota fan! I've owned both the 1992-1996, and the 1997-2001 body style Camry. When Toyota introduced its newest Camry in 2002, I was thoroughly impressed with its sleek lines and curves. I couldn't wait to buy one, but I had to financially! Now my ship has come in and I finally got to purchase one. Here are my first impressions:

Exterior: Sleek sporty design that is very appealing. One thing that's sort of odd about this design is that it will look sportier depending on the color you chose. My white looks far sportier than my father-in-laws green Camry.

Clear glass head lights are very attractive. Trunk is nice and roomy, also well illuminated. 

Attractive wheel covers for those who don't choose alloy wheels.

Interior: This is where Toyota has improved greatly. The dash board illuminates in a soft blue/gray color that is easy on the eyes. 

 The climate control/defrost knobs are easily accessible and very simple to operate! In fact, they should have thought of this design 30 years ago! A/C is so cold it will run you out of the car!

 Radio LCD is large and easy to read. Simple radio control buttons. Great sounding stereo.

If I could recommend one thing to Toyota, it would be to synchronize the colors of their dash, radio, and clock LCDs. As mentioned earlier, the dash is a soft blue, the radio is a forest green, and the clock is a lighter shade of green.

 Passenger side airbag door is small and less conspicuous,

 Steering wheel tilt adjusts under the steering column, which is a bit awkward. It also does not tilt to a complete vertical position. 

 The seats are very comfortable, lots of head room and legroom. (I'm 6'4"). The only awkward thing is that the rear blindspots can be tricky to adjust to.  

Console is very attractive and provides the driver easy access to lots of little storage places.

Performance: The 158 Horse power 4 cylinder is flat out awesome. Most people would not be able to tell you if you are driving a 4 cylinder or 6 cylinder with the impressive pickup. I was thoroughly impressed with the acceleration and then the salesperson pointed out that we were driving in overdrive!! When I took the car out of overdrive . . . . WOW! 

The ride is silky smooth like all the Camrys of the past have produced. If you are considering a Honda Accord, you really need to do a double take on this Camry! It is my observation that Toyota has tried to refine the ride to accommodate those who want to take the curves (very handily), ala the Honda Accord, as well as those who are happy to set the cruise on 55 for a comfortable Sunday drive. The vehicle provides a happy balance for both crowds!

The transmission shifts quietly and effortlessly. Over the years, Toyota has pretty much mastered the drivetrains on their vehicles.

32 MPG on the highway provides even the greatest of fuel misers with less frequent gas station trips.

The brakes take some getting used to as you tend to have to push them further down than most vehicles. However, I have had a couple of occasions in which I had to brake immediately and the brakes responded safely and immediately.

All in all I am impressed with yet another fine piece of Toyota workmanship! It is without a doubt, dollar for dollar the best deal on the road!! Go drive one today!!!
