            For several years now, that's how Subaru has touted it's cars.  &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; is what I always thought.  But after trying out a Legacy GT Wagon this week, maybe Subaru hasn't missed the mark by that much. 

<b>Trim Levels</b>
The Legacy Wagon (no separate category here for the model I drove) is available in several trim levels: base <b>Brighton</b>, step-up <b>L</b>, sporty <b>GT</b>, and popular <b>Outback and Outback Limited</b> editions. The GT model I drove is priced very closely to the Outback, and according to the dealer, is the rarest of Legacy wagons because of this price similarity.  Seems more people go for the Outback's rugged appeal than the sportiness the GT offers.

<b>My Test Car</b>
I tested a 2000 GT wagon in White Birch with Gray Moquette interior.  Leather is not an option on the GT wagon, perhaps another reason why more buyers opt for the Outback.  The car I tested came fully equipped with all power options, dual moonroofs, CD and cassette players, automatic transmission, and, of course, Subaru's all wheel drive system, which is now standard on <b>all</b> their cars.

<b>Exterior Looks</b>
The recently restyled Legacy takes on more of a European feel than its predecessors. While the styling is still a bit vanilla, it is more remarkable than the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry's cookie-cutter appearances.  My white tester featured monochrome paint,  multi-spoke wheels with low-profile tires, and a roof rack.  For a wagon, the paint and wheel combination, along with lower body cladding gave it a look that was anything but soccer mom. 

<b>Interior Looks, Comfort, and Convenience</b>

The interior of the Legacy gets high marks from me.  The plush upholstery was stylish, comfortable, and appeared as if it would hold up well to years of use. The backseat was probably the most comfortable I have ever sat in--with ample leg, head, and shoulder room, plus lumbar support that put the front seats of most cars to shame.  The backseat also featured three adjustable headrests and three shoulder harnesses--a safety plus for those left &quot;riding the hump.&quot;  The front seats were very comfortable as well, earning accolades for terrific lower back support and a newly-available driver's power feature.  

The dashboard was extremely well-designed.  The plastics and faux-wood accents were pleasing to the eye, and the controls had a luxury appearance.  Everything was an easy reach for the driver, and most of the controls were easy enough to find with both eyes on the road.  As with most cars, some of the radio buttons were small and would take some getting used to. 

The dual sunroofs are operated by ONE switch.  The forward sunroof tilts up, and the rear one slides back. This was one of the most impressive features to me because there are very few cars that I will consider without a sunroof, and for a car to have <b>TWO</b> gets it kudos from me.  The trunk floor lifts up to reveal a shallow cargo tray for holding tools, detailing items, or whatever else the owner might see fit to stow there.  Small touches, such as tethers in the car's rear ceiling to allow a child safety seat, abounded--proving to me that Subaru had thought out every detail.

<b>Driving the Legacy</b>
WOW!  I didn't expect much from a wagon--be it one badged as <b>GT</b> or not.  But the four-cylinder boxer engine delivered 165 horsepower, giving this wagon every bit as much from-a-stop power as my Honda Prelude.  Smooth and quiet, the 2000 Subaru betrays its economy-car roots by delivering almost-luxury car-like handling. 

My only complaint was a small amount of shudder I noticed on hard braking. I am not sure whether this can be attributed to the anti-lock brakes, or if the AWD is to blame, but it was hardly noticeable.

<b>Overall Impressions</b>
This car had it all--room, power, comfort, and style.  Subarus that I have had experience with in the past have been practically indestructible.  When compared with the Jeep Cherokee I tested previously (and for the same money) the Legacy wins hands down.
