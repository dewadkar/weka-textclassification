            This is a very comfortable minivan, almost car-like in handling, seating and climate control.  The engine is peppy and I get about 18mpg in mixed driving, 22-23mpg on the highway on regular unleaded gas.  Under the hood everything is well-marked and the oil filter is one of the most easily accessible I've ever encountered.  Storage options are excellent with easily movable/removable middle seats and a rear bench seat that folds into a well, making a flat surface large enough for a 4x8 sheet of plywood (with the middle seats removed).  The only weakness was the factory stereo cassette system, although aftermarket speakers and a small amplifier make a big difference.<br><br>
