            I purchased my Forest Green 1998 Dodge Durango on the Fourth of July, 2000 and have been happy with my purchase.  It had 37,000 miles on it but looked brand new.  I have heard many problems with the Durango, but decided to go in for it anyway considering I knew I was going to be purchasing a warranty plan.

Well, 3 months later I have not had to use that warranty plan.  The car drives great, no jitters or hard starts.  Runs like a dream.  Although I do wish it was a tad better on gas, you get what you ask for when buying an SUV.

The Durango I purchased has leather seating, the SLT group package, the 8 speaker Infinity sound system, overhead console computer, oversized off-road tires, 3rd row seats.  My Infinity speaker system doesn't exactly sound as good as it did when I first bought it.  I am suspecting a blown rear speaker, but since audio accessories are not under warranty I am going to wait it out a bit.  The oversized tires squeal a lot when taking corners slow, but other than that they handle and ride excellent.

The seating is excellent, I have been able to fit myself and 7 other friends in this Durango for extended periods of time without too much complaining.  On the highway the Durango rides like a dream, very smooth... but noise on the highway can get excessive.  I recommend having the radio on.

I have enjoyed my 1998 Durango, and it now has 46,000 miles on it since I have been driving it so much!  I would honestly recommend that someone buys a used over new.  New Durangos cost roughly around $30,000.  You can get a nice used one for around $22,000... a much better deal.<br><br>
