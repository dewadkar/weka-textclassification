               I have high praise for this car.  It currently has 140,000 miles on the odometer, but is suffering little from age.  It runs very smoothly, the suspension is soft enough to eat up most of the pot holes.  There is plenty of room for five, but can accommodate six if needed, which is a definite plus.  The 3.0L engine has adequate power, and is never sluggish. Shifting is smooth and problem free. It does very well on gas as well, 25 mpg or so.  The brakes stop the car in a relatively short distance, too. So if you want a good reliable car that will never let you down, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg, the Sable is one car definitely worth considering.
