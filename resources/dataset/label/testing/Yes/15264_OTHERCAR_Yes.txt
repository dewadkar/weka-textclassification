            I purchased this camera approx. 1 1/2 years ago.  I have used this in my 
Ebay business.  This one was the top of the line when I bought it and I also wanted the movie mode. I have 2 small children and I thought &quot;How cool I can get shots to put on my computer and send to Aunts and Uncles.  I wish they had a larger capacity battery that came with it without having to order extra.  At the time I bought it, I ordered the extra battery and I am so glad I did because for what I do the other one just is not long enough life.  The main reason I really like this one is I can put it on 3.5 disk.  I would not buy one that did not have it, even though I had to pay a chunk more for it.  Would be nice if the price had not been so high but I'll make that back in my sales from the great pictures I can take and upload on Ebay.  Another plus was I did not have to load up any other program on my computer.<br><br>
