            After a long month of researching various vehicles in the 16K and under area, I came to the conclusion that the Ford Focus was probably the best deal on the market.  In searching for a sedan that was affordable, stylish, relatively loaded, and dependable, the Focus ZTS was my first pick. But I did look at other vehicles too....

The 2000 Civic EX Coupe: while the V-tech engine was fun to rev, the interior was extra bland and cheap looking (although I do trust Honda for its workmanship).  While I would not dispute that the civic is excellent in the resale and reliability dept., for 2k more than the focus, Honda could have offered a better package. Suspension was OK.  Steering was loose.  The rear was felt like it would swish around on every turn.  Moonroof option a plus though!

The 2000 Nissan Sentra GXE: A fine car.  It was a few degrees better than the Civic, but was still distinctly Japanese.  (Conservative styling down to a science)  Engine was smoothe and adequately powered.  Suspension was better than Civic, but not as smoothe as the Focus.  Steering was fairly responsive, not too loose.  The Sentra, while much better looking than the 1999 version, still left much to be desired in the back seat.  (ie. don't even think about taking anyone in the back for more than an hour..no leg room)

The 2000 VW Golf GLS 2.0: NICE Car, BAD Price 18.5K msrp.  This cute hatchback was really impressive when I first sat in.  The german engineering and styling was immediately apparent, from the solidly constructed doors and seats to the buttons that say 'if you paid more for me I could have done this for you.' While the Golf is a great little car, it was pretty underpowered (note: the golf is 400lbs heavier than the focus).  You feel like you are going faster than you are.  The german engine (2.0 115HP, 122 torque) was pleasingly throaty though.  With 8 speakers, the base stereo was the best of all the cars I saw near this price range.  Besides the engine, the cupholders were a major pain in the a&amp;se: they are located above stereo and HVAC controls, meaning that condensation or a spilled drink would be all over your console and perhaps even your gearshift. OH, and another very disturbing thing about the engine.  On a test drive with the Golf, we happened to sputter out two blocks away from the dealership.  it was totally out of gas.  No problem right?  Just get more gas and go.  Well, after filling up the tank, the car refused to start.  What was happening was that the engine computer would not let the car start WITHOUT a JUMP. SIGH!!!  Do all cars do that now?  I hope not.

OK, so the Protege wasn't high on my list, but only because it seemed like a slightly better sentra, which actually makes it a pretty good car.  But alas, the focus zts had caught my eye.....

So, I've just bought the focus, and I'm still getting used to it, but I am falling in love with it more and more every day.  Its interior styling is pretty much without flaw.  The only point of contention would be the fact that the passenger seat isn't 6 way adjustable.  The seats are comfy and more chair-like than most other small cars. Door pockets are HUGE.  The CD-AM/FM stereo is very nice.  Its got great sound and an automatic volume control that ups the volume as your car speeds up!  Really cool!  And a detachable face on a stock stereo? WOW!  After driving a car with small stereo and HVAC controls, the focus was a needed change.  The dials are rubberized and placed below the stereo, a big plus on the road.  The AC on American cars, for one reason or another, is really really good.  Japanese cars' AC's don't even get cool enough fast enough to compare.  In Southern California, we all know that AC is a necessity.  OK, now the best part of the interior is definitely the dimensions.  Its huge.  In the front, you never feel like you are in a small car.  In the back, there's plenty of leg room (4 more inches than any other compact car).  its true that there are no rear headrests, but as a driver, I'd probably remove them if they were there, for rear visibility reasons.  The trunk is pretty decent, and with folding seats, the load floor is flat.  So now on to the engine and handling.....

The focus drives like a mid-size car.  The fully independent suspension feels more Beemeresque than anything else.  Railroad tracks? where?  :)  Behind the wheel, you'll appreciate that the steering is precise and with just the right feedback. Props to the guys at Ford for this one.  With 130 horses and 135 torque, the zetec engine does not disappoint, as long as you remember that you are not driving a 328i.  But, when you need that extra power to pass or kick it up to 100mph, you won't be denied.  For a car that's compact, its grip on the road is commendable.  The road and wind noise is actually much better than other compacts, although at speeds in excess of 80 mph, it does become noticeable.  Very little rear swaying, and at high speeds it hunkers down.  And the turning radius, while probably on par with cars of the same size, will surprise you, since its easy to feel like you are in a larger car.  The cruise controls are easy and on the wheel, which is very convenient.  Brakes are quite responsive, with discs in front and drums in rear.  Haven't gotten a chance to test out the ABS, but I'm glad to have them standard.  With an automatic, I've heard that the power is slightly diminished, but from what I can tell, you won't be disappointed.  Headlamps are pretty good.  Oh, and leather-wrapped steering wheel with tilt/telescopic feature makes driving that much more enjoyable.  Finally, there's the issue of the height of the car as you drive.  Imagine you are driving a mini-minivan....  your head floats a head above Japanese compacts and just below that of SUV's.  Pretty nice in my opinion.  

Well, I hope people who read this come away more confident in Ford's newest econo-box, but let me reassure you that it is very much not your typical compact.  MUCH better!  Hey, there's a reason why it has won all of those awards in Europe and America. I'm sure more are on their way.  On a scale from 1-10, I would give the focus a solid 9.  Go test drive it today!!!

PS: the exterior is 'new edge,' which translates on the focus sedan as being more beemeresque. Oh, and the air bags are depowered, so they won't kill you after you've been run off the road.  :) 



Update: Recently, I drove across the country with my Ford Focus ZTS, from Los Angeles to Chicago.  This was a full 2200 miles.  With the trunk and half the back seat filled to the brim with stuff, and two other people in the car, we trekked through Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and finally to Illinois.  The car, a bit lowered at this point, made it quite smoothely through the desert.  A times, I had to rev the engine up to 4500 rpm to make it up the steep inclines (going at 70mph though).  In all honesty, the engine performed better when the AC was off, but that was only necessary when I was climbing up the Rockies through the Vail Pass.  With temperatures soaring past 110 F in the desert and humidity in the midwest reaching 90% at times, the interior remained cool and dry thanks to the excellent AC.  There were literally no problems with the engine.  No overheating or anything.  The seating comfort of this car was proven on this trip, as no one complained about back aches or leg cramps.  (Of course, it does help to stop every couple hundred miles to stretch)  The only loss incurred with the car was a 4&quot; plastic rim cover in the center of the front left wheel.  Its probably lost somewhere on a llama farm in Kansas. Overall, the car is still in very good condition.  Its like I never drove across the country or anything.  AND, I'm still due for my first oil change.  OK, now here is the one and only significant complaint so far: Sometimes when I come to a stop and am waiting at a light, there is a significant vibration from the engine that comes up through the steering column.  I think I'm going to take it to the dealer to have it inspected.  This has had no impact on the engine's performance though, rest assured.   Other than that, this car continues to get compliments from everyone who sits in it. 'I never thought Ford could make a car like this' is a popular one.  :)<br><br>
