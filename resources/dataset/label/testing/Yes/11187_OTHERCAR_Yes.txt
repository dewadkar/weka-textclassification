            The DX3700 was my first purchase in the digital camera field.  I was drawn to the fact it had a high 3.1-megapixel resolution at an affordable price.  

I had compared it to the DX3900 (which has an optical zoom lens), but the DX3900 was noticeably more expensive, so I stuck to the DX3700.

I was immediately impressed by the image quality.  Prints are outstanding when printed on photo paper, with good sharpness and color accuracy.  Even so, I've since tried other 3.0-megapixel cameras and I think the Kodak's overall quality is a bit inferior.  That may be due to Kodak's Ektanar lens, or the CCD imager in the DX3700 isn't quite a full 3.1-megapixel sensor.

Operation is simple.  You really just point and shoot.  Pressing the shutter button halfway sets the autofocus, pressing it fully snaps the picture.  How easy is that?  NOTE:  The DX3700 uses Secure Digital (SD) or Multi-Media Card (MMC) memory.  These are expensive!  The camera does NOT come with one, either, but does have 8MB internal storage (good for about 8 pictures at highest quality).  I bought a 64MB SD card and it's amazing how many pictures it can hold (about 65 to 70 images!).

I only have two real complaints with the camera.  First is the lack of an optical zoom.  This means a fixed lens.  You can't zoom in on the action from any distance.  The DX3700 has a difficult time focusing on anything too distant, also.  A zoom lens would help.  Digital zoom, quite frankly, is poor quality.  Ignore it.

My second complaint is that this camera eats battery power like mad.  The special CRV3 batteries provide the longest life, but they're also expensive (about $8.50 or more...EACH).  Lithium-Ion "AA" batteries are adequate, but don't last nearly as long as the CRV3.  NiMH rechargeable batteries are the best bet, but Kodak's special ones (the only battery the optional Camera Dock will charge) don't always charge the way they're supposed to.

Yes, it has some flaws.  Flaws that enthusiast or serious photographers will be seriously displeased with.  But casual photographers will love this camera's simplicity and low price.  It's a great camera for the money, and compares well to most any other point and shoot camera.
