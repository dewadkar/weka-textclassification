            I bought this vehicle to haul 5 kids around. I love the cosmetics of the vehicle as well as the features. I hate the small problems that seem to multiply with this vehicle. I only have 29,000 miles on this vehicle and already I have had to replace the headlights due to moisture leakage, repair a faulty radiator, the clock led does not work properly, the temperature readout does not function properly, the blinker is on the blink, the load leveling works but only if I leave the fuse in place long enough to burn up the air pump which it feeds from. I have already had that (the pump) replaced once.  The tire blew out and the tread literally came off of the rim, so I had to replace all four of them even though the tread still had plenty of life. I know this is crazy, but I still like my vehicle because it does drive nice and the Pontiac Dealer has repaired everything under warranty with exception to the tires. I think maybe I have just received the Car with all of the prototypes in it. <br><br>
