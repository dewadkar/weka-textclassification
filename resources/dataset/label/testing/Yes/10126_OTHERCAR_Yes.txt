            When my mom bought me my protege it had 62,000 miles on it, its bright red w/ no oxidization. It runs fine, I've had no trouble with it except that when i had the cv joint replaced they disturbed seals so now it slowly leaks tranny fluid. Its very roomy inside, gets great gas miledge, its easy on the eyes, handles wells, it has &quot;pep&quot;, the hold button is great on hills, the seats are pretty comfortable, the trunk is huge and gets even bigger when you fold down the back seats, its great on the freeway, it doesnt have any blind spots that i know of, and thats all the good stuff i can think of right now.
   Now for the things i dont like, <b>IT IDLES LOUD!!</b> when you are sitting at a stop light, the car rattles. I dont like having to hold the handles up when i lock it. I blew the speakers like the first week i had it. i had trouble figuring out how to open the gas cap, but i figured that one out. ands thats it.
love
