            There's only 2 knocks against this car in my mind -- its a target for thieves, and its expensive for its class. Given how many of these cars are on the road, and how popular these are in the resale market, the theft is not a fault of Honda. The LX model in Canada comes with an immobiliser build in, and an option for an additional security system.

As for the price, I think this is simply a result of supply and demand. Honda's latest Civic incarnation is its best yet, with a superb VTEC engine and great standard features. Previous generations have a strong reputation for quality, and 6 months in I've had no problems.

The only other caveat I have is that the cabin noise is a bit higher than I'm used to; it is better than my 1994 VW Golf CL, but i would consider only average for recent models of comparable sedans.

I seriously considered the new Corolla, but chose the Civic mainly due to personal preference. The Civic has a wider body and handles better, in my opinion. The Civic's new blue-lighted dashboard looks very sporty. The flat floor in the rear seating area is very impressive for a sedan. Finally, I prefer the styling of the Civic. Placed beside a recent 300 or 500 series BMW its hard to tell them apart at first glance.

Highly recommended, but don't expect much leverage on the price. Rumours are that the 2003 has a tighter suspension than the 2002 model, which i felt when test driving both model years.
