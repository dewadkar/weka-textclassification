            I love my mini-van!  I never thought I would have ever said this -- in fact, I used to think that I would never drive a mini-van.  Oh well, that was pc (pre children).

My van is a 1996 Olds Silhouette with almost 100,000 miles.  I expect I will drive it for another 100,000.  It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  This thing is fully loaded with a leather interior -- simply beautiful to look at and comfortable for long road trips.  

A 3.4 liter engine is standard equipment  on this van, as it its four speed automatic transmission.  It has enough power to make is a charm to drive, which I consider a big plus.  Other standard equipment included on the van are anti-lock brakes, driver-side air bag, halogen headlamps and fog lamps, and seven passenger seating.  The standard aluminum wheels give the van a sporty feel.

Some of the things I love about my van include the power sliding side door.  With small children this has been a god send, especially when the children were babies -- a simple press of the dohickie on the remote lock and the door opens.  The newer vans have lighter doors, but this one is extremely heavy -- and almost impossible for a child to open. Again, the automatic door to the rescue.  I donï¿½t think I would buy another van without this feature.

Another thing I love about this van is that the seats in the second and third row can be removed and are interchangeable.  One of the seats in the van has an integrated child seat (another must have when you have youngsters), but quite frankly, the seat is uncomfortable when the child seat is folded closed.  Now that we no longer need that seat, it was a snap with interchangeable seats to put it in the least used position.

As I said before, I love my mini van.  When it comes time to buy another one, I will definitely look toward Silhouette.<br><br>
