            I should preface by saying I am not a Ford fan.  I never thought I would buy another car with the blue oval affixed to it again.  But in looking for a cheap, economical commuter car to fit my new job I decided to keep an open mind.  The glowing reviews which abound toward this little car finally convinced me to give it a try.  Had to wait over a month for a 5 speed ZX3 to arrive at the dealer so I could take it for a test.  And in that month I did my homework on this and other options.  The facts weighed heavily in favor of this car.  Standard options that are either not available or a costly option on similar autos, a price that is amazing for what you get, a great deal of actual thought put into the car.  My tester finally arrived and I went for my first moving experience in a Focus.  Amazing!  The Zetec motor and 5 speed combine for a snappy driving feel with more than adequate umph to pass on the highway. The handling is very good, with perhaps a bit more body roll than I would like but Im used to driving race prepped cars which dont move at all so my opinion is skewed. Solid feel, low noise levels, and the seats!  Due to an auto accident a few years ago I am very particular to comforable seating positions and seats themselves.  I have gone through alot of &quot;high end&quot; autos trying to find something I could drive for more than half an hour without back pain.  The Focus is amazing I could drive all day and remain comfortable.  The price on my car, equipped with A/C and remote locks was still well below 14,000, a great deal for the money.  <br><br>
