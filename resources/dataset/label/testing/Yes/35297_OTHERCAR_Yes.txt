            I bought this vehicle for its safety features and dependability. The Corsica is also surprisingly roomy for both front and rear passangers. The handling is excellent and it is well made. Not only is the Corsica roomy, safe, sprorty and dependable, it has alot of speed packed into the V-6 engine. I couldnt believe how much acceleration they packed into this seemingly slow car. You may not believe it, but ive been able to outrace BMW's in my tiny Corsica. The only thing i dont really like about the Corsica is the way it looks. You have to admit, its not the prettiest car. However, Chevy makes, by far, the best cars in america with Ford in second.<br><br>
