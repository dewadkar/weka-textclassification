            Well for surly this isn�t a family car - there�s no room. Nor a exceptional winter car. But this is one hell of a spring, summer, and fall car.  Some aspects of this amazing vehicle start with its power steering, on this  stiff frame you feel the road. Rear passengers have commented that it feels a bit like a roller-coaster back there, and when the top is down, they feel like they might be sucked out the back. The rear seat is surprisingly high and a tall person easily looks over the windshield. I make sure everyone is buckled up back there!

But on a warm summer day, with the top down, the stereo blasting and the road winding out in front, nothing would make me give up this car. It is utterly cool, a pleasure to drive and looks way better than everything else out there. The Mustang convertible is the perfect mid-sized sports car for the single or no-kid couple, who can keep a second car for the winter.

Styling - it's an envy machine wherever I go! Parents with kids and minivans stare longingly. It contains a Powerful - V6, manual transmission makes for great muscle and a solid feel of power no matter the gear. It's not a zippy as a VTEC engine, but hey, it's a Mustang. 

Convertible - I will NEVER have another type of car for summer driving. The power roof lowers and raises quickly. Get the optional glass rear-window with defrost. As for its Size it's big, but not bulky. I feel safe, but snug and everything is within the driver. The Sound system - I got the optional high-end system and it was worth it. It's not a very noisy car, surprisingly, even with the top down. But the stereo delivers high quality sound no matter your speed or roof situation.

Overall assessment buy this car, it worth the money.
