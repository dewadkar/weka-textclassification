            My foremost reason for purchasing the Sony MVC-FD73 was to facilitate online selling. At first, I was a bit leery of the fact that this camera has an automatic focus ONLY. As an old-time photographer, I enjoy the control that manual manipulation of a camera can give. However, I quickly became convinced of the wisdom of the automatic focus, since the camera seems to be able to &quot;see&quot; a lot better than I do, and has saved me from having to go back and re-shoot. This feature really does work like a charm.

Plus, the Sony MVC-FD73 can close-in on a subject to an impressive degree. I've been able to photograph things so tightly that you can see the fibers in paper items.

While the Sony MVC-FD73 isn't Sony's top-of-the-line model, it certainly has enough features and durability to make it perfect for both business and home use.<br><br>
