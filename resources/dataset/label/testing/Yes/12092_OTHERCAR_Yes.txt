            We leased our silver ( a great color choice) grand vitara last january at local cleveland dealer. we looked at the toyota, the honda, and kia models before making our selection. this is why we chose the grand vitara:
1. it is the only vehicle in its class to offer 4 wheel drive on demand instead of all wheel all the time ( which consumes more gas )
2. it is the only standard 6 cylinder in its class ( more pull away power esp. on inclines )
3. much more cabin room - both headroom and legroom ( my husband is 6'-3&quot;, and feels quite comfortable )
4. the overall appearance feels similar to a &quot;baby lexus&quot; and will most definitely command attention as ours did 
5. standard equip. includes cruise, tilt, airbags, rear wiper, cassette, alarm and air, so there is little need to shop models other than color
6. the rear hatch opens quite easily toward the curb for safe loading &amp; unloading.

all of this and the fact that it is priced very closely to its rivals made this a no- brainer for us and will for you too!
