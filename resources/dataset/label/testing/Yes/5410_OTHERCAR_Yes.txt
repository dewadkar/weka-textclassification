            Overall this camera is a solid value. As with any product, it has it's high points and it's low points.

First, the camera's highs. This camera is small. Definately pocket size, 2.7 inches tall, 4.1 inches long and 1.5 inches deep. When the camera is in use, the lens pops out maybe an inch at most. The viewfinder is sufficient for closer shots, but for further away shots I'd definately use the 1.8 inch LCD view panel. It has a 2.3X zoom, which averages out to a 70mm lens for a standard 35mm camera. Not a lot, but for everyday use it's definately good. The camera also came with a great software package, with ULead PhotoImpact 4.2 being my software app of choice. Easy to use and set up, it's a winner as well.

Now, for the lows. The 2 second wait before image is taken is a real pain. It uses that time to set proper focus and to determine whether a flash is needed. I took this camera to a Pacers basketball game. The seats were in the lower third of Conseco Fieldhouse, but the images were too distant and blurry. If folks stood still I was in good shape. Add motion and forget it. I had considered this camera for race car pictures but that is DEFINATELY out. But for images on vacation, it should be acceptable.

My overall evaluation of this camera is middle of the pack. It's a great buy for the novice or everyday user. If you want fast snapshots or looking to photograph moving images, you'll have fits with it. <br><br>
