            We bought our 1997 Ford Explorer 4WD when we were expecting our daughter.  The Mustang (please see my review on this product also) was not going to be big enough for our family any longer.  We favored the Explorer, because we were pretty much hooked on Ford products.  Trading in our 1993 F-150 (the lease was expiring and we were getting a company truck) made it a lot easier to work a deal.  Besides this way I was able to keep the Mustang for a couple more months!

We chose the XL 4WD 4 Door Sport Utility for many reasons:  It would tow our boat, take us up to the mountains to go snow skiing and was large enough for our growing family.  This was a very comfortable vehicle.  It was great for our trips to the water and the snow.  There was plenty of room in the front and back for all passengers and of course our dog in the cargo area!

Our model had the 6 cylinder, 4.0 liter engine.  It was sufficient to tow a boat, great on gas mileage.  We never had to take it to the shop, except for the scheduled maintenance and oil changes.  The only problem I had with this vehicle was the seat belt cover/guard broke off for no apparent reason or abuse on our part.

When our lease was up on this vehicle we went to our favorite Ford Dealership to turn it into a purchase.  We ended up leaving with a 1999 Ford Expedition (please see my review on this product), I do not see a Excursion in the near future though!
