            For nearly two decades the Cavalier has been a staple sales leader for Chevy dealers. Understandably so, because
the Cavalier offers reasonable value and is priced low enough to compete favorably in the compact market, often
undercutting smaller models from other manufacturers. 

But small-car sales are suffering because of the strong economy and low fuel prices. Who needs a compact car
when a roomy sedan or sport utility is within financial reach? Nonetheless, the Cavalier is good transportation, offering
adequate room for four adults, decent performance and acceptable interior accommodations. Styling is attractive and
contemporary, and there is a model to suit almost everyone's needs. 

This year, Cavalier is offered in Base coupe and sedan, LS sedan and Z24 coupe and convertible. Fresh front and rear
fascias debut on the 2000 Cavalier, but you'll need to be sharp-eyed to tell the difference. Here's a hint: the 2000 model
has clear lens headlights. Z24 gets a more prominent spoiler, and two new five-spoke alloy wheel designs are
available on upper trim levels. The Chevy bow tie returns to the decklid, after a one-year hiatus. 

Inside, Cavalier is reasonably comfortable and well laid-out. A slightly revised instrument panel boasts new gauges,
digital odometer and tripmeter, and stereo controls relocated above the climate controls for easier access. The
center-console shift indicator is illuminated for 2000, and air-conditioning is standard on all Cavaliers. Stereos have
been upgraded in terms of power output, while uplevel systems gain RDS technology and automatic theft protection. A
dual-play cassette and compact-disc player is available. <br><br>
