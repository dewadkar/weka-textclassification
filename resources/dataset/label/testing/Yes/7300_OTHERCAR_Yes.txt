            I have been using the Olympus D-460Zoom now for about three months.  I was able to use it the first day without spending excessive time reading the user manual.  The manual, however, is written extremely well, providing easily understood language and illustrations when you do have a question or issue.

The camera and accompanying software (Camedia Master) are very easy to use.  Controls, including the menu, and various functions are easy to find.

My first set of batteries died after about two weeks of use.  I was able to find the identical replacement at a local camera store, but they cost more than I'm willing to spend on a regular basis.  

To address this problem, first, I tried standard throw-away batteries.  In my experience, I found the camera to use energy sparingly as I didn't have to replace the first set for about three weeks.  Per the user manual, I extended the life of the standard alkaline batteries by using the display window only when necessary.

While this worked at first, I noticed that downloading the images with standard batteries was extremely draining.  I realized that I needed to change my philosophy.  After going through two sets of alkaline batteries.  I decided to try the Eveready Rechargeable batteries for digital equipment.  Problem solved.  I keep the batteries charged regularly and the unit's performance is exceptional.

I mentioned the costliness of accessories.  Olympus offers a floppy disk add-on.  Actually, it looks like a floppy, but has a slot for the flash card.  This is an alternative to downloading your photos.  You place the flash card into the floppy and transfer the photos to your computer.  Neat!  The cost just seems to be a bit much.  At this time, I'll just continue to download. I purchased an electrical adapter that I use for downloading only -- a more frugal alternative.
