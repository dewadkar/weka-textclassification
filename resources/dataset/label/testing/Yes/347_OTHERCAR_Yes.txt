            Back in the early 90's, if you want to be cool and drive an SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), then you would drive a Jeep Cherokee.  The Cherokee was first of all - a Jeep - which carries a reputation in itself.  Second, it just looked and performed better than the cheaper General Motors or Ford wannabes.  

Now, the Cherokee has gone out of style.  Lately, the designers at Jeep have made it all too bubbly looking, and it became more sleek rather than rugged.  Ever wondered why you don't see too many new ones on the road?  At least not as many as you used to?

Year 2000 cars come out, and we are introduced to the X-Terra by Nissan.  This thing suddenly becomes the new 'in' SUV.  It is roomy, powerful, and best of all - affordable!  The X-Terra is built with much of the same parts used to make Nissan's pickup trucks.  By have interchangeable parts, this helps to greatly reduce the production costs of the vehicle.

The X-Terra comes in a wide variety of colors and trim packages, all of which may be researched on Nissan's company website.  The X-Terra could very well become the new grocery-getter or family vehicle, but it is also a quite capable off-road truck.  It comes with optional four wheel drive and lots of added features.  All X-Terra's even come with a nice First Aid Kit in the back.

The X-Terra handles unbelievably well.  It has a very sharp turning radius and the steering is smooth as can be.  This thing feels like driving a car.  The acceleration is very much like a car too, as the powerful 3.3 liter v6 motor quietly, yet firmly, moves you along at an impressive speed.  Honestly, I though a vehicle this size would move much more slowly.  I was quite wrong.

Another bit about this truck which I enjoy is the quiet ride.  Often times when you opt for a larger vehicle, you have to deal with a great deal of bumpiness and wind noise.  The Nissan X-Terra is a very quiet vehicle, inside and out.

Inside, the X-Terra has a LOT of headroom.  I am 6'2&quot;, so headroom is important to me, and I had a good 6-8 inches of space above my head.  The back seats also have plenty of room, so your rear passengers will not be cramped.  My dad sat in the back as I test drove it.  He is also 6'2&quot; and was totally comfortable.  His knees never touched the back of the driver's seat.

I have been test driving several vehicles in the past week, including the Honda Passport and the Chevrolet Blazer.  I plan on buying a 2000 X-Terra by the end of the week (silver 4x2 with all the extras).  You simply can't beat the price when you compare it's features to that of other like vehicles.<br><br>
