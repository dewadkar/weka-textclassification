            First of all, the picture you see on this page, is not, as noted, the GLE model but, in fact, it's the SE model with the 17&quot; wheel/tire pkg. The SE is the only model avail with such a pkg.
 I've been driving Nissans' for over 15 years now and, I find them to be of high quality build inside and out.
 I just purchased the 2000 Maxima SE 5 spd. What a car! After my last Maxima, which was a 95' model SE auto, this one is a completely different animal all together.
 The 2000 model, aside from it's new stand-alone, aggressive look, is an all around better car.
 The extra power is very noticable. The handling is crisper, and the interior is simply outstanding.
 I paid (in NY) 25.5g for the 2000 SE 5 spd, heated seats, comfort &amp; conv. pkg, 17&quot; wheel/tire pkg, sunroof, sunroof visor, mudguards, side airbags, floormats, which is an outstanding buy !
 So, if you're looking for a fun, fast, reliable, and fancy 4 door car, this is he one to for you !!! <br><br>
