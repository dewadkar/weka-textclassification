            Back in 1996 My older car broke down and I was in need of a new vehicle, I decided on the Mitubishi galant because it was a midsize vehicle, yet was sporty enough looking for my tastes. I have driven all over the country in my car, from Alabama, to Vermont and now I live in Hawaii and so far this car has given me no problems what so ever. I have 2 children who both easily fit int he back seat, and the trunk is very spacious and I belive is bigger than the average midsized vehicle's trunk. Also I am a short woman, only 5 feet tall and I can easily drive this car. Even though I only bought the base model of this car, I am still very very pleased with the performance and value of this car. <br><br>
