            I am a very happy owner to the suzuki esteem.  I went to the dealer of interest in a used vehicle, but they sent me home in the esteem. The price for the car is perfect for a family like me, trying to start off right finanically with a brand new car. I love how the car has bigger control buttons and a cd player.  The car is roomey enough for my three children to sit in the back comfortably too. The only disappointment is, when you buy the standard package vehicle, it does not come with a trunk light :( So it makes it hard to see in the trunk at night.

Driving my esteem is very nice.  It rides smooth and handles the roads and curves really well.  All in all we like how it drives and handles the roads :)

All in all, if your a family that doesn't have the best credit, but not the worst either (basically sitting in middle of both) then this is the car to buy :) You will be quite satisified with the results of how wonderfully suzuki subaru dealers will help you get into this very nice and cute ecomony car.
