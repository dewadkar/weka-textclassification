            After weeks of researching it was down to two choices, the Nikon CoolPix 800 and the Canon Powershot 100 (my criteria were portability, features, quality and price &lt;$1000can).  It was a hard choice since the two cameras are quite different, but I had to chose the one that I thought would get the most use, the Canon Digital Elph.

Sure you might get marginally better pictures (though I am very satisfied so far) out of other cameras but cameras don't take good pictures sitting at home.

This camera has a good feature set (for its size), takes above average pictures, has a fantastic macro quality (in comparison to other's I've tried), good construction, nice display and is above all extremely portable.

I would have liked to have seen a manual white balance option (though I have not needed it yet) and a manual shutter speed option (though you can sometimes fake it with creative photography).  Also I have some reservations about the battery and cf door quality though no one has ever complained of any breaking.

All in all, this is a fantastic camera.  Especially for those who don't mind sacrificing a couple of features (most of which never get used) for an extremely portable, fun and good quality (in both construction and image quality)camera that screams &quot;take me with you&quot;.<br><br>
