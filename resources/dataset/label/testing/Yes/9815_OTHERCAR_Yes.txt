            This is the all time best muscle car (in my opinion).  I love the rack and pinion steering the dual exhaust (sports performance package) you can get on the V6.  It handles great on every corner, sharp or not.  It's very smooth on highways, city roads, and back roads.  It also handles well in about a foot of water.  :)  

The seats are a little low but I like that.  And if people don't like them that low they can get power seats that go up down back and forward.  The leather seats are a plus in this car.  After sitting in one with cloth seats, it's gets a little uncomfortable.  To me the leather is just more comfortable and I've always loved bucket seats.  The back seats however, aren't all that.  It's already cramped as it is in the back and them they give you two small seats with a hump in the middle that gets really hot on long drives.  You're basically sitting back there with your legs to the side because there isn't enough room to have them in front of you.  

Now the trunk.  Who ever came up with that??  They give you an area big enough for the T-Tops (if you have those) and then you have no room for anything else.  What I'm thinking is that they tried to make up for that with the rear folding seat.  C'mon, how's that going to help?  Speaking of the rear folding seat...I didn't even know it did that.  When I found out I thought, &quot;Well, it's got enough room for my dog to sit there.&quot;  And I only have a medium size Border Collie.  

Now if you have the V6, be careful.  Don't drive it like a race car.  If you punch it all the time, count on replacing the rear differential.  Or if your lucky, only changing the gears in the car.  The more you punch it the more the pinion seal pops out and the more shavings from the bearings you will find floating around in the rear diff fluid.  

I've always loved the Camaro but I've always hated it.  It was great for the first 2 1/2 years and then I started having problems with it.  

All in all it's a great car as long as you get a V8.  I wouldn't recommend you buy the V6 unless you get the leather and T-Tops and the performance packages.  Then the V6 is a little faster and a little bit more stylish.<br><br>
