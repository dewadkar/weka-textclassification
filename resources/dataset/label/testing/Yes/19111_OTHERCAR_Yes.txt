            I just picked up an '01 Monte Carlo SS and it is obviously the best car ever made.  

It has beautiful, sleek, sexy, voluptuous lines which are a throw back to the early '70s Monte Carlo.  

The ride is schmoooooooth and handling is great.  My computer tells me that I'm averaging 32.4 MPG.  

If i want to know the temperature or open my garage door, I just press a button.

The turning radius is very good for a car its size.

The 3.8 is a tried and true engine that has 200 awesome HP but still sips gas.  

The Onstar system is awesome, just like the Batman commercials.  If I ever lock my keys inside,  Onstar will unlock the vehicle for me.  They can even interpret engine codes.  If the car gets stolen, they'll track it down.

The cloth, power seats, with lumbar support are extremely comfortable and easy to adjust.  

The instrument panel is well laid out and the tire pressure and oil life monitors are nice features.

The radio includes a cassette and a CD and is the best factory radio I've ever seen.  I really like how it adjusts its volume as the road noise increase and quiets down when you come to a stop.  The steering wheel has redundant radio controls which makes it very easy to change the station and adjust the volume.  The radio also serves to set all of the cars options like alarm, headlamp delay, trunk guard, oil life monitor, etc.

At night time, when you get out of the car, the headlights turn on for thirty seconds to light your path.   There's no need to ever turn on the headlamps because they automatically come on.

This car looks great and practically drives itself.  If I ever had to there would be enough room for me to sleep in the trunk.  The trunk also has a nice net in it where I put my groceries so they don't slide all over the place.

The DRLs, and ABS are important safety features.  The four wheel disc brakes stop the car in a hurry.

This car even has options for passengers, the passenger has their own climate control.

Best of all I got this car for thousands less than comparable models.  I've owned a 2000 Accord and the MC is such a better car it's not even comparable.

When it comes time to change the oil that will be easy to do myself since the oil filter is in a good location that's easy to get to.
