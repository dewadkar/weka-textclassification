            We like to keep our cars quite a long time, which is not hard, since they have been Volkswagens, and during the last couple of years we have them, we go and test drive *everything* that appeals to us at all, so that we are educated when we do finally purchase.  We are not blindly loyal to VW, but they just seem to have the most car for the money most of the time. 

The '98 VW Passat was redesigned for that year, and it was just so refreshingly new.  We liked it from the first test drive.  It felt heavier than the Jettas and Golfs that we were used to, and it has the 15" wheels, which means a smoother ride than the 14" or smaller wheels.  This was the first car this large that we would be buying.  There is so much leg room and head room, and the seats are the most comfortable that VW has offered.  

Once we drove the Passat, we were sold.  We bought the 4-cylinder standard transmission model with the heated leather seats.  We had never had heated seats, and I had thought, Boy, what a gimmick!  Well, unless the weather is quite warm, those heated seats are just great.  Even of a moderately cool day, it feels good to get in and warm up the seats, even if we turn them off soon.  This item just makes a world of difference in the comfort level, and people who have ridden with us have been very impressed.

Our Passat is a light aquamarine called Elegant Green, and it does turn heads.  It is a beautiful, soft shade.

I also rate the back seat favorably.  It is roomy and comfortable, with the head room and leg room for adults to ride in back, and we have had a number of people say that it is the most comfortable and roomy back seat they have ever been in!  I think many manufacturers look at the back seat as where the kids and maybe the dog rides, so how nice does it have to be?  Volkswagen makes every seat in the Passat comfortable for *adults*.

Unlike, it seems, most people, I don't car for a sun roof or moon roof, so I cannot comment on VW's, since our Passat does not have one.

We have had very little trouble with this car.  In fact, I don't recall any repairs.  We just got the regular maintenance.  We did have the front brakes relined, which surprised us a little, since we normally go a long time between brake jobs, but then, this car is heavier than our previous ones.  Nothing has actually broken on the car.  Reliability is the most important thing to us, and I think we got this with the Passat.

The main negative for me is the air conditioning.  We live in the West Virginia northern panhandle, where we certainly don't have the kind of hot weather they get in Miami or Phoenix, but I find the air conditioning to be just adequate.  I don't want the inside of the car to be frigid anyway, and with only moderately hot summer weather, the air conditioner is ok; it is adequate.  It just seems such a shame to me that they could build this wonderful car with the posh seats and beautiful styling, and then put in an air conditioner that is just not in the same league with the rest of the car.  Surely the ones they put on the market to sell in the South have different and better systems in them.  This a/c is just rather disappointing.

Like a couple of other posters here, I would like more cup holders, and maybe in metal rather than plastic in the front, where we use them a lot.

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a smooth ride with ease of handling in a car whose watchword is "reliability."  I would not recommend it to people who want really frigid air conditioning.  For those buying in hot climates, I would say, Take it for a long ride in the heat of the day and test that a/c out before you buy.
