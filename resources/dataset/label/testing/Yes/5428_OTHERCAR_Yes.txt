            I purchased a 2001 300M three weeks ago and love it.  I have 3000 miles on it and have never returned to dealer for anything.  No quality defects at all in the 3000 miles.

Options on car are the performance handling group, full size spare, chrome wheels, moon roof, spoiler, upgraded sound system, and after market tinted windows.  The reason for the 2001 was due wanting black and performance option, which I could not find on any dealers lots.  So the car was ordered and received in only three weeks.  Gas mileage runs about 24MPG for all types of driving and this car will move if that is what you want to do.

Tested other cars to compare, but once all testing was done and compared prices, 300M was the one for me. Big car inside, handle great, acceptable gas mileage, looks sharp, and most important-no problems.  <br><br>
