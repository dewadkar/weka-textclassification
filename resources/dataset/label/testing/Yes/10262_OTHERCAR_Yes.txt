            Well, I did not buy this car, but it is the first one I ever drove!  Yeah, it took the abuse from myself as a teenage driver, a couple bumps and bruises here and there, but this 10 year old car has not failed me or my family!  

I love the fact that this car is 10 years old and I am not embarassed to drive it because it looks sharp - mine is fire engine red and runs fast like one too!  

The soundsystem in it is great, even though it has taken abuse from three teenagers, including my self!  It is very reliable even though it has over 125,000 miles on it!  Its great for dates, traveling, going to work, hauling the friends and just driving around with the pets :)  It's as tough as a rock!  It's been in a couple of accidents, and still, I would trust it to drive from the east coast to the west over and over again!  

If you're looking for a used car - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A Subaru legacy!  I haven't experienced the newer ones but the 1990 is a sweet deal!  I fell in love with it!<br><br>
