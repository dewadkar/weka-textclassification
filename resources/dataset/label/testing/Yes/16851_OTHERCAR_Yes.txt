            As I am extremely cautious about how I spend my hard-earned money (seeing that I have no regular income), I spent about a month and a half researching the digital cameras available on the market before making my final decision. I wanted something to use for online auctions, and take pictures for my upcoming website. I was going to get the FD-73, but decided I might want higher resolution, so I stepped up to the FD-90, which was probably one of the best camera-buying decisions I've ever made. 

Originally one of my criteria was size. Yes, the Sony FD-90 is a little bulky because of the floppy drive, but all in all it is just a little bigger (and probably lighter) then an ordinary 35mm camera. 

The #1 selling point for me was the floppy disk storage.  I didn't want a camera that utilized a bunch of cables, which to me seems like more trouble than it's worth. I like not being tied to proprietary hardware and software interface. The floppy disk makes this camera absolutely simple to use. Shoot a picture and put the disk in your computer and the picture is there as quick as your computer can access the floppy drive, with no cables to hook up at all. I can take pictures anywhere, and if I need more &quot;film,&quot; I can stop at any supermarket or office supply store and pick up a box of floppies.  I have not used the new Memory Stick with this camera although it is an available option. For the price of floppies I don't foresee needing anything else. 

Another feature I like is the MPEG capability. For me this feature is basically a toy and is really only useful for placing small MPEG movies on a web site or for emailing.  There is a also a feature built into the flash that reduces red eye, which I really like.  

With the FD-90 you get a lithium ion battery and a charger so there will be no problem with that. I've been getting a full hour of shots with a full charge. Considering all the functions that are eating up the battery life, like flash and zoom, and hour is pretty good.  I bought a spare battery as well, but haven't had reason to use it, so far.   

I don't have much to complain about, but if I had to, I'd say that the zoom control is rather awkward, as it is located on the front of the camera.  In my humble opinion, they should have left it on the back  so you could work it with your thumb while working the shutter. It takes a great deal of dexterity to work the zoom while shooting a movie.

Overall I would recommend this digital camera for everybody. From the box it is very simple to use.  It's ready to go as soon as you get the first battery charged, and you're all set to have loads of fun.  I recommend reading up about the camera's features while it's charging up.<br><br>
