            First Off I need to clarify that I DID NOT purchase a Daewoo. A few weekends ago I found a cheap car to rent and wasn't sure what to expect. At first I was a bit apprehensive as I approached the Daewoo Lanos 4 door.  All I had heard about Daewoo was...well I had heard nothing. The name kind of frightened me and I was wondering if I would have to push the car with my feet just like Fred Flintstone.

After adjusting the seat to my liking I went on my two hour drive.  After getting used to where everything was located The car started to grow on me. Acceleration up to 60 was severely lacking, but when finally up at highway speeds the Lanos had no problem getting around a car here and there and I was able to approach 110 mph without the car shuddering.  I had to check it out you know!  

Overall I was happy with the Lanos and would recommend investigating the Daewoo Line if you are so inclined. Don't let the Korean stigma turn you away from the car.
