            My husband and I were in the market for a new car. After comparing the Nubira against the Jetta, Camry and Cavalier, we realized the Nubira was the best car for our money. (The Daewoo matched if not beat these three cars in these categories: gas mileage, standard features, options, warranty and price. The only thing it didn't have was side air bags, which the Jetta does.)  

Since the purchase, we have been nothing but happy. Our Nubira is a smooth drive and dead silent. It handles well and looks sharp to boot. In fact, when one of our friends saw our new car in the parking lot (from a short distance) they exclaimed &quot;Wow, I didn't know you bought a BMW.&quot;

We get close to 300 miles per tank. $16000 bought us leather seats, CD and cassette player, 36,000 mile full-service warranty (including oil changes and tire rotations) and driving luxury.

The only people that I can think of who shouldn't buy this car are off-roaders or families larger than 5!
