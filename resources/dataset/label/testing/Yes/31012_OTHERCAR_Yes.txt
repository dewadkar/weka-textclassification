            While waiting for some work to get finished on my 1996 Pontiac, I crossed the street to my local Dodge lot and checked on the (then) brand-new 2002 1500s.  My dealer only a had a few in at the time, and I wasn't the only one checking them out.  

I was automatically a fan of the prior Ram line, and was expecting big things from the new version.  I wasn't disappointed.  After getting the keys from the dealer, I checked out the inside and outside.  As always with the Ram, the inside is large and roomy (helpful when you're over 6 feet tall), with plenty of storage compartments.  I was rather surprised to see how much more they managed to fit into that cab!  And those full-size normally-opening doors where a great improvement.  I've rented and borrowed several pickups from Dodge and the competition, and while I liked the rear doors for their versatility, you always had the problem of having to open the front doors first.  Well, not anymore.

After looking at the tight assembly and clean lines, I fired up the 5.9 V8 and took her for a test drive.  Purposefully, I drove off of the curb while leaving the lot.  I hardly felt it.  Deciding to give the truck a real test, I drove some of the roughest roads in town, flung her around corners at high speeds, etc.  Not only did it ride better than most pickups, it rode over the bumps better than my luxury sports sedan!  And this was on the AT tires.  The bigger street tires ought to be impressive if you don't intend on getting your truck dirty.

The magnum V8's have always had lots of power and torque, but are, of course, less than fuel-efficient.  But considering how much it weighs and what's it's really designed to do, it could be a whole lot worse.  Pickups aren't designed to be fuel efficient.  That's a Honda.  Pickups are meant for working and playing, and this truck does that very well.  Still, hopefully, the new Hemi will improve both power and fuel economy and after a year or so (and a winning lotto ticket on my part), a new Ram will join my ever-changing stable of vehicles.

This Ram was very comfortable, had just about every option I'd want (I'd want to add a HUD), got reasonably good mileage, had decent power (I even managed to smoke the 17's while test driving), and is just, in my opinion, a great-looking truck.  I do heavily prefer the full-color sports-appearance option and the quad-cab over the single cab, but those are just my preferences.  If anyone is looking for a great new pickup and has the money (I don't at present, unfortunately), I strongly urge them to try out the new Ram, you won't be disappointed.
