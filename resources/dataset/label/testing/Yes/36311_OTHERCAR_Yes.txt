            I have owned my G35 for a week now.  I will write periodic updates to share my experience.  First of all, I spent about 9 month's researching semi-luxury sports sedans.  I looked at the Acura 3.2 Type S, Audi A4, Volvo S60, Lexus IS300, and the Infniti G35.  Some of my thoughts on the others.  
Lexus IS300: Scratched off my list early due to "racer-boy" looks and small size.  
Volvo S60:  Cheap interior look, sluggish steering and power.
Acura 3.2 TypeS:  Very nice ride and interior, very boring exterior.
Audi A4:  Liked nearly as much as the G35 but slower, and $3k more.

Infiniti G35:  I fell in love with this car the first time I test drove it.  Love the looks with the Sport Wheels and spoiler(really makes it stand-out).  Interior is gorgeous with the sport-package titanium trim highlights.  Power galore, great brakes.  I bought the Leather with Sport Package, Aero Package, Winter Package, Premium Package, Sunroof, Xenon lights.  The premium Bose stereo is nice however I wish there was a separate sub-woofer volume control.  My model is loaded except for the navigation package ($2K option that I don't need).  So far I am more than satisfied with this vehicle and will update as I put more miles on it.  I was able to get this for $1,300 under sticker after much haggling.

Only slight surprise is the ride quality is a little stiffer than I had expected.  This is more than likely due to the optional sport package springs and shocks.
