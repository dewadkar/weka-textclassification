            A few notes to start

This review was based on a 24 hour test drive and internet research. I do not own a RX8 as of the time of this review therefore I will not be able to provide any information regarding long term reliability. 

The model I drove was equipped with the 6 sp manual transmission. For further information about specific prices and options consult Mazda&#146s website &#150 www.mazdausa.com. 

How I got the 24 hour test drive

I didn&#146t really, well, not in the true sense of a test drive. I own a Mazda 6s (of which I wrote a review here on epinions) which is plagued with perpetual maintenance issues. About once a month my car spends a day or two in the shop to fix various things. I&#146m not happy about it in the least. A few weeks ago I dropped my car off because it was making a squeaking noise. Without getting into too much detail I&#146ll just say that the dealer, instead of fixing the problem (which they assured me they had) made it a lot worse. 

Given my poor service history this was the proverbial straw that broke the camel&#146s back. I contacted the district service manager about all of the troubles I have been having and in a good faith effort he arranged for me to drive an RX-8 as a loaner while they "re"corrected my squeaking problem.

Those 24 hours with the RX-8 are the basis for this review. 

First impression

Before arriving at the dealership I had seen commercials for the RX-8 and even poked around Mazda&#146s website virtually exploring the car. However I had yet to see the car in person. When I exchanged my keys with the service person he walked me around the corner to a bright red RX-8. 

Perhaps the sun rising on the horizon helped dramatize the color, but it was vibrant. It screamed excitement in a sultry "come hither" kind of way. 

The shape of the car is a bit odd. The rear half doors make for unfamiliar curvature and some awkward design flows. It&#146s not as seamless as the s2000 and it definitely doesn&#146t portray the muscle bound madness of a Mustang or Corvette. It is however, undeniably, a sports car. 

The front and rear of the cars are the most impressive angles to look at. The side has more of a "double take" quality to it. As in "what&#146s going on with those doors". If anything it makes the car an original as far as styling is concerned.

Interior

I slipped into the driver&#146s seat, which is noticeably lower than my 6. It reminded me a lot of driving an s2000. The seats wrap around to keep you snug yet they don&#146t fully restrain you. I&#146m a tall guy &#150 6&#1463". And that presented a bit of a problem. Although my head wasn&#146t poking out the sun roof my hair did gently brush against it now and again which can be rather annoying.

The black on red interior was a bit much for me, but color preferences are highly personal. Make your own decision. 

The petals were in good locations (aluminum), it felt very similar to my 6 so it was an easy transition. For the most part the cockpit layout has reflections of the 6, with the stereo/Air display at the center of the dash. This is something that took me a few weeks to get used to in my car, but once I did I now find it very intuitive. If you&#146re worried about the layout when you test drive, don&#146t let it be the deciding factor about whether or not you buy this car. It does however look really cool, everything is based around a circular form. Functionality comes with time.

The stereo was the familiar 6 disc in dash CD changer. With 9 speakers and 300 watts this thing can get cranking (although I&#146ve found the bass to get a bit muffled at higher volumes &#150 consider adding sub woofers if you&#146re a true audio-file). 

There are 2 front cupholders and 2 in the rear (I&#146ll get to that in a second) and even a dedicated sunglasses case which is great, you don&#146t have to worry about mingling your sunglasses with our objects which could scratch them.  There&#146s a change holder and a few other "niceties" that make this car as functional as it is sporty. 

A navigation system is an option, however the model I drove was not equipped with this feature. 

The rear seats are a lot larger then I expected. To access them you open the back half of the door (which opens from the center &#150 the front door must be open to do this). I sat back there for a few minutes and that was enough for me. As I said I&#146m a tall guy, the seats were a bit tight for a lengthy road trip. However it would be fine for jetting across town. 

Everything else is fairly standard, cruise control, tripometers (but not a trip computer) and the rest of the gages. 

One major disappointment is with the digital speedometer. I&#146ve never been a fan of them, it just seems "untraditional" to me. Although if you think about, this car is pretty darn untraditional. 

Driving

Turning over the Wankel rotary engine lacked the "throaty" sound one might expect from a sports car. However this is a major difference in the RX-8 -&#150 the rotary engine, not the sound it makes (which at high speeds sounds more electrical than anything). 

A twin-rotary engine is much lighter and smaller than the traditional piston engine yet delivers considerably more power. The RX-8 is equivalent to a 1.3 litre four cylinder yet delivers as much power as large capacity V6.  Essentially you get more bang for your buck. 

The rotary engine offers fewer balance problems than with a traditional engine. And because the engine is so compact it allowed Mazda engineers to mount it low in the RX-8&#146s engine bay, close to the firewall which gives you the equal distribution (50-50) balance which gives you stability and control that feels almost Audi Quattro like. 

The car&#146s spine as I came to call it (the raised center that runs the length of the car, which creates a striking interior visual focal point) offers additional stability and control. It&#146s certainly a solid car.

Pulling out of the dealership lot and onto the rural route on which it sits gave me a nice opportunity to open it up (which the dealership probably hated seeing). The rotary engine delivered what is promised, which is more than I expected.

It truly drives like a sports car. The clutch and transmission was fast, doing what I wanted it to do when I wanted it to do it.

I found the ride to be a lot better than the s2000. At low speeds it remained smooth which always seems to be a problem for sports cars of this genre. It&#146s a firm ride however, which can be attributed to the double wishbone suspension. 

I found the steering to be responsive and sharp, really no complaints at all. 

The only negative part of the drive was my shock in downshifting and having very little engine reaction. I&#146m not really sure of the physics of the rotary engine but I&#146m sure it has something to do with it. You definitely have to use your brakes when slowing down &#150 something that might catch you a little off guard (as it did me). 

Miscellaneous

I know it&#146s not a big deal, and there&#146s probably no room for it, but I&#146d really like to buy a car with a full size spare. 3 18" wheels and a donut &#150 come on. I find it almost insulting the lack of cars that offer a full sized spare, and Mazda, unfortunately doesn&#146t deliver one with the RX-8. Sorry.

The trunk itself isn&#146t that bad. Don&#146t plan on taking the RX-8 to any yard sales but it will get you to the airport with luggage (the back seat helps with that too). For a sports car, it definitely is a good size.

Overall

I was sad to return the RX-8. It&#146s a nice, well-built car. I enjoyed driving it as much as I enjoyed getting comments on it wherever I took it. The rotary engine is noticeably different than a traditional one, but not in a bad way. It&#146s a point of difference, something unique in a world of Accords and Camrys. 

Be prepared for the cost of owning this car &#150 it&#146ll set you back into the lower 30&#146s out the door, and insurance won&#146t be kind. Mazda highly recommends premium fuel (with the rotary engine, I can&#146t disagree) and the mpg isn&#146t all that great. You will be paying for premium fuel, and I certainly don&#146t see prices for that coming down anytime soon. 

And I can&#146t forget the reason why I got to drive the RX-8 to begin with. My car, a Mazda, has the reliability of an 82 Geo. I&#146d certainly wait a year for Mazda to work the bugs out, although admittedly I couldn&#146t find anything drastically wrong with the car (although I didn&#146t see anything wrong with my 6 which is why I bought it). I can&#146t think of any major oversights either (like Honda "forgetting" a clock in first year models of the s2000). 

The RX-8 is truly a spectacular car. Drive one, see if it&#146s for you. 

And maybe one day I&#146ll too join the "rotary club".
