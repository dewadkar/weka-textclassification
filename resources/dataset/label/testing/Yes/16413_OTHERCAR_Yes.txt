            This is overall a good camera that takes very good shots, probably comparable to a pretty decent 35 mm.  Only issue with the picture quality, sometimes the 3D effect is a bit missing (but this may be the case with digital photography of this level) and when there is limited light indoors, the photos aren't as good and do suffer.  But outside photos and well lit indoor photos are nice.  Closeups usually come out nicely also, with different zoom modes.  I have a lower priced 2 megapixel also and the Nikon's photo quality is a lot nicer (but this camera was almost double the price).    

What is really nice about this Nikon 775 is that is comes with a rechargeable battery and charger, which any digital camera user will soon find out is vital to having a pleasant experience.  The charger is quick and takes only about 1-2 hours to fully charge.  Having to buy one adds at least $35 to $45 to the price.

Also, as with any camera that comes only with 8-16 mb compact flash or smart media, one will probably want to upgrade to about 64 mb, which holds about 70 highest quality photos, and 110 medium quality photos.  The Compact Flash which comes with this camera is removeable, which means you have to take it out to use any other you buy, but it's good in the sense you can just switch between the two.  When deleting photos from the memory, I suggest all at once because it takes forever to delete one by one.  

The most annoying thing about this camera is it takes what seems like too long a time to shoot and capture.  Sometimes I lose my shots cause the scene has changed!

There are a variety of modes on this camera, which I haven't gotten to yet.  I stick to the fully automatic mode and it is easy enough, for those who want a simple point and shoot experience.

The camera is light, small, and compact and comes with a built in lens cover.  I suggest buying a bag for extra protection, which it doesn't come with.  It also comes with USB cable and software.  The software is ok, but I have found software from my HP lower end camera more to the point to use.  

All in all, if this camera fits your price range and you  get it, you'll have a camera which takes some really nice shots.  In terms of value, remember to factor in that it comes with a quick recharger and battery, which adds about $40-70 to the price when you have to buy one.  Remember to buy extra memory (Compact Flash).  I bought this camera in December 2001 for 379 plus tax in a store.  You can probably order it from BuyDig.com for around $329 today (Aug 2001) plus $20 shipping and if you live outside of NJ, no sales tax.  Other sites might have it for lower (I only used Buydig, can't comment on others).

Nikon is a good brand, and gives good quality, but, after shopping around in the last few days for a higher end camera for a friend, I have a feeling you might find a better value.
