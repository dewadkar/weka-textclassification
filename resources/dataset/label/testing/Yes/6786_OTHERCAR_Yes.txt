            Now while the five previous epinions users before me all did a thorough and excellent job of covering and describing the Defender 90, there are a few important points which I feel haven't been discussed yet, and thus I feel it's my duty to add my own two cents on why I chose to spend so much money on this truck.  

I own a 1995 Defender 90, which I bought used a while ago.  I am an avid four-wheeler and spend a ton of time off the pavement whether it's for the sake of playing in the dirt, or trying to get to an untouched section of the Texas coastline.  Bottom line:  for serious off road enthusiasts, the Defender 90 is the best, most capable truck on the market.  

First consider the most important part of any truck that is to be used off road: the axles.  The Defender 90 has two solid axles front and rear, these are true solid axles, no toy like independent suspensions.  The axles are large and beefy and look more like they came from a Ford F-250.  The axles are the true thing which separates the Defender from Jeeps, while jeeps do have solid front and rear axles, the best you can hope to have from the factory is a Dana 44 in rear and a 35 up front, over time with off-road use they will slightly bend and become un-alignable, I've seen it happen.  The Land Rover axles are massive, they have large 9 inch ring gears which means that the likely hood of ever breaking a tooth off the differential is slim to none even with lockers installed.  Now I won't lie, the axles aren't invincible, I broke the front driver's side axle shaft off-roading a year ago, but it was my fault, with the tire dropped into a hole and both differentials and transfer case locked, something had to go and it was the axle shaft.  A simple fix later that weekend in the backyard in about three hours and not a single problem since.  Also one really great thing about the Defender is that both differentials line up perfectly with the transfer case.  Most 4x4's have a center differential in the rear and one in the front to the right or left.  With the Defender and all Land Rovers the differentials are all in a single line on the right side of the truck which makes it almost impossible to ever hit a rock with the rear pumpkin.  This could be better if the setup was located on the left side so the driver could have a better idea of how to line up obstacles, but it is an English truck, and in jolly old England the driver's on the right.  

Another huge advantage the Defender has off road is the transfer case.  The D-90 is full time four wheel drive, while that does burn a bit of gas, it has the advantages of not losing power while turning, and most importantly a center locking differential.  Most part time four wheel drives lose power when their wheels are at full lock, this is because the tires aren't exactly the same size in the front as they are in the back, when you start to turn the front differential isn't turning at exactly the number it should, and thus a bit of binding occurs making the car seem to stall.  The D-90's full time four wheel drives don't have this problem, not a big deal on a rainy street, but the difference between stuck and continuation in a deep mud hole full of ruts.  The other great thing about the D-90 is the center locking differential, when off road the driver can select to lock the transfer case and divide the power 50/50 between the front and rear axles, instead of the standard 40/60 or less most part time units have.  This is great for really tough rock crawling where speed is super slow and lots of power and traction are required.  However, do it at too high a speed and your transfer case will be shredded.  

This truck's suspension also gives it several advantages off road.  Front and rear are both three link coil sprung suspensions.  What that means is that the axle is suspended  from the body by two large coil springs.  What keeps the axle from falling off the truck are the three large links.  Up front, the suspension is located by two large radius arms which connect to the axle where the coils are and run up to the frame a couple of feet behind the axle and the same occurs in the rear.  However, while the third link up front a panhard bar, the rear has an A frame link which attaches to the axle via a huge ball joint.  The A frame acts as both an extra link and panhard bar preventing both side to side and downward motion.  Articulation is by definition the movement of one end of an axle downward while the other side moves upward, only trucks with solid axles can truly &quot;articulate&quot; and the Defender 90 does this superbly, especially in the rear. The coil springs really allow the tires to stuff into the fender wells and droop all the way down on the other side, this is one suspension which as had lots of time to be tested, it's been virtually unchanged since 1983.  The system is a bit more complicated than anything else out there, and I hope I did an adequate job of explaining it, but if you want any more information, please e-mail me and I'll be glad to clarify anything.  

The engine is a Buick designed 3.9L V-8 which is all aluminum, a new crank shaft was introduced in 1997 which increased the cubic size of the engine and overall horsepower slightly but did little to affect torque.  It has more than enough power for both the street and trail, it won't win any quarter mile drags, but is a demon in terms of low end torque.  If the numbers still don't impress you, the Rimmer company of England offers a supercharger kit.  The transmission is the tried and true Land Rover five speed manual, which is fantastic and has not let me down once.  It still has the stock clutch and has not given me a bit of trouble.  The only transmission offered in 1994 and 1995 was the manual, and the automatic was the only tranny offered in 1997.  I'd be skeptical about the Land Rover automatic transmission, almost every other Discovery solid in 1996 had serious transmission problems and I believe several 1997 models were also susceptible: definitely have a trustworthy mechanic check the transmission on a 1997 model before buying.  

Finally a few final things which really benefit the Defender 90 which are easy to overlook, the intake is mounted very high in the engine compartment and to the rear, it's almost impossible to drown this vehicle and if you're still worried there are plenty of aftermarket snorkels available.  The battery is hidden underneath the driver so there is little chance of water and dust damage, the interior is simple and functional, not to mention very easy to clean.  It comes standard with a solid roll cage MOUNTED TO THE FRAME which will really work in a roll.  It's possible to mount 32x12.50 R16 tires on it stock, with most other vehicles you'd have to lift them to get tires of that size on.  Finally, there is a wealth of aftermarket parts available from several manufactures, from bumpers, to stereos it's all out there.  Right now I've got a box in the garage with Safari Gard's stage JEK stage II lift in it waiting to be installed later this month.  Parts and service isn't cheap, but it's a simple and straightforward truck to work on, and any shade tree mechanic with experience can do pretty much anything the truck requires.  

Well, that's my review, thanks for taking the time to read it, I haven't talked much about ride quality or gas mileage, because I feel that the previous posters have done a great job of that.  I just wanted to let readers out there know why I bought the Defender 90, because it's simply the best off road truck on the market today.
