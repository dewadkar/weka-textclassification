            My husband and I bought our 2000 Chrysler Cirrus LX in September of this year and we are absolutely pleased with our purchase. We were in need of a new vehicle because I was involved in an accident, which totaled our previous vehicle. It was a 1993 Ford Escort LX. We had the car for eight years and had all intentions of keeping until it died. But the accident happened first.

We shopped and shopped through so many cars, I didn't even feel like getting one by the time we were finished looking. We examined Ford, Saturn, Chevy, Kia, Hyundai, and Chrysler. Originally, we were going to go with a small vehicle. Somehow we slowly ended up looking at the mid-size Cirrus. It was the first car we looked at and after we thought of everything, we decided the Cirrus would be the best vehicle for our money.

It's a silver, 4-cylinder, four-door sedan, with a sunroof (which we are in love with), cruise control, keyless entry, power windows and locks, childproof locks, power drivers seat, tilt steering and AM/FM Cassette player.

The car has exceptional room in the front and rear areas. The front seats are perfect. Everything is perfect for us, from the arm rest being at a comfortable height, to the gear shift being in a natural position. Also, the view from the windshield is also without obstruction. The rear seats are large enough for a full sized adult to be quite comfortable. There are also two rear cup holders. We have two children (three every other weekend), and there is definitely plenty of room for them. (One is in a car seat.)

The ride is surprisingly smooth and quiet. I believe it to be due to being a heavier car, than a typical 4-cylinder. It's a 2.4 liter DOHC, so it has a good bit a pep to the take off. It responds on cue to any changes in braking or acceleration. 

The mileage is average for that of a midsize car. It gets approximately 20-22 miles per gallon. It takes about $23-$25 to fill it up with our gas prices being $1.39/gallon.

The trunk space is more than adequate. The door not only lifts up, but it goes back, away from you when you open it, giving you more head room. It also has the standard seats that fold down for extra space.

The Cirrus is overall sharp. It's appearance is classy and it has the look of being an overprices car!!

The only things I would have liked to complete the car would've been alloy wheels and a CD player. But those can always be purchased down the road. 

We got a great deal on the Cirrus for two reasons. We bought it at the end of the model year, and we put enough money down to get the 2.9% financing.

As far as the mechanics of the vehicle, my husband says he'd like to get a better look at the brakes. He says they are soft, but I say it's just the way they brake. Nothing about them has changed since we bought the car, so I don't think there's a problem. But since I'm not the 'genius' of vehicular braking systems, I'll let him ease his doubts.

So, in a nutshell, we love the car. It's a great value for the money. It's sleek and comfortable and roomy. The 2000 Chrysler Cirrus is a smart looking car. Too bad they're not making them anymore.<br><br>
