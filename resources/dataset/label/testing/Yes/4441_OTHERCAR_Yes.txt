            97 Acura 2.2 Cl 60,000 miles (pre owned)

I recently owned an 86 Honda prelude whom I loved dearly. My other half drove it and basically totalled it out. Needless to say I was in need of reliable transportation and my job was good and stable I wanted to step up...way up. So I did. I made my first stop at my local Acura dealership. They treated me great (for a kid of 19) and stopped at nothing to get me what I wanted. I first test drove a 97 3.0 CL, and of course I was extremely impressed. Power was good, the engine was louder then I would have expected from an Acura, and the interior was ok. This model had cloth seats. That's rite...cloth. I didn't know you could get a 3.0 with out leather. I then turned to another, I was really wanting a 5 speed but they only offer the 5 speed on the 2.2's. So I test drove the 2.2. Call me crazy but that 4 banger seemed to get up and move much faster then the 6 I drove before. To top it all off the 2.2 was primrose (a silver pink) apposed to the red of the 3.0. The 2.2 also had leather and all the goodies I had been looking for, and it was a few thousand cheaper. So why not get the 2.2.

Ownership:
The bad-

Now perhaps I should not be writing this at this time because I have made the decision to take the car back to the dealership to be inspected. I have a few gripes. One of which is the idle with the a/c on. The engine will sometimes vibrate, not very bad but still I can feel it, and in some FEW cases the dash bored will vibrate. No one seems to notice but me the driver. Now my prelude of 188 thousand miles did the same thing but I expect that. This is a 97 Acura with 11 years of research and development in just the Acura existence alone, not to mention the knowledge that Honda owns and passes down the line. I found this to be disgusting and the more I think about it the more upset I get. Another is the a/c itself. It does blow cold, however when sitting at idle it gets a little warm inside the cabin (I'm in Az by the way). I've driven and been in many other cars to know that the time it takes for the a/c to warm up at idle should not be as fast as this car. I'm thinking a recharge is in order. And my last gripe. The peaceful serenity we called the interior cabin. It should be exactly that, peaceful and serene. This car is not! Perhaps I expect to much seeing as how I worked at Jaguar and I've driven all the Premium cars, Lexus, Audi, BMW, Auston Martin, Porshe, Infinity, Jaguar, Land Rover, and to name a few others. I've driven them all, and I've driven all the models. I have a good idea on what is to be expected of the premium car market. Now this may or may not come as a surprise to you but Toyota, yes That's rite Toyota. The Toyota Camry is by far much better in terms of road noise then this car. Now don't get me wrong, you may think I really dislike this car, you could not be more wrong. In fact I am an avid Honda loving freak. But I'm not going to boost this car in areas that are not in its fine points. Like any car it has weak points, and I'm here to inform you about them. I will put it this way. If you want quiet, you should look at a Lexus, Audi, or Jaguar.

The good-

No car can come out of the factory doors without having at least one good quality about it. And this car has More then I can possibly list. The seats front and back are extremely comfortable. And what goes with the comfort of the car is the ride itself, even though it is not as quiet as I would like for an Acura the ride is spectacular. It holds the road not like on rails but like fly paper. Its sticky and grippy. However on hard power turns there tends to be a bit to much body roll and some drift but That's normal for those 215/55 tires. The 5 speed transmission is a dream come true. I love the way it feels when I go though the gates, it locks on with a sense of assurance telling you &quot;your in&quot;. The thing that gets me the most on this car is the engine. While pulling the revs up to the red line it sustains its cool, and flutters not. When driving thru traffic you can actually feel the VTEC working. Even though you might have a 5 speed at times it actually feels like you have an automatic. The change in power while keeping in the same gear can be detected for either power or a downgrade for preserving precious fuel. I love it but I could see how some people would think its not refined enough. While driving at night(if you own one) you will notice that the standard head lights they put on this car lacks lumens. MANY LUMENS. Passengers repeatedly ask me if i have my head lights on because you simply cannot see the road at night. The brights however are quite the opposite. If the Hubble needed a flash light this car would be it. I took matters into my own hands. I went out and spent 50 dollars to get some Xenon HID head lights. The ones that say &quot;Caution, do not replace factory bulbs with this product, for OFF road use only, NO highway driving&quot; Why they say this I have no clue. All the high end manufacturers like Lexus, Infinity, and the newer Acura's have the very same bulbs in them. Irregardless of that fact I put them in any ways and it was a snap. Didn't take but 2 minutes for both lights. I must say that those Xenon bulbs made all the difference in the world. Its like I don't need my brights any more. Last but not least is the cars performance as a long distance runner. This is where the car excels. It is a true cruiser. The car can easily obtain 120 MPH and I've been told by a friend who owns one it actually goes as fast as the speedo suggests (I say suggest because I feel the car is wanting me to do this). That's rite 140 MPH. Not like we have an autobahn here in the states but its still nice to know when you have a stock sport cars trying to race on the highway with speed limiters on them. Its a good feeling. As well as how well the car handles at 120 MPH. It is almost as if the car actually gets increasingly smooth as you go faster. There comes a point were the car must lift off the ground and glide over the road. It actually feels like that.

Overall its a fantastic car, but like any car you have to know what you need and want in your new car. Like I said if you want a bone quiet ride then go for a Lexus, if you want a fun luxury coupe and down mind some road noise get this car. And trust me if you get a 2.2 please opt for the 5 speed. It does make a difference. One more thing before I go. The car says regular octane fuel. This is true, HOWEVER you have a VTEC engine at your disposal. I know some of you have tried the regular and premium fuel, and have not noticed a difference. Well I'm sure you have not had a VTEC engine. These engines are made for performance and even though the car can operate on regular fuel, putting in premium fuel will give you whiplash its that good.

That is all.
