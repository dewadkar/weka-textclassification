            My 99 Cougar has been with me for 14 months and other than a problem with people constantly scratching and chipping the paint from staring inside my precious car, it is a joy..fast, responsive and a blast to watch her go on an open road, she draws attention and is very user friendly. I am 5 ft 3 and can reach all controls, my sons are 6ft and both 300 lbs and never have any complaints about the car..must not, they fight to borrow it &quot;to pick up babes.&quot;  While the back seat is small, for my family who doesn't carry many passengers in this car, it suits to a tee, gives me everything I need while being beautiful!! I would buy another one in a heartbeat!!!Love the kick-butt stereo! 

My only complaint: The spring on the back hatch is too tight and not tensile enough to release always..when it acts up, I have to pull down on the spring and it will work for a month or so.<br><br>
