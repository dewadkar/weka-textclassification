            I think it's important to point out, right off the bat, that when I review this car, I don't compare it to cars that aren't in its class regarding size and price.  Hence, any statements I make regarding its pros and cons are made with consideration specifically to cars with which the 98 Corolla would compete (e.g. Honda Civic, Volkswagon Jetta, Ford Focus, Nissan Sentra, etc.).

Inevitably, when shopping for a car, price is always the leading determiner.  No matter how much I may love a car, if the price isn't right, then I don't buy it ... plain and simple.  I bought my '98 Corolla (used) in March 2001 for approximately $9,700.  It had approximately 30,000 miles at the time (though it has nearly 60,000 miles now).  Many other cars in its class such as the Jetta and Civic would have been several thousand dollars more (the Sentra would be in same price range).

When I bought my car, I made the decision based on several criteria.  The first of which, as I mentioned above, was price.  Once I narrowed down my price range, it became a search for the car that was most reliable, fuel efficient, safe and comfortable.  The Corolla fit all of these for the following reasons:

This model was a complete redesign of the prior year's model.  New features included significantly improved safety, sleeker design, more power, better fuel efficiency, about 2 cubic feet of additional interior space and a significantly larger glove box.

The fuel efficiency (again with economic perspective) was a big thing for me.  I do a ton of driving, as when I bought the car, I was commuting from Baltimore to Washington DC on a regular basis for my internship ... a 120 mile round-trip affair.  The car was average nearly 30 miles per gallon on a trip that included both highway and in-city driving.  An example of great fuel efficiency in this car is that I can drive from Baltimore to Miami for less than 75 dollars (and that was when gas was at its most expensive).  A full tank is about 11 gallons and will take you well into the 300 mile range.

Afterward, I took into consideration safety features.  In reading reviews online and results from crash testing, I found that the Corolla was the standard in its class by which other cars were measured.  Simply put, this car is far and away the safest car in its class.  Fortunately, I've not had to test this out (no accidents).  However, safety features in this model include: de-powered air bags (these do the job without hitting you as hard ... hence, safer); belts in all 3 rear-seat positions; and available as options are anti-lock brakes and side air bags (options are based on which model of the Corolla you purchase ... mine is the LE, the highest of the models, and had these options included).

Next, I looked at reliability.  I asked around, talked to mechanics and friends who owned Corollas.  Everyone I talked to said that I could expect this car to carry me comfortably for years without fear of constant trips to the repair shop.  Inevitably, when I took reliability of a car into consideration, the Jetta, Nissan, Ford and others were ruled out, and it became a choice between the Civic and Corolla.  While the Civic is very similar in quality to the Corolla, it's more expensive, so it was ruled out inevitably.  Sure enough, I've put 30,000 miles on the car since March 2001 and it's only been in the shop for new tires.  Granted, it's due for its 60,000 mile servicing, but that's standard with just about any car.  Essentially, if you get your oil changed every few months and make sure your fluids are maintained properly, this car should last an eternity.

Now, on to the fun stuff.  This car is packing a 1.8 liter engine with 4-cylinders (though I believe the LE may be available in a 6-cylinder, mine is the 4).  It's not the fastest or quickest thing on the road, but it accelerates just fine.  Driving to and from Baltimore and Miami, I had absolutely no problems getting in and out of congested traffic, taking the car up to 3 digit speed, etc.  In fact, I found that its accelerated from 60-80 was surprisingly good.  This car can move just fine with standard engine.  120 horses in this car is not a ton in absolutely terms, but considering its weight (2,500 lbs approx.), it carries the load just fine.

Finally, its comfort is just as good as any other car in which I've ridden in that class.  I had absolutely no discomfort sitting in the car for 16 hours straight as I've made the Baltimore-Miami drive 6 times since last year.  The stereo is perfectly adequate in the LE, equipped with tape deck and the option to install CD player and run through standard stereo already provided.  As for storage, I regular drive my wheelchair-confined friend around and can easily fit her chair in the backseat or the trunk.  Granted, I don't ask my friend Bill, who's 6'3 and 300 lbs to sit in the back seat (he gets the shotgun) ... but I wouldn't ask him that in any other car in this class.

Essentially, if you're looking for a smaller mid-size car that is reliable and affordable, I don't think you can do any better than this car.  I've heard zero complaints regarding its performance, and I certainly have none myself.
