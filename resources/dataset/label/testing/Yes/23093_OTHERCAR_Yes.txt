            I wanted a decent camera at a reasonable price, thus I found the Polaroid PDC 640 Plus.  It is a very appealing buy at around 149.99.
  This camera has 640x480 resolution with a large lcd and optical viewfinder.  It comes with a 8 mb SmartMedia card.  It has autoflash, auto off, red eye reduction.  It has macro,close-up, and normal focal ranges.  Equiped with auto timer and a tripod mount.
  It uses jpeg compression.  Time date stamps photos.  Can hook up through serial cable.
  This camera comes with the photomax software.  You can edit pictures.  Adjust color, crop, or add special effects to your pictures.  The software also lets you print stickers.  There is a feature to auto cut out image and apply to already made pictures.  It is nice software.
  The camera is boxed with a camera case, carry strap, software and all manuels.
  Their is obviously better cameras out there on the market, but for the money, I think you can't go wrong.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Polaroid has put good quality digital images in every ones grasp.  Thanks for reading.
