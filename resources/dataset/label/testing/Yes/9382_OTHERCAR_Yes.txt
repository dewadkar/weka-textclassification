            I leased my 1999 VW Jetta because I was tired of driving a station wagon!  I was longing to drive a small, cute and peppy car.  I had never owned a German car before, and I was really interested in getting a QUALITY vehicle.  

I chose a white Jetta Jazz with a black interior.  The Jazz edition is a GLS that comes with a few special items...power moonroof, eight speaker stereo, 6-disk CD changer in the trunk, alloy wheels and power door locks.  I also got the manual transmission.  Driving a &quot;stick&quot; had been something I never was very good at.  I was ready to conquer my fear of shifting!  So, my '99 Jetta was my first (and only!) &quot;stick.&quot;

The 1999 Jetta is a peppy little car with a lot of kick.  I don't know if it's the German engineering or what, but this car is a breeze to shift.  I have driven many other cars, and always had trouble.  The Jetta was easy and I was a PRO within a week!  

This car was the most fun to drive of any car I have ever owned!  (And that's an honor....I have had a 1992 Mustang, 1989 and 1994 Le Barons and a 1994 V-8 T-Bird, among others.)  It hugs the road and just is a really joy to drive.  I found myself volunteering to run long errands for friends and family--just to have an excuse to go for a long drive!  The steering and suspension are very tight--and that gives the car a really sporty feel.

I found the interior to be roomier than I expected.  I also was very impressed with the spacious trunk.  The driver's seat was very comfortable as well.

The only drawback to the Jetta, was that it didn't do very well accomodating two childseats.  We decided we needed to trade it in on a larger car, after our second child was born in 2/99.  We'd always kept our then 3yo's safety seat in the middle of the back seat.  Once her younger brother came along, both childseats had to be in outboard positions.  My daughter's head was sometimes smacking her window, so I reluctantly swapped it for a minivan.  

We are hoping to replace my husband's car soon--and we are seriously considering getting another Jetta, as we were very happy with the one we had.
