            To most of the car owning population Saab is not a name synonymous with desirability.  

In fairness to those who are considering this automobile, but have mixed emotions, I'd like to share some of the inside info with you.  I am presently employed by a dealer in a technical capacity and my background is primarily European transportation.  

What makes this car a solid value goes beyond what you can see.  I have written reviews on Volvos and by comparison this car handily out performs the Volvo in many ways.  This car is fuel efficient, especially the 4 cylinder. The interior seating is designed to carry real people in any seating position. On road, this car tracks well, is smooth, quiet and fun to drive.  Sophistication is not always a bad word in this business if the technology works. 

Working on these vehicles is relatively easy with the proper support, and tools.  Several reviews pointed to a poor response from the infrastructure at Saab but this has been turned around, and in most cases if there is a legitimate concern or problem they are going to great lengths to resolve the issues.

Much of what had brought a loyal following to Saab has been lost to some extent and the involvement of GM has somewhat caused some bumps in the road.  What now has emerged is a well designed package that will far surpass the expectations of the general buying public.

Tire wear, an area that really hurt Volvo due to poor suspension design, is especially minimal across the board in the Saab product line.

 Alignment, another weak area for Volvo, is about the best there is.  I have yet to align a new Saab for a pull or any complaint but I have worked on other European makes that should be aligned almost as soon as they are off the boat.

Reliability, this area could still use some improving as some of you may have read about some owners horror stories but as a rule this car is better than most.  A recent article published in Automobile magazine cited that in 31,000 miles their test car returned once to the dealer for headlight bulbs.  Currently we are tackling a few computer glitches, mostly 99 model 9-5 but this car driven responsibly should deliver years of reliable transportation.

Not everything is a thumbs up here as I would not like to leave the impression that this car is perfect.  Here is what to watch out for:  After the warranty expires some of the parts prices are beyond reality in comparison to other European product and I would encourage anyone to shop for aftermarket vendors who specialize in European cars for comparisons and bigger ticket items should at least look into the used parts category.  

There is a dash information unit that is know as the SID and in the event you need one when you are out of warranty this will cost you about 500% more than what it should cost.  The routine services that are recommended are generally pricey.

Regrettably, the cost of ownership and maintenance is the weakest part of the product and I hope that people who have some say so at Saab read this and other reviews and get a clue.  When you have a winner don't get too high on yourself, just ask BMW.  Years ago when I bought BMWs I experienced similar panic attacks regarding repair pricing and through the consumers voting with their wallets and massive lost sales to aftermarket sources BMW gave in and adjusted their parts and service pricing.  Hey we all like to keep a little more of what we make when we can and we all like to be satisfied with our purchases.

To put a wrap on this thing go drive a Saab 9-5 and you tell me if I am wrong.  Even with the few cons this car should be around for a long time.

Oh I almost forgot (102nd)  For the romantics the glove box has a port fed by the air conditioner to keep your champagne chilled.....Cheers!
