            I labored for three months in this tier and picked the Acura TL for three reasons, luxury/all standard features, turn-key reliability and NAVIGATION!  What a dream to have...but the car has its good and bad points...it has personality and it may or may not be your cup of tea.  Essentially, it is a smooth ride with understeer and soft trans shifts and typical honda mediocre brakes.  It will not turn heads (nor is it likely to get stolen).  But it is solid and predictable and comfortable and did I tell you its got a built-in navigation option....well, I can't sell that too much.  It should be standard on all cars, especially rentals.

Acura has it all wrapped up on reliability as do the Toyota and Nissan crowd...sorry, I own BWM too and it IS nice but it ain't there.  Maybe the VW or some others but I check Consumer Reports and they tell me every time what I will complain about downstream like they were clairvoyant.  Basically, most faults come from design or manufacturing processes that stamp out the same stupid mistake (or subtle hidden one) over and over again and the feedback will predict failures every time.  So look at CR and see who is phenomenal...the ultimate answer, Toyota, period.  The Lexus, however, demands a fairly steep price even if so nice.

Next is Acura so I went there.  Also looked at everything in this tier and above.  The only competition were the Infiniti/Maxima pair (similar but distinct cars), and I also considered the RX300 as a SUV blend.

Now I didn't really want a new car in the first place but my Sterling fastback got dashed by a friend and I was forced into this.  There are no 5 doors out there that you can depend on.  Saab comes as close as possible but then you can't really depend on it long term.  Really could not stand to think station wagon, so I settled on sedan with the following priorities (which I did compromise).

First, 4-doors...sorry but it is only civilized, really.

Second, reliable...as I have said above.

Third, good back seat...Infiniti is best here (maxima is even better), Acura and Lexus are a wee tight.  This one haunts me but I really don't fill the back much, just feel apologetic about it.

Fourth, fold-cown back seats.  Nope, Acura loses here.  The pass-thru is just a joke, UNLESS you carry just one pair of skis and don't mind the trunk draft.  Acura needs to fix this in particular.  On the other hand the trunk is best in class, big.

Fifth, all the goodies...Acura only comes with it all.  Nice touch and it does so under any other price!!

Sixth, navigation.  This became important because I just showed up in CA and am lost way too much.  ADD $2K.  Built in, speaks to you, good graphics and reasonable database (needs more).  I figured it would save my precious off time and help in various ways for learning the neighborhood.  Then too my visitors would be able to get places they would never otherwise go in LA area.  Acura ended up with the winning vote on this alone.  You cannot believe the value here.  It has saved me immense time in just two months of ownership...also my visiting friends.  After market units are jibe even if they are the same manufacture; you have an ugly gooseneck thingy, no touch screen (a remote, can you imagine), no voice so you can keep your eyes on the road where they belong, no DVD which covers the whole country in one disk.  Built in is the only way to go.

I was down to Nissan and Acura and Toyota by this point and I went with the navi.  I really like the car but there are some irritations.

Acura should have killer brakes (come on you are winning F1 afterall.)
Acura should have fold down back seat.
Acura should concede two inches from the trunk to the back seat legroom and pop the top a inch or so too while you are at it.

Else you will love this car if you want an ride.  If you want to sport, get a sports car.  It is not a crisp shifter, nor quick handling car.  It is short of the touring luxury it was chasing.  But you can ride it all day and sundays too without getting weary.

Look hard at the Nissan Maxima if you want cheaper, the Infiniti I30 for crisper, roomer, and the Lexus ES if you like the best and are willing to give a few thou to get it.  The Avalon is impressively roomy if you got that cash extra too, just not as prestigious.  And really look at the RX300 if you are looking for versatile; I just couldn't get used to the high, unstable feel, even it is not in reality.

Best of luck on your shopping.
