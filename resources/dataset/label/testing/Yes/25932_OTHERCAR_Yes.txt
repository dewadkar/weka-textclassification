            Me and my husband just bought our Grand Am GT in July.  We are yet to have a problem with it.  The reason why we bought it is because we were going to have a baby and we needed a family car.  At the same time we wanted a sports car.  The Grand Am GT works perfectly for us and our baby. 
This car is great on gas.  Another nice thing is that, you can pop the the trunk and unlock the car with out having to use the key.  Not only that but, the car comes equipted with 6 speakers and a subwoofer for excellent sound while your on the road.
 I love driving the car because a lot of people compliment on it.  Half the time they think its a 4 door Mustang.  I feel anyone should buy this car.  Wether its for your own pleasure or for your family.  Its GREAT!!!!!!<br><br>
