            Allow me to preface this brief review by saying  that I bought this car with a specific purpose in mind.  At 7 months pregnant with my first baby, I knew I needed to get rid of my zippy Acura Integra I had been leasing and move up into a car that would basically be run until it died.  My exhusband and I had a great experience with Subaru and I knew that that brand was going to be my choice.  With that in mind I also knew that it needed to be a "Mommy Car" which would let my family grow without becoming out of date or unreliable as the years went by.  I was also determined to buy the car used to save some money.

The choice was either the Subaru Forester or the Outback for this task.  In the end the Outback won out for the following reasons:
 
1. Cargo space is a little bigger in my mind in the Legacy for some unknown reason.  A great example is taking my parents to the airport.  My parents travel from Europe with three large hard suitcases and 3 carryon roller bags plus a purse and briefcase.  I was able to fit the luggage, my parents and my SO and my 8 month pregnant self into this car without being creative or any problems.  The car handled as if we didn't have the huge load from Philly to JFK airport and I was incredibly impressed.

2. Headspace in this car is very generous.  I'm not a tall woman, but my SO is and this son of mine is bound to grow up to be like his daddy (6' MINIMUM).  Even in the back seat the headroom is comfortable.
 
3. Heated Seats and Mirrors are, I admit, really are a luxury and should be noted as an extra feature.  However, I used the heated seat to comfort my pregnant body while I was en route to the hospital for deliver and it helped enormously!  Plus it is nice to turn the cat on, heat the mirrors and the seats, scrape your car and get into a toasty car to rid your bones of the chill!
