            This car is nice and &quot;cozy&quot; and I felt very comfortable driving it. My poor car was just a car with bad luck (i.e. being hit many times, &quot;freak&quot; accidents like a carwash rod breaking and putting a hole in it, etc.). It was recently totalled in a rear-ender, a Ford Explorer crumpled my trunk like aluminum foil. The car rode very low to the ground, which caused problems on bumpy roads and dips, but nothing major. The dash put a bad glare on my windshield, and there was a decent amount of warranty work done on it. I HIGHLY recommend getting the Extended Warranty on this vehicle, I really got my money's worth on that. This car was great for me in high school and college, and is also good for young couples. It drove pretty well, except some transmission annoyance from first to second. It had an adequate amount of room and trunk space, and made me feel at ease driving, as opposed to some bigger cars. The factory stereo system was impressive. It's a great starter vehicle, and at a good price. But I wouldn't recommend a 1995. The ones made later dealt with some of the problem issues like the dash and transmission. i wouldn't recommend a sport neon. I didn't see much difference except the big one on my insurance rates.    <br><br>
