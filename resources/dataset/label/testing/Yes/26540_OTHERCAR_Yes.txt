            I have a 1991 Chevy S-10 Pickup, Durango Series.  Chevy makes Great Trucks, very dependable.  I have not yet had a problem with this truck, and it has 130,000.  These trucks will definately last through 250,000 miles.  The A/C is cold, the Heat is hot, Everything is great.  I have the extended cab version, and it has been a great help.  The extra room gives the truck that much more room to store stuff.  Great acceleration and power.  Solid V6 engine.  The only drawback is the rear wheel drive.  I would prefer all wheel drive on those wet and slick road days, but you really can't complain about this truck.  Great overall buy.  I would recommend to anyone without the kids who wants their first truck.  I am nineteen years old, and I will have a hard time giving it up......
Thanks for reading....
