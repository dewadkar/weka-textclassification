            <b>Safety Counts For Me</b><i>The 2001 Toyota Sienna is equpped with all the standard features including driver and passenger airbags and front seat side impact airbags.  If yours does not have, you can pick this option</i>

When our 1999 Toyota Corolla got t-boned by an apparently drunk taxi cab, we became a one-car family for two days. (Please read my review of the Corolla's features that saved their lives!).  

So I had to deal with the heavy cast that was placed around my son's legs and hips.  After a few days, I realized it would be better to rent a van until our insurance company gets all the paperwork completed.  We rented a 2000 Toyota Sienna.  It made a whole world of differences in our handling of our son's cast.  Suddenly, we did not have to bend down low to fix his leg and buckle him up.  The 2001 is somewhat an updated version of the 2000 Toyota Sienna. 

<b>Experience The 2001 Sienna</b>
<i>I test-drove the 2001 Toyota Sienna for you</i>

Having driven the 2000 Sienna, I became curious about what the 2001 would all about.  So I made an appointment with a friend of mine who is working at a local dealership.  After work, I dropped by for my test-drive.  What I thought would take about 45 or 50 minutes ended up taking more than 2 hours.  I just could not get out of the city.  Yet, my goal remained the foothills of Yosemite.  With the current rolling blackouts, the traffic lights were not working.  I ended up sitting in traffic for what looked like an eternity.

<b>The drive on the way out</b>

Just as I expected it, it was smooth.  The 2001 Sienna drives like a luxury car.  There is practically no noise.  As I was driving past the local farms and some dilapidated old farmhouses, I was mostly focusing on the interior.  Suddenly, memories of the times when my son had to be carefully placed in the middle seat started invading my mind.  The 2001 XLE Sienna comes equipped with driver and passenger airbags and side-impact airbags.

The 2001 Toyota Sienna is a great vehicle for any family with teenagers.  As long as it's safe, they can get off either sides.  As a parent, I know how impatient some teens may be at times.  The 2001 Toyota Sienna solves this problem.  The passenger-side sliding door can be easily opened.  Just push the middle seat forward to make space.  If it's safe to get off on the left side, the driver's side-sliding door is very accessible.  What I like with it is that it has a lock system that automatically locks it after a few seconds.  My tester (the XLE) was also equipped with a moonroof.
