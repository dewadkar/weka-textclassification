            What a car! I love it! 

Two of my friends own it and always have big grins on their face when they drive it. I won't talk as much about the engine specs or car's numbers in this review. I'm sure you can easily find them at any major automotive website. Instead, I will talk about the thrill of driving this car and the things I have noticed.

THE ENGINE
------------
A 2.0 litre engine. South of 6000 before the VTEC cross over point when the aggressive cams kick in, this car performs like a Honda. Reliable. Good on gas. Yay.

Once you blast past 6000 RPM, you immediately hear a higher tone as if the car has just woken up. Before you know it, the car is nearing the 9000 redline and you shift to another gear. You have to drive it like you hate it to get everything out of this car. The engine sounds great!

Speaking of the shifter, I love it. It's already comparable to aftermarket short-shifters and feels like a feather. Honda has always made great shifters; for example the new Acura RSX Type-S's shifter is amazing!

Be warned, a lot of noise comes from this engine! It's a performance machine, don't let the leather seats fool you!

INTERIOR
----------
A very spartan interior made for the driver that feels very small. There are no bells and whistles inside, it is all about the driver, the car and the road. 

If you are a passenger, don't complain about the seating or the hump that is in the way of your left leg. Just enjoy the ride. 

The S2000 versions I tested both had the OEM hardtop and even though the rear view window isn't that big it is enough to see out off. 

The radio is horrible. It's the same one Honda equips in it's economical Civics! Oh well, this is a performance machine with a 50/50 weight balance (2002 models are 48/50 or so due to rear glass window and other changes I hear) so no major complaints.

The leather seats are very supportive. I read somewhere they are made by Recaro but this is not confirmed. They come in black and red in 2000-2001 models. 2002 models come in black, or full red/blue interiors (ick).

EXTERIOR
-----------
The car looks simple and with the long hood, flows very well. A classical design that will look great for years. 

The car comes with great HID lights unlike the ones found on the Acura TL which I do not like. Rear lights on this car look great, very aggressive. 

Options for this car include the OEM front lip which I recommend. It adds subtle style. Do not get the OEM sideskirt mouldings, they are stapled onto the car and stick out too much. The spoiler I would not recommend either because it takes away from the 'flow' the car has. 

The hardtop option is also recommend but somewhat pricey. There are aftermarket ones including one by Mugen that will stand out. 

2000 and 2001 models come with a plastic window in the canvas softtop. It's horrible! You have to take care of it or it will degrade in no time. Honda listened to the complaints and the 2002+ models come with a glass window.


PERFORMANCE
-------------
Interested in how this car does from a stop-go stoplight performance? Drivers with great skill can take this car from 0-60 in 13.8-13.9 seconds quartermile. Average drivers like myself will mostly be in the 14.3-14.5 range. This car is very hard to launch because you need to launch it at around 6000 rpm. It has a limited slip and is RWD, but it is still very hard because of the long rev range. Still enjoyable! The 0-60 time ranges from mid-high fives to six seconds depending on driver skill.

On the track, this car simply dominates others in the same litre class. When this car is in VTEC range (and it often is after shifts), it zooms. It feels light, yet not too light. Very balanced like a Miata on steroids. The S2000 can keep up with the Porsche Boxster S on the track if drivers are of equal skill. Spectacular!

Off the track, this car is a little hard to control in bad weather because of the RWD and average stock tires. I have heard of drivers spinning out very often so be careful. I would recommend winter tires in the winter seasons.

The top speed of this car is around 145-150 mph.

As a daily driver the 6-gear transmission of this car has enough range for a comfortable driver but you may find yourself shifting a little more than often in rushhour traffic. 

Passing cars is too easy.

DAILY DRIVING
----------------
Both versions I drove were Spa Yellow with hardtops so I caught a lot of attention. Add to the fact they were modified, just about everyone looked.

CONCLUSION
-------------
If you are living in the United States, I recommend you get the pearl white version with red leather seats. If you are looking at a 2002 model, do not get the full red/blue interiors. It will not look very good in a few years and many enthusists are already complaining about it.

Go out and test this car! They are becoming more common (well at least here in Canada) and dealers don't treat them as priceless posessions anymore.

If you end up purchasing it, please email me! I would love to know I helped in a very little way expand Honda's range of performance machines!

You can haggle with the dealer and get it 1-2k below MSRP. I have heard of owners purchasing them for 30k or so.
