            I've had my A6 4.2 since October of 2000. It replaced a Mercedes 300E. I still love it. It's beautiful inside and out. The ride is smooth and the engine is incredibly powerful. The Quattro works great here during our Wisconsin winters, although this year I think I'll install show tires.

The car has the best stereo system and best climate control of any car I've ever had. The trunk is roomy, and the rear seat holds two adults in relative comfort. Visibility is excellent. Air bags and safety systems are excellent.

This is the first car I've ever had that has not had a single rattle or squeak that needed to be fixed. So far, the only repairs that have been needed, have been: 1- a piece of chrome corroded when the winter salt hit it; 2-A wire near the trunk shorted out and disabled the locks; 3-Something went haywire with my dashboard display, and they had to replace the instrument cluster. All of these things were easily and quickly fixed by my Audi dealer.

I still marvel at this car after almost 2 years. If you want all wheel drive, you can't find a better sport luxury car.
