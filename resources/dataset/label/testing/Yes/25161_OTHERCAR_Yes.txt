            The lease was expired on my sports car this Winter. I was not looking forward to getting a more &quot;grown-up&quot; automobile, but the time had come. I needed a four door car. I have owned Mazdas in the past, so it made sense for me to test drive the Protege. I fell in love.
I'm a fairly small person, but the car is roomy and very well designed. I leased a 2000 Mazda Protege DX in silver (with a spoiler). All of the driver's controls (heat/AC, Cruise, Wipers, Lights...) are easily accessible and in a logical place. Those of you who have test driven cars with poorly designed dashboards know what I'm talking about.
In addition, I learned from our dealer that the Protege is rated the safest car in it's class. Now, I'm no auto expert, but it's certainly something to consider.
Trunk space was another concern. I am a weekend garage sale lover, so I needed the room in the trunk. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the back seat folds down (easily) to increase trunk space.
The best part about the Protege is that it's fun to drive. So, I compromised. I was able to find a safe, affordable family car that doesn't remind me of my father's Lincoln. :)
The Protege is a versatile car. I think it's a great buy for a student who wants a new car on a tight budget, a family just starting out (that's me) or anyone who is looking for a great value for the money.<br><br>
