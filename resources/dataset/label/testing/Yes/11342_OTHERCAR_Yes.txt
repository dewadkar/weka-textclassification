            My wife and I had to replace our ailing 1994 Ford Aerostar recently.  We shopped around and settled on a Ford Windstar or a Dodge Grand Caravan.  After bouncing around dealerships in the area, we drove a rental returned Grand Caravan LE with 20K miles.  It had lots of room for our three kids and extra space in the back for the extra gear a family always hauls.  There are enough cup holders, (8), for a small army.  Chrysler even has two cup holders that slide out from underneath the middle seat.  Everything on the dash is easy to reach.  The dual climate control in the front comes in handy since my wife and I rarely want the same temperature.  It also has a rear heater/ac.  The front console has lots of room for glasses, tapes or cd's, and anything else.  There are a lot of little extras like a net that strings between the two front bucket seats to hold items and the hangers from the back of the back seat to hold plastic grocery bags.  As a &quot;Car-guy&quot;, I love the raw power of the large 3.8 liter engine.  It provides enough torque to smoke the tires should I feel the &quot;Need For Speed&quot;.  It obviously will tow a small trailer well.  As a Father, I like the extra sliding door.  Now that we have it, I wonder how we ever got along without it.  It is very convenient, especially with young kids and car seats.  We recently drove late at night to California and stopped at a rest area for an early morning nap.  The two rear seats fold down enough for the kids to get a good sleep, yet not be on top of each other.  I wish the middle seat folded down all the way though, because then it would fold down into one large bed in the back.

Now, let's talk about the things that make it a 9 rather than a 10.  First off the mileage is poor.  18 miles per gallon in the city and 22 on the highway is inexcusable in this day and age.  Second the car corners like a truck.  In hard cornering one has to fight it to keep in between the lines.  Either anti-roll bars or stiffer suspension is called for.  If I had a load cornering would be a chore.  In earlier models I owned, cornering was actually one of the strong points.  

In conclusion, for the money the car is a good value.  We have had it for 2 months and other than as noted above, it doesn't disappoint us.  It is a great rig for the family!    <br><br>
