            After a lot of lengthy research I ended up chosing the Flame Red Durango that I now drive.  And to be honest with you I don't regret one bit of it.

I have purchased new vehicles in the past and have always had one or two complaints and actually have regretted the purchase.  With my Durango I fall in love all over a again every day I drive it to work.It handles like a dream and has ample ammounts of power to tow almost anything. It has a very smooth ride even when you are off the pavement.  Excellent control in adverse conditions such as snow and ice.  I enjoy the options in the 4-Wheel drive as well.  This allows me to &quot;dial in&quot; my needed traction control.

   I opted for the 5.9L so I was able to tow a boat or snowmobiles.  Believe me this thing has power.  I owned a 5.0 95 Mustang prior to this SUV and I am not missing out on any power at all.


I think one of the best features of the Durango is its interior.  Extremely roomy and actually quite luxurious (I opted for leather seating).  The comfort of the ride is superb.  I do travel long distances often and my body never really gets fatigued in my Durango like it does in my moms Explorer.  I have noticed how much better things are built in the Durango V.S. the Explorer, all the way down to the door handles.  i would have to say Dodge did not leave any stone unturned when they put the Durango out on the market.  It is rough and rugged enough to go offroad and handle adverse weather, yet very sleek and elegant enough to take you to your favourite Opera.

Not only does the Durango look good, it is so durable.  I have been rear ended count this &quot;3&quot; times within the year I have owned my Durango.  Not once have I had to take it in for any body work though.  I can't say that about the cars that have hit me, for instance the little Maxima that hit me looks as though she wrapped her front bumper around a telephone pole.  Needless to say I feel very safe in my Durango and have no problems with hauling my family around in it!

Overall I have to say that the Durango is certainly more bang for your buck.  You look at all the other SUV's on the market and none can compare with the Durango as far as options and price is concerned. Not to mention overall power and performance. And to top it all off, you look good driving it!<br><br>
