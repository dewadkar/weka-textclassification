            I purchased my 1995 626 ES in mid-July. It only had 32k miles on it, and it was in great shape, looking just a shade from brand-new. I purchased the car because of its engine (2.5l V6) and its luxury features. The car comes standard with leather seats, moonroof, alarm system, ABS, dual airbags, etc. I believe the only option on the 1995 626 ES was the 5-speed manual transmission, with which my car was unfortunately not equipped. Such are the perils of buying used cars. The price, however, was extremely attractive. I did plenty of research before I purchased the car, and I found Mazda 626's to be about $2000-2500 less than comparably equipped autos from Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.

Since purchasing the car, I have noticed a few quirks. The wheels needed alignment, and the tires needed rotated and balanced. I had the work done, and I still notice what I consider to be excessive (for this type of car) road and suspension noise. The tires are low profile ($$$), and the suspension is tuned a little on the performance side, but they shouldn't be quite so boisterous. Overall, they give the car a somewhat schizophrenic personality of luxury and performance. It is not always unpleasant, but it can be obtrusive. One downside is somewhat excessive body roll during cornering. Considering the suspension, it should stay in place a little better.

The engine is sweet. There is plenty of power on tap, but the car does not feel overpowered. The mileage is good (20 city/28 or so highway), and the engine is silky smooth (perhaps accentuating the road noise by being so quiet). Speeding tickets are the only downside here. I've already received a speeding ticket after owning the car only a few months. It was my first in seven years. Speaking of tickets, the brakes feel quite good. Perhaps I should use them a little more.

Comparing the driving experience with the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry, the 626 feels very sporty. It should, too. It's lighter than both the Accord and the Camry, and I've already mentioned the motor. The road noise and suspension also both add to the sporty feel.

The fit and finish of the exterior seems good, though perhaps not quite on par with Honda or Toyota. Ditto with some of the interior plastics. Good, but not great.

Overall, this is a solid, luxurious and sporty car at a slightly discount price. I would recommend it to someone else, and I would consider buying another one. It's a good car for those who can find better ways to use the $2500 they'll save by buying the 626 instead of an Accord or Camry.<br><br>
