            I have a 2.4l,four cylinder and it flies.It is comfortable and the seats are roomy and taking a nap(if  you are not driving),is very comfortable.It has a 4 speed automatic transaxle,comes with driver and front passenger air bags.Airconditioning that will freeze you,and models with dual or single sliding compartment doors,and rear liftgate.It comes in a host of interior desighns and carpet and seating colors and fabric.It has a 20 gallon fuel tank that they say gives you around 24 miles to the gallon.I am getting about 400 to 425 miles to the tank.The ride is so smooth and quiet you almost wander if the engine is running and if you are moving.It seats 7 people with comfort and room to spare.It has plenty of leg room.The vehicle has more storage compartments that I dreamed of.When you open the rear liftgate there are hooks to hang your grocery bags(plastic) on.You have a large storage area for luggage and the seats are removable.It has two power outlest for accessories one in the front and one in the rear when you open the liftgate.The sound system is fantastic and come with cassette,Cd optional.The wipers are variable speed for any occassion.It has beverage holders all over the place.It also has three-zone air controllers for the comfort of passengers.For those who have leg problems or back problems this vehicle is very easy to get in and out of.The instument panel has all the gauges and warning lights that are easy to see.You can get the Caravan with power doors and windows or manual controls.They start at around $17,000.00 and up.They also have a 7 year 100 thiusand mile warranty.So far I am completely satisfied.
