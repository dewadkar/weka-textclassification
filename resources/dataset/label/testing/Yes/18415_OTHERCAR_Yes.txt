            The reason I bought this camera I was getting ready for vacation and I have been looking at all kinds of digital cameras and I knew Hewlett-Packard makes great product. I wanted to take photos on my vacation so instead of keep buying those 1 time usage cameras that you buy at the store then take back in  to get the photos done and pay again. I got smart and bought this camera on my Birthday for me to save money and it sure has saved me a lot of money. Because all I have to do now is hook it up to my computer and download the photos and magic it&#146s the photos are there so I don&#146t have to wait for the photos to come back from the store.
