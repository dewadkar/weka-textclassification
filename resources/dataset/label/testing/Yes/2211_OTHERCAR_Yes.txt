                  This is an excellent car.  I have had mine for 2 months and it runs great.  The looks of this car are very conservative, but when you drive it you will notice that it's looks can be deceiving. It is a very quick and nimble automobile perfect for city driving and yet classy enough in looks to drive to a special occasion. The large headlights look a little awkward at first but they are very bright and Useful. The interior is flawless.  All gauges are easy to read and are not blocked by the steering wheel. The black cloth seats are very comfortable. Also, the interior space is suitable for tall drivers.  The large windshield makes the entire road very viewable.  It comes with a high power CD player stereo system with something called acoustic feedback system.  Small microphones in the rear speakers measure any distortion from the sound system and adjust the stereo output accordingly.  The power plant is a 4 cylinder, 2.2 liter, 200 horsepower vtec engine.  Power steering, locks, windows, moonroof, mirrors, ABS brakes are standard.  It's 16 inch alloy wheels and low profile V speed rated tires make handling excellent. And don't worry about having to have this car repaired often.  It is extremely reliable. This car is fun to drive.<br><br>
