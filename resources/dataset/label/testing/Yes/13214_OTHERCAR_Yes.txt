            I did a lot of research before buying my first digital camera and ended up choosing the Canon A70.  I already had a 35mm Canon and love it so I trusted the name.  It was also a great price for all the features and 3.2MegaPixels.  So I crossed my fingers and gave the A70 a shot.  I was not at all disappointed.  It has many options, takes excellent, clear pictures, it's easy to use, it's just great!  You can chose size and quality and there are options for close shot, far shots, moving shots, and lots of options that I haven't figured out what they are for yet.  But if you want, it's easy just to use "auto" and not worry about it at all.  The only problem I have, and keep in mind i'm quite the novice at photography, is that sometimes it seems to focus on something near the camera when I actually am trying to take of something in the distance.  I'm sure there is a way around that problem, i just haven't looked that up yet.  Speaking of which, the camera comes with manuals and photo software.  Haven't delved into them yet but they seem good at first glance.  Camera does have a neat panoramic option.  you basically take several pictures from right to left and with the software you can create one long picture out of them.  Very cool!  As far as negatives, the only I can think of is that I tend to get red-eye a little more often then I'd like, and it absolutely eats batteries.  Takes AA so if you get this camera, get some rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  You'll save tons of money.
