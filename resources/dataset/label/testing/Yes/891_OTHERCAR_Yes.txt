            I recently purchased this digital camera to take on my honeymoon.  I have never been what you'd call a "shutter bug," but I love this camera so much I took tons of pictures, and because I could review every picture I took, I didn't have to wait until we returned from our trip to realize the picture of the beautiful sunset was actually of someone's foot.  I was also able to get shots of the two of us (via the remote) without having to always ask someone to take our picture.  I have pictures of us standing on the beach at sunset, and people are shocked when I tell them we took the picture.  I can't say enough good things about this camera.  I absolutely love it!  To be fair to new purchasers, however, I should point out a couple of cons.  The first is the 8 MB memory card.  You simply have to purchase a card with more memory.  I absolutely recommend the rechargeable batteries and charger.  All digital cameras eat through them, especially when using the LCD, but mine seemed to last a couple of days before I needed to change them.  The second is the panoramic function.  This function is not as easy to use on this camera as others I've seen, such as the Canon, as you kind of have to guess where the last picture ended to determine where to the joining picture should begin.  Overall, though, I think this is an excellent camera.
