            This is for all of you who would like a real world review of the New Beetle.  I bought my dark blue 1999 NB in July of 1999 with 6 miles on the odo.  GLS with auto, sunroof and tan leatherette (read vinyl).  Added only mudflaps.

It has been almost two years and over 25,000 miles and this is my report.  First and foremost, this car is still the most fun car I have ever owned.  I still get beeps and waves on the road, not to mention the countless kids who point and gesture excitedly to their friends and family when they see me drive by.

There has been quite a few reviews written in other (less reliable) places which have raised issues of durability and reliability over the long haul.  Let me put those concerns to rest.  Over the course of 25,000 miles, I have had absolutely nothing break or malfunction.  The car is still as tight and rattle free as the day I bought it, and the drive train has been bullet-proof.  I've kept to the factory maintenance schedule (free for the first 2 yrs - 24K miles) and have changed the oil every 3K miles.  The leatherette has been a godsend for its easy cleanup and durability (I have two kids).  While its no minivan, there is a surprising amount of room for my family of four.  We've taken 3 and 4 hours trips to the shore in great comfort.

I have recorded around 30 mpg on the highway, with between 26 and 27 in mixed driving (60/40 highway/city).  

The interior has remained in great shape -- no loose or broken trim pieces as past VWs have been prone to shed.  My only gripes are the ridiculously small and poorly placed side view mirrors (which were fixed in 2001) and the small almost useless sun visors (which were not fixed).  The deep dashboard takes some getting used to, but it is relatively non-reflective and actually makes the interior seem much larger that it is (although it is still pretty big).

I am 6'2" and I fit comfortably behind the telescoping and tilting wheel.  My wife is slightly less than five feet and she can also find a comfortable driving position.  

Thankfully, we have never been in an accident in this car, but I am confident that should it happen, the car will protect us with its side and dual front airbags.  The NB was rated the safest car in its class in crash tests.

I usually keep my cars for about three years, but this one's a keeper.  It has proven itself to be a reliable and economical car with lots of character.  The appeal is much more than skin deep.  You can't go wrong with the New Beetle!
