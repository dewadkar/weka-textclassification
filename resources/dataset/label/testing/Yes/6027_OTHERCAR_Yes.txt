            When my husband and I decided to buy a car, we knew that a late model used car would fit best into our budget.  We narrowed down our search for a compact/subcompact and drove a handful of cars.  After we drove the Saturn L200, we didn't drive anything else -- our decision was made. We wanted a Saturn, either an L100 SE or an L200. We ended up buying a 2002 L200 with 20,000 miles (on the high side, but the price made up for that).  I do recommend the L200 over the L100 SE -- they are <b>almost</b> identical, but there are some subtle comfort differences (for example, the center console arm rest and power mirrors), and the L200 has a higher resale value.  However, the L100 SE is a little cheaper to insure. (Although overall, I was pleased with how economical it is to insure this car.)

One thing I was quite concerned about while we were shopping for our car was the difference I would feel going from the V-6 Chrysler LeBaron that I was driving to the 4 cylinder car we decided we wanted.  I live in a rural area, we drive a lot, and fuel economy was an issue for us.  So, we wanted a 4 cylinder, but I was afraid that I would notice the loss of power.  When I drove a "program" Ford Focus, I did notice that loss of power.  I felt a drag when the car shifted from first to second gear, and I didn't feel like I had a lot of "get up and go."  I have not had this experience with my Saturn.  I do notice that it dogs just a little when climbing hills, however, I will trade this for the average 29 mpg that I am getting with it any day.  The Saturn L200 I bought has a 2.2 litre engine, (the Focus was 1.9) and with the exception of hill climbing, has all the power I could want -- passing on the highway is no problem, I simply press on the accelerator and the car shifts up into what my husband calls "passing gear" and we sail comfortably around the car in front of us.  The handling is very nice, the steering is responsive and tight, and the turning radius is noticeably smaller than what I am used to.  

 Another feature on this car that has been useful for us is the traction control.  I have never had any experience with this before, and it's been such a great option.  Since we live in a rural area in the midwest, snow is an issue for us.  Even moreso of an issue than the snow is the cinders that are laid on the roadways to improve traction on slick roadways.  These cinders are quite helpful when there is actually snow or ice on the roads, but often remain behind in copious quantities once the snow and ice has disappeared.  This can be hazardous when stopping and starting or turning on country roads.   The first time I drove a Saturn L200, I took it on a route that covered some of the more bumpy country roads to see how it would handle.  I pulled to a stop at an intersection where cinders had built up, and hit the accelerator pretty hard when I took off.  I felt the passenger side front tire slip for just a fraction of a second -- then the traction control light came on and the tire gripped the roadway and off we went!  We have since had the traction control kick on in icy circumstances, with similar results.  This is invaluable for anyone who has to drive in winter conditions.  Thusfar, we haven't "tested" it on wet roadways, but I imagine that it would perform in just the same manner.  I do notice some wind noise at higher speeds, but it's a dramatic decrease from the Ford Focus or Dodge Neon.

The interior of the car is comfortable for our little family.  So far, I've had no more than four people in the car, but I'm sure it would seat five comfortably.  Also, I have a friend who has severe arthritis in both knees, and as a result, has difficulty walking and maneuvering comfortably (getting in and out of vehicles can be an issue for her).  She had no problem getting into and out of my Saturn.   I find it quite comfortable to drive.  I notice that in the Focus that I drove, I had to keep my foot at an uncomfortable angle to keep control of the accelerator.  There is no such issue with this Saturn.  There's plenty of leg room in the front (and I'm a reasonably tall 5'8") and still enough room in the back as well.  When we drove the Focus, my 11 year old son complained that he had to put his feet UNDER the driver's seat in order to stretch his legs comfortably.  I cannot imagine how cramped it might have been for an adult back there. 

The interior is pretty "generic".  It's attractive, but there's nothing to terribly different about it than other cars of it's class.  I do like the window controls on the center console.  I've read other reviews where people found them awkward or uncomfortable, I rather like where they are  -- It's easier for me to find the appropriate button for the window I want to roll down than if the controls were on the driver's side door.  The gauges are nice and easy to read, I like the fact that it has a tachometer (this car was the only one that we drove that had one.  I would have missed it if we had bought a different car). The radio and CD player have pretty good sound, my son notices that he can hear the radio better in the back seat than in our previous car.   (This was always a bit of an issue for him!)  When reclining the front seats, once you want to return them to an upright position, they snap back into place VERY quickly with quite a bit of force.  You want to be aware of that, and use your weight to counteract the strength of the mechanism -- it can be alarming.    Either the running lights or headlights are always on.  There's a sensor in the dash that automatically turns on the headlights when it is dark or rainy.  I've had no problems with the sensitivity of this -- my headlights come on at appropriate times.  However, I would like the option to turn the running lights or headlights completely off -- I often pull into our driveway after dark when my husband is sleeping -- our bedroom window is at the end of the driveway, so as a consideration, I turn off my headlights just as I pull in, to keep the blinding flash out of the bedroom -- I can't do this with my Saturn, I wish I could.  The automatically locking doors don't unlock until you pull the key out of the ignition.  Personally, I find this hard to get used to.

All in all, I love my Saturn.  It's a sophisticated looking car -- not too flashy, but stylish.  It handles WONDERFULLY and the ride is as comfortable and smooth as can be expected for a car of it's class.  The engine compartment is roomy -- a must for my husband who will most likely do the work and maintenance on the car after the warranty expires.  The trunk space is deceptively LARGE, which is a bonus. The few things that I do have issues with are minor, and probably could be chalked up to personal preference rather than any type of deficiency in the car itself.  I don't think I could have bought a different car and been this satisfied over all.

One last note about Saturn dealerships.  Unfortunately, I didn't buy my car from our Saturn dealership.  I found a car on a competitor's lot that was identical to the one I feel in love with at the dealership, and my husband was able to haggle the price down enough to make it far more profitable for us to buy from them (a task that I am glad I did not have to undertake).   However, once I had decided which car I wanted, I spent quite a bit of time on the phone to Saturn dealerships in the area, as well as with a salesman at our local Saturn dealership, and let me tell you, they <b>are</b> a different breed altogether.  Due to the "no-haggle" pricing and the fact that their salesmen work on salary, there's not that feeling of vultures descending upon you when you step onto a Saturn lot. The salesmen are laid-back and relaxed, and give you time to examine the cars on the lot before rushing out to try and sell you a car. The salesman I dealt with was VERY knowledgeable about the cars, and very pleasant to deal with.  I regret that I was unable to buy my car from him. I have registered my car with Saturn, and, in the event that it needs it, will be taking my car to my Saturn dealership for service, as opposed to taking it back to the lot I purchased it from.  I'm definitely sold on the Saturn experience, and I think I'll be a Saturn driver as long as I can still drive.
