            I bought my blue Rav4 in July of 1997. It has all wheel drive all the time, I never worry about spinning in the gravel or snow. My husband is 6 ft. and is very comfortable driving it, we have taken it on several long trips. The 4 cylinder engine has plenty of power but at the same time is great on gas. I can fit almost anything in the back with the seats down.  We even put a fully assembled propane BBQ without the lid in the back. Also my 65lb Yellow Lab loves to ride in it. Because it's a Toyota I expect to get at least 250,000 miles from it. I think it's a great car for women, it's small but it gives you the feeling of independence. The price was right for me, if I had the money I would have bought a Toyota   4 Runner. But they were at least $30,000 and the Rav4 was around $22,000. And now with gas as high as it is I think it was the right decision. Oh and you would be surprised at how high it sits off the ground, I can see over most sedans. Most of the men I know think it's a womens car and would never own one. <br><br>
