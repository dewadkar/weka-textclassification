            <b>Recently my family went searching for a new car. We decided on the Pontiac Grand Am. I would have to say it was one of the best decisions we have made in our lives. The car drives smooth, uses very little gas and is an overall comfortable car to drive in. 

1. Comfort- 9 This car surely is as comfortable as they come. It does not bounce up and down like some cars, giving you headaches. The seats are very comfortable, making the ride enjoyable. Also you don't have to deal with the annoying revving of the engine. The car is very quiet, making almost no noise. Most cars have extremely bright lights, for the clock which strain your eyes. Pontiac changed all that by having orange lights which are easier to look at. The only drawback would be the cars small back seats, cramping up your legs and giving you no room to stretch. 

2. Safety- 7 As with all small cars, you are at more risk to be injured in an accident that big trucks and 4 wheel drive cars. With great pickup, its easy to get out of tight jams. With crazy drivers in our college town, our family has been able to avoid four near accidents in the past year. In the occasion that a crazy driver comes at you and you just can't avoid an accident. The Pontiac comes with front air bags. The Pontiac isn't just safe when you driving. It has a automatic car locking system so if you forget to lock the car door, u won't have to worry about people just walking right in. The setback from that is that you may lock your keys in the car. It has an alarm system on the car keys where you can trigger the alarm if you are in trouble. 

Special Features- 8 Another safety feature this button in the truck you can push. Stick your valued property in the truck and it prevents anybody from just pushing the trunk open button if they break into your car. With this function, you need to open the car door with a key. Most cars have sound systems that aren't anything special. They play music, but the sound is anything but full. Well the Pontiac went all out, with one of the best sound systems around. You can take the bass and go from nearly no bass to bass that shakes your car. Some cars only have tape players. The Grand Am has a C.D player and a cassette player. All this adds more to the excellent driving experience. 

Gas Mileage- 9 This car gets the most out of the gas you put into it. Our family has found it gets around 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 gallons on the highway. If that's what you mainly look for in a car with the rising gas prices these days, this could be an option but i would really recommend Honda cars for that. 

Overall this is a great car for the cost and i think that everybody should at least look into, or rent this car.<b>
