            The Monte Carlo is available in two styles, the LS and the SS. This review will be on the sporty looking SS model, two-door coupe. This car was made for the NASCAR fan in mind.

The SS has a powerful V-6 with 200 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque. It is a 3.8 Liter V-6 with Fuel Induction SFI known as the 3800 Series II. Mileage is rated at 20 miles per gallon for the city and 30 miles per gallon for the highway. This car will move and if you keep your foot in the gas throttle, the mileage will go down. Driving it normal I did get 19.7 MPG in the city and 31.2 MPG on the highway. Standard is an automatic transmission 4-Speed with Overdrive.

The trunk is pretty roomy with 15.8 cubic feet of cargo space, it has a17-gallon fuel tank and 4-wheel ABS disc brakes & anti lock assist with full functional traction control.

<b> Standard Features </b>
The Monte Carlo SS is loaded with standard features, here are some of them.

Dual front air bags and a driver's side impact air bag.
Dual heated power mirrors.
Six-Way power driver's seat adjuster.
A remote keyless entry with a theft deterrent system.
Daytime running lamps and fog lamps.
Am & Fm stereo cassette (CD available extra)
Cruise control
Rear window defogger
Radio controls built in the steering wheel.
Dual zone air conditioning
And much more
   
<b> OnStar </b>
OnStar is standard in the SS and is free for one year, after that you will have to subscribe with them. 

Now you can see where you are and where you want to go, this is very handy if you travel a lot. One feature that I like with OnStar is if you lock your keys in your car all you have to do is call them and they will unlock it on the spot through their satellite. 

You can also do things when traveling like finding the nearest restaurant, the nearest hotel and roadside assistance almost anywhere.

<b>Price</b>
The base price for the Monte Carlo SS is $ 22400.00 without the destination charge. Compare this with the base price of the LS model of  $19570.00 it is $2830.00 more. It is worth the extra to me, it is so much nicer.

For $2100.00 they offer a Sport Appearance Package that includes Full Ground Effects with a special spoiler, 16" aluminum wheels and stainless steel dual exhaust tips. This package really sets it off and is worth the extra $2100.00.

 <b>Overall</b>
The ride is smooth and comfortable with the independent suspension. It is rather quiet inside shutting out a lot of the outside noises.

It is very comfortable sitting in it and all the controls are within easy reach with the easy to read gauges. 

The interior is well light with plenty of lights. When you use your keyless entry to lock it, the interior light will stay on for a little while and slowly start dimming down until it is shut off. You never have to turn your headlights on and off again, the car does it for you, there is a switch if you wanted to use the headlights manually.

This SS has the Am & Fm CD player and it sounded great.
                                                 
The Monte Carlo SS warranty is 3 years or 36,000 miles bumper to bumper with the same for 24-hr Roadside Assistance. Rust through warranty is six years or 100,000 miles. 

I highly recommend the 2001 Monte Carlo SS.
