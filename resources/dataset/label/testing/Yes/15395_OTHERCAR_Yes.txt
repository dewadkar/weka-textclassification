            I absolutly adore the Mavica FD-83 digital camera.  This camera has lots of options that make using the camera both fun and easy.  The auto focus works well and allows the photographer to not worry about focusing.  The big picture screen lets the photographer and those around see a clear picture of what will appear when the photograph is taken.  Plus there are numerous features, such as black and while, solar, and negative picture effects.  I also enjoy being able to take a short movie with this camera.  The pictures are easy and quick to view after you have taken them, and if you are not happy with the pictures you can easily erase them on the spot.  After one disk is full, just pop in the next and start taking pictures again.  This camera is great for vacations, memorable moments and everyday fun.  And it is so easy to learn to use.  If only it didn't cost so much...<br><br>
