            We recently bought a 1998 Contour.  It was the first and the twentieth car we looked at.

After several weeks of comparing the Contour to other cars, we ended up with this great vehicle.

The Contour looks great, drives great, and handles like a gem.  If you're looking for a good, solid 4 door sedan, seriously consider a Contour.

The mileage isn't the best, but it holds up to other comparable models.

The ride is smooth, acceleration is good (but not great.  It's not a sports car though, so we don't care if we can't go 0 to 60 in 7 seconds).

There have been three recalls since we bought this car.  At first I was a little concerned about this.  However, I figure there are recalls because the bugs are getting worked out.  The water pump also went out.  But we're still under warranty, so it didn't cost anything.

This is the first car we've had power locks and windows on.  My wife didn't really want them, but buying used, we didn't have much choice.  Now she loves the convenience.

I'd say, all in all, we like the feel of the car.  The seats are wide and comfortable.  There's even good leg room in the back seat.  

If you care much about the little things, you'll like the two cup holders in the front and one in the back, for rear seat passengers.  There's a coin cup built into the dash and for once, a car manufacturer put it in a convenient place.

If you're looking for a good solid, nice looking sedan, look into the Contour.  If you're single and looking for something more sporty, look for something else.<br><br>
