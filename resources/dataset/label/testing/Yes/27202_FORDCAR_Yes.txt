            Ford really nailed their target market with this car. My wife and I are extremely pleased with this car.

When I went looking for cars after my ex-car died I expected the only cars in my price range would be super tiny and have no features, then I went to the Ford dealership. The Focus has lots of features I didn't expect to be able to afford such as CD audio, cruise, 16'' alloy wheels and security system. The 2.0L Zetec engine with 5-speed manual transmission has great pickup for a small car, sure to get you out of the way of any giant SUV drivers. Mileage is great, especially on the highway.

The interior is very comfortable with plenty of space in the front. The rear seat is large enough for an adult, but I do not think it would be comfortable for long trips. The rear seats fold down providing plenty of cargo space. The drivers seat includes forward/backward adjustment AND vertical adjustment. I have taken the car on several trips of at least 1.5 hours and do not tire of the seats. The ride is also much quieter than I would have expected from a non-luxury car.

The CD stereo sounds great and has a detachable face to help deter theft. Environmental controls are exactly how I like them with an independent A/C and Re-circulate button. All of the controls can be easily reached without a stretch. There is also a hatch release button on the dash. 

The headlamps are nice, the brights are REALLY illuminate the road and even both sides - great if you ever drive on country roads. Fog lamps are also included. Another nice feature is the rear widow wiper, washer and defrost.

Gauges are large and well illuminated. A tachometer is included. The leather wrapped steering wheel is tilt AND telescoping. Here is the only Con I can think of with the car - the cruise control buttons on the steering wheel are not illuminated. The buttons are textured though so it is not that hard to find them.

The exterior of the car has a look that I really like. The 16'' alloy wheels with low profile tires are really nice looking.

Fuel consumption is generally quite low. I usually drive conservatively but don't hesitate to get on it when needed. I have gotten greater than 30 mpg every fill up so far.
