            I wanted to play with the &quot;big boys&quot; but most SUVs were totally out of my price range.  I was tired of sitting on the ground in my sedan, tired of everyone else's high lights blinding me in my side mirrors, etc.  I also didn't want the expensive gas costs for a large SUV.  Not only is the Sportage a very accessible purchase, it will not disappoint.  Seating is more than generous (I'm a big person) and visibility is incredible both from the front and rear seats.  The ride is smooth and very un-truck-like.  The engine is quiet and the controls are very nicely placed.  &quot;Standard&quot; items on the Kia include power windows and door locks, important safety features that I do not consider options and neither does Kia.  The roll bars, steel side beams and (get this) KNEE AIR BAGS really clinched the deal for me.  The car is very nice looking and is not any smaller than the new SUVs from Lexus and Mercedes.  I have not experienced any rolling problems, but I am a pretty &quot;gentle&quot; driver.  My 15 year old son thinks this car is too cool and even my husband thinks it's great.  <br><br>
