            Our Buick 2001 will be two years old in July 2003, we bought the car brand new.  We only had a few cars to pick from the lot, we choose the Gold color as our previous Buick was white and I wanted some color.

Our Buick is a 6-cycliner engine, four door, am/fm, cassette and CD player. We have cloth seats, the interior color is a gold/beige. Our locks and windows and driver's seat are all power. To unlock the trunk you have a button in your glove box.  We were really limited with our pick with the Gold Century, not just due to the color but we wanted On-Star.

The top features in our car are the power adjustable driver's seat, On-Star and Problem Alerts. The stereo concert sound is powerful and the air conditioning is excellent, with driver and passenger adjustable controls. With the air conditioning on low we are definitely chilled.

Our Buick has not needed any repairs, only maintenance such as oil changes and mileage maintenance. We have almost 30,000 miles.

Since I am disabled with chronic pain in my back and legs the Driver's seat has been a real plus and I can adjust the seat to perfection. There is a real difference when I sit in the passenger seat, which only moves forward and backwards and the back goes up or down. I can only drive for a  short time in the passenger seat.

The On-Star I just cannot do without, for $199.00 a year, the first year paid by General Motors, we were short on funds and there is no way I could drive my car and feel safe and know that if there is a problem I am not alone. Buick offers more expensive plans that include route planning or help.

The Problem alerts, like if you have a low tire, or the engine light comes on, all I have to do is call on-star using my rear view mirror and stereo speakers and they will run a systems check.  In about ten minutes they can tell you what the problem is and if the problem can wait or if you need to get to the repair shop a.s.a.p.

Because I am disabled, I hit the curb and blew the side out of my tire. I pushed a button and called On-Star and they sent out a repair truck with a new tire. I was back on the road within one and a half hours. This happened on a week day at 4:30 p.m., rush hour time. 

On-Star also has a mobile phone where I can make and receive calls using voice recognition technology.  This cost is extra and you have to buy your minutes, 100 minutes for two months is about $34.99.

If I am in an accident and the air bags deploy, On-Star knows right away and they try to contact you over your car speakers, if you do not answer they dispatch the police and medical right to your location. If your car is stolen, they locate your car using a satellite and assist the police in the recovery of the car.

I locked my keys in the car one day and I used my cell phone and called my husband, my friend said to me, I thought you have On-Star. Dah! I telephoned On-Star and within ten minutes my doors were unlocked, my husband arrived ten minutes later.

The only complaint that I really have is, if it is raining or you wash your windshield, your wipers push the water right in your window. I always like to have my window cracked, the inside of my door and my leg get wet every time.  Even without the wipers the rain still comes in if the window is down. 

With all of the luxury Buick provides, you would think they would add some type of overlap to keep the water out.

With the center console down, we can fit five people fairly comfortable. Three people up front is too tight for me, so if we have more than five people, we use our van. Other wise the car is roomy and we have plenty of trunk space.

We were very pleased with the control and handling of the Century and the performance of the front wheel drive with all of the snow this past winter.

The car listed for $26,900.00 and with a rebate of $2,000.00 and down payment of $1,700.00 we were on the road for $19,000.00. 

The reliability, the luxury, plenty of room, very comfortable ride, and the handling of making turns, the brakes very reliable, with anti-lock brakes and traction control.

All of the Buick features we had kept us loyal Buick Owners and we are still very satisfied with the same features and more.

Our previous Buick LeSabre was a 1991, we sold it having 230,000 miles, the next owner drove the car for another fourteen months.
