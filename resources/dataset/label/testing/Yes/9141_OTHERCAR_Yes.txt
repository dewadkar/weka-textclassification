            I don't exactly love the SUV but I definitely don't hate it.  My husband and I recently got two new vehicles.  Mine is the wonderful, fantastic, Ford Focus and he ended up with the Lincoln Navigator. Well, all joking aside, this is an amazing vehicle.  

As for the price, at first I felt that this is way overpriced, but as I rode around in it,(of course since it is not my car I'm only allowed to ride in it) I found that I can get used to the luxury real easy, the air coming in through the seats is a favorite of mine.

The other day, I snuck out and took it for a test drive so I could write this article with complete honesty.  I am not used to a large car so this was a different experience.  I found that the backup indicators (some sort of beep, beep) come on when you are near something that you could hit.  This is disconcerting at first, but is nice and gives you a sense of security when you are not used to driving so high up.

The electronics on this automobile are awesome but at the same time, it makes you wonder if there are electrical problems will it move at all.  Well it is covered under a bumper to bumper warrenty for five years so I guess that's ok.

I work in the automotive industry and have run assembly and quality control for several years so I always suggest that anyone who buys a new or used car should wash it by hand within the first week because if there are any body fits or paint defects, this is when you will find them.

I'm sorry to say that most times, the dirt, craters,and pock marks found in most cars are there to stay because it would ruin the paint to try and remove them so the industry needs to get it right the first time.

Well, they got it right on the Navigator, and if you are looking for roominess, quality, and all kinds of advanced doodads, this is the vehicle for you.

Although, in my opinion, it is still overpriced.  I'll keep my Focus.<br><br>
