            I got my first digital camera for Christmas this past year. I picked it out myself, it was the above camera. Ever since I got it, I've been using it for any and every kind of picture! With 1.3 megapixel, it takes high resolution pictures, and when downloaded on to your computer, looks just like a picture from a 35mm camera!!! The only downfall is when you print them, sometimes, depending on the picture, they come out a little fuzzy. But if you are looking for a camera that is cheap, for e-commerce, and just to post pictures on the web for yours or someone elses website, this camera will do that just fine, with few or no problems at all. When I picked the camera out, it was only $210 at Best Buy, so for a measly $200, it is definitly an excellent camera to own, and has served me well in just these past few months, and I'm sure if you also have one, it will serve you well too! The only real downfall, is learning all the symbols on top of the camera for the buttons...I have read the instruction book, and although I have figured most of them out, it has all been on a trial and error basis. Just becareful what shots you try them on, because some pictures are irreplaceable!<br><br>
