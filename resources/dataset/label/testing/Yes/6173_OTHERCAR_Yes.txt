            Company I worked for was allowed the G.M. "X Plan", and since the 14 year old truck had seen better days, (or BUFFALO WINTERS), I decided to take the plunge, and buy a new vehicle. 

I test drove the van, and immediately fell in love with it. 
I really couldn't find anything to complain about. 

Since purchasing the van, I've kept very accurate miliage records, and even in the winter, I get 22+ mpg, CITY DRIVING! On a trip to Virgina last fall, I almost cracked the 30 mpg mark.

After driving my vehicle, my wife just had to have her own, so she bought a 2000, which has the sliding passenger door, (non-electric).

She likes her choice as much as I like mine.

I really don't have any complaints, other than after hitting a deer at 30 mph, it caused exactly $3087.00 worth of damage. The damage was quite extensive, but then, all of the auto manufactures are making comprimises with the thickness of the car bodies to save weight, which translates into more damage in the event of an accident. I'm sure that any other make or model would also make my insurance agent cringe at the sight of the damage total .

I've got tinted windows, keyless entry, A/C, 6 cyl. engine, and cruise control, etc. , all for $21,000 list, $18,000 after discounts,  (in 1999).

A year later, my wife paid the same for the 2000, without keyless entry, or tinted windows, or cruise control or power windows, but she does have the passenger sliding door, which she does use.

WOuld I buy another.... In a heartbeat, AND I NOW WORK FOR A COMPETING AUTO MANUFACTURER!!!
