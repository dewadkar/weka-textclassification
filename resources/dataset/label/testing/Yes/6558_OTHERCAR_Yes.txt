            I purchased the '97 Dodge Caravan Sport, sort of on the spur of the moment.  I have always liked Dodge/Chrysler products and have always found them to be very reliable.  I purchased this vehicle after a test drive of several other minivans because this was, I found, to be the easiest to maneuver. Also purchased because of growing family.
I just adore this vehicle.  It is roomy enough for seven adults with no problems.  
Another feature I liked was the built in child seats.  I know these are not the best type of child seats, but for me it was a strong selling point.
Anyone looking for a good minivan should/could purchase this vehicle.<br><br>
