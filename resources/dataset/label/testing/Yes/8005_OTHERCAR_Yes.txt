            Is it possible for jaguar to have a sports sedan that starts at $29,000? oh yes, my friend, oh yes, it is.  I couldn't believe it, a JAGUAR for $29,000(well, that's what it STARTS for).  But, i was in the market for a new car, and decided to check this little baby out.  I was drawn to the x-type because of it's looks, i have to admit, it's a very good looking car.  Not only that, but the x-type comes standard with all wheel drive.  

So, I test drove a 2.5 manual transmission, and I really liked it.  The engine was perky, it drove nicely, i like the controls.  But I decided to test drive the 3.0 manual transmission after that.  The 3.0 manual transmission is incredibly fast, amazing pick up.  I had to have it.  That day, I ordered a 2003 X-type 3.0 liter Manual transmission.  I had to order it because the 3.0 manual is somewhat rare (but the manual gearbox is getting more popular again).  

3 months later, I had a black jaguar sitting in my driveway.  It was summer time, so I opened every window including my sunroof, and I put the pedal to the metal.  This car is just downright fun to drive.  The soundsystem is superb.  Great sound, and the controls on the navigation system (an option that I added) are wonderful as well.  But to keep your eyes on the road, Jaguar has placed controls on the steering wheel which are extremely helpful when driving in stop and go traffic.  

The navigation system on this car is an absolute must.  If you are not good with directions (i'm not), get it!  It makes finding places and addresses so much easier.  You get the address, punch it into the navigation system and the system guides you to your destination with it's very soft spoken voice with an english accent (I love that!).  The system uses satelites to keep track of your car.  

Now, the most important detail of the jaguar is the standard all wheel drive.  That's right, it's not an option, it comes standard.  This all wheel drive is a life saver in snow, literally.  It makes it up hills that are covered in snow effortlessly.  It also does great in wet.

This car handles extremely well (thanks to its all wheel drive), and it also has amazing performance because of the 231 Horsepower engine, and the manual transmission.  It really gets around corners easyily without sliding the slightest.  The car can go from a standstill to 60 in 6.6 seconds with the manual transmission (now you see why I bought the manual!).  It really has power.  

The backseats in the jaguar are a little cramped as anyone eles in this categorie will tell you, but then again, it's a sports sedan, what do you expect?  The front interior is great, it's very comfortable, the leather seats in the front and the back are very comfy.  Also, this car has a great trunk! it's BIG! 

overall, this car has been a terrific car for me.  plus, I love getting looks from people as they watch me drive past in a jaguar.
