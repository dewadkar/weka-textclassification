            I purchased this Ricoh Digital Camera about 1 1/2 yrs ago.  I wasn't sure about what to buy, how easy it is to use.  I wasn't a pro at Digital anything.  I figured it was nice to use to take pictures of my children and put them on a web site to show family around the country.  My brother-in-law had one and I thought I will buy one.  I have used it numerous times.  It comes with a installation CD.  

I didn't know that they suck batteries up like that.  Digital Cameras need to change with that aspect.  

The only drawback is after you download the images to your hard drive, everything is given a number of what image it is.  I have to go in and rename all of them.  It also saves it under a temporary folder, which later you have to change.  
It is good for those who are beginners and just learning to use a digital camera...
Hope this was helpful!
