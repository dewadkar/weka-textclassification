            Update March 23/03

One of the things I love about my job is that I get to arrange lease trucks for my employer.  Since I also travel quite a bit I have the opportunity to rent and try out a wide variety of vehicles. 

In the last 3 years I have arranged the leases on approximately 40 Dodge Dakota Extended Cab pickup trucks as well as a few trucks of other brands.  The Dakota trucks have given our company wonderful service on and off the highway.  

I recently purchased one of my employer's 1999 Dodge Dakota Ext Cab 4x4 trucks when it came off lease.  The truck is equipped with the 5.2L V-8, auto, air, cruise, AM/FM cassette, cloth seats, rear anti lock brakes, air bags, Sport package etc.  

The truck had 110,000 kms(65,000 miles) on it when I reviewed the service history of the vehicle with our leasing company's records and inspected it before purchasing it.  The truck had only required routine oil and filter changes and tire rotations during its lease term.  A thorough mechanical inspection included checking engine oil pressure and compression and revealed the truck was in great shape. 

After purchasing the truck it was thoroughly washed, cleaned, minor stone chips in the paint were touched up and it was then waxed and polished with a power buffer to take out minor scratches in the finish. I performed a thorough engine tune up and we were ready to drive what now looks and runs like a new truck. 

We love the Dakota for its roomy front seat comfort(I am 6'4"), power and great versatility.  The seats are excellent but not quite as comfortable as those in our Grand Cherokee.  This truck rides best with a partial load in the box due to the stiff rear leaf springs.

The rear passenger seat is best limited to short trips due to the low height of the seat.  This means your knees are considerably higher than your posterior which can get very uncomfortable. This seating position would be too uncomfortable for long trips unless it was an infant in a car seat or a small child

Fuel mileage has been very acceptable to date but if you are a little aggressive with the "go pedal" the mileage drops off very fast.  Acceleration is very quick and spinning the rear tires is something that happens very easily.

Cornering is great when you consider that you are in a truck not a sports car.

The original Goodyear Wranglers RTS's were just replaced at 120,000 kms (75,000 miles) for some 31 x 10.50 - 15" tires.  These were also an optional tire on these trucks and will fit quite well on the stock rims. They increase the ground clearance by several inches for the deep snow we often have to contend with up here.  I also purchased a set of the factory fender flares and my son helped me install those.  They are necessary with the larger tires to keep stones from hitting the sides of the vehicle as the larger tires are wider.

The 4x4 transfer case is a manually shifted NP231 HD unit (manual shifters are the only way to have it).  This transfer case offers 3 different settings. 
1)2 wheel drive high range for good driving conditions on paved roads 
2)4 wheel drive high range for deep snow or mud or off road conditions where you will be driving at or close to the speed limit 
3)4 wheel drive low range for extreme conditions or off road driving where your vehicle speeds are likely to be less than 5mph.  

In both low and high 4 wheel drive settings on this type of transfer case, the front and rear axles are solidly locked together.  Thus trying to drive a truck with this transfer case on dry paved roads in 4 wheel drive will cause considerable damage to the transfer case and excessive wear on the tires. This is because when you turn even a slight corner the tires on the front and rear axles are on a different radius in the turn and they must be able to turn different speeds.  With the excellent traction of a dry paved road this does not happen easily and hence something has to suffer damage.  The only reason I mention this is because I know of several people who didn't understand this concept and they very quickly destroyed their expensive transfer case by leaving it in 4 wheel drive all the time.

Is there anything we don't like?  Well, I know of a few Dakota's that required the premature replacement of the front ball joints.  However, when the safety inspection was performed on this truck the front ball joints were not showing any significant wear after 110,000 kms or 68,000 miles.  They are still good now 2 years later at 185,000 kms or a little over 110,000 miles. 

High Mileage Vehicles:
A lot of people are reluctant to buy a used vehicle with a lot of miles on the odometer so why would I want to buy a truck with this many miles on it?  Mechanics will tell you that short trips of only a few miles per trip are the worst for wear on a vehicle.  Most engine wear occurs during the first few seconds after a cold start when pressurized oil has not yet reached the engine bearings.

Thus vehicles that have only been driven on long highway trips suffer very little wear on critical components in comparison to vehicles that make frequent short trips to the grocery store.

Some will call me a liar BUT we are still running the original factory shock absorbers, exhaust system, brake shoes and pads.  I pulled off the rear drums last fall and there was no point in changing the linings as there was at least 50% left.  Same on the front disc brake pads.  This is the result of highway driving. This kind of stuff lasts forever on the highway.   

I knew this truck had been driven by one of our salesmen on long trips and that the truck had received frequent scheduled maintenance which is also critical for getting long life out vehicle components.

Our families experience with high mileage vehicles includes the following:

1988 Ford LTD wagon(my fathers)V-8, auto - 495,000kms or 305,000 miles and still the engine & transmission are original and untouched

1985 Dodge Minivan with 2.6L Mitsubishi and auto.  This was a troublesome engine that frequently died at less than 70,000 miles due to a complicated timing and silent shaft chain system which was very rarely serviced and thus frequently failed.  Our first engine lasted 180,000 miles but the transmission is still original and untouched at 410,000 kms or 254,000 miles

1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0 L inline 6 and auto - 355,000 kms or 220,000 miles on original engine and auto, still going strong and drives like new.

Summary:
We have had numerous other high mileage vehicles and thus we are looking forward to putting at least another 120,000 miles(200,000 kms ) on this 1999 Dodge Dakota.  Since this opinion was originally written in October, 2000 I have put on 44,000 trouble free miles (75,000 kilometres) on our Dakota travelling across Western Canada on business or family use for pleasure.  This truck still has not been in the dealership shop for any repairs other than a factory recall, a tuneup, change or rotate tires and oil and filter changes.
Keep in mind this is after 4 years of service and 110,000 miles or about 185,000 kms.

As with most pickup trucks you can smooth out the ride and increase 2 wheel drive traction by adding several hundred pounds of weight at the rear of the box near the tailgate.  I place a 2 x 4 across the box between the tailgate and the fender wells.  Then I throw in about 6 bags of sand (50 lbs ea.) wrapped in plastic.  This makes an amazing difference in the winter to traction and braking.  A side benefit is if your rear tires are not slipping or spinning they are not wearing out prematurely!

It is an excellent vehicle with few limitations. I have had the opportunity to rent and test drive most of the other brands of smaller trucks out there including the new V-8 powered Toyota. In my opinion the Dakota is still the best and the biggest of the small trucks on the market.  It can carry a payload, seat 5, (very tight if all adults) tow a heavy trailer and yet it is nimble for city driving and parking.
