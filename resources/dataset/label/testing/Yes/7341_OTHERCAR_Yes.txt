              This is a relatively compact & lightweight camera that produces excellent pictures.  Most of its features resemble those found in higher priced devices.  Specifically, the camera's layout of control buttons is both effective and extremely intuitive; This is nice if you're one who tends to completely ignore the manual.  3.2 mp is enough to make a 11x14 print, so that category of performance is off the charts in my 'average consumer' opinion.  The robust variety of shooting modes and additional bells & whistles allow the casual point & shoot photographer like myself to be adventurous in taking new kinds of unique pictures.

  To further enhance the versatility of this camera, I think one of its most advanced features is the fact that its video capture length is only limited by the capacity of the memory stick.  This is not true for most other cameras I researched (most others limit a video 'clip' to 30 secs or so).  Battery life is higher than expected, and AA size batteries are the easiest to find & replace when traveling.  (NiMH batteries included!!!).  My only small complaint is that that video capture appears very dark (But photos are crisp, well-lit & perfect).

I recommend reading full product information from some retailer, to learn about every little feature this thing offers!!
