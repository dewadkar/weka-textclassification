            When i was 19 years old, a second year college student I had accumulated what i had considered a large sum of money.  Instead of saving and investing that money, i decided to do what any teenage boy would do, buy a hot red sport car.  So thats what i did.  I put my 6500$ together and purchased a 1990 Acura Legend LS.  This model had all the bells and whistles.  By the time i got it it had over 80,000 miles, but the car looked and ran beutiful.  the Legend has 2.7 liter inline 6 cylender engine.  This engine produces 172hp, with a 6,500rpm redline.  This car accelerates and turns like a german sports car, but you ride in comfort like  lounging in the most luxurious of Cadillacs.  THe most astonishing fact about these cars are there reliability.  Although the repairs are Import-expensive, they are few and far between. I love this car and am still driving it to this day. ( 128,000miles) I dohave one fault with the LS, no cupholders!<br><br>
