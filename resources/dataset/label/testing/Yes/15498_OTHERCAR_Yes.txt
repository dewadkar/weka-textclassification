            We recently purchased the FD-88 digital camera. I was greatly surprised at the simplicity of how it works. The instructions were easy to read and follow in producing quality pictures for computer usage. The greatest advantage this type of camera has is the floppy disk technology. I have found that to be much simpler than the &quot;smart&quot; film used in the other digital cameras. Not having to mess with the computer ports and AV outlets makes this a small wonder for us computer &quot;dummies.&quot;  One other facet of this camera that I like is the quick recharging time on the battery. Sony did a good job of speeding up that process.  All in all I really don't see a down-side to this product. <br><br>
