            It seems that these days a good digital camera is becoming more and more of a necessity and less of a luxury. The desire to capture a moment in a person's life and digitize it to treasure for all of eternity is growing. Days of taking <i>ye olde 35mm film</i> to the processing center and waiting for it to be developed are nearly gone, as storing things electronically becomes an easier and more convenient method of doing things. It is with this growth in popularity that advancements in digital camera technology changed a luxury into a near-necessity for beginners and extreme photo-shooting enthusiasts alike.

Enter the Nikon Coolpix 2500 Digital Camera. At an affordable price, this camera comes loaded with features and quality that no amateur photographer should be without, and certainly puts meaning into the phrase "Bang for your Buck" For the generation of consumers this camera was aimed at (Gen "Y"), this camera <b>SCREAMS</b> "Buy Me!" and will certainly not disappoint. Apart from professional photographers who are justifiably picky about their shooting options, it will also please just about everyone else in the digital camera market as well.

Starting with the appearance, I just couldn't take my eyes off the attractive body styling. Compact and stylish, this is not your ordinary "bulky" camera. With its polished silver and smooth blue color scheme it is sure to turn heads and is certainly pleasing on the eyes. The lens is innovatively hidden within the base housing, protecting it from dust and scratching, and can be easily "swiveled out" to take a picture. Also great for self portraits, the lens can be rotated to face the photographer, who can then see him or herself in the 1.5" LCD screen immediately off to the right. While only able to rotate 90 degrees in this fashion, the lens can rotate nearly a full 180 degrees out in front of the camera, save for the very top and bottom vertical views which are blocked by the base. This design feature is very useful for, say, sitting in the bleachers at a football game and taking pictures over the tall person in front of you. Simply rotate the camera lens forward and toward the bottom of the camera until it clicks, hold the camera in front of you above your head with the LCD screen facing down, and take your picture when ready (In this case, just be sure not to block the view of the person behind you).

The camera is point-and-shoot right out of the box, and for <b>excellent</b> semi-professional pictures almost anywhere, press the shutter button down halfway to allow it to auto focus, then give it a full push to snap the picture. An indicator on the LCD screen actively displays whether or not the camera could successfully focus - this all happens BEFORE the shot is actually taken. The camera has 3 different levels of picture quality and 4 different sizes. Usually, both <b>Normal</b> and <b>Basic</b> quality are sufficient for most picture taking needs, and generate EXCELLENT printouts, while <b>Fine</b> would be used for taking an 8x10 or 5x7 photo where lots of detail is necessary for a good picture. Other features in the camera include an option for setting <b>White Balance</b>, which comes with 6 presets (including the default which is <i>automatic</i>). If it's overcast outside, an easy setting change to <i>Cloudy</i> can produce better results in your photos, but don't expect to see too much of a difference in that tiny LCD screen. The real quality of the photo can only be seen on a computer at its own size. Exposure can be set plus or minus 2.0 at intervals predefined by the camera (0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.0). A nifty little feature is the ability to put it on <b>Continuous</b> shooting mode and it will keep taking pictures as long as you hold the shutter release down. Useful for those slow moving or constantly changing targets, all the pictures are saved to the Compact Flash card currently in the camera and you can choose which you want. There is also <b>Multi-Shot 16</b>, only available at the highest picture size, which allows the user to take 16 continuous pictures and merge them into a nice collage. I haven't found a use for this as of yet, but I'm sure if I re-checked the manual I could find one. Also worth mentioning is the <b>Best Shot Selector (BSS)</b> which will take pictures until you release the shutter button and then automatically choose the shot which is the clearest/sharpest - deleting the rest. <b>Image Sharpening</b> would be the last option on the "Shoot" menu, and while it defaults to automatic image sharpening, it can be set to high, normal, low, or off.

Another interesting feature of the Coolpix 2500 is the ability to select "scenes", which are predefined settings for shutter speed, flash, exposure, white balance, and such. There are scenes such as: Close Up, Fireworks, Backlight, Museum, Night Portrait, Party/Indoor and others. If you're in an area that doesn't allow camera flash, you can easily set the scene to "Museum" - however the flash can just as easily be disabled by using the Flash button underneath the LCD, so there may be more to it than that. The <b>Close Up</b> scene will allow you to get to the extreme details and closeups of an object, good for eBay pictures. If you wish to take pictures of Fireworks, set it to that scene, and take a perfect picture focusing on a fireworks display (Optimally by moving the camera along with the "flare" of the firework, and pressing the shutter rlease button <i>just</i> as or before it bursts)

The camera also has a "movie mode" which will shoot 15 seconds of soundless movie, and it seems to be pretty high quality. I found it particularly fun to capture rare and exciting moments - such as two pugs fighting or the priceless expression on a friend's face during a surprise party. 15 seconds may not sound like much, but it's just enough to see the things that make life great in living color as they unfold.

The camera ships with a 16mb Compact Flash (CF) card, which is adequate if you don't plan on taking too many pictures at one time, but if you'd like excellent 5x7 photos and don't have a computer with you at all times, a 64mb card should be your minimum. It does not matter which manufacturer you choose for your CF card because they all perform exactly the same, so when you're out shopping for cards don't worry about paying the highest marked price because of quality. A 128mb CF card can easily be picked up for $31 off of the internet if you know where to look - no need to be picky. Battery life in the camera is excellent, despite what I heard before trying the camera out for myself. The first charge of the supplied battery only put out about 90 minutes of power, however subsequent charges have yielded 4 hours of power with CONTINUOUS use. I took over 375 exposures, deleting pictures and taking movies while I went along, and the battery performed flawlessly. Nevertheless, I recommend an additional one or two EN-EL2 batteries for backup, also found quite inexpensive on the internet. I chose to go way of non-Nikon manufacturer however if you go that route, prepare to be paying a pretty penny. I haven't encountered a problem with my alternate battery yet.

The only reason I gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 is for 2 reasons: No optical viewfinder and the inability to change the shutter speed. In the dark with no light whatsoever, it can be difficult to see the picture you are taking through the LCD screen (however, over time, I have learned to master "blind shot" techniques). Additionally, without <b>bright</b> sunlight or flash, pictures can often-times turn out blurry. There may be a way around this with certain options but I haven't yet found the right combination. This is obviously a problem with features like <b>Continuous shot</b> because there are no flashes whatsoever. It would be impractical to have it flash at all in this mode (imagine flashing your subject 15 times with this ultra-bright light!), so I would not suggest adding it... just a way to alter shutter speed would be GREATLY appreciated. Red eye is more or less a minor problem, but can easily be corrected on the computer, which is where these pictures need to go before printing anyway (Printers with CF slots aside).

I recommend buying a USB Reader for your CF Flash cards rather than using the provided cable to connect the camera. I have heard that over time it is not good on the camera to have it directly connected and transferring files to the camera. One of these can be picked up for $20, and many Media Center PC's (those with Windows XP Media Center Edition) have all-in-one card readers, so it shouldn't be too much for your budget to handle.

Overall, taking pictures with the Nikon 2500 is a breeze. There are enough options and controls to ensure high quality photos each and every time, a simple interface for reviewing and deleting pictures on-the-fly from the camera itself, and a nifty movie recording feature as an added bonus. A little practice and you'll be taking pictures like the professionals in no time... prepare to be amazed.
