            Roof Riding??  what is that supposed to be  i prefer the under the chassy riding feature.  hanging on for dear life onto the wheel axels with your body not an inch from the ground is what im talking about.  The car is great for this option with its smooth ride and clean exhaust system.  Never a problem with not enough room cause youcan jsut stick one of your lucky friends under the car   personally i find it more comfortable then sitting in the plush seats.  if given the option  i always go udner the car, just a little hard in the snow cause then you get smashed all over<br><br>
