            I went from driving a 1999 Altima, to my 2001 Frontier!  All I can say is WOW!  After looking for my first &#147new&#148 car, I decided that Nissan was the way for me, and picked up my Altima, only about 2 years old.  I fell in love with it.  Nissan was the vehicle for me.  After having my car for a little over a year I decided I wanted a truck&#133there was no question where to go.  BACK TO THE NISSAN DEALER!

I had fallen in love with the Frontier months before.  From seeing them drive down the road, to talking to a friend who owned one.  Another friend and I went to the dealership so he could find himself a new car, when I spotted &#147The&#148 truck!&#148  It was exactly what I wanted.  A 2001 Nissan Frontier SE, Crew cab with four-wheel drive, 6-disk CD changer, and steering wheel mounted audio controls, Roof rack, side steps, 24,000 miles and much MUCH more.  I took it for a test drive, and I knew I had to have it.

Now, after having it for several months and already driven through several larger winter storms, I know I made the right decision.  The truck rides like a magic carpet.  It handles the roads and bumps with ease, almost making you think you&#146re in a Cadillac.   And if you forget you&#146re in a truck, reach down and grab the &#147twist&#148 style emergency break handle, and give it a good yank!

As far as power and handling are concerned, no qualms here!  Of course, going from a 4-cylender to a 6 is a huge jump, so my opinion is limited here.  For the most part, with a gentle press of the accelerator, the truck leaps into action, and I&#146m off flyin down the road.  I especially like to drive my truck down the Highway.  No more struggling to get up to speed.  With the greatest of ease the truck gets up, and kicks the pants off those around me.  With the governor set at 90 MPH, it limits just how much &#147fun&#148 you can have, but I don&#146t think it&#146s all that safe to be doing any more then that in a truck.  And even when your at 90, the truck is WICKED quiet.   Absolutely no problems!  As far as handling is concerned, it&#146s not bad at all.  With the exception of the crappy stock tires where the tred is to close together, and tends to slide a little on the snowy conditions, the rest of the truck handles wonderfully.  The steering is precise, and tight.  And when it comes to muddy back roads, or snow covered parking lots, I definitely feel safe behind the wheel of this truck. When it comes to stopping, Nissans have an odd feeling of  &#147will I actually stop!&#148  This is mostly due to their auto adjusting breaking system.  I had the same problems with my Altima, and I thought their was something wrong.  Its actually perfectly normal, and when you NEED to stop, have no doubt that you will.  

  The back seat is adequate for short trips.  I&#146ve had a 6 1/2 foot tall person in the back seat, and they said it was amazingly comfortable for the amount of space, although they wouldn&#146t want to go for a 3-hour trip.  I myself have climbed into the back and sat there for a few minutes just for the fun of it.  I myself LOVE to be stretched out, and usually cannot find enough room.  I agree with what my buddy said, although amazingly comfortable, no long trips back their for me!

The space behind the back seat is tight, but gives enough space for jumper cables, snowbrush, small gear bag and extra coat.  The bed of the truck is small, which is fixed with the 2002 model, which offers a much-needed longer bed.  When it comes to the driver&#146s seat I tend to like to drive with my legs fully stretched out.  I&#146m not a tall person, only 5 Feet tall, and although close, I still cannot fully stretch my legs out.  Even with the seat all the way back, I still am not completely comfortable.  The seats them selves aren&#146t bad.  The fabric covering them looks and feels very rugged, and as an added bonus, their also water poof!  My smaller frame sits comfortably in the seat, and with the exception to the head rest, which when I lean back I feel like I&#146m looking at the ceiling, I give seating a thumbs up!

The look of the truck is rugged, sexy, and stylish.  You can drive it camping, or out to a formal dinner and always look good.  The roof rack and side steps add to the classy look of the truck, and are a must.  The plastic yet rugged flairs on the wheel wells well give it a &#147don&#146t mess with me look.&#148

The control knobs for the air control system (AC, Heat) are rugged feeling, and add to the &#147truck&#148 look of the vehicle.  The ground clearance (about 11 INCHES!!!)  , which rivals that of other trucks in its class, and even some of those larger trucks, adds to the universal quality this truck had.  The solid feel of the doors, knobs and other moving parts makes me feel comfortable that is wont break any time soon.  With the controls in easy to reach, and sensible places it can make anyone feel comfortable when they have to click on the hazard lights in a hurry.

With all the other great things about this truck it makes the minor things&#133well&#133.MINOR!
