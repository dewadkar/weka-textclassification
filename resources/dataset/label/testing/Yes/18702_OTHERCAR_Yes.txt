            After being fed up with how long and not to mention expensive my 35mm film processing was for school and for personal use (I am a design student at UCLA, and photography processing is always enormously expensive), and after realizing how much more productive I'd be with my webpages with a digital camera, I began to look around for the best deals. 

After really thinking about it, I figured that the most important features to me in my work would be having full creative control, as a lot of my work involves photography based design, I like being able to change aperture and fstop settings, but since I work in web based media, it is incredibly convenient to have a digital image ready to be imediately worked on. Also high quality was important to me as far as pixel resolution went, so that I would be free to manipulate the images starting with the highest quality and size, so I would be free in all of my designs. So heres what I was looking for:

- Fully manual capabilities (exposure and shutter speed, among other things, such as manual flash)
- High quality images, high resolution
- Easy to carry around
- High image storing capabilities

My father had reccomended RefurbDepot.com for good deals on electronics, since the prices are lower and the quality is exactly the same on all items, only with the "stigma" of being refurbished or cosmetically blemished. So, I headed for that site, and started comparing prices and features.

The amount of cameras I could find that were fully manual narrowed it down significantly, almost immediately down to the Olympus line of Camedia cameras and much more expensive professional-grade cameras (that were certainly out of my price range). So based on this fact and comparing prices I finally decided on the C-2000. 

After it arrived (which took longer than I'd expected, but I suppose that is RefurbDepots deal, not Olympus's), I was anxious to try it out. The first thing I was very impressed with was the weight and look of the camera - it is very light! Even my father, who is very picky about the grade and quality of electronics, was very impressed with the camera. 

I put the batteries in and noticed that the catch to open the battery compartment is quite difficult to close once you get the batteries in. You really have to push against the weight of the camera, much as you do with an overstuffed suitcase. However, I figured this wouldnt be a problem often, since the batteries would last a while. 

I started playing around with the set-up program and its very simple and intuitive - very easy to change the settings. It offers a full range of compression and dimension options, as well as other options. It is also very easy to delete the pictures, and the whole navagation system of viewing pictures is also very intuitive. 

One slightly annoying thing I noticed was that the power button is more prominent than the button to take the pictures, so often I would go to take a picture and turn the camera off instead. It feels as though it is in the place where the picture button should be, and is in fact, in front of it.. it is something I had to get used to.

Other than that small complaint, I am very happy with the camera so far. The only reccomendation I would give to everyone looking to purchase this camera is to buy nickel metal-hydride batteries and an ac adapter - the camera uses a LOT of battery power, and nickel metal hydride batteries are excellent and can be recharged. The batteries that came with my camera were regular AA photo batteries and died after only 15 minutes of total camera use (at the MOST).
