            If you are interested in this car and have the money for it, all I can tell you is to take it for a test drive. Why would you want to get this car over any of the other AUDI cars or AUDI A6 wagon.....well, if you drive each of them - you will feel the difference. The ALLROAD has a uncanny ability to seem a lot smaller than it is and it sure drives like a small sports car - sometimes I am reminded of its power when I touch the pedal a little too much. I am used to having to wait for the car to accelerate....not with this car. And it is so incredibly quiet inside and outside the car, that you can't tell whether the car is on.
I am a woman and don't know much about the car's engine or anything like that, but I can tell you this is a performance car. It makes you happy to drive and you want to go everywhere with it. 
The incredible part of this car is its ability to raise itself in 2 inch increments and alter its shock systems at a touch of a button to clear objects and to go off-roading (if you are into that kind of thing). It is great for getting out of unshoveled snow-covered driveways. At a speed of 75 miles an hour, the car will automatically lower itself 2 inches to become more aerodynamic - racing mode. 
If that doesn't get you to drool......

On an everyday basis, it outperforms any car I have ever driven.....including the BMW X5 and the Mercedes M class. They do not hug corners nor make you feel as safe as the ALLROAD does. I have also had a few friends who own the BMW X5 who have complained about feeling unsafe when taking tight corners (might tip or something).

Well, I recommend a test drive to anyone. You will be sold on the car the minute you sit in that seat and put the car into DRIVE.
