                I bought my Taurus in the summer of 2000 with 75,000 miles already tacked on it for $6000--a good reason to have some skepticism. Eighteen months and 25,000 miles later, my worries have been washed away, and no matter what happens from here on out, I will be forever satisfied.
    I'll admit, the exterior design did not appeal to me at all, and had I not taken a test-drive, I never would have bought the car. My previous car was a leased Hyundai Elantra, so my first drive in the Taurus revealed some very noticeable upgrades. 
    Acceleration was pretty good--smooth, yet powerful. Steering was, and still is, the best I've ever experienced in a car (not too loose, not too tight). The controls are easily accessible, and the stereo is at chest-level--a wonderful change from the stereos I've had to bend over to reach. Several 1,500-mile summer trips have proven the seats to be very comfortable. The folding bench seat in the back is so relaxing and spacious it's almost hypnotic. 
    Two minor features that I've really come to appreciate are the pneumatic hood and spring loaded trunk. Salty, snowy roads in the winter require extensive use of windshield-washer fluid, which needs to be refilled every two weeks or so. A little lifting of the hood sends it slowly up into an upright position--no fumbling around with the support arm and worrying about smashed fingers. 
    Similarly, the trunk, when activated, also pops up into an upright position without any assistance. I can simply "throw and go." I don't have to set anything on my bumper to lift it open.
    As far as maintenance and repairs go, trips to the lube centers are all I've had to do. No mechanical or electrical failure or problems what-so-ever. I have, however, been involved in a steady string of collisions (mostly while I'm stationary at a stop-light), and I've determined that the reason for this is the silver color of the Taurus I own. I asked my body technician, who I've come to know quite well, and he admitted that 65% of his business is with silver and gray vehicles. So, be forewarned. 
    I'm on the interstates quite a bit, and some of the features that the Taurus has that make those trips easier are the power feature of the driver's side window, the smoothness of the ride, the responsive handling, the minimal air and tire noise, the innovative cruise control, and the gas mileage.
    The power window on the driver's side rolls completely down with just a tap of the button. So, when I'm approaching tolls and ticket booths, I tap the button and spend the extra couple seconds gathering the fees. You probably won't understand why I like this until you try it. 
    The ride, like I said earlier, is very smooth, especially with a good set of tires. The car is fairly aerodynamic too, so it's relatively easy to control during windy days on the Chicago expressways or gusts on the rural thoroughfares. On the same token, the noise generated from the air and the road is fairly quiet inside the car. A steady "whoosh" is about all I hear.
    The cruise control also has a nice feature. Say I'm cruising along at 60 MPH (being hypothetical), and everyone around me seems to be going 63 MPH. Well, I just tap the "Set/Accel" button three times and I'll be going 63 as well. Feeling like going back down to 60, I just tap the "Coast" button three times and I'm in business. I tap the buttons as many times as I like to speed up and slow down. I've driven for hundreds of miles without even touching the pedals. 
    Estimated highway gas mileage at 26 mpg seems a bit conservative to me. Iï¿½ve found it to be closer to 30 mpg, but of course, that plummets to around 20 mpg if the A/C is on.
    My one and only complaint on the Taurus is the center console. It's designed to become a third seat if necessary, and the back of the seat can fold down as an armrest. In addition, if I open and fold out the seat portion, I have a cup holder, pop-can holder, cassette tape compartment, coin slots, and a bin to put miscellaneous stuff in. However, when I have that open, which I almost always do, I lose all access to the ashtray and, more importantly, the cigarette lighter which I use to power my laptop, cell phone etc. Even more irritating is the fact that the compartment can't fully open unless the ashtray is completely closed. I could either power up my devices and set my drinks somewhere else (yeah right) or spend countless hours looking for adapters small enough to be able to enclose inside the ashtray.
    So, I spent about a month scouring the stores for adapters with short stems and thin cords that I could plug into the socket and still close the ashtray so I could open the compartment to access my coins and set my drink down. I can't complain now, it works. But I almost sold the car because of it. 
    Overall, I love my car. I have found it to be extremely reliable in all weather conditions, from 30 degrees below zero to 110 degrees in the sun. The front-wheel drive allows it to cut through snow and ice quite well, and it has a sturdy, solid body that protects well in collisions.
    All the options and features of the car are functional and practical, with the exception of the center console. It's a great ride. 
    I have read the horror stories about this car and, well, any car can be a good or bad experience for someone. However, general maintenance and care of the car will prevent many problems from happening. 
     I just rolled over 100,000 miles the other day, and still absolutely no problems or even the faintest hint of any.
