            We purchased our Dodge Durango back in April of this year.

We looked at several different Durangos, different colors with different packages.  We finally decided on the Flame Red Durango.

Our Durango has a 5.2-liter V8 engine.  This baby has power!  There is also a 5.9-liter engine, but we didn�t want it.  We chose not to go with the 4X4 as well.  We decided it was something we really didn�t need.

As for the driving of this vehicle, it is great.  The ride is smooth and it corners well.  There isn�t a lot of road noise either. 

We have a CD with equalizer and four speakers, nothing fancy, but has great sound.  Our Durango came with the 3rd row seat, which was one of the main reasons why we wanted this vehicle.  There is so much room in the Durango.  We can seat 8 in ours.  We have the 60/40 split bench in the front and the second row seats, allowing room for 6 there.  With the 3rd row seat, you can seat 2 more people in the back. 

We can fold down the 3rd row seat and the 2nd row seats and have so much cargo space.  With the seat in the up right position, we still have plenty of space.  We just recently went on a long distance trip and had enough room in the back with the seats up for suitcases for 5 people, as well as, other items such as blankets, pillows, ball gloves, and roller blades.

We have the rear air conditioning, a must to have with the 3rd seat.  Believe me, it can get pretty cool in our Durango.  There were no complaints on cooling during our trip.  

As for the gas mileage, we did better than we thought we would.  We got 18 miles per gallon on our trip.  Our sticker said 14 to 19 mpg in the city and on the highway.  Needless to say, we were pleased with this.  Now if the price of gas would just go down!

There are many options you can get with this vehicle.  It comes in a wide variety of colors and matching interiors.  The awesome design of the vehicle is enough to catch an eye regardless of the color.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting room, looks, comfort, and style in a vehicle.  The Dodge Durango has it all!  This is truly a monstrous vehicle.
