            I bought this car and have had no problems with it. It rides very smoothly. If you want a car with power this is the car for you. I'm only 20 years old so of course it had to have power. If youï¿½re comparing it to a Honda civic or accord the Malibu is way quicker off the line. I have beaten all those and a ford escort zx2 all had manual transmission. It is a great car in the snow. Big trunk space can fit four snowboards in the trunk. Lots of room inside have had five college students in there and they all complimented my car. For a four-door car it is very sporty. It also get 30MPG.
