            For the money the Isuzu Rodeo is a good SUV with plenty of room for the family and a good towing capacity.  The ease of ownership for this vehicle is unbelieveable have had one since 1994 and have had no problems with it at all.  The comfort on long trips is also a pleasure.  If you don't like being high off the ground and you want an SUV I strongly recommend the Isuzu Rodeo, it maintains a low center of gravity which helps to avoid rollovers also compared to most of the other SUVs on the market.  If you want an Sport Utility Vehicle that drives and feels like a car than the Isuzu Rodeo is the way to go. <br><br>
