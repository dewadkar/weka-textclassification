              I purchased my Toyota Corolla as a previously owned vehicle a year ago.  It is a 1997 SE model, which had 24,000 miles on it at the time of purchase.  As I am a first time car owner, I did extensive research and collected opinions from as many consumers as possible.  The overwhelming response from the average consumer and experts alike really did not come as a surprise: Toyota! 

  I wanted a car that was an incredible value, durable, stylish, dependable and practical.  My Corolla is all of these things and more. I get great gas mileage and it seems to run for an eternity after the gas gauge reads &quot;Empty&quot;. It handles well and always takes the curves smoothly.
The interior is actually much roomier than I originally thought, and dual-side air bags make me feel secure.  

  At the time of this review, I have owned my Corolla for close to a year, and have thus far had no problems at all.  This car has proven to be hassle-free and I would recommend it to first-time buyers as well as anyone else who is interested in a practical, reliable means of transportation.  In fact, I will recommend it to anyone who'll listen!
I know that I'll be driving my Toyota for years to come.  When it finally does wear out, I'll probably buy another one.<br><br>
