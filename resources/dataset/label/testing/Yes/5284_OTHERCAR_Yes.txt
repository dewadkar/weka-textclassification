            Honda continues their tradition of engineering excellence with the latest version of the Honda Accord. Our Accord is a 1998 LX, 4-door sedan, powered by Honda's VTEC 4-cylinder engine. An automatic transaxle transfers power to the front wheels. The Accord LX features an extensive standard equipment list: Power windows, power door locks, an excellent AM/FM/cassette 4-speaker stereo, cruise control, power-assisted steering and power-assisted brakes (disks up front and drums in the rear). We added the factory CD player as an option. It integrates nicely with and is controlled by the factory stereo system. Terrific sound. But the antenna in the rear window glass seems to limit fringe radio reception.

We bought our Accord after comparing similar medium-size 4-door sedans from Toyota, Ford, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Chrysler and Volkswagen. The Honda stood out from the rest in its ability to do all things well. It combines passenger comfort, storage space, ride, handling, and overall athleticism in one excellent package. The Accord achieves a synergy that is not unlike the more expensive BMW, Audi, Lexus and Acura sedans.

Our Accord is about 18 months old and has traveled across the United States twice with frequent shorter jaunts to and from Southern California. It is an excellent long-distance traveler that devours the miles while passing most of the filling stations along the way. 

Most of our Accord's 52,000 miles are desert highway miles at 70 to 75 miles per hour on asphalt and concrete freeways, and asphalt primary roads. About 1/3 of our driving is city/suburban in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Our Accord gets 28 to 32 miles per gallon on the highway, 23 to 26 miles per gallon in city driving: about 27 to 28 miles per gallon overall.

The Accord should be on your shopping list if you have BMW tastes on a middle-class working family budget and like the idea and execution of a true driver's car. The Accord handles 4 adults well or 2 adults and 3 children. If your family size is 6 or larger, you need to look at a larger vehicle.

If interior quietness and a silky ride are of utmost importance to you, you might be happier with a Toyota Camry (or an Accord V-6 LX/EX sedan).

8/4/2000 Update:

Our Accord now has 73,000 miles on it. One problem so far: The thermal switch that controls the electric cooling fan malfunctioned. The car would maintain coolant temperature while the car was in motion but would heat up above normal while waiting at traffic lights. The switch was replaced under warranty. Problem solved. Routine maintenance otherwise. The Accord remains as tight as it was when new.

1/3/2004 Update:

Our Accord now has 170,000 miles on it. No additional problems have surfaced over the miles. We have performed all recommended preventive maintenance on this car and nothing more. We admire this car's quality and durability so much that we purchased a 2003 Honda Odyssey one year ago as our family vehicle. I use the Accord as a long distance commuter (110 miles per day, 4 days per week). The Accord fills this role superbly.

The exterior has held up well over the past five years: No noticeable fading. The interior has held up equally as well. The car remains tight and as quiet as it was new. All of our acquaintances are amazed when they find out this car has over 170K miles on it.

Why would you care how well a 1998 Honda Accord holds up? Consider that the 1998 through 2003 Honda Accords are virtually the same: A few cosmetic changes as well as minor evolutionary improvements that Honda implements during their product's 5-year life cycle. Also, the drive train continues with few modifications to this day. The odds are that your Honda will hold up as well as mine if not abused and if all routine maintenance is performed as scheduled.

Prior to purchasing our Accord, I respected and admired Honda's engineering and reliability from afar. Today, after 170K in our Accord, I'm afraid Honda has me hooked as a loyal follower of the brand. I know of no better-engineered and constructed vehicle for a reasonable price. Honda is indeed worth the premium it commands in comparison with some of the lower priced but inferior products it competes with.
