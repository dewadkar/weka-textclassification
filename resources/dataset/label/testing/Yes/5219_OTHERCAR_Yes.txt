            I bought this camera at Fry's for $300, so it wasn't to expensive. It takes great pictures, and is compact, so it's good for travel. Some of the bad things are that you have to print the pictures, so you need a printer and color ink cartridges. I have two little boys and it's been great to take pictures of them with. You can take 10 of the same pictures and not worry about wasting film. Also, you don't have the expense of developing. It can go through batteries quickly, but you could use rechargeable. It comes with a 2 mg disk, which holds about 12 pictures, but you can buy larger ones, up to 16 mg, but they are around $100 and hold about 95 pictures depending on their size. Another problem I've noticed is that it uses up a lot of hard drive space with the hundreds of pictures. I have almost 200 mg just of pictures. Over all, I think this is a great camera, especially for parents. It is quiet when taking pictures, good for sleeping babies, and saves the picture quickly, good for restless 2- year olds. Another plus is, you can preview the pictures before you save them, or you can look at previously saved pictures and delete the ones you don't like off the camera. My husband has also found it handy for work, and the picture quality is very good.<br><br>
