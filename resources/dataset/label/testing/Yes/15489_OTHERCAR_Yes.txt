            This camera was purchased for home and family use and has met all my expectations.
The large LCD is clear and is backlit and has adjustable back lighting with a slider on the back of the camera. 
The zoom feature if this camera is excellent and the resulting photos are good. 
The onscreen battery life indicator is accurate and a nice plus. The standard battery gives you two hours of picture taking/editing. the batteries recharge quickly also. 
This camera gives you a lot of flexibility with its on screen menu and special features such as macro capabilities and special effects.
The feature that I enjoy most is the fact that it stores your images to a 3.5 floppy disk. This eliminates the need for expensive storage cards and cabling to your computer system. Just pop in the floppy and your pictures are ready to use or edit. Another plus is the ability to copy the disk in the camera and instantly share your pictures with another.
Although this camera is a little larger than many others it is not a detriment to taking it and using it anywhere.
