            I own a dark blue BMW 7 Series and a black 5.  Four drivers in my family.  I drive both BMW's a lot.  So, I know how they compare and what I like and dislike about them.


1 Ride and handling. The 7 is very smooth and comfortable.  It doesn't have the &quot;big boat&quot; feel of a lot of large cars.  Instead, it handles and feels about as close to a sports car as a big car can -- but if fast cornering, &quot;feel of the road&quot; and general sports car feel are what you want in a luxury car, the 5 series is a better choice.  The 7 rides like a dream and is very comfortable.  Kick it down and it jumps...both the 7 and the 5 (get the big engine).

2. Room and passenger comfort.  The 7 is a LOT bigger inside than the 5.  They say headroom is the same, or about the same, but I'm tall and I fit much better in the 7.  It's just bigger...more room.  The IL has so much room in the back that passengers rave about it.

3. Sound system.  The sound is very good...and can easily be adjusted to suit your ear...not just volume and balance, but sound (jazz, concert, etc.).

4. GPS: I have the Global Positioning System in both cars.  All I can say is: get it.  It's fun and useful...got lost in a downtown area late at night once...and just set the GPS to my destination.  Didn't have to stop and find directions or roam around looking.  It's great.  But please, don't play with it while driving!

5. Control Panel &amp; Instruments: I like the way the control panel and instruments work.  Many have multiple ways to operate...either on the dash or from the very smart steering wheel.  Functional and fun.

6. Seats: The seats are the best.  Heated, and warm up fast.  Comfortable.  Very adjustable.  Three preset positions to assist multiple drivers.

7. Computer: Best I've ever seen.  Sit and play with it sometime...really learn how to use it.  It's fun and very useful. 

8. Lock/Unlock/Windows: I love the remote.  When I roll the windows down and open the roof remote, it cools so fast...not more jumping into a hot car...even the black one.

9. Phone: The phone is built-in, convenient and easy to use.Program it with frequently used numbers.  Talk to it!

10. Service: Yes, it is a luxury car.  Don't expect service to be inexpensive.  But, I've had great service.

Conclusion: Both the 7 and the 5 are great.  If you are tall or wide, get the 7 for sure.  If you have passengers frequently and want them to be very comfortable, get the 7.  If you are small and don't have a lot of passengers, get the 5...it costs less and is more fun to drive.
