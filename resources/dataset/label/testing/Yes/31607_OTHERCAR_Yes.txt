            I have been wanting a Digital Camera for a while, so when I seen the Nikon Coolpix 800 on sale for $474.00 which is Including a $75.00 Rebate . I jumped on the price and sweet talked my wife in to going to &quot;BEST BUY&quot; and get one. I also bought a USB card reader to go with it so as not to tie the Camera up when downloading...  and to also save on batteries and speed things up a whole lot faster! The first day I got the camera I was taking photos around the house and to my surprise they turned out quite well! I will be using this camera a lot this year as I have a  new Grand daughter (The main reason my wife let me buy it)...I highly recommend this camera it sure does take great pictures! It has a very good Macro Lens so you can take real close photos. BUY IT you will not be sorry!!!<br><br>
