            I bought a 1995 honda accord ex two years ago. i was despartly in need of a reliable car. i really have to say that i love this car and that my children enjoy traveling in it. i have driven as long as 700 miles and all i had to do was gas the car up.   
made it to my destanation and back home without any problems. traveling was a breeze. the trunk has a lot of space and the back seat fold down. i love this car, i have never had any real problems.

i only give it gas a tuneup and an oil change, this car is worth the money i paid for it. i have a manual trans,sunroof, leather seats and power everything. 

the only thing that i don't like is that the passanger side does not have electric seats. but that's something that's not a big issue. i can honestly say that this car is worth every penny that i spent for it. and hopefully i never have to buy another car. i am in love with this car.

if i ever had to buy another car,it will be a honda accord and nothing else. <br><br>
