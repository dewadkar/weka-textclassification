            <b>Introduction</b>

I have waited for months for epinions to put this link for the Dodge Dakota 2001. Now it's here and thus I am here.  For graduation from College, I received a brand new, Dodge Dakota Quad Cab truck, and she is a beauty!

<b>The Truck</b>

Dodge really hit it big with this truck, especially with me.  I first saw the Dodge Dakota's back in 1995 and didn't really care for them.  However, their recent re-modeling (curves and arcs) is sweet.  As soon as I saw it I knew the I would like it.  When it came time to graduate, I went down to the dealership and picked out the specs that I desired in my machine.  One major factor was that it had to be Amber Fire (Metalic Dark Orange) and have dark interior.  I got both, plus a few extras.  For one, I loaded up on the Tire Package (part of the Sport Plus Pack).  This feature removes the standard wheels and tires and upgrades to 4 x 4 Wheels and tires.  It also includes heavier shocks and heavier axl!  In addition, I got the light group, which grants me fog lights, but dimmers and bed lights!  My truck was almost perfect, and lacked just 2 things, bed liner and flares, both of which were added in short order, thanks to Dodge and Rhino Liners!  

The truck itself stands, due to the tire package, the same height as the 4x4, and sits 5 comfortable, 6 with ease.  There is plenty of head room, tilt wheel, cruise, AC-Heat, Stereo by infinite, storage galore, dimming lights, Dual airbags, reinforced doors, and folding rear seats.  The best feature however is the drive, which is quite, dead quite except the drone of power of the truck itself.

My truck, being a Quad Cab, has 4 full sized doors, with child locks for the back. This only sacrifices 6 inches from the bed, which is fine.  I  still have a 6x5 bed and love it much.  If your in the market, check out Dodge and let a Dakota take you home!
