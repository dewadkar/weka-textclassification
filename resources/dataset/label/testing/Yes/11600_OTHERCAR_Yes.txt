            If you are looking for a SUV with plenty of power the Isuzu Rodeo should be your choice. The Rodeo comes with 3.2L engine, that outputs 205hp. This gives the Rodeo a lot of feel as if the engine should be in a sports car instead of a SUV. I test drove several SUV's before deciding on the Rodeo.
I drove the Dodge Durango, it is bigger but you do not feel the power like you do in the Rodeo. The Rodeo is not as plush as some of the SUV's, it has everything you really need. I choice the better sound system as one the choices.<br><br>
