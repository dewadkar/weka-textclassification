            This is my second Pontiac Minivan so I must like it...well, I do!  
I purchased the original in 1996 with my handicapped father in mind.  He had trouble getting in and out of cars but the Transport (as it was then called) made it easier for him.   He has since passed on but I found the vehicle was much more than just an easy entry vehicle.  
My husband and I have taken trips to Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, New York, and a few other places and the comfort of having so much room is the best of both worlds.   We usually take our 110-lb. German shepherd with us and he loves the space too.
The dual sliding doors on the 1999 Montana make it even more accessible and this time we opted for the standard size rather than the larger, extended minivan.  We have more than enough room for the three or us in our travels.  
I have been having trouble with my turn signals in the past few months and have had to take it in for service.  Now that the cold weather is here, they only work after the car has warmed up.  Other than this problem , I have had no others with this vehicle and I will buy another when the time comes.<br><br>
