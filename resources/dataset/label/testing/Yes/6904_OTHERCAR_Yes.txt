            I purchased a 1995 525ia in 1996 since it was the last production year for that model. I was able to save some dollars by purchasing the car for $32,000. One of the main reason I bought this car was for safety and it well worth it when a car ran a red light as I was making a protected left turn. The other vehicle smashed into the left passenger side by the rear wheel. I sustained no injuries and the car was driveable. The other driver in a Mitsubishi mirage did not do as well. He was taken away on an ambulance. I love the fact that I am able to get a smooth drive, looks, and personal safety from this car. After the repairs, the car still drives the same since it did not receive any engine damage. No strange noises or quirks. It was the best $32,000 I have ever spent. If you are into the BMW hype I'm sure you will buy it for whatever personal reason you have but I have to say that the safety is excellent and it is a thrill to drive. A person with excellent tastes, who does not have the luxury of purchasing a larger luxury car should consider this car. You get a good value all around and nothing beats safety.<br><br>
