            My father bought me my Shadow almost 5 months after my 16th birthday on March 5, 2000 for $1,200. It had approx. 135,000 miles and the paint was chipping very badly. The day we bought the car, we also had to buy a brand new battery for it. Then in mid-May, the ignition switch went. I had it replaced so now I have 2 seperate keys for my car: 1 for my doors & trunk and 1 for my ignition. In September 2000, my dad decided to get my car re-painted. Then in October for my 17th birthday, my dad bought me new tires. I have always kept my car in good condition. I get my oil changed every 3,000 miles and I try to wash my car every 2-3 weeks. I treat my interior with ArmorAll and my upholstery with Febreez. Overall, this has been the perfect car for me. My Little Shadow has 158,000 miles on it now. It's made a trip from Alabama to Pennsylvania and back and I also drove it here to Florida when we moved here in December. I just washed my car yesterday and I also replaced my wheel covers since the were very scratched and 1 was cracked. I love my Shadow and I couldn't imagine myself with any other car as my first car.
