            <B>OCT '02 UPDATE</B> It's been roughly one year and a half since my first review. My Pathfinder still runs great. I have had NO significant mechanical issues. There are a few new squeaks in the cabin but nothing irritating. It's aging beautifully!

I had a 1998 Pathfinder before this one. I was satisfied with everything except the weak engine. With the 2001 model, they've put in a 240hp powerhouse that finally rounds out this great vehicle.

I love the classic design of this SUV which hasn't changed in years. It's a handsome vehicle and the subtle changes they've made only improve upon a great base. It's not too big and obnoxious either.

On the interior, things are also pretty much the same as my 1998 model. The welcome improvements include the white faced guages, steering wheel stereo controls (yeah!), and automatic headlights. The guages are very easy to read. The steering wheel is leather wrapped and padded. Driving feels like a solid experience.

One little detail that this SUV has that I couldn't find in others was an in-dash 6 CD changer with a tape deck. I didn't think I'd find such a combination but it's available in the Pathfinder!

There are plenty of storage compartments throughout. The rear seats fold and recline. I know I can carry just about anything of reasonable size (including my dog).

The handling is good. I don't feel like I would tip over in an evasive maneuver. The brakes are firm and responsive. There's a little rattle now and then form inside the cabin. I wish traction control was an option.

The 2001 Pathfinder is a good all around SUV. If you are looking for the latest design and gadgets, search elsewhere.

P.S. The 2001 Pathfinder requires fuel that is 91 octane or better. Couple that with approx 16 mpg in the city and it's something to consider.
