            This was the first used car that I ever purchased, my husband and I were living in Hawaii and needed a second &quot;island&quot; car and this baby fit the bill.  

She was superbly taken care of and all receipts were saved so we knew this to be true.  I say this because I am very leary of used cars, but now I know they too can be a great investment.  It is a 1981 and it had 141,000 miles on it and still ran remarkably well, never trouble to start and still a bit peppy in it's old age.  It was quite nimble and able to squeak into even the smallest parking spot around.  At the time it was 15 years old and the only thing that had happened was that the vinyl in the back window had cracked from sun damage.  Even the motor in the moonroof was still working.  

I can't think of any drawback except that the new preludes look so much more sportier, and have better engines.  If you are looking for a great second car, or a first car for you child, I think the older Hondas are a great spot to start.<br><br>
