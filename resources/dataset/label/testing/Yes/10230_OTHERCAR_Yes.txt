            The Lexus RX-300 is a unique vehicle in an SUV field loaded with &quot;me-too&quot; knockoffs.  The RX-300 has the fit, finish, and feel of a carefully engineered car.  Its stability on the highway is exceptional even in heavy crosswinds or when big truck rigs pass at 70 mph.  The ride is exceptional for an SUV, akin to riding in the Lexus LS-300.  In this regard the RX-300 blows away the competition, particularly the Mercedes Benz ML SUV and the BMW SUV.  Both the M/B and the BMW have a harsh suspension (apparently loved by Europeans)... that makes the ride quite uncomfortable for long trips. In contrast the RX-300 was apparently designed for American tastes.  The suspension, although not &quot;cushy&quot; effectively subdues road bumps and makes for a really enjoyable ride both for passenger and the driver alike.  In my opinion, just enough &quot;road feel&quot; is transmitted through the suspension and steering wheel for the driver to have a &quot;feel&quot; for the road and a confident feeling of being in control of the vehicle.
The only negative I have found with the vehicle is that I wish the rear storage area was larger.  On some long trips stowing luggage and gear for three people has been a challenge, but then again some gear could be lashed down on the roof luggage carrier.
All in all, although I have owned two previous Lexus (LS-400 and LS-300), this RX-300 is the best value and the most fun to drive.  In about another year or so, I'll probably trade in for another RX-300!!
