Model CC15752 LS 3Door 6.5 FT Bed 
Light Pewter Met/Med Charcoal Gray
Med. Gray Custom Cloth

After owning a 1974 Chevy truck for some time I decided to buy my first new truck. I've driven Dodges from 1500-3500 with mixed feelings, Fords never appealed to me, and the new Toyota Tundra is good but a bit small in the rear seat area. (I could have got a deal on a Tundra as my wife works for Toyota)
The test drive alone sold The Truck, as I refer to it as. 3500 miles on it without the least of problems. Resting on past Chevrolet ownership,I hope to own this truck for its life time. 
The 5.3L engine has been faithful to 18.5 mpg, but rated at 16 city, 20 highway. The 285 HP and 325 TQ will haul down the road. With the added towing package and 3.73 rear axle gears, it will pull 8800 lbs. 
Asked if I would buy another one, the reply would be YES.
