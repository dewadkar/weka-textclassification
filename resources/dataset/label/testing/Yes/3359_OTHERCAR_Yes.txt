            I decided to purchase the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder LE 4WD as my 2nd car after Honda. Test drove Lexus RX and Acura MDX before hittind Path. (I know the price difference but still wanted a hang of the high priced SUV's)
The Path was way better and most of it way better in price target. The drive was very much like a car and handling was also excellent. The few points worth mentioning :

Price:
I got the Nissan Pathfinder LE AWD at a price of $29500, I negotiated with the dealer. The prices of the Nissan Pathfinders vary, also depending on the dealers. I had the price tag from carsdirect and stuck on that price. So the deal was done in less than 1 hour. Also got a nice deal from the dealer about servicing. 

$100 bought me a)3rd oil change free b)Inspection free (till i owe the car) c)10% of services
All that for the life of the car. 

Exterior:
The 2001 Nissan Pathfinder truly looks great, it's curved, and will be appealing to anyone who looks at it. The 2001 Nissan Pathfinder looks very similar to Infiniti. The 4 headlights really make it stand out. 
The ONLY real negative that i found was the radio antenna which is stand still. The dealer told me that 2001 does not have automatic antenna what a LIAR!! But not all the Path have automatic antenna so check it before you buy

Interior Styling:
The dash is very well laid. Most of the controls are easy and the best is the volume controls and track controls of CD on the steering. The back doors are small expecially if you have to put in a car seat with a kid in that. 

Engine:
This is one part of the vehicle, which truly amazes me in every aspect. It's a Nissan 240hp V6. The engine on the 2001 model is the most powerful V6 ever placed on an SUV. I was also amazed that the Nissan V6 240hp is more powerful than the engine on the much larger Lexus RX. The engine is truly incredible, it purrs and it adds great power to the vehicle. This engine is probably the best that I have ever seen. 

Brakes:
The Nissan Pathfinder has very strong brakes. No problems at all with handling in snow and bad weather. With 6" this time Path ran beautifully without and hickups. 

Sound:
The CD changer is a bit wierd. You have to get used to the loading of 1 cd at a time. the CDR does not work always so thats a big negative. most of them work but some are just not readable and CD player moves on to the next CD. 

Overall excellent value for money. The city miles are around 16-18 and highway is 18-21. You do not need premium gas but thats what I put anyways. gives a better performance and engine sound.
