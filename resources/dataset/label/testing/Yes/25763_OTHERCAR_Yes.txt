            You will get noticed in the New Beetle, no doubt about it.  I have had strangers wave at me and little kids point excitedly and tell their parents &quot;I want one!&quot;.   I've also seen kids beat the heck out of each other with the old &quot;Slug Bug&quot; gambit upon being the first to spot my &quot;bug&quot;.  Having had an old bug back in the '60's, I can assure you, not only does this car have heat AND air conditioning, it's FAST!  Even the non-turbo version will move when you need it to.  The engine is now in front, leaving a big, swing open hatch with fold down rear seats for lots of cargo.  It's tough, reliable, good on gas BUT.. dealers will still try to rip you off with add on's for color choice.  Wait a few weeks and the color/interior combo you want WILL be available.  Volkswagen is putting 31 BILLION into growing their product line and output. Both the Passat and the Beetle (which is based on the Golf hatchback chassis) are super cars.  Two caveats:  Do NOT pay over MSRP (we got ours at MSRP with a free six-disc CD changer)  and the cup holders are virtually useless.  They are too small and placed in the worst possible location (almost UNDER the dash)  Other than that, you'll be impressed with the roominess (yes, even for six footers) the ease of getting into the rear seats, the cool airfield red and blue dash lights and the reliability.  And you'll get a free flower vase and flower that, yes, mounts right on the dash.  ENJOY!<br><br>
