I've made a few observations after having the car for eight months:

- The tachometer is the primary gauge on the console since it's the largest of the three gauges and is in the middle; the speedometer is smaller and on the left side. When driving with my hands in any comfortable position besides 10-and-2, the speedometer is not visible to me because it's blocked by my arm. That's a very bad situation to be in, especially in a fast car that doesn't have cruise control. When driving on an empty road with no other cars to gauge my speed by, it's very easy to gradually speed up significantly in just a few minutes. I've gotten many, many tickets as a result (although, admittedly, some speeding was intentional. . .). 

- Several friends of mine have experience with mid-engine cars and all warned me when I first got my Spyder that it was important to not hit the brakes hard when in a turn. Even when keeping that in mind, I really didn't understand the impact until it happened to me once. Do everything possible to avoid stopping around a turn. :) 

- The difference in appearance with the top up and down is like day and night. It's pretty incredible how significantly the appearance changes and the amount of attention varies. Significant attention is virtually non-stop when the top is down, but effectively non-existent when the top is up. 

- I removed the spare tire from the front of my car (I'm pretty gutsy) to create some additional cargo space.  The problem that I've run into is that the latches on the top door that swings up to open are pretty poorly made.  I broke both of mine during normal use within a few months.
