            Last month we considered buying a Kia.  My mother wanted an SUV, and she needed a daily driver anyway, so the Kia Sportage seemed like the perfect compromise.  Maybe not.

The model we drove for approximately a week and 500 miles was a burgundy 2001, 2WD, with automatic.  It made a very pretty vehicle.  I have always thought that the four door Sportages were classy looking and look just as good, if not better, than some of the pricier SUVs.  Interior was not too bad - very basic, nothing luxurious, no extras.  The inside door handles did look very cheap, and I suspect they would not have been too long in breaking.  Ditto for the pop out cup holder.  The doors had to be slammed shut, or they would not close all the way.  That got annoying quick.  Seats and other plastic fittings and trim felt solid, however, like they would last a while.  Backseat was higher than the front, which made for an interesting view and I found myself with plenty of headroom while riding in the back, though not much leg room.  

It felt a bit underpowered; acceleration was tolerable, but it makes me wonder how underpowered it will feel when the engine actually gets some wear on it.  A standard transmission may be a peppier choice in this vehicle.  Air conditioner was a disappointment - it did get cold, but it took it about ten minutes to cool the interior of the vehicle completely, and the output of the fans was very weak.  By contrast, my 1998 4 cylinder Cavalier will freeze you out after just a few minutes of its A/C.  Opening the rear hatch was rather inconvenient, as well as non-intuitive.  It opens with a key only, which means you can't, unless you're carrying an extra key, leave the vehicle running and hop out to put something in the back.

My mother is a great fan of SUVs and she enjoyed driving it very much.  I hated it.  Visibility was poor when looking over the left shoulder.  Stopping distance seemed horribly long, and at one point when I had to brake sudden and hard, I had the disconcerting feeling that the vehicle was going to stand on its nose.  It did feel a little unstable on the curves, but not terribly so.  While it was fun to drive for a couple of days, commuting every day in it would have grown to become a chore.

It's hard to rate this in black and white - I didn't care for it for various reasons, and while some might accuse it of being a cheap or chintzy vehicle, one must take the price and class into consideration.  We aren't talking about a top of the line Explorer here, we're talking about a Kia.  To tell you the truth, we took a peek at the Chevrolet Trackers, and they looked a lot cheaper than the Kia as far as interior and body styling go.  I would recommend the Sportage for someone who wants an SUV just because they like the feeling of driving an SUV, but who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on purchase price or in gas.  The 10 year powertrain warranty also provides some peace of mind.
