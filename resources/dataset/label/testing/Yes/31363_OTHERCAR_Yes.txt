            I love the car! It is more car for the buck!  If you can, I recommend spending a little more and buying a GTS.  (Please, don't get me wrong!  The 2001 GT is still a capable car as well!).

This car came with leather seats, sunroof and the Action Package.  If you haven't seen it check it out!  It definitely improves on the aggressive appearance of an already beautiful machine. 

It pays to own the 2002 and it looks like Toyota addressed our complaints regarding the quality of the paint and some of the materials, since I can tell that the quality was updated to conform to their strict quality standards. 

Also, that sixth gear is a blessing!  It just quiets down engine noise.  That sixth gear was missing from the GT model and the noise was considerably higher.   

Lastly,  I haven't seen paint chips (on the GT chips surfaced after the first week of ownership).
