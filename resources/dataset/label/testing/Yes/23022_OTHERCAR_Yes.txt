            I bought this camera for $250 about a year ago.  It came with the cord to attach it to your computer, the software, a 4MB card AND the coolest gadget of all a Disk adapter.  The disk adapter allows you to take the card from the camera, insert it into the adapter and then just insert it in your floppy drive.  Yup, no more trying to plug the camera into your computer to download the pics.  Just insert a disk.  It also came with a power cord for the camera to save on batteries.  I bought this for my online auction and have been extremely pleased.  No, it doesn't take perfect pictures like those disc digitals but hey, it was only $250 and now they are even cheaper.  I also bought a 8MB extra card which I still have not had to use.  The camera also has a switch which you can change for close up pics and far away pics.  You can also change the resolution to fit more pics on the card, though this tends to reduce the quality of the image.  This is a great camera for those who just want a digital camera without spending tons of money.  <br><br>
