            This van is a 2000 Dodge Ram Wagon, 8 passenger model, heavy duty suspension.  We wanted a full size van because we travel a lot and like to camp out on our trips.  This van is great for overnight camping trips.

With 3 boys under 11, this van is great for the room it provides.  Plenty of room for the 5 of us, plus LOTS of room in the back for all of the &quot;stuff&quot; we bring with us.  Suitcases, ice chests, camping equipment, etc. fit with NO problem.  We don't have to stash things under the seats to make it all fit.  The seats are comfortable and roomy too.  Lots of room for all 3 boys to spread out with all the assorted paraphenalia that goes with travelling with kids.  We took this van back to Texas (from California) for a two week trip in Nov./Dec. and had a really great time.  I love the comfort and all the room of this van.

It drives very nicely too.  Good pickup when you're getting on the freeways (which kind of surprised me because of how big this van is).  Kind of stiff on dirt roads and such because we did get the heavy duty suspension, but we had expected that.

Gas mileage is not wonderful (10-13 in city driving and 13-18 in highway driving) but we expected that also.  Plus with a 35 gallon gas tank, this is not really a problem.

One thing I don't like is when the windows are open anywhere in the van, the wind noise is pretty loud.  Also when the front windows are open any amount (driver and passenger side), the wind blows right into your face.  I think Dodge could have done something about that.  Also there's not a lot of cupholders (not really a BIG problem, just an irritation).  There are two up front and only one in the middle seat (just behind the driver's seat).

This is a great family van.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes to travel.  Its really great for around town too.  Its kind of hard to park because of its size, but visibility is so good all around the whole van so I don't have any problem seeing what I'm doing.

Added 8/1/2000 - We've owned this van for about 10 months now.  We still like the ride, still like the room, still like the comfort.  Of course, with gas prices being what they are, I'm not really thrilled with the gas mileage right now, but as I said above, we knew what we were getting into when we bought the van.

We have had it at the dealer's for two things mainly (besides the usual servicing):  1) they had to fix the weather stripping around the driver's side door 3 times, I think that was more of a problem with the dealer, not the manufacturer.  The weather stripping is still holding since the last time they fixed it - about 2 weeks ago - but I'm still not real trustful of it.  I've also had the radio/tape player replaced twice.  I'm REALLY irritated about that.  Just the tape player goes out.  Supposedly because we shouldn't be playing tapes when we ride on dirt roads (which we have to drive on to get to our home).  I think this is just a cheap stereo.  I've been told that if I want to upgrade to a better stereo, I will have to pay for it and it won't be covered under our original warranty.  I think this is very cheap of Dodge (as well as the lack of decent cupholders), but as long as they want to replace the cheap little stereo, as long as the van is under warranty, that's what I'll have to do.  I really wish Dodge had put in a better tape player.

I also wanted to add that this van is pretty high off the ground, so it is not real easy to get in and out of (part of that is no handles to hold on to, part is that with the heavy duty suspension, the van is higher off the ground than an average van).  We still rate this van pretty high for anyone looking for a full size van.
