            I bought my Ford Escort as a new car in 1993.  I have the LX station wagon model and it fits my needs quite well.  This car does not have any fancy additions like power locks or windows but that is okay with me.  It does have power steering and power brakes.  It also has power seatbelts, but no air bags.  I have an automatic transmission on my car.

My 7 year old Escort still gets reasonably good gas milage (about 30 mpg) and for a small car it drives nicely.  It does not accelerate very quickly, but it gets the job done.  If I have to pull out into traffic, it accelerates fast enough to get me into the lane without causing a traffic jam.

The interior of this car is somewhat small.  The front seat is just right for me, but, I'm only 5 foot 3 inches tall.  When my husband drives this car (he's 6 foot 2 inches), even with the seat adjusted to the furthest back position, he is a little cramped, but, he can drive it in a pinch.  Don't try to put adults in the back seat of this car.  It will be awful squishy!!  Kids fit fine, though.

One thing that I especially like about the Escort station wagon is all the cargo space in the rear.  I can fit my baby's stroller (it is big) along with all the groceries and then some.  If I have extra large items, the back seats fold down for extra room.  In addition, there is a cover for the cargo area which works like a window shade and hooks on the back so that everyone cannot look to see what you are toting around.

This car has needed very little work done on it other than routine maintenance.  The one major thing that it did need was a transmission fluid pump which had been leaking.  This happened early on and was totally covered under warranty.  Other than the inconvenience of not having my car for a few days, it cost me nothing to get repaired.

Overall, the Escort is a good little car.  Remember that it is little.  I've had it for 7 years now and it's been good for me.
