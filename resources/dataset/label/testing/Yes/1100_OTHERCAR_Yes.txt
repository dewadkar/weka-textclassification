             This purchase was a rush decision - it was Thursday, work started on Monday, and I had to have wheels by then. Not my preferred way of making a purchase but in this case it worked out really well. 

 I bought it from a neighbor (well - same street but two miles away) as a six year old car, shiny, well maintained, and running smoothly apart from a noisy valve starting from cold that quieted after a few seconds. Even that niggle went away after two oil changes with synthetic oil. 

 For four months it took me to the far side of town (twenty miles each way) with no problems at all. Then I got a job in Dallas, and for the next four months, was driving between eight hundred and a thousand miles a week. Now i have put about fifty thousand miles on this car, and have made one emergency repair - the fuse for the fuel pump (electric on this model) blew. Fortunately I rolled to a stop outside Western Auto, was able to isolate the problem, and a couple of dollars and a few minutes later i was on my way. I wish I could say the same about my wife's newer and much more expensive (American-badged Japanese) car!

 As far as driving goes, it is a delight. 30+ MPG on regular gas is very welcome, and the manufacturer's 7,500 mile oil change interval means you do not have to panic if you slide past 3000 miles. The Fox is no sports car, especially now it has well over 100K miles on the clock, but the engine is lively enough, still well able to earn you all the speeding tickets you will ever want to pay. Handling is light and precise, and when driven hard, goes into an easily controlled slide. it's a bit noisy, wind and engine noise being noticeable at speed, but it is far from excessive. 

 The only criticism I have about the Fox as an owner driver is the durability of the plastic parts. It seems that after about eight years they get soft and fail. Whether this is caused by ultra violet light or heat (in Texas there is a good supply of both) I do not know, but in the last couple of years, the gaiter on the gear lever shredded (did i mention it has a delightful regular transmission?), both sun visors fell off, the door pocket cracked on the driver's side when the door blew against my leg one day, and the plastic parts of the dipstick disintegrated. But for a ten year old car, i do not think that is excessive.

 All in all, this Fox has been an excellent buy. When it is time for my next car, you  can bet a VW will be right up there in the short list.<br><br>
