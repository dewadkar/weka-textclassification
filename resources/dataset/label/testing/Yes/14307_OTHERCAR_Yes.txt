            This is my first review of anything ever on this site
Honestly, I like my car so much I felt the need to go off on a rant about it, so here goes.

I have kind of a soft spot for the Sentra SE-R.  The first car I ever drove was my friend's classic '92 SE-R, it also happens to be the one I learned to drive stick on.  So I am a little biased in addition to the fact that I actually have the car.  Now on to the actual review.

MECHANICAL: The car comes with a 2.5l dual overhead cam 16 valve engine with continuously variable timing control, CVTC.  It's kind of like vtec but continuous so it's not an absolute dog under 5000rpm.  Specs are 175hp and 180lb/ft torque with a 6250rpm redline.  For those saying it only makes ~140hp, the drivetrain does suck up quite a bit of power.  The HLSD, the heavy duty Maxima trans (the flywheel alone weighs ~25-30lbs), and the big 17in wheels weigh ~23-25lbs so thats alot of mass to get turning.  Small economy cars usually don't have all this stuff so taking all this into account, the drivetrain loss is not surprising.  This is the engine out of the base Altima, in that car, it is very quiet, but when stuffed in the much smaller and lighter Sentra, it can get considerably louder (it's my dad's biggest complaint).  The transmission choice is only a 6spd manual (weeds the men out from the boys, my girlfriend's saying) taken out of the new 6spd Maxima SE.  In my opinion, it's very precise, but not very smooth, once the car is broken in, it's not a problem.  The brakes are 4 wheel discs with optional ABS.  They are good enough to simply slam your passengers hard into their seatbelts and take a lot of abuse before they begin to fade slightly.

INTERIOR: The most glaring aspect of the interior is that the seats are very red with a strange fishnet stocking looking material covering the sides with zippers too on the back.  To many it is a huge turn off to the car, but since I've had it they have grown on me and people are surprised that they came from the factory like that.  I have not gotten a single negative comment on them yet.  Anyways, you're supposed to sit in them so you don't see them anyways.  They do a great job of holding you in place during "spirited" driving, my friend complained of a wedgie after slamming on the brakes once so if that doesn't say something about them I don't know what does.  I've heard they are from a Skyline, not the GTR but one of them.  Everything else is pretty normal for a economy car.  The dash is covered in hard black plastic as are the armrests (which happens to be one of my few complaints).

EXTERIOR: It looks pretty much like a regular Sentra.  It has a different front fascia with a "skyline inspired" bumper, mesh grille, and a big set of foglights.  It also has a set of 17in wheels with low profile Z rated high performance tires.  On the trunklid is quite possibly the biggest R I've ever seen on a production car.  My problem with that is, anything with an R badge on a car is destined to be discourteously pried off with a screwdriver wreaking havoc on your paint and clearcoat.  The rest is the same as a Sentra G/XE.

PERFORMANCE: Anyone who complains that this car is not as fast as they thought it would be is not expecting the right things from it.  This car was made for the autocross.  With its torque, helical limited slip diff, stiff suspension, and close ratio transmission, its a performer off the dealer's lot.  This is not saying it's slow in a straight line, it's far from that.  I'm just saying it was not meant to be a drag racer (no 4 cyl fwd car should be in my opinion).  My one complaint in this category is the massive torque steer.  Standing on the gas out of turns, it's hard to keep going the way you're pointing it.  Once you get used to it though, it's easy to just rocket out of corners like no front wheel drive car should.

AUDIO: Once again, anyone who complains about the 300 watt 9 (really 7) speaker audio package got too caught up in the hype of this car.  No it's not completely Rockford Fosgate components, it's all part of Nissan's "shady" advertising.  If you look at the advertisements, they say "Rockford Fosgate powered" that means the only RF stuff is the amp, maybe the subwoofer, I haven't figured it out yet.  Overall it sounds pretty good, much better than the average car's audio.  The bass isn't going to rattle windows on other cars, which is probably what people were looking for, but it certainly is not bad.

MILEAGE: I personally have gotten anywhere from about 19-27mpg, on average around 24 in mostly city driving.  I can usually go a little less that 250 miles on a tank (13.2 gal.) before I need to fill up.  I don't drive like a madman, but I do get on it every once in a while and thats when I swear I can see the fuel needle dropping in front of my eyes.  The car does use premium fuel though and that ends up costing more, but it's not much of a difference.

OPTIONS: The Spec V comes with pretty much everything most people will need.  The options are:
-ABS/Side airbag package~$750
-Sunroof package~$700 inlcludes lighted vanity mirrors
-Audio Fanatic Package~$550 300watt "Rockford Fosgate" audio system and immobilizer security system (computer chipped keys)
-In Dash 6-cd changer~$400 adds changer to standard single disc player (total discs=7) having stuff in cupholders gets in the way of slot and buttons, a bad thing is that the main controls at the top of the dash do not control the changer, you must reach past the shifter to the very bottom of the center console.
-Floor mats~80 not the "floormats" of death that came with my car, the new ones have a notch where they reach the gas pedal so it does not get stuck (definately a good thing)
-In cabin microfilter-don't remember price
That's pretty much it, those are all the options my car has and I don't think I forgot any.  My tip is if you want all out performance, don't get any options, they mostly add weight, especially the sunroof and audio system.

OVERALL: I feel this car's value can't be beat by a new car.  Before I bought the car, I drove just about every car in it's price range, and a few that were not
here's a list of cars and why I didn't buy them(hope I don't offend anyone's cars)

-Acura RSX type S-snobby dealers (I don't care if it has an Acura badge, it's still a civic)
-Ford SVT Focus-dealer wouldn't let me test drive it without filling out paperwork, personal past Ford issues
-Honda Accord-just for the heck of it
-Honda Civic-needs at least 30 more hp
-Honda Prelude-being discontinued, kinda heavy
-Honda S2000-they had one, so I drove it
-Mazda MP3-see Civic, incredible handling though
-Mitsubishi Eclipse-felt like a barge
-Mitsubishi Lancer O.Z.-didn't find a single thing I liked
-Nissan Altima 2.5s-my dad wanted me to get it, too big and soft
-Nissan Frontier S/C-only not slow anymore
-Nissan Maxima SE 6spd-just felt like it
-Subaru WRX-what else can I say, turbo+AWD+dirtroad=big stupid smile, I can hardly imagine the Japanese spec WRX
-Toyota Camry-quite possibly the most boring car I've ever driven, even with the 5spd
-Toyota Celica GT-overpriced with too many options, $23k for 140hp and steel wheels??? I won't even mention how much the GT-S was
-VW GTI 1.8t-didn't want a long term car with a turbo
-VW Beetle Turbo-just for the heck of it

I basically had my sights set on the RSX S but the dealer would not budge on the price (Maybe it had something to do with the fact me and my dad showed up in his ugly and dirty work truck instead of his 540i, I'm convinced it would have made a difference but he wasn't, oh well).  After that I heard that the new SE-R's had finally hit the showrooms, I quickly headed for my friend's father's Nissan dealership in hope of a test drive.  Well I got my wish, the first Spec V they got in was rolling off the truck.  I was the first one to actually drive it after it was prepped (being the friend of the owner's son has it's perks).  The test drive was great, it's power surprised me, it spun the tires into 2nd gear without even trying.  I took it through some turns, not incredibly fast but fast enough to make my friends in the back seat and the salesman in the front hold on to whatever they could.  It just stuck to the road like no other front wheel drive car I've ever driven (bar the MP3 and I haven't driven an Integra Type R yet).  Well after the test drive, I was hooked, I called up my dad and I ordered a loaded blackout Spec V that day (I wasn't about to buy the one the dealership was going to use as the "beater").  So far I have had no major problems, only the minor few like strange rev limiter at 2800rpm for about an hour and the floormat of death recall(gas pedal got stuck under floormat).  I've loved every minute of having this car and find myself finding excuses just to go out and drive it.  It's not for everyone though.  If you want a soft and quiet ride, run as far away from this car as you can, I would recommend the Altima it's ok with the 4cyl, with the v6 it's sick for a "sedate" family sedan and feels as fast as my dad's BMW 540i.  Anyways, I have every option you can get and I paid about 18,000 after everything, nothing on the market I drove comes anywhere close so I strongly recommend it to anyone who values all around performance.
