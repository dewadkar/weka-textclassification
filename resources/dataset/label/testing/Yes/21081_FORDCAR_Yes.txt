            My Windstar .... MY WINDSTAR! Can you believe I didn't even WANT a minivan? I couldn't STAND the stereotypical idea that everyone who drove a van was a married, nursing mother, who had nothing better to do with her life than haul around at LEAST a dozen kids! 

GRANTED I AM married, WAS a nursing mother, and actually had a LOT better things to do than haul around everyone's kids! But when my husband, Eric, surprised me with the Windstar, my first reaction was &quot;Oh. A van.&quot; 

I always saw myself as the recreational vehicle type and a minivan just wasn't my cup of tea. But upon placing my bottom end into the FABULOUSLY comfortable leather seat and grasping the wheel ... I was sold. Hook line and sinker ... Ford had me. 

I never wanted to leave it. I stand a cozy 5'4&quot; tall ... my husband soars to 6'3&quot;. Until the Windstar, we had never had a vehicle we were BOTH comfortable in. The leg room is amazing! Even when Eric is pushed back all the way in the drivers seat, there is still plenty of room to board behind him.

My van has the <b>automatic dual sliding doors</b> as well. I've found that only the one on the drivers side is ever used except when I'm hauling adults responsible enough not to bound out the door into traffic. Therefore, if I could do it over again, I wouldn't have ordered the dual automatic doors ... but the one on the drivers side is a LIFESAVER in rainy weather and trips to the grocery store!

The rear storage compartment isn't TOO terribly large, but it IS deep. You'd be amazed how much stuff you and squeeze into it.  Too, when we travel, I find that there is LOTS of room UNDER the seats for smaller items that take up space!  

Now let me tell you about cup-holders. You want cup-holders? The Windstar has a PLETHERA of cup-holders! There are FOUR in the rear seat area alone!  The middle seats have three, and there are three also in the driver/passenger area.  That's ten cup-holders for a seven passenger vehicle ... Ford doesn't expect you to haul around camels!

Overhead there is a convenient coin holder, sunglass holder, garage door opener compartment (complete with velcro), a &quot;mommy mirror&quot; (for spying on the kids in the back), and controls for the dual sliding door.

On the drivers side visor there is a handy little system called &quot;Home Link Universal Transceiver&quot; ... by using it, I can program the three buttons to open my garage door, turn on the lights on the front porch, or control anything else that operates by a transceiver. It's a VERY handy little system and another one of those things I can't remember what it was like before I had it!

The seats are VERY comfortable, the heating and air conditioners (dual) are fantastic and distribute &quot;instant comfort&quot; evenly and to just the right temperature!  And the stereo system is unrivaled ... Eric and I can listen to Classical Music from CD in the front, while the kids can plug in headphones and listen to THEIR favorite music. It's a DREAM for long trips!

Our van also came with a Reverse Sensor which tells me when there is something behind me! How did I EVER live without this little handy device? I can't TELL you how many &quot;kid toys&quot; on the driveway have been saved thanks to this little gadget. It will begin with a slow beep and gradually build up to a steady BEEEEEEEEEP if you're about to hit something. 

On the other hand, if you're annoyed by beeping, this van will drive you NUTS with it's constant beeping warnings! It warns me when my gas is low. It warns me when my lights are on! It warns me about oil changes. And no matter how many times you hit the &quot;reset&quot; (or the &quot;I HEAR YOU ALREADY!&quot; button), it relentlessly aggrevates you till you DO something OTHER than hitting &quot;reset&quot;. My husband and I affectionately call it the 'DoomsDay System'.

Too, resetting the computerized &quot;oil&quot; gage can send you into fits, and heaven HELP you if your directions screw up on your electronic compass (parking garages ALWAYS mix my compass up)! I'm VERY computer literate and I can TELL you, this is my ONLY major frustration with the Windstar! The electronics package needs to be a bit more user friendly! Aaaarrrgghh!

Overall, despite my love/hate relationship with the computer system, I LOVE this Van. I would recommend it to ANYONE!!!<br><br>
