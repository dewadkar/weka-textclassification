            I had my doubts when it came to buying a Ford product.  I myself am a Chevy person.  But, I had a Chevy S-10 Blazer 4x4 and was VERY dissatisfied with it.  Many trips to the shop.  

I couldn't make up my mind on whether to buy a Ford or another Chevy product.  I drove them all.  But have to say that the Ford Expedition handled and rode the best of them all. I also found that the Ford Expedition had more room than the Chevy SUV.

To date i have had NO mechanical problems with my Ford Expedition, would recommend it to anyone that was looking for a larger SUV.  The people i would not recommend to buy this vehicle are the ones that have never drove a large vehicle before.  The expedition is so big that it might intimidate those who are used to smaller vehicles.<br><br>
