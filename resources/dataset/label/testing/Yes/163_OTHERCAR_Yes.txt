            I was initially attracted to this camera when shopping for a versatile and affordable digital camera on the internet. I found a website that raved about it and described it in detail. That and its under $300. price tag sold me...and I haven't felt dissappointed at all! In fact each time I use this camera it amazes me more that its able to get so much done and yet is about the size of your average instamatic! A basic Adobe picture processing disc, a cable and a smart media card were included in the $248. price tag. Not included is the essential 5V AC adapter (essential unless you want to keep feeding the camera AA batteries until you go broke!) which is apparently very hard to purchase from anyone other than Fuji, who asks a stiff $25.-$30. (A local camera man mentioned to me that you could use a much more common 4.9V or a 6V adapter-frequently available at thrift stores- safely instead. I've been using a 6V for quite awhile now with excellent results. Just make sure the polarity's correct...+ in the center). The picture quality with this little camera is what amazes me most. I'm new to digital photography so I was initially skeptical. But the astounding detail and color, along with digital convenience has got me feeling great about the digital future...and this great, diminutive camera.<br><br>
