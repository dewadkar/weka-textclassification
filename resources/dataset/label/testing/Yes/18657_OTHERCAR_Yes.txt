            We just bought a 2002 Honda Odyssey, after waiting a mere three weeks. I am told this is an incredibly short wait - and not just by the sales person either :-)

We were looking for a flexible van, loaded with features and a DVD entertainment system. The Honda Odyssey is it for us.

<b>Seating Configuration(s)</b>
We wanted seats that could be easily shifted around in the back, and preferably with four captain's chairs. The Honda has this. You can shift the passenger side, second-row seat over next to the driver-side seat to form a bench, or you can leave it where it is. Either way, there is plenty of room to walk to the bench in the back. 

The back bench is a major feature. It folds flat into the floor if you need storage space to haul stuff. This is so much easier than getting a bench out of the car - something which would require about eight of me huffing and puffing.
Although it is still a bit heavy, it's nothing compared to getting the seat out of the van. Plus, if you travel on vacation, you'll still have those extra seats in the back when you reach your destination and take the luggage out.

When the back bench is not folded away you will find that the baggage space is still pretty good. There is an indentation in the floor (where the seat goes). This is nice and keeps your groceries from rolling all over the car when (and not if) your bags tip over. The hooks on the back of the bench are nice also and help minimize the rolling grocery problem.

The seats in the DVD-model come leather as standard. I would have happily done without the leather, but that is not an option. The two front seats have heating. Toasty.

<b>DVD-system</b>
This is a nice feature. Especially if you travel with kids. My toddler loves to ride in this van (and he normally isn't crazy about longer drives). With a Disney on the screen he's happy as a clam, even for driving a few hours. Normally his tolerance is spent after 45 minutes. Really a huge deal for me!

The system comes with a remote and two sets of wireless headphones. This means that the unit can be controlled from the back, and that the people in the front do not have to listen to whatever movie they are watching in the back. If you have more than two people watching in the back, you can let the movie sound come through the regular speakers in the car. Very flexible. I appreciate not having to listen to Barney for an hour and a half.

Unfortunately you have to choose between the really nifty Honda Navigational system and the DVD. You cannot have both. I thought this was a real shame, as I wanted both. The Honda Navi-system is built into the dash with a color touch screen, so you can't get a comparable one by after-installing it. Shucks.

<b>The little things</b>
Part of what makes this a great car are all the little things: Cupholders everywhere, a fold-away table between the front seats that extends backwards to the second row. CD and tapedeck and radio (which can be used independently on the speakers and wireless headsets in the back, so you listen to the radio and the kids listen to N'sync on CD THROUGH THE HEADPHONES!! A blessing). I would have liked a little more interior storage space, alas...

<b>Does it drive well?</b>
Yes it does. It handles like a car, and not like the large vehicle it is. It has nice acceleration for a van, and brakes real well. Fuel economy reflects that this is a large heavy van, but does all right at that.

<b>Doors</b>
The van has power sliding doors on both sides, which can be opened with a button next to the steering wheel, with the remote or by tugging on the door handles. Doors won't open unless car is in Park. This is a bit weird at first, especially if you are dropping someone curbside. You get used to it though, and it turns out to be a great feature, especially if you have kids on your arm or your hands full of groceries.

<b>Overall</b>
Overall this is an excellent car and we love it! It is comfortable, silent and handles well. My son keeps asking to go watch movies in the garage. Of all the vans we looked at to decide, this was a clear winner. None of the others came close. AND it has that magic seat....
