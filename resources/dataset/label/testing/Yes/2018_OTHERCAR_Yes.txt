            I recently purchased a brand new 2002 Old Alero GLS and I couldn't be happier.  I got my model loaded with all the options including 6-way power driver's seat, power sunroof, and leather seats.  I did a lot of research before buying the Alero and also strongly considered a Pontiac Grand Am (also a nice car but didn't drive quite as smoothly as the Alero in my opinion) and a Mitsubishi Eclipse (nice but too cramped for my liking).  

The Alero seemed to be everything I was looking for and at a very reasonable price.

My model is a 2 door, black with silver trim (there's an option to get Gold trim/emblems for an extra couple hundred bucks but I don't like the color gold), with pewter leather interior, a power sunroof, a rear decklid spoiler, and 16" Aluminum wheels.  Everything except the sunroof came standard on the GLS model.  Let me just say that the car looks spectacular.  Sporty and stylish without being flashy or gaudy.  It has sort of a "natural beauty" where it looks good without trying to look good like some of the other flashier sporty compact cars.  www.alero.com has some nice photos if you click on the 'Styling' link

As for the inside of the car, mine came with leather seats which I absolutely adore.  Not only to they look slick, they're remarkabley comfortable to ride in.  The interior of the car, while not huge, is far from cramped.  It can easily seat 4 comfortably.  It could seat 5 with no problems as well but it might get uncomfortable on long trips.
