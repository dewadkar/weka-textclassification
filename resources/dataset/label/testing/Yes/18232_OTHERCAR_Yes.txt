            Welcome all!

I have been the proud owner of five Volvos!  I may only be 18 years of age, but I do know my Volvos.  Today, I will tell you about the only limited production Volvo 850 ever made, the 1995 850 T-5R.  

Only 2,500 T-5R were ever made, and only in Yellow and Black (mostly yellow).  The car came with 240HP without any upgrades (the Turbo model has only 222HP), and an amazing 300+ FT/LBS of torque!  This car was built only to try and change the Volvo 'boxy' image.  And some would say the 'slow' image as well - I've never seen a slow Volvo.

My T-5R is heavily upgraded. The upgrades include the euro-style side lamps, anti-sway bars, sport exhaust, high-speed chip, among many other little things.  The estimated power output is now around 300HP, and the torque is probably around 350 FT/LBS (which means I can peel out in this front wheel drive regardless of the 205/45R17 Perreli tires-which are gonna go next.

Okay, okay, you see the power...what about comfort and quality?

This is the best Volvo in regards to comfort. The seats gently hug you, sometimes I forget about ever being inside the car. The radio is top-notch, the sound is great, and reception with the 'legendary' Volvo electric antanae (spell?? -- Volvo has used electric antanae as standard equipment since the seventies, maybe earlier...). 

In my thoughts of quality, I would have to admit that the quality of the 240 seemed to be much higher than the 850. Then again, I've never had a problem with the 850. Of course, the only problems I have EVER incountered in a Volvo is the electrical harnesses under the hood (big deal...it took me fifteen minutes to fix, did Consumer Reports really have to knock the '94 Volvo 850 to the not-to-buy list?).  

In conclusion, I would have to say that I am too tired to write very well, and that the Volvo 850 T-5R is a wonderful car, even though it doesn't have many extra features aside from the normal 850 Turbo.  I would reccommend it to everyone, but not everyone can have one...only a few exist.  So HA! <br><br>
