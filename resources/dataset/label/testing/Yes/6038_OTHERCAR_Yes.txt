            In 2000, my wife and I began looking for another car to replace our ailing 1988 Mitsubishi Cordia and stumbled across the Saturn L wagon.  We knew we wanted a wagon, but I don't fit in the Subaru's, I hate the styling of the Taurus and refuse to pay the kind of money Saab, Volvo, Audi and BMW want for their wagons.  Thus we were very limited in our choices.  After looking around, we decided to stop by the Saturn dealer and at least look at what they offered.  This was the first year of the LW series and the last place we looked.  I was immediately struck by how really nice looking the Saturn can be with the windows tinted and nice 17" rims.  I love the look of the Audi and I thought the LW looked just as sharp, once it had the simple add-ons of rims and tinting.  The factory stereo was surprisingly good (I have plenty-o' audio knowledge) and the leather interior was a nicely done, though I still prefer cloth.  Even though the entry model had a 4-cyl. engine, it was adequate to get the car moving with a mild sense of urgency.  Braking was great, steering was neutral and the suspension was a perfect compromise for a wagon.  Ultimately, we had to go with a less expensive used sedan (which I don't fit in) but knew we really wanted an LW.  Move forward to Dec. 2001 and our second car (1973 BMW 2002) gave out on me.  We had to buy something and all the old conditions were still true.  We went to a couple of used car dealers, were very disappointed with the choices available and then went to the Saturn dealer to buy a Wagon.  Financing was great, they had an LW200 in the right color & trim, and after forcing the dealer to replace the Firestone tires with Goodyears (at no charge) we drove our new LW200 home.  I have been completely happy with the purchase and it is 3 months old now.  We will see how things develop, but this car is everything I wanted and expected.  Roomy, comfortable, economical on gas and is rated well in terms of safety.  It costs about $4000 less than the nearest comparable wagon and has styling that I like very much.  I have seen reviews referring to buzziness in the engine and creaky panels or moulding, but I can tell you that all those problems have been addressed and the car looks, sounds and feels very solid.  The buzzy engine was addressed with a well executed counterbalancing shaft and I have had people ask if the 2.2 liter 4 cyl. was a V-6 because it pulls very strong from a stop light.  The center console rear portion doesn't feel as solid as some of the other interior pieces, but considering how huge the storage space is in there, I am not wiling to complain about it.  The glove box is huge and the counterweighted door feels super light.  I like having the window switches in the console as they are all accessible from the passenger seat (which is good because we plan on having kids soon) and the power lock buttons are very comfortably reached.  We got the car for $20k but added on the Saturn maintenance plan which includes engine/transmission oil changes and the 30,000 mile service, because I am just tired of doing all the maintenance on 3 cars.  For the person who wants a good, solid, middle of the road wagon with lots of room that you will be happy to drive anywhere, this is the car for you. 

Update: I have now had the car for almost 1.5 yrs and it is still going strong.  Comments about the 2001 models having body panels or mouldings possibly starting to make noise would'nt apply to our 2002.  Everything is still nice and tight with none of the engine buzziness that plagues the 2001 model.  There was one ECU update notice we received during the first year of ownership, but we took it in on a Friday morning and picked it up that evening after work to get the software update.  The Saturn maintenance plan is well worth it.  I love being able to just drop the car off for routine maintenance with no worries about paying for the work being done.  The only "problem" we have had was a burned out tail lamp that was replaced free of charge.  Lastly, the only minor complaint I would have is that when you put the rear seats down, the don't fold COMPLETELY flat (weight on the backs flattens them down for the most part) and you have a metal "bar" at the top of the seat back (because of the split seat) that can be scratched by things drug across it.  I am thinking of getting some kind of plastic cover to protect the bar, since I have been hauling much more stuff as of late.  Overall, I am still totally happy with the purchase.  We bought the car with specific needs in mind and we got exactly what we hoped for.  An affordable, reliable, well built, attractive wagon.
