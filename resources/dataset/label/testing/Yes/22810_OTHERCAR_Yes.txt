            What a perfect automobile!  This SUV combines the luxury of other Cadillac vehicles with the offroad capacity of other Sports Utility Vehicles.  This mix is simply perfect for all family members who need to haul more than just 2 people.  This SUV has plenty of room for carrying almost anything, and greater pickup than all other SUVs in it's class.  Not only does it have the luxury and offroad package to its advantage, but it has such an amazing exterior body style and not to mention the comfortable roomy interrior.  I cannot think of many potential downfalls to the automobile except for the fact that it is a little pricy.  Otherwise, I would recommend it to everyone who can afford it.<br><br>
