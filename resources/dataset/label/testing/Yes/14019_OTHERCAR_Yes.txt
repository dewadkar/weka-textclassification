            I bought this vehicle in an emergency situation. (my 10 year old Plymouth had exploded several days before) My parents had recommended a salesperson that they knew was trustworthy, and he sold Pontiacs. The Sunfire was within my price range, and I had a wide variety of styles and colors to choose from on the lot. I chose a teal 4 door automatic. 

There was a '97 program car on the lot with a 4 speed automatic that I was looking at, but the cost difference was not significant and I needed as many miles as the car would give me. (the 4 speed option was dropped for the '98 model year, although I can't imagine why!)

Having now put better than 55 thousand on the car, I can happily tell you that it is still a pleasure to drive. The car is nimble for an economy model, with excellent gas mileage ( ~ 30mpg at 60mph) and enough pep for passing on tight New England highways. I am usually the only passenger in the car, and have developed a taste for the agressive handling that my wife doesn't appreciate. ;) It's heavier than the Neon, and with its relatively wide track, it does very well in the snow. My model has traction control, and I recommend you get it.

For those of you that appreciate becoming &quot;one&quot; with the vehicle, you'll love the snug cockpit, where controls are all within easy reach. The steering wheel has soft ergonomic lumps you can squeeze at the idiot in front of you too... 

At 6', I have the seat about as far back as it can go, so beware tall people. The cup holder is not in the best location, but if you've got the arms, there's a better one behind the center console for &quot;the kids&quot; that you can share.

Trunk space is roomy, and the fold-down seats give you lots of room for hauling long objects, although you'll have trouble with anything taller than 18&quot;, as the trunk mouth is rather narrow. (This car needs a hatchback!)

Problems: I've had the radio replaced twice due to electrical malfunctions in the display. There are two recalls that affect this model year. Both involve winterizing electrical components, so if you live in the desert, you can ignore this paragraph.

Commuters: here's a fun, cheap little car that should get you that 30,000 a year you need.

Tall guys &amp; people with lots of friends: Beware, the back seat space is small if the driver is tall. Also, engine performance fades rapidly if you're carrying the additional 600 pounds of passengers and their gear.<br><br>
