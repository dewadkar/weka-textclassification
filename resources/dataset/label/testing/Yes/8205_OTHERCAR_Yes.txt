            When you think of Luxury cars you usually go to either a Lexus or a BMW. Well hey that goes true for the common person. But if you really want to show the world that you are your own person go and buy an A8.

Introduction:

The A8, introduced to the masses in 97 as a 98 model, has not changed since. This is one of the most technologically advanced vehicles on the road, especially when it comes to the use of the lightweight space age materials. The A8's body is made out of pure aluminum or how Audi likes to call &quot;Audi Space Frame&quot; or asf. The A8's power plant is a 40-Valve V8, 310 horsepower engine. 

Exterior:

The exterior, well.. to be truthful is nothing to be hollering about. It looks like a Nissan maxima at best. This car won't really turn any heads. 

Interior:

Once you step into the A8 you immediately realize that your not in a BMW anymore Dorothy. Instead of the usual luxury look, you get a nice mixture of the sporty luxury look, which is quite refreshing. The interior is covered with real wood and Valcona leather.
The Trunk Space is humongous, so all you people in the mafia this car is for you. I think you could at least fit around 3-4 people inside it. 

The seating is all leather of course; the front cabin is very very roomy even for a kid like me, which is around 6 foot. The back however got a little bit cramped, so anyone that's over 5 10 I would really recommend having them not take the back seat. 

The Telephone and Tiptronic controls are now standard on the A8's which do make driving a lot easier, no more searching the dash for these controls.

Safety 
	Dual front airbags are supplemented by side airbags tucked into the front seats. Rear passengers also get side airbags, mounted to the seat rather than the door panel. Audi's Sideguard head airbag system consists of inflatable curtain airbags installed in the headliner along each side of the car, which cover the windows in the event of an accident and remain inflated for five seconds to protect the head in case the vehicle rolls over. 

Engine and transmission:

The engine is all that you could possibly ask for. With the v-8 goes a wonderful 310 hp. That's right you heard me 310 ponies dragging your lightweight car across for your next business meeting. Kind of like Apollo in his chariot. 

The transmission has the clutch less manual. You can either choose to be total automatic or have it be a manual without the clutch, choosing the gears, which you want to go in. The shifting is absolute non-noticeable, which it should be when it comes to luxury cars. 

The overall Ride: 

	When you remove the key from the ignition the steering wheel moves out of the way.  Which made getting out of the car and getting back in a lot easier then the cars that I was used to.
	The GPS system that's included in the base model was very accurate, I really can't belive how far things have advanced ever since the introduction of this wonderful device.  
	
        One of the things that I did find wrong about this car was that the suspension was too soft.  It felt like I was driving... yes kids either a dodge dynasty or even a... gasp buick! 
	
        Alas I did not loose hope, maybe it would come up on top and make up for the suspension.  Too bad it didn't, letting in a little too much cabin noise for a  luxury car.  However Audi does come up with one great point, which is the quattro all-wheel-drive  system.  I drove this car when a tornado hit my town, no fear though, I ran into absoulty no skids or fishtails.  

Closing:

	Everything would've been absoulty great about this car if the suspension problem was fixed and made a little bit more stiffer.  However the all-wheel-drive does make up for the suspension's sins.  If you don't want to be like all the rest of your co-workers buying their BMW's and Lexus you can be your own person and buy an A8.
