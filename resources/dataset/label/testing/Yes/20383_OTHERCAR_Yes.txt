            My wife spotted this car a few years ago (shortly before getting married) when it was at 89,000 miles and for sale by neighbors.  We drove it and enjoyed the ride immediately and bought it.

Since then (1997, I think), I have put at least another 80,000 miles on it.  I use the car at work to travel back and forth to remote school sites across the county in very hilly territory.  We also usually take two trips to Florida each year in it (we live close to southeast Tennessee), one or two trips to Savannah, Georgia, and many, many trips to both Atlanta, Georgia and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  The car is exceptionally comfortable for these trips and if it were not for needing to eat and other bodily functions, we wouldn't get out of the car until reaching our destination.

With over 170,000 miles on it, I sometimes still can't tell if it is running when it idles because it is extremely quiet and smooth.  That is not to say we haven't had our share of problems.

First, let me say that I am a fairly conservative driver with an aggressive attitude (I don't overtax my engine, but I do hold my own in traffic).

About two or three years after getting the car, the temperature sensor/send unit went bad, causing the car to overheat due to improper fuel mixture calculations.  This problem persisted for several months before I took my father-in-law's advice and tried the sensor, because I thought it was anything but a sensor causing such a problem.  Stupid me, I guess.

Every year, I replace the alternator at least once, usually twice.  If you get this car and replace the alternator, go ahead and get the Lifetime Replacement Warranty alternator available from Advance Auto Parts.  You'll thank me.  Even the mechanics at several Chevy dealerships have told me that this is a very common problem with this model.  Oh well.

I've replaced the water pump twice.  Usually, the only time you replace a water pump on a car is when its bearings give out, which says nothing negative about a car as a whole.

One day, when backing out of the driveway, the car shuddered and growled the whole way out.  I was afraid it was the transmission.  Turned out, the upper motor mount was worn out.  That was very easy to replace, to my surprise.

For about 40,000 of the miles, the car had a chirping sound coming from the belt.  New belts would solve the issue for a few days.  Finally, one day the belt crawled off the tensioner, as the tensioner's bearings had given out.  I replaced the tensioner and the noise problem solved itself for a couple of weeks.  Look below for the final solution in the noisy chirp problem.

I've replaced one of the rear hub/bearing assemblies, although I can't remember how long ago.  The same goes for shocks and struts.  Tires wear about average on this car, as do brakes (always remember that, often, the cheaper the brake pad/shoe replacement, the longer the shoe/pad will last, but also the shorter time your rotors will last).

At about 165,000 miles, we replaced the head gasket because of a small cold water leak that concerned me, but didn't seem to affect the car, especially since it stopped when the engine reached norm op temp.

While we were at it, we replaced the power steering pump to try to solve the noisy chirp in the belt area.  Turned out the guess was right.  (I call it a guess, although after using an automotive stethoscope, we were pretty sure it would fix it).

Now I know that seems like a lot of repair, but it really isn't (other than the alternators).  Especially considering that I STILL GET 33 MPG Highway and 26 MPG City!!!  And remember, the engine still runs like it is only 2 years old at worst and the transmission works smoothly and never has abnormal metal in the pan when I change the filter.

If you take care of a car like this (regular fluid and filter changes, etc), it will reward you with quality performance for years to come.

With that said, let's look at performance.  I haven't timed any accelerations or anything, but I'd say this 2.2 L engine with the 3 speed transmission provides as much power and acceleration as a small economy 6 cylinder.

The ABS Brakes are wonderful.  I don't know how I ever did without them!  It makes me so much more comfortable in dangerous weather and has proven itself many times.

The cassette/AM/FM radio burned its belt up and I replaced it with a Jensen tape deck, then a Pioneer DEH-2100 CD unit.  Easy enough to do.

I hope that you understand why I recommend this car, even given the service record above.  If you have any questions, please write a comment and I'll try to get back to you.
