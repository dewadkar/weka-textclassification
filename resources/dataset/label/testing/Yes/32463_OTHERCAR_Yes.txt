            Why Buy ? Recently sold one, an '88 LS with 108,000 miles, best car I've 
ever owned, I'm 72 and have owned quite a few cars. Rear wheel drive is the basic reason. My '99 is equipped with anti-loc brakes and traction control.

I like every thing about the car itself. If you really want to move it moves. This model, at least, is made in Canada. I think they build them better up there.

Only dislike.  I had a terrible time getting the front end adjusted. When new, car drifted or pulled to the left. Several dealerships said it's fine, it was not fine. Finally found a GOOD front end man ( they are hard to find) who solved my problem. FORD'S general office stinks when it comes to customer relations. At least in my case.

Who should buy. Anyone who wants a nice big comfortable car. If you want to &quot;push&quot; the car add the handling package. It's heavy, safer and comfortable.

If you want to bounce along, don't buy it
