            This car is amazing for a first time buyer! I got into an accident in my old car and needed to buy a new one. I had a list of about 6 or 7 cars but the Sonata kept the top spot each time I re-did my list. It has all the features I was looking for as STANDARDS... no extra money for what I actually wanted. I was in love with this car long before I test drove it. The day I finally did test drive it is the day I drove it off the lot permanently.

The Sonata is the perfect size for a family of 4 or a single person (I am the latter). There is tons of leg room in the front AND back! The trunk is huge, plenty of space for lots of luggage, shopping bags or a trunk full of dirty clothes to take to mom and dad's! 

My parents, sight unseen, loved this car for the warranty. Let's face it, repairs of any kind can be extremely costly. The Sonata (and all Hyundai vehicles) come with THE best warranty coverage in the industry. That was a big selling point for them especially since my old mechanic (my dad) lives 4 hours away. Everyone who sits or drives in my car loves it. General consensus: this car is adorable, drives smoothly, rides very well, is comfortable and just plain wonderful.

I recently took a 4-hour trip in it... the Ultimate test of driving performance. It was comfortable, smooth and perfect. The cruise control is super easy to use with the control buttons on the steering wheel. The CD player is within arm's reach so you don't have to stretch and fumble with it. The moon roof either opens all the way by sliding into the roof or vents. When it is vented, the only noise you hear is the sound of the wind. Everything is very smooth and quiet in this car. The gas tank and trunk opening controls are next to the drivers seat. All windows can be locked for rowdy children *or* college students!

The only thing I don't like about it is that there are no overhead lights in the back due to the moon roof. The lights are up front over the rearview mirror and next to the moon roof controls. But to solve this &quot;problem&quot; I went out and bought those tap light things and velcro'd them to the ceiling.

This car, to me, is perfect and I VERY HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a well-built, totally bumper-to-bumper covered car.<br><br>
