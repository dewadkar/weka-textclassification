              I was shopping to replace my '92 Explorer.  This model was one of the first years for Explorer and the "SUV mania".  While I was looking for a large family vehicle, suitable for vacation trips, I also bought the Explorer for the possibilites it allowed for off-road adventures.  I did end up taking the Explorer on some serious no roads trips, especially in Death Valley.  I'm not talking about "dirt roads", I'm talking river beds where you're in 4x4 low going 2 mph....

  I learned that I, in fact, had no interest in spending my  vacation time bouncing my brains out.  My kids enjoyed these adventures even less than I did.  They swore "never again".  

  Keeping this in mind I was drawn to the Honda Pilot as a replacement for the Explorer.  It had similar size but was reviewed as much more reliable than my "Exploader"  (I went thru 2 transmissions; the first was replaced when the Ford had only 55,000 miles!).  It was not a "serious off-roader" but I didn't view that as a loss.

  At this point I read that the Subaru Outback had ~7" ground clearance, something which I found surprising, as I had thought of it as basically a station wagon....  I decided I should try one!  I was VERY surprised at how much I liked it.  I was mostly impressed by how much better it handled than the Explorer/Pilot.  

   When I returned the Outback from my test drive I was told to try the Forester XT.  Looking at it my reaction was "so what?". It looked like the Outback to me.  I was given a reprint of the Car & Driver review of XT.  Hmmm. THIS looks interest....

   Well, my test drive (Automatic Transmission (AT) in XT  just blew me away!  I wanted this.  I'm sold!  I really can't describe the rush this car gave me.  You've got to feel it yourself to believe it!

   Now for some nitty gritty:

   I got the Premium Package XT with an AT.  The moonroof on this model is amazing.  It is so big it is almost like driving a convertible!  There is no MT/AT mpg penalty with the AT.  While I drive a MT Miata I found the AT on the XT was more than enough for me.  The zoom on XT, even with an AT is  simply astounding!  The 5.3 second  Zero to 60 that was recorded with the MT simply blows away most SPORTS CARS.  The 1/2 second  loss with the AT wasn't noticed at all by me.  This is a real "wolf in sheeps clothing".  It looks like a tall station wagon, but is loaded with PERFORMANCE.  

   While you get to drive a "rocket" you don't have to pay for rocket insurance.  The insurance rates for XT are very reasonable.   

   Negatives: 

    Yes, the Forester has less room for "stuff" when we take a trip.  The solution is simple:  I put a Yakima basket on the roof and we put the excess baggage up there.  The logic was simple too.  Why drive an Explorer/Pilot sized SUV for the baggage space that is only really needed a very few times a year.  For 95% of my vehicle miles I would NOT  be in the vehicle with all the kids and baggage.  So why drive around a hulking beast for my 95% use of the vehicle???  I don't have 5 kids so a 3rd row of seats wasn't a feature for me.  I certainly wasn't going to buy my car for the time I got to ferry a bunch of folks to the airport.  In sum, the roof rack (I've got bicycle mounts up there too) makes up for any size problems with a smaller vehicle than the full sized SUV's.

    While compared with my Explorer the mpg I get from XT is reasonable, one can certainly get better mpg is most similar sized vehicles to XT.  The story here is simple.  If this is a big issue for you then get an XS or X Forester.  You've got to "pay to play".  The real cost of XT in lower mpg and the cost of premium gas is probably a few hundred dollars a year extra (and, of course, NOTHING extra comparing with most "SUV's") for the XT model, a few thousand dollars during the life of the car.  The amazing performance of XT is well worth that price for me.  It's certainly a BARGAIN compared to most vehicles with XT's performance.

   The Forester is officially a "Passenger" Vehicle, NOT a truck.  It is called an SUV but it really isn't.  It has NO rollover warning sticker.  The US Gov't/Insurance Institute crash tests for Forester beat everything else in this class.  You've simply got to see the reports and videos of the crash tests!  XT has a dynamic head rest, motorized seat belt tensioner, and side air-bags standard.  It is much much safer than the Full Size SUV simply because you can maneuver out of most situations and don't need to be concerned about SUV rollover.  Nevertheless, Subaru presents XT as an "SUV" for marketing purposes.  The tires that are OEM don't match the performance of the XT.  When they are replaced by tires that are better and less "off road" oriented the XT gains its true potential in handling.  It really feels a LOT more like my Miata and NOTHING like my Explorer did.  

	In sum, XT rocks!  Try it and see if you get blown away too!  Join us XT owners at

MORE::

Again, I've collected lots more information which you can puruse (Reviews, data, files, pictures, etc.) and put it all in one place:

The XT is the Turbo version of the 2004 Forester, with a 2.5l engine. This is the only Forester that has the "zoom zoom" I described. There is NO turbo lag with this car. You car thrown back into the seat right off the line (the Impreza WRX has a turbo that has "lag" and only kicks in after the first few seconds of acceleration). [The $100,000 Porche Cayenne TURBO is only 0.2 seconds faster than XT).

The less than stellar gas mileage that may turn some buyers to the X or XS Forester, rather than the XT turbo, is officially 19/23 for the AT.  Most owners are getting 20/21 in everyday use.  Some have gotten 25mpg in steady highway driving.  Your results will vary  (it is HARD to keep off the turbo.  It's too much fun!). 

I find the brakes very good, although I'd prefer a firmer feel. XT with leather seats is very comfortable -- there is a lumbar adjustment [but, curiously no power seats]. I got the XT in November. My longest drives have been ~200 miles. It was so much fun driving that I didn't notice much else ;) But I would say it was comfortable. I adjusted the front seats for where they'd be and then got into the back myself to feel how much room there'd be back there for the kids. More than adequate but not cavernous. 

I've driven up to Yosemite to ski twice and the full time AWD was a real pleasure. Totally solid on the road. I had to TRY to skid (just doing some experimenting). I'd never need chains with this car. 

Visibility is excellent. There's lots of glass and no obstructions. I've put on Plus Sized 17 inch tires [Falcon Ziex 512: 225/50R17]. XT now handles like my Miata! Simply Amazing!!!!
