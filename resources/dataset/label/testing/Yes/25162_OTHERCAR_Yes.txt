            I don't personally own this car, but I did own an older Protege' and have driven the 2000 model several times, it reminds me much of the Toyota Corolla.

The car is well built, as you can tell by simply slamming the doors, it sounds solid because the doors close with a reassuring 'thunk' instead of a *bang*

The Protege can be fairly well equipped too!  Alloy wheels, CD, moonroof and more, everything except leather, and I can just see Mazda coming up with something here that would rival the $26,000 Infinity G20, and pricing it around 17,000, which, well equipped is the price of the Protege', it comes in an LX and an ES version, and I would recommend getting the 1.8 litre in line 4 cylinder in this one, the lower end 4-cylinder that comes standard with the LX just doesn't have enough umph!.... and getting 30 miles or better highway, you can easily up the anty on the engine without costing too much more.

Maintinance on this car is fairly simple, regular oil changes, tune up at 100,000.... air filters and PCV valves occasionally and you'll be running fine up to better than 250,000 miles!  These Mazdas, (even though now build by Ford) tend to run forever if you change the oil regularly, which reminds me, my 626 needs an oil change soon!

The Protege' is a smooth shifting, quiet, somewhat smooth riding car, the seats could be a 'little' bit softer, but with a little wear they'd be fine.

I give this one a 7.8 out of 10 for the compacts!<br><br>
