            <b>A few days back, I received a call from my father.

&quot;Your aunt is looking for a new SUV,&quot; he said, &quot;Something mid-size or larger. You think you can help?&quot;
&quot;But what about her minivan?&quot; I asked him.
&quot;It's in the shop more than her garage. She's sick of vans anyway.&quot;

I stretched my suspenders and told him I was the man for the job.</b>

We looked at the Isuzu Trooper, the Chevy Tahoe, the Nissan Pathfinder, and the Toyota 4Runner as suitable options. In this review, I will try to incorporate the other cars so you can learn a bit about them as well.

Let me start off by saying that you would do well to choose any of these vehicles if you need something with more space than a car or smaller SUV. For us however, the Isuzu Trooper won the race, and here are the reasons why:

<b>LOOKS: 7</b>
Okay, okay. The Trooper didn't exactly win the beauty contest here. But although it's boxy (it is now affectionately called &quot;The Box&quot;), the Trooper does have a very appealing <b>conservative and refined demeanor</b>- more than can be said for the equally boxy Tahoe. The Pathfinder and 4Runner both are very attractive. But looks are only skin deep... what mattered here was the size. The Trooper is neither mid-sized nor full-sized. It's a nice &quot;in between.&quot;

<b>CARGO SPACE: 9</b>
The Isuzu Trooper more than held its own with &lt;90.s cu. ft. of cargo space. I also liked its 70/30 rear door that opens like a refrigerator/freezer. The Tahoe could swallow a ton of stuff. The Pathfinder had up to 85 cubic feet of space. The 4Runner had an impressive amount of room with the seats folded up.

<b>INTERIOR: 8</b>
The Trooper's interior was worthy of praise. It has <b>excellent visibility</b>, well-placed controls, and tons of head, hip, shoulder, and legroom. The rear passengers get a footrest (standard on the Luxury or Performance packages), a neat feature. The Trooper has a *colossal* sunroof, spanning 5 square feet. Overall, the Trooper's <b>materials are very good quality</b>, and are right up there with the 4Runner's. The Tahoe's plasticky interior did not seem like it could withstand the test of time. The Trooper seats are very supportive. My aunt has a bad back, so she loved that. As an added plus, the back seats recline for added comfort to rear passengers.
The Pathfinder's stereo emerged the winner with its crisp, clear Bose system. The Trooper was about mid-pack, I would say. The air conditioner worked pretty well on the Trooper, although the 4Runner seemed to have the most powerful system.

<b>ENGINE: 8</b>
The Trooper's engine was recently upgraded along with a host of other changes in 1998. The 3.5L V6 engine gives you 215hp and 230lb-ft torque. That is <b>plenty of muscle</b> even considering the truck's curb weight. Off-the-line acceleration of this vehicle may surprise you. And highway passing is better than you would expect for such a tall vehicle, though it could be better. The Tahoe's V8 engine was the brawniest of the pack and provided relatively smooth shifts, but had the worst gas mileage by far. The 4Runner's shifting was silky and seamless, although it did not out-muscle the Trooper. The Pathfinder's 170hp engine really showed signs of weakness in this category.

<b>RIDE:  8</b>
The Trooper's <b>suspension received high marks</b> from us. It soaks up bumps without the floating sensation that the Tahoe had. There are absolutely no rattles or squeaks even on the bigger bumps. We actually heard a few rattles in the Tahoe, which is inexcusable for a brand-new car. The 4Runner and Pathfinder were absolutely solid.
The Trooper was the second quietest of the bunch, second only to the 4Runner. A bit of wind noise could be heard, although improvements with the hood and general aerodynamics diminished this.

<b>HANDLING:  7</b>
The steering of the Trooper is responsive, but it feels disconnected at higher speeds. You have to correct the darn wheel many times to avoid wandering off the road.
Now comes the big question: <b>was the Trooper &quot;tippy?&quot;</b> Consumer Reports made the headlines when they rated the Trooper &quot;UNSAFE&quot; (gasp!) because it was prone to roll over during emergency turns. This is total hogwash. The government tested the Trooper and said CR's claim was unfounded. (Isuzu is now suing Consumer Reports for lost sales.) After driving the Trooper, <b>I found it no more tippy than any of the other SUV's we test-drove</b>. Yes, the Trooper did lean during turns. But it was nothing to worry about and I feel that the Trooper is a <b>very safe truck to drive</b>.

<b>RELIABILITY: 8</b>
Here, the 4Runner wins first place, the Trooper and Pathfinder tie for second (still very good), and the Tahoe is dead last, according to Consumer Reports. The Trooper satisfaction rate is very high, and resale value is quite good. We <b>expect very few problems</b> from this vehicle. Of course I will keep you posted with mini-updates so you can see for yourself...
On the other hand, you must take into account the cost of maintenance. Should something happen to your Trooper, it may cost you a pretty penny to replace a part, for instance. Remember that the Trooper is assembled in <i>Japan</i>, and subsequently parts will be less abundant and more costly for shipping. I have an uncle in Puerto Rico who has owned three Troopers but now actually recommends <i>against</i> them for this cost of maintenance. I may sound a little naive, but I see it this way: better to have fewer (yet more expensive) repairs than many (yet cheaper) repairs... and that's assuming those repairs are even necessary. 


<b>WARRANTY: 9</b>
While we're on the subject, let's talk warranties. The Trooper has the <b>best warranty</b> out of the competition. All Isuzu vehicles offer full bumper-to-bumper coverage for 3 years or 50,000 miles (instead of the standard 36,000). The warranty includes free emergency roadside assistance (for flat tires, no gas, towing, locked keys, etc.) for 5 years or 60,000 miles. Neither Toyota nor Nissan even offer standard roadside assistance. Chevrolet offers it, but only for 3 years/36,000 miles. 
<i><b>UPDATE:</b> 2000 Isuzu Troopers now have a 10 year/120,000 mile powertrain warranty- one of the best in the country, and best in this class.</i> 

<b>VALUE AND BOTTOM LINE: 9</b>
And now, the numbers that REALLY count... The <b>Trooper scored the highest</b> out of the group in value. We bought the Trooper with the Luxury Package (leather, Torque-On-Demand 4WD, HUGE sunroof, heated seats, wood trim, power seats, two-tone paint, alloy wheels, etc) for an out-the-door price of just $29,599. The 4Runner is the priciest, and the dealers won't budge much on the price, either. As for the Tahoe, I think dealers charge too much for a vehicle of sub-par finish. The Pathfinder came in second, mainly because the 1999.5 models are being moved out for the upcoming redesigned Pathfinder in 2000. I would suggest checking out the Pathfinder as well, for it was second on our shopping list. But if you are looking for an SUV now, I recommend the Trooper very strongly. Considering its over-priced competition and its own merits, I give the Trooper an 8 out of 10. It is a <b>solid SUV and a solid bargain</b>.

<b>AVERAGE SCORE: 8.11 out of 10
VARA'S PERSONAL RATING: 8 out of 10</b>
