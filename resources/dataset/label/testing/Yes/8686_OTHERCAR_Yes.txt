            I was looking around for a car around $22,000 that had a powerful V6, leather and was a good candidate for my 20 minute commute, and yet be ideal for those sporty road trips on the Interstate. I first considered the Maxima SE, but I realized that w/ leather, and a few of the other bells, the Maxima quickly becomes very expensive and much less impressive w/ that type of sticker price attached to the upgraded packages on top of the $22,000 base SE price. I highly suggest test driving the V6 EX VL before buying anything else in this price range. 

The Good:
* The V6 VTEC engine is worth its weight in gold. I can't say enough good things about the V6 engine. Forget the V4 model, it will leave you needing much more, especially when considered in the long run of buying and owning a new car. I will mention that the V6 is NOT available in a manual transmission.
* The car handles like a hybrid between a sports car and luxury sedan. You feel like you own the road with this car on the interstate; you really have to keep an eye on that speedometer. Without a single doubt this car is fun to drive, and yet allows the driver to maintain the required comfort on the longer interstate trips. 
* The automatic climate control is really nice touch of luxury and this system seems to do a really good job at maintaining temperature controls as expected. I enjoy the ergonomics of the analog dial controls coupled together w/ the automatic climate control system. I found the system to be a little confusing and distracting when operated in the manual configuration, but not really a concern for me.
*  The basic audio control mounted on the steering wheel is a great idea and make the basic operation of the audio systems much less distracting while driving. I also liked that the antenna is embedded on the rear window (resembling rear window defroster wires). My only concern is that these controls would surly become useless buttons if I decided to upgrade the audio system with any aftermarket product. The stock stereo sounds fine, but not anything overly impressive.
* The price on this car when considering that you get a V6, leather, sunroof, alloy wheels, cd player along with other standard equipment that comes together nicely for around $22,700. I had hard time coming even close to this value when researching a Volvo S40, Nissan Maxima, or Audi.

The Bad:
* All of the detectable road noise is introduced through the rear of the car. The engine is barely detectable, but the noise from the rear tires is quite detectable especially when the road is wet.
* The $119 Honda Accord car mats are cheap, very cheap. I really expected better quality when spending $119 on car mats from the dealership.
* The turn blinker and windshield wiper controls feel and look really cheap. The EX VL really does deserve better quality than something that looks right out of a much cheaper Civic model.
* Adults will complain sitting in the back seat; it's cramped and road noise from rear tires could become tiresome very quickly. I found that it's even quite a feat for a adult to climb into the backseat.
* The lighter interior seems like it will be a chore to keep clean, when on the other hand the dark interior looked cheap and plastic. This would be a good time to mention that the color choices/combinations in the EX VL model are somewhat limited.

The Really Bad:
* The &quot;Tampa Honda Land&quot; in Tampa, Florida tried to pull one over me in the financing department. I was a first time buyer, and they tried to finance the loan at 14%. I discovered, when I did the math, that Jeff Leff, in the financing department, meant to say ~14.85% financing when actually telling me 14%. Jeff practically refused to commit to anything in writing, other than my payments, until I was ready to sign. This especially angered me when I walked out of the dealership and secured a loan at 7.85% from the USF Credit Union the same day. I also caught him inflating the local tax rate, in order to raise the price even further. Jeff explained this discrepancy as being the system not automatically putting in the correct tax rate for Tampa.  I had a hard time buying that, assuming be probably does this 10 times day, and the tax rate has been the same for some time now in Tampa. Needless to say, I highly suggest you check all the numbers, and think really long and hard before signing anything. I also suggest checking out http://www.carbuyingtips.com for some helpful tips when doing your best not to get ripped off. I personally think that the Federal Government should have more checks in place for these types of dishonest practices that take advantage of unsuspecting consumers everyday.  The way Jeff Leff does business at Tampa Hondaland left a bad taste in my mouth.

NOTES:
I also suggest www.ahmotor.com for any Honda owner needing any parts or accessories.

ADDITIONAL REVIEW INFO AFTER DRIVING THE CAR FOR 3mo+:

- loud at 60mph+ from tire and wind noise. My understanding is that Honda addressed this issue in the 2001 models. It's REALLY the most disapointing thing about the car, and not what I expected to get from a top of line Honda. I guess that's why they have Acuras. I have also noticed and occassional slight rattle from the inside rear of the vehicle.

- The vehicle handles like a potato. It's *NOT* a sports car! It's a very heavy car and it feels like a pile of bricks around turns. This might have alot to do w/ the REALLY crappy stock tires. The tires don't perform well on wet roads and are VERY noisy at speeds 60mph+.

- NO TRACTION CONTROL! Slip and slide on wet roads. This feature is available on the 2001 models.

+ I love the car, it's NOT a Mercedes or a BMW but for $22-25k you get a really nice sporty-luxo crusiser that is hard to match in this price range.
