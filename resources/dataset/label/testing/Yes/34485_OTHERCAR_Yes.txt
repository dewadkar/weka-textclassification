            When I first saw the advertisements for the new Daewoo Leganza, I thought that it was a beautiful car.  The lines of it just echoed down the car and caught my eye.  I knew I had to have one, and what could be better that the low, LOW price of one.  I was one of the first to get mine and so far I am very satisfied with the car.  I've had very few problems with the car, and a few can be expected from a new company entering the American market.  I love the way it drives, rides, and looks, although I wish it had more power.  It looks bad to get passed at a red-light by a econo car, but I LOVE IT besides that it is a great little car.<br><br>
