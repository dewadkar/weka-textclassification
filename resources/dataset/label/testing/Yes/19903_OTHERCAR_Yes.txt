            I've leased my Montero for about 3 years now, and I can't say I'm displeased with its performance.  It's always been fairly reliable and I've never had any big complaints.

However, there are several little things that get to you.  The Montero drives like a truck, no questions about it.  Now, I'm not saying that's bad necessarily, you just are going to feel every bump in the road.

It also doesn't turn extremely sharply.  This can be a problem at times, but nothing major.  It's acceleration is also not fantastic, which is one of the reasons I got rid of mine.

The cabin also gets pretty loud.  Especially while moving quickly, the noise from the motor filters straight into the passenger area.

It's a pretty reliable car.  I've never had to take it in for anything big.  Just the usual visits to the shop.

It's a good car, nothing fantastic.   I think the price was pretty good too.  The mileage also isn't bad for an SUV.<br><br>
