            The Chevrolet Camaro has been at the top of the American musclecar scene since its introduction in 1966 as a 1967 model year.  From an era when there were dozens of cars in this class, we have moved through gas shortages and emissions regulations to today when there is a revival in the musclecar, with only three alive today--the Camaro, its stablemate the Firebird/Trans-Am, and the Mustang.  Soon the Mustang will be alone with no plans for the Camaro and Firebird after the 2002 model year.  Until then, these cars are the premier stallions in the ponycar corral.  The Camaro is an all-around stronger car than the Mustang.  It has more power, 200hp in the 3.8V6, 305hp in the 5.7 liter Z28, and an amazing 320hp in the SS version of that same engine.  0 to 60 times hover around the 5.1-5.3 second range, making it easy to skin any Cobras that dare to tangle.  Transmission options are a four-speed auto and a six-speed manual, and for even greater control of that six-speed, a new Hurst shifter is optional.  Opt for the 1LE performance handling package and you have a street legal road racer that rivals any car in handling.  Although the muscle is reminiscent of the 60s, the comfort level is an entirely different ballgame.  From leather seats, climate control, and premium stereo this modern musclecar is able to combine comfort with all out performance.  Although a ride in the Camaro won't be mistake for the comfort of an Eldorado, it is still generations ahead of the Camaros from just ten short years ago.  If you have the desire to own the fastest thing under $35000, you will need this car.  And with power numbers for 2001 expected to escalate, this Camaro is ready to go out with a bang.<br><br>
