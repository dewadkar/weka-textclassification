            I live in Southern California which has the ideal climate for a car like the Miata. In the summer the roof is never on my car - unless it's too hot in which case it's roof on and a/c full blast. I have a bike rack which I attach to the trunk and that works just great. The rack fits inside the trunk too, even with the spare in back.

My Miata is a bright yellow and I absolutely adore it. It's a very cute little car but it could be the cutest thing in the world and still be absolutely useless. However, that's not the case. 

The power to weight ratio, whilst not being fantastic, is good enough. Handling is pretty good, with a tight sportscar feel. Power steering makes it easy to park and fuel consumption averages around 26mpg. The Japanese engineering means that it's very reliable, needs very little attention and makes do with one service a year plus regular oil changes.

Sure, there's not a whole lot of room but for most of my everyday needs I have absolutely no difficulties. The trunk is big enough to get a week's supermarket shop in there; it even fits a set of golf clubs so if that's your scene you'll be all set. The most inconvenient lack of storage is actually in the interior as there are no door pockets and the glove box is barely big enough to fit your insurance documents and a small map!

I would absolutely definitely NOT own this car in anything other than a dry climate. It does leak around the windows, quite badly in heavy rain and I can imagine that it's a real pain in very icy weather. If you are in any way intimidated by all the large SUVs and 4x4s on the roads, you probably won't enjoy driving this little car. <br><br>
