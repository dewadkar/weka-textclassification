            I purchased a 1996 Nissan Altima GXE and it was the best investment I could have made in a new car.  It has turned out to be one of the most reliable cars I have ever driven.  It is a four-door sedan with air bags for both driver and passenger.  I purchased my car with extras such as air conditioning, automatic transmission, and anti-lock brakes.  An extra surprise I found after purchase was that my car insurance was lower than anticipated because the Altima is considered to be a &quot;family sedan.&quot;  It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it is a workhorse of a car for every day commuting and also for fun time in the mountains.

The only unpleasant surprises that I have found is that it has an incredibly large turning radius.  Don't know if it is the front-wheel drive or perhaps how the chassis was designed, but if I need to make a U-turn, I have to make sure I have at least 3 lanes to turn into.  This becomes an issue when trying to navigate in downtown streets.  My answer so far has simply been to avoid parallel parking.

Also, I religiously keep up the suggested maintenance on my car.  I never run over my due date for oil changes and always make sure that any &quot;big&quot; overhauls are completed timely.  Throughout all of these maintenance trips, the mechanics have yet to find anything major go wrong with the car.

I would recommend a Nissan vehicle to anybody looking for a &quot;family sedan&quot; type car.  I also had test driven a Toyota Camry and a Subaru Legacy.  The Altima had more horsepower than the Toyota and the Subaru Legacy's car insurance was through the roof!
