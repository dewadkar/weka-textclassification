            After hearing from my wife that she wanted a Lexus for the past year, I decided to look into the used Lexus market.  Like most other high end cars, the used Lexus is no cheaper than other new cars.  With this in mind I knew the Avalon was a Lexus SC300 without the name(or V-8.)

Toyota has a pre-driven, executive program in which we found quite a few untitled used cars with around 4k-6k miles.  Some of the cars were really beat up, almost worst than rentals.  But a few of them were very well cared for and we eventually found one with all the options we wanted for a great price.  We looked at the Honda Accord, Toyota Camery, Mitsubishi's sedans and even BMW but for the money, you cant beat the room, ride and feel.

I love the leather on the interior as it is very soft, softer than most others we test drove.  The sight lines are also very good which was important as I'm tall but my wife is short and often has a tough time seeing out of cars.  In the winter the heated seats come in very handy but I wish there was zoned temp. control(now in 2000 Avalons).  The anti lock brakes and traction control is not very good though as I've driven others that were much better.

The only thing I've had to do over the past year has been changing the oil, which is very messy since the oil filter points downward.  When you take the filter off, any oil in it drips all over the floor.  I'm sure this is so the oil doesn't sit in the filter but still very messy. Otherwise all one has to do is rotate tires and fill washer fluid.  By the way, the washer fluid container must be bottomless because I can never seem to top it off which is nice because you never have to keep the extra half quart.

The only gripes I have is an air leak in the drivers' side window that can't seem to get fixed, the front brakes make a clunking noise when you go from reverse to forward(checks out fine), and the fact that a can of pop rattles in the holders between the front seats as you are driving.  A felt liner on the bottom could eliminate this.

Driving the car is great.  I plan to keep it for a long time as long as nothing major happens.  Anyone looking to get into the luxury car market but gets sticker shock should look into test driving this car.
