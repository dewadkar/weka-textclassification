                 I have always admired from afar the Mitsubishi 3000GT, but not until recently did I get do discover there there was much more to this car than its beautiful looks.  It just so happens that my best friend owns a 1995 Mitsubishi 3000GT SL.  I was very impressed by what all that this car had to offer in the way of features.  In fact, it has some of the same features that todays high end luxury cars have.  One of the nicest features is the ECS (electronically controlled suspension) which can be switched from touring to sport mode.  The driver seat is by far the nicest of any sports car, even today, with 4 way lumbar support and 6 power functions.  Couple with this the black perferated leather, and you have a winning combination.  It also comes with two power outlets, one for your cell phone, and the other for a radar detector (which for this car I highly reccomend). The stereo in this car is also top notch - a 6 speaker Infinity system.  The whole feel of interior of this car is extremely sporty, with just a touch of luxury.

     The apperance of this car is nothing short of extremely striking.  Astheticaly speaking, this car has a great advantage of other sports cars in its price range such as the Camaro, Mustang, Firebird, Mazda MX6, or Toyata MR2.  The side scoops and sexy curves of this car do wonders for its fantastic appearance, as well as its aerodynamic quailities.  Now on to handling and performance...

     There are three versions of this car, the base model (and underpowered 5 cylinder), the SL with a 225hp 3.0L V6 and the twin turbo all wheel drive 3.0L 320 HP VR4.  My experience is with the SL.  I must say that I am very impressed with all aspects of handling and performance of this car.  Because this car is front wheel drive, the handling is exceptional.  It can corner far better than any rear wheel drive, and better than most front wheel drive vehicles.  It has plenty of power, especially high end, and will comfortably cruise at speeds well over 100 mph.  Off the line, you will have no problem beating most NA 6 cylinder cars, and will even be able to have fun with some of the V8's.  The SL has a very nice engine sound, and the functional dual exhuast helps to generate more power.  Its 7000 rpm redline allows the car generate high end speed, and shift more aggressively.  This car really has everything that you want, and some things that you would never think to ask for.
