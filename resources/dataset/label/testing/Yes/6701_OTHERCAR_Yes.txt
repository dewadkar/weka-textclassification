            First, I want to say I am not a typical &quot;car&quot; guy.  I would love to be able to say that I know everything there is to know from a mechanical standpoint, but I have two left thumbs (figuratively speaking) and would be more likely to break things like Tim Allen on Home Improvement.  However, I do know what I like, and my 1997 Chevrolet Lumina has been a good workhorse for the past year.

I traded in my 1993 Ford Explorer, which gave me nothing but headaches for my Lumina.  The dealership I went to was willing to pay off my Explorer in full, even though I only had owned the car for six months.  I had never driven a Chevy before, but was impressed by the smooth features of the car.

First, I like the shape.  It is pleasing to the eye, and streamlined.  Of course, that doesn't matter if the engine is junk.  My Lumina has a 3.1 liter V6 engine.  In easy terms, it has responsive power for when it is needed.  There is very little interior noise, which makes for a quiet ride on the freeway in Seattle's wonderful traffic.

Second, room is an issue for me.  I am kind of big, well over 6 feet tall and three hundred pounds.  I have to fit in a car if I am to drive it.  I have plenty of legroom, and a tilt of the seat to an angle gives me the necessary headroom.  It is kind of hard for me to fold myself inside the car, but once I am in, I am fine.  Averaged sized folks should not have this problem, and the rear seating is fine for an average adult.

This car is very functional for me.  I did not buy it for the glamour, but for good gas mileage, and low mechanical problems.  I get 24 miles per gallon on average, and my only problem in the last year was my alternator going out on me.  I was a bit surprised it went out before 60,000 miles, but what can you do?  Overall, I have been happy with the Lumina, and will look at Chevy products again when I am in the car market.<br><br>
