            This sporty sedan matches looks with an all wheel drive system that enables you to drive in any condition.  The 2.5L engine gives this car ample power for acceleration and passing and this vehicle grips the road well with every turn.  Like the outback, this sedan rides quietly and comfortably although the back can be a little cramped on long trips.  Even in this sedan version there is ample cargo space.  So if you want a dependable car that handles well in all weather conditions, yet you don't want the bulkiness of a wagon or sports utility truck, this is the ideal car for you.<br><br>
