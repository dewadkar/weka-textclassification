            Well, it was finally time to trade in the '96 Intrepid, she had over 128,000 good miles on her and was still in perfect running condition!  (I was sad; I loved that car, and cried when we traded her in.)

After numerous trips to car dealers, numerous phone calls from salesmen, it was time to make a decision between the Toyota Avalon, Nissan Maxima, and the Chrysler 300M.  Needless to say, we purchased the Chrysler 300M.

The setup of the instruments is similar to the '96 Intrepid we had, so that made getting use to the car a little easier for me.  All of the gauges are clearly visible for the driver, and a pleasing aqua color for nighttime driving.  

The seats are comfortable, both driver and passenger seats are power.  The driver's seat also has a manually adjusted lumbar support for those long drives.  The front seats are heated, which makes it nice when it's cold outside, and the car isn't warmed up yet (which doesn't take very long in the first place).  The back seats are comfortable also, and it's very roomy in the back for tall people, even if the front seats are moved back all the way.  

The memory for the seats is easy to use.  Just set the seat, mirrors, and the radio stations to you, select the memory button on the side of the seat, then select which driver you are.  The seat will also move back about 2" when the key is removed from the ignition (move forward the same amount when the car is started) to make it easier to get in and out of the car.

To me, there is a slight problem with the drivers seat.  It does not raise up enough for me to see the front end (not to be confused with moving up to reach the pedals).  This only causes a problem when parking; I have to scoot up in the seat to be able to see the front end of the car.

The trunk space in this car amazed me.  We travel a lot, and when we take our car, we need room in the trunk for our various pieces of luggage.  You could fit two extra large suitcases with room for more in the trunk if need be.  Also, you can fold the rear seats down for added room, incase you're hauling something that needs some extra length in the trunk.  You will also find a trunk release cord, to open the trunk from the inside incase of entrapment.

The power door locks are described as "rolling door locks", what this means, when the car is traveling at 15mph or above, the doors will automatically lock.  I like this feature also, since I do lock the doors when traveling.  The rolling door locks can be disabled.  There are also child-protection door locks on the rear doors.

Automatic dimming mirrors.  For nighttime driving of those annoying headlights, all mirrors on my vehicle dim.  The rear-view mirror and the side mirrors.  When this feature is added in the car, the side mirrors will also be heated, it automatically turns on when the rear window defrost is turned on.

The model we have has an overhead console, which operates the moon roof, garage door opener (if you have one) and will also give us information such as:  Temperature, compass direction, distance to empty, approximate gas mileage, trip time, and trip odometer.  Nice features to have when traveling.

When we purchased the car we had the navigation system (GPS) installed.  This unit is very useful for us, not only for our travels, but also for our business.  The navigation system is fairly easy to use.  You will want to know the address of where you are going, or an approximate point of interest to get you where you're going with the navigation system.   Once you establish and tell the system where you want to be, it will calculate and speak to you where to turn.  The read out display shows the map of where you are, and is pretty dead on accurate.  It also tells you how many miles till your next turn, or destination.  The navigation screen should be tilted back a little so that it would make it easier to see.

The stereo system is part of the navigation system in our car.  AM/FM, stereo (7 speakers throughout the car), equalizer.  This system has PTY (Program type) that will let you know what genre the station is that you are listening to.  This PTY only works if the radio station sends the signal. CD Player (6 CD changer in dash), which will display name of artist and title of song, and you can play CD-R/Rw's.  The system does not contain a cassette deck, you give this up if you have the navigation system.  There are also controls for the stereo on the steering wheel, so you do not have to remove your hands, to change stations, volume, CD, etc.

The performance of the car is extremely good.  Quick pickup on the hills, and great handling in the curves.  The car comes equipped with Autostick.  Autostick offers manual gear shifting capability to provide you with more control.  This feature is to help improve performance and give more control to the driver for, passing cars, city driving, slippery surfaces, and other types of situations we find ourselves in.  I find one problem with driving the car so far, and that is seeing out of the windows.  I feel the front seat headrests, and the back seat headrests, get in the way of me seeing out all of the windows totally.  My husband finds this to be a problem also, so I know it doesn't have anything to do with my height. 

The security system that came with the car is nice.  It will monitor the doors, trunk, and ignition for unauthorized operation.  If something triggers the system, it will signal for up to 18 minutes.  The first 3 minutes, the horn will sound and lights flash.  If the source of the trigger is still present, the lights will continue flashing for up to 15 more minutes.  The engine will not start until you disarm the system.  There is also a tamper alert built in.  If the horn sounds 3 times when you get in the car, it is telling you something has been tampered with.  

The car is gorgeous.  I feel the 300M has a sleek, sporty body style for a four door sedan.  Our car is Granite (dark gray), with gray leather interior, chrome wheels.  I could do without the chrome wheels, they weren't the first choice.  I do not like how you can see the brakes through the wheel; I do not think there is much protection for the brake system either.

If I feel the need to include more to the epinion, I will edit this.  However, I feel that I've included a lot of the features that are nice about this car.  I'd recommend this car for those that travel a lot and enjoy comfort and room.  Also for those that enjoy a well handling larger car.
