            I bought the Mazda MX-6 as my first car.  I got a very good deal on it used.  What makes me love this car so much, is how much it as endured since I have had it.  I have put this car through so much, and some how, it still runs, and very well.  Nobody told me I had to actually put oil in the car : ) so it went quite a while without, but it still works fine.  It runs when I have no gas in it.  It had no problems running through a foot and half of water.  It has flown over curbs, come to crashing stops, and still runs.  I will admit it has taken a beating superficially, but as far as the mechanics go, I am more than pleased.  A friend of mine spent twice as much on her first car at the same time, and has had numerous problems with it and spent a lot on repairs.  I have not had to have any repairs at all.  The only money I have spent has been on gas, oil, wiper fluid and new tires.
I have a 5-speed, and it accelerates very nicely.  It drives very smooth.  It now has 130,000 miles but you can't tell by driving it.  I definitely suggest this car for anyone (besides large families).  It is a perfect size too.  Not too large, but has a roomy back seat and trunk.  
Great great car.<br><br>
