            Hubby and I were in a Best Buy in April 2003.  He was looking at computer peripherals while I wandered around browsing the displays.  Then I thought to look at the digital cameras.  I'd been intrigued by the Mavica floppydisk concept; imagine my delight when I found they had a CD-R model available! I called hubby over and we did end up buying it.  

The CD400 has many features which may require a little bit of instruction manual study.  Luckily the manual is clear and concise.  I recommend experimenting with the settings to see the results.  A disc is cheap!

I took the camera on vacation to Southern California the first week of June.  I took over 600 photos all on one disc!  Boy, this beats film cameras and those "memory sticks" for other digital cameras!  

The bulkiness may be an issue for some people.  The Mavica cameras are about the size of an SLR camera. My own opinion is that the advantages of the Mavica make its bulkiness a non-issue.

BE CAREFUL with the viewscreen!  It is an LCD screen and is easily damaged.  I wish Sony made a clip-on cover for it but they don't.  If you have the camera strap around your neck, and there are buttons on your shirt, they may scratch or abrade the LCD screen.  

The number of images which you can fit on a disc will vary according to what image size you choose, and what resolution you choose.  

Shutter lag varies according to the type of photo you are taking.  Manual settings for long exposures need a second. The camera will take a few seconds to process data from long exposures.  This is normal. 

The Mavica MVC CD-400 uses a camcorder battery, which you charge while it is in the camera.  I highly recommend one or two spare batteries; the camera will use a lot of "juice" ESPECIALLY for flash photos and movie clips.

Movie clips??? Yes indeed.  The Mavica has a built-in microphone and will record a short movie clip in MP3 format.  

You can view the images in several ways.  First, you can use the review function on the camera and see them on the viewscreen.  Second, you can attach the supplied A/V cable to the camera and a TV.  Third, you can remove the completed disc from the camera and download the images to your computer.

This camera can do a whole lot.  Below is a partial list of features.
