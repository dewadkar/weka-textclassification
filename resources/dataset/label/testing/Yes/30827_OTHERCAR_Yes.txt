            The D 340 R is a very user friendly digital camera. Takes very good quality pictures for the price. With the optional Flash Disk Adapter as easy to download as copying files from one folder to another. This Camera is made for the casual photographer not made for heavy duty close up photo taking as there is no zoom except for digital zoom. 
  I chose the Olympus for the ease of operation and the format that photos are taken, JPG which are smaller files than the ever popular BMP file type and much easier to send as file attachments in e-mails. accessing the photos are as easy as accessing a folder on your computer.
  One of the downfalls I have seen with this particular camera is the on camera functions they are a little harder to work with such as when you want to delete pictures right on the camera, other cameras give the option to delete all or one whereas the Olympus 340 has to be deleted one photo at a time and that can add up to some time when you have several photos to delete up to 122 with an 8 megabyte memory card.
   I enjoy using this digital camera is a very good camera in the lower megapixal range and is comparable to any of the top line camera manufacturers camera's in the same megapixal range.
   Camera would work well for anyone who wants to be able to take pictures and e-mail on the spot (with optional Flash Disk Adapter) works well when i'm traveling and my wife will take pictures of our children and e-mail them to me as we are chatting on line.
  This camera with optional flash disk adapter is recommended for anyone who lives far away from family and likes to send pictures via e-mail.<br><br>
