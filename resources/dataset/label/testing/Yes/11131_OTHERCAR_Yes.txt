            I'm a veteran of Camrys, having owned a '92 and '96 Camry.  When the model changed for '97, I thought I was done with the car, because the styling was so poor and the famous Toyota over-engineering was suddenly lacking in the interior finish.  But for '02, another restyling took place, and I was smitten again.

I have a Camry XLE V6 which is now a year old.  Phantom Gray.  I must admit, it is a stellar "exec-mobile." Toyota may never be known for aggressive styling, but for this 43-year-old training director, that's just fine with me.  What interests me most about a car is that it feels good on the inside, drives quietly and competently, and won't keep me in the repair shop all the time.  

Toyota's just don't break.  The fit, finish, quality construction are all top notch.  I have had only one minor repair issue with the car; a rear strut assembly was replaced under warranty because it was squeaking on bumps.  Other than that, in one year and 25,000 miles, I've had scheduled maintenance only.  The factory spec tires (Goodyears) seem to be wearing fast, but unfortunately, that seems to be common with original tires these days.  I might put a set of Yokohamas on the car at about 35,000 miles.

The only option that I was denied on my Camry was the six-disc CD changer, which oddly "goes away" when you opt for the navigation system.  That's a shame.  Interestingly, I installed XM satellite radio in the car about three months ago, so I rarely use the CD now anyway.  Toyota should be providing an upgrade to the nav system DVDs at some point, although I have not heard details on this yet.

I do occasionally cringe when I see Camry LE's being driven by "little old ladies," and I know the reputation of the Camry is a bit dowdy.  But for me, it's a wonderfully engineered car, $10K less its Lexus ES300 twin, and it's eminently comfortable and responsive.

That's just me...what do you think?
