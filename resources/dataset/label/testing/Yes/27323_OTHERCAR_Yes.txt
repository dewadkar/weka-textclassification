            Ok I went to Las Vegas for a 10 day vacation. Now my whole trip was not for slots and drinks but for the desert and off-roading origonaly the plan was to rent a Hummer but that was shot down when I got fired 1 week before my trip and had less money to spend. So anyway I rented a Dodge Durango for the off-roading... don't tell my rent a car palce as I read that is against policy when i was 20 miles into the desert and scrathed the car to heck. Ok well back to the car since the second I picked it up I was in love its massive size and its sheer silence even with a V8 I believe this was the 5.7 liter. I am only but 19 so I ahd to have my grandmother rent it for me and she is a mini van lover but she fell for this car in 0 flat only problem she had was adjusting the electric seat.. hey she is a grandma.

Now the next day we woek up on a mission to go off-roading if you have ever been to nevada it is the rockiest dessert there is period this truck amazed me to death it was climbing 75% slopes with ease and in 2wd up rock near cliffs. I nailed a few rocks on the underside and it held its own but generally I was surprized at the items it went over and hills it climbed. We ended up in a very naroow valley and I nearly had a heart attack tring to manover these 8ft wide crevases with 90 degree turns and a super long SUV. As everyone knows tho this is one gas guzzuling machine we also took it to hte grand canyon a over 400 miles drive and had it packed full and got many complaints about the back seats that are clearly child only seats but I was driving and the drivers seat was dreamy. I spun tire jsut about everytime i hit a light while in vegas but one thing I did once spinng those tires was I blew one out real bad I nailed the gas as far as I could and it spun for nearly 1/2 mile. Then ever since that it was acting funny on control so I pulled over and boom sure enough my rear passenger tire was dead. So I thought even better for my epinion reveiw.. yes i was dreaming of writing a opinion on this the whole time. So I threw fix a flat in it in hopes it would stop leaking.. no luck so I got to try out the jack and spare tire setup and let me tell you it is one super easy setup this was the first time I had replaced a flayt and it took me less than 6 minutes. Now as for the rest of the car the paint didn't hold up too good btu i was scraping up against bushes in 8% humidity and 150 degrees in the sun. It has a 25 gallon tank and tank can go for about 400 miles this was doing 80 mph most the way to the grand canyon but it sucked gas bad in the desert going 15mph. Very roomy it was specially if you did not ahve the 3rd seat could fit a full chunk of plywood back there.. I think I was too set on the S in SUV in it to notice much else but i would highly recomend this car if you love to off-road and have a family otherwise get a Jeep Wrangler much cheaper.<br><br>
