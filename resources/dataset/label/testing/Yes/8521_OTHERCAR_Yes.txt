            There are lots of good things to be said for the 2001 Dodge Ram.  It has a massive bed, and a surprising amount of room in the cab.   The dash is well designed, and the center console serves as a great armrest.   I'm a small (5'3) female, and I find the seats and seatbelts very comfortable.  The high-utility factor of this truck certainly a plus.  Plan on spending an extra $500 for a bedliner to cut down on cosmetic scratches caused by normal usage.   The other aspect of this vehicle I really love is the feeling of safety and security.  Getting on the freeway is not an intimidating event because the Dodge Ram sits high enough and is large enough that people give it adequate space.  Despite all the positive things that can be said for this vehicle, the gas mileage is pitiful.  My truck gets about 14 miles per gallon in the city, and about 15 on the open road.  Ick!  On long trips I can actually SEE the gas gauge going down.  The other negative aspect of this vehicle comes from the difficulty of parking a vehicle this large.  Coming from a Toyota Tercel, I'm used to just whipping into a parking place.  I suppose the walk from the back of the parking lot is actually good for my health!
