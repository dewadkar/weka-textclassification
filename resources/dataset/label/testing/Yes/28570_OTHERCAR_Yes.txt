<TEXT>
            I know a lot of people who have the pleasure of driving one of these jeeps, and I myself have had the chance as well, but I believe that these jeeps could be a problem to new drivers. They do not get that well of gas per the mile and have a chance of flipping pretty easy. Do not get me wrong, I love the way they look, and I would not mind having one myself, but what I am trying to imply is that they could be a major hazard to a new driver.
If you really want to make them look good, you should try giving it a lift and put some big tires on it, but this would make the gas per the mile situation even worst. <br><br>
