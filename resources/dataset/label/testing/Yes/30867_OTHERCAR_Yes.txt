            My daughter was leaving for college, we needed another vehicle.  The pickup trucks were too big for puttering around town, a mid-size car did not offer me the option of transporting anything much larger than the weekly groceries.  After extensive research and test driving, I chose the Suzuki Grand Vitara Limited Edition.

I especially like the versatility it offers with the larger cargo area when the seats are folded down, and the door opening out towards the curb instead of towards the street or upwards.

I was impressed with the actual ride of the vehicle.  I have driven to Florida twice and was extremely comfortable for that long ride, and didn't feel that hard truck-like suspension nor the cushy &quot;boat on a wave&quot; of a luxury car.  The one DRAWBACK was how light the vehicle is....you definitely feel the effects of the wind on an open highway and you must be alert in handling the steering wheel in a windy area.<br><br>
