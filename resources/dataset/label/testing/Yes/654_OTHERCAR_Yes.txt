            I bought this product after trying it out on loan from work.  I was thrilled with this camera!  I had never used a digital camera before, and was sure I would spend most of my time figuring out how to use it.  I think I *might* have looked at the manual once or twice, but the camera was super easy to use, and use right.

The best part about this camera is its versatility.  You can use the regular viewfinder to take pictures, or you can use the LCD screen to take several in a row and pick the best one.  I liked the &quot;Slide Show&quot; feature . . . you can look at all the pictures you've taken and then decide which ones to keep or discard.

The picture quality is fantastic.  I've never seen a digital camera with such perfect pictures, even at full zoom.  

Download time can be a little slow with the serial connection, but it's worth it for the fantastic pictures you'll end up with.  That's why you should decide which pictures to keep and which ones to discard BEFORE you upload them to your computer for viewing, printing and emailing or archiving.

There was one drawback with this camera:  it sucks the life out of the batteries faster than anything I've ever seen, so make sure to bring a slew of extra batteries with you if you're going to have the camera on for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time.  The only way to conserve batteries is to turn off the LCD screen and use the viewfinder instead.

And with the new 990 model coming out at about $200 more, the 950 is a good bet.  There're only a few extra features in the 990, so don't feel you have to jump up to the newer model.<br><br>
