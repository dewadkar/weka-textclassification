            I've had my 2K for about 5 weeks now, and I can see where some folks are coming from re lack of torque. But as I found out after five weeks of crazy mountain road racing, the big secret is to keep the tach near the 6000 RPM range. 
I always make sure the revs are around the 5g mark, so when I hit the apex of a curve, I can put down the throttle, and the VTEC will kick in at 6000 just as I'm coming out of the corner. 
At 6g's, the VTEC kicks in and the push back into your seat is good. Sure it's not big block push, but's it's got me ahead of anything I've raced so far.  And that includes the new corvettes with their 5.7 litre monster motor.  
0-60 stats are 5.1 sec and the quarter mile is 13.7 (Road and Track)

Handling is another item all together...it's incredible!!! After all, what good is 400HP if you're unable to break 0.9 lateral G's?
The S2000 is up at 0.95 in stock trim. Breaking 1.0 G would be a breeze with a couple mods like lowering the car and adding strut bars I think. It's on my to do list so I'll let you all know down the road.

I chose the S2000 over the Porsche Boxter S, C2, C4, Corvette, NSX,
 BMW M Z3. The daily drivability of this car is great. I couldn't imagine I'd be able to cruze around the city day after day in a Ferrari F355, or a Lambo diablo.

I am not a dealer...I am just a guy who is really into cars, specifically 2 seater roadsters.
