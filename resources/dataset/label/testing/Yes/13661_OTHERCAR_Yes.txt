              I have to say this has to be the best bang for the buck for cars now a days! With performance cars going for 30,000 dollars and any luxuary performance cars going in the range of 50,000 its no wonder modern people (especially car crazy teenagers) just can't afford these wonderful automobiles!  Now for the record I am 18, I have been driving since I was 14 (we live in a small country town) and I have never been in a wreck or recived a ticket.  But strangely enough I have always been obsessed with performance cars! Speed, Acceleration, Horsepower, Torque! its enough to drive a broke adolestent teenager insane! Well enough about me...onto the wonderful Mark 8!
  
  I bought this car after after looking for all the performance cars I could in my price range ($6,000) F-bodies, 80's Corvettes, 3000GTs, Mustangs! Then one day while I was surfing the car message boards I came across a name I had not heard before, the Lincoln Mark VIII.  I did some digging and found out the specs 

4.6L DOHC, 32V - 280hp (290 - LSC) 285 LBS. of Torque
 
well after knowing enough about Ford modular engines I knew this was very close to the Mustang Cobra engine! Well wasn't I happy to know it was basically the same thing, only a 10 or so HP difference.  Also I came across another article from 93' in Popular Hot Rodding magazine showing the Lincoln taking the record at Boneville for an oustanding run of 181 mph with just the speed limiter and the mufflers removed!  Thats what got my attention.  Plus these cars are so sharp looking its to die for!  They have a aggressive front end with that sleek shape and handome rear hump that everyone loves!  After more searching I had found these cars prices had dropped significantly from the 40,000 dollars sticker that they once had!  I looked and looked and looked some more for a 93' - 96 Lincoln Mark VIII black on black for months!  All the time researching and finding out their wonderful appeal and performance capabilities!

One day on the wonderful message forum for the Lincoln www.markviii.org I found a man selling a Lincoln fitting the description I was looking for and he was only 1 hour away from my house!  Well after a short test ride I bought the car for an outstanding price of $4,900! This car had been only driven on long trips from Houston to Dallas...thats it, no city driving or anything.  Some rich man bought it for $42,000 and died. It was sold in a estate sell which the owner before me bought it in 99' for 11,000! In the 3 years the new owner had it he put on 20,000 miles with meticulos maintenance!  So I wasn't worried about the milleage that much!  Let me tell you Ford installed every single toy they had back than into this car!  Integrated Voice Activead Cell phone! Auto Dim mirrors, Air suspensione, Auto check features, dual exhaust...The WORKS!  Right when I got her home I took out her air silencer, I'm looking for performance so if you like a quite car don't do this.  But the silencer basically makes the Lincoln breathe through a straw as it were, so I was glad to get that out...WOW what a difference, the beast 4.6L came to life with a mighty roar and screetch of the tires!  By the way this car will chirp the tires on its 1-2 shift, and does burn outs on command ;).  This car is a Highway Hauler! I don't know very many cars that can pass this car!  Many have tried, Many have failed muuhhhaaaaa! Sorry :) This car I have to say is a bit of a dog from 0-30 but after that...hold on to your seat!  This thing will beat every single car I mentioned earlier! maybe not in the 1/4 but up top it will slaughter just about anything!  

Now I guess I need to point out some of the marks quircks as it seems.
 
1.) The transmission is a POS. Now you can remedey this by installing Mercon V transmission fluid and replacing the 1-2 accumulator piston and springs with the updated ones

2.) The air ride suspension...)now Lincoln got their act together on this one because they are no where near as bad as they used to be) the only thing you need to worry about is the air bags themselves which start to crack at about 100,000 miles or so.  They are pretty cheap compared to the older Marks VII air bags so be happy.  Plus you can move the lowering sensor down more so it lowers itself about 3inches instead of 1

3.) The headlights! Now my car dosen't have it as bad as the other Mark VIII's so this is just what I've read!  Ford crapped out on the headlights installing fake chrome inside to reflect the light!  Well after a couple of years this starts to wear off and the plastic lenses become yellow making the headlights about as good as a candle in a hurricane!  These can be replaced with new headlights for about $400 a side, or you can opt for HID headlights for about $100 more!

4.) Fuel consumption!  Now for the car being so big, and so powerful you would expect it to get horriable gas mileage.  Well on the contrary this car will get anywhere between 25-30 mpg on the highway and about 20-25 in the city, you can increase that about 3mpg if you instal a LMS performance chip at www.maxrpm.com plus it gives you about 15rwhp.  Yes you do have to use premium fuel because the compression rate is higher than 10:1 but you shouldn't mind spending a few extra dollars on gas to keep your car happy.

All in all the maintenance isn't that bad...especially if you learn to do the simple things yourself (oil change, fuel filter, Transmission Fluid, Plugs, wires) all of which it tells you how to do in the owners manual + you can always get a bunch of help from the wonderful people at www.MarkVIII.org!  So this is about it, sorry this is so long but I think Lincoln and the Mark VIII deserve this atleast.  If you want a high performance car wraped in leather with every single luxury item you can thing of for under $6,000 than this is it!
