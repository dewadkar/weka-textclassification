            I dont know about you, but lugging around a huge digital camera with me during everyday life and even when I have a specific reason to bring it somewhere is not extremely appealing to me. When I saw this tiny camera I couldnt beleive how cool it was. It was insanely tiny, at a reasonable price, and could hold a lot of pictures on an interal card.

While first playing around with the camera it was really fun. It has high and low definition pictures. It has a small video capture capacity. It also has a timer for hands free pictures.

The software is super easy to use and install. Though I cant honestly say that ive been able to get the live capture to work yet. I think its becuase of this anceint computer though, not faulty software.

The quality of the pictures is OK. Becuase of the fact that it has no flash you most deffinetly should be outside or at least in well lit conditions. The other problem is that you need to hold the camera very still in order to not get motion blur. This wouldnt be as big of a deal with a bigger camera but becuase of its small size holding it still with one hand can be challenging depending on your position. 

The video capture is pretty cool. You can take up to 120 seconds of non audio "clippage". Its fun if you want to send a small clip to a family member or something of that nature to entertain them. 

The beep when you turn the camera on and when you take a picture can be pretty annoying. I dont know why it feels the need to do that, its not like you cant tell when its turned on by the fact that the LCD lights up.

The battery life of the camera is deffinetly somewhat limited. I cant say that Ive timed exactly how long it is before it runs out of battery but it is most deffinetly shorter then most other digital cameras.

Overall the camera is great. Its effective for what it should be used for, random and fun pictures. If your a pro or advanced photographer this is not for you.
