            I finally got in the driver's seat of this vehicle.  It went beyond my expectations, and they were pretty high.  The car had 26 miles on it when I drove it, so when it was done the engine still had the smell of it's shipping plastic.  Although I didn't push the limit of the car by any means, it was still fun to drive.

The car seemed very sturdy.  With the soft top up, it didn't even seem like I was in a convertible.  I didn't hear or feel any airflow through the top.  Everything felt like it was in the right place.  The stick goes directly to the transmission, it has no linkage whatsoever.  It also has a really short throw between gears, I found myself moving my wrist instead of my arm.  I really hesitated to use 6th gear, since I had never driven anything but a 5-speed, I kept thinking I was going to throw it in reverse.  The throttle is very responsive, and didn't stick at all.  The clutch acted normally, nothing much different from any other car I've driven.  The brakes worked really well. In my other car ('97 Honda Civic HX) I have a subwoofer box unmounted in the trunk, so I try not to slam the brakes much, however, this car had nothing in it but me, and when I hit the brakes, we stopped.  Steering was nice as well.  This is my first car with electronic assisted steering, and it felt very smooth.  Going 10 mph taking a 90 degree right turn was about the same as taking it at 30 mph.

I did feel the bumps in the road, but I believe they meant for it to be that way.  It's not bumpy to the point it's uncomfortable, but bumpy enough to where you know what's going on down on the road.

The seats were very comfortable, but I'm a small person.  I can see how these seats would be cramped for a larger person, but they conformed great for me.

The dash is laid out well.  The RPM meter looks great, stretching a half-oval across the top, showing the very small red area between 9000 and 10000.  I drove it at night and it was very easy to see.  I have not driven it during the day yet, but I've seen it, and it still seems very readable.

The lights are awesome, you can see quite a ways ahead of you, and can see a VERY definite line created by the lights.  The high-beams light up the whole area.  The turn signals work, yes, they work, please, please use them. (sorry I have a thing about turn signals).

The engine start button is fun, and a great feature for bragging rights.  Turn the key, hit the button, and brrooom, there it goes.  The roof is very fast too.  Roof goes up, roof goes down. I forgot to time it, but it could easily be done when stopped a a red light. And it seals perfect from what I could tell.

Well enough about it's operability, as far as I could tell, it's flawless.

As far as storage space goes, well, it's a roadster.  You have a small glove box between the seats, and you have a small trunk.  It can fit about 2 big bags, or one full sized golf bag.

From the front, you can't beat the look of the car.  It looks like it's about to eat you.  At first I didn't like the back, mainly because of the lights, but I really came around to it.  The pipes in the back add to the aggressive look of the whole car.

I bought this car because I've never been disappointed by Honda, and have been looking forward to it for quite some time.  I wouldn't recommend having it as your primary car, but if you have another car, and can afford this one, well, then why don't you already have one?!

Comments on opinion details:
Reliability: 5 - I've had the car for all of a day, but the maintenance in the manual looks the same as all other Honda's, which I don't think I even need to say is great.
Comfort: 4 - I'd really give it a 5, but it seems the car was made for me, so anyone else might not fit right.
Quality: 4 - It's a quiet ride, but you can hear the engine, and it sounds good.
Easy to Take Top Down: 5 - The only way it could be easier is if the top were telepathically linked to you.
Roominess: 5 - Very roomy, not in back though.  There is no back seat, but if you can get yourself comfortable back there, more power to you.<br><br>
