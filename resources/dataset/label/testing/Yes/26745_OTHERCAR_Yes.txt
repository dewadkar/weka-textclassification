            We bought this digital camera so we could have another toy for our computer, not to mention get digital clarity....

Boy are we totally satisfied customers.... This camera really proved what it could do the night I totalled my car, and my honey had to take shots of it around 10:30 PM in the compound yard in the pouring rain....

You would never have known it was incliment weather... The shots came out so perfectly clear it was amazing.  These pictures came out so perfect and clear....  The perfection to detail and clarity even when zooming in to look at them after they had uploaded to the computer was fantastic.

If you purchase this camera, you will not be disappointed....  It is very easy to use, and even someone who cannot focus a regular camera will take exceptional shots with this...

I extremely enjoy the view function... After taking a shot, you can automatically look at what you took a picture of, and if it's garbage you can send to the garbage can and get rid of it....

I think you owe to yourself to compare the Olympus with the Cannon, and Polaroid cameras, and I think you will find the Olympus to be the better value, since it comes automatic with a 8 meg card and the others only come with 4 megs.
