            I bought this camera to upgrade from a .3 mega pixel (600x480) digital which had terrible picture quality. I've had the D-460 for 3 weeks now and have excellent results with it. The ability to adjust the ISO is a real plus. Night shots come out good but a bit grainy which is typical of higher ISO settings. The higher ISO settings are great for daytime stop action shots. The 3x &quot;optical&quot; zoom is a BIG improvement over the lesser &quot;digital&quot; zoom of other cameras. Plus, there is a 2x digital zoom on the D-460 just in case you NEED to get a tighter shot at the expense of some quality. Between the 3x optical and the 2x digital zooms, you have in effect, a 6x zoom system on this camera. The ability to save photos in uncompressed &quot;TIFF&quot; format is great when wanting the best quality photo you can get. Compression done later in a photo program like Photoshop etc... has much less (compression)artifacts than if it were compressed in the camera, size for size. The problem is, you can only fit 2 photos in TIFF format on the O.E.M. 8MEG memory card that comes with the camera. A larger memory card is a must when shooting &quot;TIFF&quot; photos. When shooting in the Panorama mode, you must use &quot;Olympus&quot; brand Compact Flash Memory. Other brands will not work. The &quot;macro&quot; setting goes down to 8&quot; which is fine for most applications. There is a soft mode setting for &quot;softer&quot; looking photos like when taking a close up portraiture. I prefer to take a standard photo and soften it with a &quot;Gaussian Blur&quot; in Paintshop Pro, which allows me to choose the amount of blur I want. I bought a NiCad Battery charger and 4 rechargeable batteries to save money. The Lithium batteries that came with the camera are used as back-ups in case the NiCads die on me. The battery life on the NiCads are very good if you use the LCD display to a minimum. I almost always use the view finder to take photos and use the LCD for the mode settings. The only time I use the LCD to take photos is when taking Macro pictures so I get the subject properly framed. Because of parallax, the viewfinder and the camera lens (LCD view) don't align correctly at macro distances. The controls for the camera are pretty easy to get used to and somewhat intuitive. The LCD display on the back is clear and has very good resolution. I've taken some photos with this camera and tweaked them a bit with Photoshop 5.0 and Paintshop Pro, and have been very satisfied with the results. I've even sent some of the pics into an online photo contest. I wish I could upload a couple of the photos I've taken with the camera, but I don't see any where to do it. The only thing missing in this package is USB upload capable and a 110v power supply. A $10.00 6vdc power supply from Radio Shack did the job nicely. A carrying case would be nice but that's not really too important. I keep the camera in a backpack with me all the time so I'll be ready for that once in a lifetime shot... I highly recommend the Olympus D-460 to anyone in the market for a $400 range camera (less when bought online).<br><br>
