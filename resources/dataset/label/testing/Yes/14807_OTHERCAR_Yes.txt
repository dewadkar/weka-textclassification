            The 1991 Mercury Cougar XR7 is a wonderful car. The engine is a V8-302 with a 5.0 liter fuel injection system. Weight at stock production is around 3,800lbs, a bit heavy for a car of this size and class, but with the engine it has absolutely no problem getting up to speed.

Has an automatic transmission with manual first-gear and overdrive options.

Provides a wonderful, smooth ride with rear-wheel drive. Very comfortable seats. Automatic moving seats on driver's side, manual on passenger. May lack room in the back for bigger people, but fine for kids, or mid-sized people 6 feet and below. All the standard options, including cruise control, AC, heat, radio/cassette stereo system, power windows, steering, mirrors, & seats.
