            With all the awards that Ford Motor Company has won in Europe and North America for its Ford Focus 2000, we can only predict the unveiling of the the technological experience and cutting-edge technology and design which will mark the new generation of Ford vehicles.  Now, I want you to read this disclaimer.  I was never impressed with Ford vehicles until I laid eyes on the new Ford Focus 2000 while researching a good car for my wife.  The Ford Focus came out last year.  It was at about the same time my wife and I were checking the market for a new vehicle.  Since that time, I have been keeping track of the performance award this new Ford jewel has garnered.  So far, it has left me with a lasting first impression.

What I like about this car is its appealing European design.  (I grew up loving Peugeot etc. It has a universal appeal and feel to it.  This is probably why it has been doing so well in Europe where it is rated one of the top European cars by a select jury of European motoring journalists.  I can remember my wife's and children's eyes when they sat in it during our test-driving tour.  It was a very fantastic and superb feeling.  You can't ask for more.  This car is a great package that comes with excellent features.  If you are a car buff or just a casual driver, without any doubt you will fall in love with it too.

You know how tough this fight can be to grab the first spot.  The European and North American auto writers and journalists had a tough job in their hands.  Just remember this job still remains very subjective.  After comparing this vehicle with many others, you will be able to make up your own mind.  You may end up being impressed just like I have been.  You may even add some objectivity to the whole selection process.

If Ford continues with this new century type of technology, it will win me over.  I strongly stand behind this car.  I am able to recommend it to you if you are looking for a decent and reliable family car.<br><br>
