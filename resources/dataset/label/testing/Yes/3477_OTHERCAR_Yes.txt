            I recently purchased my first Subaru - the LL Bean Edition.  Previously I would not even consider a class of cars so notoriously underpowered. 

I was amazed at the mechanical systems of this car.  It is the smoothest riding, yet best handling car I have ever owned (13 and counting). The AWD is top-notch yet completely unnoticable under normal conditions.  The variable assist power steering is the first I have ever seen where they got it right.  Antilock breaks work very well with minimum noise and vibration. The 6 cylinder's power is ample and the transmission is smooth. I am highly critical of my cars, and the engineers on this one were geniuses.  Two more items of special note: the mahagony and leather steering wheel is reaalllly nice. It is just the right size and width. Also, the car is rock solid.  The doors are heavy and nothing appears to be cheap or flimsy. This car really is built better than you would first think of a small, hatchback looking thing. 

Unfortunately the rest of the designers were high school shop class dropouts. Where to begin...

The tilt wheel is a joke.  I am tall and it is weird and does not permit enough travel for me to get my knees past.  It is not easily adjusted like EVERY OTHER tilt wheel I have ever seen. The shift knob is some odd conflagration where you have to jag in and out to move between gears rather than just pressing a button on the knob like all other cars.  The console cupholder is too small.  The cupholder on the dash is just plain goofy.  The premium stereo with add on subwoofer is crap. Rather than applying a low frequency filter to the main speakers they just shunt off the signal to the subwoofer.  The net effect is that to get the bass out of the sub, you have to turn up the stereo which in turn overdrives the main speakers, which makes the whole thing sound bad.  It's sad considering that a $20 part would make a $500 stereo sound 5 times better. The windshield wiper defrosters do not work which is ashame since the design of the windshield causes snow to pile up under the wipers.  The seats take forever to heat up. The fog light covers fall off when you hit a hard bump. Don't think for a second that you are taking this car (and I emphasize CAR) offroad like you see in the commercials.  It is a civilized, on-road machine. 

However; my biggest complaint (drum roll please...) is the lack of tinted windows.  Not only is it not offered as an option on a $30k car, but they put these stupid trim decals on all the rear windows effectively preventing after market window tinting.  

I have never seen a car that was such a radical dichotomy of failure and success. 

I must conditionalize all these comments with the fact that up to this point, I have driven nothing but American brand cars.  Perhaps all Japanese designed cars have odd tilt wheels and bad stereos, but I kind of doubt it.
