            The proverbial station wagon! My children call our suburban the cool version of the station wagon. We laugh about it. Although we have not owned a SW since my oldest was a baby, twenty years ago. We would never go back to one either. 

The suburban offers so much, like the dual air/heat. You can control the air blowing on you one way or the other. But, the options in the front seat are not quite so pleasurable. The passenger tends to freeze while the driver is comfortable. And, even closing the vents does not help as they do not close tight enough.This is something which needs to be worked on in the manufacturer. 

The room is great. We have five children and our van just was not big enough for all of us. We do a lot of traveling as we are War Between the States Re-enactors and thus pull a trailer. Which the burb does a great job at pulling.

The seats are so comfortable and we are able to stand the long sitting of our traveling due to this luxury. Just wish we could figure out how to get the pillow to stay in place while we sleep sitting up. The front seats recline nicely. 

One problem we have incurred with the suburban is my daughter gets car sick in any seat but the front. So, needless to say, mom is stuck in the back. This is a confirmed condition on her part and has little to do with her blackmailing just to get the front seat as some might think. She does not get sick in our van. It is either the lack of window's in the third seat or the tinting of the windows. Not sure. Thus she is not really fond of our burb.

We thought of selling it, and purchasing a 4X4, but will have to wait on this venture, unless someone is interested in it?
