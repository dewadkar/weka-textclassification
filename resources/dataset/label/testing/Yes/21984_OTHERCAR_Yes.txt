            My parent purchased their first Lexus in 1990--a silver LS400.  Now, 10 years later, they have passed the Lexus down to me and I have been driving it for approximately 3 years now.  

The Lexus is one of the smoothest rides around.  Even after nearly 130,000 miles, the car still handles beautifully.  Both responsive, and elegantly crafted, I can't imagine driving any other car.

Perhaps the best thing about the Lexus, besides its handling or style, is its dependability.  In 10 years, the car hasn't given my family any major trouble.  It left me stranded on the roadside only once--due to the overheating of the transmission.  The car has been relatively resistant to abuse as well.  My father once backed his Mercedes into the side of my Lexus, yet the car doesn't show any real signs of damage.  Over the years, the Lexus has been side swiped by a truck, has had the garage door come down on its trunk, and has had it's antenna snapped into two by a tree.  But, if you look at my car, it doesn't register the wear and tear of ten years.  

In the interior of the car, the leather on the passenger side has began to crack, the air conditioning just recently has begun to fail, but the fact that it has lasted such a long time is testament to the durability of the car.  There have been no major unfixable damages.

In fact, our family has become so infatuated with the Lexus that both my mother and brother have bought themselves a Lexus GS400.  With extra wide wheels, a navigation system, and the works, they think of it as not only a tool but a toy.  My father, who recently bought himself a Mercedes S class sedan even sneaks my mom's GS400 out for a spin.  One of the snazzy features of the GS400 is that the manual shift mode brings together the best of both the automatic and the stick-shift worlds. 

One thing to watch out for, is that the Lexus sits very low and so if you're not careful, you're prone to scrape the bottom of the car against a drive way.  

I really don't have any complaints against this car.  I love its design as well.  It is a paragon of what a luxury car should be.  It absolutely spoils you.<br><br>
