            Why would I bother writing a review of a car that is 15 years old? There are fewer of these cars on the road as each day goes by and some states will start considering a 1987 car to be an "antique" in just a few more years.

But the fact is that my 1987 Audi 5000S Quattro has been a trusted friend in my household for almost 10 years. You still see these (and models from 1986 and 1988) listed in the classifieds for surprisingly small amounts of money for what is a very high-tech car.

I bought the car for a laughably low $6,700 in 1993 with 42,000 miles and I now have 157,000 miles on it.

My Audi 5000S Quattro is a four-door sedan with a 2.3-liter five-cylinder engine. The engine is rated at 130 HP. Quattro is Audi's all-wheel-drive system and it is more sophisticated in the 1987 Audi than it is in current Audis -- or even in my 1995 Subaru.

The 1987 Audi 5000S Quattro is filled with electrical accessories, including a power sunroof, power seats (with four memories), power windows and power door locks. In 1987, the Quattro system was available with only a five-speed standard transmission -- no automatic -- which is fine by me.

In addition, my 1987 Audi has four-wheel disk brakes and an anti-lock braking system. It has passenger map lights, cruise control, a fascinating in-dash computer system and excellent gauges that have never given me a moment's trouble. The gas-charged hood supports let me lift the hood without fussing with a prop rod. Believe it or not, the battery is under the back seat.

The car has a cavernous trunk and a capacious gas tank. The cloth-covered seats are comfortable, if a little flat, and the back seat is the most spacious that I have ever had in a car. With 157,000 miles on the odometer, there have been no tears in the upholstery and no broken seat hardware.

The gas tank holds about 22 gallons, which when combined with the typical 25 miles per gallon that I usually get, gives me a range of more than 500 miles. It's even better on the highway -- it's not unusual to go 450 miles between fillups during a road trip with a comfortable amount of gas still left in the tank.

The Audi 5000S Quattro is an excellent car for a road trip and not just because of its decent milage and excellent range. It is quiet, comfortable and the Audi's overall solid construction gives me a sense of security that I don't get in my newer Subaru Legacy.

In nearly 10 years and 115,000 miles of use, the Audi has never left me stranded. Sure, maintenance problems have come up but none so severe that I couldn't safely drive the car home.

Over the years I have replaced the catalytic converter, several electrical switches, done two complete brake jobs (including rotors), did a valve job, replaced the timing belt three times, done numerous tuneups, replaced a rubber hose assembly that was leaking vacuum, replaced shocks and shock bushings all around, replaced wheel bearings and CV joint boots, replaced the cruise control and air conditioning control modules, and replaced a power window motor assembly that failed (with the window down, of course) in December. I replaced it on Christmas Day a few years ago.

After 157,000 miles, the car is on its original clutch. The body hardware (door handles, light lenses, locks, hinges, etc.) are all original and in good condition.

I have done most of the work myself and the Audi 5000S is fairly easy to work on. Even pulling the cylinder head off for a valve job was not that tough.

After 15 years, the car is still solid underneath with no sign of body or chassis rust. The paint is original and looks great after one of its two-a-year waxings.

The engine could use more power -- This car begs for a 200 HP six-cylinder engine. However, the trusty five-cylinder engine gets me where I want to go with decent economy. It will lose a bit of speed up moderate hills but I usually don't have to shift down.

The car still has its original air conditioning components and they work fine. However, the car has a sophisticated computer-controlled heating and cooling system that can have a mind of its own. When I got the car, the A/C would mostly be directed to the windshield defroster outlets. I replaced the A/C control module and that fixed that. A couple of years later, the car started to provide tepid air when what I wanted was cool outside air. This slightly heated air was there even if I switched on the A/C. Even after taking this to an Audi dealer to diagnose, I found that the only fix is to lift the hood and manually force the heater valve into the "off" position. This is easy to do and I keep it in this position all summer. This, believe it or not, is the biggest gripe I have with the car.

One more gripe: The car could use a cupholder!

My Audi uses about a quart of oil every 600 miles. It's clear that some of it leaks -- and I don't know from where -- but some is apparently burned, although the exhaust has no smoke. I was hoping that my recent valve job would cure this and it did push oil consumption back by 100-200 miles. But it is still higher than it should be. I must assume that the oil is getting past the piston rings.

Although this car is 15 years old, parts are still easily available through Audi dealers and from a wide range of mail-order companies. The cost of parts is no better or worse than my old Ford Ranger pickup.

Finally, the Quattro system... this is an outstanding feature of Audis and it gives me a strong sense of well being when I drive this car. My home is up a steep, bumpy, private dirt road in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and the 5000S Quattro is the envy of my neighbors. I can drive up the hill with no wheel spinning, even with patches of snow and ice on the road. In fact, one of my neighbors bought an Audi with Quattro (which he loves!) after seeing the ease with which I made it up the road.

I have also (but no longer) owned an 1986 Audi 4000 Quattro and that was a more sporty car than the 5000. But it developed undiagnosable engine problems at about 120,000 miles, so I got rid of it. The 1987 Audi 5000S Quattro soldiers on with a sense of invulnerability and still looks about as modern as most other cars on the road.

If you enjoy doing your own car work, you can pick up an Audi 5000S Quattro for about $2,500 in the classifieds. With some thoughtful maintenance and parts replacement (shocks, brakes, filters, fluids and whatever might be necessary), you could end up with a reliable, comfortable and very secure car for less than $4,000.
