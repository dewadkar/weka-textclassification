            The Dodge Ram 2500 is the best truck to own if you want to pull things.  I bought it because I needed to pull a boat, and it pulls great.  The truck picks up speed quickly.  It's also a good truck for the family.  My Dodge has a back seat.  I have little brothers and sisters that ride in the back and it's roomy.  They have a cup holder for the kids in the back, and a storage place under the back seat, which is really convenient.  The front seats are also very roomy and comfortable.  There's a passenger airbag that you can turn off when there's kids sitting in the front with you.  I believe that if someone really was looking for a nice looking and comfortable car they should buy the Dodge Ram 2500.  If you weren't thinking of pulling things, I would suggest to get the Dodge Ram 1500 series.  I really believe that I made a good choice buying the Dodge Ram.  One look in it and you'd believe me.<br><br>
