            I bought this vehicle because at the time, it was the only option I had.  I find out that I really do love this car and I do not regret buying it.  It is a white Plymouth Laser RS Turbo. The only problem I have with it is that it burns oil and I have to keep putting oil in it frequently.  Other than that, I love it.  The car is totally loaded, 125,000 miles and still ticking with no major problems.  The speed is incredible.  This car is registered at 145, and no, I haven't tried it.  The car is actually fun to drive.  I never thought that I would drive a 5 speed, but the speed this car has, has me hooked.  I will be sad when it eventually does die on me. The gas mileage is good as well.

I have done much research on this car and find that many of them will go almost 300,000 miles before breaking down for good.  This car was made to compete with the Probe and other models.  I recommend that if you are looking for a car and you see one of these, go for it, especially if you like speed.  The only thing is, you have to watch the timing belt because if it breaks, all the valves will be bent. So do not procrastinate about changing the timing belt when it is time to do so.  Good maintenance will give this car a long life.

Another thing is the location of the console.  The location of the console makes it difficult to place that cup of coffe in the cupholders and be able to reach for it safely.  I have to drive with my drinks between my legs because the console is back a little bit, and has a lid that has to be lifted up.  The back seat is rather small as well.  Hope  all of this helps.<br><br>
