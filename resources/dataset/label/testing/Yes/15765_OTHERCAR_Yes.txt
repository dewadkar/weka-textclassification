            Being one of the original SUV's there is no lack of spare parts for the classic jeep cherokee. i've owned two used jeeps my main reason for purchasing was the favorable price for used jeeps. Imports are more costly and since their are lots of jeeps around there is a ready availability of used vehicles. 
The vehicle has performed well for daily commuting and long trips. its been roomy enough for me to sleep in the back on trips to the mt. shasta region. There is plenty of horsepower and never have had issues when i needed quick acceleration. major pitfalls with the jeep is their paint job i currently have a '92 that is losing its paint rather rapidly. there are certain other things that could have been better handled. for example, the piston supports for the rear door do give out. 
i thouroughly enjoy this vehicle because of simple physics &quot;bigger is better&quot; i personally find it entertaining to watch the subcompact think they can save more time dodging around me and passing the twenty some other cars in front of me because they think i'm holding up the traffic.
if you want cheap insurance buy an suv. by the way these things do hit the old pocketbook when gas prices are high<br><br>
