            We're coming on 6 months with our 1999 Accord LX.  Excellent car, typical Honda, and great to drive.  However, we belive that with this model line, Honda has become complacent with its design style and options list.

We have been Accord owners since 1980 --owning a new one every 2 years since then, and while we are generally LXi and EX owners, we opted for this year's LX model in anticipation of a bit more expensive, but probably worth-it 2001/2002 redesign.

There isn't much to say about the superb:  Honda fit and finish, paint/exterior quality, interior quality, and overall look that this is definitely the evolution of a great model line.

We feel the paint quality, while still superior to competitors, lacks the deep multi-step appearance our previous Accords had.  That may be because of more environmentally-friendly processes, but we feel the R&amp;D effort Honda has used on other items has yielded better solutions.

We always anticipate the newly-designed Accords after their SE models, and this year is no exception.  It seems, though, that the models which we favored most (our 1994 EX and 1997 SE) were lost in the translation to this year's re-skin.  In fact, we think this model Accord looks more like a redesign of the older 1990/1992 variations (especially since it has come back with a rear quarter window).  We are hoping the redesign after this model-set is better and less bland.  

That it matters is debatable, but all of our Accords (except our 1997 SE) were built in Japan with a VIN number beginning with J.  And we think quality and resale appeal is better as opposed to those beginning with a 1, but that's as much as our opinion matters; we're not certain as to what difference the origin of the car makes.  The argument we have about owning a VIN-car J vs. a VIN-car 1, is one that wonders why a car made 3000 miles from the nearest US shore should cost the same as one made in the midwest.  We feel the premium one might pay for owning a Honda should be directly related to its origin; and rather, if a customer purchases an Accord or any Honda made in America, the price should be adjusted.

As compared to a 98 model our parents own, the seats are better, and the horizontal sew-patterns are much more Honda; a great improvement over the 98's vertical style, Chevy Malibu-looking stitching.

The interior is great and VERY Honda.  However, we believe the driving heights is less Honda in style and more American and we do not like that.  We are concerned that the bar-type, key-resettable Maintenance window is gone.  That was something we came to rely on and not having that makes the Accord seem more bland and generic than we would prefer.

Another interior feature we found to be useful over the years but has mysteriously disappeared with this model is the recall button for the clock.  In older Accord models (as recent as 1997) the recall button on the clock could be used to see the time even without the key in the ignition.

The LX 4-cylinder engine we have is sufficient, and the transmission smooth.  We have yet to own a V6 Honda and find their venerable 4-cylinders do the trick here in stop/go and traffic-happy Hawaii.

Actually, we have compared our Accord to various cars that our friends own and we have found:
 - Our Accord is quieter and tighter in steering and road feel than a Lexus ES300.
 - Our Accord has a smoother transmission than the Mazda Millennia.
 - Our Accord looks less cheap inside than a Mercury Mystique.

Now that we are coming on our 20th year of owning Hondas, and more than 10 cars later, we would recommend ANY Honda vehicle to anyone; and more specifically an Accord.  In college, the joke was that as long as a Honda got regular oil changes and a minor timing adjustment, they were bulletproof.  We believe that.

The race that always seems to come up between the Ford Taurus and the Accord is laughable.  We believe the Taurus is a very different car and people who are looking for the American-type engine oomph with a little more hip room should stick to the Taurus or comparable GM or Chrysler models.  Drivers who prefer better build quality, almost-bulletproof reliability, and a somewhat sportier drive should buy Honda.  We believe Honda is to the market of Japanese cars what BMW is to the market of European cars.  Honda is sporty, yet can accommodate; able, yet can sip gas; and attractive, yet mass-produced.

Honda has our vote.  Now if only Honda would realize that if they combine the qualities their faithful buyers need and want with the qualities they could use to attract new buyers, they could actually beat Ford at the race even without any fleet-type sales.
