            The GMC Suburban is one of the most practical cars ever made.  Its possibilities are endless.  I recently took a road trip with some friends, and discovered that you can comfortably fit eight people and all of their ski equipment.  The car can handle the treacherous roads covered by a strong noreaster.  

The Suburban is a great family car, that can accommodate more than a few children.  Parents, if you want to hear less screaming and complaining, i strongly suggest that you consider investing in this car.

Unfortunately there are a few minor downfalls of this great automobile.  The car is fairly expensive in comparison to smaller SUV's.  If you can successfully parallel park this car on the first try, you deserve a medal.  The car is quite large and does not get many miles per gallon.  Even with all of this being said, I believe that this car is worth the money you put into it, and will last you a long time.<br><br>
