            We bought our 1998 V70 Cross Country in March of 2002.  We were looking to replace a leased Jeep Grand Cherokee and didn't want another SUV but wanted AWD.  Without being long-winded, here's my opinion of the Volvo:

Engine: Plenty of power from the 2.4L turbo to merge and pass on the Interstate, not so much power that the car torque-steers.

Transmission: Snappy shifts are sporty, not silky-smooth.  

Exterior: Fit and finish are beautiful, paint is a glossy black.  The plasticky trim parts try to make it look sort of SUV-like with moderate success.

Interior: Again, fit and finish are beautiful, leather is supple and soft, wood is nicely done, and seats are the most comfortable you'll sit in anywhere (including your house).  Space is good all around.

Ergonomics: Interior controls layout is typical Swedish hard-to-learn but easy-to-remember.  Buttons, switches, and knobs have a very high-quality feel.

Cons:  These cars have a tendency to have electrical quirks, especially bulbs that either burn out or short out.  So far only non-essential bulbs that are cheap and/or easy to replace, but when the speedometer or radio or hvac control lights go bad, that gets expensive in a big hurry.

So far, we love our V70 Cross Country.  It's a fabulous car to drive around town or on the highway, it looks rich and runs flawlessly, and we feel very safe regardless of the conditions.  That's what we were looking for and we found it.
