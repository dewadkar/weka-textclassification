            I do considerable research before I buy a car.  My aim was to get something that was fun to drive, reliable, took regular gas, and wasn't too hard on the eyes.  I have the SE model,  which comes with a 180 watt CD player, 16 inch alloy wheels, 145 HP, 5 speed, power locks, windows, security system, spoiler, a sunroof and 4 wheel disk brakes.  The SE is several thousand dollars more expensive than the XE and GXE models, but it's very well equipped.  The only things I miss are ABS (impossible to find) and side impact protection.  The 4 wheel disk brakes work very well.  Although it doesn't compare to a Honda Prelude or Acura Integra in terms of performance, it also doesn't take high test gas, is about 5-8 K cheaper, and it's very forgiving to drive.  The handling is excellent, and acceleration is better than most cars in this class.  

Initially, I planned on getting a Hyundai Elantra, but I found the Sentra to be much more solid and the performance better.  It also has a timing chain vice a timing belt, which will save some money down the road.  It's a hoot to drive.  In terms of reliability, I traded an Infiniti G20 for it.  the G20 had 160,000 miles on it with very little engine work (valve cover gasket at 120K).  The Sentra SE has the same engine as the G20, so I'm hoping the reliability will be similar.  The Sentra is also much lighter than the G20, so the mileage and performance are better.  I find it very quiet at highway speeds, even with the sunroof open.  The CD player is amazing.  I'm not a big stereo buff, but it's the best factory installed stereo I've ever heard.  Appearance is a bit weak, but I drive a bit fast, so I feel it's better not to have something too flashy so as to avoid the long arm of the law.  It isn't ugly, just a bit plain.  It's one of the few cars I can think of where the spoiler actually improves the looks without making it look like a boy-racer car.
Interior space isn't great, but it has a lot of head room for the driver.  As my back seat passengers are 5 and 7, it has adequate room for my purposes.  The trunk is sizable, but the struts (hinges?) intrude into the trunk area.  Fit and finish are perfect, and so far, I've had no rattles and nothings has fallen off.  My mileage has been about 33, but I'm still driving it nicely until it gets a few thousand miles on it.  I will update this opinion as I get better acquainted with the vehicle.  I hope this helps you. 

Quicky update:  We had our first snow of the year (4 inches), and I'm happy to say that the Sentra is a very capable winter vehicle, even with the standard 16 inch tires that came with the vehicle.  I live in a very remote and hilly area, and was concerned that I would have difficulty, but it handled well, didn't slide, and stopped and started on hills just fine.
