            My mother bought a brand new Saturn 3 Door Coupe last year, and I really like the car, I often rather drive hers than my Grand AM.  The car has great pick up, mileage, and the quietest ride I've ever had, but I am 6'1&quot; and I hate to sit in the back seat.  The car, seems to have been made for a shorter person, because I have absolutely no head room and I'm forced to sit across the back seat to fit comfortably.

However, it is only the back seat that I have any real problems with, the front is quite roomy, and with the ability to adjust the firmness of the seat back, I always have a comfortable ride.  With the exception of this one problem the car is perfect, in fact my mother had driven it for the first year before ever realizing she had to bring it for an oil change.  If you are looking for a reliable car, not only the SC, but any Saturn is the way to go.<br><br>
