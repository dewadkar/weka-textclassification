            First Things first - this car has virtually no luggage space. If there is only two of you, it will be less of a concern, as the rear seat neatly and simply folds up, thanks to a handle on the back of the seat, easily accessible from inside or outside the vehicle. The seat can be also be lifted out, giving you valuable space for all you "stuff". However if you have even one child - you have room in the trunk for baby bag; but you wont get the pram in there! 

So, I would say it has to be the second car option for a family. Mine is - one great big gas guzzling for wheel drive as the main car, and a small gas guzzling four wheel drive as the second car. What I hear you cry? The wrangler may be small but the 150KW 300nm 4.0 engine drinks the fuel at the same rate my 3.2lites 2.5 ton vehicle does. In part it is due to the old fashioned push rod straight six engine. 

However, every year they build these things, they get better. So if you think my review is bagging this vehicle think again &#150 you have to understand what you will be buying &#150 its not very practical &#150 its running costs are high &#150 BUT &#150 this vehicle is the most fun of any vehicle I have owned. 

The 2003 model has a few updates, including a new sound system which is a welcome improvement &#150 the overhead sound bar does a great job, and there is little distortion when you crank it up with the hood down. 

There is plenty of driver and passenger space, and enough legroom in the back for adults. The seats are extremely comfortable, and improvements to the hood make it quicker to drop and put up, and also seem to have reduced wind noise. I think the stiffer construction of the hood has definitely reduced the &#147flapping&#148 evident on wind noise. The engine sounds like a diesel under 2000Ks &#150 so don&#146t be put off if you drive a demonstrator with low K&#146s. Once run in properly (and do run it in properly) it purrs like a kitten, and revs smoothly until it get above 4000 revs. (then it&#146s a bit harsh)

Off road, it really cannot be beaten &#150 with rear lockers as standard (just slip it in 4 low) this vehicle is one that will go just about anywhere. 85% of maximum torque, and it has almost 300nm (that&#146s a lot), is available at idle. Try it &#150 go to the steepest hill you can find, put it in first gear, and take your feet off the pedals &#150 the thing will just drive up the hill without stalling. It&#146s weird to do it the first time.

Overall &#150 if you like the look of the Jeep &#150 you will love to own it &#150 live with the small boot, sell you children, and spend many happy hours on or off road.
