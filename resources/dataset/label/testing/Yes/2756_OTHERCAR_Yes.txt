            I am very happy to give the VW Jetta a positive review.  My black 1997 Jetta GT is my pride and joy; I absolutely love the vehicle.  It may not be the biggest or most feature-laden car available for the price (then and now), but it makes up for it with fine German engineering, handling, and spunk.

The car is an absolute joy to drive, more fun than any other car I&#146ve had the privilege to get behind the wheel of. It is quick off the line (especially equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, as mine is) and feels well connected to the road at all times.  And with just under 50,000 miles on it, the car still behaves as if it were brand new.

The exterior design of the older models (through 1998) was wonderful, if a little boxy. Even so, the classic design of the older models made the cars unique in a world of oval and angular designs from the major manufacturers. The short nose makes the car easy to drive and even easier to park (i.e., it is very easy to tell where the front of the car stops).  The rear end of the car is rather high, which in some ways limits vision out of the rear window, but in exchange provides for an extremely spacious trunk.

Inside, I find the Jetta to be stylishly laid out with ergonomics in mind. Every vital control is within reach of the driver, and the radio and climate controls are slightly angled toward the driver&#146s seat for easy access. All controls on the dashboard are clearly marked and are easy to find.  Central power locking is located in the center console (not in the doors) for easy access by both driver and passengers. The dashboard gauges are black-on-white (black numbers, white background), which makes them extremely easy to see.  At night, the dashboard area of the car is very well lit. The gauges glow a soft green, as do the LCD displays for the odometer and clock (embedded below the speedometer and tachometer).

The seats of the Jetta are firm and supportive, yet not too hard. They are perfect for short trips to the convenience store or long trips on the interstate. (My dad knows this all too well; he put most of those 50,000 miles on the car!) The front seats move forward and back via a lever underneath the front of the seats and also recline using a dial located on the side of the seat. Turning the crank isn&#146t quite as quick as using the lever found in most cars, but is great for perfectly positioning the seat for long drives.

The rear seats are comfortable as well, with shoulder harnesses for both passengers (the little &#147hump&#148 on which a fifth passenger is supposed to sit is served only by a lap belt).  Perhaps the best feature in this area of the car is the flip down seat that provides a pass-through to the trunk. For transporting larger items, the seat cushions slide down and the seat back flips down to create an almost-flat surface for just about anything.

As far as other amenities go, the Jetta is well above par as far as I&#146m concerned. The radio is wonderful, and has done everything I asked it to do over the past two and a half years. It came with &#147VW Premium Sound&#148 plus a cassette player. One feature that I would like to have is a CD changer, which is a dealer-installed option (about $200 for a 6-disc changer; controls are built into the existing radio for a VW changer, so no goofy remote control). Also, I have come to call the heater in the Jetta the &#147atomic heater,&#148 because it warms up so quickly and is extremely warm. Usually I end up setting the temperature dial halfway between &#147cold&#148 and &#147hot&#148 just to keep room temperature in the car.

Suspension and handling (which I mentioned earlier as fine German engineering) is superb. The car literally &#147sticks&#148 to the road like an upscale sports sedan, without the upscale price. Cornering is near perfect, and the turning radius is something I have recently discovered and am very happy with (being able to make U-turns in the tightest of spots is sometimes a big advantage).

I only have a few negative comments about the Jetta, and because I want to be fair, I will share them with you as well.  We haven&#146t had any major problems with the car.  So far we have gotten four new tires (the old ones were worn out from the mileage), a new windshield (cracked, also from the miles), and a new trunk release mechanism (the trunk was locked shut and unable to be opened for a week until it was fixed). Other minor wear and tear items include a broken fog lamp cover and a finicky driver-side door lock (which also controls the cars security system).

Overall, I am very happy with my Jetta, and I would only trade it in for another VW. Interested buyers beware: Volkswagens, as their ads say, really are &#147drivers&#146&#148 cars. If you don&#146t love to drive, and a car is just a machine to get you from point A to point B, chances are a VW is not for you. However, if you are a passionate driver who looks for qualities in a car besides lowest price and most features (and are unwilling to move up to an Audi, BMW, Lexus, etc.), than I strongly encourage you to look at Jettas and other Volkswagens. You won&#146t be disappointed.

On a final note, if there are any aspects of the Jetta you feel I&#146ve missed in this review, please let me know by responding through the epinions.com website. I would love to hear your comments, and am willing to edit or add to this review depending on your comments.
