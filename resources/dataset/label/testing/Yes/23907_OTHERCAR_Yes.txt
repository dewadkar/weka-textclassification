            Just a few years ago, automotive enthusiasts were complaining about the impending doom of the sports car. Surrounded by increasing numbers of sport-utility vehicles, the future looked bleak.
The arrival of the BMW Z3, Mercedes-Benz SLK, and the Porsche Boxster have changed things dramatically.
Now, it is Audi's turn to show that there may still be something new in the automotive world. 
Like Volkswagen's New Beetle, the TT is a production car that began life as an auto show concept car. And, like the Beetle, it drew on a legendary past to portray an exciting future. 
The TT shares its underpinnings with Volkswagen's new Golf, Jetta, and Beetle, plus several cars we don't see in the U.S. market: the Audi A3, Skoda Oktavia, and SEAT Toledo. Each of these cars competes in its own well-defined niche, and each has its own character. I suspect that part of the VW-Audi expertise in character-building from a single platform lies in the elasticity of the platform itself. For example, at 95.4 inches, the TT's wheelbase is 3.4 inches shorter than the Beetle's, and the car is 2.0 inches shorter overall.
Inside, Art Deco numerals on classic analog instruments reinforce the TT's 1930s heritage, when the 16-cylinder rear-engined Auto Union Grand Prix cars were adding fresh chapters to the book of racing legends. 
Overall, the TT reminds me of the Honda Prelude, which is about as good as it gets in sporty front-drive cars. This applies to acceleration, as well as handling. With 180-horsepower from VW's 1.8-liter 20-valve four-cylinder-turbocharged, the TT can scoot to 60 mph in less than 7 seconds.
That's with the standard five-speed manual transmission. An automatic would slow things down.
Money-wise, the TT pricing starts at $31,025, some $5000 more than a Prelude SH, which offers almost identical performance and a lot more interior space, in a less attractive package. And it's considerably less expensive-about $6000 less-than BMW's Z3 2.8 Coupe, a very good performer that offers only two seats.
Besides being entertaining to drive, the TT is almost impossible to top for high-profile visibility. To get the same kind of reaction from people, you'd have to spend a quarter-million bucks for some sort of Italian exotic.
Even then, this little Audi would hold its own.
