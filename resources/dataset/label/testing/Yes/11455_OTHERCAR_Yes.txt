            I have purchased a 1995 Mercury Sable that was approx. 2 years old when I bought it and it has been a great family car wit on one exception. The car has a 3.0 Liter V-6 engine and has all options available to my knowledge. We have put approx. 40,000 miles on the car to this point and it has been extremely reliable auto with the only exception being we have had trouble with the speedometer, we have had the same problem with it several times and the dealer says they will not warranty it because it was over 12 months or 12000 miles. But other than that i would recommend this auto for anyone.  <br><br>
