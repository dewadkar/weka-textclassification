                 The Hummer can go over any terrain.  It can go up rocky hills, it can go over gaps in the earth, it can submerge in water with a special item that is like a snorkeler.  Even though it has a very slow acceleration speed it is okay because who wants to race in a Hummer when you can go beat other vehicle off road and I mean true off road, not dirt and dirt piles for trucks to go off road racing on.  
     It has a lot of power, to pull, to haul, and to push.  It has a lot of features that include:  inflatable/deflatable tires, cd player, am/fm radio, cassette player, standard/automatic, hardtop/convertible/humpback, etc.. 
     A Hummer is the best way to go if you like doing outdoor recreation events, riding through town to get sharp because people really aren't used to seeing a Hummer cruising around, and also it is the best utility vehicle again because no other utility vehicle can go through what a hummer can go through.  No other vehicle can go through or withstand damage that it can.
