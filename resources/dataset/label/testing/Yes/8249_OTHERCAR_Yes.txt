            This has been a much-reviewed camera (I read almost all of them before buying), so I'll keep it brief. Everything that you about what is wrong with this camera is pretty much correct. 
The dark LCD/EVF (electronic viewfinder, like a camcorder) problem is VERY troubling. In a dimly-lit room, both viewfinders are utterly useless. Point your camera in the direction of your subject and hope for the best. I figured I wasn't wasting any film, so just "bracket" a couple of pictures, then delete the ones you don't want. That's kind of the point of digital, right?
The auto-focus lag is pretty long. I have a 4-month-old son whose smiles are fleeting. I have to be pretty quick on the trigger to catch them. Riding the auto-focus seems to be the way to go, though it has to drain the batteries.
Speaking of batteries, I haven't had too much trouble with battery usage. I upgraded from a Sony that ate alkalines for breakfast (two at a time), so being able to fill up a 64MB card or two on one set of AAs is like Nirvana for me.
I test-drove the 2800 at WalMart and was concerned that it didn't seem very sturdy. Putting 4 AAs in it made all the difference, though. It feels great in your hand and is very comfortable and natural to hold.
The bundled software is horrendous. Grab the drivers from the CD and put it away.
I also bought the 2800 to perform as a PC cam, which is one of the initial reasons I pursued a Fuji. As a PC Camera, the 2800 gets a D-. Images are dark and discolored and there are NO camera controls. Oh well...

On the up-side, the image quality of all 6 settings (3 levels of 2 mega-pixels, 2 of 1 mega-pixels, and VGA) is excellent for a camera in this price-range.
I don't know about you, but the fewer variables, the better. I have never used the Sepia-tone, Black and White, mirrored, solarize or any special effects on previous digitals or my camcorder. That's what PhotoShop is for.
The menus are easy to navigate, though there is a different menu of setup options under each function (Movie, Playback and Picture), and I have a tendency to forget what is where.
The flash recycle time is amazing, especially compared to my last camera (see battery-hog above).
The movie with sound mode is great. A well-lit room (or outdoors) is required for good quality video. I've found it very useful. My only beef? If I push any button on the camera while recording, it comes through LOUD and clear on the mic ("THUNK!").
I haven't used the voice memo feature, and perhaps never will.
All in all, I am very happy with the Fuji 2800. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.
