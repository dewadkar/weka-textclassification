            I was fed up with American cars and all their mechanical problems.  My last two new cars were from General Motors and they both suffered from rear axle problems--and lots of other problems, due to poor design and sloppy workmanship.  I wanted a reliable car and since I drove a lot, I wanted great gas mileage.  I had worked with a computer programmer who bought and repaired old cars and re-sold them for a profit, in his spare time.  He accidentally discovered that most old Hondas had nothing really wrong with them.  Soon, he had specialized in Hondas--to the exclusion of all other vehicles.

This man told me many times that Hondas were built consistently better than any other car.  I later learned that while American car makers ignore the problems discovered in each model year (because it will cost money to fix these problems), Honda Motors actually looks for problems and makes all kinds of improvements, constantly.  

Anyway, I also researched &quot;Consumer's Reports Magazine.&quot; They reported that the 4-cylinder, 5-speed Honda Accord for 1990 was actually faster than the Camry V6--and it got better gas mileage!  I put 175,000 miles on mine, then gave it to my son.  He now has 255,000 and the A/C has never needed service!  The original muffler last 200,000 miles, the alternator 237,000!  

At 110,000 miles the car died with an ignition problem.  The Honda dealer fixed it for $150.00.  Three months later I got a letter from Honda informing me that some of their ignitions were not up to Honda standards and if I'd had any work done on mine, I should bring in the receipt for a full refund.  I did, and promptly got a check from Honda for the $150.00.  The letter went on to say I should bring the car in and they would install a new distributor--also for free!  I routinely got over 400 miles to a tank of gas.  The car handles very well, it started in all the cold Wisconsin winters and after 11 years still has very little rust.  The Honda Accord has been among the top ten cars in �Car and Driver� magazine for over ten years.

I keep buying new ones and encouraging friends to do the same!  Everyone I know who buys a Honda (or, their luxury line, the Acura) reports similar great service from these high quality cars.  The US government just picked the Honda Accord as the best performer in their roll-over statistics (least likely to roll-over and fewest deaths when it does).  Unlike top-heavy Sport-Ute�s, the Honda Accord is low to the ground, corners very well and provides great �road feel.�
