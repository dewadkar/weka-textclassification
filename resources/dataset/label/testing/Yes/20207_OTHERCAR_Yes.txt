            You bet!  I was always a die hard Chrysler fan.  My car to be turned in was a 1984, yes 84, Chrysler New Yorker that you can see had obviously served me well.  

I began my search there, almost bought a 1998 Concorde, until I went back to put down a deposit and saw mucho damage had been done to the car over the weekend.  Check engine light persistently came on and stayed on, the molding around the headlights was hanging by a thread, the passenger side front bumper was no longer in alignment, and the driver's side mirror was cracked.  This was damage I could see and lead me to question what I couldn't.  The deal fell through and I ran not walked from the lot.

The very next day I saw a large ad for 1999 Chevy Malibu's with low mileage.  My husband had driven a big V8 Malibu in college and hadn't had too many problems, so off we went to look.

Drove a new model and really liked it, but the advice of many about the immediate depreciation of a new car upon leaving the lot weighed on my mind.  Besides it was blue, yeah I know that shouldn't matter, but my last 2 cars driven for a total of 19 years were blue and I needed a change.

My heart stopped when I saw a green one.  The interior was gray and cloth both of which I liked.  The girl's bemoaned the fact that it did not have a "cool" spoiler, but I really didn't care.  The odometer read 25,999 miles, not too many.  I took her out for a test drive with the salesman, and it was love at first turn.  This powerful V6 3.1L beast could surely move (remember I was well used to a 4 cylinder.)  The salesman advised me to slow down a bit as we were in a heavily police monitored section.

The handling was exquisite and responded quickly to whatever I threw at it.  The seats were extremely comfortable, and this is very unusual for I am a bit on the short side 5'4" and usually have trouble seeing over the seat head rests, but had no real problems here.  The steering wheel was able to tilt another plus as I like to drive with it up and my husband down.

My girls thought the best parts though were that it had front and rear cup holders, and in addition to am/fm radio had both cassette and a CD player.  The sound quality was awesome!  They also liked the large trunk that the 12 year old could almost lie flat crossways in and that her 10 year old sister by her side could.

The brakes being ABS took a little getting used to because the pulsing sensation you feel upon slowing was similar to my old cars brakes when they needed replacing.  Wasn't sure how I felt about the dual air bags, but knew they would at least lower my insurance costs a bit.

With the addition of that "cool" spoiler added and a set of new tires thrown in we bought the car for $12,300+ tax, title and fees.  Best of all was that the original manufacturer's warranty will not expire until Feb. 23 of next year so I would have longer coverage than just the lemon protection of 36 months.

We also for $1557+ tax purchased the "bumper to bumper" diamond plan extended warranty coverage which is good 7 years from the day I purchased the warranty or 70,000 total miles which ever comes first.  AAA membership is included, plus a rental (not loaner) car each time mine is out of service and lodging/food expenses of up to $225 if the car conks out and I am more than 100 miles from home.

I think we got a great deal, and I absolutely love this car!
