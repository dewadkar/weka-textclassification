            I loved my Honda CRX because it was a great first car. It wasn't to big and scary for a new driver but it eventually became too small. My car ran smoothly even though I had over 220,000 kms on it. With regular oil changes and tune ups I was able to keep the engine in pristine condition with no repairs besides a clutch in the three years I owned this car. The price of course was right for a person not looking to spend to much on a car but still get a nice looking sporty car. Eventually however I found that just having two seats could be very annoying if I was trying to help transport friends without cars or carpool to school. I eventually ended up giving up my CRX for a Honda Prelude but would definately reccomend it to someone who doesn't typically have more then one passenger or has a second car.
