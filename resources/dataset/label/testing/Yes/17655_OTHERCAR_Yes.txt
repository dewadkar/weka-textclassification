            The 850 GLT (1996) is a great car. It is fun to drive (it has power when you need it) and has very good handling (corners well) - at the same time you can drive it in a relaxed way - the car does not push itself on you. Visibility is very good front and back. The best part � the seats! Real support for real people. Go with leather.

The car has airbags (4) and antilock brakes (they work) and it is very responsive � useful when you drive in traffic with a cell phone�

The trunk is large and the sound system is very good (but cost a lot to replace). The car is also very dependable, my car is 4 years old and I had no problem so far.

The one thing I would change is the location of the buttons for the windows and the control for the side view mirrors � move from center to door (Volvo did fix it later).
