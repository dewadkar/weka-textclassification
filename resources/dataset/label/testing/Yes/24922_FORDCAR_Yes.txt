            The Ford Mustang is one of the best looking sports cars out there for its price range.  When you compare it to the camaro, cougar, celica, and firebird, the mustang seems to have a more appealing look.  The interior design of the mustang feels like a cockpit and seems to form to your body perfectly.  Punching the gas and taking corners is where the mustang really starts to get good though.  Not only are you having a great time driving, but you look good doing it.  The mustang is also one of the safer sports cars on the road today.  Along with the many safety features, the mustang is proven to be a very reliable car.  Just try to limit the driving in the winter.  The downsides to the mustang though are fuel economy(for the V8s) and that the overall performance doesn't quite match the competitors.  The small difference in performance the mustang has to the camaro and firebird are not noticeable to the average driver.  The looks, however, are very noticeable, and the Mustang has the advantage there.  So if you are looking for a fun, sporty car for a decent price, look no further than the mustang.<br><br>
