            The Camry is an excellent car to purchase for anyone. Single, married, young or old. My family owns two of them and consider them extremely reliable. The Camry has plenty of room, making distant trips comfortable for the whole family. I find that the gas mileage is very competitive, receiving approx. 34 miles to the gallon. I have never had a serious problem with my cars and consider them to be very safe when traveling with my young child.  The car also handles very well. It is easy to drive and very comfortable, and although we never noticed it until my neighbor mentioned it, the Camry is very quiet. I would highly recommend this vehicle to ANYONE who is interested in buying a new or used vehicle.<br><br>
