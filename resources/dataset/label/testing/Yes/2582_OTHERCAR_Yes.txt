            I bought the Grand Voyager LE in 1995 because I've got two really big greyhounds.  They like to &quot;GO&quot; in the car, and I used to live in the middle of the city in a condo.  If I didn't take the dogs with me regularly to the park, they never got to run.  The Voyager is big enough for each dog to have a bench seat to herself and also for them to lie down on the floor between seats.  

So far, knock on wood, my Voyager has been trouble free.  I did change the tires at 30k and get new front brake pads at 18k, but other than that it's been fine.  Oh, in the first year I had a couple of problems with the battery but that seems to have settled down after two replacement batteries under warranty.

I got one with a 3.8 L engine (it was actually a 96 model engine in a 95 car) and big as it is the darned thing really has a lot of pickup.  I got extra heavy duty suspension and the tow package, and handling is really not bad for such a big bus.

After living in the city for 3 years with the van and the dogs I bought a house in the suburbs.  Vans and suburban home ownership really go together.  In the months since I've moved I've carried rolls of carpet, an outdoor grill, window shutters, roofing material for a storage shed, a large air conditioner, and many other items that I swore would require a truck or at least removal of the rear seat.  In every case all I had to do at most was pop the rear seat down.  It's amazing what can be carried in one of these vehicles.

Gas mileage isn't bad either.  I get about 19 miles to the gallon which is pretty good for  a heavy truck.

I do feel silly driving around in something so large, but you can't beat the utility of the van.  There's no other car that would make my dogs as happy.<br><br>
