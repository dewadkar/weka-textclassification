            (please note, this review includes a bit of history about Chrysler products. Should you not be interested in that part of my review, scroll down to the subheading: "The short of my review is as follows.")
As little as 6 years ago, if you were to look at Chrysler's model lineup, you'd see stale looking boxy automobiles that offered sloppy handling, slow engines, and generally were only embraced by those who were not much into driving. The same was true for Dodge, and the now discontinued Plymouth.

Then, the impossible happened. Chrysler turned around its entire line of automobiles to attract younger buyers who actually care how their car looks and performs.

Today, Chrysler is manufacturing automobiles that look very stylish, offer good performance, and their reliability is constantly improving. In fact, in the most recent issue of Consumer Reports, more new Dodge (a brand of Chrysler...or should I say DaimlerChrysler) automobiles are being recommended than ever before. 

I was never very impressed with the original Dodge Intrepid that debuted in 1994. It looked liberal for its time, however that design just never grew on me. Apparently, that car had spotty reliability records, however I rode in a Taxi in San Francisco that utilized a 1995 Dodge Intrepid with over 300,000 miles, and it seemed to run quite well.

Fast forward to 1998, and the new Dodge Intrepid is introduced. It was definately a striking automobile. It had very good looks, and boasted an excellent ride with many features. This car lives up to just about all its expectations.

**The short of my review is as follows:
The Dodge Intrepid is a fine looking automobile with a sporty ride, well designed interior, and a good price.

The long of my review is as follows:

THE DRIVE:
There is no doubt that the Dodge Intrepid is a large automobile. It is over 200 inches long, and weighs well over 3000 lbs. However, it does not behave like a large car at all. In fact, the car handles very nimbly for a car of its size. It takes corners with little lean, however the ride is slightly harsh for daily driving. I personally would rather have a slightly harsh ride if it allows the car to handle well, as is the case with Intrepid. This car also has an available AutoStick transmission which allows you to control when the car changes gears, a fun feature that really has no drawbacks. This car's shortcoming comes in acceleration. Even with the 3.2 liter V6 engine that boasts 225 horsepower, (this engine comes on the ES model, the one I drove) the car seems to struggle to gain speed quickly. The 0-60 time is in the nines, which is disappointing for a car with this much horsepower. However, the cabin remains quiet, and the car's chassis is quite rigid, so overall, the car is a pleasure to drive.

INTERIOR:
The seats are well designed. The model I tested came with all possible interior options. It had an electronic climate control, in dash tape/cd player with an in-trunk 6-disk changer, overhead trip computer, leather seats, power windows/doorlocks/mirrors, sunroof, ABS brakes, traction control, and the auto-stick transmission. The seats are firm, yet have enough padding to be comfortable, and offer excellent all-around support. All controls are within easy reach of the driver, and the materials used appear to be high quality. The interior is overall both functional and aesthetically pleasing. 
The stereo system offers very good sound quality with excellent bass and treble response.

RELIABILITY:
It looks as though Chrysler has finally gotten their act together in the reliability department. I've heard few reliability complaints about the new Intrepid, and it is recommended by Consumer Reports.
