            We were on the market for a digital camera for quite some time!  We wanted the best value for the money, and also something easy to use.    We ended up buying the Olympus D460 Zoom.  While it isn't always the easiest to use, we are happy with our purchase!  The pictures we have taken with our camera are great!  But we definitely have a love/hate relationship!  I have found that the menus are not user friendly at all.  I usually have to have the user guide (which needs it's own user's guide) with me when I use the menus (which isn't always convenient). If you change something without knowing it, you never know what you might end up with.  When you consider buying the camera, make sure you get rechargeable batteries, because disposables do not last more than an hour or two.  We ended up buying a rechargeable battery pack!<br><br>
