            What needs to be said about this awsome car? With its very unique styling, vast amounts of power, and beutiful interior, this car makes a very positive statement.  My 1999 300m has racked up miles very quikly, and has had very few problems, less the rear window motors, a problem easily fixed under warranty at your car dealer.  the handling of this car makes you feel like you are driving a very capable sports car. The engine lets you pass with confidence and ease at any speed, and the very fun autostick transmision is very easy to use. The infinity stero is a very capable stereo, and the seats are comfy enough to drive all day.
with few options and it base price of under $30,000, this car is also a unbelievable bargain.  this car is capable of taking on the Lexus es300, Acura TL, and the Audi A6. The only bad thing about this car I have found is the rear visibility. The trunk lid sits very high, and you can not really see the back of your car, so parallel parking is kinda difficult. Last the suspension is soft enough when driving so you hardly feel bumps in the road, yet firm enough for unbelivable control. And who can go with out noticing the beutiful dash and green backlight display.<br><br>
