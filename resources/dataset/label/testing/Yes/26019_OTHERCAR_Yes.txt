            This is by far my favorite car. What it lacks up for in speed performance and extra styling, it makes up for in so many other ways.

I have had my cavalier for over a year now and I absolutely adore it. I have yet to find another car in its price range like the Cavalier. I looked at several different vehicles and dealerships before I decided on this car. I wanted something a bit flashier, however, in hindsight I am glad that this is the one I bought.

Passengers in my car have commented on the lack of leg room, which doesnt bother me at all because I am only 5'4&quot;. My boyfriend is 6'1&quot; and although he does get as much space as he wants, it is sufficiently comfortable for him. 

The backseats are wide enough for my sons carseat and the car also has 3 safety hooks to latch the childseat to, which provides great stability. The trunk space is large as well. The road noise isnt all that bad, either.

It handles well around corners and after driving a metro and a minivan, that is a great plus for me. The acceleration is not what you would find in a sportscar or the such, but remember this is not a sportscar. Gas mileage is decent and so far the only time my car has gone into the shop is for routine maintenance. I hope to have this car around for a long time, and the track record for the Cavalier is very good, although opinions on the car are widely varied. I would suggest test driving one before settling on anything else. <br><br>
