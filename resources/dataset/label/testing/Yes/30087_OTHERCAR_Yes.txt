            After doing what seemed like endless research I finally choose the very safe Kodak DC280Z. Even though every ranking I saw had vastly different cameras at the top of each list, this camera was consistently near the top and was usually between 30%-60% less in price than comparable products. 

After using it for a couple of months now (it is 9/00) I have found it to be exactly what the reviews said it would be: durable, very easy to use, and with high image quality (especially outdoors). The only problems I have had with it are the 2x zoom is a little lacking, its on the big and heavy side, and you have to use rechargeable batteries to get any sort of long lasting power. 

This camera is the best value on the market now because to upgrade in any area (size, zoom, image quality a little) would greatly increase your cost. The high end Nikon Coolpix cameras seem to have SLIGHTLY better image quality (especially indoors) but are larger and much more expensive. And don't underestimate the value of the USB connection. For the largest sized pictures it only takes about 3 seconds to download them. I've seen other cameras take a minute to download the same size pictures. That's a big deal when you start talking about battery power.<br><br>
