            I'm a professional mechanic and car enthusiast, unfortunately cars become like appliances when you deal with them everyday.So when I decided I needed a new car 
finding something in my price range that would keep my interest was tough.I was looking for a four door reliable
well appointed car.
In my opinion Toyota , Honda and Nissan build high quality
cars that are either overstyled (like some current model Nissan's) or are very vanilla. I did not consider the Grand Am at first because I did not trust the "big three" for build quality and reliability.I rented a car for a weekend
trip and when they showed up with my rental it was a Grand Am SE V6. I drove over a thousand miles in one weekend in that car and it won me over.The V6 is a descendant of the 3.1L that was a modified 2.8L . I trusted this engine for long term reliability based on previous experiences (my dad put over 230,000 miles on a Z24 with a 2.8L)
Also the 3.4L in the Grand Am GT is a pushrod driven valvetrain engine ( no timing belt ) . If you've ever had one break you'll know what I'm talking about.
These cars can be had for a song used due to the high numbers of them that were leased or sold new.
When I started shopping for an SE model I quickly discovered the price difference easily justified stepping up to the GT model. I've put several thousand miles on mine so far and I'm very happy with it .
The best advice I can give to someone shopping for a used car is to consider what you are buying five years from now.
Will it be an economy model that you settled for ?
The latest bodystyle Grand Am GT is an exceptional buy I feel.I could not find another car with so many options , this new , in this price range ($10,000 to $15,000)
The model I purchased is an '01 GT V6 with leather .
Lastly , being a mechanic I know there is an issue with 
oil and coolant intermix . This dates back into the early
1980's with the 2.8L engine .All I can say about that is
I work on cars for a living and they all break no matter 
who builds them.
