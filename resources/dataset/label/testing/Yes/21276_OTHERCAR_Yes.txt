            My '92 Toyota Camry is the love of my life.  I don't even think about trading cars as this one is still driving well.  It handles well in the mountains and on flat lands.  With a family of four there is enough room for all to ride comfortably.  The truck is large enough to carry all the gear and extras that a family needs on a vacation or just a day trip.  Last year I rear-ended a Ford Expedition at 40 MPH.  There was close to $2000 damage to the Ford Expedition and just a few scratches on the front of the Camry's bumper.  The Camry took the lick without hurting my daughter or me.  I have owned 9 other vehicles in my life, but now I know there is no other car, but the Camry for safety and reliability.<br><br>
