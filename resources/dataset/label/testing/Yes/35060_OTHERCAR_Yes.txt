            I recently purchased the Landrover Discover SII. I took the Rover for a off road testdrive and loved the way the vehicle rumbled through the mud and climbed over the hills.  The Rover has the class of it's own. It looks great from any side of the road (ignore those people who says it's a box).  It has a killer sound system with 320 watts and it takes the corners with ease better than some of the highly priced cars.  The seats are comfortable with tilting armrest and three types of adjustments.  The rear seats are auditorium type gives a better view to the passengers. The cargo room is sufficient enough for a stroller and big suitcase and some small items.  Handles great comfortable and puts you above everyone on the road including other SUV's. Although I do not plan to take it off road regularly I enjoy my daily ride to work. The front and rear sunroof and the additional train roof windows give you all the view you want to the outside (I wish the sunroofs slides a bit more).  Highly recommends.<br><br>
