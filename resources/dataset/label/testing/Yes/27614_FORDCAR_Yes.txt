            This is simply the best car I've owned!  Ford really thought things out and put a ton of &quot;smart&quot; features in this car:  the easiest 60/40 seats in the industry (they drop out of sight when you need to open up the space in the back), &quot;hand grooves&quot; in the top of the lift gate that allow for easy closing, clothes hooks that face out towards the doors.  These are just some of the many details added.
I have two boys and we easily fit my wife, I, the boys, and three days of luggage (to include gold clubs) in the compartment as we spent three days in Monterey for Christmas.  The gas mileage was excellent!
It's a mini SUV that handles like a car, incredibly tight steering radius, very quick 3.0 liter V6 engine.
I'm not one for those big gas guzzlers that come with their own zip code - the Escape fits the bill (and fits in the garage!)  We're thinking of buying another for my wife.  We bought ours for $23,000 out the door and it was fairly loaded.  This is a MUST buy!<br><br>
