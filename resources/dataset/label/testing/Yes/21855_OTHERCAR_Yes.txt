            I don't spend money on a lot of nice things for myself, but I love to always have a brand new car.  I think I have had 6 brand new cars in the past 10 years!  I know, I know, it sounds crazy.  But hey, it makes me happy!  Not only have I bought 6 new cars in the past 10 years, but 5 of them have been Subarus so I feel I could say I am quite the expert on these cars.

I have had a Legacy Station Wagon L, Impreza Sedan, Legacy Sedan, Legacy Station Wagon (again), and finally the love of my life, (besides my husband and son) my new 2000 Outback in the pretty Wintergreen color!  I LOVE THIS CAR!

My 2000 Outback came with the works:  the winter package (heated rear-view windows, windshield wipers and seats) and an awesome 6 player CD changer (that loads right into the dashboard!)  It is such a smooth drive with the AWD and feels totally solid.  I can't get over how well it handles.  I live in Colorado and know I will love this once winter comes.  I think one of the best qualities of the Subaru station wagons is how equally weighted they are front to back.  You feel like you are driving a tank!

My reason for getting rid of my Jeep (car#5!) was that there was NO room in the back for a normal sized adult to get in and have leg room without smashing his/her legs into the seats in front.  Also, I hated how hard it was to get my son in and out of his carseat!  There was simply not enough room.  Now, my new Outback has plenty of room!  An adult can sit in the back seat comfortably, without his/her legs being cramped.  I can even fit 2 carseats and one other person back there.  The other thing I love is how huge the trunk space is!  I bought the cargo tray accessory and voila!  I have little compartments in which to place my groceries without them rolling all over the place.  Also, for anyone interested, Yakima has finally made a cool ferring that goes with the Subaru roof racks!  It was only $32.00.

Finally, the best thing about the 2000 Outbacks is that the genius who designed the dashboard finally got enough complaints to move over the cup holders!!! YIPPEY! Can you believe it?  Now, there is one in between the two front seats by the shifter, and the other one pops out on the SIDE of the radio and does not get in the way!  This is so much more convenient than how it used to pop out in front of all of the controls and the radio so you had to push it back in to turn to reach anything!  The only thing I don't like, is that there is no mirror for the passenger on the visor.  I guess the Japanese did a study that showed 80% of the time people were by themselves in their cars so they put a mirror on the driver's side. Ummmm helloooooo! How safe is that?  

Anyway, out of anything that could be a con with this car that is about all I can think about.  Go get an Outback today!!!  You won't regret it!<br><br>
