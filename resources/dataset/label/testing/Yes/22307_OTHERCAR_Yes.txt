            i purchased a minivan due to the new little addition to my family - i was reluctant to go from my SUV to the &quot;dreaded minivan&quot;. however, once i saw the practicality and versatility of this vehicle i had to have it. I am so excited with my 2000 MPV - it rides so much better than my SUV. It rides like a car and the SUV rides like a truck. My favorite feature is the 10 cup holders and some even hold liter size drinks. Another wonderful feature is the second row seats slide sideways to convert from a captain seat to bucket seat. The cup holders for the front are located out of the way of the air vents and instrument panel which is very important to me. For families with kids in sports the third seat flips backward and you can sit there and watch the kids - no need to bring chairs anymore. The sapphire blue gets a lot of second looks too. Our model is the ES with leather, sunroof, 6 changer in dash cd. The sunroof seems a little noisy but i love it. The air vents for the 2nd and 3rd row seats are definitely a nice feature. The V6 engine has good pickup. At this time i can't think of anything bad to say about it and would recommend it to anyone - with or without children.TanyaP <br><br>
