            This camera is a great deal!  I bought it 2 months ago at good guys.  I paid around $240 for it.  I think that this is the best deal that you can get for the price.  The camera has many features on it and it it is very simple to use.  I take it snowboarding with me and my friends can even figure out how to use it.  And they are pretty dumb when it comes to electric stuff.  The camera is also very durable.  I can toss it into my backpack and take it anywhere.  I mostly take it to the slopes where I capture many great photos of me and my friends snowboarding.  We then take it home and edit ourselves.  The quality is also great.  It is not fantastic like the expensive ones but it certainly fits it's price range.

  This puppy is so strong and durable.  I have dropped my into the snow before and it didn't even give it a scratch.  It is not waterproof and bullet proof, but can it can handle a good shake.
  When I bought this sucker it came with instructions, extra batteries, leather case and strap.  It was great.  There were no problems getting familiar with the equipment and I had many great pics that I was editing on my computer in the first hour.  It is also very easy to install.  It took my less than one half of an hour.  

   I also went ahead and bought a extra chip for it that cost around50 bucks your electronics store.  This was a very good investment because now I can go to the mountains, take 20 pictures and then pop in the new card and have another new 20 pictures to take.  You can also view and delete pictures right there and then.  This way you can take a pic, look at, and then see if you want to keep it or not.  If you like it keep it and snap on, or if you don't like it delete it, and then snap on and you still have the same amount of pictures left

  I really think that this was a great buy.  I am recommending this to everyone in the market for a digital camera.  I would recommend this camera to all beginners.  Ths is a great start to the world of electronics. <br><br>
