            As an advanced amateur photographer weaned on 35mm and medium format film cameras, I've been waiting for consumer digital cameras to reach parity with film at 8x10 print sizes. The Olympus C-2500L, with a true 2.5 megapixel CCD imager, comes very close and I have the prints to prove it. Before buying the Olympus, I reviewed other digicams with comparable resolution and found most of them lacking in &quot;pro-sumer&quot; features that you should expect in a high-end camera. 

First, the C-2500L is one of the few SLR (Single Lens Reflex) consumer grade digital cameras available, an absolute must if you want to do more than just take snapshots. The downside is you can't preview the image on the LCD before shooting, but this is usually unnecessary since what you see in the viewfinder is what you get (and you extend battery life considerably by not using the LCD). 

The second major feature of this camera is its macro and super-macro capability. I've taken photos of jewelry at less than 2&quot; from the lens that are spectacular, and I don't know of any other current digicam models that can work this close. I also like the ability to use both SmartMedia and CompactFlash cards, a feature unique to this model, and the large buffer memory which allows you to rapidly take up to 5 consecutive photos.

While it's easy enough for a beginner to use in Auto mode, the C-2500L includes many other professional-level features including manual exposure and white balance modes (though the auto white balance consistently delivers good color rendition), TTL flash with optional compensation, etc. If you plan on doing any kind of commercial work, or just want better control of your photos, these features are a must. 

The Olympus C-2500L does have a few flaws, foremost among them the lack of a USB or firewire port. Forget using its serial port to transfer image files to your PC...it takes forever. You'll need a USB memory card reader which I've found works just fine. There is also no image preview on the LCD as I mentioned earlier, but this is a minor gripe. Finally, if you're used to working with a quality 35mm SLR, you'll find the overall construction of the Olympus a bit &quot;plasticy&quot; and lightweight, though some might argue this is an advantage.

Overall, I highly recommend the C-2500L for those wanting an affordable digital camera that delivers excellent results in a very wide variety of picture-taking situations.<br><br>
