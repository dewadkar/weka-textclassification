            Speeding along the Highway of Life, there�s nothing quite as breathtaking as the view from the driver�s seat of a Dodge Stealth.  Of course, it helps that under the hood lies one of the most powerful engines ever built, but, my fast-lane friends, that�s not the point.

There�s something altogether empowering about driving this extinct beauty.  Back in 1993, it was the price tag.  Today, it�s the classic lines.  And somewhere in between, it was the fact that I had all the money in the world and an alpha male ego to boot.

<i>Funny</i>, you say, <i>I thought Shazzle99 was a chick.</i>

Oh don�t be fooled, my fair weathered comrades.  My feminine wile and flowing blonde hair are a mere disguise for an undercover stockbroker, a ruthless real estate mogul, a fierce politician.  I may resemble a simple Stay-at-Home-Mom, struggling to elevate my career as a writer, but beneath this delicious exterior lies the heart of an animal.  A temperamental beauty.  A race car driver.

�Give me cherry red or give me death!� she cries as she peels out of the car dealership.

Oh, those were the days.  But I digress.  After all, we�re talking about <i>you</i>, aren�t we?  You�ve had your eye on that �93 Dodge Stealth for a few years now, haven�t you?  Waiting for the price tag to drop (substantially), you�ve often wondered what it would feel like to hug the road, take a corner, flick a butt from the curved, ergonomic driver�s side window.  Well, now is the time, macho boy.  Depreciation has occurred, and if you wait any longer, this sexy baby will be a classic.

Let�s face it.  There�s a certain <i>persona</i> that embodies the almighty Dodge Stealth owner.  With an intense desire for speed and power, we Stealthy Socialites take great pride in caring for our enviable vehicles.  If you�re questioning the value of a Dodge Stealth� if you�re more than curious about its components and horse power and interior and overall <i>worth</i>� perhaps you�re better suited for a 4-door Sedan.

The 1993 Dodge Stealth doesn�t have a whole lot going for it.  In fact, there are more cons than pros, which doesn�t make this a worthwhile purchase.  Many times, I have shrieked through a red light on a wet, rainy day and cried in disbelief, �This car is a hunk of junk!�  And indeed, it is.

Yet we defend it.

<i>So, in no particular order, I�d prefer to start with the gosh-awful characteristics of this rare beauty:</i>

<b>Rain, Snow or Sleet, We�ll Get There</b>
Er, guess again.  This is the �extra� vehicle you store in the garage for sunny summer days.  Any Stealth owner can attest (and excuse me, I don�t care that you have all-wheel drive), that their car can�t withstand the pressures of precipitation.  Hydroplaning will become a regular word in your everyday vocabulary, and you�ll hold your breath every time you approach a red light on a wet, rainy day.  An experienced Stealth driver will adjust to this downfall, slowing considerably at the first sign of yellow, taking turns like an 82-year-old gramma, opting to stay behind that Mack truck rather than pass it.  While SUVs and Minivans leave them in their dust, they just smile and shake their heads.  �I�ll get there,� they say.  �Eventually.�

<b>Hop In, Dear Friends, I�ve Got Plenty of Room!</b>
While the Stealth may indeed have more room than many comparable sports cars, don�t be fooled into thinking you can motor your friends around town as you hop from bar to bar.  Realistically, the Stealth can fit one driver and one passenger in the front, as well as one small person stretched across the backseat.  The hatch trunk can fit about two regular sized suitcases, and if you fold down the back seat, it can indeed fit one long fishing pole, considering the hook doesn�t poke you in the eye.  Although the owner�s manual claimed I could insert a car seat, I never even tried.  It only takes one look to know this is nearly impossible, and if you were to attempt it, the outcome could be dangerous.

<b>A Ride So Smooth, I Can Feel Every Bump in the Road</b>
While the Stealth does possess a remarkable suspension system and a smooth highway feel, it does ride dangerously close to the ground.  Speed bumps can be pure murder on your underbelly, no matter how slowly you take them.  It is not uncommon to find a used Dodge Stealth that has been severely scratched and dented on the bottom half of its exterior.  This is the price we pay for that steady ride.

<b>Water, Water Everywhere!</b>
Don�t get the wrong idea from that headline.  The Dodge Stealth is a secure, airtight vehicle, and under normal circumstances, you will not find water leakage even during heavy downpours.  With that said, however, the exterior of the hatch back does have a tendency to collect rainwater, and when you open the hatch, you will find yourself taking an unexpected bath.  Once again, the experienced Stealth Driver will overcome this downfall by carefully wiping the hatch with a clean, dry towel before attempting to open it.

<b>Holy Smokes, I Can�t See the Road</b>
In the category of Dangerous Precipitation Factor, the front windshield of the Dodge Stealth has a tendency to �fog up� on damp days.  This long, curved window rests at a very unnatural angle, pushing the point where it is almost parallel with the roof.  Due to this design, the defoggers have to work very hard to clear the windshield.  In my driving heyday, I was known to carry a roll of clean paper towels, which I used to wipe my windshield on a regular basis.  Quite truthfully, this was one of my biggest complaints about this vehicle.

<b>Um, <i>HOW</i> Much Did You Say This Would Cost</b>
Granted you can pick up a �93 Dodge Stealth at a reasonable price these days (that is, if you can find one).  But back in �93, you would have paid full price, which had the capability to eat any man alive.  Currently, no matter the condition, I should hope you�d purchase your Stealth at a cost under ten grand.  The problem, then, is not so much the purchase price as it is the cost of maintenance and insurance.  Considering the Dodge Stealth is no longer manufactured on any assembly line, the parts will cost a pretty penny (not that they were ever cheap).  You will indeed need to maintain this car with more conviction than you do, say, your minivan.  Oil changes, transmission checks, tire pressure� the list really goes on and on� needs to be done, at the very least, every six months.  In addition, insurance still costs an arm and a leg for this monster, which has obvious safety issues (see above).  If you were hoping to pick up a good �ol American sports car to fiddle with in your garage, this might not be the model.

<i>But, alas, Ye Aspiring Stealthy Socialite, this car has its (obviously) redeeming qualities:</i>

<b>If It Were Alive, I�d Marry It</b>
I suppose beauty is all in the eye of the beholder, but it�s hard to deny the sexual appeal of this chic chunk of steel.    With the sophistication of a debutante, the pinnace of a politician, the temper of a cheetah, the brains of a surgeon, and the body of a gymnast, the 1993 Dodge Stealth (regardless of model type) is a diamond in the rough.  You know it as well as I do: This car turns heads.  As it purrs along a crowded city street, it commands attention.  It�s a pure piece of engineered beauty, which beholds the personality of an entrepreneur.  This is the kind of car in which you�ll find yourself sleeping at night, caressing its gentle leather seats and whispering sweet nothings into its 8-speaker stereo system.  If it were alive, I would marry it.  But, alas, I did the next best thing.  I married my car salesman.

<b>Despite All My Ranting and Raving, It�s Big</b>
If I compare this vehicle to other high performance sports cars, the Dodge Stealth is bigger than most competitors.  For the solitary driver, you�ll have plenty of legroom and a driver�s seat designed especially for your enormous ego.  This car embodies a bit more steel than other sports cars, and as a result, it is heavier, sturdier, and maybe even safer.  With a front hood that stretches from here to Zimbabwe, you�ll feel like a Cadillac driver, who happens to own a Stealth.  While it may not be intended for a family guy, it�s perfectly suited for any swinging single, who spends a lot of time alone with his car.  In addition, the back seat provides excellent storage for carry-on materials and your briefcase full of CDs.

<b>Comfortable, Ergonomic Interior</b>
The driver�s seat of the Dodge Stealth is as close to a recliner as you�ll get outside your living room.  It�s cushioned, contoured, sturdy and seductive, and everything (literally <i>everything</i>) is within easy reach.  While most passengers may engage in a bit of complaining, the driver will feel undeniably comfortable and safe behind the wheel.  This car is focused on its owner, providing direct venting, easy touch controls, and plenty of leg room.  This is as loyal as it gets, folks.

<b>Now <i>THIS</i> is a Stereo</b>
With bass dripping from every crack and orifice of this purring vehicle, the standard Dodge Stealth stereo system is top of the line.  There�s no need to upgrade, my friend.  With multiple speakers and a plethora of fancy buttons, you�ll be adjusting your stereo to meet every type of music from rap and hip-hop, to jazz and funk, to pop and rock, to Lawrence Welk.  And through it all, you�ll be loud.  I promise.

<b>And for the Alpha Male in a Chick�s Body, We Have Automatic</b>
If you�re not the type to take great satisfaction in driving that all-powerful stick shift, the Dodge Stealth even comes in Automatic.  Yep, it�s true, folks, even as pathetic as it sounds.  Admittedly, only the Base and E/S models are available with this feature, but if you�re not hell bent on power, it�s at least an option.  These models are indeed difficult to locate, but if you want to drive a sporty car sans stick shift, you�ll find one.

<b>BONUS Advice From Shazzle99</b>
Despite the downfalls, you�re the kind of guy who has his heart set on a Dodge Stealth.  Can�t say as I blame you, my Alpha Male Brother.  This car was placed on our planet for people <i>just like us</i>.  I do have one word of advice, though, for the stubborn Stealthy Socialites among us.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of any car that says �R/T� or �Twin Turbo.�  Quite frankly, you don�t need it.  Buy yourself a nice used �ES,� which may very well save you thousands of dollars and a whole lot of aggravation.  Then, many moons from now, when you�ve had your fill and the romance has ended, sell it and never turn back.  Sooner or later, we all come to our senses.

On the other hand, if you�re the <i>TRUE</i> Alpha Male� if you can compare yourself to the Fat Naked BLEEP with a Million Dollars� forget the Dodge Stealth all together.  Go buy yourself a Viper and call it a day.<br><br>
