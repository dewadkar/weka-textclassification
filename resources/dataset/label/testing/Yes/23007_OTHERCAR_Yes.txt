            After looking for several months trying to find a digital camera that I could afford and understand, I found the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640.
I love it. I no longer have to remember to take film to the store to be developed and waste money on pictures that did not turn out. 
I am by no means a pro at this, so I needed something that was easy to use and understand, which I feel I have in the Polaroid camera. After telling my son and daughter-in-law about it they also purchased one and they love it. 
I have been busy sending pictures to relatives I haven't seen in years and they are amazed at the quality of the pictures. So the camera is also helping me keep in touch with family members. 
I highly recommend this camera to anyone who loves to take pictures and share them with friends and family.<br><br>
