            I have a great friend who nicknames everyone and everything.  As soon as he saw my clean, new Dodge Ram 1500 he nicknamed it: The Mud Hog.  

The Ram looks good, stylish -- but you can also tell at a glance that it is made to perform.  I think the Ram is the best truck on the market, by far.  I own a Suburban too and think it is great, but for a pickup truck I wouldn't consider anything but a Ram.  Bunch of reasons:

1. Performance: 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive, it performs.
2. Looks: I think the Ram has more style.
3. Maintenance &amp; Reliability: It just doesn't break.
4. Room: I'm very tall.  With the power seat, I fit better in the Ram than in any other pickup I've tried.
5. Kids: My kids think the Ram is cool -- and who knows cool better than kids.

Mine is dark green.  I like it...but some days I wish it was red.

If you need or want a pickup truck...get a Dodge Ram.<br><br>
