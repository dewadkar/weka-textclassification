            My wife is car shopping so we've driven a lot of vehicles in the $28-35K (Canadian) range lately- some new, some newish-used/ex-lease. This price range gets us into a pretty competitive bracket - all the cars we tried were V6, most with full load luxury/touring type configurations, including 2002 300M, 2003 Camry, 2003 Jetta GLI V6, as well as some Mercedes products and a '99 BMW 328i. Almost as an afterthought, we took out a silver-gray Sonata, and I was amazed at how refined and pleasing it is to drive. I remember the first Hyundai Ponys- you could almost hear them rusting away. They were cheap and looked it. It seems Hyundai has come a long way, baby. This Sonata, their top-line sedan (for now... the salesman says a new flagship will be arriving on the lot within a couple of months)   is very well appointed, has good body panel fit and finish, and comes with all the toys. It has an adequate, quiet V6, above average handling and an astonishingly smooth and quiet freeway ride- in this respect comparing favorably (gulp) to a low-mileage 2000 Mercedes C230 with a supercharged 4 cylinder engine. It also has one of the better warranties on the market, and the salesman assures me that after-market quality surveys now place Hyundai just behind first place Toyota, and on a par with Honda. Or was it the other way around?... They also have 3 year financing at 0%- sort of like free money... 

The interior front seating has plenty of head, leg and shoulder room for a plus 6-footer like me, fully adjustable heated leather 6 way seats (no memory function) well positioned gauges and controls, although the various knobs for the AM/FM/single disc CD changer were small and less convenient than I would have liked. Audio quality is very good.  Climate controls offer what I would expect in a mid-luxury car, without dual (passenger side) controls. I had no problems with visibility, and back seat headroom is (just barely) sufficient for me. Knee room is good and the bolster length provides adequate thigh support. I wouldn't want to put 3 adults in back, but 2 would sit in comfort. There are backseat headrests and door size is good for entry/exit. Doors close positively with no tinniness. All the body seams and edges are well finished. (no visible welds). Moonroof is standard with this model, as is AC and full power doors/windows and mirrors. 

The engine runs very quietly at idle. This is no screamer sports car, but acceleration is adequate and smooth, and freeway performance more so. This car runs vibration free at speed. Wind noise is minimal. Handling is reasonably tight with minimal body lean. I didn't go on any canyon runs with it, but on a moderately twisty road steering was sure and tight, and there was no oversteer even braking hard into a turn with an unforeseen decreasing radius.  Handling doesn't compare with the 328i, but that is no surprise.  The 4speed automatic transmission has a Triptonic feature that works well through the curves, and it let me squeeze a bit more engine grunt out of the higher RPM range for the few minutes we were on the back road. Braking via 4 discs and ABS gets this medium weight car down to legal and stop with no surprises. A few more horses and mid-range torque married to a standard transmission, along with slightly stiffer suspension would make this sedan into a more inviting sportscar, but would likely impact the smooth ride. It would be a good option for Hyundai to consider. 

Styling is pleasing to the eye but risks being a bit derivative- the headlights are a homage to the Mercedes C series, the grille (one of the few options available on this loaded model is a bright chrome front grille to replace the matte black standard one) is Buick-y, and the tail lights almost evoke a Jag image. Not that any of those are ugly cars, but I wish the Sonata had a distinct style of its own. The car's overall stance and proportions are well balanced, and I think that reflects my feelings about this car overall. 

After driving a number of more expensive marquee name-brand vehicles, I have to say that the Sonata does just about everything better that I would have expected from such a modest price (about $27,300 Canadian as driven). It has a sense of balance and smoothness that belies its price, and it compares well, and in some ways favorably with cars costing much more.  It is extremely well-equipped, and feels well-made. I would be happy if my wife buys one. I would be even happier if she lets me drive it.
