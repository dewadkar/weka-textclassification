                    I acquired my 1990 Toyota Corolla last year when the gas prices started to go up. At the time I got it it only had 77,000 miles and ran great. At 100,000 miles I had to replace the CV axle and buy new tires, it still had the original tires on it. It drove great and handled very well in tight places. I got 24 miles to the gallon and rarely had to take it to the shop other than for oil changes.

   Earlier this month my kids and I were tooling down the road and stopped at and
intersection when the light turned. We were rear ended. We were at a dead stop and a
pick up hit us doing approx. 50 miles per hour. My little Corolla soared through the
intersection. My son and I were in the front seat which collapsed to the back seat
where my 9 year old daughter was sitting. Through screams of terror and pain I managed to safely get the car our of traffic and to a stop. My son was screaming of back pain and got out of the car (against my wishes) to walk it off, my daughter screamed of neck pain. I climbed out of the car and opened the back door to check on her she was ok. 

   This great little car gave its life for us. It was totaled. The good things are all of our
seat belts were on and worked no glass shattered, not even a crack, nothing caved in to cause cuts, the gas tank didn't burst or even leak. 

   We are all sore of course and my biggest injury in a badly bruised knee from hitting
the steering column. But in all we are great and thankful we are alive. I owe it to the
design of this car it crumpled where it was supposed to.
