            On Sunday, I volunteered at a local SCCA Novice school for autocross.  One of my friends attended with his 98 M Roadster.  After the event, I was given the chance to drive the car.

Even on the first run, not being used to the handling, the car allowed me to turn in one of the fastest times for road tire'd vehicles.

The car feels balanced at all times.  Plenty of feedback as to when you will start losing traction.  If the tail comes around, a simple application of power keeps the tail from coming around.

If you accelerate, the car goes.  When you brake, the car stops.  I own and autocross a Boxster and this M Roadster has much more oomph in second when pulling out of corners.

The bucket seats are more aggressive than the Boxsters, so you are held in place better without a racing harness.  I'm not fat and still found it difficult to get in and out.  You have to turn sideways to slide in and out (with the seat forwards for autocrossing).

Unfortunately, my Boxster was still on snow tires, so I was unable to compare times.

The M Roadster is very exciting to drive.  My hands were shaking after the drive from the adrenalin rush.

Definitely worth considering if you like convertibles that can get up and go.<br><br>
