I would recommend the Photosmart 812 for the amateur user who wants an automatic camera for family or holiday photos. It is very easy to use and gives great results. More serious amateur photographers should look for a camera with through-the-lens focusing and the option of setting shutter speeds or exposure manually.

<b>Review Details</b>
I am considering purchasing my first digital camera and borrowed a Photosmart 812 to see how it would perform. I want a digital camera for the ease of sharing photographs over the Web, rather than printing pictures, since I have family on the other side of the world.

My first impressions of the HP Photosmart 812 were that it is both light and robust. I want a camera that isn't a pain to use and carry with me. This camera seems to fit the bill. I put batteries in the camera and took my first picture straight away before I had read any instructions. I took a picture of my motorcycle in the driveway and was amazed by the results. When I took this picture at the top-level of definition and loaded it onto my computer, I was presented with a very large picture of my bike that had great color and detail. When I zoomed in I could actually see the reflection of my truck in the paintwork of the bike.

The camera has four levels of quality setting, allowing you to trade off more picture space in memory for quality of image. I found that I would probably use the lower picture settings for typical viewing of my images on the Web, meaning that with the image quality set low you can save up to 56 images on the supplied 16 MB memory card.

I tried the video with audio option, which allows the user to record around 30 seconds of video. I wasn&#146t all that interested in this, because if I had wanted a video camera I would have bought one. On playing the video back, I found the picture to be grainy and the audio slushy. Fine for what it is I suppose, but I can&#146t think of an application where I would want to use this feature. You can&#146t turn off the sound recording with the video.

The software that came with the camera was very easy to install and use. I never had to read any of the instructions for the software and was able to upload and share files easily with friends. The software set up four shortcuts on my desktop for different features, which I thought was a little excessive. I read the camera instruction manual. It was adequate, though relied heavily on text over diagrams.

You frame a photograph either by using the traditional viewfinder or the LCD screen on the rear of the camera. I found that the LCD was more accurate for framing pictures, but it was not visible in bright sunshine. Using the LCD also burned up the batteries pretty quickly.

The on-screen menus were very easy to use and toggle through using the navigation buttons on the back of the camera. I found them all to be pretty much self-explanatory.

The camera has 3x optical and 7x digital zoom. Optical zoom will always be better than digital zoom, though I found the digital zoom results to be not bad.

<b>Pros</b>
-	Light and compact
-	Easy to use right out of the box
-	Gives great results with 4 MEG definition
-	Seems robust
-	Audio can be captured with still photographs
-	30 seconds of video mode
-	Direct from camera printing and quick emailing mode
-	Delay mode so you can get yourself into the picture

<b>Cons</b>
-	Heavy battery use
-	Viewfinder not through lens
-	No manual override of automatic settings

<b>In conclusion</b>
I liked the camera very much. It is an ideal snapshot camera and takes away most of the work and worry of getting good photos. I would definitely recommend that you buy the optional docking station and rechargeable batteries as the camera seems to give up on regular batteries way before they have reached the end of their life.

I put some test photos up on the Web showing the zoom feature and the first picture I took of my motorcycle at (cut and paste the whole of the following into your browser):

If you have never owned a digital camera before and are thinking of buying one, you might consider this one. However, digital cameras pose buyers with the same dilemma that purchasers of PCs have faced for years. Whatever you buy, next week there will be a new one available that is much better and much cheaper! Although I recommend the camera, in the end  I have placed an order for the Photosmart 850 instead, because it has through-the lens-focusing, 56x zoom and manual, as well as automatic, operation. If you don&#146t want these features, then the 812 gives virtually the same performance for about $150 less.
UPDATE: Having now owned the Photosmart 850 camera for a couple of weeks I conclude that it is a very superior camera to the 812, especially for indoor photography - Dec 28, 2002.
