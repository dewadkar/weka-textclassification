               When I first got my license, I purchased a 1978 Chrysler LeBaron from my neighbor for only $200.  That car was a sweet automobile: Cream yellow, velour brown interior (faded in areas) and power seats.  I thought I was pretty cool.  That is until it died on me in the middle of the freeway one day.  Cars were zooming past me while the ones behind me were honking furiously.  It wasn't a day I think back to and smile.  That car was dead, and we never started it again.  And that was that.

   After that tragedy, I had to get another car so I asked around and I found out about a Maroon 1989 Dodge Omni a lady was selling across town.  She only wanted $450 for it, so I took some money I had saved and I bought it that week.  Mind you I had already driven and evaluated it and it seemed like a great deal.  There was some paint or clear-coat covering chipping off in places, but I was a teen and I needed this car.  So I drove it home with 175,00 miles on the odometer.  I know in a lot of ways I was asking for trouble with this one, but it turned out to be the best car I have owned.  

   I drove it for almost two years and it never had one problem the entire time.  All it ever needed was its standard oil changes and inspections.  In fact the only reason that I eventually had to get a new car was because of an accident I had that wasn't even my fault.  I missed that car.  It was fantastic.  It was always great on gas and, like I said, it was low maintenance.  It was exactly what I needed.  In fact I have another Omni today.  

   That same neighbor who sold me the Le Baron had a 1990 Omni he was selling.  I knew that my other Omni was a great car, so I knew that this one was going to be better because it was a year newer.  It looked much better than the other one I had and it had 100,000 miles LESS on it than that one.  So I took my the '71 Ford Maverick I was driving in the meantime and sold it and took the money to buy that Omni.  

   I have been driving that car for almost two years now.  I have had very few problems with it like brake pads and tire replacements.  It is also great on gas and it is really fun to take on day trips.  It has been a great car the whole time I have owned it.

   I know that after reading this, everyone is gonna rush out and find themselves a used Dodge Omni, right?  I seriously doubt that, but those of you that do own one know deep down that it has been a good car to you, no matter its looks or lack of power (it being 4 cylinder and all).  Sure it isn't the most appealing car, but from my experience, it has done what it needed to do...get me around.  And being a college student, that's all I can ask of a car right now.  Long live my Omni! (I hope!)
