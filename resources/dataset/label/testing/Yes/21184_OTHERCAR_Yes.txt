            If you only have a limited amount of money to spend on transportation, take a look at the Geo Metro.  Compared to cars such as the Honda Civic, you can get a Metro in newer condition and with less mileage on the odometer - dollar for dollar.  

My life circumstances required me buying either a new motorcycle, or a used car.  I looked around at the car lots and searched the ads in the newspaper, and found that a used Geo Metro fit the bill better than any other vehicle around.  Here's why. . .

Even though it's used, it doesn't eat up money from your wallet.  When I bought it used from the dealer, It only needed a driver side door hinge and a new trunk shelf (this particular car was first a rental for two years, then owned privately but not taken care of one whit for the next two years).  Pretty good for a car that hadn't seen the best of care!  Of course, the car was in great condition upon sale to me.  

For the next 19 months, I've only had to get the air conditioner recharged.  This was a little tricky, as there is a way to do this so that the freon doesn't leak out quickly again.  My shade tree mechanic helped solve this situation very well.  Of course there have been the obligatory oil changes and tire rotations, but nothing else of substance.  

A few annoyances: since I drink out of a 32 ouncer, I have my drink sit in the back floor area with two bricks at each end so it doesn't leak on the floor.  Yes, I could have bought the Civic and had the deluxe drink holder, but I park my Metro at the side of the road, drink, and smile at the money I've saved.  You do have to get used to less horsepower when you merge on freeways, but because I have the patience to drive prudently, I merge safely yet slowly compared to much more powerful vehicles.  The passenger side door insert gets loose at the bottom, and I have to pound with my fist the bottom to get it to seat correctly again.  But these are minor annoyances when you consider the money saved buying the Geo.  

Naturally, the gas mileage doesn't hurt (25 city, 30 to 32 highway *with* automatic).  Manual transmission Geos can do even better than what I get. . .

Interior space is terrific in the front, and even an average sized adult can sit in the back passenger seat on the passenger side of the car - with the front passenger seat scooted up some.  Not for long trips this way, mind you, but around town you can haul around three adults in a pinch!

Needless to say, a Geo Metro is safer than **any** motorcycle in a crash.  Need I say more?  

The model to get is in my opinion the 2 door hatchback version (which comes only in LSI trim).  You get a good amount of luggage space for groceries and even lawnmowers, which the 2 and 4 door notchback trunk models can't carry.
I wish Chevrolet/Geo had continued the station wagon model, but the hatchback works out just fine. . .

So go ahead and look around and compare a $3000 Geo Metro to a $3000 Honda Civic.  You'll find - as I did - that the Honda will be older, more worn out, and in need of an engine rebuild.  Instead, you can just purchase the Geo, which will be newer, less worn out, and probably (in good to excellent condition) won't need an engine rebuild for another 100,000 to 150,000 miles (if it has around 100,000 miles on it, as mine has).  So what if the Geo is slower, and has less "buzz" of a reputation?  It's a sleeper of a find, and well worth finding a good one.
