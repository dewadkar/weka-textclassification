            I have had the pleasure of having two family members own a peice of American history. The 2000 corvette convertible. Arays of beautiful lines and a powerplant that will pin you to the seat plus all the luxury for a tag of about 37,000-45000$ This is simply inquisitive. How can chevy afford to do this? Well either way i guess we both benefit.( You the driver , and them the manufacturer) Even though I do not currently own one, I am usually always found driving around in my cousins. 
A DAY AT THE TRACK
 I'm a huge drag fanatic.. When i took this car down to the track i was matched against a BMW M3. (With a K&amp;N filter)I ran the quarter mile and out ran the M3 by seven tenths of a second. Keep in mind the corvette is stock. The 5.7 Liter 345 horsepower engine roared in pride and laughed at the M3
CRUISING ALONG THE STREETS
 One of the corvettes that my cousin owns has about every manufacturers option possible that you can think of. Every time I've in it , I always hear, hey, how much did that cost? And he tells them and there mouth drops. Only 49,500 dollars for all the factory options. The newly introduced black five spoke wheels made a great addition to the package. 
 So if you want performance, power, luxury, and handling, go ahead and get one of these. Own a piece of American History
