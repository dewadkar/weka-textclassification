            I was ready to buy a Suburu Forester until I actually drove them both. The Forester felt cramped compared to the CR-V. Honda really knows how to design an interior so it is comfortable and user friendly. 

I've had my 1997 CR-V for three years now and my only complaint is that it's a bit underpowered. When going uphill in the higher gears it loses speed and has to shift down continually. Later models have increased horsepower (146), but I haven't driven one to compare. 

I live in the foothills of Colorado and need a car with high ground clearance and All-Wheel-Drive that will automatically kick in when needed. The Honda has done a great job getting me up and down the hilly and curvy road to my house, not to mention getting me out of my unplowed driveway! I like having a good view of the road without feeling like I'm driving a tank. The smaller engine puts its fuel efficiency in the lower 20's.

My CR-V has cruise control, power windows and locks, a CD player (extra) and keyless entry (extra). The only problem I've had is when a mouse built a nest in the A/C fan, and that was easily taken care of. The interior is roomy, but don't expect to fit two car seats and an adult in back.

This is a good car for anyone needing the security of AWD and enough room to haul kids or goods. It's sticker price and gas mileage will appeal to those on a budget. There are more choices in this market than there were three years ago, so be sure to compare before you buy.<br><br>
