            I own a 6spd '96 Collectors Edition coupe, and love it. I previously owned a '92 coupe and will say this is a better car all around. It has less rattles and squeaks, and because of the LT4, it's faster, has more torque and is a lot more fun to drive than the automatic '92. You can't do any better regarding bang for the buck. It has plenty of creature comforts and turns heads regularly, especially with the top out on a sunny day. I am looking forward to spring.

Performance:
The '96 vette with LT4 is rated at 330hp and has as much torque at the peak of the torque curve. Looking at the torque curve, you will see that it rises quickly and doesn't fall off until nearly at the top of the tach range meaning this engine delivers plenty of torque all the way through the power band. I know that this car will pull hard to 140mph because I've done it. I'm not sure what top speed is, as I haven't had a chance to try it yet. 0-60 times are rated under 5 seconds in the 4.8 to 4.9 second range. These performance specs aren't bad, considering I average (when driving it easy) 17mpg in the city and a whopping 31 - 32 mpg on the highway.

Driveability: 
This car sticks to the road like it's on rails, will accelerate like a scalded dog and will make your eyes feel as though they are coming out of your head when making a fast stop. The '96 CE comes with the ZR1 style wheels and brakes, and the brakes are incredible when making quick stops.

Styling:
Short of a C5 (1997 - current year model generation 5 corvette), this is Chevrolet's best looking 'vette, in my opinion. The silver on black color scheme of my '96 CE is nothing short of stunning. Not to blow my own horn, but this car is beautiful. Something about silver on a sports car is sexy as a beautiful woman in a close fitting evening gown. The ZR1 style wheels are the cherry on top.

If you aren't in the market for a fast, fun sports car, don't even think about driving one of these, for if you do, you will yearn to own one. You don't necessarily have to be a fast driver to enjoy this car, but it sure helps to get full enjoyment from the vehicle.

If you are in the market for one of these cars, get one that has the Bose Gold stereo, which I think is a must. This stereo is very nice for a factory unit. The speed controlled volume is a great feature in this stereo. The SCV automatically adjusts the volume in accordance with the speed at which you are driving, compensating for road noise.

Now if I could just find a few Mustang GT's or Cobras to play with ;)
