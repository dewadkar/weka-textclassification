            We bought a 1997 Pontiac Montana.  It is loaded and has the one power door.  We got it brand new in April of 1997.  We bought it for the amenities and the looks.  It is a sharp looking van.  It sits lower than most and just has a sleek look to it.  It also has a great cd and stereo system and controls that you can maneuver from the steering wheel.  It gets decent gas mileage and we haven't had any major problems with it.  But, the downside of this van is the interior.  We noticed right away that it wasn't holding up the way that we thought that it should.  It was under warranty and we have had it to the dealership every couple of months.  There is never anything seriously wrong with it, but it always has a seatbelt broken, or the door molding falling out.  My two most frequent problems are the cup holder in the front has broken 3 or 4 times and the ashtray just fell completely out.  We had never smoked in it.  Other than that, it is a good vehicle.  We love it because of our family and extended family.  You can put seats in, take seats out, etc. and we do this frequently.  Also, all of the seats flip down to make a little tray area with a cup holder if needed.  All in all, it is a decent van, but needs a better interior.<br><br>
