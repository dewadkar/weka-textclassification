            There were plenty of reasons for me to by this 2000 F150 XLT. First and foremost, my old GMC gave up the ghost. It was my most unusual new vehicle purchase. A pleasant, no pressure, buying experience is part of what made this purchase unusual.

I needed a good, reliable pickup to drive to work everyday, do some hauling and tote the kids around. A friend told me about a good deal in the paper so I researched it. It was a two wheel drive, short box super cab with automatic. The price was right and I needed a truck. 

I had no brand loyalty as far as automobiles are concerned so I considered all makes and sizes. I chose the F150 over the ranger because I am 6'2" with two growing kids, and it did not cost much more. I also researched "consumer reports", and found it was recommended with higher marks than the competition. 

My truck has the 4.6 v8, automatic transmission, power locks and windows, tinted glass, four wheel disc anti-lock brakes and tow package. The rear doors are very convenient. The fronts seats fold forward to make it even easier to load the kids in the back. This truck hauls more passengers than our 97 Ford Explorer, six as opposed to five.

It is also a very comfortable ride. My father in law said it was like riding in a car.

I am very pleased with my new truck and recommend it to anyone with or without a family.

This review was written in the wrong model year originally.  That is why I moved it and am updating it.

I have owned the truck for almost three years now and I am still happy with my purchase.  During this time it was recalled because of a mix up in how the options were written up.  Mine came with a tow package but did not come with an upgraded radiator.  When this was pointed out, Ford said no problem and gave buyers three options.  They would pay each affected buyer $100 cash, money off on a new purchase or just upgrade the radiator to the one that sounded like was supposed to be in it.  Ford assured all users the radiator that was originally equipped with the vehicle was sufficient.

I opted for the radiator upgrade.  Since I bought the truck, I have changed the rear end gears to 3:55 from 3:08.  This took my recommended towing capacity from 2000 pounds to over 6000.  I needed to do this so I could pull my 25" travel trailer and it does a fine job.  Changing the gearing means higher rpms to go the same speed and this is why I opted for the radiator upgrade.

Feel free to email me if you have questions about the gear change or f150 in general.
