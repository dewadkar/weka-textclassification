            I purchased a 1999 Lincoln Navigator 4X4 in October 1999, and absolutely love it.  The main reason was the third row seat since we have three children.  The seat also can be removed easily, I have done it myself and although it is heavy, it has wheels that make it maneuver easily.  I like the ride, it is quiet and solid.  Driving it takes a little getting used to because of its size, but it handles extremely well.  I would recommend the vehicle to anyone for towing, hauling family, etc.   

The roominess is great, even in the third seat.  Our kids love it back there, and is great on road trips.  We connected a TV/VCR and it sits on the console between the second row captains chairs.  Works very well!<br><br>
