            I purchased a 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier last year.  It had 56,000 miles on it and other than a crack in the console, showed little wear.  I paid $3,158 dollars for it with tax and I felt it was an excellent bargain. 

The Chevrolet Cavalier is probably the best car I�ve ever owned in overall performance, cost of maintenance, and looks.  It has performed well for me.  It�s little four cylinder motor has a surprising amount of power for merging onto a busy interstate.  It gets about 26 miles per gallon on average when driven sensibly.  The handling is great in almost every type of weather condition.  The anti-lock brakes take some getting used to.  This is the first car I�ve owned that�s had them.  The only thing I�ve had to do to it is change the oil, replace the tires, and change the headlight bulbs.  It�s small exterior hides the very roomy and well appointed interior.  It seems to be very solid not cheap like some of the competitions models. The shear design of the body tells that its sporty from it�s sleek profile to it�s defining lines.

I would recommend this car as a first car for any teenager.  It�s light on the horsepower and light on the wallet.
