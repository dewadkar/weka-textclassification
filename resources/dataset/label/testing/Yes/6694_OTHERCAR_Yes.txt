            My Chevy Beretta has 160,000 miles and is still going strong! I bought it used from a friend and I have really taken poor care of it to be very honest.  I hardly ever change the oil or maintain it in any way.  The only thing I do is put gas in it when it needs it.  I know I'll pay for the poor treatment of my car sooner or later, but even with such a lack maintenance it still drives like a charm. I even live on a country dirt road and that doesnt stop my baby!  When I do decide to buy another you can bet it will be another Beretta.  With a car owner like me, it's got to be a Beretta!<br><br>
