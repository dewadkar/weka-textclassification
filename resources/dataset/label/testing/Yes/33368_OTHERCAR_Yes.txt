            For once I am going to start off by saying what I don't like about this car.  It isn't near as sporty as my Sebring.  But it kills my 'bring in every other category.  After replacing the third alternator on my Chrysler I have decided that it is time to get rid of the car.  I did a truckload of research and decided that the best choice for me would be the New VW Jetta.  I like the new body styling.  Its not thrilling, and nobody in a Ferrari will think it is fast, but I still think it looks pretty good.  I think it will look really great with some 17&quot; Konig rims, and some sport springs, maybe a body kit.  Whatever the car loses in visible excitement, it gains in driving excitement.  The car of my choice is the GLS with the VR6 and 5 speed transmission.  To say it is peppy is a vast understatement.  It does 0-60 in about 7.5.  This is much quicker than my very customized, but extremely heavy Sebring.  The handling was very nice, this can be attributed to the rather small mass of the car.  The body roll is minimal, and will be almost non-existent when I finish with it.  On top of this, the Jetta has a 10 year, 100,000 mile warranty.  that is great because I am just sick of getting alternators and O2 sensors replaced.  I really enjoy this car.<br><br>
