            The Chevrolet S-10 Extended cab, is a great truck.  I've owned one for 9 years now and it still has the same engine that it came with. It is still running great.  It is great for hauling furniture or anything else you might want.  I've also used it pull another vehicle.  This truck is fun to drive and has a better average mile per gallon (25) than most trucks its size.  
While it's an excellent truck, the only drawbacks would be the extended cab.  It is not made for long trips with someone sitting in the cab.  It's quite uncomfortable.  It's not very roomy.  Definitely not recommended for family travel.  It's an excellent buy for a single person, or a family of 2 or 3.<br><br>
