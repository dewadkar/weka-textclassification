            I reseached extensively before I bought my camera so I was prepared for the drawbacks this camera had.  The first of which being the batteries needing about 13 hours to charge.  I was receiving this as a Christmas present so I opened up the box and charged the batteries with the charger that was provided before Christmas...problem solved in advance!!  I opened up the camera on Christmas day and it was so easy to use that I just started taking pictures.  I was pleasantly suprised when I hooked up my camera to the computer and my Windows XP just started 'taking over'.  I never even downloaded the software that came with it and I was able to view my pictures in a matters of seconds.  One of the other drawbacks that was avoided was that I knew that the memory card was not going to be sufficient.  I ordered a 128mb card and extra rechargable batteries so that I could have plenty of charged batteries on hand and I could take what seemed like an infinate number of pictures.  The other 'con' about the camera was the shutter delay, especially when it is on flash but again...knew this before I bought it thanks to Epinions.  Many people list the lack of audio on the movies a con, but if I want to take movies I will use my Sony Digital Camcorder.  Now...if these are the only bad things that I can list about this little mighty mite of a camera, let me tell you that I was stunned that the photos came out so clear.  The ease of use alone for a 1st time digital camera user made the whole experience of taking pictures a pleasure.  It is small and light so it is easy to just throw in the bag and start clickin'.  The camera's lens is protected when the power goes off so I do not have to worry to much about treating it with kid gloves.  I know battery life is a common complaint of this camera, but I just can't see it.  I bought the extra batteries and charged them up expecting the life to get sucked right out of them, but this was not the case.  In any event, having the forethought to buy and charge the additional batteries completely removes this from any 'cons' list.  In closing, I have to say that this camera is fantastic and if I had to do it all over again...I would buy this camera all over again.  To really sum up how much I liked it...I have never written a review before today about any product.  Just had to wait for something like this to come along so I could share my good fortune with others.
