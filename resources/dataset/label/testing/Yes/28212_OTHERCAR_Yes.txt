            Looking for an SUV?  The Durango is heaven on wheels.  Even people who don't traditionally like driving large  vehicles will fall in love after one drive...

To start with, the Durango is roomy.  Passengers in the front, middle, and back seats will find ample leg room and lots of space.  And to top it off, the seats are comfortable - perfect for long trips with family.  There is little cargo space with all 3 seats intact (although more than in a mini-van), but the back seat folds flat into the floor, providing ample room for whatever you need to haul.

As for driving, it handles exceptionally well.  Other than sitting higher, you'd hardly even know you weren't driving a car.  Steering is fairly tight, and control is great, even around curves.  The Durango handles just as well at freeway speeds as it does at lower speeds.  And like most SUV's, it has capabilities to tow anything from a trailer to a boat to another car.

There's gotta be a catch, right?  This can't be the perfect car.  Well actually, there are 2 catches.  The first is that the Durango gets pretty poor gas mileage - a small price to pay for its performance.  The second catch is that you may have trouble finding one with the features and in the color you want.  With the huge popularity of Durangos, many people have had to wait while their dream car was custom built.<br><br>
