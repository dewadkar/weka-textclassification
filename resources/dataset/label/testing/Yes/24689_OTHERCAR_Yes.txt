            We bought our 1997 Chevy Venture right after I found out that we would be having our first child and the Toyota Tercel I was currently driving would not be practical for a carseat. I have found that the automatic sliding door is a lifesaver, especially with a baby/toddler. When you are trying to get groceries, a child and yourself in the van, and its raining, it is wonderful to have that door open for you. I love that we can take individual seats out and that I can do it without the help of my husband if I need to. We also have the extended van, which helps with all of the extra luggage needed to take a toddler anywhere! <br><br>
