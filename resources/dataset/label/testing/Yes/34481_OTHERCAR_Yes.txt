            The Daewoo vehicles are great. I have a Daewoo television, so, I decided to test drive the cars. I thought it was going to be a piece of junk metal like other comparably priced vehicles in the category. But, to my shock and dismay, I really like the way the car looks, drives, and feels. It is like floating on a cloud. The leather interior is so soft. The engine is so smooth and quiet, sometimes I am not sure if it is even running.It is a great car for the first time buyer, or the retiree. it is just an all around great car. I love the all-inclusive warranty and the rebates they are giving on the 1999 models also. My Leganza is fully loaded and I only paid $18,000 for it. There is only one problem, my husband says it is a girl car with a tiny barbie doll engine.(He is a truck guy) But, what does he know?? Everyone else just wants to take it for a test drive. <br><br>
