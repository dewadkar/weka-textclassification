            I don't think that there is any other car that can even compare with the 1999 Honda Prelude. One of my friends had purchased one about two years ago. Up until that time, I'd not a clue as to what it was. He would drive me places and such. While I was in his car I would notice little things about his Prelude that I'd never seen before. For one, his stereo system was really nice. I also like the way the car was designed. A couple of months later, I decided to do some research of my own. I'd found several car magazines and looked online at all the different cars on the market and their comparisons. Once I'd learned more about this car, I knew I had to have it. 

One thing I knew before purchasing this vehicle was that since it was made by Honda, I knew the whole quality of the car had to be well made. There is nothing cheap about Honda cars. This is a quality that I like. When I went to the dealership, they treated me more like a person than an object of persuasion. I liked this also. Another interesting thing about Honda's are that most of their cars come with very little options. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what your looking for and how much you are willing to spend. All of these factors attributed to my decision. If I were to consider any sports car, it would defiantly be the Prelude. <br><br>
