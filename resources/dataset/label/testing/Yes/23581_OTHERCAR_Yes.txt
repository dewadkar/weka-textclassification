               First off let me start by saying I am 17 years old and this was my first car.  Although i've driven other cars before the is300 is the one I have spent the most time with.  So my positive reviews of the Lexus IS300 might just be because this is the only car i've had the most time to experience.  I've had this car since march 2001 and so have just over half a year with it.  

Exterior:

   I never even considered the Lexus IS300 as it was relatively new.  I was originally leaning towards a BMW 3 series however after I saw the IS300 in person I was sold.  The first impression I had was the looks of course.  It was extremely nice looking and stylish in my opinion.  It looked as if it had been lowered and that added to its awesome style.  The front part with its HID headlights looked cool but it was the back that I loved.  I live in an area with a lot of fixed up cars and people had been putting on these altezza/euro lights on the back of their cars and so i've seen them all over the place.  But this was where they originally came from and so it just made the car look even more better.  By the way, I chose the color Millennium Silver Metallic.  I was stuck between that and the Spectra Blue however I did not want to wait for the dealer to get a blue version in inventory.

Interior:

   As i stepped into the car, I just got even more excited.  I noticed the very nice looking aluminum racing pedal and the unique design of the speedometer.  Others have told me that its difficult to read but I have not had any problems with that at all.  The next thing were the seats as the one I purchased had sort of leather seats but also something they called suade i think where it's supposed to keep you from moving in the seat.  I would find this very useful as my driving style is aggressive.

   The interior in the front was perfect for me with easy access to the stereo which also was stylish.  The front seats were roomy and I could easily power back the seats as far as i needed.  The window controls and mirror adjustments were located on the driver door hand rest.  Which brings me to the first thing I didn't like (there's not many however).  The placement of the gas and trunk releases was right under the front seat and I hate having to reach down and unlock it.  I would have rather Lexus place them somewhere on the left hand side under the steering wheel area.  There was an empty area in the center dashboard area and they said it was for the DVD navigation system that was coming with the 2002 models.  I don't use it for anything because it will just fall off on fast turns.

  Another problem is the room in the back seat.  The car is fine if you're mostly driving alone or with an extra passenger however if the car is loaded to capacity the people in the back are going hurt their legs.  It's not much to me since I drove alone a lot but also since i'm not very tall the people are usually comfortable in the back.  It may not be the same if the driver is tall and then the person behind him will be looking for more leg room.  This is a compact performance car so I guess that's justified.  

   The center in the backs eat can fold to be an armrest.  It also contains a zipped pouch where you can access the trunk for those times when you may want to carry something long such as ski poles or something.  

   The trunk has enough room for my needs but the only thing is I can't really add subwoofers or else I would have to give up my trunk space just for speakers and not carrying space.  The spare tire and necessary tools are under the trunk mats.  There is an included first aid kit with velcro backing that is attached to the side of the trunk and also a little area to tie up the car manuals on the other side.  

   The sound system of the IS300 was more than adequate.  It wasn't a Mark Levinson system as found on the higher priced Lexus models but I felt that this was great sounding.  It could have used more bass but then again that's just me being a teenager and wanting to make the car vibrate with bass.  I also liked the in dash CD changer as I never did like the idea of having to get inside the trunk to change a CD.  

  There's also this feature for the radio where you can press a button and it'll scan frequencies around the area in which you're in and place them in categories such as easy listening, rock, misc.  If some stations broadcast their names, it will show up in the display (for example, it would show KIIS-FM instead of 102.7).  And if any stations had messages, you could press a message button and it would read a line of text that they were sending out.  I haven't encountered many stations that use that though.  There's a small area under the stereo console to place things such as sunglasses or whatever you want.  

Driving:
   
   This car is fast.  Every time I press the pedal it immediately responds with power and the rated 7 seconds 0-60(i believe) is evident.  Yet with the power it handles great.  There have been many times where I have taken this on the freeways of L.A. and it's just always feel as you're in complete control.  I've had to stop the car a few times in a short amount of time and the brakes did a good job of stopping the car from a fast speed.  I do not know how to drive a manual transmission and so I was curious with the e shifting feature.  It was fun at first playing with it however nowadays I mainly just leave it in automatic and that's good enough for me. 

   There are times when I do need a boost and so I switch it over to the manual by moving the shift knob to the left and it puts you into 5.  Hitting the downshift buttons that are behind the steering wheel (upshift buttons are on the front) gives me that extra amount of speed want.  Or else I'll use the ECT button that works just as well.  I have heard from another owner that pressing the trac button off will also help speed it up but I am not sure if i want to do that.  I would think traction is something a driver wants to have.  The car is fairly light compared to heavier cars I have driven such as the GS 300 and S500.  That is what I like about the car.  It's light and quick.  The fastest I've gone with it so far is 125mph and it just went flying over the road. 

   Another thing with the driving is the quietness of the engine.  I can barely hear anything with all the windows rolled up and closed.  There is the engine noise if I don't shift up and leave it on high rpms but other than that it's a quiet ride. 

Extras:
  
   I got all the available options on the 2001 model except for heated front seats.  The 17inch chrome rims from the Lexus dealer are very nice looking after a good wash.  I've had many people turn their heads looking at the car, yet as more IS300's are on the road it's happening less often.  I also opted for the rear spoiler also from the Lexus dealer and I prefer the way it looks with it.  Looking at the ones without a spoiler, it just feels like it's not making the statement it could with that added part.  The sunroof will help it look even sportier if you tilt it up, however even without it, it's already has the looks.  I don't remember if it came with floor mats or if it was an option but I do have them and they look nice especially with IS300 printed on them.  

Final:

   After all these months, I'm still in love with the car.  I would not trade it for anything else except maybe for the newer 2002 models.  I happy with the choice I made and the IS300 still gives me an exciting ride just like it did when I first took it for a drive.
