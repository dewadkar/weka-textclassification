            The new Ford Taurus is a great new car. But when my dad bought his, I didn't think so from the looks of it. His is green so I quickly nick-named it &quot;The Turtle.&quot; My opinion of the vehicle quickly changed when I drove it. I was amazed at the power it had. The first thing I noticed was the pickup. I barely touched the petal and it took off. I also noticed the good looks of the interior. It was also comfortable and roomy. I think Ford did a great thing in redesigning the Taurus. The only thing I didn't like about the car was the looks, but ive gotten used to it. I would suggest this car to anyone trying to find an inexpensive and powerful vehicle. And another thing, we have had it for about three years and have not had a single problem with it.<br><br>
