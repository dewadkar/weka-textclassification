                 Let me start off by saying that i put in some quality time researching for my digital camera purchase.  I found a great package in the 2020z.  This camera doesn't look like much when you first take a look at it but i guarantee you'll fall in love with it after a few minutes of use.  If you know even the littlest about photography, u can figure this camera out w/o the instructions, but keep em handy, it's quite the thicky.  
     First of all, it fits like a glove.. i was initially unattracted by its puniness( i like chunky electronics), but i then realized that size isn't everything.  LCD is great and not that big, which is actually better cuz you won't drain those batts. comes with 4 NiMh which can be annoying to change with tough door to close but no biggie.  Also, the lens cap needs to be attached to the camera, i almost lose it everytime i use it.  
     User interface couldn't be any simpler, and most of the stuff you adjust can be seen on the top LCD so you can use the viewfinder more.  Battery life is apparently better than the 2000z and i must say it is better than expected.  
     Playback mode is really well designed with zoom and indexing feature.  Picture quality more crisper than fresh celery.  Plus the many different types of adjustable qualities lets you make so much out of the 8mb included card. it would be nice if it had a USB out port but you can buy a usb reader.  
      Okay... here's the kinda junk thing.  One of the bigger things that attracted me to this camera was being able to shoot quicktime movies. It works fine but SILENT MOVIES are a bit outdated. It needs SOUND.  so if you like catching musical moments like i do, well you can't...Another thing is that you can't do many 1 min. clips on that 8mb, so if you plan on fully utilizing the movie mode as well as taking pics on a single venture, get bigger and/or more smartmedia cards.  
     The camera also has a manual mode and most aspects are adjustable and prioritizable.  The options let you adjust almost anything you want, even the noise of the pushbutton beeping.  I haven't gotten used to focussing manually using up and down buttons, it can be a little drag compared to turning a lens but it's still well enough designed. 
     The 2020z is an AWESOME DIGICAM.. is it worth that high price? well i'm still trying to figure that out, but more and more i do believe it is a good value. It takes great hiquality pics.  Plus, it looks cooler than an Igloo.<br><br>
