            This is my first real digital camera.  There is a 1.5 mega pixel camera in my camcorder, but I don't count that one due to its low quality pictures.  The Sony DSC-P10 is a great all-round, easy to use, digital camera.  As of this review, I've take over 200 photos with this camera under many different lighting conditions.

Put this camera in it's full auto mode, and all you have to do is point and shoot.  The automatic exposure has not failed me yet.  The color accuracy is dead-on with each shot.  The only two shots that were unacceptable were due to shooting at night without a tripod.  The images were properly exposed, just blurred due to my camera movement.  During a tour of a house were flash photography was not permitted, I simply turned off the flash and the focus light on the camera while leaving it in full automatic mode.  All interior shots came out looking fantastic.  I just made sure I held the camera extra steady while taking each shot.  I was the only one in our tour group of 15 people that took any indoor shots.

The camera can record 5 to 40 seconds of sound with each shot.  It does this by saving the photo in a jpeg file, and the sound in an mpeg file with a thumbnail of the photo included.  It&#146s pretty cool to have the sights and sounds of the sea lions we discovered during one trip.

The video capability of the camera is impressive.  It doesn&#146t match the quality of my digital camcorder, but at 17 fps, it looks pretty good.  You can also shoot as much as the memory stick can hold.  This camera accepts the Sony memory sticks including the newer memory stick pro format.  I purchased a 256 mb memory stick pro and it works fast and flawlessly.  This camera is also fast, only taking about 1.5 seconds between shots.

In the 5 mega pixel mode, the jpeg files average 2 meg per file.  But the top and or bottom of each shot will have to be cropped if you print to borderless 4X6 photo paper.  You can easily switch to the 4.5 mega pixel mode to perfectly fit a 4X6 borderless print.  A minor annoyance is the fact that the see-thru viewer does not show as much image as the LCD monitor on the back.  Thus, in outdoor sunlight, were the LCD is washed out, you have to use the see-thru viewer, but just realize the picture you take will be larger that the image you see thru the viewer.  I think this is a minor inconvenience due to the high quality of pictures this camera takes.  You can easily crop a photo that you are going to print, even up to 8X10 size.  I am still amazed at the quality of images I&#146m getting from this camera when printed on my $140 Canon printer with good quality photo paper.

I have carried this camera in my pocket on several occasions.  It&#146s that small.  It doesn&#146t require a case due to it&#146s metal body and self covering lens.  I found the menu system awkward at first, but soon got used to it.  Since I shoot primarily in automatic mode, I can&#146t really comment on the manual setting capability of this camera.  When you put the camera in the manual mode, each aspect of the camera is automatic until you override it manually.

I have not enjoyed taking pictures like this in a long time.  The ability to shoot as much as I want and only print the best is a great money saver.  My creativity is not limited either.  With the 32 mb stick that comes with the camera, my 256 mb stick I purchased with the camera, and the 128 mb stick I already owned, I can take over 160 pictures at the highest quality setting.  Unloading pictures through it&#146s USB 2.0 compatible port is fast.  This camera meets all of my photo needs now and for many years to come.  If you are looking for a small digital camera that takes high quality photos for casual use, this camera is the one.
