My dad bought this car in August 1999 after his car unexpectedly "kicked the bucket." My mom, at the time, had a 1995 Saturn SL1, and as she was pleased with it, he found this car. It was barely used at the time with maybe 10,000 miles on the odometer. He gave it to me toward the end of my junior year of high school, and I've driven it ever since. 

<b>What I Like About My Car</b>: I like that it's still running well, for one. See, I have unfortunate luck sometimes, and as a result, my car and me have been in four accidents together, varying from a fender bender to really bad. None have been my fault, if you're curious. The last wreck I got in, almost a year ago, I was rear ended on the interstate - I was stopped, the Taurus behind me plowed into me while going 60mph. My car was nearly totaled - but she pulled through just fine, and I was relatively unhurt. (a few bumps, but nothing major) She's been fine since then, with no repairs needed, just the usual maintenance and oil changes. Plus, the plastic panels on the sides make denting a non-issue. 
I love the gas mileage. I go to school in Conway,AR - yet my permanent address is Memphis, TN; about 180 miles apart. Even though my gas tank is only 11 gallons, I can get from school to home on less than half a tank of gas; impressive, especially these days, with the rising gas prices!  The cruise control is mounted on the steering wheel and is highly intuitive and simple to figure out. 

<b>What I Don't Like</b>: This car is a cheap American car, and there are times where this is very evident by the excessive rattles coming from the dash or door. It's not harmful, just annoying. It's also not consistent - sometimes it rattles a lot, sometimes I can go for days without hearing a thing. Also, the fabric on the seats really could've been a better quality - the tan shows dirt and fades like nobody's business. Speaking of the interior, I absolutely hate the layout. The power window controls are in the center console, as is the power mirror control. The passenger side mirror is the only mirror that's power, the driver side is manual, which strikes me as highly stupid. The cup holders, when occupied by a cup, block access to the AC/heat. The seats are fine for short haul trips, but anything longer than a few hours and your back will not like you much. I rectified this partially by buying a lumbar seat cover. Taller people will also not like this car; I'm 5'5, so I fit just fine. My ex-boyfriend is 6'5 - his knees were nearly in his chest when he sat in my car. 

As a whole, I really like my car. Sure, it has its issues, and I would not recommend it as the main family car. But for a couple or for a student, it's a wonderful car. My car has never broken down, leaving me stranded *knocks on wood!*. My main problems are with the interior of the car, but they're not such big deals really - my car shines where it matters (reliability and gas mileage), so I would recommend it highly. If you get a Saturn, enjoy it - my family has owned six in the last seven years! (And there's only three of us!)
