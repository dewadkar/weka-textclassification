                 When I turned 16 and got my license my dad gave me his old truck.  It was an 86 GMC S-15 king cab.  It had the smaller of the two six cylinder engines available, and my dad had bought it new.  When I received the vehicle it had about 205,000 miles on it, and my dad had kept it pretty stock and pretty clean.  

     The truck had plenty of room up front for just about anyone.  However the back was a different story.  The folds out seats were barely big enough for a ten year old to sit in, and left no legroom if two people sat in the back.  The bucket seats up front were quite comfortable for several hours, and the truck had good visibility all around especially in front.  The ergonomics were designed well, and everything was in reach, and there was no need to look away from the road when you were driving.

     When I received the truck, there where a few things that were noticeable, the first of which was how sturdy the truck was.  When you closed the door it felt like there was a door their.  This was also apparent when you tried to accelerate.  Because I had the smaller of the 6 cylinder engines, the truck was a bit sluggish.  Being a teenager i wanted something fast and this did not fit that description.  It wasn't that the truck didn't have power, it had loads of torque, and horse power.  But all of this was lost in lower end gearing.  It was a automatic, but it still had a relatively low shift point, but this is common on most American vehicles.  Due to the vehicles weight I felt VERY safe in this truck.  Before I had the truck, my dad had hit a deer in it and only broke a headlight.  About six months before I sold it I also hit a deer, I was doing about 70 miles an hour (I was in a 65 zone) and a caught sight of a deer running towards the road in my peripheral vision.  I hit the deer and it flew about three lanes across the road.  When I stopped to inspect the damage I was waiting to see a puddle from my radiator, and no headlights from such a high speed collision, I was amazed to find out that the only damage was a little bit of broken plastic.  Part of the grill, not much had been broken, and some of the plastic around my headlight was gone, but that was it.  This is why the truck is a tank on wheels.  Its a little underpowered or geared wrong, but it makes up for this in safety.

     To top of the safe feeling and sturdy feeling the truck had, it was mechanically sound.  When I sold the truck at 240 thousand miles, i had never had any kind of breakdown in the years I had it, and neither did my dad since he had bought it new.  The extent of the mechanical work that we had done to the vehicle is this.  We changed the radiator, the original had cracked from bad washboard on the road to our house, a water pump went south at about 214 thousand miles.  I also had to replace the starter at about 235 thousand miles, and the fuel filter near the same time (which is suppose to be done every 60 thousand if memory serves me right).  The down side in mechanical work was when things did go bad which was rare; they were a pain to fix.  The starter and the fuel filter were impossible to get to, and I had to take the truck to a shop.  The transmission clunked from time to time, but any automatic will do that.  Also when under heavy load in four-wheel drive it slipped out from time to time.  I know this cause I loved to take my truck off road and in the snow and mud.  Great truck for the buck, and it was the best first car a teen could hope for.<br><br>
