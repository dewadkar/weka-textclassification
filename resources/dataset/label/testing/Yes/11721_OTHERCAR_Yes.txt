            I spent forever trying to figure out which camera to buy.  I wanted one with great photo quality and one that was simple enough for a digital camera first timer.  And I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. I found exactly what I wanted!!  

This camera takes great shots.  Nice and crisp, and great color.  The shutter lag time is a little annoying, but having never had a digital before, I've got nothing to compare it to other than a film camera.  And you get used to it.

I love the LCD - I haven't had a problem seeing the image in low light or too much light.  It's also adjustable, just in case.

I love the movie mode - it's movie with sound, and the length is only limited by the size of your memory card.  You can also edit the movies on your camera.  The multi-burst feature takes 16 shots in a row and saves them as a single image.  My only issue with both of these features is you can't use the flash with them.

I also LOVE the burst-2 feature.  Again, no flash, but it takes 2 quick pictures and saves them individually so you can pick the better one to keep.  This has been a life-saver with my kids.  It makes it a little easier to get that perfect shot. 

It also has an email mode that saves each shot twice - once in a high resolution, and a second in a lower resolution for emailing.

Also, you can add voice memos to each shot that you take.

I haven't had any problems with the rechargeable batteries.  They are 2100mAh and last a surprisingly long time.  And I always use the flash and the LCD.  The recharge is pretty quick.

Macro mode works well, and there are a few flash settings, including red-eye reduction.  You still get some red-eye, but it's not bad.  This camera actually has a flash that sits pretty far from the lens - helping to reduce the red-eye effect naturally.

Zoom works well, although I only cared about the optical zoom.

This camera has a nice weight and fits well in my hands.  

I haven't used the viewfinder - I prefer the LCD screen.

About the blurry image thing - I don't know a whole lot about advanced features.  I was having a problem with blurry images, so I talked to my photographer brother-in-law.  He said I didn't have enough of a light source.  I love the burst 2 (which won't let you use the flash) and was taking most of my pictures indoors with low light.  Now I stick to bright lights or outdoors when I use the burst 2.  I haven't had a problem since.

I bought this in June 03 for $329 and it came with a free 128MB memory stick.  A must have!!  The 16MB stick that comes with it works well as a back up, but doesn't have room for very many pictures, and even less video.
