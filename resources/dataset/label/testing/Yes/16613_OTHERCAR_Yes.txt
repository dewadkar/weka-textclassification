            I had not even considered a Cadillac Catera when first looking for a replacement for my 1991 Saturn SL.  Having seen several Cateras in the area, I was impressed by their sporty good looks.  I had test driven several cars around the $30K mark and was not quite satisfied with any of them.  Then I noticed in the paper that a local Cadillac dealership was selling their remaining 1999 models at $10,000 off the sticker price.  That enticed me to take a test drive.  The salesman tossed me the keys, and said &quot;Here, take the car for the day&quot; (in spite of the fact that I left him a beat up old Saturn and wore a ponytail at the time).  I now have owned this car for nine months.

This car is fun to drive.  The Catera's handling is very good and acceleration surprisingly strong.  The engine makes a nice growl as I put my foot into it, and the transmission's sport mode puts a grin on my face as it shifts firmly through the gears.  This car is deceptively quiet when traveling at 70+ MPH down the highway - and yearns to be driven much faster.  I have been averaging about 22 MPG using super unleaded in town.

The interior of this car abounds in luxury.  With excellent leather power driver and passenger front seats, heated front and rear seats, power sunroof, power rear sun shade, fantastic Bose CD/Cassette stereo.  The dual zone climate control system makes most competitors' systems look like toys.  The air conditioning system cools quickly even after sitting in a parking lot when it is 105 degrees outside.  The Catera comes complete with all the gauges one would expect in a sports car - fuel, voltage, oil pressure, water temp, tach and speedo.  The goofy cup holders in the center console take some getting used to - when holding a drink it becomes difficult to operate the console mounted transmission lever.

The external styling is OK - could be better, about what I would expect on a 4 door sport sedan.  The Cadillac chrome wheels and rear spoiler enhance the car's sporty appearance.  The car is very aerodynamic and wind noise is kept to a minimum.  The full width tail lights and black chrome front grill are classy and separate this car from most others on the road.

I do all of my own maintenance on all of my vehicles (have a truck and SUV as well).  I have not had to take my Catera back to the dealer for anything.  Nothing has broken or malfunctioned.  This has been an excellent car and I would highly recommend it to anyone, but not at the $39,000 original price.  This car should have been priced in the low 30s to be competitive.
