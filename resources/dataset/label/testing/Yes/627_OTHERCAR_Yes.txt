            I bought this camera for my husband for Christmas, and he absolutely loves it. It's small, lightweight, easy to carry with you, and takes wonderful pictures. What more can you ask for in a camera?

We had a small Agfa camera, without all the features of the Nikon before we got the Coolpix. It's clear that quality is the top priority with the Nikon. The pictures are far superior to the Agfa's, and so is the viewfinder. (Although it's still hard to use. Anyone who's used to a 35mm viewfinder will probably find a digital camera viewfinder difficult at best. It moves, and it moves very slowly, so it's difficult to compose the picture. If you're looking for point-and-shoot capability, this isn't it.)

Not having to use film is a huge asset with digital cameras. I find that we tend to take many more pictures than we would with a film camera, knowing that we can quickly discard the bad ones, and keep the good ones. I think it makes for much better photography, and cheaper in the long run.

Photos are simple to upload to your computer. We have a memory stick that fits into a device hooked into my husband's computer. The memory looks like a small floppy drive, and is read just like a floppy by the computer. You can quickly pull up your photos, save the ones you like, and discard the rest. (You can also do this as you shoot.) My husband has Adobe Photoshop, and we can also manipulate the photos before we save them or send them to friends. The digital camera has been invaluable for photos that go with the articles I write, and also for saving special photos of friends and events. Memory can be upgraded, so you can add more photo capability, and also add rechargeable batteries, which last longer.

Battery life is good, not great. The more features you use on the camera (zoom, view photos, delete photos, etc.) the more battery life you use. We've found the batteries last for hundreds of photos, but it also depends on how often you use the camera. We keep a spare set in the charger, so we always have a fresh set, if we get low.

The camera has many features, like a zoom lens, double exposure, wide angle, and exposure control. I haven't read the manual, and have been able to shoot some elementary photos just picking it up and shooting. I would recommend reading the manual however, as there are so many other features you can use if you know how.

This is a great camera, especially if you're going to use it for both business and pleasure. We use it all the time, and really enjoy the pictures we've taken so far. Digital cameras rock, and the Coolpix is one of the most awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality digital camera.
