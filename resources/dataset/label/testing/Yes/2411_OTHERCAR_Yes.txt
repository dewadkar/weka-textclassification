            This Jeep was purchased new in 1995. It was one of the best purchases every made. This vehicle has performed like a charm for 5 years and is still going strong. It is still on the original set of tires and has not given any trouble. Only one time a wire came off the distributor and that has been the extent of the problem. That is a mechanical error that could happen with any.

The vehicle was bought as a general utility vehicle. It was to haul kids, groceries and the like. It has performed up to par with a lot of room. Now that the kids are gone it is our primary traveling  or may I say touring car. It rides well and I am never concerned about the reliability of the vehicle. If we are in rough terrain the four wheel drive will be there to pull us through.

This vehicle looks great. It has a terrific look and yet it can go where we want it to.

I would not hesitate in recommending the Jeep to anyone. As with any vehicle, this one has been taken care of and not abused. I hope it to continue for quite some time.<br><br>
