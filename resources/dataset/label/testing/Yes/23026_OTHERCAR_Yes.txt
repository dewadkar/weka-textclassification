            I am new to the digital camera world, but after one week, I feel like an expert with this camera... It is so simple to use, I have used much more complex 35 MM Cameras...It comes with all of the tools to have your photos up on the internet in just a matter of minutes...Included in my kit were the batteries, a protective carry case and strap, AC power adapter, all cables to connect to computer, the Polaroid PhotoMax Imagemaker Software and the PDC640 camera...The pricing was unbeatable in my book...It retails for $199 regularly, this week it is at Wal-Mart for $179....I got mine at WalMart's 5-hour sale on Friday after Thanksgiving for $99....I have been using it for EBay auctions for less than a week and already have my money back... You would do yourself some serious justice to check this unit out, whether you are an expert or a beginner...Many of the bells and whistles that come on the $600 cameras...such as a memory card, an LCD viewfinder and an optical viewfinder...and a flashpath floppy disk adapter to convert images from the memory card to floppy disks..I have already recommended to family and friends...<br><br>
