            For those of you who are unfamiliar with my work, I urge you to read my review of the 1992 Honda Prelude (My Dream Car) for a more in depth analysis of my obsession with the Prelude, and for Hondas in general. 

It has now been four years since I was forced to part with my Black on Black 1992 Honda Prelude for the sake of my family. Since that time I have been schlepping around in various Pontiacs, while my wife has been enjoying the 1997 Honda CR-V we traded the Prelude in for. The Pontiacs got me from A to B, but that was it. They were the right price (thanks Dad), and they did what they had to, but... Once you drive a Prelude it stays in your blood forever. And now after 4 long years I am happy to say that the Prelude in no longer in my blood, it is in my driveway once again! 

Two months ago I purchased a 1996 Prelude S 5-speed from a guy who didn't drive it anymore because he had recently purchased a new BMW 330ci (good excuse). Even before he bought the Beemer he rarely drove it because he took the train to work on a daily basis. That was great for me because the car only had 62,000 miles on it, barely even broken in for a Honda. I jumped on it. I test drove it on a Wednesday, brought my auto saavy father in law out to check it out on Thursday, made an offer with his approval and had the keys in my hand by Saturday. I paid $7,900 for it, a bit below blue book value because it needs new tires, and because it sat outside most of the time, the paint job needs work. The only things I didn't like about this car are... 1) It's red. I've never been a big fan of red cars, Cops tend to like them... 2) It had the gold emblem kit, which I also don't like, and they are badly tarnished, and... 3) The custom wheels the first owner put on are nasty and scratched up from poor city parking jobs. I quickly got over these hurdles because they can be easily fixed, and the car runs great so there you have it.

Before I go further I have to thank my wife for letting me get this car. Our daughter is now nearly four years old, and is very able to crawl out of the back seat, so she saw no reason why I had to get a 4 door sedan. In fact she pushed me to get a car that would be fun to drive, but it had to have a back seat. I had been looking at 1998-2002 Honda Accord Coupes, and was ready to buy one but the seller sold the car before I had my loan secured. I was looking to spend between $12,000-$15,000, so I also looked at the 1997-2001 Preludes. I was having no luck on the newer Preludes, they were either too expensive or had too many miles on them. 

Since I got this Prelude at such a good price, I will be able to make some "upgrades" to it. But I'll get to that later. 

Lets talk about the car and why I love it. 

The first thing I love is... it's a Honda. The car is made great. Like all other Hondas Preludes are great cars. They get great gas mileage ( I usually get well over 25 mpg in the city), they give you very little trouble, and Preludes are fun to drive especially if you get a 5-speed! 

My car is the Prelude S, which is the lowest model trim. The Si is the next step up and the VTEC (arrrr, arrrr, arrrr) is the top of the line. The Prelude S has a 4 cylinder engine, and has 135 horsepower. Not a rocket but it puts your butt against the seat when you accelerate, and it drives like a sports car. The S also comes equipped with 14 inch wheels which I highly recommend upgrading to 15" or 16". And lets talk about those Prelude S wheels... The nasty plastic wheel covers have got to go! Luckily the first owner of this car got rid of them and replaced them with not quite as nasty 14" alloys. To me if you are going to upgrade the wheels, you might as well go with bigger wheels for better looks and performance, but I'll be doing that soon anyway.

In my humble opinion the 1992-1996 Prelude is the best looking of all the Prelude body styles. The curves of this car are beautiful. Even though it is an older style, it does not look dated because of the beauty of the styling. I once read that Honda designed this style to appeal to women, but as a man, I think it looks muscular and it sits low like a freaking rottweiler. The garage where I take my Hondas for regular maintenance also sells used Hondas and Acuras, and they have a waiting list of people looking for this style of Prelude. The newer style (1997-2001) never had the following of this one. 

The interior of this car was ahead of it's time. The gas and temperature guages are all digital, and they look like you are in a spaceship. I have read opinions of people who hate them, but I love them. The interior wraps around you like you are in a cockpit, and all of the controls are easily reached. One thing that I didn't notice about my first Prelude was how nice the seats are. They really hold you when you are tearing around corners. Something I had always taken for granted until I drove the bench seat Pontiac. The back seat is cramped, but you can fit a car seat back there, and my daughter dosen't complain about it. Adults who have to sit back there do complain however. Tell them to shut up! It's a sports car, and it's better than walking! 

There are two huge improvements from the 1992 to the 1996. The first is that the console that used to seperate the backseats in the 1992 is gone (I think they got rid of it in the 94 model) making more room in the back. The other is the addition of a cup holder in the front. Gone are the days of  spilled Coca-Cola from trying to wedge the drive-thru cup in between the the emergency brake and the passenger seat! Other than those things the interior remains the same. 

I'm not a big engine guy, so I'm not sure what changes were made under the hood from 92 to 96. The 1996 is every bit as much fun to drive as the 1992, if not more since I have become a better driver in the last four years. 

Now let's talk upgrades. The first thing I did was get rid of the low quality stock speakers. I replaced them with 6 1/2" Infinity 6002 shallow fits. It makes the 6 Disc CD Changer sound much better. I am also going to replace the tailights with the clear Altezza style that is very popular now. I think these make a nice contrast with the red paint. As mentioned before I will be installing larger wheels and tires, in the near future. A five start wheel desighn looks very nice on this body style, but it dosn't look really flashy. I will also be painting the car, either repainting it red to make it look less aged, or if I can afford it, I may change the color to white. White cars seem to age better than black. 

Overall I can not recommend this car enough to anybody who is looking for a fun to drive sports coupe. This is my second Prelude and I could not be happier with my purchase.
