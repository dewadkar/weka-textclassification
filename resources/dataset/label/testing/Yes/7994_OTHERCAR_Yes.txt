            Land Rover is a company known for making quality 4x4's that are giant steps above and beyond other measly sport utility companies.Being only 21 when purchased this vehilcle I was naive to say the least.The dealer took a good chunk of my income and stuck me with a used Rover with no warranty and a fuel pump that broke just days after I got it.So the first thing to know is get a warranty any of them will do, just as long as you can find out if you got a lemon.After many weeks in the shop the dealership finally diagnosed the fuel pump as the culprit.Now I was doing some research on how much this repair would cost me, the dealer said 670$ but the figures I had were only 370-450$.Now tell me people are honest.

But I must admit the first time I hoisted myself into the cockpit for my elusive test drive the vehicle was a winner.Rough rides are a thing of the past in these trucks.Air suspension and automatic ride height adjustment are only a few of the wonderous features about the suspension that seperates a rover from a regular sport utility.Let's face another fact Land Rover only makes sport utility vehicle, so thet know what they are doing,after all it is Britain's Best!Besides my personal problem with the dealer I bought it from the range rover I got is a dream come true.And it was a tough decision to make,you could buy any sport ultilty you wanted,and my choice was the right one.

Not to sound sexist but a Land Rover is a man's vehicle.If you truly like to baby your rust bucket then get a rover and forget the mechanic,this car is very easy to maintain if you do it yourself.I'm not saying rebuilding the engine is simple,I mean maintenace,because a Range requires alot of attention,the little things like oiling various parts of the suspension and undercarriage.These are things you should be doing anyway to any car to be truthful, besides oil changes and such.A rover is the ultimate vehicle for people who like to off road of course,it provides all the comforts of a luxury and adds more to it.

Heated seats,subwoofer included,excellent sound system,power everything,even adjustable arm rests!And if you get the LWB version you get an extra 8 inches of space to roll around in,lef space especially!Not to mention a bigger engine and slightly better gas mileage.Plus leather and so much other stuff I can't even remeber,once you go onto a dirt road you will appreciate these vehicles.But like every vehicle made there are some problems,the fuel pump I mentioned above is the #1 problem on this vehicle so if you buy used check the fuel pump at all costs.<br><br>
