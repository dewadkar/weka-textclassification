            I test drove a '01 Grand prix GTP sat after I drove the olds intrigue.
What a difference. I did not notice any styling changes other the color of the car I drove from the '00 year.  I just love the muscular look of this car.  Although the engine is an old fashioned 3800 series II, It more than does its job.  It has a real engine rumple even though it is a 6 cyl, bring it around the corner, step on the peddel (i didnt dare to floor it because i was thrown back in my seat and the car was already at 65-70 mph before I could blink my eyes)  I noticed the supercharger gage on the dash and all the funky lights.  I heard the engine roar and voom.  I didnt even feel the transmission shift and it was so smooth and quiet riding it.  The leather seats were heated and i did not want to get out. With the power lumbar and everything such as radio controls on the steering wheel and the hud display where you can see your dash projected up onto the windshield of the car you do not need to take your eyes off the road.  The climate control system was simple to use and was powerful and quiet as well.  It was dual zone digital so each front seat can have their own temp setting and never have to adjust it again (its too hot in here...  now its too cold...)
the radio was great.  loud, clear, and great bass.  There were 8 speakers and no attenna and the dealer said it was in the back window of the car.  Guess it must of been.  All the stations I listened to were static free  It had the onstar sys in it and pwr everything incl trac control and abs.  win/drl/mirrors locks/security sys/keyless entry lighting package.  Ok you get the point<br><br>
