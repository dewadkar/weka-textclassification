            I bought this car about a year ago now and I've been extremely happy with it despite a few quirks when I first got it.  

The one thing that annoys me is that there is only one odometer to show 2 trips plus total mileage.  That means that you have to keep switching back and forth between them to see total mileage (for oil change timing) and to see trip mileage (for gas consumption).  If there was one total mileage odometer and one trip odometer, it would be SO much better.

The fold down back seat is very useful for transporting long objects.  The back seat is OK for adults but a bit cramped.  The front seat is comfortable.

I bought the car because it is quite safe and reliable for a car in this price range. I also wanted a small car because I live in Chicago and parking is tough.  Plus, this car is the same thing a the Toyota Corolla.

When I first got it there were a few minor problems (e.g., my cd player sometimes did weird things), but a trip to the dealership fixed them all.

The ride is smooth and reasonably quiet.  The sound system is quite good for the price.  Pickup is good.  I got ABS brakes and alloy wheels, as well as the upgraded transmission.  If you get one, pay the extra for the upper level transmission, it is much better.

In my one year of ownership I have no complaints at all.  I think that's rare in a car.
