            My wife and I just recently purchased a 1999 Millenia S (almost identical to the car pictured, pearl white and sand mica trim). We were not really looking to get into a Mazda product, but considering the fact that my Ford Explorer is a Mazda product (yes...the Ford Explorer and Ford Ranger are both Mazda chassis) we liked the quality.

We were immediately attracted to the style and design of the 1999 Millenia S and instantly fell in love with the car and took a pick of one of the two cars on the dealers lot. 

The interior comfort and smooth ride sets it apart from the other cars in its class. I would recommend this car to anyone that wants a luxury car without paying a high luxury price. As stated in other reviews, this luxury car is a well kept secret (I don't see too many on the road, which is good because of the lack of saturation, the car will hold its value longer).     <br><br>
