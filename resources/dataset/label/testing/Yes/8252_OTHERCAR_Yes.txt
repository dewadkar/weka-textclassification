            This camera was recommended to us by the store manager at Radio Shack where we purchased it.  Originally I was going to buy a smaller camera for the same price, but this camera had better features.  It was very easy to set up and use and when we printed an 8X10 picture out on our printer (which is not an expensive or high quality printer)you couldn't tell the difference from a high quality 35mm print.  When you zoom in on the picture after downloading to the computer it's still crystal clear at full enlargement.  The camera is no bigger than most regular 35mm cameras and has excellent zoom (6X).
 The camera comes with alkaline batteries, but they only last for a few minutes.  We went through 3 sets of alkaline batteries the first night.  Although after purchasing 2 sets of NIMH rechargeable batteries we have had no problems. I would recommend getting an AC power adaptor for this camera to leave by the computer.
 You can even take 60 seconds of video clips with this camera although the sound quality is poor.  We were able to get 59 pictures on the memory card once, but usually only average about 45 before it is full.  
 The date and time can be set on the camera and it can also be set so that it shows on every picture.  Although you do have to turn this feature on every time you turn the camera off and back on again.  
 When I first started using the camera I only read enough of the instruction manual to tell me how to download the pictures into my computer.  I have now read the whole manual and found it very informative and in good detail.
 When you first look at the price of a digital camera it may scare you.  Although when you figure in the cost of a good 35mm camera plus film and developing it is very easy to recognize the benefits of going digital.  
 We took 160 pictures in the first week alone with this camera and that is only the ones we decided to keep.  No more undeveloped film laying around for years and years.
 If you are a snap happy person I would recommend that you run out and buy this camera right now!  Don't wait, hurry up and get it fast.  I assure you that you will not regret it.
