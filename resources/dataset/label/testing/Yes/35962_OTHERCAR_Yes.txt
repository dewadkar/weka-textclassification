            The 1999 Honda Civic LX edition is a wonderful car.  Whether it is for the teen who just got his/her license or the Mother with three children the Civic performs absolutely amazingly.  The newer Civics have increased in size dramatically over the past few years.  They are no longer for two or maybe three people but they can now fit five comfortably.  The back seat is extremely spacious.  The front seats have plenty of room to stretch out your legs.  The car is wonderful.  Not only is the Civic roomy but it also has a great engine inside of it.  Although it is only a four cylinder, the Civic has a great acceleration and can easily surpass one-hundred miles per hour.  Overall, the Honda Civic makes for an great driving experience.  The way it handles, feels, and looks all work to it's advantage and place it at the top of the list when looking for a new car today.<br><br>
