            I've been a member of the Audi World Forum for about 4 months now.  I've seen almost every complaint and praise about this car.  Most all are praises, but I'll mention the negative ones first. 

The main negative about this car seems to be the Diverter Valve problem.  Most people have bought the Bailey Value for a replacement and have been very happy.  Some other complaints are about the wait to buy a TT.  I  ordered an Amulet Red 2001 225hp Coupe in September, and it should be ready in January.  The average wait is about 4 months, and most everyone has had to pay MSRP or a tad bit higher.  

The wait is sure worth it though, because this car is a definite head turner.  People on the forum mention all the time about how people stop them and comment on how lovely their car is and how unique it is from all other cars.   There aren't too many out on the road, and with beautiful colors such as the Amulet and Lake Silver, these cars always turn heads.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who can afford around $40,000.<br><br>
