            My dad purchased a Saab 9-5 SE in March of 1999.  When we first had it, my mom and dad really enjoyed it because it was so much different than any of the other cars we have owned.  When I got my license, it was a quick car for a 16 year old to drive.  Ours is equipped with the 3.0 liter 200 hp turbocharged V-6 that scoots from 0-60 in about 7 something seconds.  It is awesome.  The S button for sport on the shifter makes me feel like I'm driving a sports car, not a sedan.  It has excellent pickup and handles well in snow, too(the Winter button is a good feature) I would say my favorite part is the Harman/Kardon 9 speaker, 200 watt sound system.  IT IS AMAZING!   It sounds like the shelf system in my room!  The heated seats work well in below freezing temps, and the gas mileage is good.  Also, there is good legroom in the rear seats, enough room for two 6'4 men.     <br><br>
