            My husband and I looked at all the minivans available.  At first, we balked at the thought of a Safari, citing the clunky, old-style exterior as a major deterrent.  Finally, a friend convinced us to take a test drive, and I'm so glad she did!

The outside may leave a little bit to be desired, but the inside is wonderful!  A much larger interior than minivans, better cup holders, well thought out interior light placement, and great amenities such as rear air conditioning for much lower prices than the minivan competitors.  Some drawbacks to the interior are the small footwells for the front passengers, but my husband is 6'3, and while he occasionally complains about it, he says it's much better than most cars, and the headroom that he has makes up for it.

I really like the rear wheel drive, and the &quot;truck&quot; feel to driving it.  It did take some getting used to, but I think it drives much sturdier than minivans built on a car chassis.  It has a better turning radius than our Nissan Altima, and is much easier to parallel park too!

One word of warning - make sure to have your tires rotated often, every 5,000-6,000 miles.  The way the front end sits on the front tires makes them wear much faster than the rear ones.  We ended up having to have our tires replaced at 24,000 miles, a rather large expense when you are dealing with truck tires.  We've since put 20,000 miles on our new set of tires, but with the rotations done every 5,000 miles, they are on track to last much longer.

After 18 months, and 44,000 miles, we are still every bit as in love with our Safari as the day we bought it.  I recommend this van to anyone in the market for a minivan.  Just go test drive it.  You won't be disappointed!!<br><br>
