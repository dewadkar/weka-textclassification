            The car of the future has arrived. The Toyota Prius is a hybrid car, running on both electricity and gasoline. With the price of gasoline skyrocketing, this car has been released at the perfect time. 

In comparison to other Toyotas, the Prius most closely resembles the Echo, although it's not as tall and doesn't have that look of being off-balance that the Echo has. The Echo took a lot of knocks for its appearance, so I am interested to hear opinions on the Prius. I think it's a much more attractive car, likely to appeal to a larger group of buyers.

When you climb into the Prius, you will find it comfortable and roomy, with plenty of leg room. The first thing that caught my attention was the screen in the center of the dashboard. When you turn the car on, a Toyota logo appears on the screen. If you let the car idle for a couple of seconds, you may forget whether you have started it or not. While idling, the car is running on electricity, and it is completely silent, not even a hum. 

Once you start to actually move the vehicle, the Toyota logo will disappear from the screen and you will see something resembling a flow chart. This screen allows you to monitor the energy consumption of the vehicle. You will be able to see when the Prius is using electricity, and when it is using gasoline. Just be careful, you may be so interested in watching the screen, you can run the car up a tree! 

One thing that always detracted from the benefits of owning an electric car was the lack of practicality. You can only go a couple hundred miles between battery chargings and the charging stations are few and far between. The Prius has overcome these obstacles with its system. The batteries on the Prius never need to be recharged by an outside charging system. The vehicle recharges the batteries automatically using a &quot;regenerative braking system.&quot; This means that while you are braking or coasting, the Prius takes the energy that is normally lost in this process, and converts it into electricity.

Depending on driving conditions, such as stop and go traffic or higher speed freeway driving, the control unit in the Prius makes the decision on whether to use electric or gas power, or both together. When idling at a stop light or sitting in rush hour traffic, the Prius can run completely on electric power, instead of wasting your gasoline and polluting the air. This is a great benefit to commuters, think of the money you can save on gasoline, especially with the cost of gas right now. 

The car handles very well. It doesn't feel any different than driving a Corolla or other conventional gasoline vehicle. The one exception to this is the slight &quot;kick&quot; you may feel when the vehicle is switching between the motor and the engine. It's noticeable, but not jarring. It can also reach the same highway speeds as regular cars. The top speed of the Prius is 105 mph. When will you ever need to go that fast?

The Prius is not a luxury car. It will not replace your Mercedes or Lexus. However, it could serve an important purpose in our world. More and more people are commuting long distances to work, causing a lot of air pollution. Driving one of these new hybrid cars can help prevent the air from becoming even worse than it already is. It also helps in conserving gasoline. The fuel efficiency is as follows:

52 mpg city
45 mpg highway
48 mpg combined

The gas mileage is better in city driving, because as mentioned earlier, during stop and go driving, the vehicle is run mostly on electricity. These are pretty impressive numbers in my opinion. The Prius has an 11.8 gallon fuel tank. If you do the math, you can go up to 613 miles on one gallon of gas. If you are driving on the highway, you can go over 500 miles on one tank. 

If you are a commute driver, or if you simply want to help make Earth a cleaner place, you may want to consider taking one of these for a test drive. If nothing else, you know the Prius will be a conversation starter. <br><br>
