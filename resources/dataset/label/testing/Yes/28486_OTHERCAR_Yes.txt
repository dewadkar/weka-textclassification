            I purchased my GMC Envoy XLS in February 2002. It is the XLS trim with running boards, AM/FM Stereo Cassette/CD, Content Theft Alarm, Rear Locking Differential and power passenger seat.  Since I've had it I've grown fond of the way the V6 performs like a V8.  Although I thought that the cloth material could be better, the overall fit and finish in the interior is great.  Nice extras include the OnStar system at no extra cost as well as great 17" Michelin Cross Terrain SUV tires.  As other reviewers have indicated a fifth gear on the transmission could have help boost gas mileage.  The best that I've managed to achieve in combined City and Highway driving was around 19 miles/gallon.  I track it following each fill up and I am averaging around 15 miles/gallon.  If I could change one thing it would be the way that the seat belts are designed.  The unit is built into to front bucket seats and it is very uncomfortable when used on long trips.

The stereo system sounds great (and I didn't get the Bose upgrade) with nice extras such as a radio data signal receiver.  Overall I would have to say that I am very satisfied despite the fuel economy and seat belt issues.
