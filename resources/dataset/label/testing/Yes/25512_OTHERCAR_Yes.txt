            We bought our 1994 B3000 4X2 pickup at the end of the season.

At the present time it has just a whisker under 110,000 miles on it and still running like a top.  We live in a high traffic (high accident!) area of Central Florida, and I love being up high enough to see what's going on ahead of me!  I feel so much safer since I started driving the truck about two and half years ago.

We have the extended cab, so I can &quot;tote&quot; my grandchildren! I love that!

Also I am an avid gardener and decorator, so the pickup part is great for hauling all my favorite things home from the store!

At the moment, we are in a bit of a quandry whether to get a new pickup or an SUV when this truck is paid off--NO I will not part with my little green truck!<br><br>
