            After looking for at new cars for a few weeks, I finally settled on a 300M.

This is a considerably smaller car for me. I had been driving a 1998 Ford Explorer for about two years. It's a real change of pace.

There were a couple of things I really liked about the 300M. The first is that it is a complete car. There are almost no options on the car - it comes with everything. The second was the price. I was able to get it with every option available for $30,000.

In driving the car, I find that it is really fast. I can drive the heck out of it, and not realize how fast I am going. It feels very stable and solid, and handles nimbly at high speeds. The car is also very comfortable, and more roomy than my Explorer. I put my 6'4&quot; cousin in the back seat on a trip to the store, and he was fine. I can't wait to take it on a road trip!

I do have a couple of complaints about the car, though. The interior design guys left something out. The majority of people in the 300M's target market are going to have three things every time they get into the car: a cell phone, a pair of sunglasses, and a cardkey to get into the parking garage at the office (maybe two out of three). There are no convenient places to put these. I have to put them in the glove box, or in the map holder. Not fun when the phone is ringing...

The other complaint is the relatively small gas tank. I live in Los Angeles and I believe that every car should be able to take you from the beach to the Las Vegas strip on one tank. I was able to do that with my Explorer, but the 300M will only get me to the Nevada state line. A couple of extra gallons of gas would be great.

That being said, I've had the 300M for a month now, and normally I suffer from buyer's remorse from a purchase like this, but I feel really good about my choice.<br><br>
