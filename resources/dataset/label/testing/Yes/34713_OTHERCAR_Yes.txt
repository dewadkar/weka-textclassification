            The MPV is a terrific minivan.  My family has had one for about 8 years and my uncle recent bought one last year.
Ours is the old three door one.  I love it.  It has a very roomy interior.  The control console is well designed and easy to reach. The standard sound system is pretty good! And the second air condition controls for the back seats is a practical feature. But the best thing about the MPV is how well it rides and drives.  As a passenger, the MPV makes for a smooth ride.  AS a driver, the car does not even feel like a minivan.  It handles extremely well.  I'm a pretty rough driver and i swear, the MPV handles like no other minivan-lot of power,  terrific acceleration and sensitive brakes.  The steering is responsive and the car is sensitive to slight turns.  The newer models are even better because they have four doors, for added convenience.  The seats are arranged alittle differently.( I prefer the older arrangement. )
I'd recommend this for people for travel or camp or need lots of storage space and for families of 4 or more.<br><br>
