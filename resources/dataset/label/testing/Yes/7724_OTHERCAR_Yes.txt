            The Opinion:

My first car was a 1991 Plymouth Sundance America Hatchback 4 door.  Probably the most basic and least exciting of all Sundances.  It had no options.  I have been driving it for three years.  My parents and I put every one of the 145,000 miles on it.  It has never broken down and has required very little in major repairs other than a couple of computer problems.  It still has the original clutch!  It has been very practical for me.  It can be parked almost anywhere being small and having a VERY good turning radius.  It has excellent fuel economy and costs very little in the way of repairs.  And I enjoy driving it.  With the 5-speed it accelerates very nicely, although it is fairly easy to spin the tires (or should I say tire, no limited-slip differential) if I am not careful, especially in wet conditions.  I can easily keep up with rush hour traffic and pass slow moving vehicles on country highways.  And I recently got 35 mpg on a highway trip of about 300 miles.  All and all an excellent and reliable car that I will probably have for many years to come.  And adding options like cruise control and delay wipers is very inexpensive. 

The Facts:

Engines (in order of power):  The base engine on most Sundance/Shadows is the 2.2L TBI (fuel injected) Inline-4.  This engine produces a modest 93hp@4800rpm.  It produces, however, a respectable 121 ft/lbs of torque at a mere 3200rpm.  This low end torque contributes to every day drivability and reduces the need to downshift to accelerate (or to go up hills on the highway).

The second engine is the only slightly different 2.5L 4 TBI producing slightly more power and torque (100hp@4800rpm and 135ft/lbs@2800rpm).  With smoother operations it is perhaps a more drivable engine, although not as capable of high performance (the 2.2 had a IROC turbo III with 224hp).  Better low end torque with not quite as much upper end.

The third would be the V-6 with 141hp and 171ft/lbs which was quite a lot of power in the 2600lb Sundance/Shadow

Next is the 2.2L Turbo-I.  This engine had the advantage of multi-port fuel injection.  It produced 142hp with better gas-mileage than the V-6.

More common in the Sundance is the 2.5L Turbo with 150hp.

The four cylinders ran about 27/33 for mileage (EPA).  The turbos could give better mileage if you keep your foot out of the turbo (yeah right) or worse if you don't (more likely).  The V-6 ran about 20/25.  The reliability of the 4s is debatable.  I have found it to be good, some have needed somewhat frequent head-gasket replacement.  Most common cause of breakdown is timing belt breakage which is not serious and will not damage the engine (it can damage certain types of engines, but not this one).

All of the engines, even the 2.2 TBI, are very drivable with a 5-speed.  With the auto I would recommend the V-6 or one of the turbos as the TBIs can be sluggish.

Handling:

This car performs well in this category (even at the track) if you replace the stock tires with good ones.  The car corners easily, swerves quickly, and is quite agile.  A good stiff suspension and good weight distribution contributes to this.  Skidpad is around .80g depending on the model and tire (different models had different wheel sizes).  For comparison sports cars typically range from about .85 to 1.00 while SUVs typically live around .70.  Ground clearance is also good so you are very unlikely to bottom this car out, much less so than similar cars of different makes.

Ride:

A side affect of a nice stiff suspension is of course a rough ride.  Expect a slightly better ride than an Escort, Corolla, or Civic due to the Sundance's higher weight.  I have taken very long trips in this car, but it does tend to be a bit rough.  You can definitely feel the road.  Unfortunately the aerodynamic styling of the car does not mean it is aerodynamic.  With a drag coefficient of .42 it is amazing that highway mileage is as good as it is.  This means that there is a lot of wind noise at highway speeds.

Transmission:

The 5-speed had good gear ratios and was virtually maintenance free (other than changing the fluid).  The clutch could be A LOT smoother, but it improves over time.  The automatic has smooth, predictable shifting and was good for both around town driving and highway driving.  It didn't offer much in the way of performance however.

Interior:

The seats are reasonably comfortable although the back is fairly small.  The instruments are easy to read and well placed.  It would be nice if the base cars had tachometers, especially with the 5-sp.  The stock radio controls are ok, Chrysler hasn't improved them much since.  There is TONS of cargo room.  The hatchback design and the folding rear seat mean that this car can haul tons of stuff relative to its size.  Far more than a Neon or Civic.

Exterior:

The exterior is pleasant but unexciting.  It does look aerodynamic (even though it isn't).  The paint does seem to chip if you look cross-eyed at it, I always wish they made a bra for it.  Headlights illuminate well if not exceptionally.<br><br>
