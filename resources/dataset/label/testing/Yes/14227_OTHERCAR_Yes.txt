            I bought the QV2000 with the IBM 340MB Microdrive 07/2000 and I'm pretty happy with it. It's easy to use, everyone remarks about how great the images come out, the software loaded up with no problems and is great for previewing the images, and the USB interface is &quot;da bomb.&quot; I purchased it for $764 and have found it for as little as $460 with the standard 8MB memory stick.

Continuous advance means 6 shots at highest rez, 1 every half second. It has multiple flash modes, picture-taking modes, etc. Like any other digital camera that uses standard batteries it runs out of juice quick--especially with the Microdrive. I recommend you go buy EIGHT AA NiMH batteries (it takes four at a time) and a one-hour recharger and keep 4 fully charged batteries on hand at all times. The best $40 dollar investment for this camera.

The one downfall of this camera is its ability to take AVI movies. If you don't read the information from CASIO correctly, you may think that by purchasing the 340MB Microdrive you can record up to 19 minutes of video. And they're right--38 sets of 30-second clips; not 19 consecutive minutes. After a call to Customer Service at Casio I understood the &quot;Why?&quot; but still stated that I thought the information was misleading.

Also the information says nothing about sound recording--that's because there isn't any. If you're looking for that feature to go along with movie taking, you've come to the wrong camera. O.K., O.K. the camera didn't cost me $1000, but video without audio?

Nonetheless, this camera has some distinct advantages over the competition and I am happy with the primary function--taking really nice pics.<br><br>
