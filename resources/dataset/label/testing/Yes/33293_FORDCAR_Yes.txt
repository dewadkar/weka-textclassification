                I picked up my 2002 Ford Focus SE Comfort sedan with Zetec engine, automatic transmission, side airbags, 6-disc CD, power moonroof and ABS yesterday. I searched high and low for an inexpensive first new car, and I was very impressed with the quality I received for my money. Other cars looked and felt cheap, and cost considerably more. 
    The interior of the car is roomy and the seats are very comfortable, unlike the Escort I recently drove. My seats car go up and down as well as forward and backward, and the steering wheel tilts AND telescopes for optimal safety and driving comfort. Even the seats in the backseat are much nicer than I expected. All controls are in easy reach and are reasonable simple to use. The models with the tach on the dash make the display seem too crowded, going without it creates an easy-to-read and interpret dash. 
    The exterior design is classy enough for an adult yet still fun for 20-somethings. The lines are sweeping and it is one of the most unique designs on the road. The trunk is larger than it looks from outside and can carry quite a large load. The 60/40 rear seats fold down to accomodate longer items. 
    The engine is a peppy 130 hp, 16 valve 4-cylinder. It easily takes the car down the road and driving is hardly work. It is neither under nor overpowered. I personally would prefer a touch more power, but the engine definitely works for this car. I would NOT suggest getting the standard engine. 
    This car is MUCH nicer than the Hyundai Elantra I recently rented for a week, and they both had the same options. More comfortable and an easier drive.
