            I needed a vehicle that was safe enough to hold my own against the Monster Assault Vehicles yet compact enough to maneuver into small campus parking spaces.  With Honda's solid background in quality and dependability, this was an easy choice.  I purchased a 2000 black CR-V and could not be happier with it.  Please consider the CR-V in your SUV shopping, for you will be pleasantly surprised.

The CR-V was by far the quietest SUV I drove.  Forget the Xterra, Passport, and Rodeo.  I drove them all and could not believe the difference in cabin quietude.

Inside cabin room is *surprisingly* spacious, not at all claustrophobic like the Isuzu Rodeo or Honda Passport.  Four passengers sit very comfortably and all usually express surprise at the amount of room they have.

There are only 2 negative things I can find to say about the CR-V and every other CR-V owner with whom I have spoken have the same complaints:

1. If you're looking for fast acceleration and quick starts, look elsewhere.  It's like that ad for the VW Bug:  &quot;0-60? Yes.&quot;
2. Upgrade the stereo system if sound and music are at all important to you while you drive.
