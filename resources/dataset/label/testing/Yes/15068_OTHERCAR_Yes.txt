            I own an FD83, my father owns an fd73.   As much as I love his camera, mine is significantly nicer and I would not hesitate to recommend that people look at the 83 over the 73 for the relatively small price difference.  It has more modes to shoot in.  The most important difference is movie mode.  When I was deciding which camera to pucrhase, the movie mode was not a large factor in my decision, but I actually use it all the time.  It comes in very handy for events which occur in daily life that you would like to have video of.  The videos and pictures can be played on any computer.  I recommend the 83 over the 73 because of the movie mode and the small price difference.<br><br>
