               My wife was not to happy with the twenty seven miles to the gallon her 1999 Honda Accord was getting so we went looking for something that would get her much better mileage without sacrificing comfort.
   We had owned a Honda Civic VX that was great on gas and about the MOST uncomfortable small car we had ever driven so I had my work cut out for me.
   After trying out many small cars ,I (sort of as a joke) hopped into a black two-door Echo with a five speed transmission.
   Wow,what seats!
   This car had just about the perfect ergonomics for me and my wife.
   We are not small people and this car sat us up off the floor and had seats that did not 'cup' our backs into a groove in the seat.
   All of the controls made sense and were easy to reach and use.
   It has a wacky center placed speedometer that took some getting used too but now I like it BETTER than ALL THE OTHERS HIDDEN behind the steering wheel.
   Performance wise,the four cylinder motor did'nt bog down when the a/c was turned on and the car actually moves down the road pretty nicely.
   The only real flaw in this car is the side to side handling.
   Toyota recommends thirty to thirty two pounds of pressure in the stock tires.
   Well,at that pressure the car is frightening.
   In lane changes it leans over and plows it's tires like your drunk,best friend walking through the aisle of your favorite bar.
   Not a good thing.
   But raise the tire pressure a few pounds and this annoying habit is greatly reduced and the car becomes much more drivable.
   With the stock tires,Bridgestone RE92's.I could drive the s*#t out of this car and STILL get 40 miles per gallon.
   Around fourty thousand miles it became time to change tires so I bought MUCH CHEAPER B.F.Goodrich T.A.'s and promptly lost three miles per gallon.
   Ironically, these tires drove slightly better than the stock 92's.
   Only,if I drive the car easy now will it will return 41 to 43 miles per gallon.
   It usually returns thirty eight ro thirty nine miles per gallon.
   Twice with the old 92's,I got 49mpg!
   Well,this car now has over sixty thousand very hard run miles on it and it has done me NO wrong.
   In the rain,it drives well.
   High wind will move it around a little.
   In the snow,well,drive another car,it don't like snow or maybe I simply expect to much 'snowability' from an under two thousand pound car.
   The stock cd-cassette-am-fm radio sounds good enough to keep in the car.
   If your wondering,my wife did'nt like the smallness of the car in traffic so she went back to driving the Accord which we still have.
   I don't have that problem.
   I grew up driving the crap out of Pinto's,four cylinder Mustangs and VW Beetles.
   There is another characteristic about this car I have to mention.
   The crazy thing about the Echo is that it is so unique that you really can't help but smile when you see it.
   The mojo outside of the car carries over inside so that much more than the Accord,when my wife and I are in it,we're smiling and laughing much more.
   I don't know what it is but I like it.
   It's a great car for sightseeing because of the large windows in it.
   One last thing about the motor in the Echo.
   This four cylinder has an upper powerband that most drivers of the car will NEVER USE.
   I do pretty much use it everyday.
   Merging onto the local interstate,you get into that powerband and this little car MOVES OUT!
   I OWN THE CAR and I'll probably buy another one because they don't hold their resale value well.
   I'll find one for around five grand with under a hundred thou on it and because of it's Toyota durability drive it another hundred thousand miles.
   So if you buy a car to make up for your smallness of 'character',go get a Hummer but if you like to save money everytime you crank up your car and have enough backbone to drive a great small car,you owe it to yourself to check out the Toyota Echo.
   The newest models have been redesigned on the outside so that they are even better looking cars. 
************************************************************
   Update:72000 miles-motor still runs well-I'm getting a consistent 39 mpg with intermittent 42 mpg tankfuls.
   I replaced the manual transmission fluid with 75w90 Pennzoil synthetic fluid about 10,000 miles ago.
   It's helped a little with me missing shifts(which I think is more me than the car).
   It gets much better mileage on the cheapest,rattiest econobrand regular gas than on Exxon premium gas.
   I'm most likely keeping this car past 110,000 miles,which is the longest I would take any non-self adjusting valve car before getting service.
   I'll probably do the adjustment myself-to adjust the valves requires removal of the camshafts to remove adjustment shims.
   Anyone who worked on aircooled Japanese motorcycles is familiar with the shim and bucket valve adjustment design.
   Ye-ha.
   I might just run it till it dies,too.
   I am VERY,VERY DISAPPOINTED in Toyota about this valve adjustment thing.
   It's pretty bad when the service people at the local Toyota just plain tell you that they prefer to NOT do the adjustments because of the cost to you and the disassembly required.
   I own this thing now and,without valve adjustments,if I'm lucky the valvetrain should last around 130,000 to 150,000 miles but it will probably fail Virginia's emissions tests long before then.
   It ain't my Echo's fault,it's Toyota's.
