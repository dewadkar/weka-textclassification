            I purchased my 1997 Stratus in December of 1998 with 42,000 miles. Within one week of the purchase my stratus was back at the dealership with a blown head gasket. I later found out that a dodge stratus is very prone to have gasket failure. 
However, since then the only problem that I have had was a bad oxygen sensor which cost me $192 to replace. 
I am 6'3&quot; and this vehicle has more than enough room for me both in the front and rear seats. I set the front seat as far back as it goes and then sat behind it with plenty of room to spare. This is a great car for someone who is looking for a roomy and economical mode of transportation. 
I am still averaging 30mpg highway and that is at an average speed of 70mph with the A/C on. 
The one drawback that I see on this particular vehicle is that it does not hold its value very well. Blue book value on a 1997 Stratus is $4300 in good condition. 
If you are looking for a dependable, roomy and economical car then this is one that you should seriously consider. <br><br>
