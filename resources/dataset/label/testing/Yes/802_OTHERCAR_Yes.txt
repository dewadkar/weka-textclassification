            Yes, it's rated as a luxury car, and yes it cost more than $35,000, but this vehicle packs a lot of practicality into a mid-size station wagon.

The safety features are top quality. Two front airbags along with side impact pillows, and the well-known Volvo steel cage make for a safe ride. A built it toddler seat in the middle of the backseat provides far more safety than standard carseats.

We had a 2-passenger seat installed in the far rear of the car. Weight tested for about 160 pounds, this has comfortably accommodated our two youngest children, endless bags of groceries, and weekly camping supplies for three seasons.

The leather interior is easy to clean, and definitely adds to the luxurious style. The seat warmer is a big plus for me during the cold New Hampshire winters.

My teenagers are insanely jealous over the quality of the CD player, which was standard with this model. 

The straight 6 engine is powerful. I'm definitely not into speeding down the highway, but like knowing I have the power to get out of the way--fast--if need be!

Aesthetically speaking, I think it's a very attractive car, but that is certainly one of those personal opinions rather than the required factual ones.

The only downfall to this car is the breaks. They have needed replacing twice already, and that seems a bit excessive to me. (I am guilty, however, of riding the breaks &quot;on occasion&quot;.)

I would buy another one of these cars in a heartbeat, but I don't think they make them any more. As our family downsizes with two off in college now, I may in fact be ready to give up a station wagon and opt for a sedan. 

And those new Volvo S80's are sleek!<br><br>
