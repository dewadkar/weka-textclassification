            When your wife or other loved one gets in a severe accident, you really start rethinking what kind of car you want them to drive.  We decided to buy a '95 850 Turbo (with 35,000 miles on the odo) after my wife was in a severe accident last year and have to say that we made a great choice.  This car is an excellent combination of safety and sporting fun.  We considered used Audi's, Bimmers and various other vehicles, but the 850 stood above the rest in all aspects, including retention of value.

This is one heck of a fun car!  Some may pooh-pooh the staid nature of Volvos in general, but this car will blow them away.  The 850 Turbo has what consider a safe level of power and acceleration at the minimum, but has the ability to ruffle a few feathers on the highway with its neck-snapping acceleration.  The 5-cylinder engine in this car is a Porsche-Volvo co-design (according to the dealer) which was designed for 300+ HP but is limited to a respectable 225.  Thus, you get a very bulletproof engine which does more than enough to scoot you out of a potentially hazardous situation.  The great power and speed on instant demand are only part of the story though.

All this power and smooth acceleration are couched in practicality and safety.  The safety of our 850 is unmatched due to weight, structural design and features.  In case you didn't know, Volvo invented the three-point seat belt (on all four seats in this vehicle), pioneered the use of airbags and is largely instrumental in the proliferation of side-protection systems in higher-end vehicles now on the market.  This car has them all, including excellent stopping power with 4-wheel ABS.  Coupled with traction control and very solid feel (most likely due to the hefty weight of this vehicle), all these features give my wife a great sense of security (combined with her excellent driving habits)while driving.

We love the practicality as well.  It's easy to haul around 3-4 passengers.  And the trunk can easily accommodate a few golf bags or groceries in the back (in that order of priority).  And mileage is pretty good too.  We averaged about 23 MPG on a 800 mile trip to Central Oregon and back fully loaded with luggage and bicycles.  Around town, we average about 21 mpg.

Comforts and conveniences make this a great car to drive.  My 850 has it all: 200W stereo, heated seats, power memory seat on the drivers side and sunroof.  We both love to drive this car.  Since my wife drives it primarily, I can't wait to get my paws on the wheel whenever I get the chance.  Whether on short jumps to the grocery store or on a long jaunt to Central Oregon, this car is a joy to drive.  You feel just the right sense of control and power, the ride is generally quiet (even with sunroof open) and I feel just fine driving long distances without stopping (much to my wife's frustration).

Volvo has split the difference with handling on this vehicle.  The tires and suspension are both designed to be on the sporty side (tight and responsive) without feeling like you are driving on a bumpy dirt road.  The handling is fairly tight with minimal body roll (amazing given the weight of the car).  If I were to say one thing negative about this car, though, it that it doesn't have some kind of variable suspension system, allowing you to adjust ride firmness from inside the car.  As it stands, the car is pretty harsh on rutted or washboard roads, but smooth as silk pretty much the rest of the time.  I think an upgrade to a set of Bilstein shocks and some new rubber is forthcoming for me to make up for the ride comfort compromises Volvo built into this car.

The bottom line?  Buy this car if want excellent stealth power combined with impeccable safety features and great usability.  Do not buy it if you are a lead foot, lest you give in to temptation and get corralled by the cops.  In this car, it is very easy to go very fast very quickly, to the point of even surprising yourself.  This temptation was a small price to pay though for a great car that we'll own for quite a few years to come.<br><br>
