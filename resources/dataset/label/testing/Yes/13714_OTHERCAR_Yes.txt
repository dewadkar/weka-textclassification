            Well once again Cadallic has not let us down with power and car design all mixed together in a pot of luxury.  With thier state of the art Northstar system that Front wheel drive luxurious monster is capable of 300 hp!  It has GPS full leather interior moveable seats in almost every direction. Electric everything.. And yes that includes those convenient little pop up head light cleaners which we we all love so much.  This is one of the more &quot;power luxury&quot; cars out there in the luxury class.  Its powerful engine is however reduced by the front wheel drive.  But none the less still one mean machine.  I recommend this to anyone who has the money to afford it.<br><br>
