            I can't say much about this car (because I don't have one) but when my friend (Steve) bought a bmw 318i I had to go for a run in it,  BMW has always been a favoured brand with every one I know, this car responds extremely well, excellent handling, I have even done tight corners at over 65 km/h and the car felt excellent and was very fun to drive.
Easy to maintain, with it's great gas mileage, easy ability to park, and of course easy to feel safe in. 
At $8,500 this was excellent buy (Steve is guaranteed to drive passed my house at least four times a week taunting me because I don't have one), being very comfortable you could live in this car, it runs like a dream, very quite, Roomy in the front and back.
