                 The camera is great! I couldn't handle the swivel of the 950 or the new 990. One of the reasons why I decided to go with this camera. Has quite a few manual features for focusing and exposure.( There is no shutter control =~( ) I've used this camera in all lighting (worst in midday central park) so far the auto expose feature is accurate! Usually i get a over exposed shot from my N60. Good flexible software controls the OSD is quiet easy to navigate. As well as the play mode with the filing options are quite east to make create and index the photos I've taken.(80meg card = 300+ shots @ basic mode) Nikons have the best optional accessories around. I picked up the ac adapter wide angle lens rechargeables (Kodak brand NiMH) 80MB CF memory card and a Microtech USB card reader. There are also additonal HIGHER capacity CF cards as well as a telephoto lens and fisheye lens(for those interlaced 360degree photos). I haven't gotten it yet but the CoolPack is a must! the UV lens filter is included in that pack *something I'm tryin to get* I've tried and tested many digital cameras already the Nikon by far has been the easiest to really just start up and take shots out of the box. The provided software is mediocre ( I wouldn't load that viewer ) Apple Mac Compatible (through 8 pin serial) In short one of the best buys on the market.<br><br>
