            My husband and I finally got a Jeep! We're both into the whole Jeep scene and love to work on cars together. So when we got the opportunity to get the Jeep, we jumped at it. We got the 5.2 V-8 with 4 all the time. We knew that it was going to have to have some upgrades...cause that's the way we are. But the great thing about the Jeep is that the after-market is screaming with all sorts of great upgrades!
 
For as old as the Jeep is, the ride is incredible. The suspension is still kickin. The engine runs like a champ and we have never had any problems with it. (No leaks or massive oil consumption). The tranny is still in great shape, too. 
We did have to change a few wear-items out, which is expected when you get an older used vehicle. We changed the fuel pump and radiator (not because there was anything wrong with the radiator, but because with the towing package we have, the 1 row radiator was not a good thing so we got a 3 row, which dropped the temp almost 20 degrees).
Jeeps were built for durability and reliability...and so far, I have had both! It's the best vehicle I have ever had and it's great for road trips.
We are planning to kick her up a few notches. She already had a Flowmaster American Thunder exhaust...and she rumbles like a champ. We are getting Edlebrock high performance shocks and a SkyJacker lift (probably at least 3 inches), also a high performance air box and TBI. She's going to scream. If you ever watch Trucks...you'll know where we get all our ideas. 
Overall...great vehicle for a great price. Lots of possibilities and miles of fun!!! I recommend this vehicle to anyone who asks!
