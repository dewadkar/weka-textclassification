            I purchased my 2000 Pontiac Bonneville SE after 5 years in my 1994 V8 T-Bird.  I loved my Bird, but constant mechanical repairs (and a new baby) made it impractical to keep the car.

In looking for a sedan, my priorities included a sporty &amp; distinctive character, safety, room, value and reliability.  I think that the Pontiac, with proven mechanicals and a strong, stiff chassis, fulfilled the criteria I was looking for.

The car handles very nicely and I feel confident driving it in all types of weather conditions.  The V6 offers plenty of power, with abundant torque at the low end.  The tranny is a pleasure with smooth, positive shifts and excellent drivability.

As a people hauler, the car has plenty of room, both front and back.  The trunk is huge!  The baby seat fits nicely, and I appreciate the handy built-in tethers.

Pet-peeves: my cloth seats are not all that comfortable.  I bought a lumbar cushion though, and that solved the problem for me.  Also, the steering circle is wider than I expected.  My wife's 98 Sable, which is only 3 inches shorter, has a much sharper turning radius.

Overall though, I am very pleased with the car.  I recommend it as a pleasurable yet sporty sedan.  Nice job, Pontiac.<br><br>
