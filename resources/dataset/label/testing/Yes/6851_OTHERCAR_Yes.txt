            I really didn't want a Hyundai.

 My old car died and I was looking for a reasonably priced and reliable used car. My wife and I stopped into a Mazda/Hyundai dealership to look at their used car lot. On the way in she pointed at a car and said, "I love that one". It was a 1999 Elantra. I reminded her that we didn't have a lot of money to spend, and almost had to drag her into the used car lot.

We found three 1996 Mitsubishi Galants with an average of 30,000 miles which were priced at about $12,000. The salesman came by and told me that he could get me a new car for about the same price...the Elantra. I told him that I really didn't want a Hyundai. My wife and the salesman joined forces and wore my resistance down. To humor them both, I let the salesman show me the Elantra.

 Well I liked the car, but it was a Hyundai. I decided that to avoid further pressure from the salesman and my wife, I would add so many options that the car would be well beyond what we could afford.

The car came with air conditioning, power steering, brakes, windows, and locks, cruise control, tilt steering, AM/FM stereo, a 5-speed manual, and a lot more. I added an automatic transmission, six speaker sound system with CD player (100 watt), alloy wheels, spoiler, remote keyless entry, alarm system, and a tilting/sliding moonroof. The car came in at about $15,000 including tax.

Well, I bought the Hyundai and it was the best decision I've made in years. I've had it for a year, and put about 10,500 miles on it, and to this day I get a smile on my face every time I get behind the wheel.

The car has a solid feel to it unlike a Saturn that I drove that felt rather tinny and loose. The 140hp engine provides excellent acceleration, and the handling is sporty with a good feel for the road. The car is roomy enough for a family of four average size people. (I'm 5' 11" and about 180 lbs....that's what I consider average.) Note that a six way adjustable (not power) driver's seat with adjustable lumbar support is standard.

 The ride is pretty good for a small car. No car this size is going to give you a boulevard ride, but this car seems to have a reasonable balance between ride and handling. Gas mileage started off poor (about 15.5 mpg in the city) but has been steadily improving (now 20 mpg in the city) as I've put on miles.

The only problem I've had so far was a broken interior door handle which my dealer fixed without charge.

This car is solid, roomy, reliable, attractive, and best of all, fun to drive, even after a year. Test drive it and you'll probably buy it (as my wife still reminds me to this day).

You won't be sorry.

Anyone reading this deserves an update on this car after two years and about 28,000 miles.

Three problems.

First, a leaky transmission oil pan. Fixed at no charge under the warranty.

Next, the front brakes (rotors and all) wore out at about 24,000 miles. I do mostly city driving and drive the car pretty hard, so it didn't seem unreasonable. 

Last, original bulbs and fuses must have been pretty cheap. Replaced quite a few at my own expense. They're all inexpensive, so it didn't amount to much, but it was still a pain in the behind to have to do it.

Other than that, the car is everything I could ask for. Still spirited and nimble-handling. Still fun to drive. I've heard horror stories about the paint not holding up on older versions of this car, but with a wash and a wax the car looks as good as the day I drove it out of the dealership.

City gas mileage is not the 24 mpg that it's supposed to get. 20 mpg is more like it. Highway mileage is impressive though. You can cruise forever at 60 mph on a tank of gas.

I still recommend it. Very much so.
