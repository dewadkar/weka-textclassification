            We have been owners of a Camry for about 10 years now, and each year they seem to get better and better.  The release of the new body style 2002 Camry has spiced up things from the previous models.  The 2002 Camry is starting to aim at a younger crowd with its sleeker, sportier design.  With the availability of the 2002 Camry SE V6 such add ons as a spoiler, sun/moon-roof, suspension and sway bar are added to give it a more sporty handle and feel.  Others may opt for the XLE which is the most luxurious model with such options as DVD in dash GPS system etc.  Whatever price range fits your needs, every Camry is 100% authentic Toyota feeling:  Smooth, dependable, powerful and quit.

Performance:

Being an owner of a 2002 Camry SE V6 brings a differant feeling to driving a 4 door sedan.  With the differant sportier suspension the car feels stiffer, also making the ride a little more rough which may be a determining factor in choosing which Camry is right for you.  With the sway bar added to the front of the car turns can be taken at higher speeds with very little feeling of the car diving into the turns.  The V6 is powerful in the city and performs just as great on the highway.  While the car idles it is barely heard inside the car, which truely is quality Camrys have been known for.  

Comfort:

Passenger and driver seats are very comfortable, especialy if the power adjustable seats are obtained.  The option of dual passenger/driver heated seats makes the cold winter mornings easier to handle on the drive to work.  The back seats are a little stiff and aren't the greates for long trips.  Though such features as back armrest/cup holders and a retractable back window sunshade make driving a little more comfortable in hotter days.

Safety:

I highly suggest going to Toyotas website to view the safety that goes into Toyota brand cars.  With the availability of side curtain airbags make the threat of a side impact collision just a little bit more comforting knowing that your protected a little more.  

Downsides:

The only real downside of the car that must be known is its ability to be controled in bad weather, especialy snow.  I've found myself taking turns in the city at well below safe speeds to find myself going into a sideways slide.  Although the traction control system and skid control kick in, it is still a very hard car to control in bad conditions.
