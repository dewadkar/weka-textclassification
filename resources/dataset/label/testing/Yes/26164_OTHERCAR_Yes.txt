            In year 2000, Consumer Reports gave Sienna's long standing as the #1 minivan to a new comer Honda Odyssey.  However, I feel Sienna is still the best minivan.

<b>WHY SIENNA IS THE BEST</b>
This minivan shares the Camry's platform and mechanical components. The 3.0-liter engine pumps out above-average power for this category and the tire-pressure monitoring system is a neat feature.  It had the best-ever score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's offset crash test.  There's more room to move around inside than most minivans.  As with other Toyotas, the Sienna is assembled like a fine watch.  The Sienna accelerates and passes with the same ease as a Camry.  The automatic climate control works like a charm, keeping the temperature where you want it.  The only fault I found with Sienna is its awkward parking brake, which you press with your foot.
