            This is my second maxima, and i just loved my 1997 GXE,had it for three
years needed no repairs only  oil change etc, so when it was time
there was no doubt that I would get another one, but this time I got the
GLE which was a little more costly but which came with everything, leather seat, cd, heated seats, bose radio seven speakers, sun roof, power
windows and seats etc. It is great plus it drive beautiful a real luxury car as everyone who rides in it says. If anyone is having trouble looking
for a car which is dependable and safe they should go look at the nissan
I love mine and I am sure you will too.<br><br>
