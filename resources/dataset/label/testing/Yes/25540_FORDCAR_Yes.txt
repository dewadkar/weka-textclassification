     I remember my first view of the Ford Explorer SportTrac: I was standing at the dealership, looking around for some kind of new vehicle to get with the money left over from a trade-in: my aging customized Chevy Suburban already sent back to the dealer. I knew I wanted something comfortable, but the Suburbans had just become so much excess to me--Wasted space and doo-dads, all too expensive. I wanted to get something that would be nice and comfortable, but affordable and practicle. I stood there with the sales rep, looking over the autos, when it pulled up into the lot. I wasn't sure *what* to make of it at first--Was it a truck, or a car? It didn't look like anything I'd ever seen before. Someone was just bringing it back in for a test drive, an intresting-looking black model, with gold trim and tan interior. I walked over calmly, the sales rep by my side. He procedded to tell me that this was one of the only ones in the state of Mississippi at this point, and it was already taken by this customer--The test drive had gone well. None-the-less, he let me climb inside, and immiedatly I was taken: The leather interior was comfortable beyond belief, spacious and well-proportioned, even for someone as tall as myself (over 6' tall). Everything was well within reach, and even just sitting there felt like a dream... a dream that, I thought, couldn't be fulfilled because it had already been taken. As though in answer to my desperation, at that precise moment an 18-wheeler pulled up on the lot, packed with cars and trucks of all sizes, shapes, and models.. and one beautiful, white SportTrac sitting right on top. I drove home with it that day. For sheer comfort, you can't beat the SportTrac--Roomy and spacious, the seats feel like a dream come true. You can easily fit four large individuals inside without any problem at all, and the backseat is perfect for the kids. The addititon of a sun-roof inside and sliding rear-window make for great natural air-conditioning on beautiful days. The stereo system is excellent, having awesome sound coming through the speakers, and a 6-disk CD changer. I've never felt a better handling vehicle, nor one that rides any smoother on the road. At first glance, the truck bed itself seems small and unweildy, but thanks to a fold-out bar cage, it's length can actually extend to that of a full-size truck. Though V8 models are slowly becoming available, ours is a V6, though that is really all we need at this point. My only tru complaint about the SportTrac is it's gas usage--It holds only a little over 20 gallons in it's tank, and averages out to be little more than 10.5 miles per gallon--When going on long trips, this can mean spending more than you thought on gas money. Also, Ford seems to be a little behind on accessories--Upon purchase, we were promised a tennau cover for the bed of our truck--It still hasn't been manufactured. Neither has a trailer hitch for flat-beds (which we use in our buisness) and various other things. But, if these don't really matter to you, then ignore them because the SportTrac is such an excellent vehicle I'd reccomend it to anyone reguardless of these small, niggling flaws.<br><br>
