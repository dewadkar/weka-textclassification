            With a baby on the way one of the first things my wife and I went looking for was a new camera. Being the techno-geeks that we are and knowing our own habits though, we decided that it would be best to look into a digital camera. Going by price and features it took some time but we settled for this camera and since then we've not regretted it for a moment!

Certainly the first issue with a digital camera has nothing to do with the model you choose and more with the change in how you use it. The ability to screen any picture you've taken and then immediately delete it if you don't think it looks good is a big plus... I've kept myself from wasting time and space on my memory cards many times by removing clunkers immediately. Another thing you must adjust to is the media types and how this can affect your photo taking. Do you opt for more pictures at lower resolution or do you go with highest resolution and limit the number of pictures you can fit on a card? In terms of Net pictures low resolution is usually acceptable but a word of warning, if you plan on printing any of the photos some day you'll want to go with the highest resolution unless you like all sorts of artifacts and pixellation in your printed photos.

Specifically to the Kodak model in question there are a number of things I've come to appreciate. While some people have seen the digital cameras that accept 3.5&quot; floppy disks and think of pure convenience I must say that route is a big mistake... on that Kodak avoided. With a floppy only holding less than 1 1/2 MBs of data, you'd need a whole slew of them to take a normal film roll's worth of photos. Instead, the Kodak's use a flash card that, while expensive, works very nicely and is easily ported around if you have more than one... which I'd recommend.

If there was any area that is more lacking for the camera I would say it has to do with the touchy quality you can get with it at times. First, be sure never to zoom in too much on something if you want the highest quality pictures. Once you switch to digital zoom the resolution of pictures you take will go down. Not terrible but something to keep in mind, maybe you're best off just moving closer. The biggest factor after that though has to do with lighting. This camera is very sensitive about the amount of light it has and if the pictures are taken when it is too dark you will get a ton of grain in your photos... not a good thing. Another problem area can be if you get too close to an object, you can get blurriness. This requires being up in the macro range of closeness though so not a major issue.

Photo transfer is a snap through a variety of methods and I've found Kodak's site to be updated regularly with new drivers and utilities, a nice plus. Team this bad boy up with a photo printer and you're really in business for yourself though... or if you have a CD burner it is nice to now be able to make your own digital photo albums to save on CD. Overall a great product at an increasingly reasonable price.<br><br>
