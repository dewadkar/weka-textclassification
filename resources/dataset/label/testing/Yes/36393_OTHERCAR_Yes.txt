            I have been driving a friends truck that he just purchased last week.  It was the Dodge Dakota, Quad Cab, Sport Edition.  This is a beautiful vehicle.  I'm actually jealous because I just finished writing an epinion on my own vehicle and realize everything I don't have (but I still love my truck!).  

This is a 4 door quad cab that rides with enough room for passengers to sit comfortably.  It has everything you need for comfort.  AC, Cruise, spacious interior, Infinite speakers with CD stereo sound system, Child proof locking for rear doors, power windows and locking, duel air bags with option to disable, 4X4, and plenty of power to get you where you need to go (5 spd manual).  Rear sliding window for the back passengers.

The highway drive is very smooth and quiet.  It has more power than you need for acceleration and uphill driving.  There is very little about this truck that I dislike.  There is no beverage holder for the front passenger (nothing that would say me from buying one myself).  The gas mileage (given today's prices) might be another detail I would like to improve.
