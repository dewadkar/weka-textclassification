                 With me along for help and moral support, my fiance bought a Toyota Corolla VE in October of 1999.  August is a good month, since there are incentives to clear the showroom for the next years models.  She got a good deal according to the consumer guides we checked later, though perhaps a hard bargaining maven could have done even better.  They wanted to sell her a car alarm based on the fact that it would save on her insurance.  She is a determined woman, and called the insurance company, verifying it would save her much less than it added to her payments on her five year plan.  Apparently they had an alarm already installed on a the vehicle they wanted to sell her, since they gave her a lower interest rate to get her to take the alarm.
     The salesman showed her how to fill out the evaluation form with a sample checking off excellent in every category - perhaps they were afraid she would be too shy to express her full joy, but she found it rather cheeky.  On the other hand, not only did they send a tin of cookies, but even sent another one when she called to say they arrived broken.  She thought the emergency brake was too hard to set, but they said it was supposed to be that way on her follow up maintenance visit.  At first she had trouble with the front and rear defrosters - they said she wasn't using them right, and she uses the controls differently now, but she thinks something may have been wrong originally as well, though I suspect not.
     As you probably know, a Corolla is small, but a good buy for the money, and she's learned to adjust the seats.  Price is approximate, and I don't remember the exact package but car was an automatic transmission.<br><br>
