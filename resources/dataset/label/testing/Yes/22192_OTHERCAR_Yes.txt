            I like most everyone have had various traditional film cameras. What I have found after having a digital camera for a while is I tend to take many more pictures and I also look to take the camera with me wherever I go due to its ease of use. 

This is my second digital camera. My first, the Epson Photo PC800 was a disappointment but this camera is a delight. Before purchasing this camera I went through extensive research after being burned by my first purchase. 

The 2X optical zoom is a must have feature and works great on this camera. The digital zoom is a feature that is of little use in my opinion on any camera as the amount of distortion and pixelization present when utilizing this feature makes it not worth using. 

There is virtually no delay between photos on the DC 3400 whereas on other cameras there is a wait before you can snap back to back pictures. This is because the DC3400 has a buffer memory that allows you to snap pictures back to back. 

The battery life is satisfactory although I would suggest investing in two sets of rechargable batteries and a recharger as purchasing regular batteries can get costly.

Transfer of photos to your pc via USB is convenient. The best way to do so though is to get a separate compact flash reader as transfer directly from the camera eats up valuable battery life. 

One of the only cons is that the LCD screen on the camera must be activated manually, it doesnt come on automatically, the reason given is to conserve battery life, but the main reason for having a digital camera is being able to use the LCD screen. 

Otherwise this is a great feature laden camera that has given me newfound pleasure in the great hobby of photography.<br><br>
