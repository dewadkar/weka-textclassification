            Let me first say that this wonderful car came to me about three years ago with over 105,000 miles on it.  20,000 miles and 3 years later... this admirable 4 cylinder engine is still running strong.  I live in a very cold climate... both in central Maine and at school in central NY, yet I have NEVER had a problem with it starting up or with driving it in the trying conditions of subzero climates.  I have a 7 hour drive from home to college, and I always feel confident in the continued reliability of my car.  My particular Altima is a GLE model with the rare heads up display option.  I am not sure why Nissan chose to discontinue this option as I find it highly beneficial and loathe the prospect of buying a car without it in the future.  If you can get your hands on an Altima with the heads up display option.... grab it!!!  This car is a gem.... well worth passing over newer, less reliable domestic versions....
