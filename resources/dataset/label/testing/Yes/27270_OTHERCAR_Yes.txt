            On March 1st 2000, My girl friend got the urge to buy a brand new car. So we drove around looking for some good places to shop at. She has always wanted a new Pontiac Firebird. Well, we found her dream car and she just fell in love with it. I could tell that this was the car for her. She took it out for a ride and then came back like 15-20 minutes later in tears. The dealer and I asked her what was wrong and she Just looked at us and started crying even harder. She told us that she had fallen in love with this car and is going to buy it and make payments. We were all laughing so hard because we thought something had happen, The only thing that happen was that she fell in love with her dream car and she was going to buy it.

Her Pontiac Firebird drives great. She let me drive it only a few times but it was worth it. It has great control and is really good on gas. The seats are very comfortable and roomy. The back seat is a little cramped up but its no biggy. She loves everything about it so I take it as a great car!

I would recommend this car to anyone who loves to drive and have fun. If you love sporty vehicles and love to drive fast then this is the car for you. If you don't like any of that then this isn't the car for you. <br><br>
