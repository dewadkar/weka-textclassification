            This SUV is definitely one of the best on the market.  Not only is it durable, and stylish, it is practical.  There is much more leg room than in most others, particularly Jeep Cherokees.

I drive a 1991 Eddie Bauer edition and I know they have only improved since this original was marketed.  This edition has leather seats, and adjustable seat comforters.  The new ones also have cd players and sun roofs optional.  4x4 is also an option.

Though this car does not get the best mileage (~12 mpg), especially in the snow (under 10mpg), the extra room and durability makes it worthwhile.  It is easy to drive to anybody used to a big car and it is easy to adjust to. The ride is surprisingly smooth, acceleration is good.  Oil does not need to be changed very frequently.  The one thing I hope they improved in the new vehicles is the air system, it is a little out-of-date and difficult to adjust.
