            Sounds like Nissan is punching out new ideas for there pick-up truck version. Questions that I ask are about dependability, price, and power. I have owned a 1986 Nissan and now currently own at 99 Nissan Frontier. The old Nissan came with a 2.4 ltr. Z-24 engine. Nissan boasted on the technology of two sparks plugs per cylinder for boosted power at high rpms. I must admit I was skeptical about it then, but that engine ran until 176,000 miles without a problem. I had the heads rebuilt and drove it for another 100,000 miles with no problems, except for the alternator change. This was a very dependable truck, except on the body wear. All Nissans of that year seem have rust problems in the wheel wells. Shifting gears was also found to be difficult in cold weather, but an easy fix for that was to use synthetic transmission fluid. The truck held up excellent. I know many other owners the drove there trucks  up to the 300,000 mile range before engine problems. I am currently driving the 99 frontier and love it. I have managed to put roughly 45,000 miles on it in the past year. I have had problems with the passenger side window rolling down, but that was fixed by Nissan without cost to me. Nissan has provided excellent service to me and always sold me a dependable vehicle. The Frontier is in excellent truck and dependable. Simply put it just holds up. I literally drive it into the ground with work. That truck is my office. I know many are skeptical about a foreign truck, but drive one for a month and your view will change. Nissan also has increased power by having a 3.0 ltr V-6 engine now instead of the In-line 4. I would strongly recommend the manual transmission if you are looking to tow things quiet a bit or order one with the four wheel drive option. The Quad cab is something new, but in the past, Nissan's attempts to step out of the guidelines for improvement have worked and I think this is a good idea. If the bed space is a little too small I will let you in on a little secret. Chevy will be coming out with a four door mid-size pick up in 2001 in which the back cab  opens into the bed for hauling longer materials. I'm guessing this truck will be a little more pricey. Maybe between the cost of a chevy extended cab and a Suburben. If you decide on the Nissan I guarantee you an excellent and dependable truck with little or no hassle, as long as general maintenance is kept on the truck. <br><br>
