            This car is priced new to be almost head to head with such cars as the Mercedes E320 and BMW 528i.  There is no way on this planet that it's competitive with either.

But for some strange reason, rental car companies don't buy Mercedes E320s or BMW 528is, or at least not in enough bulk to charge under $200 a day for them.  At about $ 300-400 per week, the Town Car is an almost affordable extravagance for those of us who have to rent.

The Town Car is charmingly pretentious, even if the hideous fake wood in the interior fails to convince. Comfy leather seats, an easy to use air conditioning system, and supreme comfort on long trips are the basic strengths.

Handling is surprisingly good, if uninvolving compared to a European sports sedan.  Ride is surprisingly poor on potholed roads, but smooths up nicely on the freeway.  Like every column shift I have seen, the Lincoln's is wobbly and often winds up in the wrong gear.

I wobbled between loving the aggressive masculinity of the styling, and thinking the side of the car looked too much like a SUV.  If you want to make a good superficial impression, the Lincoln's hard to beat.

I was reluctant to turn it back, despite its faults.  Overall, a fun experience.

Incidentally, the second time I rented a Lincoln was during high season at Budget.  I had a reservation for a Ford Contour, but all they had was the Lincoln.  They honored the $ 239/week rate and gave me the Lincoln, which I thought was rather decent of them.
