            I always wanted and XJ-S. I was too young for an E-type (which I though was pretty but for old people) and thought the XJ-S was new modern fresh styling (I was 10 years old at the time). I thought the flying buttress rear end was dramatic and distinctive. Everyone else hated the S, it had of course replaced the beloved E Type, but by the early seventies the E-type had become an outdated, outperformed and outstyled remnant of the sixties...life moves on. What harmed the XJ-S was the fact that the British Motor Industry went into tailspin and production quality followed. The S suffered badly at first and my advice is to stay away from anything pre- 19881/2 model year.
I have had a couple of flings with the S over the last 12 years. Each one sweet but different as time goes on.The first was while working for Jaguar in Coventry, England. I did not have any cars but got to drive them regularly as part of my job in Product Planning. This meant getting your hands on Ferraris, Porsche, Maseratis, Aston, Prototype Jags etc..and of course brand new XJ-Ss. V12s, 3.6liters, 4.0liters, Cabrios, Convertibles yeah!!!! It was boy heaven and I loved it.
Now a brand new Jaguar is something else, the smell of Connolly leather has a similar effect to a couple of glasses of red wine mixed with the faint smell of Issey Miyake perfume..then you sit in the sumptuous seats and look at a decent bit of walnut covered dash. Then you fire the engine and whether its a V12 or straight 6, there's a growl that sound cat-like, its more than a purr but less than a roar! Ride and handling were excellent and the only complaint was that in a car 5 yards long there is no room inside except for you and your girl - dinky seats in rear definitely not important. This car was 'rather nice'...
Then I grew up left Jaguar had a family and found myself in Germany a couple of years ago. All of a sudden I found myself wanting an XJ-S again (yep MLC) and I found a beauty in England. A 3.6 liter straight six coupe  with 5 speed manual box. Fully loaded with half leather seats, 48,000 miles and only ï¿½4000 ($6500). Well my wife did say that the Renault Clio was getting a bit small for the two little ones and that when she went shopping there was little room to put the stroller in etc etc. The stroller fit in the trunk..the kids had to squeeze in a bit, and it is was not easy parking your car at the local Supermarkt when your hood basically fits the parking bays on its own!
The car was great..but time does funny things to your body bits..they start to droop and wilt..and the Jag was no exception, in fact its not as good as say a Mercedes or Porsche in this department. The engine and transmission was still fantastic. The ride and handling glorious. Performance still good enough to blow most things away. Interior styling still smart despite the weird looking dials and speedometer (odd quirky British. The annoying things was it suddenly developed a water leak around the screen that we could not find. We changed screen 3 types, sealed, resealed but nothing. This rotted the carpets but worst of all it showed up the shoddy workmanship of the door trims (leather over hardboard - these disintegrated. Then the walnut veneer peeled off so car looked a touch tatty. I still loved her but she was getting past it...so after restoring to a decent state sold her 3 years later for the same price as bought - so cheap motoring really.
Would I recommend one - yes, late model. Why? Do not know, great value for money, styling, ride, handling and wonderfully reliable if looked after - these cars stand out. Would I have another..yes, probably a convertible V12 out of California..kids can still squeeze in the back!
