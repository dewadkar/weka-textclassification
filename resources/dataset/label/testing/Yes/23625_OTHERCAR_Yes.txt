            I used to own a 1995 Jeep Wrangler.  And I absolutely LOVED it!  It was all I wanted for a vehicle.  That is, until I became pregnant.  So it seemed that I would require a more &quot;family-ish&quot; vehicle.  Station wagons were out of the question.  So we bought a 1996 Jeep Cherokee Sport.  And we LOVE it! However, I do have 2 complaints.

The front seat is very roomy and comfortable.  But I think the back seat is better for kids than adults.  The back seat tends to be cramped and I find it uncomfortable to ride in back for long periods.  It is also somewhat awkward to get out because the back door is small and the tire well makes for a tight fit.  Kids, however, do not have this problem.  Many a road trip has passed with no complaints from the back.  With the addition of a car seat things do get tight, but they have yet to complain.

The Jeep came with this plastic thing with 2 round holes in it and it hooks on to the side of the console. I think it's supposed to be -- a cup holder? Problem is, when you put a heavy drink in it, it falls.  If you go over a bump, it falls.  If the passenger barely nudges it, it falls.  Very, very poor design.

The good news!  The ride is great.  Our Jeep has a straight 6-cylinder and boy, what POWER!  We like to take the Jeep out on jeep trails and the performance is superb.  Mud, snow, rocks, or the occasional stream there is nowhere the Jeep won't go.  With plenty of cargo room, we're able to fit all our backpacking gear. Plus kids. Yet the vehicle stays compact and can turn on a dime.  Not like those other SUV's that are just monstrous.  

This vehicle is perfect for people who need a family car but refuse to drive a station wagon or a mini-van.
