            In the market for a good used car?  Consider the Pontiac Grand Prix.  I recently purchased a 1994 Model, and am as proud of it as I could be of any brand new car.  This is the vehicle I've been looking for.  It has power, good looks, and lots of little extras.  Even brand new, you get a lot of car for your money.  It has lots of leg room for the people up front, but even I must admit the leg room leaves a bit to be desired for the backseat driver.  My model is loaded.... A/C, cruise, power windows and doors, and best of all, steering wheel stereo controls.  The only thing I can truly find that I don't like about it is the lighting system.  It is equipped with safety driving lights, which are on any time the car is running.  There are those rare times when I want to sit and let the engine run, without turning on the headlights.  In this car that is not possible, as they cannot be turned off.  Otherwise I love this car.  It came complete with keyless entry and only 56,000 miles for $7999.  A more than reasonable price to me for all the things I got.  The Grand Prix (4-door, in my case) gives you the best of both worlds.  Room for the family but still a sporty look.  And there can be nothing that compares to the sound of that Pontiac engine revving up!  New or used, with the Grand Prix you can't go wrong.<br><br>
