            (Male/Single/20s Perspective)

Simple and Clean best describes this car.  I mainly bought this car for two reasons: 1. It was time for me to get a car of my own and 2. I pulled the transmission on my old car (94 Ford Escort). I love this car from the beginning to now.  Again Simple and Clean.  Instead of spending hours on end choosing options and features, this was my thinking.

There are only 5 colors available; red (too flashy), black, white (both too hard to keep clean), sky blue (nice girl color - little to girlie for the guys, but not bad, my second choice) and dark green (which I picked). Inside color - black. Done.  Almost everything you could want is a standard feature.  Moonroof/Sunroof = std. Power Windows/Locks = std. CD Player = std. Passive Alarm = std. I don't like all the fancy power seats, quadruple memory thing-a-ma-jigs.  That's it - Simple.  The only option that I did buy extra was a rear wing.  The wing was 400$, but an aftermarket wing is almost the same price, so I gave them the business.
I did had an active/sensor alarm for 150$. Trunk space is plenty but depends on what you want to lug around.

Driving is a personal preference.  I don't care about how quiet it is in the car since I have the windows all the way down and the moonroof open even if the outside temp is 30 degrees.  Heat and A/C are powerful and gets the car cold or hot quickly.  Aerodynamics is great on the car during rain or snow, the airflow keeps the front and rear windows clear starting around 40mph. No need for wipers. Power and breaking are excellent.  I've driven this car in a foot of snow and it still performs very well.  The wide tires do give the car some potential to slide, but that's what wide tires are prone to do.  ABS works like it's suppose to =).  I haven't tested the airbags and I don't plan on it either =).  Engine noise is quiet.  Comfort is like any sports car - you'll feel the bumps, but not that noticable.

For all it's worth, I'd say I'm very happy with this car.  The car is durable enough to handle an insane driver like myself (135+ mph through Pennsylvania I-83N) to city driving weaving through the buses and the &quot;grandma/pa&quot; drivers.  You can whip someone up off the starting line and break fast enough to let the other person get the ticket for speeding.  Cruising around is great.  Factory stereo has enough bass kick so I can feel the beats but not make me go deaf by the time I'm 30.  I've had 4 people in my car and it is a little tight, but this is supposed to be Your sports car (you and someone else) for Your enjoyment not a taxi to drive your friends around in.  Gas fillup is roughly every 4 days driving 70mph. (310 miles)<br><br>
