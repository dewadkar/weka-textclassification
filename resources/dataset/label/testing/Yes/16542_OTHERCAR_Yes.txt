            I have had my Nissan 240SX Coupe since 1990.  I love the car.  The features that I enjoy the most are the movable steering wheel, an automatic car antenna, automatic windows, a sun roof that opens all the way, and the best part, a speed display that displays the speed you are going on the window directly in front of you. I have never seen any other car that has this feature. Also, I have never been in a car that corners as well as my car.  Fun driving through mountains (but my passengers sometimes get sick).

I had (until recently) not had many problems with the car except for the
fuel injectors (I've had to replace them 3 times).  The mechanics explained to me that if I didn't catch it soon enough my car would ignite. I was very happy to hear that!  :-(((  Turns out that it's a manufacturers flaw and nothing can be done about it.  Also, I have replaced the automatic car antenna twice and the clip that holds the sun roof in place twice. After 10 years, my car failed it's smog inspection.  Turns out the catalytic converter and the fuel pressure gauge went bad.

One thing I should note is that I am 5'2&quot;.  The car is built for small people! My Dalmatian loves to ride in the small back seat.  When any man rides in my car that is over 6' I have to open the sun roof. Also, it is very difficult to put a bike in the car.  I have to remove my bike wheel and put the bike diagonal inside the car. 

I should also note that this is the 3rd Nissan that I have had.  I have never had major problems with them except for this fuel injector problem.  I am, however, hesitant to buy another Nissan because of this problem since from what I understand there is no other alternative manufacturer for that part and I do not like that fact that gas was pouring onto my engine.  Too scary.     <br><br>
