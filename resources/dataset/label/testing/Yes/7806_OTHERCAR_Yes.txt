            We bought our 1994 SL2 when it was a year old.  It had been a lease - rental and had 8,000 miles on it at the time.

It now has 112,000 miles on it.  In the 6 years we have had the car, it's only major problem was the catalytic converter going bad, resulting in a rattle &amp; loss of power, though it did not prevent the car from being reliably used or make it unsafe.  Saturn even replaced it for free, and even gave us a couple of T shirts for our trouble.

No other problems have resulted outside of normal maintenance.  I've been driving for 30 years and I have never owned any other vehicle that was this reliable.  I have driven the car completely across the country, and gotten 40 MPG while speeding most of the time!  It's comfortable &amp; attractive, reliable and great for both commuting and long distance driving.

For tall people, you might want to avoid a model with the built in &quot;moon roof&quot; (what makes this different from a sun roof I don't know)as it decreases the headroom about 3-4 inches.  But I had a friend with the same car that did not have the moon roof who was 6'2&quot; and he fit just fine in his car.  I'm 5'10&quot; and my wife is shorter and we fit very comfortably in ours.

We will be driving this same car for years to come.  My Toyota Camry of the same vintage has reached the point where mechanical failures of various types are happening on a regular basis, but not with this car.<br><br>
