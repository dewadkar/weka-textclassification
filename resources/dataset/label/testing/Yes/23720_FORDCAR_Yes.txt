            We bought this used. Our first car in which we needed to make payments and at $342 a month it had better be dependable! It is.

 We drove from Washington State to Arizona with three kids and a dog. The car was roomy and set up great for a roadtrip. We has the oil and such changed before we left. It got excellent gas mileage.

My mother-in-law owned a Ford Taurus( that was older than mine) for eight years and until the past year it had done pretty well. Recently the fuel pump went and many other things.

It was in one accident, when I was hit by another driver on the side. We easily picked up the replacement front fender and mirror, then had it painted and you'd never be able to tell- except for the door open notice in the dashboard that comes on even when all the doors are shut.

One problem we have found with the Taurus wagons is the cheap tires they come with. They wear unevenly and you end up replacing them too soon.

It successfully relocated us from Washington to Minnesota with no problems at all.

The major problem I have with the Ford Taurus Wagon is in the back seatbelts. The center one is fine, the two side back seatbelts get jammed constantly. Then when you have all three kids in the back of the car and we're all buckling up the dreaded phrase is heard-
"Mom, my seatbelt isn't working again"
Sometimes if you feed it back in gently it'll go, but otherwise we have to take it apart and fix it.

All in all it's a good car. It gets you from point A to point B which is exactly what it's for. Next time I'm going for much lower payments!
