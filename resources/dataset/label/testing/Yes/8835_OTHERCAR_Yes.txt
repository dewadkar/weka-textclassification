                As I wrote in my earlier opinion Hondas Are Built To Last!  I said that when I decided to by a new car, it would be an Accord.  Well, two weeks ago I did just that.  I knew that I couldn't go wrong buying another Honda.  My Civic provided me with 11 great years and 216,000 miles of service and I was sad to see it go, but I knew it was time.  I did get teary-eyed when I had to sign the papers trading it in.  My friends said they would miss that car as much as I did.  I was told that when I did get a new Honda, it would have to be the same color (blue) that my Civic was.

   I went to the Honda dealership when I had purchased my Civic.  I test-drove a beige Accord that was a demo car.  I liked it, but it didn't feel like me.  Then I saw a silver Accord with blue interior.  I got in, drove it and knew that this was the car for me.

    One reason I decided on an Accord was that I am getting older.  Not old, mind you, but older.  My friends and I are getting too old to climb in the back seat, hence a four-door car.  Another reason I got an Accord was that it makes taking both my Grandfather Smith and my Grandma Cowan places easier for them.  It was getting especially difficult for Grandma to get in and out of my car since she broke her hip.  My Civic was too low to the ground, and the Accord is just right for both of my grandparents to get in and out of with ease.  I also just wanted a bigger car.  With a lot of friends having children now, I knew at some point I would be asked to baby-sit or to take them places and I knew a four-door car was in order.

    I know it has only been two weeks now, but I love this car!  Both the front and back seats are roomy.  I also like the compartments that are the Accord.  The arm rest in the front seat has two compartments.  One for loose change, and if you lift it up, there is another, bigger place to keep things like CD's, pens, gum and other miscellaneous stuff that I used to keep on the front seat of my Civic.

    The car handles like a dream.  The engine is quiet and smooth.  One feature I discovered by accident is that if you leave the key in the ignition, you can't lock the driver side door.  The key has to be out before you can lock the doors.  That will come in handy for me.  I have locked my keys in the car on more than one occasion.  The Accord has both driver and passenger air bags.  Also, you can't start the car unless your foot is on the brake pedal.  You also can't take it out of park unless you have the key in the ignition.  In my opinion, this is probably one of the safest cars on the market today.  If you are thinking about getting a new car, you can't go wrong buying a Honda!
