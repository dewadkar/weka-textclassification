            We looked at several different makes of cars before coming to the Altima.  I'm currently in medical school and I have a wife and two sons, so quality and cost were a premium.  We looked at the Mazda 626 (wimpy engine), Honda Accord (too expensive),and others.  The Altima has the best of everything.  Good ride, easy to drive, good gas milage, good fuel economy, and good handling (even after 88K miles).  We also needed space both in the car and in the trunk( for the baby strollers), the Altima had plenty of both, especially in the trunk.  I think it is the mid-sized car with the most trunk space.This is a car for any small family.  I don't think there is anything to love or hate about this car, it is just a solid performer, one gets a lot of bang for the buck.<br><br>
