            We purchased our Dodge Grand Caravan in June of 1999.  It is a used van but the most comfortable and pleasurable vehicle I have ever owned.  We needed a van because our family consists of 5 of us and we each have our own seat and lots of room so that everyone is happy.  The extras in my van, like the CD player, the sunglasses holder and all the extra cup holders help to make it a happier and smoother ride whenever we are taking long, or even short trips.  I love driving my van because it rides so well, and is extremely comfortable.  This is certainly a van I would recommend to any family, as it is roomy and certainly performs very well on any road.  I would have to say that people who do not have children would probably not need to own a van, but it they wanted one anyway, this would be the van to purchase.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!<br><br>
