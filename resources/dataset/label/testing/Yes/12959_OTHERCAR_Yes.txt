            After one drive in my mother's Chevrolet Malibu, I knew I had to buy one for myself.  The car drives smoothly, gets excellent mileage, and really makes a good value.  After test driving numerous other cars (the Pontiac Grand Am, Pontiac Sunfire, and Mercury Mystique), I knew that the Malibu was the right kind of car.  

I can't say that my experience with the Malibu has been hassle free.  I recently had to leave the car with a dealership for over a week while the transmission was rebuilt (around 33,000 miles had been driven on the car).  However, during the time that the car was in the shop, General Motors provided me with a rental car free of charge and also provided me with excellent updates on the status of my car.

I would recommend this car for someone looking for a little bit of luxury at an affordable price.  Although the car is not the ultimate in any sense of the word, it is a very nice car that is well worth the price.
