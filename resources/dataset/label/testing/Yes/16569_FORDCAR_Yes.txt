            I originally was looking at this vehicle because of price. I found the Ford Ranger to be an extreme value. I purchased the XLT Supercab with the 4DR option. I didn't know they had four doors at the time of purchase (8/98). I was sold when I saw the possibilities. What I love is the convenience of the extra doors.
I opted for the 4cyl. Engine for commute reasons but recommend the V6 for frequent hauling. Don't get me wrong, the 4cyl. does stand up to serious duty if needed. As with all small truck extended cabs you can't use the back seat for adults on long trips. Short trips are ok in small quarters like that. I like that the ford rides higher than most small trucks. It handles quite well for a truck and the seats are pretty comfortable. What I don't like is the fact my truck came with 14 inch rims which are harder to find the tires I like for. Other than that I am very happy with this vehicle. I recommend this particular truck for light duty, get the V6 for anything more.
