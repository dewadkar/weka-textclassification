            I currently own a 1987 Toyota 4Runner, and even with 175,000 miles on it she's still going strong. Toyota's are notorious for holding a high resale value because of their solid construction and long lists of features and options.

The current 4 wheel drive system is one of the better ones on the market (check http://www.offroad.com for comparisons). From personal experience in 
both a 1987 and a 1998 4Runner the truck handles as well as it does on the road as it does on the trail. I have gotten in a few precarious spots myself and been surprised that I haven't needed a winch to get out of. The 98 models and above have the option of a rear locking differential that is a blessing when you think that all hope is gone.

Beautiful styling in both the interior and exterior of the vehicle makes it pleasing to the eye and functional as well. Controls are mounted on the dashboard in the correct places to aid the driver's overall comfort.

I strongly recommend this vehicle for the type of person who not only wants an SUV for looks but functional aspects as well. Anyone from a college 
student to a soccer mom can appreciate the space and design of the truck, Toyota has certainly done an excellent job designing and maintaining the 
4Runner since it's inception in 1984 and continues to do so with each new model it manufactures.
