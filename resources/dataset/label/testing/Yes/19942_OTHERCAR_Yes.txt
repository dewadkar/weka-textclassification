            I bought a new '93 Toyota Celica ST (with the 1.6 L 4 cyl. engine) as my first car 9 years ago.  97,500 miles later, I have not had to take it to a shop for a major repair, it runs wonderfully, and I still regularly get 34-36 mpg.  

I spent a great deal of time researching vehicles and test-driving them at the time, and since my grandfather and uncle worked for General Motors, I was considering several GM vehicles.  Despite the fact that I would have received a sizable discount on a GM vehicle, the track record of the Celica was much better than the other cars I was considering at that time (Olds Cutlass and Achieva, Buick Skylark, Z34), and you could literally feel the difference in quality as you closed the doors, drove the car, etc.

Now, nearly 10 years later, I realize I definitely made the right choice.  With nearly 100,000 miles on it, these are the only things I have had ANY problems with (and they are very minor.  (1)Seat belt retractor spring replaced: these seem to be relatively weak, and have given out--Replacement cost: $25 including labor.  (2)Dash problem from dome light replacement: When I replaced a burned out dome light bulb, I apparently did not get perfect contact, frying some electrical part in the dash--cost: $250 with labor.  (3) Recently, my AIR BAG light has been lit, but I haven't had that looked at yet.  THAT'S IT!  

Otherwise, I recently replaced my timing belt (as suggested for maintenance), the water pump (as preventive maintenance while the timing belt was being replaced), and 4 spark plugs.  My mechanic, after taking off and inspecting the belt and water pump, said that both were still in great shape.  Replacing the spark plugs (which cost $4 for all four) made a big difference in how the engine idled.

I also have a few suggestions if you are considering buying a Celica from this era: (1) spend the extra $200 or $500 to have the acoustic undercoat placed on the bottom of the car.  While I rated the Quality and Craftsmanship as 5 (indicating there are no squeaks or rattles), this car sits close to the ground, and this will help kill the road noise (which is quite noticeable).  (2) DO NOT use any sort of window cleaner or armor-all product on the dash glass.  This causes a hazing or water-spot effect on the glass, and is very annoying when you are trying to view the dials.  I am considering replacing mine.

Other than those 2 minor complaints, I have absolutely loved my Celica.  Many of my friends and family members bought "American made" cars since I bought my Celica, and all of them have been in the repair shop and have those annoying rattles in odd places.  Since seeing how much better my Toyota has held up over the years, my parents bought Toyota vehicles when they sold their GM products.  They might cost a little more up front, but I have found that the reliability more than makes up for it in the long run.
