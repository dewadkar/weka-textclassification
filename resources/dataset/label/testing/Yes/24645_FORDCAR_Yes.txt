            When we bought this minivan it was the day before I had my son ( Our 3rd child ), 8/19/00. We currently had a '93 Dodge Spirit and needed a second car to transport our daughters back and forth to school and girl scouts, and so on.
I never really liked vans and I always felt they were 'boaty' but the Spirit which holds 5 people tightly would've been too small.
My husband was at work and my sister and I were checking out used cars and we had ''Windstar's, 'Transports' and 'Villager's to choose from. The Aerostar was the last one we looked at between the group and the only one I test drove.It rode quiet and smooth. When I first saw it I looked in from the siding door and noticed that it had plenty leg room-6'2" hubby- comfortable looking seats and that they were removeable and that the backs on the benchs could be callapsed. The middle bench seats 2 people and the rear bench seats 3.
Next I looked in from the front passenger side and noticed this van was well taken care of for its age. No rips, smells or stains. It has blue interior with cloth seats. Very roomy storage in glove box and in console in between drivers and passenger seats. Cruise control, power locks and windows. Rear windshield wiper. 
When we bought it it had 57000 and now it has a little over 63000. 
We've gone on a road trip last Christmas '00 and it handled it very well. The kids had enough room to spread out without being on top of each other. The trip was about 1400 miles round trip and it got very good gas miliage. When the tank is pretty low it takes about $25.00 of unleaded to fill and we had to only fill twice during the trip. In the city I only have to fill it maybe twice a month and still have half a tank left.
Normal maintance needed. We had to replace the front tires before the trip and afterwards we found out that the serpantine belt was starting to frey and replaced it. We also had to get a freon charge and new battery, the van had its original. Plus a oil change. 
The exterior was in excellent condition. It is white with blue running stripes all around and looks really sharp when it's clean. 
When we first got this van I thought it was alot different feel from a sedan. Higher up, shorter nose, longer end. Had a little problems hopping curbs in the begining, lol. Also I am 5'5" and the drivers seats back is high up so it blocks my view being able to look over my shoulder when changing lanes so I've used my mirrors more than I had to in our sedan.
It doesn't feel 'boaty' to me like I thought vans MIGHT be, cause I learned to drive in a '79 Buick Regal, and that WAS boaty, at the time.
We are getting ready to move in a month or so and both back benchs being able to be removed will be of great help. It'll be like having a truck in a way. My husband, in August '00, had to remove just the rear bench to put a apartment sized washing machine in the back and it had room to spare, probably could've fit a full sized washer in there.
The only problem is on windy days, we get blown around a bit, other than that it has treated us well. Looking back on the other selections at the time, I feel that our van has more leg room and storage space in the back. It was very affordable at the time being on a tight budget.
