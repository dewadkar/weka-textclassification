            I purchased my Kodak Easy Share digital camera about one year ago, and I must say that this camera has been a revolutionary breakthrough in the way I take pictures forever. I bought it on the internet from a website that I can no longer recall. Actually, I had another camera before this. It was a Poloroid digital camera I believe. But it broke and we had to get another.

First off, the Kodak Easy Share is incredibly versitale and easy to use. It fits snugly inside a black carrying case that you can carry just about anywhere with you! Taking pictures is frankly easy enough for even an amatuer to perform. You simply set it to its "auto" setting, hold the shutter button down half-way, (to adjust the lighting) and then when the green light flashes, push the shutter button all the way down. The camera will then automatically show you the picture you just took, (pretty awesome, huh?) and after approximately 5 seconds you will be transported back to your normal setting and will be able to then take another picture.

This camera is amazingly diverse and has frankly just too many features too keep up with! The features include:

Auto picture taking (regular)
Sport picture taking (in motion subjects)
Night picture taking (dark)
Landscape picture taking (objects far away)
Close-up picture taking (objects close)
Video taking (takes up lots of memory)
Review of your pictures inside camera
Close up
Back off
Picture Timer
Auto Flash
Fill Flash
Red Eye
Picture Deleter
Menu options

I have had many experiences using my camera. I have taken it to school field trips, theme parks, vacations, and I think it's been to a wedding. Oh and also a talent show! 

This camera also comes with some wonderful software. The software gives you, the photographer, the oppurtunity to digitally enhance your pictures, correct red eye, convert to sepia tone, convert to black and white tone, convert to cartoon style, convert to fisheye style, (goofy style)and crop (make a picture within a picture).

I really do not hate anything about this product and I hope it serves me well in the future.

Overall, I would suggest this Kodak EasyShare Digital Camera to anyone who would be interested in photography as a career, photography as a hobby, family photos for an album, or any photography really. It's a remarkably easy digital camera to use, gives great quality pictures, and is indeed reccomended by myself.

Bottom Line- Great quality camera for great quality photographer. (or normal average amateur photographer for that matter)!
