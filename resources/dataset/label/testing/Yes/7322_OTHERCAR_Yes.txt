            I have had this camera for a year now. This camera has everything a novice photographer would need. It has great picture quality, and it is extreme durable. I've taken this camera to school quite a few times and it really takes a pounding in my bookbag. The school newspaper was issued 10 D-460's and they all work like new after a year of use (or abuse).

My biggest gripe about the 460 is its battery life. Battery life is ridiculous with regular alkalines. With alkalines, you're not able to use the LCD. I bought seperate Ni-MH 1600mAh batteries. They were $40, but they work beautifully. I would take the camera to school about 3 times a week and I wouldn't have to recharge for 2 or 3 weeks.

The memory card is awesome. Most camera only supply 4MB cards. The 460 comes with 8MB. You can hold 110 pics at normal quality, 36 pics at high quality, and 12 pics at super high quality. I used super high quality only once. It is really not necessary because the pictures come out so big, that they take forever to download on a website. I usually use high quality. The great thing about this is that you only pay for the camera once, unlike with regular film where you have to pay for film and development over and over again.

The photo quality is pretty good. The only thing I dont like is when taking picture under yellowish light. Pics come out really dark, even if it is bright. But this can be solved by using the flash. Over all, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a fun, easy to use digital camera, and doesn't want to spend a crazy amout of money.
