            I think that this vehicle is everthing to be expected for the price you will pay.  The reason I bought this vehicle was because of price.  I never would have thought for such little money you could get so much luxury.  The leather is so quality and the cd player.  What I like the most is the sunroof.  If you have a wreck you will not have to worry about the sunroof breaking.  It is shatter proof.  I think that it would not hurt for the 4-runner to have a little more power.  It has a great deal of power but, it would not hurt for the 4-runner to have a little more power.   The person I think that should need this vehicle is a real worker like a drug rep., doctor or someone of that nature or just for luxury.  It doesn`t really use a lot of gas, but will go a long way.  <br><br>
