            My mom bought a 1994 Dodge Intrepid, and it is a VERY nice car!  She has had a couple of problems with it, but other than that, it is a nice car.  She has had a broken water pump.  Things that could happen to just about any car that you see driving around the town.  The car rides very smooth, is very quiet, and when you go over bumps, it is like nothing at all.  The one problem with Dodge Intrepid's (this is by here-say) is that they hydro-plane a lot, so be careful when it rains or snows and then melts.  So far, this statement is true.  She has mildly hydro-planed a few times, nothing too serious, but if you have one, be careful none-the-less.  Just to be on the safe side.  
This car is great for just about anyone.  It is a pretty big car, and most younger people aren't into that huge boat type of a car.  <br><br>
