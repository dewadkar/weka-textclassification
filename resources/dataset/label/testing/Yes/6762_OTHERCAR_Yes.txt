            The 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe was a huge surprise. It's Hyundai's first SUV and it blows away its competition (Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute, Jeep Cherokee, etc.) in style, ride, and value. They've succeeded in creating one of the top vehicles on the market and bringing pride to the Hyundai brand.

The GLS model has standard 181-hp, 2.7L V6 and automatic transmission (with manual Shiftronic control), power windows/locks, power heated mirrors, CD/cassette stereo (with CD-changer controls), driver-side lumbar, rear privacy glass, and plenty more to impress and make your life easier.

The Santa Fe is definitely a head-turner, with unique styling that might take a little getting used to. In my opinion, it has plenty of acceleration and passing power. It feels and handles like a car.

The Santa Fe is a great option for anyone in the market for a new SUV, especially the smaller ones like the CR-V. I shopped for a while and the price and standard features of the Santa Fe almost had me sold even before I drove one.
