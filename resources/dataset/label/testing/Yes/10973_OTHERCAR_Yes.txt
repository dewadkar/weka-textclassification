            The Chevy Suburbon
  I am currently and have been an owner of a chevrolet 1500 4 wheel drive suburbon for approxiamently one year. This vehicle has it all, the stylish and sleek city look, as well as the rugged and sturdy off-road appearence.
  My suburbon has provided me with everything i could look for in a vehicle. Durability, which is in high demand in my life has been very noticable. My 98 model has only been to the mechanic to have the oil changed an tire's rotated an balanced. The gas mileage is descent giving me around 16 miles to the gallon on the highway, and the forty gallon tank allows me ample time between fill-ups.
  My particular taste tempted me to beef my chevy up.For the exterior look I had a three inch body lift installed an mounted on 33x12.50 BFgoodwrench allterrain tire's on american racing rims. Added front an rear bumpers an weston stepsides. Interior was not left behind i had an eclipse cd reciever an two phoenix gold 12 pushed by a phoenix gold 900 watt amp installed to give me an my passengers( holds up to 7 pasengers comfortably)the sound quaility they enjoy, on plush leather seats.
  When I make my next vehicle purchase it will definately be the new 2000 model, with bigger egine capacity and body style changed it proves to be the next chevrolet to turn heads. <br><br>
