            The Acura 3.2TL NAVI comes with a sticker price of $30,514.  This includes one option: floor mats.  The list of standard equipment is overwhelming.  It includes 225-hp 3.2-liter V6, SportShift automanual transmission(both automatic and manual), traction control, high-intensity discharge headlights, heated leather seats, Bose CD sound system, power moonroof, alloy wheels, AND a navigation system.  All that for a little more than 30k.  Or you have an option to buy the other version.  The one with everything but the navigation system.  This knocks off $2,000 off the price.

For the TL, the front suspension has been revised, to be more responsive and to provide a more linear steering feel.  The rear suspension is a freshly engineered compact five link setup.  
The TL also introduces the company's 60-degree 3.2-liter, 24-valve, VTEC aluminum V6.  

One disappointment that I did come face to face with was when the navigation failed to recognize where we were.  But overall, I was very pleased with this vehicl<br><br>
