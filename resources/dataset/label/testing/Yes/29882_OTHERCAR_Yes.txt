            I have to say I got pretty lucky for my first car. Nevermind the fact it took me until I was twenty-five to get it.  
<b>
My husband and I went shopping looking to spend about 4-5K on a second car...MY car.  Our real factors were that it had to fit three kids comfortably, and my husband insisted on a V-6.  Other than that the field was wide open.
<b>
The '92 Cutlass Supreme SL I bought fit those criteria, and was far better than the many many other used cars we looked at in our price range.  The kids fit well, even with the carseat in, and the trunk is huge.  Short people (like me) and tall alike will enjoy the adjustable seats and tilt steering.  The interior of the car is elegant, and the outside is sporty for a car its size.  My Cutlass handles wonderfully too.
<b>
The downside is that while I have not had to make repairs often, when something did go wrong it ended up costing more than average.  But, seeing as how the Cutlass Supreme is built on basically the same frame as the Lumina, Grand Prix, and others, working on this car is very easy, as is finding parts, with the exception of the struts, which seem to be pretty unique to Oldsmobiles.
<b>
One piece of advice is that there was a brake recall on this model several yaers ago.  If you are looking to buy one, make sure and check with the owner or a mechanic to see if the car has had the recalled brakes replaced.
<b> 
Otherwise, fahrfegnugen!
