            I have the Toyota Camry and it is the second Camry I have bought. I absolutely think that this car is well worth the value. It comfortably fits five normal sized adults. I love the smoothness of the car and the easy handling. For a family, it is a great car to own, but for the young and the speed demons, my recommendations go out to the sports cars. The camry is not the best car to modify. Its body and chassis are too big and parts for it are hard to find. The newer models also offer daytime running lights, a feature that I find VERY useful. I never again have to use the light switch. <br><br>
