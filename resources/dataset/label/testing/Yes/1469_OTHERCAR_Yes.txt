            The Cadillac Escalade epitomizes the difference between American and European approaches to making a luxury sport utility vehicle.

I had the opportunity to spend 3-days driving the Escalade around central Utah last week. There is enough room for 5 full-sized passengers and their luggage � and I do mean all of their luggage!

This is a big truck (5575 pounds � dry) and that�s where it�s first weakness became obvious, the engine. The Escalade comes with a 5.7 liter GM small-block V8. This engine delivers 255 hp at 4600 RPM and 330 lb.-ft. of torque at 2800 rpm. This is connected to a 4-speed electronic-shift overdrive automatic with torque converter clutch and a final drive ratio of 3.73:1. The result is a drive train that is not up to the task it was intended. From a start, you can feel the 330 lb.-ft. of torque pulling the Escalade forward. However, you don�t get the sense that this vehicle could get out of the way quickly if it really needed to. In fact, this engine, coupled with the 4-speed transmission, was always working to find the right gearing combination to get the job done. On level roads, you can establish a specific speed and the engine will have no problems maintaining it. However, encounter a slight incline and the fun begins. Slowly but surely, the speedometer will show your velocity decreasing. Giving it more gas provides no reaction from the engine. Only after flooring the gas pedal and forcing the engine to downshift would you see the speedometer reverse directions � albeit slowly. 

My second major gripe was in the Escalade�s handling. I own a Mercedes SUV and driving these two machines is as different as night and day. Cadillac, in trying to make a more luxurious ride, installed a soft suspension system in the Escalade. This allows the truck to absorb the minor bumps and undulations while providing a soft, comfortable ride. However, this comfort comes with a cost. The back-end exhibits significant wag as you change lanes or make turns and the steering is imprecise and has no sense of center. My first day with the Escalade was somewhat unnerving. It required my constant attention to keep it in the lane. By the 3rd day, I felt more comfortable with this idiosyncrasy, but never got to the point that I felt relaxed when I drove. This is a complete contrast to the Mercedes where I immediately feel like I�m in a vehicle designed to drive and drive fast. One other brief note, the Escalade I drove had 15,000 miles on the odometer and its front brake rotors were already warped. This is possibly the result of defective parts or rotors that are too small for the application. Regardless, it made hard braking a game of nerves. 

The final criticism I have is about the materials used in the interior, specifically in the dash and doors. Escalade's are not cheap trucks ($47,000). The dash, minus the wood inlays, looks no different than any other GMC or Chevrolet truck. To be frank, it looks cheap. I would make the same criticism about the Mercedes M-Class, except it looks worse in the Cadillac. If I�m going to pay $47,000 for a SUV, I want it to look like it�s worth the money. The dash and door treatments leave you wanting.

Those criticisms aside, there are many cool features in the Escalade. I liked the fact I didn�t have to turn the headlights on at night � this was automatic (I didn�t like having daylight running lights though). There are two sets of cup holders for the front passengers. One set, located in the dash, kept things cold by placing your beverages in front of two A/C vents. The other set is located in the center console where it senses you have a warm beverage and heats up to insure your beverage remains warm. There is a Bose sound system that includes AM/FM, Tape and in-dash CD. The center console also has a 6-disc CD changer (excellent location). The sound system is road sensitive and raises/lowers the volume as the road noise increases/decreases.  All four outboard seats are heated (front and back). For those in the back, there is a special entertainment system that allows you to listen to your own music selection (radio or cassette), watch a video (flip-down LCD screen) or play video games. Never underestimate the value of this option on a long trip with children. I also liked the fact that the rear passengers could control their environment through remote fan controls on the climate control system.

Cadillac also includes your first year of OnStar service. This is GM�s version of on-road help. When you�re in a region that has a cellular phone system, pressing the OnStar button will provide you with immediate help, be it locating entertainment, restaurants or emergency roadside service. Included in the system is the equivalent of a homing beacon. Should an emergency occur, such as the deployment of your air bag, pressing the emergency button or having your vehicle stolen, Cadillac is able to summon emergency assistance and provide your vehicle location to authorities (within a 300� range). 

There is a lot to like and dislike about the Escalade. It is a comfortable ride with many of the creature comforts. It is not, however, a drivers vehicle. I think my son was right on when he said, �if you could just blend the creature comforts Cadillac provides with the driving characteristics of the Mercedes, you�d have quite the vehicle.� Now would that be the Daimler-Chrysler-Cadillac?
