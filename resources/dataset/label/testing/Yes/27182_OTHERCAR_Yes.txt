Toyota Sequoia SR5, 2002

As an oversize monster SUV, the Toyota Sequoia will definitely hold its own when compared with the Ford Expedition.

Those that have read some of my older reviews will know that I am not a big fan of anyone who buys these oversize toys just to keep up with the Jones.  

But,I have nothing against using them as working vehicles.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

As far as styling the Sequoia does look good. It is bigger than its competitor the Chevrolet Tahoe and is very close in size to the other road monster the Ford Expedition.

You can get the Sequoia in two different trims. The base model is the SR5 and the upscale model the Limited edition.

I drove the SR5 and as a base model it comes equipped with an excellent selection of standard features.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

When you first enter the Sequoia you know immediately that you are climbing into a big SUV, the ground clearance is full 101/2 inches from the ground, so you will really have to climb in.

The SR5 model does not come with leather seating, I think that it should at least have been offered as an option.

Behind the steering wheel the driver will have an excellent front vision, I was a little disappointed with the average side view mirrors, for a truck this size they should have installed much larger mirrors. 

The rear vision can be a problem for any body who has never driven a vehicle that size so be careful at first.

From the drivers seat you will have an excellent view of all the gauges and all the control buttons are within easy reach also.

The workmanship of the interior is outstanding, I could find nothing wrong.

The SR5 I test drove had the following standard features: air conditioning, power windows, power locks power mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, AM/FM cassette radio, CD player rear window defroster. The vehicle I drove also had
optional alloy wheel also.

There is ample space for both front and rear seat occupants.

The exterior:

Aside from not being too pleased with the side view mirrors, I do like the styling of the exterior body of the Sequoia.

The cargo volume is at 27.8 cubic feet of volume and the standard towing capacity is at a whopping 6,200 pounds.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I must admit that even if I am not too keen about these oversize SUV, they will give you an excellent ride on the highway. 

Driving within city streets can be a little tricky because of the oversize vehicle you are trying to steer around
narrow streets.
