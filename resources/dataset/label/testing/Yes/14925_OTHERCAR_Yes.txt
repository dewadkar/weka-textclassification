            The absolutely best thing about the Sony Mavica camera for the average user is the fact that it uses standard 3.5&quot; floppy disks. There is no need for adaptive peripherals in order to use your pictures. It even formats the disk, if necessary.

I originally purchased several of these for use in a teacher education program. They are used constantly by students and faculty, on PC's and Mac's, and like the little pink bunny, they keep on going.

Purchase includes the battery charger and software that's compatible with the two major platforms, PC and Mac. The camera has a zoom lens and built-in flash. It also has simple adjustments for the type of picture you are taking, e.g., outdoor, low light, etc. It even takes pictures in a sepia tone. It is simple to use, turns out good quality pictures in a variety of formats (JPEG, bitmap, etc.), and it reliable.

The price is a little higher than some home users would like, but it's convenience is worth it. <br><br>
