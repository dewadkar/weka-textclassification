            I've had this camera for 3 weeks and I love it.  I compared it to Olympus 2500l, 3000, Nikon Cool pix 950,  Kodak 280. I tried all these cameras and physically compared pix of the same subject.  The overall clarity and realistic color reproduction was the Sony.  The flash pix were really good as well.  Plus I like the time &amp; date stamp you can have placed on the pix when you take it.  The battery recharges right in the camera and seems to last about 2.0+ hours of constant use (Combo of pix and downloads)LCD off. There is a timer on the battery that tells you how long you have (in minutes) before the battery runs out. The USB download is pretty fast, I don't know why you would need to purchase any of the card readers that are sold by Sony but they are there.  I feel The menus are pretty easy to figure out once you understand Sony's logic.  They all had great features, I was more interested in pix quality than bells and whistles. 
Dislikes:  Shutter speed can be a little slow in dark/flash situations but picture quality makes up for it.  Buy the 64 meg memory card (highest available so far)the 8 will never workout if you want to take pix at a high resolution.  I bought an extra battery also just for vacation purposes.  The pix edit software is so-so, there is better on the market. The pix counter counts up to the max so you have to refer to the manual as to how many pix you could possibly squeeze in memory.  Other cameras calculate how many pix you can get in reference to the size of the memory
card and display a countdown.  No place to tie down lens cap, so i tied it to the shoulder strap.  Door/cover for USB port and AC cord could be more - heavy duty.
If your looking for a camera that takes great pix indoors and out in   auto mode and is easy to understand.   (The manual seems to be better written than the others also.) I would recommend this camera.
