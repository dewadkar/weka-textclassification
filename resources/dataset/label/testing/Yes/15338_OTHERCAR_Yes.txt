            All I can say after using this camera for a few days is WOW.  I love it.  It's so easy to use!  It takes great pictures and it is a lot of fun.   The battery lasts for a reasonably long time and you can take over 100 pictures on one battery.  Before buying any other digital camera, make sure you go and at least check this one out.  The features on the camera are second to none.<br><br>
