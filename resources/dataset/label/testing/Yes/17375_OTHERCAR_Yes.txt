            I fairly recently bought a pre-owned 1999 Eclipse GST (turbo, front-wheel drive) with about 45,000 miles.

In shopping for cars in this class, I looked at Acura's Integra and others, the Honda S2000, the Mitsubishi 3000GT, and pre-owned BMW 3-series coupes (in this price range, basically a '96-'99 323is/325Ci or possibly 328is/330Ci with more miles).  I had looked for pre-owned Supras and Mazda RX-7's, but the right one is incredibly difficult to find these days.

The first thing I did was shop around for insurance prices for these cars. Being a 2-seater, the S2000 was quite expensive to insure.  Technically 4-seaters, the others (including my car) were fairly similar in price except for the 3000GT (which is expensive to maintain, and I had heard bad stories about their reliability) and the BMW's, which were almost twice as expensive to insure.

I had heard only good things about the Eclipse -- from a variety of sources, both personal and industrial.  So I started looking for the right one;  as it happened, I found a pre-owned '99 turbo that had had work done to it.  I was able to purchase it at roughly blue book from a dealership, not including the work, which I would have wanted to do anyway: 18-inch alloy wheels, low-profile rubber, sport exhaust, sport 5-speed, and all of the GST's usual factory extras (sunroof, leather, decent sound system, etc.)

Before you think I am about to relate some kind of horror story, let me put your mind at ease:  I LOVE this car.  It is incredibly fun to drive (see some of the other car reviews I have written for samples of terrific cars in a higher class).  It is fast -- roughly on par with a newish Mustang GT (until very high speed, when the Mustang's more plentiful horsepower let it edge out a little).  Not as fast as a Supra, but definitely faster than most cars of a similar price.  The clutch took a little getting used to because it has been modified (I learned to drive stick in BMW's) but it and the factory trannies are very smoothe, very reliable -- no problems with that.  The only problem with delivering a peak of around 220hp (230 after mods) to only the front wheels is that at higher revs the wheels can spin in 1st or 2nd, and there is noticeable torque steer up to fairly high speeds.  Note that this really only applies to the turbo model -- the GS and RS are not very powerful, and easier to drive, making them great daily (commuter) cars with a sporty flair.  If you want the power and optimal handling, buy a GSX (AWD turbo) if you can find one!

In terms of handling, I have not yet done anything to the suspension, so that is all stock (except the tires, but they do not make an incredible difference, as they're starting to wear a little).  The car is definitely no BMW, but it's sure not a Ford, either - quite happily in between, in fact.  Driving the twisty part of Sunset Blvd. east of the 405 is the highlight of my day, but the car did fishtail ever so slightly in the rain once.  Being FWD, at least, giving it a little gas quickly pulled me back in line.  Sway is very minimal in tight corners (and torsional rigidity seems good), and for a while I wondered if perhaps the suspension had been tinkered with, but it's all stock, and pretty good evidence that Mitsubishi did their homework in designing an affordable sports car.  Just be aware that this car does not have a BMW or Benz-style traction control system!

Braking is a pretty similar story -- no BMW, but no real complaints either.  Being not as small and light as an S2000 or Z3, but actually fairly heavy, it will eat a little rubber on hard stops, and combined with FWD, the front tires take a beating.  Safety-wise, the Eclipse has dual airbags - pretty standard, nothing fancy - but seems very solid to drive (the advantage of a little weight).

The interior is perfect for the driver and nice for the front passenger.  The seats are very supportive and comfortable, visibility is very good, and the factory / stock version of the car is very easy to drive (especially with an auto transmission).  Stock models are fairly quiet, but have little squeaks here and there - again, not a luxury car, but a race car at heart.  Of course, mine is a bit harder, but harder to drive also means FUN to drive :)

At a price of around $16,900 I definitely got a pretty good deal, and have no regrets about buying the Eclipse.  The 60,000 mile servicing cost about $600 plus $300 for an optional timing-belt replacement, but these are pretty standard prices for the whole Mitsubishi line and a lot of Japanese cars.  No serious mechanical difficulties thus far (I've put more than 15,000 miles on the car in the last 9 months, and it takes the punishment quite admirably!)

All in all, not a BMW, but not BMW price, either.  Definitely the top of its class (i.e. Japanese sports cars in the sub-$30,000 class) and giving others runs for their money!  I plan to keep this car for at least 3 or 4 years, by which time hopefully I'll be able to pick up that M3 I've been lusting after...
