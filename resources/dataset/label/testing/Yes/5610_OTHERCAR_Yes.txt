            I bought my Mazda Protege 3 years ago.  I bought this car mainly for the price.  I really couldn't afford much more.  After 3 years I believe I made a very good choice.  I have had no problems with the car.  It now have 48K miles on it.  (There isn't even any of those little noises that drive you up the wall.)  
    I have gotten 40 miles to the gallon on long trips on the interstate.  The car is very good on gas.  It is a car for someone who drives a lot like my family.  
    If you need a dependable car at a low price, a Mazda Protege is what you are looking for.  I love my car.    <br><br>
