            Not just a &quot;Pretty Face&quot;!
Take it to Town in style-
Drive on Country roads with ease -
Durango answers individuals needs for traveling on Business in comfort and
a great performer! Traveling to schools; it accommodates 5 students.
Your daily shopping and errands makes your missions a pleasant
experience.
If you have ever experienced uncomfortable 
traveling in a Sports Utility Vehicle you will find
the driving and riding a comfort and pleasure. 
The competitors have more roughness - feeling each bump on the road.
The Durango handles those bumps with comfort.
It still is not the smooth ride of a expensive Car but, handles
rough highways with minimum tolerance.
Interior is well appointed with leather seats, easy controls.
The Durango meets all our needs.
Very pleased with this Dodge Sports Utility Vehicle -4x4 Durango.<br><br>
