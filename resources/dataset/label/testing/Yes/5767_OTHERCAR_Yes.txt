            I purchased this camera on a super sale, and only paid 265.00 for it. There were no directions, nor the disk for the driver. I downloaded it from their site.

PROS:

1. Very light compared to others that I was looking at.

2.This camera has a view finder that really comes in handy when you are in a bright light area. If you are out side, this really comes in handy becouse the LCD gets washed out.

3. Pluging the camera into the computer is really great. The USB connection is a bonus as well. If you are to take a number of pictures at any kind of resoultion, a serial port will take forever!!

4. The use of the auto focus is a plus, becouse if you are unable to see the LCD, it will adjust the picture for you. You can set the camera to manual if you wish to over ride the settings. Also a timer as well for including yourself in the picture.

5. Rechargeable battery with the battery base. Short recharge times as well.

CONS:

1. Battery life is not as long as I'd really like it to be. Yet this is not a professional camera as well. You might like to invest in another battery if you are to be out all day taking pictures.

2. COST. If I was to have purchased this camera for full price, I would have cried. Thats alot of $$ to spend on a digital camera that will probably be worth 1/2 that in 3 months.

3. Sometimes the auto focus dosent do such a great job as you'd have liked it to do. The digital zoom becomes a bit graney at the full zoom.

4. The menues are a bit to get accoustomed to. Once you get used to it tho, they become a bit easier.

OVERALL:

This is a really great 3.3 MG Pix camera if you can get it on sale. I didnt pay a whole lot for a 3.3 MG Pix camera, so I really was ahead of the game. You might like to try another before you go with such a large MG Pix camera and ask yourself if you really need a 3.3. It is a tad bit of over kill, but those that are looking to blow up their pictures up, I'd go with this here.
