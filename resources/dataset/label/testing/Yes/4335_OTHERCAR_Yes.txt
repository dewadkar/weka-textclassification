            Since this vehicle was last imported in '97, this is more a commentary for those thinking of picking up a used one (skip to the *** below for more technical info):

I got tired of sinking money into a used BMW 525 I probably shouldn't have bought in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, it was an awesome car and it made me look forward to taking long trips...I just couldn't afford a new one.  This car had more gremlins than the Ghostbuster movie I just saw this weekend for the first time in almost 20 years (can you believe it was made in 1984...ouch I'm getting old).  Anyway, each month was something new...ignition problems, timing problems, the main computer, the radio, and finally the transmission.  I had enough...and my wallet agreed.

I vowed that I would get the exact opposite of a BMW.  No more cars where everything was computerized.  My options were a pick-up (just right for Memphis...yee haa), a Jeep Wrangler (like every teenager), or this brutal machine at the Land Rover dealership that drives like a delivery truck.  It was more money than I wanted to spend, but I was single with no kids.  Go for it.

Almost 4 years later, I'm still in love with it.  I take it hunting and have yet to run into mud it won't plow through.  I still use it as an everyday vehicle.  It's not the best family car as far as space goes, but my 1 year-old loves to ride in it!  I'll never drive a car again.

***As far as technical things go, any problems I have had have been minor:  1)  A little corrosion that has been dealt with easily, 2)  Emission problems due to a recalled computer chip (no you can't go totally without computers), 3) Intermittent timing problems at 70 mph (same as above), and 4) Minor oil and power steering fluid leaks (all fixed under warranty).  5) The legroom is too short for me so I extended the seat rails (go to D90.com for the solution)Overall, pretty good for a Land Rover.

***Some noteworthy positive points:  1) I haven't had any problems with the soft top.  I only get wet when there's driving rain...and believe me it can be worse.  2)  The BF Goodrich All Terrain TA's ride very well on the highway and not too loud considering the tread.  3) Resale value still appears to be pretty good.  I've received offers to buy mine for 35K, but I refused.  Ebay shows the prices going for just under 30K...but try your local dealer for the going rate.
