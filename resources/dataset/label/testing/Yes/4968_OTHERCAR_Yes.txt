            I've been a car guy forever.  Had BMW's, Corvettes, Saabs, etc., etc., etc.  As I've gotten older, my tastes have changed toward more reasonable vehicles, ones which offer more than basic transportation, but less than ultra-performance, performance capabilities I only used in my mind.  

I chose the XG 300 not over its supposed competitors, the Camrys and Accords, but over Toyota's Avalon, the Mazda Millenia S, and other near-luxury cars in the $30k-+ range.  I drove each of the vehicles on extended test drives, in all sorts of traffic conditions, all sorts of roads, charged hard, cruised easy.  At the end, it was no contest.  

Hyundai designed this car to confuse the public.  Most folks think it's either a Jag, a Lincoln, or an Infiniti.  I don't view this as a positive thing.  The car's exterior styling is derivative and conservative (one of my best friends said he felt...&quot;Rotarian&quot;...in it).  Eventually Hyundai will have enough confidence to make its own statement.

But.  I don't see the exterior when I am behind the wheel.  I see the well-laid out instrument panel, the easily reached stereo and climate control buttons and knobs, the road ahead, the road behind.  Seating position is excellent; comfortable for hours on the road; infinitely adjustable; manual lumbar adjustment is a BIG plus.

But.  The visual experience, in and out of the car, mean nothing to the hands, the feet, the body, as one is transported.  This is by no means a hot rod sports sedan, but it comports itself with aplomb in any normal driving situation, up to and including rapid driving on twisty roads.  Push it too hard, and it squawks, but pushing too hard is not what one does with a car such as this.  Point it and it goes, quietly, smoothly, no muss, no fuss.  A Millenia S will do the same, but with more thumping and carrying on about the adventure.  An Avalon will do the same, but one never gets away from the feeling that underneath, the Avalon is really a slightly refined Buick, pillowy ride and all.

Though not quite as powerful as some of the other cars in the same size class, not to mention the &quot;higher&quot; class I compared it to, the car accelerates with enough alacrity to merge into any crowded freeway.  The Shiftronic &quot;gimmick&quot; turns out to be quite handy in situations requiring a quick bump to the speedometer reading.

Perceived quality of fit and finish is equal to or better than the class I compared it to.  I didn't look at the Camrys or Accords, but presume they are similar in quality.

The Koreans are as much in love with myriad gadgets as the Japanese.  The L model I purchased has memory seats, heated seats (pah!, I thought; in Texas? I'm addicted already), full auto climate control, traction control, leather everything, except what's faux burl wood, &quot;pushbutton&quot; drink holder hideyholes, ashtrays, multiple power outlets (turn off when the ignition's off, downer for charging the cell phone).  Mirrors which automatically turn down when you put the car in reverse...thankfully you can disable this feature.  And much more.

Headroom in a sunroof car has always been a bone of contention for me, and one of the reasons I looked at the tophat-looking Avalon.  After a bit of fiddling with the memory seat controls, I gave the XG the same score.

On the technical bits side, all you could ask for is there.  The question, of course, is do the bits work together?  DOHC 3-liter, Shiftronic (think Porsche Tiptronic) transmission, independent suspension, fabulous four-wheel ABS discs, attractive alloys wearing Michelin V-rated tires, traction control.  The answer tothe question is &quot;Yep, they do&quot;.  Don't expect to keep up with a Corvette, but do expect to learn to enjoy a new experience if you are used to high performance cars:  quiet, luxurious, well-balanced high speed driving.  Or exceedingly civilized low speed driving.

The last thing is the best thing:  the incredible 5/60 Bumper to Bumper warranty, the 10/100 powertrain warranty, and the 5 years worth of roadside assistance.  You won't miss not having OnStar.  I've had another Hyundai, and the warranty service was always excellent.

Although this thing exudes &quot;Rotary Club&quot; as my friend put it, the price, the quality, the warranty, and most of all, the driving experience, made the choice, for me, a no-brainer.  Remember, I compared it to an Avalon:  $32k and change for comparable equipment; a Milennia S: $31k and change for comparable equipment.

Hyundai has a reputation for low quality nightmares, a holdover from the days of the unlamented Excel.  In 1993 the company began to improve quality in earnest, and this latest flagship model is the result.  My old '93 Sonata with a hundred thousand miles is still on the road, in the hands of a friend's kid, with only the sort of maintenance one would expect for a car of that mileage.  My daughter's 95 Sonata has about 80,000 miles, and has only had normal scheduled maintenance, and a couple of interior issues like busted door latch covers.  Bad reps follow for a long, long time, long after the situation has changed.  

Hyundai missed their target with this car.  They overshot the Camry and Accord and Maxima, and hit the next level square amidships.  

One more thing:  if you already have a Hyundai, or a relative does, you get a $1,500 rebate.  Whee!  I upgraded to the L model!  My daughter's Sonata paid off again!.

For almost ten grand less than the AvalonMilennia cars of the world, I can afford the Rotary Club dues.  Just be thankful Hyundai gave it a stupid set of numbers and letters, rather than calling it the Grandeur, as they do in other world markets.

UPDATE:  Since writing this review, I have put 2000 miles on the car, lots of highway travel, lots of city driving.  A six hour drive at highway speeds (78mph in Texas)was not tiring, the cruise control didn't surge like some other makes, the ABS brakes literally saved my life on a wet highway when a big truck sudddenly switched lanes...the ABS simply made the car slow down RIGHT NOW, with no muss, no fuss.  A nine hour day in the car, working in a big city, driving, used to wear me out in my former car (a Suburban).  The Hyundai left me not refreshed, but not hammered, either. I usually go to the local stereo shop after owning a car for a couple of weeks, and add on $1,500 or so in amps and speaker upgrades and stuff.  I'm only wishing the Hyundai had a changer, and I can live without that. The factory stereo system is clean, crisp, and clear.

All is not perfect living in Grandeur, however.  The automatic AC, as is the case in almost any car I can think of, drives me crazy.  It never seems to heat up or cool down fast enough, and is always fiddling with fresh air here, warm air there.  I prefer using it in manual mode.  I will say that Hyundai had the good sense to provide fresh, unheated air through the top side vents when the heat is on, so your feet are toasty and your face gets fresh air, keeping you from getting drowsy.  I first encountered this in a 1970 BMW, and have always thought it should be required on all vehicles.  I don't like the location of the steering wheel-mounted cruise control buttons, but I'm left handed.  

Hyundai should follow others' lead with their remote keyless entry, and have a setting which unlocks only the driver door.

And finally, the BIG complaint:  there's a little plastic doohickey which snaps together to hold the floor mat in place, and it's always coming undone.  Very annoying.  I'll consider the solution (a zip tie should do it) a very small price to pay for a car which offers so much, much more than the price competition.

My wife, by the way, drives a little new Malibu, which, until I bought the XG, was a perfectly nice, quiet little car.  Compared to the XG, it sounds like a tank.  The only clue that the Hyundai motor is running at idle is the tachometer.

Last tidbit:  I made a deal at 3% over invoice, and then the dealer took another $300 off that at the end.  And of course, I got the rebate mentioned earlier.  Out the door, tax, title, license, was a few bucks over $24,000.00.  For the L model.  Go get one.
