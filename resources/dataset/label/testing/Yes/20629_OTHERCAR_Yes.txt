            There are very few cars out there like the 1982 Toyota Corolla-Tercel, and this goes farther than just it's slightly unusual looks right into it's slightly unusual engineering.
I picked up my bright yellow Corolla-Tercel from the original owner, for the lofty sum of $600, that included a car cover and a ski rack (the combined value of which probably exceeds that of the car)which was a good deal.
Since then it's gotten me from point A to point B and back again with minimal trouble and averaged 45mpg.
Like most old Toyota cars it's dead slow, I'll be lucky to be moving faster than 40mph by the time I enter the highway from the on-ramp, and it's got more than it's fair share of gear whine and if you're not careful the brakes will lock up in the rain - those are my only complaints.
Otherwise it's a great car, the doors are big, the seats are comfy, it's easy to park, the handling is excellent for a car of this era - and it's easy to work on.
It'll go through snow and ice better than most eco-box cars and it looks different (which depending on how you think about it can be a good or bad thing)
The engine is not mounted transversely as it is on most front wheel drive cars, so it's easy to change the oil filter or replace sparkplugs by yourself.
All in all a fun to drive, aging economy car well worth the $600 I payed for it.
(please note that while this review is of a 1982 tercel, the biggest difference between '82 and '83 is just styling)
