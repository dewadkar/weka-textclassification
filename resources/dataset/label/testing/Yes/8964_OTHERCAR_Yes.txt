            because I didn't.

Mercury Topaz is always referred to as a good deal, well I bought it used and didn't get a good deal, even though I got it from fleet rental company, it started falling apart shortly after I purchased it.  With gasoline proces soaring I was hoping to get good gas mileage, well forget it, with all the problems and old parts this Topaz is eating gas just like any new SUV, about 15 mpg.  I ended up spending more on parts then what I paid for the car itself at the dealership and consider this the worst investment that I ever made.  It runs now with squeeks and leaks and every month gets some problem that costs $200-$300.  I wish I would get a new car and pay it off because I pay for repairs more than for monthly payments for a new car.  

Topaz delivers low if no performance, it takes forever to get up to speed on the road and on the freeway it's as noisy as it gets with a cheap 3-speed automatic, at 60 mph it sounds as it will blow up. 

I just don't like the way tis car hadles and drives, if you are lookin for a good used car around $3000-$5000, consider staying away from Ford Motor Company cars, find yourself a used Saturn or Dodge, you'll get a better deal.<br><br>
