            The Honda Accord LX is a practical car but its engine is lacking. The Accord is a modest and mediocre car. 

The major flaw of this car is its engine capability. For 135 horses it sure is slow in the acceleration department. When you stomp on the gas when you see a yellow light, the car just doesn't give you that extra kick immediately. Although the engine is relatively quiet and smooth, when i drive the car I am just craving for more power.

The Accord is comfortable to drive dont get me wrong. Although not as spacious as a Camry, the Accord is sufficient. The car is basically a practical car. Its great for long trips but driving the car can be a bore at times. The Camry has comparably the same amount of horsepower but its acceleration is a lot better than the Accord. 

If you are interested in a modest practical car, the Accord LX is for you. I have had very little mechanical problems so its a plus in that department. <br><br>
