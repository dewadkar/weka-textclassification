            Many car makers promise value and affordability, Kia delivers.  The new Kia Spectra offers a lot of car, for a bargain price.  Although the Spectra is mechanically identical to the slightly mundane Sephia. The 5-door GSX package gives you a surprisingly well equipped, and a surprisingly useful car that is also fun to drive.

Inside, the GSX is not much different than many other compact cars � lots of plastic. However, the quality of the interior seems more like a mid priced Japanese car than a budget minded Korean brand. Leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter are unheard of at under $15,000. Cloth seats are firm and comfortable, with enough adjustment options to keep even the crankiest of drivers happy. Rear seating space is excellent, adults in the 6 ft range fit comfortably, and have plenty of leg room.  Back seats have a 60/40-split function, resulting in more useable cargo space than most other compact cars. The rear hatch door opens high and wide, making even more useable cargo space than other cars with a normal trunk.  Dashboard layout lacks the ergonomic perfection found on most Japanese brands, but most buttons and switches are an easy reach for the driver. A digital clock adds to the overall feeling of quality inside the GSX.

On the road the GSX is nimble and even peppy.  Kia�s inline 4 produces a class leading 125 hp.  Around town and on the highway, the engine is smooth and relatively quiet (for a 4 cylinder).  Handling is precise and even somewhat sporty.  On the open road the Spectra feels smooth without that irritating �floaty� feeling.  Brakes are average.  Rear drum brakes are low point, especially considering the sporty pretensions  of the GSX package.  

Overall the Kia Spectra GSX is a sporty, useful and affordable alternative to some Japanese brands.  With options such as A/C, cloth seats, cruise control, power outside mirrors, and split folding rear seats, the Spectra is a great value.  You will get more car for less money, at $13,900 the Spectra is about $4000 less than other cars in it�s class. The only question mark is long-term reliability � Kia�s 100,000 mile warranty should help lessen the worry.

Compare the Kia Spectra GSX to:

Toyota Corolla -      Kinda Boring - Reliable but Expensive
Hyundai Accent -      Not as Sporty - Great Price
Ford Focus -           Worthy Alternative
Daewoo Nubira -        Great Price
Kia Sephia -            Similar
Honda Civic -           You Get What You Pay For
