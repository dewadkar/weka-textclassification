            I currently own a 1995 Nissan Altima with a sunroof and rear spoiler, this vehicle was one of the most superb purchases that I have made.  My reasoning for going after this car was simple, my previous automobile was a Ford Explorer and it was extremely terrible (see my epinion on Ford Explorers).  I had to go after a foreign car and that brought me to the Nissan Altima.  I wanted a car that would be reliable and easy on the gas budget, I got that with the Altima.

The best feature of this vehicle is what I have already mentioned, its reliability.  I'm going on one year of owning this great car and I've had no problems, knock on wood.  The seats are very comfortable and I don't mind taking long trips because of this comfort.  The ride is smooth and unlike my Explorer, very quiet. Another great thing about buying the Altima is that these vehicles hold their value for when it's time to purchase another car. The only problem that I have encountered is the alignment has been going off lately.

For anyone who wants an affordable economy car, give the Nissan Altima a look.  Its great for those that have a family or for those, like me, who don't feel like throwing your money away at a garage shop. Overall, this is a car that I would fell comfortable taking on long trips and not worrying about problems along the way.<br><br>
