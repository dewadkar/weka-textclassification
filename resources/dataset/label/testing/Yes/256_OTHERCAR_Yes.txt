            It really needs a filter thread so that a filter can be installed to protect the lens. 

In the auto mode, the combination of aparture and speed produces grainy pictures under the shade or evening light. 

Optical view finder doesn't produce the "what you see is what you get" picture, it truncates views. 

With a 340mb microdrive, it must took a few seconds to start up. 

Sometimes, it flashes "CF" messages, and needs to turn it on and off several times to get rid of it.

Picture quality in general is good, but it always give you a feeling that the picture is not focused well when you look at them.

The LCD is the best part of the camera. It's bright and viewable even under the sun.

The battery is enough for one day's shooting (100-200 pictures). Wish it has an option for an external battery source with a higher capacity.
