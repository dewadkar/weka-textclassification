            I bought a 2000 Ford Escort ZX2 last month from Vista Ford in Woodland Hills, CA.  I had a great experience at this dealership, compared to the other two Ford dealers I visited in the area.  The salesman sold me on the automatic version of the ZX2 because, Hey, it's LA, who wants to be doing all that clutch and shift stuff in LA traffic????

I have loved my car since I took it off the lot.  So far the car seems to run well.  It has a nice engine, although a little more power to get more speed on steep grades would be nice.  I have driven 4000+ miles in the short time I have owned this car and LOVE to drive it.  The seats are comfortable, the stereo is acceptable, the size is perfect.  The car handles well on tight turns at high speeds and fits in small parking spaces.  It can zip in and out of traffic, cuts people off with minimal space.  On numerous occasions, the car has exceeded 100 miles, with passengers as well as driver not noticing the excessive speed.  Most cars shake at or around 95, but the ZX2 just keeps on going.  

The only complaints I have are that the passenger window squeaks when it is rolled down.  My laziness has allowed this to persist for the past month.  If anyone else has this problem on their ZX2, let me know.  I'm interested to see if it's just my car or if it's just the ZX2.  The stereo is OK, but it could be better.  My car has the base 4 speaker, cassete stereo, which is OK, but if you really want a system that kicks, then go for an aftermarket version...

All in all, the car is a great buy.  I got mine fully loaded for $14000, not bad for a first time car buyer.<br><br>
