            I bought my MX-700 last March. As it was my second digital camera from Fuji, I guess I�d classify myself as a user with intermediate experience. However, it was a big step up for me.
The camera is small, sleek and sexy.  Only slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes, it fits in a breast pocket, easily. The polished aluminum case gives it a rugged, yet stylish look that incites envy among friends and strangers.
The picture quality is simply stunning. The 1280 X 1024 resolution provides photos that rival 35-mm slides in color definition and amount of detail. With the right printer, using glossy photo paper, the results are impossible to tell from film photographs. A friend, using his Epson printer made a print of a photo taken inside the oldest cathedral in the city. The stained glass figures are breathtaking and the intricate patterns of leaded glass fill the page.
The lithium-ion battery is small, powerful and can be charged at any time. The included AC Adapter charges the battery without having to remove it from the camera. The MX-700 comes with cables for both PC and MAC, but I would recommend buying a Flashpath Floppy-Disk Adapter for an extra $75. The download is simpler and quicker as the computer �sees� only a disk in the �A� Drive, and acts accordingly as photos are clicked-and-dragged into a folder on the desktop.
On the downside, the flash is weak and good for only 8.2 feet. �Forcing� it offers an improvement, but not much. The digital zoom is a joke, and the unit comes with only a 2 MB Smart Media card. Two megabytes will only hold 2 pictures, at the highest resolution. I purchased extra 8 MB cards at about $30 each. Sixteen and thirty-two megabyte cards are also available now.
I feel the design of the Fuji MX-700 is thoughtful and practical. Its functions are well laid-out and not clumsy to operate for someone with big hands, like myself. The 2-inch LCD screen previews the images for your consideration. 
Originally priced at $799, I paid $440 for mine and have seen them on the Internet for $399. All in all, I�m developing a brand loyalty for Fuji. I think you�ll like it, too.
