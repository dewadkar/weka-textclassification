            <b>How it all started</b>
First I have to say in general I hate cars, and really hate two door cars. I am use to driving SUV, so when I dropped off my Suburban at the dealer to get some work done on it, I requested a loaner vehicle. When they drove up with the Grand AM I was disappointed.

<b>The test drive</b>
I had the car for about a week and put 500 miles on it. More that I drove it the more that I liked it. It has pickup for a L4 engine, the gas mileage was great, it was roomy and ride was fair.

This vehicle was a low level SE, but did come with A/C, power locks, fog lights, day time running lights, traction control, and ABS. The seat were comfortable and firm, the way I like it. The dash layout is great and includes a tach, speed, gas, temp, and a electronic mileage and trip readout. All of he car controls are within easy reach of the driver.

The engine is a 2.4 L4 that has plentity of power for that size of car. It runs 2100 RPM at 70MPH and get into the high 20's in gas mileage. 

The trunk is very large and easy to get into. The car is very roomy itself. The front is wide open to fit about any size person. The back, though it looks small, it not all that bad. If you are more than 5 10&quot; then your head may hit the car roof.

The ride are fair and leaves room for improvement. It did not rattle your filling out of your mouth, but it let your know that the road has bumps. Also the car came with a traction control features that locks both the front wheels to give your more traction in slick conditions.

<b>It has a few problems too</b>
Now I have drove two different Grand AM's, both were 1999's. The silver one had 31600 miles on it, and the green one that I picked up today has 32150 miles on it. They both suffer from the same problem. 

The radio has a problem with the display. The numbers it messed up and you can't read the time or what station that you are on. This has happened to both cars, and it seems to come and go as it please.

When you hit bumps on the road, both cars make terrible noises up in the front. It sound like sheet metal bouncing lose in the front.

<b>Overall...</b>
I really like this car. I thought that I would not but I is a nice affordable car. I would recommend that car to someone has has a small family who wants a nice car without the big price tag. I wouldn't recommend this car to a person who wants a very fast performer, unless you get the V6.<br><br>
