            My husband and I live in the Washington DC suburbs (read: terrible traffic all year around, *especially* when the weather is bad). Last year, after a major ice storm kept us stranded for two days, we decided to get a SUV.  Having previously owned another Dodge product (1995 Neon) and having been very pleased with it, we decided to see what Dodge had to offer.

We fell in love with the Durango almost immediately.  We got to test drive it on an icy/snowy parking lot and it handled great.  We ended up purchasing a used 1998 model with approx 17k miles on it.  We love love love it.  It's great in heavy traffic due to its great handling.  You do have to be careful when cornering (not too fast!) and make sure to allow enough braking time...this behemoth does NOT stop on a dime!

I don't know how well this truck would do in true off-road conditions, but here in the 'urban jungle' it does great.  It accelerates quickly, has excellent handling, deals well with muddy or icy conditions, and is comfortable for long trips.  Last summer I was rear-ended at low speed by a Honda Civic, and I literally did not feel it.

After we had owned the Durango for a few months, the front power windows started misbehaving.  This problem was fixed at the dealership under warranty, and seems to have stayed fixed. 

Technically, there is seating for 8 adults in this vehicle since we have the optional rear bench seat.  However, the most we have been able to fit in with reasonable comfort is 6. If we were to put 8 adults in there, the 6 in the back would be pretty cramped! There are cupholders everywhere!  Another nice feature is the separate rear climate control so the back seats can have air conditioning or heat independent of the front seats.

We got cloth seats, but leather is available for those who want it.  We also got the radio/cassette stereo system (no CD player) which seems to work very well.  It has a nice sound to it.

It was a bit tricky at first for me to fold the collapsing rear bench, but now I can do it with ease. I like being able to haul large items without concern about them being exposed to the elements during the trip.

One feature that I wish we had gotten was the collapsing side mirrors.  I call them Whack-em Mirrors.  These mirrors fold in so in case you scrape against a wall (or a McDonald's ordering speaker), the mirrors just fold in and are not damaged.  

We love our Durango. I would definitely recommend this car to a friend.
