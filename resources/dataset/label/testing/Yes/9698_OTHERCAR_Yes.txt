            I figured it was time to grow up.  Being single I've always had convertibles and 2 doors...now I wanted something a little more conventional, a lot more luxurious but still fun to drive.  

Test drove the Infiniti G35, Cadillac CTS, Lexus ES 300, Jaguar X-Type and previously owned and new BMW and Mercedes models whose numbers I can't remember.  Why didn't I think of Acura??  Lack of memorable advertising perhaps?  

I'm in radio sales and the local dealer was on my client list.  On a sales visit (he turned me down again...doesn't believe in radio) I said "what the heck"....and test drove a 2003 Acura TL.  Wow...was I blown away.  Great performance, comfortable interior, sumptuous leather, best sounding (actually "accurate" sounding is a better word)sound system of the bunch, quiet ride, superior handling,  and a price that had me looking twice.  I actually didn't faint!  The salesman at the dealership was very knowledgeable and pressure-free, which I appreciated.

The interior and controls are well thought out.  Acura made me feel smart because I could work the radio and CD Changer without reading the manual.  Same with the power windows. If you want the windows to go up, you pull up...down, push down.  Pretty simple, huh?  Some of the other auto makers should make things so easy. Retained power when you shut off the ignition is a welcome touch.

Luxury abounds everywhere,  High grade interior materials, visor vanity lights that only go on when the headlights are in use. A trunk cargo net is standard too.  The only factory option is the navigation system.  I saved $2,000 by buying the new Rand-McNally Atlas for $2.95 at Wal-Mart.  Works just as good and it's easier to use. 

A/C comes on instantly even if the car has been baking in the Southwest Florida sun all day.  No more hot air in your face. My salesman informed me Acura shares a special system with Mercedes that electrically cools the air and gets it to you quick. I wasn't able to confirm this, so I did my own test. I can tell you that when you turn the A/C on in any other new luxury car except the Mercedes or Acura you'll get 30 seconds of hot air blowing at you until things cool down. 

The Acura 3.2 TL had everything that I wanted except for the "lights on at dusk" feature, but it does have those Xenon lights which some other brands make you pay extra for.  

The Acura 3.2 TL is loaded and some of the stuff I'll never use, especially living here in Southwest Florida, like the 2 way heated seats.  I thought I would never use the heated mirrors, but I have.  On a foggy day with heavy dew it just cleans the side view mirrors right up.  Plus the right mirror angles down when you go into reverse so you can park better.  

There's one touch memory seat and outside mirror position settings for two drivers.  You can recall the memory from the buttons on the door or from your remote door opener.  Nice touch.  The car is pretty near perfect for me, save for those "luggage crusher" trunk lift thingies.  Come on, Acura, even Hyundai installs those nice hydraulic arms!

There's 12 volt power everywhere, with outlets behind the shifter and at the bottom of the console, which has a nice green courtesy light at night.  Talking about the center console, which is a convenient 2 tiered deal, they seem to have a tendency to pop open when you hit a bump.  My dealer apparently received many complaints about this and had no solution.  After having the console pop open a few times when the car was driven over a rough surface I solved the problem by taking a piece of black electrical tape and applying it to the lip of the console.  It now works perfectly.

Being able to manually shift the transmission will keep you entertained on a challenging road.  

When bad weather hits you'll be glad you have front wheel drive. Acura's ABS and TCS make you feel very safe. 

Moonroof operation is smooth, seals up nice, and there is no wind noise from anywhere.  While some drivers may have a problem with the Moonroof controls, on the dash to the left of the steering wheel, I think it's fine.

You can program the HomeLink system to open the gate to your community, your garage door and turn on your house lights (if you have an X-10 system or the like).  I was concerned that the HomeLink wouldn't work with my 11 year old Sears garage door opener because the remote uses an older system, but it worked just fine.  The system in the Jaguar X-Type that I test drove for a weekend wouldn't take the code.  The Acura's system is easy to program as well.  No more looking for that remote!  

You can hold a convention in the rear with seating for 3.  Nice fold down console with drink holders and adjustable A/C vents make the back seat experience pleasant.  

Haven't used the trunk pass through feature yet, but it seems handy.  Really didn't want a fold down seat, sort of prevents you from loading up stuff that doesn't belong in a luxury car.   

I was able to impress my girlfriend, co-workers and boss (who now thinks I'm earning way too much for what I do) without major changes to my budget. 

My insurance actually went DOWN from what I was paying on a base 1998 Mustang Convertible even though I INCREASED my coverage...thank you Geico!  The only options I put on were the mud-guards (with a black wheel well lip, which actually makes the car, in Naples Gold, look pretty cool) and the hard trunk liner, which at first I thought was useless.  If you carry around weird stuff (like food trays full of Kielbasa to a radio remote) it'll save the trunk carpeting from absorbing sauerkraut juice and the like. I also added a Gold Emblem package.

I feel the negative comments I've read about the exterior styling doesn't apply to the 2002 and 2003 TL's.  They're basically timeless designs, and those of us who own one will find that out at trade in time.  You'll like the redesigned tail lamps of the 2003 as well.  Auto-Dimming rear view mirror is excellent.  Quality of the carpet is the same or better as cars costing $20,000 more.  

One note on the sound system. It is designed by Bose, which if you're familiar with their products, you know they like to do things a bit differently.  There are separate amplifiers in each of the doors and 1 in the trunk to run the speakers.  If your instincts are to crank up the bass, think again.  It will make the system sound muddy.  This is true of all Bose systems, including their famous WAVE Radio. Optimum bass on a Bose system is when it's run flat.  Adjust your treble up, and listen to the system come alive.  

I raved about this car so much my brother, who lives 1,800 miles away, bought a 2003 CL...and he loves his car too! 
 
All in all, if you don't load the trunk up too much on the sides and you remember to turn the lights on at night, this is a near perfect automobile!! 

This is a review of my Acura 3.2 TL.  The box below says it's a 2002 model, but when you write the review at this time you can't select 2003 as a model year on this site.
