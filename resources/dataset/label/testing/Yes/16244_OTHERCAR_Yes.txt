            I had to replace my car fast,quick and cheap. Looked at all the small cars and bought the Corolla.  It rides smoother than my husbands ford explorer and the gas mileage is great.The car handles much better than others in it class and is easy to get in and out of tight spots.  Also for those of you like me in the shorter than average range you can see backing up, not always true in other makes and modes - had trouble seeing out in Civic and protege.  If they would only fix those drink holders it would be flawless. Have put 11,000 miles on in 6 months still runs like day one I love it. <br><br>
