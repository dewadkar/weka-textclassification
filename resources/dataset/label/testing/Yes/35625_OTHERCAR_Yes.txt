            We've had our Malibu for a little over a year. We purchased it as a program car. It now has 50,000 miles on it, and all we've done is change the oil. This is a very reliable family vehichle. It has six cylinders, dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, power everything and it is spacious enough for five. This is a four door car with a large trunk and a remote release. The back doors offer child safety locks, as well as window lockout . This is a great car for the money, under $20,000. You have the option to purchase an extended 100,000 mile warranty. I highly recommend always doing that. I can honestly say that this is a very comfortable and very economic car. Oh yes, did I mention that the radio is speed sensitive? What a concept! I highly recommend the Chevrolet Malibu to anyone looking for a moderate mid-sized family vehichle.<br><br>
