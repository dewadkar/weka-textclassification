            My wife chose a 98 Sportage shortly after her previous car was totalled in an accident. She wanted a 4X4, but did not want a huge SUV. At the time, we compared the Honda CR-V and the Isuzu models, and chose the Kia because of its value for the money. Nowhere else could we find true 4X4 (with shift-on-the-fly) that came *standard* with air conditioning, power windows, power locks, an alarm, and an in-dash CD player. Heck, my 2000 BMW 323i didn't come standard with an in-dash CD!

In the value for the dollar, there was absolutely no beating the Kia. Out the door for around $17k with all of those features, and an &quot;honest to goodness&quot; truck to boot - the Sportage reflects its jungle heritage, and that may be its biggest downfall.

The Sportage rides like a truck, handles like a truck, and accelerates like the underpowered truck that it is at heart. I'm sure it was a cost-cutting move, but the four-cylinder engines that Kia is using in the Sportage are just horrible, providing absolutely no torque or any kind of push at all off the line. This little truck goes, but it goes at its own leisurely pace, thank you very much. 

But then, in the world of skyscraper-sized SUV's and rolling theater minivans, the Sportage is what it says it is -- a *real* 4X4 for less than $20k. And if you're looking for just that, you won't be disappointed.

Some surprises awaited us after we drove off the lot, though: first, we noticed that even though things like an in-dash CD player and power windows were standard, intermittent wipers and cruise control are *not* - we took the intermittent wipers for granted (assuming that all cars had them these days) and were surprised by it. As for the cruise, that's an option on many cars, so was not missed as much. Also, as you might expect on a cheap car, the materials used inside are pretty cheap as well - the plastic is brittle, the cloth thin, and the buttons fragile. 

One last word - we have experienced nothing but STELLAR service from our dealer. Our truck has had several bits of warranty work done, including complete replacement of the radio/CD unit, replacement of the front carpeting after an A/C hose clogged, and even replacement of a scratched glovebox door. All of these were done without the slightest bit of grousing or argument, and done pleasantly and quickly.

All in all, if you set your expectations properly, the Sportage will not disappoint. I don't know if we will ever buy another Kia product again, but at the time we chose the Sportage, it was the perfect blend of features and price.<br><br>
