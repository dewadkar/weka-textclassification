            I'll be honest, I'm a Saturn partisan. Between my wife's cars and my own, I've now driven Mercury cars, Fords, Chevrolets, Renaults, GMCs and Hondas. I can say without reservation that I love my Saturn, and wouldn't trade it for anything (in this price class, to be fair). On the strength of my recommendation, my wife, brother, sister, mother, stepmother and college roommate have all bought Saturns, and been well-pleased.

So what makes it so great?

The very, very best thing isn't even the car...it's the company. I dreaded buying another car, but going into the Saturn dealership was a genuine, and unexpected, pleasure. I was treated courteously, and never pressured. When I later moved to a new city 100 miles away, the dealership I bought from arranged with the dealership in my new town to finish out my special warranty service...no hassle for me. I've been treated well at all four dealerships where I've done business, always been given a fair deal, and always felt welcome. That means worlds to me when I'm spending $15K or so with a company.

The car itself has been spectacular. I have just over 130K miles on it (a baby step by Saturn standards). I've put two alternators in it now, but that seems to be a karmic thing with me and automobiles. (Word of advice...let the dealership replace these things...I did the first one, and it was a pain.) Other than that and regular maintenance, I've not had to put a dime in extra money into this car. Runs like a top.

The road noise is a bit loud, but more recent models have changed that problem. Also, the pins that hold the interior plastic trim to the frame seem to break off and loosen the trim. I've thought about replacing it, but it hasn't been bad enough to be worth doing. My only other gripe is the seat, which after all this mileage and lots of long trips, has broken down some. I'm probably going to replace the lower half soon.

If you buy a Saturn and have the chance, go to the Homecoming in Spring Hill. The factory is incredible. They make almost everything there. That's another plus for me...the car is made right here in the country. I had the option to buy a similarly-equipped Honda, and although the Honda's ride was a little better, the overall package of the Saturn was more attractive and cheaper by almost $2000.

The fact is, I can't say enough good things about Saturn--the company or the cars. Both have treated me very, very well over the last eight years.
