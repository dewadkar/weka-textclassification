            This is my second Land Rover (please see my 1996 review). I enjoyed my 1996 Discovery so much I knew I would get the new Series II when it cam out. 
The new one has definitely improved. I feel the Series II is much more refined in it's ride (suspension &amp; road feel), and the engine seems to have more low end torque and better response. Even though I believe Horsepower has not changed. That is really my only complaint. I think that a car in the price range should have more horsepower, especially when you look at the competition.
However, I am totally satisfied withe everything else. The interior and exterior were cleaned up a bit, and there is a little more room in the cargo area.
As I mentioned in my 1996 Disco review, the car is superb off road, nothing compares. On road I feel that the Series II is a major improvement for everyday comfort. I have three young boys, who are very active in sports. They also ride Dirt bikes, which we use the Discovery to tow a large trailer to carry it all. The Discovery performs all of these tasks well. It has a reputation for being expensive, but look at all of the other SUV's out there and you will see that it is competitively priced. Once again I have to say, I wouldn't own any other Sport Utility for my family's active life style.
Their Customer Service remains the BEST in the Auto industry today. <br><br>
