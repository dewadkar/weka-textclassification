            I've had my '91 Protege for over 3 years now.  It has been fairly reliable -- I only had to change brake pads (however, front disks needed changing too, because the pads didn't release all the way and caused the rotors to heat up and get warped) and exhaust system pieces.  Regarding the out of the ordinary repairs, there was just one: my radiator blew (cracked from overheating) on the strip at Hampton Beach in NH, because the fan sensor didn't work and the fan didn't kick in when engine coolant got hot enough.  Lesson learned: maintain your car.

As far as pros go handling is the first thing that comes to mind.  The steering feel is just as good as in an in an 2000 Audi A4 (which I test drove a few months ago), and that is saying much!  The roadholding, which really benefits from the extra-soft, extra-grippy Bridgestone Pontenzas, has always impressed my friends.  When the car does begin to slip due to hard cornering, sliding out on all 4 is actually quite controllable and predictable, and the steering remains communicative at all times.

I certainly didn't expect this much performance out of a 9-year-old japanese eonobox.

I own the 125-hp LX model (5-speed). The engine has plenty of torque at low rpm.  In fact it is very drivable at 1000 rpm at low speeds in the first 3 gears.  High-ratio (short) gearing helps in the acceleration department, adn passing on the highway does not require downshifting.  The engine does however rev at 3000 rpm at a mere 60 mph.  Top speed-wise, I've accelerated past 100 mph (once) and there was still plenty of oomph left...

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how this particular cookie crumbles... I am now out of college and working at a .com making enough money to buy a new BMW, but I love my Protege and will drive it into the ground.
