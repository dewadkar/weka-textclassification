            The Honda Accord by far is the most dependable car I have ever owned.  After two years of frequent driving, this car has held up very well.  I have only needed to bring the car in for oil changes so far.  The Accord is a very comfortable car and features a nice soft ride.  I find that driving this car on long trips isn't a hassle.  

For only $22,000,  the Accord has many great features.  Leather seating and a CD changer give the Accord a nice luxury feel.  The engine is a  V6, giving the car a powerful, yet comfortable ride.  The room that the Accord provides is well adequate for a sedan.  The trunk is surprisingly large.  However, if more room in the trunk is needed, the back seats fold down as well.  A handy device are the cup holders in both front and back.  Strong Michelin tires and an ABS system are quite useful in bad weather conditions. 

The only downside to this Accord is miles/gallon.  Accords without the strong V6 engine feature higher miles/gallon.  If you are in the running for a new sedan, I would definitely consider the Honda Accord.  You are unquestionably getting your money's worth, and a highly dependable car as well.  I recommend this car to anyone looking for luxury at an affordable price.
