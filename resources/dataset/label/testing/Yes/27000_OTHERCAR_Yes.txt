               One:...Why did I buy this Olympus D-450 Zoom Camera?  Well I went to my sales friend first. He suggested several cameras out of my price range and I went home ready to live with my 35 mil.. Than I used another friend's digital. it was my first time out with a digital in hand. Wow! 60 pictures! Great viewer! No more surprises! I went back to my sales friend---we hashed over specs. Was I going to do a lot of camera to hard copy work? No---ok for good as you'll ever need Web pics--at or under five hundred hard earned bucks? With a 3X zoom? and a standard big storage disc? (not 60 but 122 pics) One camera only! The OLYMPUS D-450Zoom!

   Two:...You take and retake like a pro and always see what you just shot! TIP: Get a battery recharger and three sets of &quot;aa&quot; batteries. You'll run out of charge faster than you can shoot your pics. I carry two sets with me on a shoot for 122 pics.

    Three:..Great software comes with the OLYMPUS.It's called &quot;Camedia.&quot;
I use CompuPic Pro when working my pics but Camedia is so good in some aspects, that I use it a lot! 

    Four:...With digital photography you don't do a lot of &quot;tricks.&quot; It's done in your computer. So don't pay more than five hundred bucks, for great pics. The 3x lense is great and you can do acceptable close-ups too! Spend your money on good Photo software.

    Five:...I use the direct cable hook-up for down-loading my pics, but a 3 1/2&quot; adapter comes with tha camera for entering your pics through your 3 1/2&quot; drive.<br><br>
