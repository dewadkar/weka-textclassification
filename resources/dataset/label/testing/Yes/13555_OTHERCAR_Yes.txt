            The original Volkswagen Golf GTi is a venerable classic amongst compact cars, the original 'hot hatch'.  Its appearance on US shores arguably changed American automobiling, proving that a small, economical car can still be fun.  It's virtues of light weight, powerful engine (for the time), and great handling earned it praise from every angle.

But, nearly ten years and two restylings later, enthusiasts wondered where the GTi was going.  In 1993, the Golf/Jetta platform was revamped, which brought some positives, but also made it heaver with an anemic 2-liter, 4-cylinder engine as the only choice available.  Hardly enough power to haul around the new bulk.  While handling and road feel were still excellent, those who really wanted a fast compact car went elsewhere.

1995 would prove to be a landmark year for the GTi, however, as a new, more powerful powerplant become avilable for the first time in this platform.  The 2.8-liter VR6 six-cylinder  engine gave the GTi the performance boost it needed, and catapulted it back into the hearts of enthusiasts and the good graces of critics everywhere.

The GTi is essentially the top-level Golf available in the US.  Keeping with it's sporty character, the hatchback is only available in a two-door model, with a choice of either the four or six-cylinder engine.  The 2.0 four is good for 115 horsepower and 130 lb/ft of torque.  While the low power won't make it a drag strip winner, the healthy amounts of torque for such a small engine make it easy to drive in the city or on the highway, facilitating easy passing and providing plenty of power down low.

The VR6 is the real beauty here, and the reason to get the GTi (The VR6 is not avilable in other Golf trim levels of this year).  Pushing out a respectable 174 horsepower and 178 lb/ft or torque, this motor is enough to satisfy the speed cravings of almost any driver.

A 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual transmission are both available, however Volkswagen's automatic transmissions of this time were not the most reliable.  If shopping for a used GTi with an auto, make sure the transmission is performing flawlessly.  I personally reccomend the more exicting 5-speed stick, a nearly bulletproof transmission.

The GTi comes standard with power windows, alloy wheels, 4-wheel disc brakes, and air conditioning.  A power sunroof is a popular option, and AM/FM cassette is the norm, with rare models having a factory CD player.  The six-speaker stereo system is adequate for most drivers, however audiophiles will probably want to upgrade slightly.

Along with the VR6 engine, 1995 was the first year that dual front airbags were standard on the Golf and Jetta.  Couple this with daytime running lights and front crumple zones, and the GTi is a very safe vehicle, especially for it's age.  Anti-lock brakes were an option this year, but are very rare.

Outside, the car has classical great looks.  With a 'pug-dog' stance and elegant hatchback design, it looks modern today.  A boxy frame accented with graceful curves around the headlights, roofline, and rear hatch complete the look.  Inside, four adults can fit comfortably, and a fifth can be squeezed in, but not for long trips.  The rear hatch holds plenty of cargo, and the rear seats fold flat, allowing almost anything to be stored.  front seats are manually operated, and many complain of the 'crank' mechanism to recline the front seats.  It's something you either hate or don't mind.  The front seats slide foward or back, and the steering wheel tilts to provide a comfortable position for the driver.  I'm 6'0" and I have plenty of head and legroom, though taller drivers may find the sunroof gets in the way.

Controls are laid out very well, and are easy to find.  The HVAC knobs are very large and easily within reach, allowing the driver to adjust them without taking their eyes off the road.  None of the controls are close enough to the shifter to be in the way, and the dash gauges are large and easy to read.

The GTi outfitted with either engine is a joy to drive, eaisly tossed into turns without complaint.  This is due in part to a slightly stiffer suspension setup than the other Golf trim levels, along with wide tires and a low stance.  Drivers of the manual transmisison linked to the 4-cylinder engine can expect to easily get 30mpg or more in mixed driving, and those with the VR6 should be able to reach 24mpg with no problems.

Prices range from $4500 (for a high-mileage 4-cylinder) to $8000 (for an excellent condition VR6 with all options).  While this is somewhat high for and older vehcile, the GTi is very well built and extremely reliable.  The only catch here is that parts and repairs can be expensive if something does fail, a problem that most VW's suffer.  Knowing how to do simple maintenance, such as oil changes, goes a long way toward making the GTi a very cost-efficient vehicle.

If looking for a used '95 GTi, one should carefully inspect the wheel wells and around the bumpers for rust.  Also, make sure all of the body parts are aligned properly; miasalignment probably means it was involved in an accident.  The timing belt should be changed every 70,000 miles, so inquire about that, though clutches on the manual transmissions can go for 150,000 miles or more.  Manual transmissions that have been abused often have a failing reverse gear; an easy test is to drive in reverse up to about 10-15 mph.  A failing gear will actually pop out of reverse into neutral; steer clear of this.  Other than those issues, these cars are quite solid, and even squeaks and rattles are rare.

The original factory bumper-to-bumper warranty was 10 years/100,000 miles.  Used, the warranty drops to 50,000 miles, and virtually no used cars will have the manufacturer's warranty left.  If you're lucky enough to find a '95 model as a used certified VW, you will get a short used vehcile bumper-to-bumper warranty, but most dealers don't have cars older than 3-4 years.

Overall, 1995 is probably the second most important year for the GTi in its history, next to the first year of introduction.  Stepping into a VR6 model and wringing it out will please even the most finicky driver, and not only is this car fun, but economical and easy to own.  If you live in the country, you'll enjoy driving the winding back roads, and city dwellers will like it's small size, tight turning radius, and overall good looks.  Anyone looking for a small car in the $5000-$8000 range would do themselves well to check this car out.
