            I bought a 2000 Dodge Ram 4 wheel drive Quad-Cab and I love this truck.  The 5.7 liter V-8 engine is powerful and runs perfect.  I used to have a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 and there have been many interior improvements in the last two years; better cup holders and better locations for the Overdrive button and driving lights.  The seats, dash controls and layout is great.  This vehicle is as roomy and comfortable as many mid-size and even some full size cars.  The exterior is outstanding, fine workmanship.

A drawback would be the stock stereo, which is not great if care much for music.  The upgrade stereo with Infinity brand speakers is nice, but for the same money you can have a good aftermarket CD player installed.  The Dodge also sits up high, and the stock tires look kind of small on a truck of such stature.

After owning two of these trucks, and taking note of what my friends with Dodge and other trucks have passed on to me, I would highly recommend the full size Dodge trucks, and make sure you to stay away from the TOYota.

-----------------------

Update!  10/2000  -  Nearly 10,000 miles and not a problem.  The engine is breaking in great, better mileage and more power.  I may never buy another truck, it feels like this one will last me forever.
