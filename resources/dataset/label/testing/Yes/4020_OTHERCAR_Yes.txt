            I am about 6ft. 3inches.  200+ lbs. and have a shoe size of 16.  Basically when I go shoe shopping I look for what fits, then consider the price, so naturally I went car shopping as if I was looking for a comfortable pair of shoes.  I went to one of the Bay Areas hotspots for car shopping, Steven's Creek Boulevard.  I sat in all sorts of vehicles such as the Oldsmobile Intrigue, Buick Regal, Honda accord, Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Mistubishi Eclipse, BMW 5series, etc.  I noticed a very prevalent trend, they were too small for me.  I have long legs and the driver's and passengers's side volume really doesn't accommodate a pants length of 34L+.  I then began to look at SUV's and trucks.  I sat in the Toyota 4Runner Limited, Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, Chevy Blazer, GMC Jimmy, Dodge Dakota, and the Mistubishi Montero Sport.  They all gave more room than all of the automobiles I was test driving.  Then I noticed that the Dodge Durango was a little roomier than the rest of the pack.  I was starting to grin!  So then I asked the Dealer to allow me to sit in one of their Ram Pick-up Trucks, and immediately found a truck that was roomy enough for me.  The only problem is that I am not a truck man, rather an SUV man.  So I left the Dodge dealership and went further down the road.  I went to a Chevrolet dealership and started on their used car lot sitting in more vehicles.  I exited my car and immediately was approached by a nice salesman, and he asked me what I was looking for.  I said anything that will fit me.  He showed me this wonderful 2000 Chevy Tahoe Z71 4WD totally hooked-up.  I took it for a spin, and I have to say, I found the perfect car/SUV for me.

    Immediately I was overwhelmed with its two tone leather trim, and interior spaciousness.  I loved the 8 way power and Heated Driver and Passenger seats.  Before I took it for a test drive, I sat in the back to see how my dad or other family would fit, and it was comfortable.  VERY COMFORTABLE!!!!!!!   I especially appreciated the passenger side speakers and also the Heating/AC controls with overhead reading lamps and a wonderful storage section in between the back two seats for cups and cds.  My fiance really likes the sports side step that allows her to get into the vehicle easy.  The height of the Tahoe off the ground is perfect form my long legs.  Entering the vehicle is actually a comfort for me since it is a little high off of the ground. 

    The Tahoe rides great on its sports tuned suspension.  The engine is big and very powerful, 5.9L  270hp, and with a life expectancy of 250,000 miles!  (100,000 miles before its first scheduled tune-up!!!!!)  The sound system is great.  The seat fits me perfectly supporting my neck and back with absolute ease.  Driving is makes you feel like you are King of the World!  It accelerates briskly, and a very nice feature is that the sound system automatically adjusts to compensate for wind-noise as you accelerate!  There is little wind noise, but its little features like SCV, the sound control volume setting that compensates for wind-noise, that makes you feel like a million bucks!  

  As I continue to drive the vehicle, I will update this review to reflect how it breaks in, how it continues to drive, comfortability, if there are little tid bits that start to appear, etc.....
