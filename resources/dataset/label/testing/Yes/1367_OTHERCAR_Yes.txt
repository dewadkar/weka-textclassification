            Leased it back in Nov. 99, came with power and sports package, power seat controls only on the drivers side though. High performance Goodyear tires that I haven't seen or been able to buy anywhere. Nice alloy wheels. Also had leather interior with a nice wood grain finish. Dual air-bags, ABS, passive ignition and of course the 2.5 V6 DOHC engine. As well as all of the benefits that a Ford Red Carpet Lease provides. This is my second Ford lease; the first was a 95 Mercury Tracer.
     The one thing I would like to say to people is that you have to take care of your car if you expect your car to take car of you. You can't just put gas in it and think it's supposed to last forever! My car gets it's oil changed every 4k, and has had all of the preventative maintenance that the manual asks for. This is why I haven't had a single problem with it yet. There was a recall on it for replacing something that had to do with the brakes but it only took them about an hour to fix it.
     I would have liked to seen some things in the interior a little different however. The placement of the cup holders could have been in a better place and the armrests could have been designed better. There is a nice wood grain finish on the dash that I like and the leather adds a nice look and comfort. The CD player supports CDRï¿½s, which I think is cool because most don't. 
     The handling while driving is very good. The V6 provides a decent acceleration for a 2.5-liter. This car loves to cruise a 3,000rpm, which is about 85mph while on the highway. There is a governor installed on the engine to prevent it from going past 110mph while there is still 2,000rpm left before it redlines. This is probably for my own good however ;) They could have done a better job on outside noise control however and they could have chosen better shock absorbers. You can at least do something about the shocks though.
     The body design is a sporty 4-door, mine has a rear spoiler. This car was built SOLID. I got into a 4-car pile up and was sandwiched between the 1st and 3rd car. The 4th car was totaled the 3rd and 1st car had extensive damage including a bent frame on the 3rd. My car however only had minor bumper damage! Everyone at the wreck was looking at my car in amazement, including myself. I think this may have something to do with the fact that I saw in coming and released the brakes right before impact, therefore transferring some of the shock to the car in front of me. I must say that I feel just as safe in this car as I do in a Volvo.
     Overall I have to say this has been my favorite car so far and I will probably keep it instead of turning it in for another lease.
