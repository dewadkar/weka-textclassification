            I'm on my Second 4 Runner, having the sold the first after 120,000 miles.  Well built, comfortable to drive, low maintenance (for a 4x4) have earned &quot;TRUCK&quot; a permanent place in my garage, and would buy another without question.  Current &quot;TRUCK&quot; I bought new in 94.

That said, there are some drawbacks that a potential buyer should consider.
1.  In colder climates (Minnesota/Iowa) the defrosting system is inadequate.  The rear window and front windscreen are fine, but I encountered iceing everywhere else)
2.  Gas mileage in town is not that great (~ 15 mpg)
3.  Towing capacity is limited to 3500 pounds on older models, though this has been increased on some of the newer models to 5000 pounds.
4.  It can be difficult for older folks with mobility problems to get in and out of.
