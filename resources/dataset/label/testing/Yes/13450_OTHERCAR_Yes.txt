            A year ago I decided to buy a sports car, and after a few months of research and looking, I decided on an F-body (which includes Chevy Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds).  I bought a white 1999 Z-28 Camaro and I've loved it ever since.  It is sleek, stylish and turns heads.  The engine purrs with aggressive power waiting to be unleashed and
it handles like a dream.  High-speed cornering and rapid acceleration are a breeze and the car is spacious and comfortable to drive.  

The difference between the 1999 and 2001?  Performance and horsepower.  Body style is identical, interior has few changes, the difference is in the engine.  There are a tremendous amount of aftermarket modifications that can be done to the car as well, from cosmetic changes to performance improvements, the Camaro is one of the most readily modified cars on the market.  So you can buy it fast and make it faster or just enjoy the factory speed, both are sure to provide hours of driving delight.

There are a few things to consider about the car, however.  Number one is insurance!  High performance sports cars are not friendly on the wallet, it will cost you more than your average vehicle to insure.  Secondly, you have to feed the beast.  Premium gasoline please.  It has a fourteen gallon tank and can go 240 to 300 miles on a tank, depending on how you drive it, city vs. interstate driving, etc.  Third, this is not a family car.  It has a back seat, but few of us can really fit comfortably back there!  Also, there isn't much trunk space.  It has a deep "well" of a trunk that will hold quite a bit, but don't plan on hauling too much.  Fourth, the catalytic converter rests below the foot area on the passenger side.  This results in a "hump" on that side which is distinctly uncomfortable to sit in for a long time.  And lastly, there is a lot of "body" on this car, it takes a while to wash it!  Of course I mean by hand, not one of those automatic car washes!

All in all, this is a great car.  I've had very little maintenance issues, I had to replace the rear wheel speed sensor, but it was covered by warranty.  I recommend this car for those who appreciate fine sports cars with an affordable price.  I certainly do not recommend it for a young or inexperienced driver.  The speedometer registers 150, but it will certainly do more than that quite easily.  The car handles so well, you'll look down and see that you are going 70 and it feels like high 40s.  Too much power for a novice.  Yeah, it's cool but it's not worth your life!  

This is your last chance for new Camaros and Firebirds, as the F-body has been discontinued.  Available in several models, the v6 (often RS configuration), the v8 (Z-28), and the ultra-sleek, uber-fast v8 SS.
