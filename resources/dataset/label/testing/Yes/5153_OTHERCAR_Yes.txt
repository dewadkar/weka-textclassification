            I owned a Dodge Dakota Sport in 1998 and now in the year 2000.  But why chose a Dakota?  Often compared to the Sonoma and Ranger ( GMC and Ford ) the Dakota rides smoother than either of it's two competeters.  It comes with a standard V-6 magnum but can also be obtained in a I-4 or V-8.  Dodge trucks are know to have a unique and different design that is not imitated anywhere.  The Dodge Dakota Sport is fast, sturdy, and an overall better looking truck than it's competiters. Don't get me wrong, it is not a truck for wimps.  I've been in accidents in this truck and while the opposing vehicle was next to totaled, there wasn't more than a dent in my Dakota.  I've also hauled many things in this truck and it has proved itself worthy to be one of the best overall trucks in the world.  In my opinion you wont find a better truck anywhere.<br><br>
