            I bought a 1999 Stratus in December of last year. I have really enjoyed the car. It is a nice family car and it rides very well. 

We have not had any trouble of any kind with this car. It has safety locks on windows and doors. Plenty of room in car and trunk. The thing I like most about my car is the size. The car is not too big on the outside but has plenty of room on the inside. The car that I have is a four door and it is still a little sporty. 

I have a four year old daughter and she has plenty of room in the back seat. In a few months I will have another child and I have already put the infant seat in to see how much room we will have with two car seats and there is actually enough room in between them for some one else to ride. 

I would say 5 people could definitely ride in this car very comfortably. If you are looking for a nice family car I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
