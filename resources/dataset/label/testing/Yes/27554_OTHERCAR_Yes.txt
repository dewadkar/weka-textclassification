            I bought this vehicle while out looking for a nice family SUV.  I believe I made the best choice I could have made.  This SUV is roomy, will seat five, with plenty of cargo space.  I got the 'upgraded' model, everything is power...  windows, steering, brakes, etc.  My only regret is it is only a cassette player, not a cd player.  It gets great gas mileage, especially for city driving.  I get approx. 25-30 miles a gallon.  Not bad for a big SUV.  These vehicles offer a nice ride, and quiet.  I have come to the conclusion that until I go with a small car again, Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo's will be my car of choice.<br><br>
