            The title itself is an oddity, but its true. If you've never driven a car of this magnitude, then you will straight s**t your pants.

It gets you there when you absolutely have to be there, FAST. 

Set the cruise control on the highway and nothing short of a tornado or hurricane will stop you from reaching your destination. Stand on the brakes and you'll be holding your eyes in the sockets. Turn on the A/C and you'll freeze your balls off (if you feel so inclined to do so). The climate control system in this car is SSSSWWWWWEEEET. No stupid, dumb dials to turn or sticks sliding across the dash. Just convenient and in reach buttons to push with ease. Hit "Auto" and the car custom tailors an atmosphere inside the car that it feels best suits the drivers needs depending on the weather outside.

Ever sit in your car and listen to the radio REAL loud. Try sitting in this one and doin the same. The experience will simply explain itself to what I mean. 8-speakers and a full range equalizer. Nice job Dodge/Mitsubishi!! Mine came with a 6-disc CD changer in the rear hatch. Tape/CD/Radio whatever you want.....go ahead and blare it all you want. I suggest Parallel Universe by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

So you think your dad's old Nissan Z-car looked cool and aerodynamic? Try parking this baby next to it. All the sudden the Z looks like a Full size van stuck in Park. Whereas, the Stealth looks as if its doin' 150 mph, standing still. Definite chick magnet.

Go ahead, start it up. That's a marvel of automotive achievement under the hood. It'll purr when you want, but throw itself into a chaotic frenzy when summoned to do so. The 3-liter V-6 manufactured by Mitsubishi has been in production (in many vehicles too) for a little while now and the only variation people have been having complaints about is the SOHC V6 offered in the base model Stealth and Stealth ES. It, in my collective opinion of course, just plain sucks. Sure it was fine in Sundance Dusters, Daytonas and Dynastys but not for this elite machine. The DOHC and Twin-Turbo DOHC models were and are praised among many and personally I won't buy a Stealth/3000GT unless its Twin-Turbo. Might as well go all out, and beat everyone up in the lane(s) next to you.

Rev it up real high (cuz this car needs it for a proper launch) and the sudden realization of getting smashed in the back end with something very large traveling at a very high speed is what it feels rocketing down the road from a standstill in this car. You'll maybe get a "chirp" from these 245/45-17s gripping all four corners thanks to the AWD system on this car.

All wheel drive makes you feel invincible, contrary to what was posted on another review.....I've never had problems with the hydroplaning/bad weather driving at all. The tires on this car were Bridgestone Potenzas before and now Kumho ECSTA Supra 712s. Sumitomo HTR+ in the winter. Never have I really had problems at all water wise. Of course if inappropriate driving is going on then, yes, I suppose the car slides around. Winter is a definite story of its own but anyone in there right mind doesn't drive aggressive with 307-320 horsepower on wintery roads anyway. Overall, the car is well mannered, if the driver is in turn. Just my opinion.

Sure, the car has its demons. High cost of everything. Insurance. General maintenance. Major maintenance. Namely, the 2nd and 4th gear synchros in the Twin-Turbo's Getrag AWD transmission. I heard that the replacement costs of such a tranny are upwards of around $4500-5000 dollars American.

Another thing, the car gets a bad rap for not being a "true" sports car. More like a Grand Tourer. Know why? The weight of this thing. This car in top optional form weighs nearly 2 tons. That combined with a sluggish steering systems somewhat adopted from the 90's Daytonas and Spirits, this car may seem unresponsive to turn-in and its general tendency is to understeer or to plow its front end into a corner.
