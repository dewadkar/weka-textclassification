            I purchased my RAV4 several months ago and I just love it!! It looks very sharp and the mileage is good for a SUV.  The CD player and stereo system sounds great and I find the seats to be very comfortable.  It can easily seat 4 average size adults very well.  I'm very petite so leg room is not really an issue.  Unfortunately, I got rear ended on the freeway a few weeks ago.  On a positive note, I was not harmed (I was wearing a seat belt) but it resulted in $1800 worth of damage.  The spare tire in the rear, I believe, served as a very good "shock absorber" and as a result there was minimal damage to the car considering the impact.  Also, I was not hurt at all...thank goodness.

Other than that, I really love my new RAV4.  The rainforest pearl (green) is gorgeous and I think overall, the car just looks really sharp.  It does not have the power of an SUV though.  I live in the city so I do not plan to ever drive "off road" so power and that type of handling is not an important feature to me.  Of course it does not ride as smooth as my mom's Benz, but for the overall price of a car, I do highly recommend this car.  I hope you enjoy this car as much as I do.  =)
