            I bought my '96 Stratus after having owned a '91 Plymouth Acclaim and an '88 Plymouth Sundance. The Stratus was my first really new car. I had to factory order it because I wanted a 5 speed manual transmission and they are hard to come by.

The first day I came home with my Stratus, I got a &quot;check engine&quot; light. I took it back to the dealership the next day and it had a failed sensor. At a whopping 36 miles, I was tempted to get rid of it right then and there. But the dealership did the job quickly, squeezing me in and doing the repair in less than 30 minutes.

I had chosen to buy the extended warranty and I'm glad I did. In the 4 years I've had the car, the rack and pinion steering, the front ball bearings and the head gasket went. All repairs were covered by my warranty and a $50 co pay for each repair. I was also given a rental vehicle at no charge when my car had to stay the night for a repair.I also had the extended warranty on the Acclaim and Sundance and used it extensively.

Personally, I love the looks of the car. The lines are clean and sure to be classic, which is evident in the fact that Chrysler now designs it's Intrepid to look more like the Stratus. My neighbors loved the car, stating that it looked sporty, but had a large enough back seat to fit two adults fairly comfortably.

The Stratus has a somewhat sporty suspension, something I was not prepared for, especially on long drives. It corners like a dream, hugging tightly and steadily all the way through those wonderful decreasing radius turns we have in our mountainous region. But this region also offers many hills, and I don't dare try to climb them with the air conditioner running. My 4 cylinder Stratus sports the same 132 horse power engine that it's &quot;little sister&quot; the 1996 Neon sports and that air conditioner saps the power quickly.

The Stratus also has very large windows, indicative of Chrysler's &quot;cab forward&quot; design. That means, park it in the shade or it will be like an oven on a sunny day. 

If you like the feel of a sporty car, but have limited funds, the Stratus may provide what you're looking for. But if you're over 5'10&quot; tall, you may find yourself hitting your head off the roof. The car tends to be fairly low in profile. My husband often has to dip down in the seat to get full view from the windshield.

Chrysler has a winner with it's cab forward design and I believe the Stratus will be around for a while. With the gas mileage I get (it averages about 31 mpg on the highway)I'm glad I made the choice to purchase this car. 

It's nice to be able to buy American and be satisfied!

Update- 9/2003- I was involved in a minor accident with my beloved Stratus recently. I was rear-ended by an F-150 pick up truck while I sat at a traffic light. The impact took out the driver's side rear tail light assembly and gave the bummer a mighty crack. But there was no sheet metal damage at all. The bumper did a great job and the impact material (looks like plain old styrofoam to me) spread that impact out. All in all, $1K in damage. The car still values at about $3800, so it wasn't totaled by the insurance company. Overall, I'm satisfied with out it performed in the accident.
