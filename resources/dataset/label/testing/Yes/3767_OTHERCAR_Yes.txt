             My husband finally talked me into trading our 1992 ext cab Silverado in on a new truck with shiney paint and a payment book. This has been one of the best decisions we ever made. The third door option allows us to let the kids in and out without being inconveinced. The power this truck has is wonderful! It compares to a mustang we had about 8 years ago. I can only rave that I feel safe, confident and secure. Our Saint Bernard even enjoys the ride in back attached to the conveinent built in bed loops. The only feature I would have added is a remote ignition, so that our truck will be warm and toasty for those early morning trips to school. Chevys road-side assistance program gives me added security. I feel like a queen just going down the road- THANK YOU CHEVROLET!! <br><br>
