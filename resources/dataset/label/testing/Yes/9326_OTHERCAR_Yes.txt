            My Silhouette is a 1990.  We bought it in 1995 when our third child was born.  It had over 85,000 miles on it when we purchased it, and now has approximately 125,000.  

We have taken several long car trips in the van. We now have 4 children and the space between the individual back seats allows them a little more space. 

Our van has separate lap belts and lap/shoulder belt combos.  The lap belts are safest for the use of car seats.  I really do not see much difference in driving the van and driving a station wagon except that the van sits a little higher.  

In the almost 5 years we've owned it, we have only needed to replace the driver's seat (the power seat controls burnt out) and the driver's seat belt.  Also, the driver's door handle and the handle for the sliding door.  The biggest plus for me is the individual seats that fold down into tables.  We get good gas mileage with the van.  

I am 5'6&quot; and can walk around inside the van bent at the waist.  Having ridden in other car company models for the early and late 90s, I have not found one with as much open area in the back as my van.<br><br>
