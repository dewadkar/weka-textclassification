            For months I wanted a digital camera. I was really tired of buying and developing film, then scanning in my photos. I bought this JVC by chance at a local Best Buy. It has turned out to be a gem! I chose the JVC because of its name, I trust the brand. Rightly so. It's been 2 years now and I have haven't had any unexpected techinal problems. 

I LOVE the zoom! For max zoom, you must use it on it's Manual mode, but I swear I can shoot a flea off a dog 200 feet away! ;)

The video feature is neat, too. You depress the "shutter release" and just walk around takin' video. Then press again to stop filming. Wish it had sound. Video quality is not spectacular, but Gramma will still get a kick out of seeing little Billy's home run on email!

Don't use the display screen for taking pictures. Yes it IS neat, but it's not worth the battery.  Manual mode requires the display screen. So does the delete and playback features where you review your photos. Don't go crazy with the screen and it'll be fine. Extra batteries are available for around $50 and highly recommended. 

Flash features include a forced flash, which is great for portraits outdoors, and a red-eye reduction which does not help with animals. If you use the flash with your animal, you will have funky eyes every time with this camera. 

I love the timer which has two time settings 10 seconds and I think 5 seconds. I can't run very far in 5, but the 10 works really well! I like being in my own pictures. 

It looks a little intimidating, but just remember all the cool features that are represented by all those little buttons! I run and show my hubby everytime I discover something new! This is still happening.

In edit mode you can change your photos to sepia, black & white, and negative then save them in addition to the original picture or over the original. It's pretty cool. 

You can adjust the photo quality to one of three different settings. You have to consider what you are photographing at the time to adjust the settings, but it does not take long. 

Get a case for it... I put it in a bag with my manual Cannon AE-1 and apparently they got in a fight and the Cannon won. JVC's all scratched up, but to its defense, it took a beating and still works fine. 

I really uploading and sending my photos to Mom in Texas! We have a new puppy so we take pics, upload, email, and clean up puppy poop in about 5-10 minutes. :0)
