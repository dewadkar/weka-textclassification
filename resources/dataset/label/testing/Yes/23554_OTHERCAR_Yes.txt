            I bought my NX new back in 1993.  Since this was my first car, I did a little research.  I looked at the Geo Storm(seemed everyone had one at the time), the Mazda MX-3, Saturn SC (both too small inside) and the Nissan.  I think I made the right choice.  It's been a great car.  

I love the blue car and in the seven years of owning one, I have only seen 2 with the same color.  The car has about everything you could want:  power windows, door locks, cruise, air conditioning (more on that later), and of course the tee-tops.  Mine also has a 5 speed which I love.  The engine is very rev happy with a redline at 7500 RPM.  The ride is stiff, but you should expect that for a little sports car.  It eats sharp turns for breakfast.  Because of the stiff ride, however, I don't recommend cross-country trips.  The tee-tops is one of the best features of this car.  It's a blast to take off the tops and go for a drive during a fall afternoon.  The tops are kind of bonus even when they're on because they give a little more headroom.  Mechanically, I haven't had a major problem in the seven years of ownership (knock on wood).  I've been in a couple of fender benders and car has held up very well.  In fact I got rear ended hard enough for the other car's air bags to deploy and all it did was scratch up the rear bumper.

Now about that air conditioner.  It's been weak from the get go.  Having a black interior makes the car an oven on a summer day and the air conditioner can't handle it at all.  But I guess that's why you've got tee-tops.  

Overall, if you can't tell, I love this car.  It will be hard to part ways with it.  <br><br>
