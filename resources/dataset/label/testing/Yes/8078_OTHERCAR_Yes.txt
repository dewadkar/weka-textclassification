            Well, actually, our 1997 GMC Safari is rather nice looking, so I have to be fair. It's a beautiful green with some splash graphics that match our 2002 Coleman camper. But it's got that rolling box look and I doubt that will ever change, because GM has been making the van pretty much the same since the 80's.

Looks aside, we've been pleased, overall, with our GM vans. Husband drives one for work everyday, so when it came time to replace our Dodge Dakota in 2001, he decided to get a Chevy Astro (also a 1997). We had it for a few months when some idiot decided to use it to stop his pickup truck when, surprise, surprise, it wouldn't stop on ice with bald tires. Airbags deployed and husband walked away unhurt, but the van was totaled. It performed extremely well in the head on collision and for that we are grateful.

I found a 1997 GMC Safari at a dealer 75 miles away via the Internet. We went and looked it over, took it for a long ride and signed the papers. 

Our Safari has the SLX decor package and, truthfully, I don't know what that really includes. We swapped the regular front buckets out and replaced them with the seats from our totaled Astro (the two vans are identical in interior color), because they had arm rests and the ones in the Safari didn't. We also took the luggage rack off the Astro and put it on the Safari (it was an interesting project, but it's been rock solid with no leaks, thus far).

Husband is impressed with the Vortec V6 in these vans. They pull our 3600 lb. camper well. We did add a tranny cooler and brake controller (required in New York state). He could tow the camper with one hand on the steering wheel and a coffee in the other hand. However, this spring was a different story. Something was severely wrong with the steering.

After much searching on the Internet, I found a very helpful site that is Safari/Astro van exclusively. This is where I learned that these vans are notorious for bad steering components. The steering ended up being very sloppy, with the wheel not returning to center after making a turn. It required constant small adjustment moves when driving and when towing, this was compounded. 

The first thing we did was have it aligned and the tires rotated and balanced. No go- it still drove terribly. Next, from info on the Safari/Astro forum, we changed the idler arms and replaced them with after-market Moog brand. Better but not great steering was the result. Next, the steering box was replaced (under an after market warranty). Still, the steering was no better.

On the eve of a long trip, we got under the van and looked for anything that might be wrong (this, after it spent two days at the dealership and all they could do was shrug and say they had no clue). Husband found inner tie rod ends were notchy in movement- usually they will get loose, but the protective boots were ripped, so all we can figure is salt got in there from the winter). $36 and an hour later, new tie rods ends were in place. 

We took off on a trip the next morning and husband was very happy- driving along and drinking his coffee instead of white knuckling the steering wheel. It needs to be re-aligned now, but it seems the problem is solved.

The other problem is a "service engine soon" light that comes and goes. Again, the dealer looked at the codes, but there were many in the history and they cleaned those out, so they have no idea what is making the light go on. When it does come on, we find absolutely no difference in performance of the van.

The room in the interior is wonderful for our two children, 13 and 10 years old, and our chocolate lab. We have long since removed the third seat because it is heavy and it takes up cargo space. We use that space for the dog. The rear 12 volt outlet is wonderful, also. We plug in a Coleman Power Chill cooler back there and have cool foods for travel. We also like the two front 12 volt outlets on the passenger side- one holds my cell phone charger and the other holds our AC/DC television cord. The cigarette lighter has been removed and husband uses that outlet for his cell phone cord.

The middle van seating in our vehicle is a bench and a heavy one, at that. I would have liked to have captain's chairs there, but we bought the van in a hurry and didn't have time to look for one with the separate seats. The kids have good leg room and the seat has a high back and head rests for comfort. The front passenger wheel well leaves much to be desired for foot room. It's almost non-existent and very cramped. 

Our van has double back doors- another feature we would have liked to have changed- the Dutch doors are very nice and would have been preferred. The tow package on our van includes a 7 pin connector that is interior mounted (from the factory?). We are looking to move that outside, although it is protected in the winter inside, so that's a toss up. It's a pain to have the cord between the doors when we are towing. The cord needs to be re-taped quite a bit.

Our rear gear is a 3.23 to 1, which is one of the lower ones and gives us a maximum towing capacity of 4500 lbs. We have not had a problem with it, thus far, but we would have to get a new tow vehicle if we wanted a larger camper in the future. The van is also susceptible to cross winds and it will tend to wander quite a bit in a stiff breeze, more than likely due to it's high profile.

Overall, with over 90,000 miles on it, the A/C works great, the engine runs smoothly, it doesn't burn oil, the gas mileage is so-so, but we tow often (it gets about 12 mpg when towing, 16-17 when we aren't). Now that the steering is better, the van is much more pleasant to ride in and to drive. It's got the interior room we need for traveling and pulls the camper with relative ease. For a 6 year old van, we're pretty pleased with it.
