            I bought this 93 Jeep Grand Cherokee second hand at 140,000 miles.  It rides like a dream, and seems to handle as well as my neighbors caddilac.

Unfortunately all 93 JGC have some inherriant problems across the line and they are now showing their ugly heads.

1. Fuel pumps are notoriously bad between 100k and 140k, sure enough I bought my Jeep in the AM on a Monday and by nightfall it had left me stranded 3 miles from home.  Wouldnt start at the market.  Had to have it towed home, then towed to a shop who diagnosed and replaced the fuelpump: $350.00

2. Viscous Coupling.  These nasty items are notorious also of failing between 100k and 140k, and mine went out at 141k, it's still not been replaced since the vehicle can be driven like this for a while after you notice that it's a problem.  The part alone is $800.00 from a dealership, plus some labor to install it.

3. Rear windshield wiper is also a problem, in that they get intermittant when you start racking up some mileage.

4. Plenum Plate gasket is also a known problem on these vehicles.  When it goes out, your Jeep will start to consume oil, and will detonate (ping) upon moderate accelleration.  It's no cheap thing to replace either, my local dealer quoted me $600.00 or somewhere around there they say to replace it.

So, my Jeep has been affilcted with the more notorious problems of this year (and into later years), but overall I still love it.

It's smooth when driving and fun to drive long distances, but in short city hops, it can feel a bit like a boat at times, and parking isnt much fun.  It's an AWD (All wheel drive, all the time), which helps for those people that live in areas that are prone to much snow, ice or rain.  But it also means checking the tire pressure frequently to make sure they are all the same pressure, else you could destroy your transfer case over time.

It's got the creature comforts that I enjoy in a vehicle, like leather seats, cupholders, plenty of headroom, and a sunroof, plenty of cargo space, and while the back seats are a bit cramped for adults as far as leg room goes, it's not all that bad.

Even the stock stereo was nice, though as a lot of people have found out, the stock stereo cd player eventually dies and you might get intermittant AM/FM.  My AM/FM worked initially, but then became intermittant until I got tired of it and put in an aftermarket head unit which does a great job with the stock speakers, sounds crisp and clean, even at moderatly loud volumn levels.

Mileage is not one of it's best points, and I've consistantly gotten 15.2 mpg since I bought it, since I now live only 25 miles from work, it doesnt seem all that bad, and this is a combination of highway and city driving and for a 5.2L motor it's really not bad at all.  Even when I make 140 mile highway trips to the desert, it averages between 15.2 and 16.5 mpg depending on how Im driving it.

Again, it's a nice suv, comfortable, had plenty of creature comforts, gets average mileage, but can be a lot of fun to drive, both on and off the road.
