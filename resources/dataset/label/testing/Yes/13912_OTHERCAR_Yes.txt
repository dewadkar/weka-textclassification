            After bad experiences with with a Hyundai Tiburon, and an Elantra before that, we decided to shop around and do a little research before buying a new car.  My husband wanted a compact car for ease in driving and parking.  I wanted a midsized car for comfort during longer trips.  We settled on a Saturn.  
I can't tell you all the technical jargon about liters and horsepower.  What I can tell you is that buying and owning a Saturn is a pleasant experience.  On our first trip to the dealership, we test drove both the S Series and the larger L series.  There only seemed to be a minor difference in handling and ride, so we chose the smaller, less expensive Saturn S.  We gave the salesperson a list of options we wanted and let him pick our car.  We opted for an automatic transmission,  sun roof, CD player, power locks and windows.  The first thing that impressed me about our car is that it has dent resistant doors.  We live in an ocean resort town and parking is at a premium.  Most parking spaces are small and cramped and filled with SUV's with big doors.  I finally accepted the inevitable dings and chips on my car doors.  Well no more!  When the Saturn's door is hit, it actually 'gives in' and bends with the hit, then pops back into shape.  We've had our Saturn for 6 months now and there's not a scratch on it.  Everything works as it should.  Usually by now we would have had a new car in for 'warantee work' a few times. But not our Saturn.  Our Saturn has taken us on a 3000 mile trip to Minnesota in the cold of winter and handled as well on snow covered roads as it handles on our sandy streets.   
If you're looking for flash or excitement this is not the car for you.  But if you're looking for a good, solid, dependable, easy to own car- consider test driving a Saturn.
