            I drove a Plymouth Sundance for nearly 10 years and when I finally decided I needed to bid it farewell, I started researching Saturn.  One of my friends had bought one and had no complaints about the company so I simply followed her lead.  Since I purchased my little blue 1994 Saturn over two years ago, it has been nothing but good to me.  I commute to and from school approximately 300 miles per week which may not seem like a lot to some of you but considering the terrain and weather in parts of Wisconsin, my little car has not had an easy lifetime so far.  It's got well over 100,000 miles on and still looks and sounds as good as the day I drove it off the lot.  <br>The salesmen on that very special day and on occasions since when I take it in for its checkups have a great deal to do with my satisfaction also.  Although I see these people only every three months, they have committed themselves to knowing my name and my car.  It's not such a pain writing them a check knowing that when you get your car back it will have not only been looked over, but also washed and vacuumed out besides.  I know that the next time I begin thinking about purchasing a new car, there will not be any research to do.  The team at Saturn and this car that I've become quite attached to have my business for years to come.  Saturn is definitely a Different Kind of Company, Different Kind of Car!  <br><br><br>
