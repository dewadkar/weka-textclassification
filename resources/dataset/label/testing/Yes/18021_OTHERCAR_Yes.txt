            Like others here, I have owned this camera since the fall of last year (99). It has been one of the best investments I have ever made. Part of my business is web design, and the 620l has the versatility and features to help you get some great photos, amateur or not. One photo I won an award with- I was even challenged that it wasnt a digital photo. There are some &quot;features&quot; that will drive you crazy that have been fixed in later models, like total control over the camera. On some settings- it doenst matter how much you think it should be taking a shot- it refuses to do so. Kind of irritating if you dont have time to really setup a shot, like in action settings. The only other issue I have dealt with is to make sure you get a flash path adapter, either USB port or a floppy adapter, this allows you to put the memory card in an &quot;adapter&quot; and load it into your laptop or home computer. Downloading from your camera takes way too long and just drains more precious battery life. If you are lookign for telephoto lenses, and filters- they are fairly available to come by, I have a wide angle/telephoto/and three filters that came in a kit for 199.00, which I understand is a deal.

Happy shooting.<br><br>
