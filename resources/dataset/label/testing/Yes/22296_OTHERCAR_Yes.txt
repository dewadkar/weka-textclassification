            We picked up our 2000 MPV LX (w/ security package option) w/ 25k mi on it.  It's been everything we've heard it would be (my brother bought 2001 MPV ES new) and overall we are  happy with it.

Although some reviews have complained about the engine not being robust enough, for us coming off of a '90 MPV 4cyl, it feels peppery enough.  Besides, if 0-60 acceleration time is that important, station wagons may be a better option than a minivan.

My pet peeves are that I wish the transmission could've been better mated to the engine.  It has a tendency to shift in and out too readily, especially at midrange usable hwy speeds (40-60mph).  Also, the instrumentation stalks to the right of the steering wheel obstructs access to the radio & fan speed controls.  On top of that, the front and rear window wiper controls do take a while getting used to.

For us, aside from the relative affordability (as compared to Honda Odyssey), what really drove us to look at the 2000 MPV was it's size/dimension.  While some families desire the bigger size/dimension of the Odyssey & Grand Caravan, etc, we were forced to look for something that would fit in our garage.  @ 187" MPV just barely squeezes into our garage.  

Consequently, the rear sliding door entry clearance is smaller than the other bigger minivans but the usable space in the interior is remarkably good.  For a 'small' family (less than 4 children?) MPV should be up to the task.

We just did a recent road trip of ~500 mi and on the hwy we averaged 23 for mpg going with the flow of traffic.  City driving averages 19/20 mpg.
