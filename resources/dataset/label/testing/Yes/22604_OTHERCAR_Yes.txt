            The Toyota Corolla is a very basic car. It is very similar to the Nissan Sentra and the Honda Civic. I have always thought of the Civic as the sportier of the three, and the Sentra and Corolla as the more basic and conservative cars. I think that this 1993 Corolla has nice styling, but it isn't as attractive as the Honda. Overall, I think that the Corolla is a better car, but all three are really good cars.

The Corolla has an interior very similar to the Sentra, I own a Sentra, so it was interesting to see how similar these two cars are. I think that the differences between the two are personal choice and deals you can get from your dealer. The interior of the Corolla is very straight forward, and easy to understand and use. I would have preferred they had turn-dials for the climate controls. They are slider controls, and hidden under a ledge. The radio is easy to use, and above the climate controls. Both of these clusters are mounted a little high, and faced more towards the driver. It is still easy to use as a passenger, but also very easy to use as a driver. This center control cluster seems to be very similar to the Ford Contour and the Honda Civic. There is no center armrest, and the area between the front seats in very small.

The engine in this Corolla seems very potent. Not until last year did it come with variable valve timing (VVT-i). Still, the engine can accelerate quickly, and push you back in your seat. Yes, the engine is working, but you aren't pushing the car over the limit. The engine is only about 1.6 liters, like the Sentra, but it feels a little faster (at least in my experience). The handling is about the same with the two cars, and the ride is also about the same. I wouldn't say that the ride or handling on the Corolla is great, but it isn't terrible by any means. I would say it is a little better than expected, especially when you consider that the car is pretty small and cheap. 

The seats in the Corolla are also very comfortable. The rear seat has a moderate amount of room, nothing more than a Focus, but still enough to carry adults for a few hours. The head room is also substantial. The back of the Corolla isn't styled so sporty, and that creates more head room. The Sentra doesn't have much rear head room, and the Corolla is generous in this area. If you have some tall kids, consider this car. 

According to Consumer Reports, the Corolla has an excellent reliability record. It is a good choice for a used car, not just for its reliability, but for the durability. The Corolla I am referring to looked very good for seven years old. It just gives the impression of a well built car. It won't break down very easily, but little things won't break easy either. 

Overall I would say that from what I saw and experienced, the Corolla is a solid basic car. If you are looking at this for a good used car, I would recommend it, but I would also recommend looking for a Geo Prism, this is the exact same car, with a different badge. It usually is cheaper, but is by no means a worse car. The Corolla has good resale value, so if you ca save a few dollars, it is worth it. Looking at a Prism will help you save that money.<br><br>
