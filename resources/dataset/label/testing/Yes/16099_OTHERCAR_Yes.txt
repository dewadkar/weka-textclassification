<TEXT>
            To buy an SUV.  I've driven a Honda Civic for years and loved the &quot;zip-around&quot; capabilities it afforded me...but then came the Jeep!  I've been driving my Laredo for 3 months now and I will never go back to the Honda (much to my husband's dismay!) Here's what I like and dislike about my SUV

Why I bought it:  Driving to the slopes, hauling furniture, bringing dogs to the vet.

Love: the comfy interior, the color choices, the heating system, the room, under seat storage, easy to maneuver (a huge concern of mine)


Hate: the radio (poor sound quality), large blind spot, poor gas mileage, Difficult braking compared to the Honda Civic (duh!)

But the SUV rides smooth, the truck base sold me on the purchase and best of all...it's not a minivan!  I feel very safe in this vehicle.

I recommend it for everyone who does not have a long commute (gas guzzler).
