            A few years back, a got a job at my university part time for the dining hall services department. Part of my job was to drive around in a van transporting equipment from our main campus to the annex campus a few mile away. I got very well aquainted with the 1991 GMC Vandura 3500 high cube van. It had the 350 V8 and vinyl seats, it was a real site.

Powertrain: A

  There is decent power considering the heft of this vehicle. The 350 V8 has a pleasent sound to it. This engine has been around for a long time so its sure to be reliable, as has the transmission. Its a four speed automatic and it shifts well, and makes a lovely whine in first gear. How old school and charming! Fuel economy is lousy, probably around 10 MPG going downhill, but this was a full sized CUBE van so what could you honestly expect?

Steering/Handling: B+

   This is where this behemoth really surprised me. It handles well! I don't think I would enjoy it on a curvy back road, but the GMC feels safe. 
  The steering is quick and fairly precise. The brakes are very grabby when cold, even worse when wet and cold, but work well enough once they heat up.
  The ride quality isn't bad either. Unlike the Dodge Ram Van that I also drove on occasion, the big GMC rides pretty smoothly without all of the bouncing that the Dodge produces. The front wheels are a bit further out towards the front on the GMC while the Dodge has a very short front with the wheels almost directly under the driver and front passanger. This probably explains the difference.

Interior: C-

  Well, at least it has seats! And they're are not bad either. They offer no latteral support but are generally supportive for the lower back and legs. This is a no frills vehicle, menaing no A/C, no cruise control, no power anything and an AM radio. Reception is okay but the sound quality from the one speaker does leave much to be desired.
   Everything hear spells cheap. The quality of materials is quite poor, legroom is pretty skimpy due to some intrusion from the wheel wells, and there were lots of loose trim and wires! Not a good interior, but this generation of GMC/Chevy van dates back to the late '60s or early '70s, so I can cut it some slack.

Exterior: B
  I've always considered the GMC and Chevy vans amongst the better looking of the full sized. Why? Its just so honest and basic. Not one styling element is particularly attractive but the overall design flows well. Nothing odd, nothing garish, just a nice big box on wheels. Of course the cube body takes away from this somewhat versus the regular van body but not as much as you'd think. I prefer it to the Ford Econoline, Dodge Ram Van and even the new Chevy/GMC.

Overall: B-

  I have yet to drive the new GM vans, but I have driven the Ford Econoline and Dodge Ram Van. I like the old GM better than both of these newer models. In terms of steering and handling, these old bruisers hold their own with modern SUVs, not a small feat! Plus its powertrain options are tried and true and work suprisingly well. 
  It may not be a high quality vehicle, but its one that represents a good value and one that gets the job done right.
