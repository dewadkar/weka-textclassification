            We own a 1997 Chevy Venture. After looking for months and test driving lots of minivans I gave up. I wanted the dual sliding doors and all of the minivans I found with that option were not to my liking. When I stumbled across a Chevy Venture with the dual sliders while at Target I was thrilled to pieces. We went and test drove it and I fell in love. I drove it off the lot that night and have been very happy ever since. 

It has loads of space and approximately 17 cup holders. You always have a place for your drink. It is a very smooth riding van with comfortable seating. I have a 7 passenger with 3 buckets in the middle and 2 in the rear.  All of the seats in the rear are removable and are very easy to remove if you need space to bring something large home. It has rear air which is a must with children. Theater seating makes it easy for people in the rear to see up ahead without always looking at the back of someone's head. When my lease is up I will be upgrading to a new Chevy Venture. <br><br>
