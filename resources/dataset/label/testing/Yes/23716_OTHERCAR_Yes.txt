I have this car and i love it!  The Saturn company is wonderful always very polite and helpful. they honestly want you to be happy with your decision and purchase and are not just looking for the sale.  Once you buy the car they do not just forget about you but consider you part of the Saturn family.  They have new owners banquets, surveys they send out about to learn about your feelings towards your purchase.  The thing I like the most is their maintenance service.  They guarantee your vehicle and will fix it no hassles.  Older models and models not bought at that specific dealer are treated in the same manner as if you bought the car there or as if it was brand new.  The maintenance crew will look at your car free of charge and if their is something wrong tell you about it before they fix it so you are not stuck paying for something you didn't want fixed.  Even if you have nothing wrong with your car you also get a free car wash and vacuum out of it.
The car also has very good gas mileage to the gallon it is perfect for someone who travels long distances or cant afford to put twenty dollars a week into their car to fill it up.  They car also has a very long life span, it will last longer and with run better with a lot of mileage on it than any other i have driven.  I have a standard transmission and it has a lot of power for the engine it has. <br><br>
