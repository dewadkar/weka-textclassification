            We bought our Honda CRV in July 1997. 

Before making the decision, we had 2 SUV's in mind one was Honda CRV and the other was Toyota RAV4. When we went to the Toyota dealer, we liked the RAV4. We decided to test-drive it. We liked it. But we liked CRV's look better. So we went to the Honda dealer. When we took it for test drive, we realized that CRV has much more room inside. We liked it's interior too. The seats are very comfortable too. They can be adjusted so that one could practically sleep. It is not very huge like Ford Explorer and not too small like RAV4. It is just right. CRV was selling like hot cakes at the time. After deciding to buy, we had to wait for 4 weeks for our CRV to be shipped from Japan.  

We have been driving our CRV for more than three years now. We are enjoying it very much. I would definitely recommend anybody to buy Honda CRV.<br><br>
