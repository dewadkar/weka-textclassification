            I have owned the 2600 for a little over a year now and overall it has been a pretty decent camera. My usual disclaimer, manufacturers spend lots of money on their own websites where you can pick up the technical specs of cameras. I just want to give you my opinion on the camera not be redundant with information you can easily pick up elsewhere.

Overall the image quality will look good to the majority of people. I have printed out up to 8x10 size using Photo Glossy paper on an Epson Photo EX that looks very good, not as good as a 35mm 8x10, but still very good for a 2meg Digital. Unless you are real camera buff or picky picky picky you should be pleased with the image quality you will receive. Maybe it is just me, but the printed quality looks better than the digital image I see on my computer screens&#133strange. A Kodak DC-260 that I used to shoot with seemed to have better screen image quality when viewed on a monitor than the 2600.

The view screen on the back has adjustable brightness, but as with many such screens it is difficult to see in very bright sun conditions. It can also be difficult to tell if a picture is blurred unless you use the zoom feature to look closer at the picture. I personally find myself using the viewfinder more than the screen when taking the actual shots.

Ergonomically the 2600 is not bad. It is small, fairly lightweight and I like the sliding cover that helps protect the lenses mechanism. When I hold the camera ready to shoot my fingers falls naturally away from the lenses, flash or any other area that might interfere with normal camera operation. This can be important when you are having a person unfamiliar with the camera take a shot for you. Think about the times you have had to tell someone&#133&#148watch where your fingers are placed!&#148 as they were trying to take a picture of you. There are not an overwhelming number of buttons to deal with when taking or viewing pictures. The zoom is only a 3x, but it is a true 3x and not a silly Digital zoom.  One note about the zoom, it will not zoom in or out while the flash is recharging. 

Taking pictures themselves is pretty much point and shoot mode, which is good for those not familiar with the camera. The 2600 is not especially quick in taking a picture when a flash is needed, taking up to 5 seconds between shots depending on the distance of the previous shot. That&#146s right, I said the distance of the previous shot. Give this a try&#133take a flash picture of something across the room&#133now take a flash picture of your hand&#133notice that the flash will be ready much faster after taking the picture of your hand...strange. I am no expert, but I suspect it is using less flash power for the closer picture, thus the faster recharge time. One thing you need to watch is the fact that in auto flash mode the camera will take a picture whether the flash is ready or not. In forced flash mode the camera will not take a picture until the flash is ready. You really need to hold the camera steady for a split second longer to make sure the camera has taken a steady shot. I would say that approximately one picture out of thirty or so is unexpectedly blurred if you are not careful. I usually have anyone taking pictures for me take an extra shot just to be safe. The fact that you can take around 150 shots on a 128meg Smart Media chip at highest quality makes that possible. The 16meg chip only takes approx 20 shots so I personally would recommend purchasing a larger chip. I have seen come people use the lower resolution modes to get more pictures on a 16meg chip, but why the heck pay for a 2megapixel camera and use the 1megapixel mode all the time?

The rechargeable 1700mAh Ni-MH batteries will last for hundreds of shots per charge depending on the condition of the batteries, how the flash, view screen and zoom are used and whether you are using the power saver mode. Also, there is no battery power gauge other than the one that tells you when the battery is low. I would definitely recommend a second set of batteries since you need to wait until the Ni-MH batteries are discharged before recharging.

The video mode quality is low so you probably won&#146t use it unless it is the only option. I have used the video mode one time when I only had my 2600 because of space considerations and saw something that was too good to pass up. So it can come in handy.

The batteries and Smart Media chip share the same compartment, which is only slightly annoying when changing the memory chip on the move since the door itself only holds the batteries in.

The software used to connect the camera to the computer is pretty easy to operate and compares well with similar units. 

A word about the toughness of the camera. I used the camera for approximately a year in a harsh desert environment with only one problem near the end of that year. One single grain of sand made its way into the very inner lenses. This caused a small dark spot on pictures that were focused away, such as scenery shots. Considering what I put the camera through it was not too unexpected to have that happen. Other than that the camera has performed well.
