            If you've been contemplating the purchase of a digital camera, I am here to recommend that you check out the Sony Mavica FD-83. I bought my Mavica a month ago. It is so easy to learn to use, that I feel like I've been using it forever. 
I chose the FD-83 because I like several of the features it offers, starting with the fact that it uses floppy discs rather than a memory card. This makes it so easy to take pictures. Just pop the disc in any available computer, and voila!, you're viewing them right away. No computer available? Then just hook the camera up to a television set with the included cable, and you can watch them right on the TV. Don't like some of the pictures you took? Just delete them, and take some more! The FD-83 also has the capability to make a video (up to sixty seconds long), which can be sent to faraway friends and relatives via E-mail, and a voice stamp feature for still pictures, so you don't have to try and remember where each picture was taken.
This camera has great resolution, ranging from 1216x912 at the highest, to 640x480 at the lowest. I find the middle resolution (1024x768) takes beautiful, clear pictures.
The camera is a little pricey, with the average cost about $700, although with a little careful shopping, it can be had cheaper. I paid $487 total from an online merchant. The camera comes with a rechargeable battery, with a span of 120 minutes, and I would recommend purchasing a backup. For $59, you can buy one that should last about four hours before needing to be charged. If you decide to buy a camera bag, I would go with a bag made for a small camcorder, because the one that is made for the Mavica isn't roomy enough to hold the camera, the charger, and a lot of floppies.
