            I recently upgraded my SL1 Saturn to an LS.  The big difference being I went to a larger automatic model which was more sporty and stylish.  It's very similar to a Honda Accord, except for the heft price tag.

For what I could get from a base model Honda, I upgraded to a fully loaded Saturn.  Leather seats, CD player, automatic transmission, sunroof, heated front seats, the works. I loved my old Saturn but after having it for 2 years, I was ready for the next step.  I was also tired of the manual transmission which is a pain when driving short distances in city driving.  It was one of my better decisions!

The handling and feel of the car is improved on many levels.  I feel safer being in a larger car with a lot more leg room.  The car is heavier and feels very sturdy.  I was a little concerned that I would lose some &quot;pick up&quot; when I decided to go with an automatic but this hasn't been the case.  My new Saturn is very powerful and I don't miss the stick clutch at all.  The great gas mileage also is a major plus.  Trunk room is ample as is the back seat.  It would fit 5 comfortably on a long trip.

Upgrading my Saturn was a snap too as customer service is one of their strong points.  I knew exactly what I was getting for my money and wasn't pressured or rushed.  A great car buying experience and I'm sticking with Saturn!
