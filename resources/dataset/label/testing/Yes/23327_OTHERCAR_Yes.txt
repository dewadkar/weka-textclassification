            Since the day I bought my Black '94 Dodge Stealth, I have loved it. I wasn't even shopping for this kind of car, but when I saw it on the lot, I had to test drive it. Once I drove it, I knew I had to buy it. It is a great looking car (especially in red or black). It has the famous Chrysler 7/70 warranty, which is a nice backup.

This car was made for the single guy/gal who loves to drive, and drive fast. Preferably single people with only one friend at a time. More than one passenger is not an option. This is definitely not &quot;your father's Oldsmobile&quot;. There's no room for baby seats, diaper bags, groceries, golf clubs, extra passengers, or even a large suitcase. I often run into the problem of things not fitting in the trunk, and you have to wrestle them into the back seat, or fold down the seats. Also, the window-blind style hatch cover is a real pain in the butt. It is constantly coming out of the moorings and rolling up while you load/unload the trunk. I understand that you can order a part from Dodge that will rectify this, but I've never gotten around to it.

All that said, I still love this car. It's just a lot of fun to drive. I have the manual 5 speed, which makes this experience even better. The car has enough power and speed to really have fun. I've never had trouble pulling out into traffic, or merging onto a busy highway, because when you need power, it's there. When you need good braking, it's there too. The car give good road feedback, and you know when you're approaching the limits, which isn't very often.

Maintenance-wise my Stealth has been very friendly. It has almost 80,000 miles on it, and I've only had trouble with two things: rear wiper motor needs replaced (which I understand is a common problem on many makes/models, and my airconditioning quit. I haven't had that fixed yet, but I know it won't be cheap. You don't buy a sports car, and expect it to be easy on the wallet. Other than that, I've only spent money on gas, oil changes, brake pads, and tires. If you drive like me, you'll spend a lot on gas, tires, and brake pads. :) But what's the fun in having a car like this and driving slow?

OK, so here's the wrap-up:
Have kids: buy a minivan
Wanna carry a bunch of stuff in your trunk: buy a SUV.
Wanna cart around all your friends: buy a minivan or a SUV.
Wanna have a permanent smile plastered to your face while driving: buy a Stealth.
Wanna pass anyone on the road: buy a Stealth.
Wanna speed down winding switch-back roads like they do in the movies: buy a Stealth.
Wanna have a car that looks fast just sitting in the driveway: buy a Stealth.

If they still produced the car, I would not have any qualms about buying a brand new one right now.<br><br>
