            I have owned my 1996 S-10 4WD 5- speed ext. cab 3-door PU for more than 4 years - bought new in May 96 - and it has been a nearly flawless truck. It is my third ext. cab S-10 and second 4WD S-10. The others were equally good. It has been in the shop exactly once, to replace brake pads on the front, at about 40K miles. I found that to be excessive wear as I don't drive the truck that hard, but that has been the only thing I have replaced since new. 

The truck now has 51k on it and continues to operate perfectly. I get about 23 mph on the highway and about 19-20 in the city. The 3rd door is a real blessing and makes the space behind the seat very usable. I will never buy another ext. cab truck  without that 3rd door. 

The 4WD is not used very often, but when it is - we live in upstate NY - it operates perfectly and gets us through snow that simply traps 2WD vehicles. We have a place in the Adirondacks that we use in the winter and we think nothing of plowing through more than a foot of snow on our road in 4WD. It was worth every nickel I paid for it.

 If I had to improve this truck I would get rid of the jump seat in the ext. cab portion - I've never used it and I'm sure it cost me money that I could have used elsewhere. I would make a bug deflector standard - don't drive a truck without one or you'll spend all your time scraping bugs off your windshield. Ditto for the bed liner - it should be standard. I would add some lockable storage inside the cab - there is none - no lock on either the glove box or the console compartment. Newer trucks may have that problem solved. And I would put a tach in it - it's easy to over-rev, especially in the low ranges of 4WD.

Overall I am very pleased with this S10 and in 5 years or so when this one turns 100k I'll definitely buy another one just like it. This one is a duplicate of my 89 except for the 3rd door.<br><br>
