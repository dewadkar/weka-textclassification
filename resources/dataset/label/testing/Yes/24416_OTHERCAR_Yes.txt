            My husband purchased the Sony DSC-S30 for me at Christmas.  I was happy with it, but wanted MORE POWER!  I figured, if you are going to pay that much money for something, what is a couple more hundred dollars?  So, we returned the lower model to Circuit City and picked up the DSC-S50.  All I can say is WOW!!  What a camera!  

We purchased the Sony DSC-S50 mainly because we have a toddler and like to take LOTS of pictures of him.  We just weren't doing that with a regular 35 mm camera because it is such a hassle to pick up film and then remember to take it in to get it developed.  It is nice to just download the pictures to Zing and share them with relatives.  Also, there are so many new services out there that will make actual prints out of your digital pictures, it is just so much more convenient.

Here are the things I love about the Sony DSC-S50 digital camera:

1.  2.1 megapixels allows you to blow your pictures up to 8X10 size.  Not that we are professional photographers, but every now and again we will have a great shot of the kid and would like to have it blown up.  This is a lot cheaper than professional portraits in some cases, depending on where you get them printed.

2.  Long lasting battery:  This battery just won't run out!  I love it!  I have witnessed my in-laws with their older digital camera and it is always an issue to have batteries charged...and then they still find themselves with no more power after a while.  This camera will go for a long long time before you have a problem.  Also, it comes with a great power adapter cord that allows you to recharge quickly or just use the power right from the outlet.

3.  MPEG Digital Movies:  This camera allows you to take short MPEG movies with excellent sound capabilities.  Excellent feature if you have children and grandparents with email!  Just an awesome feature!

4.  Picture altering capabilities:  You can zoom into a picture after it is taken, flip it around, etc before it ever leaves the camera.  This is a great time saving feature.

5.  Powerful Zoom:  This zoom is 6X and really allows you to get up close and personal to your subjects.

6.  Memory Stick:  These memory sticks are fairly economical, although I would have liked a little more powerful stick to come with the camera (it comes with a 4 mb).  No problems uploading pictures to the camera.

7.  Small:  The camera is lightweight and easy to manage.  It has a nifty LCD screen that can be flipped around in any position, including completely around so that you can photograph yourself!

8.  User Friendly:  I am not exactly what you would call an electronic gadget guru, so I was pleased to see how easy this camera was for me to use.  

The only thing I disliked about the camera:

1.  Wish there was a larger memory stick included.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who enjoys photography.  It is especially excellent for those with babies and children.

Thanks for reading my review!  Have a great day!
