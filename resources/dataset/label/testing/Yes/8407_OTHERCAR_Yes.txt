            I have owned this camera now for about 6 months and let me tell you, this brings out the best shots I have ever taken.  It brings out the best light and really leaves brilliant colors in every shot. 

I use this camera for auctions that I have going on all the time for E-Bay and this baby does the job. It takes just a few seconds to download all the pictures you have taken and is so easy to use the workshop for any changes that need to be made.  Because of this camera my online business has boomed and the money has been made up in no time. 

I would highly recommend that you get the AC adapter to save money on batteries, I used batteries the very first day and they went dead after just a few hours.  Spend the extra $20.00 and get it, believe me you will thank me later. If you don't you will find out quickly how much time you do spend with the camera on, so do yourself a favor and get it. 

I would also like to add to all you that are reading this that you can find great deals on E-Bay, I actually purchased mine for only $405.00 and have had no problems at all, none!!! It is a great way to save money so that you can use it on other things like loved ones.
