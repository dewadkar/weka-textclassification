            I bought this vehicle because for the amount of bang you get for the number of bucks you spend it's unbeatable.  When I first bought this vehicle I had a few apprehensions because of the stereo typical boy-racer image. However I must say that I make more heads turn while driving down the street in this car than any other car I've owned.  When
I took my first drive in the car it felt like I was driving a spaceship.  The feeling is amazing.  The car is so quick it follows your mind...as soon as you want to be somewhere else...the car takes you there before your thought finishes. Its a real shame that its being discontinued. I would recommend anyone who wants power at a reasonable price buy this automobile.<br><br>
