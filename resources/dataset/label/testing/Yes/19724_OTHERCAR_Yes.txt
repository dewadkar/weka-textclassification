            This is the first digital camera I purchased for myself though I have used several different kinds in the past.  I can say that it is the best camera you can buy for the money; however, it does have some things that annoy me as well.

First the good news, you may not think that a 1.3 megapixel camera is good for anything but actually you can do quite a bit with 1.3 megapixels...especially if it is good quality.  I mainly use the camera for taking family pictures and my web design business and it is great.  It really shines in a bright outdoor environment.  When it is bright, you can take a quick series of shots without having to wait for the flash to recharge.  The software and USB cable that it comes with allows me to very easily transfer files to my computer and manipulate them.  The Macro mode on this camera is excellent, much better than similar priced models.  I love using the macro mode to take pics of spiders I killed so I can study them...very cool.

Now for the bad.  The very first things you need to do when you buy this camera is 1) buy a larger capacity memory stick (I bought a 32MB module which lets me take around 50 pics at the highest settings) and 2) if you don't want to spend money on Sony's InfoLithium batteries (very expensive) then you MUST at least buy hi capacity NiMH 1800 mAh rechargeables (I bought 4 batteries and a quickcharger).  With these batteries, you will be able to easily fill up the 32MB memory stick and then some in mixed shooting scenarios.

Also, the mpeg movie mode is not all that it is cracked up to be.  For one, unless you are in a very bright outdoor environment, you will get dark movies.  Plus the movies are not very smooth, even the lowest setting does not give good movie quality.  Also without audio, what's the point?  Don't get me wrong, I still do use it from time to time but in no way will it replace my antique analog camcorder.

Another bad thing is that in an indoor or dark environment there is a longer pause between you pushing the shutter button and the picture actually being taken.  I have missed many good shots because of this.  The fix is to keep the shutter pressed halfway but you do have to anticipate the moment which can be difficult.  In an outdoor setting without the flash being used, you have a better response.  The flash is pretty weak too and it's range is very limited.  Finally, I would say that 1 out of 5 pictures that I take indoors or in low-light conditions come out underexposed.  Thankfully I can easily delete those shots and try again.
