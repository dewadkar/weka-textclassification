            First off let me explain that if you, dear reader, knew me, you would know that I'm the type who needs to schedule any spontaneous activity.
 I went looking for a good used car a month back and was sorely disappointed with what was available in my price range.I was making my way home following a particularly bad encounter and decided to stop one last time. I ended up at Sunnyvale Ford (Sunnyvale, Ca.) and test drove a Geo (Please, who designed THAT thing?!?)Needless to say I was completely under-whelmed. Then my salesman suggested a new model that had a first time buyer program. Of course I was skeptical, thinking that any new,entry-level car that needed a push like that was a real loser.
 Amazing how wrong your initial reactions can be, isn't it?.
 I drove a 1991 Escort coupe for 5 years and although practical, it definitely lacked vim &amp; verve. The Focus is brimming with vim, and loaded with verve!.
 It would be hard to describe me as an averaged sized guy, Standing a mere 6' but weighing in at 310lbs (I'm big-boned, really.)I fully expected to scrunch down and squeeze in. No such thing!! I sat right down and actually had to slide the seat forward and telescope the wheel towards me!!!AMAZING!!!. 
 The ZX3 coupe that I test-drove was the one I took home that same night.It has almost everything I wanted, a/c, p/s, ABS, a/t, keyless remotes, alarm,(I thought it was red under the sodium lights in the lot, but it's actually &quot;Autumn Orange&quot;-it grew on me ) the only thing missing were the power windows, but it was close enough. 
 In the 5 weeks since buying it I've put 1,980 miles on it driving everywhere in northern California. from Silicon valley to Sacramento and all over the Santa Cruz mountains. I won't officially state or endorse breaking speed laws but it will do well over 80mph up a steep mountain grade with a/c on, and still have passing speed.(Don't try this at home.)of course the ZX3 has the 2.0 Zetech engine.
 This thing corners like a dream. Very solid breaking (believe me,I know)
and the power-assist rack and pinion steering is TIGHT! 
 So going back to my opening paragraph, it was 3 hours from stepping on the lot (the entire staff at Sunnyvale Ford have to be commended for their help and expertise, thanks all!) to parking it in front of my house.
