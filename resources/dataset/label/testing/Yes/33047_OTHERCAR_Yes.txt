            This vehicle is not just for soccer moms. I bought a 1993 Grand Caravan with 73K. on it. The reason I did so is because I needed a new means of transportation. I thought about buying a truck because I needed more than a car. I thought again that I really didn't need a truck because of the passenger space I would lose. I decided on a van. Full size was a little more than I needed, so I decided to go with the mini. I decided on a Mopar product because of the number of them I saw on the road, and the price. Now mind you I have never been a fan of Chrysler products, but I thought well, who has had the most experience with the mini's and look how many old ones are on the road. I think I made a good choice. It doubles as a large car and a small pickup with a covered box. I can fit an 8 foot step ladder in it by just folding the rear seat down. I should say that I took out the middle seat, because unless you have small children it really is short on leg space. I put a trailer hitch on it and find it to meet all my needs. The front wheel drive is a real plus when driving on snowy roads, or landing a boat. The 3.3V6 has plenty of power. I did have one learning experience though. I seems that the models with the 4 speed overdrive transmissions tend to give up on you between 60K and 100K. Mine did so at 78K. It cost me $1800 for a rebuilt tranny. Watch out for this because they are notorious for this from 91 to 95. Great gas mileage though.<br><br>
