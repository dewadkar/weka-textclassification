            The governor called. The floppy disk has been spared a long, over-due execution. Why? The FD-91, of course. This is a fantastic consumer-grade digital camera for a whole host of reasons - including the fact that it uses inexpensive 3 1/2&quot; floppy disks to store its images on. Just think, you're never out of &quot;film&quot; as long as you have a bunch of cheap disks around. And the added beauty of this medium is instant compatibility with any Macintosh computer that can read PC disks (most can) and no requirement, whatsoever, for cables or complicated transfer software. Shoot images. Insert disks. Begin using images. Really, what could be easier (until we all have memory stick readers in our home PCs). Other reasons why the FD-91 is so slick include the fact that it has a 14x optical Zoom with image stabilization and auto-focus. Take a look at most of the other digital cameras in this price range. How many of them have the optics that equal the Sony? Most offer fixed length lenses, some with 3x zoom. If you thought image size was the only factor to consider in gauging quality, think again. I can't tell you how useful the zoom lens on this camera has been. A large number of the product shots at http://www.altrec.com have come from an FD91. Other great features include an easy-to-use menu system, both a color viewfinder and large color preview LCD panel, built-in flash and a built-in microphone. But why a microphone? Here's another reason why the FD-91 shines. It can take digital movies - with sound! Ok, they're not something Bernardo Bertolucci would create (more like what The Blair Witch Project looks like), but it's still amazing to literally point, shoot and in seconds have a digital movie you can email or post on your web site. The format is MPEG. So there you have it. A versatile camera that's easy to use, has a great lens, uses cheap floppies and has lots of little features that make it a pleasure to use. What could make it better? A hot-shoe for controlling external flash units, more storage per disk (I'm thinking 100MB would be nice!) and, perhaps, a higher resolution than 1024x768 would be great.
