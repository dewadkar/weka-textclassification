            I bought this camera to replace a Nikon 995 and I am more than happy with the results. The image quality from this camera is superb and I am considering finally getting rid of my 35mm equipment. The manual control options and performance are outstanding as is the build quality and the "feel". I had read some concerns over noise but even greatly enlarged I see no problems. I'm not a pro, but I have a decent eye for such things. I love the ability to have 2 different cards in simultaneously and switching from one to the other is as simple as a single button push. The recycling time between shots is much faster than in the last generation cameras and makes this a much more efficient picture taker. The LCD is great even in fairly bright outdoor settings, but the inability to swivel as well as tilt is a detractor. One absolute pain in the butt is the lens cap/power on problem: if you turn the camera on without removing the lens cap, the camera screeches and complains and forces you to turn it back off, remove the cap, and turn it back on. Olympus, are you listening? Additionally, to add lens accessories, you must buy the CLA-1 tube. Why not have the lens barrel threaded instead? The operator's manual stinks, but the CD-based version included is much better. I am a pretty gadget-savvy guy, so learning how to use it was easy for me, but less inclined folks will be irritated by the need to go to the computer to learn the machine. We are still tactile-oriented creatures and like the paper manuals Olympus. Another note: I love that new XD card that comes with the camera. It's tiny and much faster to download than a standard compact flash. It's just too small (32mb). Buy a few more or a big microdrive. Battery life is excellent - I took 265 shots after charging the batteries (NiMH AA's - easy to find) and no recharge was required. As proof of the pudding, I took photos at my niece's wedding recently and got rave reviews about the quality of the shots. Had one enlarged to 11x14 and nobody could tell it was a digital shot. Pretty darn good. Buy it.
