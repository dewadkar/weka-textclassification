            When I first got my DSC-770 in my hands, it felt like I
was holding a 35mm autofocus camera.  The handgrip fits
the hand well and overall, the balance of the camera is
very good.  The controls are easy to understand.
The metal tripod mount was also nice to have.

The camera came with a 8mb memory card which was pitched into the camera bag and replaced with a 64mb card.  An 8mb card is useless if you are planning on shooting in the high mode.  If you shoot in the lower resolution modes, I guess it would be acceptable. The memory stick option is nice to have.  If you fill up a 64mb card, you can pull out the card, push a button and replace the memory stick with another, and keep on shooting.

Another nice feature is the ability to shoot shutter
priority, aperture priority, programmed (camera picks what
it think is the best), and manual (You set it the way you want to).  Also having the choice of ISO 50, 100 and 400
can help sometimes to depending on if you're inside or out.

If you have glasses, the fine focussing lever on the back of the camera where you look through the view finder is nice but I think they could have done without it.  If you set it for yourself and hand the camera to someone else to
shoot, they have to reconfigure the focusing lever for their own vision which becomes a pain. 

One nice feature on this camera is the "Histogram" that
lets you know the balance of light taken on each photo.
Downloading images to your computer is a relative snap.
You take the memory card out of the camera and insert it
into a pc card port adapter which comes with the camera.
The newer flash cards can be quite a bit faster though I
havent tried those yet.

Overall, its a very nice digital camera that can produce
some very nice photos up to the 5x7 range.  I was able to
print some 8X10 pictures that turned out pretty good.  
The manual says that the best photo range is up to 5x7.

I have taken a few photos with the camera that turned out
very nice.  Here is a link to one of them....

Its a nice camera that you can find used on ebay in the
$350-$650 range sometimes.  I got mine from www.buydig.com and got a 7 year protection plan for $39, something also
nice to have.
