            I would recommend this car to anyone, it gets good gas mileage, and it is very stylish almost a year, and haven't had any problems out of it.  Minus the cost for normal up keep and maintenance, this has been a very cheap car to have.  It goes great in snow.  At the cost of less than $9000, this a good car for anyone, especially anyone just starting out, and teenagers just getting their first car.   It rides and drives easy, and is perfect for long trips.  Final Verdict, I give this car an A, you can not go wrong with this car, not at all.<br><br>
