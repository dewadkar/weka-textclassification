            The Audi S4 is a wonderful alternative to the more expensive and more difficult to drive BMW M3. I love BMWs and the M3 is an excellent car, above all with the latest engine. However the Audi is a better car for 97% of the people on the market for this type of car.
The M3 might be a second faster to 60mph and go to 150mph instead of 145 for the Audi, but who's going to drive between 145 and 155 on our roads!? Maybe a few times in 10 years will you actually get there!!! But does that really matter everyday? 

The S4 will take you to 60 in under 6 seconds, and believe me that's a excellent number! It does almost as good as a Porsche BoxterS. The BMW costs a lot more and has a lot bigger engine with more horsepower. The M3's power is a lot more difficult to handle safely for the average person who has no real idea how to drive a sport car and who will hardly find the open space to do so safely.

The truth is that the Audi S4 is a lot quicker than the M3 and Mercedez AMG where it matters: pick up while driving 40 or 50 or even 80. It will take you to the next level faster thanks to his magnificent bi-turbo engine, and the torque which is available from the low range, under 2000rpm. And this matters more than the second you lose at a red light or the 10 miles per hour top speed difference. If you were to race someone you would have more pick up getting out of a turn or passing someone with the Audi. And you would do so in safety.

The Audi has an incredibly efficient All-Wheel drive system which makes the car more accessible to most of us, safer, and more comfortable than the BMW. The key word here is efficient. If you really want to race, you need to be efficient, you can't afford to lose time sliding all over a curve. I have to say that for the fanatics, the Beamer might be more fun and also more dangerous with its rear-wheel drive. Forget about driving fast on rainy days! The really good thing about the Audi is that it will make you feel safe on rainy days and even will take you safely to your destination on snowy roads! A BMW M3 CANNOT do that.

The interior is very traditional, quiet, and comfortable. The materials used are top quality compared to the competition and all parts are put together perfectly. It is very high-quality and also very aesthetic. My only complain for this 4-door car is the rear leg room, but again this is not the car top-priority. I must say that the car will accomodate a family of 4 with two children nicely; the trunk is pretty big. Daddy gets the sport performance in a nice and safe package for the kids!

Finally, a big plus is the newly extended warranty and the price includes the maintenance. So go ahead, test drive it and you won't go look at any other cars! One thing to mention is that AUDI did have some trouble with the electronic parts of its cars in the past.

I do recommend this car over any other comparable sport cars.
Have fun
