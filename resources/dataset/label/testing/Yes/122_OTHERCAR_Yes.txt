            I was interested in getting a digital camera, but hadn't looked into it too seriously when I happened to win this in Dec '99.  It was about $200 new at the time.  I've found the camera to do exactly what I need it to, but with today's new features and detail, this one is starting to show its age.

For those of you looking for a simple camera to use for eBay sales, website pictures, etc., this camera is perfect.  Just out of the box, you can start taking nice pictures.  It has a 2x zoom and a decent flash.  Once your picture is taken, you can look at it on the screen and zoom in and move around in it to check out the detail.  From there, you can delete the picture if you don't like it, or protect it from accidently being deleted.  Pretty much all of the functions you will find on this camera can be found on all other decent cameras.

From using the camera, here are some things I would suggest to a potential buyers.  Don't buy this camera if you plan on taking lots of outdoor photos.  First, the zoom isn't enough to get a decent shot, and secondly, this camera can rip though batteries pretty fast, especially if you use the digital display on the back to frame your shot.

Also, to get the most use out of the camera, you may have to buy a couple accessories.  First, you need some kind of device to get your photos from the camera to your computer.  Either a cable or a fake floppy disk can do the trick.  I bought a floppy disk type thing, and you slide the memory card into the disk and put it in a normal 3.5 inch drive.  It works very well.  If you use the serial cable option, you'll need an AC adaptor.  It will save your batteries and you should probably use one anyway if you are taking pictures inside.

Overall, I'd say this camera would be great for a first time digital camera buyer with a small budget just looking to take indoor pictures to use on the internet.  That's what I've mainly used the camera for, and have been very happy with it in the year since I got it.<br><br>
