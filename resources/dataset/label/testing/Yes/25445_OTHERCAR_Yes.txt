            If you have some money (more than $35000) and you want to buy a new car, a lot of problems appears: where to buy, how to buy, and, the most important question, WHAT?
You can buy Mers, BMW or an other dutch car, but relation between quality and price is low. For example BMW 318i has a price about $30 thousands. Yea, it's bueatiful, but engine with volume 1,8l... You can buy Japan car (Nissan primera, for example), but it&#146s not so imposing as Swedish Car.
At first I was a passenger in this car. There are very bad roads in Russia, but I hadn&#146t feel pits at all. Very comfortable, a lot of free space on front and back sits, beautiful leather saloon &#150 you will enjoy to be in this car by Volvo.
Later I gone to saloon and test S80 as a driver. I was astonished by feelings, which appeared when I drive this car. My driver&#146s place become comfortable in few seconds due to automatically regulated sit place and steering-wheel. Electronic mirrors provide wide field of vision, and you can see all around simultaneously.
When I pressed the accelerator, no sound appears inside the car although two windows were opened. Car began move fast but easy, and I even didn&#146t understand at first that I moved. 5- or 6-th cylinders engines with power 170-270 h.p. make driving very dynamic and fast. STC &#150 anti skidded system, system of dynamic stabilization (DSTC) and powerful brakes with ABS make driving very pleasure. 
As everyone know, Volvo &#150 one of safest cars in the world. Specialists of this company always looked for safety of drivers and passengers. Volvo S80 isn&#146t an exception to this rule. SIPS, WHIPS, IC &#150 inflating curtains, all sits with belts of safety &#150 here is not full list of safety systems of this car.
After short trip I was enjoyed and I bought this car. I have been driving  this car for several months already and I&#146m very glad of my choice. 
At last, I have to say that price isn&#146t high for the car of this class and quality &#150 about $38-40000, and the best car from this model row &#150 Volvo S80 executive &#150 have a price only $50000! For comparison, I can say, that the cheapest new BMW 745 (the same class of cars) have a price about 90000 euro. No comments.
