            I purchased my 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport brand new a little over 2 years ago.  I was graduating from college and was excited about purchasing my first new vehicle.  I drove a Honda throughout college (which I loved) but I was ready for something bigger and more rugged.  Having just graduated, the price was a major selling point for me.  I found the Cherokee Sport to be a great value.  It had a lot of the same options as other SUV's like the Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee, but at a much lower price.  

With this being my first car that I was purchasing on my own, I did a lot of research before I purchased the Jeep.  I found some reviews that questioned the reliability of the Jeep Cherokee.  I have had absolutely no problems with my Jeep though - it has proven very reliable and I have done nothing to it but routine maintenance (it now has 45K miles on it).  I did purchase the extended 100K mile warranty but have not used it at all.  My sister owns a 1996 Cherokee that has been very reliable as well.  Her Jeep has over 100K miles on it and has only had routine maintenance as well.  And that's saying a lot because she's a college student who often does not keep it regularly maintained.  Yet, it keeps on running without a hitch.

The Jeep is very comfortable to drive.  I am 5'2" so I often have trouble with visibility in other cars.  I love driving the Jeep - I sit up high and have no blind spots.  The seats are comfortable and there's a pretty good amount of room in the cabin.  The leg room can get a bit cramped in the back seat but I've noticed this problem in the more expensive SUV's too.

The Jeep has a lot of pep and is fun to drive.  It accelerates quickly and smoothly and makes it very easy to pass slower cars.  My husband and I purchased a pop-up camper earlier this year.  The Jeep has been great when we tow the camper - it tows very well.  We added the all-terrain tires and like to test the Jeep's ruggedness when we camp - driving through streams, rocky areas, etc. - it never fails us.

I love all the room in the Jeep.  I love being able to buy furniture, things from Home Depot, etc. and not worry about whether I'll be able to bring them home.  One complaint, however, is that the rear window does not open.  If it did, the Jeep would be even more versatile.

The AC and heat work great in the Jeep.  I drove my Honda for 5 years and they definitely don't have the best AC's.  The Jeep is another story though.  It works so well that I often cannot keep the AC on the very coldest setting or the heat on the very highest setting (even when it's blowing on Lo).  And my AC gets a good workout in the Georgia heat!

One of the few complaints I have is with the cargo cover.  The cover in the Cherokee snaps in four different places and it's often difficult to get it to stretch across the whole cargo area without really pulling on it.  My mom owns a Grand Cherokee and they have much nicer covers - they stay in place and you can slide them over your cargo area (much easier!).

I've been impressed with Jeep's ability to make their owners feel like a "family".  They're constantly having events such as Camp Jeep, etc. where people drive their Jeeps hundreds, even thousands of miles, to participate in events and meet other Jeep owners.  I've never seen anything like this with other manufacturers.  I think this goes to show how much the owners love their Jeeps.

I was disappointed that Jeep discontinued the Cherokee.  However, I would definitely consider a Liberty or a Grand Cherokee when I'm ready to trade.
