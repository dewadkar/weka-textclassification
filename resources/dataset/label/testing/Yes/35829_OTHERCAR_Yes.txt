            48 miles per gallon!!!  That's all that I should have to say about this one!!  But since these have to be 75 words in length I'll say more :)

Three years ago my parents bought a Saturn.  It was such an awesome car.  They still have it and it has been one of, if not the most, reliable cars they've ever owned!  I drove it, but Saturn never really had that personal thing until this past summer when I got my own.

I have found my own Saturn to not only be the most reliable but also the most gas efficient that I have ever driven.  When I drive it normally I get at least 40 mpg (mostly 43) and when I baby it ... 48!!!  Now if you can find another car that's anywhere close to that then I'll shake your hand!

This is a car that is definitely outta this world!!
