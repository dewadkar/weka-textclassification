            If you're in the market for underwater digital camera, you'll quickly find that your choices are very very limited.

Cybershot U60 is Sony's entrance into the rugged, sports aficianado market segment. Its list of accolades is somewhat limited at no optical zoom, 2 megapixels, not- quite small not-quite big size, good amount of pre-set scene selections and AAA batteries with recharging unit.

The form factor is a love hate thing. Its not a big digital camera but certainly no match for its U30/U20 cousin. Its designed for a one-hand operation. Which means everything button is well within reach when taking pictures with one hand. That is, if you have a big hand. Since I have a small hand, full operation is very do-able, but involves a bit of stretching. I don't like that. The case is 100% plastic. No rubber anything so if you're thinking that you drop this "rugged" camera on the ground and expect everything to be honky-dory, you better have a few $300 to burn in the bank account. Another issue I have is with its lack of lens cap. I don't want to beat a dead horse but COME ON!

2 megapixels won't wow anyone anymore in this day and age. Actually, if anything, its on the low end of the scale. When taking pictures, you'll find that quality is your standard Sony vivid-ism. It has the typical over-pronounced red and green and blue which makes it very easy to take good pictures. But also very hard to take spectacular pictures. Having said that, you're snorkling somewhere, the last thing you have time for is setting up for the perfect shot. So in this case, the vividness of it is a very welcome feature. The pictures are sharp and clear, the flash unit does not "white wash" everything. I did not print any pictures but I suspect with most 2 megapixels, a 8x10 would be a serious stretch.

From operation standpoint, its very easy to use. The menu's are logical, the controls are logical and LCD screen is well lit. The start up time is quick, probably faster than most digital cameras on the market. So if you need that snap shot quickly, this will get you there. The battery life is decent considering they're 2 AAA's. The obvious advantage is you can get emergency spare batteries anywhere. The disadvantage is that you don't have the longevity of lithiums. So in this case, NiMH (nickel metal hydrides) are highly recommended. Oh, you have to use the camera in one hand, vertical. Its kinda weird, takes a little bit of getting used to. 

Its a Sony digital camera and thus it uses Memory Stick or Memory Stick Pro. So far, memory stick has been a big joke. Only a couple of months ago did you see 256meg sticks while both CF/SDMM/SM have been flirting with consumer level 1 gigabyte ones. Right now, memory sticks are pricier than alternatives but at least they're not price gouging you. An 8meg is included in the box but obviously that won't do for all intents and purposes.

The U60 is rated good for up to 1meter or 5 feet of water. Since water pressure increases exponentially as you go deeper, I wouldn't test those numbers beyond the design. So basically its good for snorkling and fishing and most water sports. The enclosures for the batteries and memory stick doesn't seem to be well sealed. Its a "clip-lock" mechanism with a circumferential rubber ring. Will probably do for 5 feet but just doesn't seem like it'll handle much more than that.

Conclusion:

The camera was a bit bigger than I had expected. I guess I was hoping for it to be around the U20/U30 size. The picture quality is above average for that megapixel and that price range. The lack of "some" optical zoom is a disapointment but certainly not a deal breaker. Face it, a 2x zoom is same as taking 5 steps forward anyways. The underwater feature is obviously the selling point. Thus my official recommendation is this. If you have the necessity for a waterproof/underwater digital camera, there is no better choice anywhere near this price range. Go ahead and buy this without reservation. However, if you have no foreseeable need for the water feature, then there's no reason for you to get this camera. A U30 or U20 is a much more "wow" and "cool" camera.
