            I recently was given a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu to use as a loaner while my truck was in service.  I have to admit I was skeptical, having pictured this car to be similar to the Malibus and Celebrities of the 1980's.  What a shock!!!

This was a fully loaded LS model, complete with V-6, power everything, cruise and a killer stereo.  The stereo allows you to set the tone based upon the music style you are listening to, such as jazz, country, pop and others.  The unique dashboard has the ignition in the dash, like cars from the 60's. The lights turn themselves on at dusk AND there is a cupholder on the LEFT hand side of the dashboard.  The only drawback to that is one tends to hit it when activating the turn signals.

The ride is very smooth and comfortable, the engine responsive and overall the car has a tight, well put together feeling where all of the components come together in perfect symmetry.<br><br>
