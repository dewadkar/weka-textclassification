            If you're in the market for a safe, comfortable family sedan, and don't mind giving up some style to keep the lease payments at around $200/month, go test drive the Century. You'll get more features for your dollar than with an Accord or Camry.

My wife and I needed to trade in her Toyota Celica for a family sedan, in preparation for the arrival of our first child this past fall. We considered the Camry, Accord, and Malibu. The Century ended up being the most car for the money. The Malibu was a little cramped. Adding a V6, ABS, and traction control to the Camry and Accord (things I considered to be minimum safety requirements--a 4 cyl. engine in a midsize car, with passengers and the A/C running, is a road hazard) sent their prices to $24,000 or above. 

We've driven the Century for 3,000 miles so far, and LOVE it. It's a very comfortable highway and around-town cruiser. I highly recommend the power driver's seat; my wife is only 5'2&quot;, and she is able to raise the seat to get a good view all around. There's plenty of power for merging onto the highway (we have the 3800 V6 engine), the switchgear is laid out well (we also got the steering whell mounted stereo controls, which I also highly recommend), and the trunk and interior space are very good.

My only complaint is the conservative (some might say boring) styling, but that seems to be true of most of the bread-and-butter midsize sedans. Oh, and the other drawback: Most of the Centurys we see are being driven by older folks. Hey, maybe it just means they know something younger folks don't.
