            After some unfortuate problems with a loan gone bad on a previous vehicle I decided to purchase a used 1998 Chevrolet S-10 Extended Cab.  It was a very good buy the vehicle had only 10K miles in only two years!!  About 3 months of ownership and one trip to Los Angeles, CA and Las Vegas, NV, I began to experience some transmission trouble.  The truck began to rev at a high RPM and was very sluggish when driving 65MPH.  About one week after the Vegas trip I took the Truck to Watson Chevrolet in Tucson, AZ.  I had Cody Penrod as my service advisor.  I had some bad luck with trying to service the truck at O'Rielly Chevrolet where I bought the S-10 at.  So I decided to try Watson's service.  Cody was very helpful and nice to my and bad situation.  At that moment I felt that I should have stuck with another foriegn car, cause I had not trouble with it.  But I sent the truck in for service, Mr. Penrod assured me that everything would be fine and the warranty would take care of everything.  That it did!!!  One week later I picked up my baby (truck). It sounded like it was brand new.  Just 1/8th of a mile away from the lot and the rattling that was in the cabin was gone.  The driver's side seat was re-upholstured because of abnormal wear on the seat bottom.  The rear view mirror was replaced.  Also the most important was the Transmission!!  Good as new!!  I have since driven 3,000 more miles since the repairs and I was highly satisfied that the Chevrolet 3/36 bumper to bumper warranty really took very good care of me and my truck!!!  I was not without a vehicle, I was told that Watson Chevy has an award winning service department.  And my service advisor Cody Penrod was in my opinion a very good employee!!  My truck was all fixed up with no money out of my pocket!!  I now plan on my next vehicle to be a Chevrolet!!!<br><br>
