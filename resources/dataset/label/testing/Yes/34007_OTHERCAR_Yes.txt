            The 1996 Tacoma.  A truly wonderful truck.  My mother purchased this truck.  She loves it still.  The truck has some customizations to it that are wonderful!  She had the paint detailed on the truck and custom tires.  This has made the ride on this truck even smoother than before.  If I could buy this truck from her I would.  I don't like the newer models with the oversized headlights.  The '96 is the best.

The pick and go of this truck is something else.  I never thought this much power could come out of a 4 cylinder vehicle.  It has great handling and great response.  Even though the handling is great the steering is a little sloshy.  It takes some time to get use to.  

Not only is it stylish, compact and powerful.  The actual noise level is low, unless you roll down the windows then you hear the sound of a miniature power plant.  It a baby testosterone vehicle.  For those ladies that really like some power in a small size, this is your truck.  

For the guys that like to have a truck but don't need the gas guzzling power house this would be great for you too.<br><br>
