            I received my used '91 Nissan two years and it has been quite the little fighter for us.  It has held up well, no major problems and it's not too shabby on gas.  This car has always held it's own against more expensive vehicles.  The only downfall I've found so far is the fan belt breaks often which causes the car to overhead until we replace.  I feel that this is due, in part, to our geographical location.  We live in Phoenix which can be pretty rough on cars in the summer.

Other than regular maintenance and having to purchase a new fan belt now and then, this vehicle has never had any major difficulties.  The are over a hundred thousand miles on and it shows no signs of slowing down.

The exterior is really dated, and I've noticed on thing about Nissans.  They seem to keep the same mold for a few years before they create something new, so it is hard to distinguish my '91 to say, an '87 Sentra.   But, when you're looking for a car, and you need the price to be right this really is not going to be much of an issue.  I'd recommend this car to most anyone that was looking for a compact car that is reliable.
