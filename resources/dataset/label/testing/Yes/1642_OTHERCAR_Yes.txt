            I have been looking to buy me a new car and i  test drove the 2000 Chevrolet Prizm.  it was a nice ride, it was smooth,quite it was just a relaxing drive. I loved the four doors on it, i used to be against driving anything with four doors but this car made me forget about that.  But i did find a problem, i got onto the freeway and i had the AC on which was a problem.  for some reason it slowed the car down. i had to turn the AC off to get anywhere on the freeway. but besides that i Loved The 2000  Chevrolet Prizm. I think this is a great car for newly wed couple or as a teens first car. <br><br>
