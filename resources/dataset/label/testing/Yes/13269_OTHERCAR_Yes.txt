            I owned an 89 Accord LXi 5 speed for a couple years before purchasing the 99 Accord EX 5 speed to replace it.  In some respects I regret it, but then I see her parked under a streetlight at night and the car just looks (dare I say) sexy!  The dark green paint has a beautifully deep color to it that requires merely a wash to look fantastic...wax it to *really* make the car shine.  

Relative to the 89, there's more power available under my go-foot (150hp vs. 124hp).  Doesn't sound like much, but match it up with a comparable increase in torque and the incredible sensation of the VTEC kicking in and you're afraid of nobody.  Like someone else said, you're almost always driving faster than you intend.

The drivers seat, once set for me, has been great.  I drive an awful lot in this car (one trip was from Pennsylvania to Connecticut to North Carolina and back to PA) and have never emerged with any strange back pains even after sitting for 7 hours straight.  my back seat passengers do not echo my sentiments though...they say it's too upright and not at all soft.  Maybe if they sat there for a few thousand miles it would feel the way they want ;-)

I do wish that the 99 had the handling ability of the 89.  The size of the car is one significant factor; it feels so much larger.  Sure it weighs more too.  But you can tell that honda designed this with the American driver in mind: narrower steering wheel, chrome accents, huge speedo for the aging populace, cushier ride, and &quot;green&quot; tires.  I didn't have anything against Michelin before this car, but i'm going to be replacing the tires soon.  Sure, they're fine on nice smooth asphalt, but the Michelin's really don't like wet roads and are absolutely boomy on concrete road beds.  They've been like this since day one; i know it's not a wear issue...i've been counting the days until I can justify getting rid of them.  Props to Michelin for tread life, no doubt helped by regular tire rotation.  Not sure if i'll attempt to put Dunlop D60s on the car or not.  My parents always insist on me driving whenever we get together--they're constantly impressed with how smooth and silent the car is.

As far as fit and finish, my car was delivered with only one small problem with the clock and it was replaced under warranty.  Everything else is perfect.  After almost 45000 miles, I can assure anyone out there that this car still looks and feels like 00016 miles when i picked it up(and even smells like it too!).  I went through all the scheduled maintenance up to 36000 (the end of the warranty period) and now i'm doing only oil changes and major service intervals.  I plan on keeping this car around for a good while.  Honda certainly built it with that in mind.<br><br>
