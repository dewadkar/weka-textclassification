            I bought this camera a week ago after doing much research finding the best price. There is such a wide range of prices for this camera, but I did find it for about $180 which is pretty great.

I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness of it. It's light but not flimsy; has a great LCD screen (which I wasn't expecting), 4 different flash settings and a removable 8mb memory card. It's cute, too. Love the blue casing. :)

As for the picture quality, I am pretty pleased. There are 4 different resolution levels, but it seems that only the highest one is really acceptable. I bought the camera to post pictures on the web and to just play around with. For these purposes, the quality is nice. 

The flash seems a bit overbearing at times, and often overexposes my close ups. This is a problem because without the flash, its completely underexposed. I end up having to take the picture from farther away,  just so the flash won't overpower my photo. 

The other thing I don't like about the camera is the software. It's slow and lacks alot of features I need. I end up transferring all of my pictures into Photoshop to play with them. Their software is really good for nothing. 

Overall, I think you get alot for the price of this camera. If you're not looking to get extremely serious with the digital photography and would rather just play around, this would be a wonderful buy.<br><br>
