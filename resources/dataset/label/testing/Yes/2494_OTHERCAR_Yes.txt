            I am a proud owner of a 1995 Hyundai Elantra GLS. I bought my car in 1997 when it was two years old and it only had 25,000 miles on it. This is certainly a great car for a first time buyer and it is great at the gas pump!!!! HA HA!!!! Reasonably priced (under $6000 used), this car is equiped with radio, heat, air, electric windows and doors, overdrive,driver side airbag, child safety features, cruise control, several colors to choose from ( Mine is burgundy with silver trim)etc, etc..... This vehicle is smooth sailing when it comes to road trips or simply just driving to the mall or the gym. :o) I would certainly recommend this car to just about anyone. It is not too big (sedan size) so it is very easy to judge visability. So, if you have a teenager just starting to drive, you can feel safe buying him/her the Elantra. HAPPY CAR SHOPPING!!!!!!
