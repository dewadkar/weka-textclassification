            VTEC engine with 240 horse power and 50 states ULEV.  I averaged about 19 MPG in the city (17 city / 23 hwy). The interior has versatile seating configuration and cargo space. Fold down seats are the best (2 row -60/40 3rd row 50/50). The stereo system from the touring package is almost as good as my E320 sedan. 2000 RPM cruising @70 mph.

Above 60 mph, the car has excessive wind noise. It feels light at high speed. There is no side molding to protect this vehicle from door dings. Some leather or plastic squeaks over road bumps. The value of the car is not as much as you hope, because you have to pay full MSRP price + marked up accessories. You should be able to negotiate $3000 to $4000 off MSRP on RX300 or ML320. The rear looks like a minivan.
