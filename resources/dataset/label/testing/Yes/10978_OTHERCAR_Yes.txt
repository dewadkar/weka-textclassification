            We finally found the truck that has plenty of room for us!  We bought our suburban after looking and waiting for just the right one to come along.  It finally did and we love riding in that truck!  We have 3 small children and have been wanting something to carry all of us plus extra passengers.  This truck has more than enough room for all of us, plus guests, plus lots of cargo space.  There is no lack of leg room and the back seats keep the kids far enough away from each other!  There are many of extras such as rear air/heater controls, and lots of places to put drinks and snacks.  It will be a great vehicle for our vacation travels as it makes trips just locally so much nicer.  The gas mileage really isnt that much different that our Cherokee.  It just takes a lot of gas to fill it up.  We love it and will not be without!
