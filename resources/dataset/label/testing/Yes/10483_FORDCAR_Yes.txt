<TEXT>
                 I &quot;inherited&quot; my 1993 Ford Ranger from my father; he no longer needed a pickup truck, and since my car from high school was becoming a clunker, it was passed on to me.  It was the first standard vehicle I'd ever driven, and it was easy to learn on.  
     As a tall female, one complaint that I have about the truck is that it's definitely not made for those with long legs!  I head hits the ceiling, and my father had to add a tilt steering wheel to accomodate my legs.  My only other complaint is that it only has a 4 cylinder engine, and it's VERY difficult to maneuver while climbing steep hills, mountains, etc.  It takes forever to gain speed on the road, and it will not go past 85 mph (which is bad for speed demons like me. :)
     I must say that it's been a very reliable truck, though.  The bumpers are definitely very strong (because I've had several people rear-end me, with no dents).  It's a comfortable truck, and an easy truck to start out with.<br><br>
