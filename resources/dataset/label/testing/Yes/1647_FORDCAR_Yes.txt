              I have been waiting twenty years for Ford to make this vehicle.  And all I can say now is, &quot;It's About Time&quot;.  When we received the news that our family was growing again we realized we needed a bigger vehicle but the only solution seemed to be a minivan because my wife feels uncomfortable driving large vehicles.  However after serious thought and persuasion I convinced my wife to test drive the Excursion and to her surprise, and mine, she loved it! It drives like a car or at least like an Explorer.  This vehicle is so easy to handle and the ride is so smooth it feels like a dream!

The standard features are incredible.  You really don't need to add anything to get a vehicle well worth its price.  However the reverse sensing system is a must if you want to have the added security of knowing your wife won't run over the dog (or anything else) in the driveway. 

The cargo space in totally unreal.  The Excursion is like having a bus, for the passenger room, and a full size truck bed for hauling plywood or other materials.  Seating is very comfortable and easily entered even for a tall person like myself.  Keyless entry is especially nice to have in rainy areas like Oregon.  You have your choice of three engine sizes, 5.4 V8, 6.8 V10 or the 7.3 V8 Turbo diesel.  We chose the V10 purely for the extra 'get up and go'.  

I will not apologize for putting my family in a vehicle that is safe and secure. Being a father of four I would never trust my family to a minivan that would crumble in an accident.  In the Excursion I can trust that my family will be ok in the average accident. Also Ford has designed this vehicle so that in the event of a run in with a smaller vehicle, the smaller vehicle should not go underneath.  

The price of this vehicle is well worth it if you consider the facts of comfort, saftey and reliability of the Ford name.  I will say though, that if you are looking at this vehicle for gas mileage, your looking in the wrong place.  3/4 ton trucks have never gotten very good mileage and they probably never will.Where else can you find a vehicle of this quality that will last you from the time your first child is born, to the time your last one gets married, and beyond.

Update; We have about 6000 miles on are truck. We just got home from a 2000 mile trip. 13hours in one day each way. Took my mom and dad with us, 
they are both 73 years old. They were very surprise how comfortable the trip was. We are getting 11.7 mpg daily driving and 14.7 on are trip at 80mph. Love This Truck!
