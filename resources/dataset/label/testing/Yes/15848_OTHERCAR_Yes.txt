              Hello all!  I just thought I would drop in my opinion of this superb sport utility vehicle!  It can hold up to 9 people, depending on whether or not you have bucket or bench seats in the front.  It's great for hauling kids to soccer, band, ballet, or anything else.  It comes with the option of an awesome stereo system that's complete with tape player, compact disc player, and radio.  On the later suburbans there's power windows and locks and anti-lock brakes that work at the slightest tap.  Once you start to drive it you'll feel like you're king, or queen, of the road!!<br><br>
