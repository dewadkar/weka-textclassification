            Sony has long been known for innovative products and this camera is a perfect example.  They've built with your hands in mind as every control on the body is easily accessible without needing to look at where you need to press.

This camera has since been 'upgraded' to a newer version with the same megapixel range but I've recently purchased this model instead for a few reasons.

Firstly it feel like a camera!  While still quite small it doesn't get lost in your hands.  It's large enough to prevent fingers getting in the way, and heavy enough to feel as if you're holding a quality product.  

It's later model has also done away with many of the external buttons, prefering you to use the onscreen menu instead.  Personally I prefer to be able to quickly push a button than scroll through options to get where I want.

The supplied 4meg memory stick is a bit of a turn off compared to the size of sticks for sale, but you can still get 50 photos onto the card itself at 800x600 which is still better than most film 'point and shoot' cameras.

The mpeg video option is great.  Just slide the switch on top of the camera and you go from still to motion video instantly.  Press the shutter and it'll record for 5 seconds, keep holding and it'll record till the memory fills.  Fantastic.

The LCD screen on the back is the only option for viewing what you're photographing, but you get used to this quickly.  The screen is bright and clear and easy to work with in most lighting conditions.  It also swivels up and over to face toward the front of the camera for self portraits.

The build quality is high, and feels solid.  I've dropped mine once and it survived the fall happily with no ill effects.  Buttons and switches feel strong and don't become loose with use.  The side door which houses the battery and memory stick is elegant and functions well.

The later version of this camera reportedly has no lithium battery or charger supplied.  Sony products eat batteries quickly so this earlier version will save an extra $80 or so in 'accessories' by having them sold with the unit.

Photo quality is excellent.  Clear and well colored.  Some work is needed to set environmental conditions for the best results compared to simpler point and shoot cameras but you pick it up fast and can quickly adapt to your environment.

Downloading the camera is as simple as installing two drivers.  The camera acts as a removable drive which you select from explorer.  Highlight the images and/or video and drag to your computer.  Emptying the camera is as simple as selecting the images from the 'drive' and hitting delete.
