            Well, it is the first new car I'd ever bought, but it is still a great car.

Before I begin, I have to make a comment to epinions here. The Ford Focus should not be listed solely under the wagon category and at the time I'm writing this, a four door model pictured is described as a ZX3 hatchback.

As I mentioned above, this is a great car. I paid just $300 over invoice and I'm generally happy with the deal I made. I bought the ZX3 3 door hatchback model. At the time I purchased it, Ford was running a rebate on 2000 models. After searching most of eastern PA, I was told by a dealer that the ZX3's are selling that well that it is near impossible to find a leftover. The $1000 rebate would have been nice, but I qualified for a $400 recent graduate rebate which helped out quite nicely.

I'll start off first with what I don't like about the car, in most annoying to least annoying order. My first complaint is a big one. I bought the base model which of course is a 5-speed manual transmission. Which I prefer over the automatic. But, even thought the shift pattern is relatively tight and friendly, it is a little mushy with gates that are not ideally defined. My last car was a Ford Mustang with a 2.3 liter and a four speed manual that was beat. The gears were widely spaced, but the gates were well defined. You would have to be asleep to miss a shift. Overall, I think a little bit of time with the car and I will become accustomed to the shifter and we can be friends.

There are a lot of simple interior things that really make me want to ask Ford, &quot;Why?&quot; Like the flat bottom on the ashtray. Just after buying the car I took the PA turnpike to visit my girlfriend. After going through the toll booth I stuck my ticket in the ashtray, something I think is common. When I was coming out the other side it took me near two minutes to get the ticket off the bottom of the tray. I could image this causing problems with people that store change in their ashtray as well. Why isn't the front of the ashtray sloped upward to get things out of it easily? A lame complaint of mine is that the button for the windshield washer just seems too little and wimpy. I feel as though it is something that will break off in the future. My last complaint for now is that the car is front wheel drive. This is my first front drive car and I think I will have to spend some time with it to get used to its oddness. Oh, how this car would have rocked if Ford had used the same all wheel drive system used in their World Rally Foci.

Now, if these things are actually enough to make you question buying one of these cars, please read on. I really love this car. It was a great deal at less then $13,500 including tax, fees and interest. Not only is it a good value, but the car is a blast to drive. It handles surprisingly well. With the optional 205/40 tires I'm sure it would even handle better. The car has plenty of power when pushed. If you have read other review, it is true that the power really doesn't pick up until at least 3000 RPM but the well selected gear ratios do a good job of keeping you there. I'm sure after market parts will be able to bring up the low end of the little four cylinder. That is if you have the heart (and more importantly, wallet) to tear into modifying a new car. Even off the lot the car has enough get up to keep most satisfied. The radio is very impressive for a factory unit. the CD is standard and I have yet to hear it skip. The speakers handle a broad band of frequencies. I've tried out the lows with Beck and Sublime and they handled very well. The sound produced is smooth, but many will require some type of sub-woofer system to add a little needed kick. I have read some people report of poor gas mileage with their Foci. So far I have only gone through two tanks of gas and have observed about 31 MPG in mixed city and highway driving. If driven reasonably, I'm sure the car can consistently achieve good mileage.

The driver seats are great. The ZX3 has standard buckets up front and I love them. The back seat looks a little cramped, but I haven't spent anytime back there. People that have ridden in my car say that they are surprisingly comfortable. The ZX3 is a hatchback and I was blown away with just how much storage room is available. The rear seats fold down allowing access into the hatch compartment creating a large luggage space. I first thought it was an optical illusion looking into so much space in such a small looking car.

Well, I've only had my car for six days at the time I'm writing this, but I have logged on over 750 miles. As I have stated before, the car is a blast to drive. I would recommend the ZX3 to just about anyone for a good value in an automobile. 

As I spend more time with the car I will be adding to this review.<br><br>
