            On May 4, 1999, my wife was involved in an accident with our 1997 Corolla CE. This vehicle performed tremendously, folding just as its manufacturer intended. Although the front end collision totaled the car, I was more than impressed with the safety characteristics of this vehicle, and based on its performance, we replaced it with a 1999 model. You can be assured that, as long as you have your seatbelt on and locked, this vehicle will do its part in keeping you in one piece. Thanks, Toyota, for a great car!<br>
