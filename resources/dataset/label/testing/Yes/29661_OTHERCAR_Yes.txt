            I've owned most of them in recent years including full-sized conversion vans, a Windstar, 2 Suburbans and more. 

Without question, the T&C Limited is the best combination of people hauling, stuff-hauling, comfort, luxury, performance, price, economy, styling and price.

The ride and quiet compares with the 2002 Cadillac Seville I rented 2 weeks ago and drove 700 miles.

The economy is at least 50% better than my 2000 Suburban I traded in.

The quality compares with the Mercedes I drove several years ago.

In short... this vehicle has it all at a price I can live with.

Before you buy a minivan, full-sized van or SUV... you owe it to yourself to test-drive a Town & Country.
