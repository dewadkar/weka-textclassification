               A Jeep is more than a vehicle.  A Jeep is a way of life.  A Jeep symbolizes freedom in the purest sense.  The new Wrangler TJ models are the newest in the Jeep heritage.
   The TJ models (1997+) replace the leaf spring suspension with a coil spring suspension that offers superior articulation and improved ride quality.  The interior has been redesigned.  The TJ's exterior has been refined and the TJ's also go back to the round headlight look.
   Jeep Wranglers were not designed for comfort.  You should look elsewhere if you want luxury items.  The Wranglers are designed to be excellent off-road and good on-road.
   However, if you're looking for a fun, reliable vehicle then the Wrangler is the vehicle for you.  A Jeep will change the way you think of vehicles.  Very few people can go back once they feel the Jeep experience.<br>
