            Simple, non-flashy, rugged exterior.  Simple yet fun colors available (mine is blue).  I traded in my 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee for the Element.  I have dogs, and we go everywhere together.  I'm looking forward to not having to get my carpet steam cleaned three times a year as there IS NO CARPET in the Element.  No floor mats come with it either.  You can buy those separately.  The dials are simple and easy to read.  Stereo and climate controls are easy to reach.  Lower ground clearance than a CRV by a few inches, but the adjustable driver seat height gives you a bird's-eye view of the road ahead and behind.  There is ample leg room, and the low ground clearance makes the back seats more accessible.  SUV space and versatility in a neat package.  
More than enough power for everyday urban driving.  A little road noise, but then again it's not the most aerodymanic vehicle out there.  Nice turning radius.
One major flaw is the lack of ESSENTIAL standard equipment to us southerners.  AIR CONDITIONING!!  I was shocked to hear that AC wasn't standard!  
Honda also needs to include some base-level stereo.  Mine has a two speaker CD player/AM FM Tuner installed by the dealer. 
Where are my vanity mirrors?
