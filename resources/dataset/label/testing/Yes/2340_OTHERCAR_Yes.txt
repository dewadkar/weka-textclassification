            We bought this camera with only about 20 minutes of research and lucked out. The picture quality is superb, the USB interface is a joy (w/Win98), and the user interface is intuitive.

We got this before our honeymoon and took a laptop with us on a cruise. We got a 32MB card and *boom* infinite pictures! You can take an entire days' worth of shots because as you run low on memory, just crank the resolution down. Then download the images to your laptop, and you're ready to go again.

I would like it if the battery life were a little longer, but at least when you plug it in, the camera recharges itself automatically--no switching or fiddling with batteries.<br><br>
