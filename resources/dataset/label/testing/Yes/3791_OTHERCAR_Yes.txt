            The BMW M3 is a sleek, smooth, fast racing machine.  Well it's not actually a race car, but it almost goes as fast as one and has a lot more style.  The interior of the M3 is high-tech, with tiptronics transmission and a quiet ride.  You can either have a hard top or let your hair blow in the wind with the convertible.  

The ride is smooth and quiet.  Unlike most cars it is fast and you do not have to listen to all of the outside noises that the big trucks make.  As you fly by the cars on the highway they will surely look twice at you in your stylish car.  It is fast off the line, and you don't have to worry about being challenged by other cars because you will blow them off the road.

I purchased the BMW M3 because of its stylish look and its amazing speed.
I have always heard great things about the car but never fully experienced it until I got in the M3. I recommend this car for all ages because the fast speed and it will surely attract girls. 

The BMW M3 surely fulfills your need for speed<br><br>
