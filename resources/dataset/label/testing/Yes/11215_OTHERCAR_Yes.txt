            Wow, empty nester very soon.  Do I need a van to transport a load of smelly Boy Scouts any more?  Not this mom!  I'm ready for my mid-life crisis sports car...  Maybe a Mustang!

In all seriousness, I bought a 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager because I had previously owned 3 other Mini Vans and was very pleased with the car like ride and sound.  

This van was so much like my previous model that I did not have to learn any new knobs or switches.

Overall, it is a very nice vehicle.

However, I would have made a few changes had I been asked to design it.  

DISLIKES
1.  There is too much space between the glare guards and the rearview mirror.  The sun really shines through no matter how you adjust the guards.
2.  The windshield wipers never quite hit the surface hard enough to get all the garbage off of the windshield.  They need redesigned for a larger window.  Also, they stick out so far on the left that automated car washes cannot get under the wiper blades to clean the window well.
3.  The fact that it takes both hands to operate the cruise control is hard to get used to.  The older model had one button that would turn it on when pressed once and then accelerate when held down.  
4.  Just after 30,000 miles, the front brakes went out on mine.  I had to pay well over $300 to get them repaired.
5.  There is still a small blind spot on the drivers side.  Maybe it is just short people that have this problem:-)
6.  They should come standard with an extra console between the two front seats.
7.  Exhaust fumes from other cars needs to be filtered before getting in to car.  If I got stuck in traffic, I got sick unless I closed the vents.

Likes
1.  Two sliding doors.
2.  Amount of room for packages.
3.  Comfortable seats, making it a comfortable ride.
4.  Drives great in snow and ice because of the heavy front end.
5.  Great radio.
6.  Nice looking.
7.  Smooth ride, making it a great vacation mobile.<br><br>
