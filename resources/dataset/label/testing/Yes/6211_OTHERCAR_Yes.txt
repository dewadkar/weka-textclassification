            I have an LE, 4-cylinder model which I bought in 11/02 and it now has l0,000 miles on it.  I was inspired to look into the Camry when I rented one on a business trip and it was fine and comfortable and got an amazing 37 mpg in expressway driving.  Since I buy a new car only every l0 years or so, I have a lot riding on it when I do buy, but this car has met and exceeded my expectations.   The ride is very smooth; power is adequate with the 4-cylinder and I am happy to give up the vroom-vrooms for the great gas mileage I get (27 to 29 mpg in suburban driving and 35 on the highway).  I paid $l9,300 for the basic car (which is well-equipped) and got leather interior for that price.  We have taken it on one l,000 mile round trip and one l,700-mile round trip and it excelled on both, with a wonderful "spaceship" type ride that is very pampering.  I now get into other people's similar cars of other brands (such as a 2003 Altima) and think "boy, this ride is not so good and not so quiet".   I am one happy hombre.   You can get a better car than this, but you're gonna pay way more than this one costs.
