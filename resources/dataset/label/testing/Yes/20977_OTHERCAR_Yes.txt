            I am a Miataholic and I am powerless to change.  The purpose of this opinion is to alert prospective convertible shoppers about the dramatic changes for the 2001 Miata.  There is more power on tap, an optional 6 speed transmission, and an options package that includes NICE 16" wheels.

Owners of 2001 Miatas will benefit from the voiced concerns of over 500,000 Miata owners worldwide who have told Mazda what needed to be done to improve the Miata.  As unbelievable as it sounds, there were a couple of improvements needed.   More importantly, Mazda listened and delivered.

The 2001 Mazda Miata offers more torque at every rpm level.  This has been achieved with better timing and fuel management.  Mazda calls it "Variable Valve Timing."   What this means for us is 155 USEABLE horsepower on tap throughout the rpm range.  While most Miata enthuasiats would like even more power, this is a substantial increase, and you feel it everywhere.

I can pass on the six-speed.  Mazda introduced the 6-speed on the 1999 10th Anniversary edition.  The six-speed got mixed reviews. My advice is to try both the 5 speed and 6 speed and go with what feels best.   For heaven's sake, do not get an automatic!  Just say no!  Please say no.  The Miata is very forgiving for those of us who may be a little rusty  changing gears, or those with totally no experience.  Due to the Miata's light weight and precise easy to use shifter, your short learning time will  result in some tire chirps and perhaps some slight scrubb off of the tires.  My best friend learned to drive a stick in her 2000 Black Beauty Miata, license plate BATGRRL, and she's logged over 38,000 miles with no signs of a wearing clutch.  So be brave and get the 5 speed.

The sixteen inch wheels will be important to us motorhead types.  If you know what autocross means, and you know what B-Stock is, then you know having those 16" wider wheels will give you an advantage over any pesky rivals that try to win your trophy on any given day.  Trust me.  I had a chance to try both the 15" and 16" inch wheels at the National Miata event Autocross held in Daytona Beach, Florida last year.  Every bit of traction helps.

I have met my mission and I will close.  The current 2001 Miata offerings include an LS model which features the nice 16" wheels.  You also have to accept the tan leather interior, a price hike, and some extra weight on the LS model.  My choice would be a special order, or base model,  to include the 16" wheels and limited slip differential.  Include Air conditioning of course, unless you don't need it.  I would also go for all the extra body panels, forget the hardtop though, make it red or black or silver, go for the speaker upgrades - you will need the extra speakers when the cockpit gets breezy, and the top is down and the sun is out...sorry, I gotta go, my 1992 Yellow Miata, "Honey B", in the driveway beckons...

Drive safely.
