            I have recently started using my fathers 2000 Volvo S70 GLT. He bought it from the Inskip dealership in Warwick, Rhode Island for about $27,000. My dad does advertising work for Inskip so he was able to get a deal on this car that was leased previously for (1) year. 

The miles were low, no dents, squeaky clean, no paint chips, soft tan leather, and shiny forest green outside. He wanted a standard but was okay with it being an automatic since he got such a great deal on the barely used car.

Well, in the following opinion I will be anaylizing the handling, control, and overall stability of this car. This is the point of view of myself, and I don't drive this car every day.

<b>Handling</b>

I love the handling on nice luxury cars especially this Volvo S70. The reason I love the handling is because the steering isn't loose, it is tight. The tightness of the steering wheel is just right too, it is not difficult to make a turn  but it's not easy to swerve when having your hands loosly on the wheel. It gives you more control over the car and also makes it easier to make turns.

I find that a lot of American-made cars have looser steering. Then again I haven't driven every kind of American-made car and I am not a car tester but I think the Germans and Swedish do a pretty good job of making a wheel that allows you to take a turn as smooth and as consistent as you can. Therefore, tighter steering wheels and handling can improve your driving.

Taking turns in one swift, fluid motion is not hard to do with the Volvo S70. I enjoy the smoothness of a turn, whether it is a hairpin turn or a giant loop, when I am driving this car.

<b>Control</b>

I think overall this car has great control. First, though, the driver must have control over the vehicle and be aware then it is up to the car and it's performance to be in control.

Going over bumps or stray objects (potholes, puddles, sticks) is not such a great hazard with the Volvo S70. You must maintain an appropriate speed first but you do not have to worry about the car hitting a puddle then start swerving. You also don't have to get nervous abotu going over some bumps and losing control of the car's direction. I feel very safe when it comes to control in this car. The steering wheel also has a leather outside rather than plastic so that your hands don't slip off.

<b>Breaking</b>

Say good-bye to those "pump and stop" breaks...the Volvo S70 has a very reliable and safe breaking system. On a Ford Escort LX Wagon that I have drivem, you have to "pump" the breaks in order to come to a steady stop. On the Volvo, you have the control over the breaks and you are able to make a safe, steady, and complete stop without any problems. 

The breaks are not too light that it is difficult to make a nice stop like the Escort, but they are not so sensetive that every time you press the break pedal you start peeling your tires and "screeching". You are able to maintain a decent speed and you have enough time to come to a full, safe, and complete stop with the breaking system on the Volvo S70. 

I thuroughly enjoy riding in such a safe, quiet, reliable, and good car such as this. It has power everything and is generally comfortable.
