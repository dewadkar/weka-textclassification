            The Mecedes-Benz S-Class cars are one of the most luxurious cars I have ever been in. They offer luxury, comfort, speed, and a lot more other stuff that makes this a great car.

The seats are just perfect with optional heat if you feel a little bit on the arctic side. With a great sound system it just feels like your right in a concert. The engine is huge V-12 450 horsepower engine with the max speed 180 mph. Its as quiet as a sleeping baby. The ride was very smoothe when I got in one. I didn't even know if the engine was on.

The coolest thing about this car is their unique keys that slide out of the key ring. Its alarm system is one of the loudest. If you want this car first of all you need to have the money which is about 100k and second of all would be the car in general; all of its features will surprise you.<br><br>
