            This small compact sports car will take you for a ride.  It's sleek body, two door entrance and rear spoiler defines the shape of this car making it one of the better sports car.  It has CFC free air conditioning which is better for the environment.  If you get the GS or GS-R models it has, leather-trimmed interior, cruise control, power door lock, ABS, and a Power moonroof.  It comes with an AM/FM stereo with a in-dash CD player along with four speakers located throughout the car.  

What helps define a sports car it's it engine in which this car comes with a 1.8 litre, 16 valve engine, which is equivalent to 140hp.  If you get the GS-R it has a VTEC system making this engine much more powerful giving the car a 170hp.  Although this engine may not be as strong as other cars it's size to engine ratio gives it a great acceleration.  It's light weight helps the car race through the roads.

When my friend told me he purchased this car I wanted to go for a ride with him.  We went up and down the streets and along the highways.  To my amazement this car has a great pickup from 0-60 in probably under 8 seconds and it's traction was outstanding as we raced along the curbs of the road.  The sound system was also shocking but to my amazement he added a "box" so I'm not exactly sure how good the sound system was initially but he told me it was reasonable.

Overall, the performance of this car with it's sleek body and great looks, makes this car one of the better sports car out there.  Of course for it's price it's can't be compared to those much better sport cars such as a BMW roadster but it's just as good as the cheaper ones.
