            The Sony MVC FD-73 is an excellent camera. I don't have a lot of experience with digital cameras, but I did a lot of reviewing and comparison shopping before I bought mine. Most everything is automatic. It's a simple matter to take photo's and look at them on the 2.5&quot; LCD screen on the back of the camera. If you don't like what you see, just delete it. 

The pictures are stored on a standard 3.5&quot; floppy disk. And the LCD display on the back tells you how much battery time you have left in minutes. I like that feature. You can store up to 40 pictures on each disk if your camera is set to factory defaults. Then, it's a simple matter to pop the disk into your A: drive and look at your pictures using windows explorer or 'my computer' icon. 

You can select several different picture effects such as soft focus, sepia tones, negative, and solarize. It has a 10X zoom that works quite well. The auto macro feature lets you get to within 1 inch of your subject. You can choose from several different formats for your pictures too. I particularly like the e-mail setting. It's easy to send pictures to people using e-mail sized photo's. They are recorded at 320 x 240 resolution and saved in jpeg format for the smallest file size. Most of my pictures are about 10k using the e-mail size. That means fast e-mails. 

You can also set the flash intensity to; off, high or low. That enables you to save on battery life, which is just over 2 hours and 950 pictures worth. Not bad in my book. An AC charger is supplied with your camera, and it takes just over one hour to recharge the battery. I can't imagine ever wanting to take 950 pictures all at once. You can buy bigger and better batteries at a cost of around $50.00, but it doesn't seem necessary to me. Although, it would be nice to have a spare just in case. 

If you're not a professional photographer looking for a top of the line, best in it's class digital camera, you can't go wrong with this one.<br><br>
