            This is one of the nicest convertibles I have ever driven and ridden in.  Along with being extremely stylish and having a great engine, it is one of the roomiest convertibles there is.  Unlike other convertibles that have back seats only large enough for infants, the Sebring's back seat is large enough for adults to sit in comfortably, even for long trips.  This car handles extremely well, and it has only had to be taken in for routine maintenance(i.e. oil and fluid changes).  But just by taking a look at the picture, you can see that all your friends will want to take a ride, and with the back seat large enough for them, you will be able too.  So walk, run, drive, or jog to your chrysler dealership today!!!<br><br>
