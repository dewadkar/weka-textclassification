            I never thought I'd say this but I actually wanted to buy an Oldsmobile and until this car came out I never thought that I would want to. I can remember seeing this car on the road since 1998 and wondering &quot;who makes that car?&quot; When I finally found out I was in shock! Until this car came out I never really even paid attention to what Oldsmobile made.  There were some problems with the 1998 Intrigue from what I've heard such as the engine overheating but I think they fixed that problem. I never used to see them on the road. Now I see them all the time. The Intrigue was basically designed for younger buyers and they sure attracted my attention.  At first you really didn't see them on the road...now they are everywhere.

I wanted my parents to buy this vehicle not only for the styling but also because of the way it drives. (I'm happy to say they did buy it). It feels very stable on the road and almost all of the bumps you ride over you really dont feel. It has a very smooth, comfortable ride but you can still feel the road minus the annoyance of bumps.  The leg and seat room is more than adequate and the back seat is spacious to the point I could go to sleep in it. The seats are comfortable to sit in but they could be just a little softer.  The interior is well done and laid out and the exterior is sleek and stylish. They even have nice rims on the car which are alloy that you can also get in chrome. 

The pickup on the Intrigue is outstanding. It has a 3.5L V6 (compared to the 3800 series 195 HP engine which has been discontinued with the Intrigue) with its 215 horsepower and 230 pounds of torque gives it great pickup, especially on the highway. Its braking ability was very good and so was its handling. I remember when I put the accelerator right to the floor and well, let's just say that I was pushed back in my seat while being able to enjoy the roar of the engine.  

The gas mileage isn't that bad, about 19 city and 26 highway and it has a 17 gallon gas tank. I'm pretty sure that it has ABS disc brakes all the way around and traction control for better handling in bad weather. There are tons of options for this car, too many to go through but I will list a few.  An Autobahn package which has bigger tires and brakes, moonroof, spoiler, fog lights, climate control system for driver and passenger, an eight speaker sound system with an available CD changer and there's more but if you are really curious got to their web site.

The steering was a little too loose for me but I prefer tighter steering to begin with. The dash was a little too big for my tastes and the controls were somewhat complicated to figure out and their appearance was average. The appearance of the car under the hood leaves a lot to be desired with the looks of the engine but you don't have to look at it if you don't want to. 

I thought the price was more than fair($22,000 to about $27,000 or more roughly estimating)  and the option packages the car had made everything so convenient and made purchasing much easier. The car comes with a base model, the GX, a mid model, the GL, and the fully loaded GLS. Even if you don't want a GLS model you could go with the GL model and still get as many options as you want such as the moonroof or a spoiler. They're not like Volvo or Honda where you have to get a top of the line model just to get a moon roof or fog lights and spend extra money on all these packages you may not need. 

The Intrigue is also a little bit bigger than the Accord and has more horsepower than the Accord V6 which has 200 HP. The color selection is also pretty nice (about eight or so colors). I thought all the colors were very nice except for the gold and the bronze.  For the year 2000 the Intrigue came in another new color.  It's a beautiful color and if I ever buy an Intrigue it will be this color.  It is a dark metallic blue and in one light it looks dark metallic purple but in another light it will look blue.  

I wanted my parents to choose this car over the Accord because of the flexibility of what goes on the car and what doesnt. And almost everywhere I looked i saw very good reviews on it. The problems that I read about were few and i thought they were getting value for their money. When I had done my research on the web most of the sites I went to had high opinions of this car and magazine articles for the most part supported this car. For long test drives there were minor problems such as the door sticking. If you would like to build your own Intrigue you can go to their website: www.oldsmobile.com. 

I'm sure in the future the Intrigue is going to be my next car.  When I drive this car I feel sure of myself and very safe in it.  It's a beautiful car to me and I can't wait to buy one for myself (now if my parents would let me drive it all the time then I wouldn't have to but...)It's simply a joy to drive, it's no Mustang but it is still a very fun car.

If you think this car is too big for you then check out the Alero. I don't think it's as nice looking as the Intrigue but it's a good car. I test drove it myself. It's a little bit smaller, has less horsepower but it is still worth checking out. The Alero looks a little sportier.

(it figures guys...i'm stuck with a Mustang and my parents both have nice new cars!)
