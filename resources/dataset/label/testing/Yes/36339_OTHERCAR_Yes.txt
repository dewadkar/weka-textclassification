            I have had my GMC Sierra for 7 months and feel very satisfied with my purchase.  I have the 4800 engine with the SLE package.  I, formally a Ford F-150 buyer, am very impressed with the comfort that GM has incorporated into it's Sierra.  It handles like a big truck when turning (If you want better turning, GMC now offers the truck with quadrasteer).  The truck is smooth as silk on the highway and handles around town bumps fairly well.  I use my truck to pull a trailer and an 18 ft. bass boat.  It has plenty of power to pull smaller loads without sacrificing power of gas mileage on the road.  Maximum towing is smaller when compared to others in its class (a little over 6,000 lbs. compared to Toyota's 9,000lbs).  Gas mileage is right on with the sticker....15 in town and around 16 or 17 on the road. I have gotten better and worse depending on the driving conditions.

The style of the 2003 has changes slightly with the grill different and the body missing some add molding and features.  The SLE package could be better equipped with bed caps and fender trip to help sport up the look.  Also, my package did not come with a towing package (ask your dealer to install one for free before you purchase).  The interior is basic, yet has very comfortable cloth seats.  The radio has good sound for a stock system.  The interior is large and roomy with plenty of shoulder, leg and head room.  The extended cab is reasonably comfortable for passengers such as children and smaller adults.

Overall, this truck handles well and provides enough power and comfort for most truck owners.  For those using their truck for "work" purposes, the Heavy Duty model may be a better choice.
