            <b>I Love What It Did For Me...Toyota!</b>

Whoever said that the only things you can depend on are death and taxes obviously never had the pleasure of driving a Toyota Corolla. While it may seem boxy and outdated, the craftsmanship inside is a work of art. The car is not made for aesthetics but for dependability, and in this arena it shines. My Corolla has been in the family 12 years; my mother had it for 4 years, it was passed down to me for 5, and now my younger sister is happily driving it.


<b>The Specs</b>

The number one reason to love this car? It's incredible gas mileage! According to my calculations the 1988 Corolla gets well over 30 miles per gallon, and I've found that it's fuel efficiency hasn't decreased over the past 10 years.  In these days of skyrocketing fuel prices, knowing that your car won't suck your wallet dry is a nice feeling...

Gas isn't the only factor, the car's quality excells on many levels. Another striking success is the Corolla's brake system. I am horrible on all of my cars' brakes, known to even ride them until they smoke, but even I couldn't make the Corolla keep from stopping on a dime.

A big factor in my day-to-day enjoyment of a car is the design of the dashboard.  I drive fast and change radio  stations quickly, so I need knobs and buttons that well organized or I'll soon find myself wrapped around a telephone pole.  The Corolla's controls are geared towards the driver's side, making it easy to pump up the air or change cassettes while steering.  Oh, and the perfectly grooved steering wheel eliminates the chances of dangerous &quot;wheel slide&quot;.

I would also like to mention the quiet nature of this vehicle, surprising in a car this small.  Driving in silence is a big thing for me, and the Corolla gave me peace of mind every time I drove...

And what about price?  Corolla is one of the most reasonably priced vehicles on the market today, providing a lot of dependability for a very small price.  It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of an Eddie Bauer Limited Edition vehicle, but it is in a price range that almost anyone can manage without flinching.

Put all these factors together, and you have an oldie but goodie that it is a joy to drive and to own.

<b>A Defense of Small Cars</b>

&quot;But what about the size,&quot; you might demand, wondering how your intrepid author will explain away the Corolla's smallness.  Let me let you in a little secret I learned in Europe; <i>small is big enough</i>.  Small cars mean better handling, better fuel efficiency and easy parking.  While the Corolla isn't made to seat basketball players, I honestly believe its size-induced features outweigh the conservative legroom.  

<b>An Attack on Small Cars</b>

Like a snake that begins to devour its own tail, I must double back and admit to occasional frustration with the small size of Corolla.  When does it annoy me?  In social situations, when I have more than two people in the car and the lack of backseat legspace goes from inconsequential to embarrassing.  The point?  This isn't a family car, so if you like to pack them in you should avoid it...


<b>The Final Verdict</b>

 After 12 years of hard driving by my mother and I, the maintenance on the vehicle has been surprisingly little.  Occasional rattles and pings have popped up along the years, but a trip to the mechanics quickly fixed them. The vehicle has paid for itself many times over, and it still shows no signs of giving up.<br><br>
