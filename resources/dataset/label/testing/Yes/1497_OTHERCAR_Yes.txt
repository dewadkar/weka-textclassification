            I bought a new Saturn SL2 in 1996 for a lot of around-town driving and occasional camping, skiing, and Disneyland trips. I like this car because I worry about it less than any other car I've owned (including a new Acura Integra).

Why don't I worry? 
1. The car accelerates really well. It has a power option that you can turn on if you want to accelerate even more quickly, but I find that I can usually get up to speed on California freeway onramps quickly without the power option. Those damn Audi A4s haven't caught up to me yet!
2. The car hasn't needed any serious maintenance yet. (It only has 36,000 miles on it, so maybe this is no big deal. I was surprised at how soon I had to replace tires, though. See &quot;Complaints&quot; below.)
3. The car has a more solid feel than other cars in its price class (the Honda Civic Ex and Toyota Corolla LE). Its competitors tend to shake, rattle, and roll at about 70 MPH, but the Saturn feels solid up to 75 or 80 MPH. (Not that I DRIVE that fast.... Does the CHP monitor this web site???)
4. With the plastic polymer sides, you don't get dings. You do, however, get paint scratches and smudges. (Tip: When loading heavy suitcases in the trunk, don't drag them over the painted bumper. Sigh.)
5. The service experience has been pretty good. After I first bought the car, I thought the steering felt a little weird, so their chief mechanic took a long test drive with me and explained that that's how the steering feels in a Saturn because of the way its wheels are designed. It put me at ease. The great thing is that the service is CHEAP compared to Toyota, Acura, and Volkswagen service. The service people are very friendly, and I trust them.
6. The initial sales experience was pretty pleasant. Sure, the price they offer is very middle of the road. I could have negotiated a price about $700 lower for cars considered equivalent (the higher-end versions of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla). But I wanted a Saturn, and the price wasn't unreasonable for the horsepower (140), the power package, the air conditioning, etc. And there is a secret way of negotiating: you can ask them to throw in some option like a CD player without your paying for it. I didn't know this at the time, but I got a pleasant surprise. The salesman, concerned that I might be unhappy about my long wait in the finance line, gave me a car with a cassette deck and showed me I hadn't paid for it. I've since learned that you can &quot;negotiate&quot; for those things.
7. The trunk's pretty big, and the fold-down seats are a lifesaver. I don't need a SUV to shop for plants and trees or to haul things around.

COMPLAINTS
1. The tires wore out too quickly (at 28K miles), maybe because they're low-profile. The dealership says it's because I'm not keeping my tires inflated, but I'm always reinflating the front tires.
2. The interior is comfy, but cheap/plasticky. But what do you expect for $17,000?
3. Due to the tire's closeness to the car's exterior, you can't use standard tire chains for snow-driving; you have to buy special wheel attachments at a Saturn dealer, and they cost almost $300 the last time I checked.<br><br>
