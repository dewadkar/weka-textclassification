            	I bought this car which had previously been a Hertzmobile.It had manifestly been very well maintained.
	I operate it always with synthetic oil and teflon additive, using Bosch 4-point platinum spark plugs.  The car's performance is flawless. It has excellent roadability. It has logged over a hundred thousand miles and bystanders ask me where I got the "New" car.
	My wife likes the comfort of the car and often remarks about her pleasure riding in it.  My wife, being an invalid, cannot drive and so is always a passenger.
	We have no hesitation in driving this car anywhere. We find Pontiac dealer service widely available, even in small towns.  The trunk holds my wife's wheel chair and a lot of luggage besides for both of us.
