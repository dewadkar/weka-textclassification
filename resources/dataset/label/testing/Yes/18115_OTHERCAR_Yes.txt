            I decided one day to upgrade from the Mercury Tracer I was driving everyday to work, to the Mystique.  And I have not regretted that choice ever since.  
When driving the 200+ miles a day, from home to work, and client to client, I must have a dependable car. The Mystique has not given me a day of downtime.  It has always started on the first turn.  Granted, I have followed the book as far as oil changes, engine checks, and tire rotation/replacements are concerned; but if anyone wants performance from their vehicle, it must be treated as well.
I have enjoyed its sound system package, and the well-insulated interior. It also has a good center of gravity, and handles very well in wet and icy conditions.
