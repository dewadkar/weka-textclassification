            If you are looking for a sport utility vehicle the Chevy Blazer is a great pick.  The Blazer is a perfect family vehicle.  It has space for almost everything, handles in bad weather conditions, and is moderately priced.  
My family and I went on a trip to Wyoming.  There were 3 adults, a baby and a ferret.  We had no problem getting everything loaded into the blazer.  Our luggage had a weeks worth of clothes and supplies times three people.  Also you know when traveling with an infant you have to have everything from the bouncer to the swing.  Also we were transporting a ferret for a relatives which consisted of a cage.  Another wonderful feature you do not have with most cars everything was easily accessible. This is great when you have to quench your thirst and the next gas station is 30 minutes away.
I also own a mid size car and last winter when there was a snow storm my mid size car would not move from the drive way for about a week until the snow melted down but my chevy blazer was out on the road no problem.  I was even using my blazer to get other cars and trucks out of the ditches.  We even pulled a full load semi truck from a ditch with a tow rope and the chevy blazer.  I can honestly say I feel much safer in my blazer then in my mid size car.  
The blazer is in the middle of prices with sports utility vehicles.  the high end being the lexus and the low end being the suzuki.  You get a lot of sport utility vehicle for the money.  Also offers a lot of options.  You can customize it to fit your needs
