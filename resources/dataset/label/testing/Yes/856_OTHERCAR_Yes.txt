      I'm the resident technician in the family, so whenever anyone in my wife's family or my own gets a new electronic gadget of some type, I'm the one who end up supporting it.  

     I've owned an Olympus C-2000 camera, the forebear of this camera, for two years and been very happy with it.  When my father-in-law decided that he wanted to enter the world of photography, I told him what to look for and sent him on his way.  

     He found the Olympus C-3000 at BJ's.  The other camera he was looking at was a Nikon Coolpix (not sure of the model number, but it was a 2.1 megapixel camera.)  Since this camera was a 3.34 megapixel camera for approximately the same money, he reasoned that it was better.  And he was right. 

     The Olympus C-3000 shares a lot with its predecessor.  It has added a few more buttons on the back (which led to some problems when he called, trying to find out how to delete a picture), but the basic body shape is the same.  I believe it shares the same lens.  

     How to do basic things are still the same -- taking pictures, zooming, deleting pictures.  The C-3000 offers the ability to take brief QuickTime movies.  It also can record sound in these movies.  This feature is one of the two that make me jealous.  

     Olympus digital cameras tend to be easy to pick up and use -- they look and act a lot like film point-and-shoot cameras.  Pretty much anyone who has used a camera will be able to pick up point-and-shoot style photography without needing a degree in advanced engineering.  Also, it's comforting to the new user to have a camera that actually looks like a camera rather than some gadget from Star Trek.  

      The C-3000, like others in its line, has a 1.8 inch LCD viewfinder on the back.  This is handy for reviewing pictures and framing them.  The optical viewfinder will help save on battery life, but does not match up equally to the picture.  

      The other feature that the C-3000 has that the C-2000 does not is a USB connection.  I hated the C-2000's slow download time so much I went out and bought a SmartMedia reader to get around it.  Downloads are very quick, and the included software (Olympus Camedia Master 2.0) makes it easy.  About the only thing I would have liked to see in the software would be the ability to create a new folder to download to (as it is, you have to create the folder in Windows Explorer or My Computer, then start the download.) It can be connected with a serial connection, but why anyone in their right mind would want to do this is beyond me -- the serial connection is S-L-O-W.   

      The remote control from the C-2000 has been retained, and it's a useful feature if you want to get in the picture yourself, although you have to set the camera to 'Remote Mode On' in order to use it.  This isn't terribly difficult to do, but it would've been nice if the user could just press the button and go.  There is also a self timer for those who prefer that.  

       The C-3000 also offers more control for more advanced photographers.  It can operate in aperture-priority mode or shutter-priority mode.  Most point-and-shooters will never use this, but the option is nice.  

       The digital images produced by the camera are extremely high quality, which is usual for Olympus.  It can produce images up to 2048x1536 in size.  The autofocus copes extremely well so that pictures are well focused and the colors are vibrant and realistic.  Mated with my father-in-law's HP 930C printer, the C-3000 produces excellent quality photo prints.  (Perhaps not exactly, 100% photo quality, but it's hard to tell the difference.) 

       For the average point-and-shooter, the C-3000 is probably the best value out there.  It's around $450-500, and the features of this camera compare favorably with its competitors.  Picking up basic point-and-shoot skills is very easy, and when you want more advanced features, they're there.  I would recommend getting rechargeable batteries (it takes 4 AA's) and a larger SmartMedia card than the 8MB card supplied with the camera.  But all in all, another winner from Olympus.
