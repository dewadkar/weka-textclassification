            Ever heard of the Q-boat? The legendary warship that looks like an ordinary fishing boat to the untrained eye? When I finally figured out this camera, it reminded me of nothing else.

I have been into 35mm SLRs for a while now, and was thinking of stepping into the digital world. Went over to B&H with the Nikon Coolpix and the Canon Elph II in mind - sleek, cool, and digital. The salesperson showed this as a contender in the same zone - but then I was decided on the Nikon, and brought it home. This was a very cool camera. However, the Camedia stuck to the back of my mind. A week later, I was back at B&H, exchanging the Nikon for this totally awesome Camedia, and some extra memory. I haven't had a chance to regret my decision yet.

So what makes this camera stand - in my opinion - way out of the rest in the entry-level digital world? Here's what I think of the features:

****************************
T*H*E ** G*O*O*D
****************************

<b>1. Resolutions:</b> from whopping 8MB 1600x1200 TIFFs (uncompressed) to compressed 97kB 640x480 images. As far as I know, this is the only camera in this pricerange that offers you the uncompressed, super high resolution TIFF as a saving option.

<b>2. SLR capability:</b> This is why I totally love this camera. As I mentioned, I like SLRs. The extra bit of controlling the image that makes all the differences. If you are the average SLR user, I'm sure you'll agree with me - I rarely use the manual focus mode, but nearly always adjust the aperture/ exposure timing. This is the only camera in this price range that offers you all that - shutter/ aperture priority modes, fully manual mode, as well as a bunch of programmed exposure modes and special effects modes (sepia/ black and white/ blackboard/ whiteboard). I don't think too much of the special effects - you can always do a good job with them on Photoshop - but I think the aperture/ shutter priority modes, and the manual mode as a last resort in difficult lighting conditions, are absolute necessities for the amateur enthusiast. This even has exposure compensation modes and auto-bracketing.

<b>3. Sensitivity:</b> Did I mention already how this camera is way better than the others around? Here's another reason. The Nikon and the Canon I tried had single sensitivity - fixed at 100 ASA. The Nikon had a way to boost it to 150 ASA, and that was that. This beauty allows me to select one of 100/ 200/ 400/ 800 ASA - slow speeds for sunsets and tender lighting, fast speeds for taking pictures indoors without killing the depth with the flash burst. Makes you feel real good about it. No mid-roll rewind to take out the daylight roll and put in the faster night rolls. No wasted film.

<b>4. Lens:</b> in 35mm equivalent (the only way that makes sense to me), the lens is 38 - 380mm. In digital terms, it's 10x optical. That does away with my wide, normal, and tele lenses all in one go. The lens comes with a screw mount in the front, which can be used to put on adapters for wide angle shooting, but I have not tried this yet. The same mount can also be used for mounting filters - especially polarizers, for color photography.

<b>5. Display:</b> there's a tiny little viewfinder for situations requiring power conservation. At other (normal) times, you'll really appreciate the large LCD screen (1.5", 3.8cm) with brightness adjustment.

<b>6. Navigation</b> Scrolling through the menus could not have been easier. Of course, given so many options - resolution, shooting modes, file format, this and that, it takes a while to get to know the menu system and learn where to find which option - but once that's taken care of, you'll be flying through the screens. Selection is simple with a central menu button and cursor keys around it to scroll around. The screens are like tabbed widgets on Windows, and you'll soon get the hang of it all. Remember to set the default parameters right - that way, the camera switches on with your favorite settings (like resolution, file format, LCD display on/off, etc.)

<b>7. Built in flash:</b> handles Auto (low and backlight), Red-Eye reduction, Fill-In, Slow shutter synchronization. The slow sync mode is good to capture an evening party, with the party decor captured with a slow exposure, along with foreground subjects lit up with the flash burst.

<b>8. Video mode:</b> I don't really use this, but it's a nice-to-have feature. You can take 15 seconds of high quality, or 62 seconds of low quality video on this, along with audio.

<b>9. PC interface:</b> the easiest ever - USB. Haven't seen anything that's any more plug-and-play than this. Data transfer takes a while, specially if you are using big 128MB cards.

<b>10. Power source:</b> this runs on normal AA batteries, available practically everywhere that's inhabited by humans. One of the first accessories you'd want to buy are rechargeable batteries (NiMH are good) and a charger.

<b>1. Bulky:</b> nothing as bad as my Nikon N70 SLR, but then there are smaller, weaker models flooding the market. If size is the first concern for you, you should be looking at the Canon Elph, with it's autocratic hand on dictating your picture parameters and zero-override flexibility. Fortunately, this comes with a nice add-on case, and the size makes a nice fit in my hand - overall, a very balanced camera in both landscape/portrait shooting modes (horizontal/ vertical).

<b>2. Inadequate memory off-the-box:</b> to use this camera well, you <b> must</b> buy more memory than this comes with. I recommend at least 128MB - otherwise, you'll be stuck to a handful of high resolution shots, or a lot of low resolution shots.

<b>3. No charger in the box:</b> for the price, Olympus could very well have included a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger, or some alternative of that. It's a little irritating to buy these things as must-have accessories. The Nikon Coolpix is good in this zone.

There's hardly anything I can say against this camera, even after some 6 months of using it. If you are one of the skeptics and don't go by the opinions/ epinions of others, I would like to request you to give this camera a try, from someplace that can accept a return if you don't like it. Provided you have enough memory and rechargeable batteries, there's hardly anything you can come up with against this wonderful gadget. Of course, I'm assuming that you are comparing this to the other models in this price range, and not with the Nikon D1 or something similar. If you come up with a better product at a similar price, do let me know.

And yes - check the deals, at B&H and at the Olympus website, for money-back discounts on extra memory. When I bought this, I got my 128MB memory card for about $20, after mail-in rebates.
