            First of all, let me start by saying that the NSX is not for everyone.  In order for you to determine if the NSX is right for you, two questions need to be answered.  First, are you the type of driver that is always looking for a quicky?  In other words, do you have that redneck dragstipp blood running through your veins?  Second, is your wife also your sister?  Now, if you answered yes to any of these two questions, THIS CAR IS NOT FOR YOU!!!!!!!

In order to better understand the NSX, one must first realize that this car is best described in one word, "Finesse".  It was built for the race track and not the drag strip.  This is one, if not the primary reason why this relatively small 3.0 V6, is being put into competition with the big muscle cars like the vipers, vetts, etc.  And still,  It cannot be beat!  There is nothing that handles like the NSX.  You have the authentic formula 1 race car feel, and on the same token, luxury and comfort you would expect from a $60,000.00 car.  I have owned a corvette and the driven vipers and they just don't come close!  Let's start with the vetts.  I owned a 1995, purchased new, I paid $42,000.000 for mine.  Sure they're fast, but really though, at what cost?  A vette will probably run you now about $45,000.00. Here's the low down, in about 15K miles, the dash starts to make funny noises, you know, like something is coming loose inside.  You take it in and they say they'll look into it.  A full day later, you come and pick the car up and nothing has changed.  The dealer tries to explain to you that because of the engine having so much power, things are bond to seem a little "loose".  But then again, I seem to notice that this is the case with all chevy products.  The camaros and even their trucks suffer from this unexplained phenomena!  By the time you hit 50K, everything inside shakes and rattles.  You stop counting the different noises by now.  I guess you start to accept defeat.  Outside of the exhaust, which is about the only thing that sounds great on the car, it jingles and clunks with the mere touch of the accelerator!  Ok, it starts to get on your nerves, but is only taken away momentarily only when you notice just how flimsy and cheap all of the plastic nobs and buttons inside the car really are!  In addition, you notice that things are beginning to fade and wear out.  Again, you start to accept defeat.  By 60K-70K miles down the line, the invincible vette is no more that a bucket of junk!  I sold mine to a 19 year old kid for $18,000.00. A total lose for me!  As for the viper, well, let me start by saying that this is just a barstool on an engine.  I made the biggest goof and borrowed my buddies 1997 and decided to take a trip to Vegas from L.A.  Man, what a horrible mistake!  Rest assure I will never attempt this again.  I had to stop twice, not to site see, but just so I could regain the feeling in my legs!  Along with the next to no luxury factor, everything inside of this car is synthetic.  It is a true shame that for such a price tag, this vehicle looks like a dodge neon inside.  The wall to wall cheap plastic really got on my nerves.  Well, in reality, the lack of luxury won't seem to bother you at all, since the road noise will give you such an excruciating headache, that you won't find time to moan about anything else other that your physical health!

In short, this car is not for everyone, but for the refined few, this is the way to go.

P.S. I recommend an aftermarket exhaust and intake.
