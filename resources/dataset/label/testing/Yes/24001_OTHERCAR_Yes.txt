            I bought my '92 Honda Accord in 1992 from my parents, who bought it brand new from the dealer in the fall of '91.  Honda is certainly a dependable car to bank your money on.  Being now 8 years old, I have only had problems with the air conditioning system, fighting with Tallahassee humidity and mold spores galore.  A little dye, a few repairs, and it works well now for hot Florida weather.  Besides that, I have replaced a suspension boot and a fuel injection relay.  It has never let me down yet, and I would definetly buy another Japanese car.

     My dad worked as an engineer for the biggest catalytic converter supply place in the world.  He knows cars, and he also recommends Japanese cars over American any day.  You cannot go wrong with a Honda or Toyota.  If you are looking to spend between $10,000 and $25,000, I would definetly choose Japanese.
