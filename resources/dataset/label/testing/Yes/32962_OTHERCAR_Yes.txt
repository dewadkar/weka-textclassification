             I really love driving.  As long as the car runs and there is gas in the tank, I am good to hit the road.  However, the 1997 Toyota Camry is by far the finest car I have driven.  It is my mom�s car but I have driven it many times.

	The first feature I like about the car is its appearance.  It looks like a very classy car and it is definitely a ride that anyone can feel cool driving in.  I have been seeing the Camry in being driven by many stars in some new music videos.

	The second feature is an excellent stereo system.  One part of the stereo system that is great is the antenna is built into the rear window.  The radio comes in crystal clear.  The Camry has an excellent speaker system.  It has speakers in the trunk and on the side of glove compartment.  Overall the system is excellent.

	Another great feature is the Camry�s adjustable seats.  I love the fact that I can adjust not only the distance but also the height of the seat.  Remember when you were in Driver�s Ed and you had to use a telephone book?  Don�t worry those days are over thanks to the seat adjustment system in the Camry.

	All right, you probably want to know what is under the hood.  Our car has the 4 cylinder LE and it is very powerful.  Passing on the highway is no problem with this car.  In fact it is so powerful that I will have my foot resting on the gas and be going 50 mph.  You really have to make an effort to watch your speed because this is such a powerful car.  Since it is a 4 cylinder it gets better gas mileage than the 6 cylinder.

	The Camry�s gas mileage is an interesting situation.  The gas mileage for driving around town is not very good. However, I drove from New York to New Hampshire and back on one tank of gas.  This car is unbeatable when driving cross-country.

	The Camry has a very safe record in test crashes and it comes equipped with ABS brakes and airbags.  The lights are very bright and are helpful in nighttime driving.  The Camry also comes with power windows, power steering.  Built within the gas cap is a gas cap holder so you do not have to lose your gas cap or leave it on the roof of your car to eat away at the paint.

The last great feature of the car is its dependability.  With regular maintenance, this car has been a solid performer.  We have had no mechanical problems.

	What don�t I like about the Camry?  Well, it is the most stolen car in America so you have to make sure you lock the doors.

	The only other problem I have with the Camry is zero visibility as to where the tip of front of the car.  It is impossible to see over the hood so parking can present a problem sometimes.  I have bumped my fair share of curbs due to the design of this car.

	All in all, this is an excellent car.  Toyota is an established car company that is producing quality automobiles like the Toyota Camry.
