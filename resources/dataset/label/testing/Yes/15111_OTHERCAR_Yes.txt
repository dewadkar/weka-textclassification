            I just purchased the 1999 Altima and I love it! This is a great family car with 4 doors and lots of leg room, both front and back.  The seats are comfortable in the rear.  I am very happy with the way this car handles,it has a nice smooth ride.  The sound system in this car is another plus,  I have a CD player and the with the speaker surround you can really enjoy the music during your drive.

I definetely would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a new car. <br><br>
