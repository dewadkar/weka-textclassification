            I really do believe this is the best car ever, for several reasons.
First of all, it looks beautiful.  It is almost exactly the same as the Audi A4, and the price tag is much nicer.  I bought the base model, but I am not regretting it.  The base model comes almost loaded, because you get so much: 8 speaker am/fm cassette stereo, two front air bags, two side air bags (they come out of the seat to protect you no matter what position you are in) anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, power locks (but power windows aren't standard) a folding key with remote, and heated side mirrors.  Not bad for only $17,200, eh?

One of the most endearing features of the new Jetta is the lighted dashboard.  All the indicators (speedometer, etc) glow with a beautiful blue, and actions (your actual speed, etc) glow red.  I have had people stop me at stop lights to tell me how &quot;cool&quot; my dashboard looked.  All of your mileage is digital, and easy to read.  

The lights are very bright on this car.  The headlights, hi-beams and hallogen lamps are all housed in one area, and are extremely well focused in a broad rectangle ahead of you.  The light is focused so you see more from side to side, and less up and down.  Sounds like a hindrance, but believe me it's not.  The light shine up to the top of a tractor-trailer, but not too much higher.  Because the lights are so focused everything in much better illuminated than with standard headlights where the light is allowed to bounce all over the place.

The stereo in the car is very good, and I chose to have the optional 6-cd changer installed.  The controls are easy to see and read, and the radio, tape and cds are all controlled from one panel.  Just above the stereo are the controls for the heat and a/c.  Also, there are two cup holders in the front and back.  At first I thought they were flimsey, but they have held many a large Chai with no problem.  They are designed to ratchet onto your cup, so there is no chance of spillage.  The only problem is they don't hold 32 ounce cups, like large soda cups, but I guess that's what friends are for.

The both visors have large, lighted vanity mirrors (thank you!) and a strap to hold onto maps.  There are large cargo areas in the doors, and a small glove compartment.  Older Jettas didn't have glove compartments at all, to save room for the air bag.  Now they have glove compartments, which have a shelf, which is supposedly where you are supposed to put your manual (but oddly enough, it doesn't fit on the shelf).  Where Volkswagen skimped on space up front, they more than make up for in back.  The trunk is <b>huge</b>.  My friend's gest that you could fit several dead bodies back there.  I bet you could, but I am not planning on finding out.  There is also a full sized spare under the trunk, and the tire iron/jack combo.

The only things I do not like about this nearly perfect car are 1. the small glove compartment (but, the added safety is well worth the small glove compartment, and the areas in the door and the huge trunk make up for it), the rear seats are very hard to fold down (it's almost not worth folding them down, for any reason, because they are so much of a pain), and the fact that the gas tank is on the opposite side than most cars (which is just inconvenient, and I am sure that the hoses rubbing on my car as I fill is not a good thing).

Other than those three minor things, I have absolutely no complaints about the car, and I think that the Jetta is the best car on the market today!<br><br>
