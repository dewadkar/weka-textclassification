               I have been a very satisfied owner of a Sony MVC-FD71 camera for a little over two years now, and can attest to the fact that it is a very solid little camera.  I do construction work building roads and I carry the camera in my company pickup to keep a photographic record of anything that happens of importance.  This camera endures temperatures ranging from well below freezing to over 120 degrees inside the pickup with windows rolled up in the middle of a Kansas summer and has not quit yet.  

    I bought this camera for because of the ease of getting pictures from the camera to the computer with the 3.5&quot; floppy disc, and for the fact that the discs are cheap making it economical to have discs for different jobs keeping photos separate. It takes good quality photos, and you can adjust the photo quality to fit your needs as far as photo quality and number of pictures on a disc, from around 16 on high quality, to around 23 on normal quality.  The battery has a good run time to it, around 2 hours and quickly recharges for the next go.

    My dislikes are few and petty, the main on being the screen on the back is also the viewfinder.  On bright sunny days, it is sometimes difficult to see the images on the screen in direct sunlight. Other than that, I have and will strongly recommend this camera to anyone.<br><br>
