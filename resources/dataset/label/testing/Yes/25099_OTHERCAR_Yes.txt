            I moved from a two-seat sport car to the TrailBlazer and after surviving the initial culture shock and gasoline bills shock I don't regret the move. The TrailBlazer handles well at all speeds. It's comfortable, and driving 600 miles without a relief driver didn't leave me exhausted the one time I did it. I would not have ordered four-wheel drive, but that's what was on the vehicle. In February when the roads were almost constantly snow-covered I was glad to have the four-wheel capability. After 10 months of service there's still no hint of squeaks or rattles--quite a contrast to previous GM vehicles. The LTZ model is packed with convenience features and gadgets, and the Bose sound system is great.
