            We opted for the Sienna after checking out virtually every minivan on the market - except the Odyssey.  Perhaps we would have gone for the Odyssey had ANY Honda dealer had one to test drive!  (one has to wonder if Honda will start cutting corners in a vehicle that is selling TOO good...)

The first thing to notice about the Sienna is that it rides and drives like a fine sedan.  The ride is comfortable, wonderfully quiet and effortless -- even through the back hills of our New England hometown.  The transmission is strangely smooth -- switching from lower to higher gears virtually without pause.  Acceleration is quick and responsive.  This is starkly contrary to the Windstar (yuck!); Grand Caravan or Town & Country (again -- I never had an opportunity to test drive the Odyssey).  The V6-210hp is more than adequate -- and with a tow package (inexpensive option), the extra fan keeps the engine cool as a cucumber.

The dual zone climate control is standard these days on most vans.  However, we're impressed with the strength of the heat system (40 degrees to a balmy 95 degrees in 3 minutes!) and efficiency in both the front and back of the cargo area.  No clunky on/off that we had in our previous Mercury Sable.

Cosmetically, we love the tasteful elegance of the Sienna.  No cheapo faux-wood here.  The Symphony edition (in gray) uses a pleasant gray weave upholstery that's soft to the touch and site.  The dash board is a little too simple -- a little more technology would be a welcome plus.  Yet, everything is easily seen - and the blueish-background non-reflective-readouts are a nice touch.

Spring for the Symphony package with the 6-way power driver seat, upgraded JBL stereo (excellent!), leather wrapped steering wheel (it actually makes a difference) and other minor perks.  Added together, it's worth the approx. $950 (invoice price).  We have only one power door (dual doors only available on XLE -- why?) -- but, it's very sensitive to arms caught in the way -- an important feature with a curious 3 year old.

In the first week of ownership - we had a close encounter with a deer who jumped in front of the van.  The brakes responded perfectly -- and the added skid control ($440) seemed to keep us from fishtailing.  I'm glad to say that the deer and Sienna remained unscathed.  Almost cost us a few bucks... or, at least some dough (read: doe)... (groan).

Other plusses: daytime running lights (but, I can't figure out how to shut them off at night when - say - sitting in someone's driveway); steering wheel radio controls (but, sometimes I hit the buttons accidentally); stored power for windows; pleasant "beep" when locking/unlocking doors; folding AND sliding seats in ALL rows (eat THAT Mr. Grand Caravan!); no center console (good be a negative for some).

Now the down side:  the liftgate is very (I do mean very) heavy and difficult to slam shut.  We almost purchased a T & C with power liftgate -- I am regretting not having that one option.  My wife learned that the clothing hook is not strategically located (clothing blocks the view -- but, what else can be done?).  The rear washer sprays a straight line - like a missile - at one spot on the window.  So 1/8 gets sparkling clean -- the other 7/8 just has smeared and smudged dirt.  The front washer is a bit better -- but, a spread spectrum of cleaner would be more thoughtful; the CD holder is way out of the way -- and poorly designed); ashtray is NOT an option - it's standard (boo!).  Careful - van has some nasty blind spots -- drive carefully the first few times on the road.

All in all - we are VERY pleased with the Sienna.  It oozes quality all over.  The list of negatives hardly matter -- and are really just nit-picky things for which to watch out.  Enjoy!
