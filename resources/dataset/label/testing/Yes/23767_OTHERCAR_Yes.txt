            If you can find a late model Saturn such as my 92, you may be in for a long-term reliable car depending on the mileage.  Mine is approaching 160,000 miles and I haven't put any money into it for the last 40,000.  The interior is staring to wear and the clutch is starting to slip, but except for minor upgrades (brake pads, alternator, tires), I have not spent very much at all for maintenance.  

The exterior shows no rust (most of it is not metal anyway) and is in good shape.  I just had it in a shop and they told me if I did not replace the original struts and shocks then I would only get another 50,000 out of the car.  

I do not know if I am just lucky with this vehicle, but this auto has almost been free to drive considering the mileage and the fact that it has been paid off for 6 years.  

My Saturn is a no frills car, but it is a solid, reliable means of transportation that I have been really happy with.      <br><br>
