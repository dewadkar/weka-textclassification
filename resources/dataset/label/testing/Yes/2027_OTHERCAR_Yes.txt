            The 1998 well-equipped Grand Marquis is restyled to look smoother. It has more horsepower and improved handling, braking, directional stability and steering feel. The quick steering is precise and handling is surprisingly good with the optional handling package. But the Grand Marquis is no BMW. Even with that package, its ride is a bit floaty and it has pronounced body sway and tire squeal when pushed too hard through curves. There's still room left for a car such as the Grand Marquis. Although billed as a six-passenger car, the Grand Marquis only seats four 6 footers comfortably. The center of the front and rear seats are uncomfortable and best suited to kids and short trips. Most of the huge trunk's capacity is in an awkward to reach deep well in the center of the floor.This Mercury, which has shared its chassis with the Lincoln Town Car for years, comes as the $21,890 GS and higher line $23,790 LS, which features upgraded upholstery and remote keyless entry. After all, even BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz sell large sedans with V-8s and rear-wheel drive.
