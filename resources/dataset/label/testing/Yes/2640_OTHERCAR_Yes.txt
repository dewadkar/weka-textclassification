            I am a 19 year old male...and I am on my second 3000GT.  I love this car so much that I just had to upgrade.  I had a 93 SL earlier this year that I got about two years ago and I loved it...but I needed more power, since I like driving fast.  So, in February, I bought a 97 3000GT Vr4...which was the best investment that I have made so far.  I got it with 48,000 miles on it and it was in mint condition...and still is.  I paid 27k for it after taxes and registration...all said and done.  Today, it has 60k on it and it has never had a problem.  Stock, they have 320hp - 222hp for the engine and another 98hp approx at peak boost with the turbos.  As of right now, I am pushing about 450hp to the ground, and I still haven't had any problems.  I race this car on the drag strip and have had to do nothing but oil changes and regular maintenance to keep it in tip top shape.  The ONLY defects, as small as they may be, in this car that I have found are that the passenger side head light doesn't have proper ventilation, so it tends to have condensation on the inside.  Also, the first investment, if you buy or own this car, would be to spend a little money on an oil cap...the one that comes with the car (plastic) is bad and tends to spray oil all over your engine and the exhaust manifold heat plate...causing your engine to smoke (oil on exhaust manifold). Other than that, the car is a great investment.  8 months later and 12,000 miles later...according to kelly blue book, my car is still worth $27,257.00 which is more than what I paid for it in february with 12,000 miles less on the car.  That's amazing.  Who should buy this car you ask?  Anyone looking for a fun car to drive...and anyone who likes a fast car.  Okay, for those of you out there who are porsche lovers or ferrari lovers... how does it make you feel to know that this car is faster than a Carrera or a 355 berlinnetta from 0-100mph?  Well, it is... so go test drive one and see for yourself.  These cars are very rare and hard to find...so if you find one, snatch it up....  If you have any questions, let me know...

Tips:  Don't let anyone working on these cars put your tires on with an
       impact wrench...they will worp your rotors very quickly
       (very expensive to fix - $400 or so)<br><br>
