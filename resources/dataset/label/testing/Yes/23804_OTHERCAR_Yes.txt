            I am the Internet Sales Director and Fleet Manager with a verrrrrry huge Toyota dealer in Southern California. My commute is 48 miles each way daily, meaning I manage to drive about 110 miles a day (with errands!) 6 days a week.
I wanted a car with a solid feel, great gas mileage, and excellent visibility for the freeways I commute on here in SoCal...and I got it. And, in the bargain, I got a car with comfy seats, far BETTER MPG than I bargained for, large trunk, GREAT reliability, and very little road noise. It's zippy, fun to drive, has a lot of eye appeal to me (but, I did load it up with factory alloy wheels, rear spoiler, and the side sport flares and a 6-disc indash changer).
I get 42-45 MPG, and it was CHEAP! Cheap to insure, cheap to maintain, cheap to drive. 
It's peppy, and performs well. Yes, on a steep hill with the air conditioning on, it works to climb. At freeway speeds, on a great incline thru the Toll Road down here, I sometimes have to downshift to 4th at 60+ MPG to climb safely and maintain speed. But, what small, economy-minded  4cyl car wouldn't at any steep incline? 
I could, if I wanted, drive a Landcruiser... a Limited, a Solara...anything luxurious and elegant. I chose the Echo for my commute and I am very happy that I did.
