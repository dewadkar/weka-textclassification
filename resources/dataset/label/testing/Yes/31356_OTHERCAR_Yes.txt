            Deadly speed... that's the first thing that comes to mind when looking for a new car.  I was forced to do just that when I was rear ended not to long ago, losing my beloved 1995 Ford Mustang.  I decided that I had to have a change and I immediately went to look for new cars from any manufacturer that had a vehicle with a little bit of speed.


<b>DRIVING AND HANDLING</b>

This car is amazing out of the box, the handling is superb with extreme straights, with little control at all...  Coupled with cruise control on manual transmission, the vehicle has amazing control, even at 6-7,000 RPMS, where it hits it's peak 180 HP...  The only bad part about the vehicle is that because it is a front wheel drive, steering while speeding out of a stop is quite difficult and it is easy to lose control temporarily, but for straightaways, few cars can rivel the control that you gain from this vehicle... and weaving through traffic??? not a problem...


<b>SPEED</b>

180 HP is very deceiving... This vehicle has more pickup than the camaro and the Mustang, standard.  This is from personal race tests with friends...  The Celica, once in third gear blows away all other sportscars.  It's only main weakness is that in order to hit peak power, you must nearly redline, which is true for most vehicles anyway... Fortunately, third and fourth gear are so closely related, you are at peak power immediately out of peak in third, so you get an amazing boost immediately.

There is a downside to this power... there isn't any past about 70-80 mph... with a top speed of 160... it's very unfortunate that this 6 speed monster midget accelerates like a Ford Taurus at higher speeds...  The 6th gear is essentially pointless...


<b>LUXURIES</b>

Of Course to make everything that much better, the vehicle comes with leather interior, that is extremely sleek.  It is the type of leather that you don't stick to, which is a huge plus.  

The entire interior is trimmed with silver, which is just awesome to offset the black interior carbon fiber dash.

The vehicle comes with a great sound system, unless you are like me and enjoy the deepest bass that you can find... Treble is excellent on the factory speakers... but you'll definitely want a better cd player and some subwoofers if you intend on fully enjoying your listening experience.

The vehicle is equipped with a sunroof/moonroof/tilt, which looks excellent on the vehicle and totally eccentuates the car.  Everything is so smoothly placed within the vehicle, that it's manufactured to near perfection.


<b>UPGRADEABILITY</b>

The great thing about this vehicle is the ability to upgrade it.  Due to the nature of it being a foreign vehicle, it's generally seen as a major car for modifications and upgrades.  Because of this, it is extremely easy to find body kits, engine upgrades, exhaust upgrades, intake upgrades, and the like.  In my own personal searches, I've found a lot more kits and parts for the Celica than I ever found for my Mustang...


<b>OVERALL</b>

Overall, this is probably the best car in it's bracket for the price... with it's amazing 0-60 in 6.7 seconds, it's definitely a keeper for any auto enthusiast.  And if you're just looking for a sweet ride, regardless of speed, this is definitely a high luxury vehicle and with it's easy upgradeability, it's simple to add in more luxuries as needed.  

The car also gets 32 miles to the gallon highway, I'd like to see any other sportscar do that...  

The only major issue is that this is an extremely high theft vehicle, so a lojack system isn't just an option, it's a necessity.  It will also lower your insurance substantially, I saved about $50/month from that and another $15/month from my awesome security system that I had installed... but my sound system added an extra $40, so I'm pretty much just evening myself out...  :)
