            We purchased a 2000 Dodge Stratus (program/demo) vehicle with 18,000 miles and the remaining factory warranty. Two months ago we purchased a 2000 Dodge Neon for my husband. I needed a vehicle with more room. A backseat large enough to fit 2 grandbabies (one in a car seat), and a toddler. This car has it all. I like smooth and quiet ride. Steers easily. This car came fully loaded with auto everything and a CD player. The CD player in this car is in arms reach without looking down or up or away. I have seen some cars (not dodges) where the CD player was close to floor and that was a concern for me. There were many new color choices on the Stratus. Our families (particularly my father in law) only purchases Dodge products. He owns 3 Dodge mini vans. I cannot recall any of us ever having any major car repairs on our dodges. I absolutely love my new car and would highly recommend it to anyone. Dodge Lover Forever!!!<br><br>
