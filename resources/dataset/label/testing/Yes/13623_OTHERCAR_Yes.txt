            After driving an Audi A4, I decided that I wanted something with a little more pep.  I began to shop around and wanted to stay in the sport sedan class.  

I looked at the Lexus IS 300 and was impressed.  However, the IS lacked in speed and comfort (suede seats!) Also, having owned Japanese cars in the past, I knew that I would be losing lot of money on the depreciation scale.  

Next was the Mercedes Benz C280.  Car is full of luxury and comfort but lacked in performance.  In addition, MB was coming out with a newer model.  

My next choice was the BMW E46 3 series.  It was love at first sight.  The car was screaming "performance" with yet a subtle hint of luxury and class.  For everyday driving it was comfortable and reliable.  Gas mileage was not too bad with 22 in the city and 29 on the highway.  The radio controls on the steering wheel allowed me to keep my eyes on the road and not on the radio.  I first noticed the performance capability when going around a bend on the highway.  I was side by side with a Toyota Camry when we hit the bend doing about 60.  The Camry slowed down while I maintained speed without feeling any loss of grip on the road.  I felt even less Gs than I when was driving the Audi.  The car also has good "pulling power" when needing to pass other cars.  0-60mph times are in the lower 6 seconds range.  

Service was great but I do admit it was because the car was under warranty.  Labor rates have reached up to $100/hr in some dealerships.
