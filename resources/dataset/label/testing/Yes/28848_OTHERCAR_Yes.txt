            I have had this camera for over a year already, and I must say I am surprised with the results......

On the other hand, I think this camera needs some design modifications.......firstly, I think a lens cap or some sort of lens cover is definately a must.........always cleaning the lens is driving me nuts......secondly, the LCD panel is placed in such a way where either your hands would get in the way of it, or if you like using the viewfinder, people with big schnozzes would leave a nice print on the screen........what I found works great is to use some of them write rights (for palm pilots), if it gets dirty, its easy to clean, and if it gets scratched, then peel it off and install another one :)

The camera is a little slow at connecting with the computer, so I would recommend a card reader.

Also one big gripe I have is that regular batteries don't last too long....its better to invest in a good set of alkaline batteries, or even better yet, rechargables.

All this aside, I think the camera is really nice, takes really good quality pictures, and is very simple to use.

I would rate this one highly
