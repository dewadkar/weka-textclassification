<TEXT>
            I replaced my 1981 workhorse of a ford after much soul searching with a 99 Dodge Dakota extended cab slt.  I wanted to buy a Ford but got treated very badly by the sales people at the dealerships.  When i started looking into different brands Dodge was the first place I went.  After much research I decided to get the Dakota.  One because it has a very good rep, 2 because it is very nice to look at and 3 because I was treated with respect and dignity from the sales people.  the truck is the most comfortable ride I have ever had.  It is a bigger work horse than my old ford ever was as well as seems much more roomy.<br><br>
