            I owned an Audi A4, 2.8 Quattro for almost two years and I can't say as I regretted owning the car for a single day.  My particular car had a manual transmission and almost all the optional extras including the cold weather package (including the ski bag), the high end Bose Stereo and a sunroof. 

When considering which car to buy I looked at the BMW 328i, the Acura Integra, the Mitsubishi Mirage and others.  What I found is that the A4 offers the best value out there in terms of features and price/performance, especially in terms of a 4 wheel drive car.  Look and compare.  It's clearly several thousand dollars cheaper for the same feature set, despite the fact that the car, in my opinion, is just plain better than comparable offerings from BMW, Mercedes, Acura, Lexus, etc. 

From a driving perspective, the A4 is rock solid and the steering is exceptional.  I had a couple close calls in downtown traffic and also on the highway when I had to quickly turn the car and in each case it performed exceptionally.  The anti-lock breaks work well although you have to make sure to maintain them as mine starting squeaking a after a couple years of heavy use wore down the break shoes.

The Quattro, or 4 wheel drive, feature is excellent and made a difference on a number of occasions when I was either on mud or ice.  One big bonus of the Quatrro is that you qualify as a four wheel drive vehicle and can drive without chains on roads that require chains during the winter (such as I-80 during the winter near Lake Tahoe).  I had a lot of fun driving past all the other cars putting on their chains and passing right through the chain control check points even though the Audi wasn't a gigantic SUV.  In addition to that, the Quattro just gives you a better all around sense of confidence when you are driving. 

While the 4 wheel drive is great for slippery roads and winter weather, it doesn't mean that the Audi can double as a SUV primarily because the ground clearance is still pretty low, so if you do go &quot;off road&quot; you have a good chance of hitting the undercarriage on a rock.  (I found this out going down a pretty rough dirt road and a made a mental note from then on not to push the &quot;off road&quot; capabilities of the car!)

The 2.8 engine is more than adequate.  I had a manual transmission and the shifter was well designed and easy to use.  I would have liked just a little more horsepower, but the reality is that the 2.8 engine gives you more than enough power.  I test drove the 1.8 turbo and that seemed OK, but it wasn't as smooth as the 2.8 and appeared to work a lot harder (and a lot louder) to get the same amount of power.

I put almost 15,000 miles on the car and never had to do any engine maintenance.  I actually should have replaced the oil at 7,500 miles but procrastinated and never got around to it.  This is not something I'd recommend, but it didn't seem to effect the car.

The interior is generally great and very well designed.  The steering wheel both tilts and telescopes so it can accommodate just about any size driver.  Add that to the power seats and driving the car is very comfortable.  The back seats are very nice to sit in although the leg room for passengers is a little cramped.  If you expect to have back seat passengers a lot or to take them on very long trips, it might make more sense to consider an A6, but for short trips and moving around town with friends they are more than adequate. 

The ski bag was a particularly great feature if you're a skier.  This feature allows you to put 2-3 pairs of skis through a hole between the back seat and the trunk.  The ski bag is built into the back seat and expands as you push the skis from the trunk into the back seat.  The bag surrounds the skis and prevents and ice/water/mud from getting into the interior.  Because it goes through the middle of the back seat, two people can still sit in back with the bag in use.  Using the bag eliminates the need to buy/use a ski rack and protects your skis from theft without messing up your car.  Other cars have the same kind of features, but the Audi's seems to work particularly well.

The only negative comment I have on the interior is that Audi needs some better cup holders.  I understand that the new models have new cup holders, but you may want to make sure as the old ones weren't very useful.  One other negative comment is that the trip computer would stop working after 2 hours of driving and would not start working until you turned the car off and on again.   The idea was that you should pull over at least every two hours and this &quot;feature&quot; was designed to force you to do that.  What it did in reality was just annoy you.

I had no mechanical problems with the car other than what appeared to be an electrical short that happened 2 or 3 times.  When the short happened I could not use my wipers or my turn signals.  The short typically went away after a couple of drives, but it was weird and may have something to do with the large amount of fog in my neighborhood creating a pretty moist environment inside the engine.  Whatever it was, I never took the car in for service, although I suspect people that are more exacting probably would have taken it in the first time it happened.

The warranty on the car is very extensive primarily because Audi was the subject of some baseless claims about sudden acceleration in the early 1990's (there was a 60 Minutes story on it if I remember correctly), so the only way they could sell their cars was to put an incredibly attractive warranty on them as a sign that they stood by their cars.  At some point I wouldn't be surprise to see them reduce the scope the warranty (if they haven't already), but might as well get it while they are offering it!

Of course you may be asking yourself by now, &quot;If it was such a great car why aren't still driving it?&quot;  The answer to that is that I would still be driving it if it wasn't for the person who rear ended me while I was stopped at a red light.  Yes that's right, my beloved Audi was totaled by a inattentive and apparently slightly drunk motorist who hit the A4 smack dab in the middle of the rear bumper.

While this incident was a major downer, it does give me the ability to talk credibly about Audi's safety features, which as far as I can tell worked brilliantly.  The car that hit me (a brand new Acura Integra) was completely totaled (luckily the driver was basically unhurt).   I myself was also unhurt and was immediately able to get out the A4 and survey the damage.  On the surface the damage didn't look that bad.  The so called &quot;crush zones&quot; in the trunk had clearly buckled and absorbed most the impact, while the bumper was pushed down and into the back tires.  The cops and tow truck guys said that most cars rear ended at 25mph look a lot worse and that usually the person in the drivers seat at the very least has some neck injuries.  I felt fine and my seat belt worked great, so I have no complaints and nothing but complements for Audi and its team of safety engineers.

As it turned out the reason the car didn't look worse is that a lot of the stress from the crash was absorbed by the &quot;unibody&quot; or frame and as a result the unibody was bent (this was apparently not a good thing).  As a result, my insurance carrier declared the car a total loss and I got paid the full value.  So while the crash didn't cost me anything or hurt anyone, I did lose my beloved A4 which, frankly, sucked.

On the bright side of things, the crash has given me an excuse to buy the new Audi S4 (the enhanced version of the A4 with a bigger engine and twin turbos), which I will hopefully do within a month or two.  If you're looking for an A4 with more power and performance similar to an M3, the S4 is your ticket.  Hopefully, that car and I will have a happier ending!
