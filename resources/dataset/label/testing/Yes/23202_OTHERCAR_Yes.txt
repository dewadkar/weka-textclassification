            Pardon me for putting in my two cents worth, but I just test drove a '96 Honda Accord on everyone's recommendation.  It's not all that.  It's unsafe for small kids.  And, it shifts hard.  We looked at a '97 last year it shifted hard, too.

We got in the car with our two year old. And before we even took off, he had opened the door.  I don't know about these easy open doors.  But when a two year old can get one open, it's too easy.  In the car I have now you have to give the door handle a pull.  This one, he just flipped and it opened.  Then five minutes later, he had the window rolled down.  It didn't even have the halfway roll down feature on the back windows.  Let's see my son can unfasten his safety belt.  So in less than a minute, he could of fallen out the door.  Or in five minutes, he could of fallen out the window.  Family car my eye!

Some good points were the handling, the four doors, and the power for such a small car.  Ok, it's not that small.  But, I've driven other cars with the same size engines that had a lot less power.  It was a smooth ride except for shifting gears.  It has a good response time in both the steering and brakes.  And, I've always liked four doors for friends and family.  It would, probably, make a fine family car for a family whose kids are old enough to know to stay in their seatbelts and the car while it's moving.  <br><br>
