            Picture this.... You're driving through mountain passes, the roads wind around giving way to spectacular views of mountain streams, ranches, lakes and valleys.  You are trying to make good time because you want to make it to your campsite before dark.  You don't want a gas guzzler because your journey takes you over a long distance.  You want a reliable, economical, roomy vehicle that will handle like a truck or SUV...  The Suburu Outback is the answer!

My wife and I rented a 2000 Suburu Outback for our vacation out West, and we loved every minute of it.  The Outback handled offroad driving, highway driving, and driving on winding roads at a fairly good clip.

We loved the cruise control, comfortable seats, room to pack our gear, and the driving experience.  The drawbacks were that it did not have as much power as we would have liked.  We could feel the car's limits on some of the mountain passes.  Although the car gets good gas mileage (I figured around 25 miles/gallon), it was no fuel miser either.

This vehicle is for the outdoors lover, the home improvement guru, and the family.  This vehicle is not for the city dweller, the 50 mile + commuter to work, or the power hungry SUV/Truck driver.

Overall, the Suburu Outback would be a welcome addition to the outdoorsy family, sports oriented family, and the do-it-yourselfers who need a little extra room in the back and a roof rack.
