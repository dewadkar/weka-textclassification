            I bought this car new mostly because of the price. I was at a Credit Union sale where I wasn't hassled by car dealers and all cars were offered at the lowest prices. I hadn't researched Tracers but it caught my eye because of the design, and after I found out the price new, decided to test drive it. I ended up buying it and have not regretted it. Sure, it's fairly small, and there's not a lot of room in the back seat, but the trunk is roomy and can be extended by putting the back seat down.

It gets great gas mileage, particularly on the highway, and handles well. It's never going to come anywhere near an Explorer, which probably costs over 3 times what the Tracer does - it darn well better ride better have lots more bells and whistles, and be roomier. I was rear-ended and drove a Taurus SE for 3 weeks, and must admit, I would have traded my Tracer for it, but wouldn't have traded the car payments. So, if you're looking for a reasonably priced car which is reliable, or need a good, less expensive second car, I can recommend this one. I've not had any trouble with it for three years now. <br><br>
