            In 1992 I owned my first Camry. Loved it I did. By 95 I updated it to a 94 Camry Le. This one was even better. Now in 2000 I was looking at the LS Saturn and almost bought one. I was comparing a 2000 Saturn to a 1994 Camry. Yet when I tried driving a newer Camry 1999, there was still no comparasion. As the advertisment states &quot;Oh what feeling&quot; I've had two other Camry owners ask me about my 99 white camry LE. This car makes driving such a pleasure, about the only thing they could do to improve upon it, is having the car park itself. I could go on for days raving about this car. Just take one for a test drive and you'll see.  <br><br>
