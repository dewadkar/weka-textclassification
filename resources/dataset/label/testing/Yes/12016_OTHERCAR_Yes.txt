            Ok, have now had the S2000 for 7 months.  Overall we have been extremely pleased, and nothing has broken off or even rattles, which surprised me for a brand-new basically hand-built car.

The biggest pro for me has been that it is a Honda.  Test drove the boxster, SLK, and others and always felt too pretentious.  People snicker at a Porsche, but they still cheer with the Honda goes by, even 7 months on.  The silver with red interior is beautiful.  It is also shockingly fast when you wind it up, I've surprised an F355 and a butt-ugly Diablo roadster.  I've never had a car this fast, and it's almost a waste, because there is no way I can really use even 80% of it in an even close-to-legal fashion.  The controls are awesome, everything from the extra stereo controls at your left hand, to the short shift, to the simple environmental controls at your right hand.  

The biggest con is how cramped it is.  I'm 5'11, 175, and I fit OK in the driver's seat, but it's not exactly comfortable over distance.  And the passenger seat is painful, my knees bang into the bolster.  The ride is also harsh, although a lot less so than my Toyota truck.  Overall it really is not a comfortable car.  Also, the stereo really sucks (it needs speakers integrated into the seats or at least another set besides the crappy ones down in the doors), and the plastic rear window is a disappointment.  But ignore negative comments on the power top; it works great and makes the car a lot more fun, it's worth the weight.  Also, the wind blocker really works, it should be standard.

ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY UPDATE:

We've now had the S2000 for a little more than a year.  We've since added a 230hp Saab Aero wagon to the arsenal and it's changed our views on the S2000 a bit.  Frankly, the S2000 stays in the garage a lot more.  The S2000 is still stunning and wickedly fast.  But it's pretty uncomfortable on long rides, is loud, and perhaps most importantly, is too cramped in the cabin, especially the passenger seat, which has no knee room to speak of.  Also, the rear window is scratched and becoming a bit opaque, nothwithstanding using the cleaners Honda recommended.  There are also quite a few rattles on rough surfaces from the top well (although the rest of the car, including the dash, is impressively rattle free after a year).  

Basically it's moved from a dailyish driver to a weekend/fair weather car, which is probably fine, and where it belongs. 

TWO-AND-A-HALF YEAR ANNIVERSARY UPDATE:

The rattles found at year 1 were cured -- they were due to worn-out tape that stops the various layers of the metal top when folded from coming in contact with each other.

2.5 years & 30,000 miles on, from a quality perspective, the car is very impressive, and the fit-and-finish still looks mostly brand new.  It has never broken down or left us stranded.  The ride is still harsh (although a little better now with S-03 rather than OEM S-02 tires) and we don't look forward to long trips in the S2000.  But ordering some third party headrests actually went a long way in improving comfort -- now our heads have somewhere to rest.

Next car may have to be an Acura 3.2 CL-S - best of the S2000 and the Saab 9-5 Aero is one.
