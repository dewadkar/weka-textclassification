            Standing 5'9", I don't have the headroom or legroom problems some people have with cars. The Contour was my company lease car for 2 years and I enjoyed its European handling characteristics and economy.

Engine:
The Contour LX was equipped with the Zetec 4-cylinder which was a nice match to the 5-speed manual transmission. It made the otherwise tame looking 4-door sedan quite the handler in the city. Good gas mileage- this is a once a week tank to fill.

Handling:
The Contour's strong suit - called the Ford Mondeo in Europe, the Contour is Audi-like in handling. Great in curves and tight spaces. Excellent traction in wet weather or snow.

Interior:
Ergonomically-superior dash unfortunately made of cheap plastic. But the gauges and dials are in the right place and the dash is very modern. The front seats were firm and comfortable though the rear seats were a bit tight for tall people. Trunk was a good size - back seats in some models can fold down for pass-through space.

Quality:
I had no problems with the Contour for the 2 years of my lease.

Value:
Since the Contour has been discontinued by Ford, you can pick up a used one or new one that's deeply discounted. I think it's a very good 4-door sedan. Styling is European. Engineering is all in place. Interior space is only a concern if you're over 6' tall.
