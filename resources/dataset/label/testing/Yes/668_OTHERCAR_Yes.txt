            Last Fall I was shopping for a digital camera because I have always loved photography, however the prohibitive cost of film and developing was too much for my hobby budget. I explored as many different digital cameras as I could find. Many were passable, some were ok, but only a handful were outstanding. The most outstanding was the Nikon Coolpix 950. Once I saw what kind of quality images this camera is capable of producing, there was no other choice. I must admit that I plunged and paid $950.00 when the camera was only on the market for a short time. It was worth every penny! The quality of the way it captures colors is magnificent, and the images are incredible. I have played with several digital cameras of varying quality and price, and none of them so far have equaled the Coolpix.
Since buying the Nikon Coolpix, I have become a professional photographer around the San Francisco Bay Area. Often I do shoots of live performances, particularly bands. What I want to point out is that the swivel feature on the Coolpix is one of the features I could not live without. It makes it possible for me to hold the camera at arms length above my head and still be able to see the LCD screen to frame the shot.
I would list some ideas for improving the next model, but it looks like Nikon has already done that with the newer Coolpix 990. Also, I want to add that many of these digital cameras are tough on batteries, and the Nikon is one of the best cameras for battery/use ratio, especially with rechargeable batteries which I recommend. The workmanship and the case on the camera do not have a flimsy feel to them. It feels solid like a tool.
  This product gets my absolute highest recommendation. I won't go into the details of the features. You can find numerous websites which list all the cameras features. I will say however that if you are looking to invest $600 in a digital camera, this is the best buy for the price. 
  I'm saving my photography earnings to buy another one for use as a backup.
