            We recently purchased our 4th Honda...a 2000 Honda Accord EX V6. All i can say is WOW !!!! what a difference from our last 4 cyl Accord.
As i said we have had 4 Accords since 1991......all have been Excelent !!!
To me it is the most reliable car on the road and a GREAT VALUE for the money. We bought the car in July of 2000 for not much more than we paid for the last Accord we purchased in 1996 (except for $2,000 more for the V6). The car is comfortable....very fast.....responsive and still gets pretty good gas mileage (about 24MPG). It has so much more acceleration speed with the V6 while not giving up the very important gas mileage. It is jsut a FUN car to drive. I have a 1999 Cadillac Seville also and the quality of the Honda and dependability is far superior to the Cadillac.
I would recommend this car for virtually everyone. A student needing a economical car to drive tht is reasonable on insurance to the older widowed woman that needs a reliable car to get her to and from shopping and church with no repairs and no break downs on a dark road. As i said this is our 4th Honda.....When the lease is up on my Cadillac Seville i plan to replace it with a Honda SUV.<br><br>
