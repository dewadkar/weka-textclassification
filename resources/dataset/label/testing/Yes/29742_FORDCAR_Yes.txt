            I recently bought a '97 Ford 4WD Explorer XLT after years of owning an '88 Isuzu Trooper. I need a 4WD vehicle because I live in an elevated area that occasionally ices up. I also like lots of room for my hobbies of cycling and camping. I have found the Explorer to be the best vehicle I have ever owned. It overcomes all the shortcomings of the Trooper that I was aware of and some I never thought about. 

The 6-cyl OHC engine is powerful, and surprisingly gives me close to about the same gas mileage around town as the 4-cylinder Trooper, about 17 mpg. The fact that I live on a mountain may keep that figure from being any better. The smooth 5-speed automatic transmission is a pleasure, after years of wondering whether my Trooper was going to lose all its gears as it screamed going up the hills. The Explorer is very maneuverable with a tight turning radius. 

All the controls are convenient and ergonomically designed. It was easy to locate all the dashboard, wiper, and lighting functions. It has more power accessories that I really wanted, but the electric locks and remote locking control are a great convenience in a five door vehicle. The inside storage configuration is ample, and I can easily put two bicycles inside or all my camping gear, and I like to camp comfortably. 

It has a sound system to die for, with both a CD changer and tape player. The tape player allows the radio to play while it's rewinding, a nice feature I never thought about asking for. And the bass has an exciting punch, whether I'm listening to a Bach organ prelude or ZZ Top.

We recently had a spell of cold weather, and the car heated up quickly and was easy to make a comfortable temperature. 

There is a lack of inside stowage for small items, partly because the front underseat area is taken up by the power seat mechanism. And the heavy window tinting (which may have been added by the last owner) causes poor rear visibility at night.

After years of owning Japanese vehicles, I'm impressed by the quality and attention to details of this Ford product. I'm a happy camper with this one.<br><br>
