            I have owned the 1999 model for 6 months now. It has fulfilled my 60s fantasy to own a Beetle but it has had a few disappointments. The horn does not go beep-beep, it sounds like a horn from a much larger car. The black interior shows all the dirt, hair, and dust you collect. Impossible to keep clean. My favorite color is yellow and I pay for that with a dirty car most of the time. The splash pattern from inclement weather is very noticable. It is fun to drive but I have had problem with the auto transmission leaking fluid from day one so it has affected the get up and go. Also they are having problems with the trunk hatch (in the back now.) It has an unlock button on the driver side door as well as on the key. If you hit the button on the door and walk around to the back (normal pace) the lock has relocked itself. They have tried 3 times to adjust this and so far no luck. The only other negative feature is the plastic overhead storage box/compartment, during really warm weather it fell apart. They replaced it but now it's winter so I will have to wait and see. What I love about the beetle: it is a fun car to own, other people love it, talk to you about it, other beetles owners wave to you. The new clock and temp display is handy. The neon look of the lighted dash is sooooo cool and the stereo system is great. The safety features on the beetle are very comforting in knowing they are there. Great car to share with my daughter.<br><br>
