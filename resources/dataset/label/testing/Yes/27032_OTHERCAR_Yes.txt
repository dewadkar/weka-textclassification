             This past Autumn, I was looking to purchase a digital camera. I did the research, I looked at a lot of different models, before I finally narrowed it down to just a few. You see, one of the most important features for me was that it have a 3x optical zoom as well as the 2x digital. This alone narrowed my choices considerably. Another must was high quality optics which meant that I would only consider cameras made by the &quot;better&quot; film camera manufacturers. This left me with essentially two choices in my price range (since i've never been big on Kodak products), one from Olympus and the other from Minolta. From here it boiled down to price and here the Olympus won hands down. I've read the other reviews written on this camera at epinions and can't believe that some people think they got a deal on it paying $500, I got mine for $396 before shipping.
 Now that i've had the camera for a while, what do I think of it? I have absolutely no complaints. It takes such great pictures in the lowest resolution, I can't think of any reason to use the higher settings except if i'm planning to blow it up to a much larger size. It's nice not to have to worry about taking a bad photo, because i'm not paying any film or developing costs and I can just erase it. I've since purchased a USB card reader from SIIG, rechargeable nickel-metal hydride batteries, and a 32 mb smartmedia card that holds nearly 500 pictures at low resolution. That's a lot of pictures to take without having to reload. I haven't used all it's features yet, just the macro, but I can tell you that with all the features it does have, as well as the high quality optics, and the trust the Olympus brand name implies, that you won't find a better camera anywhere for the price.<br><br>
