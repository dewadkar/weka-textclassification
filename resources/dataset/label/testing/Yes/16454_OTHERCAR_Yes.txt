            Well, where do I start ? Back in 1995 I was looking for a practical replacement for my wife's aging 1984 Chevy Cavalier daily driver- that would double as a family car. Went to an auction with a car dealer friend, there sits an A-title, one-owner 91 Saturn SL2, manual trans, 98,000 miles. Ended up getting it for $4500. Mileage seemed very high, but turned out to be a non-factor. These cars easily run to 200,000 miles and beyond. 

Right off, this car has AMAZING power for a 4-cylinder engine !! Being a hot rodder, motor head, drag racer, and having a Degree in Auto Tech, I noticed some things. The Saturn SL2 DOHC 1.9 Liter engine, has HEMI/PENTROOF COMBUSTION CHAMBERS in the cylinder head, DOUBLE ROLLER timing chain, FACTORY steel tubing exhaust header (tri-y design for low end torque), TWIN OVERHEAD CAMS, PORT FUEL INJECTION, and VARIABLE IGNITION TIMING, the latter 2 controlled by a computer- by monitoring exhaust temp., coolant temp., outside air temp., engine vacuum, throttle position, and vehicle speed.  All in all, a VERY SOPHISTICATED and TROUBLE FREE system for such a cheap car !! The HEMI HEAD is by far the best combustion chamber any engine could have, that's why NHRA TOP FUEL DRAGSTERS also use it !!  The engine also has 4 VALVES PER CYLINDER for increased airflow, and a trouble free CRANK SENSOR/COIL PACK IGNITION that will NEVER LEAVE YOU STRANDED.  Bottom line, this engine has EVERY HOT ROD TRICK IN THE BOOK, straight from the factory.  The block and head are cast aluminum for weight savings, and the block has HARDENED STEEL LINERS for long life. When I pulled the engine apart to replace 2 valves, the machining cross-hatch pattern was still in the cylinders at 137,000 miles. This is amazing- practically NO cylinder bore wear ! Take it from me, I've been wrenching on cars for nearly 25 years- they didn't spare the horses when they designed the Saturn DOHC 1.9 liter !  (BTW, avoid the Saturn base model SOHC engine, that one is a dog, I test drove a new one back in '91)

Transmission, 5-speed manual has a GRANNY LOW like a truck for great take off torque, but an OVERDRIVE 5th gear for great gas mileage. My Saturn EASILY gets 27-30 mpg average driving, and on the highway with premium fuel, gets 38-42 MPG !! WOW- you forget when the last time was, you filled it up. 

Ride is smooth on smooth roads. Moderate road noise. One thing, this car REQUIRES snow tires, to be safe in winter ice/snow conditions. Summer tires or even "all weather" tires just won't do. The car is TOO LIGHT to get traction.  Actually it needs snow tires all, cuz the back end will spin around with summer tires, in snow.  I spun it around into old cable/post guide rail the second day I had it, on slush. Fortunately, no damage, just a little scratch- due the the plastic body absorbing the impact.

GREAT RUST FREE PLASTIC BODY. This car is now 12 years old and looks 6 years old. It is starting to get surface rust around the side windows on metal areas. 

THIS CAR NOW HAS 192,000 miles on it and running strong !! GREAT CAR !! 

One thing I really liked, was ability to fold the back seats down, and use the car like a station wagon, I had an 8-foot stepladder in it. Also took disassembled V-8 engines to machine shop in it, they weighed 500 lbs. (but put cardboard down first !!)

GREAT fishing/hunting etc. car, lots of room for stuff with seats down. Brought home over 1000 old 78 rpm records in it also.

REPAIRS- it burned 2 valves once, because the catalytic converter was blocked.  Mind you, it still ran with the burned valves- not a breakdown ! I pulled the head and replaced them myself. I used to be a mechanic, no biggie to me. Bottom end has never been rebuilt. One note, I changed entire drivetrain (engine/trans) over to AMSOIL SYNTHETIC OIL when I bought it, and still use it. Get this: OIL CHANGED AT 20,000 MILE INTERVALS, with adding in between, and filter change every 10,000 miles.  Use synthetic, it's worth it and it works.  Mineral based oil is as outdated as the Model T it was designed for. 

I also put a clutch in myself at 180,000 miles. It didn't go, I replaced it as a preventive measure, still had orginal clutch. 

TWEAKING TRICK FOR MILEAGE/POWER- I disconnected the EGR valve, after I had the car a week. Here in Pa. we can do that, no emission tests. Easy to do, just pull one little vacuum hose and plug it with something (I used a piece of a pencil cut off) EGR stand for "exhaust gas recirculation". Problem with the Saturns is, the orifice size is too large from the factory. So it dilutes the incoming air/fuel charge with exhaust a wee bit too much, and cuts down on power. Actually EGR's are on most cars since 1973, and they compromise mileage and power greatly.  WOW what a difference with the EGR blocked !  LOTS more power, smoother acceleration, the the car chirps the tires when shifting 1-2.  It'll also burn the tires in first if revved and dumped, dragster style. Not bad for a 4-cyl., eh ?? Still disconnected to this day. Some of you may no doubt frown on this. That's ok, then live with a compromised engine !  The EGR valve was a poor excuse for an emission control from day one- a band aid on a cancer.

NOTE- the original exhaust system, stainless steel coated, and muffler, lasted to the 190,000 mile mark. The converter was replaced at 137,000 miles cuz it was blocked. NO BS !!

CONS- The car is a bit cramped for long trips. It really was rough going to Massachusetts, from Pennsylvania, with the family on a 450 mile ride. (3 people). Back aches and fatigue, hmmm. Too bad it isn't just a TAD bigger ??  Even though is has great power for a 4-cyl (124 HP), it is outclassed on the highway now, by the big V-8 SUV's and luxury cars, of course. But they don't get 40 mpg !!

The clear coat is starting to get thin and peel here and there, but very minor. We have bad acid rain here, and the roof, trunk, and hood show it. Clear peeling excessively around headlights- I hid it with a bra. 

I had to replace the AC compressor and alternator at 140,000 miles. No biggie, expected at that mileage. AC blows ice cold with recharge. 

If you get hit in this car, not much protection against bigger vehicles. I never got hit, but look out. 

OTHER OPTIONS- SL2's come optioned out with POWER WINDOWS, POWER LOCKS, AIR CONDITIONING, CRUISE CONTROL, TILT WHEEL, FACTORY GAUGES, AM/FM/CASSETTE, FLIP DOWN BACK SEATS, AUTOMATIC SEAT BELTS, OVERDRIVE TRANSMISSION, REAR WINDOW DEFOGGER, DELAY WINDOW WIPERS, PASS. SIDE POWER MIRROR, POWER STEERING, POWER FRONT DISC BRAKES. Except as previously noted, all theses options work flawlessly to this day.
