            I purchased my Alero when I was looking for a car to get better gas mileage than the Bravada I owned.  I have always liked Oldsmobile ever since I was a child.  I heard they had gone downhill in the quality of cars they were producing, but if this is a poor quality car then I don't need anything better.  
     My car is a GL2 4 door model which has everything except the leather seats, larger tires and rims that a GLS model has.  I have tried everything with this car.  I love it. 
     The car has variable speed assisted steering, which means that the slower you are going, the less effort it takes on your part to turn the wheel.  
     The stereo also has a speed sensitive volume control, so as the engine revs higher, the stereo will compensate for the added noise by increasing the volume.  This feature is capable of being turned off, which should please those people who want to actually read the owners manual.  
     This car is very nimble and very fast with the V6.  I have found out that the inhibitor kicks in at about 107 miles an hour.  When I found that out, the engine had no trouble keeping the speed and seemed more than willing to go over that if the inhibitor wasn't attached.  Also at that rate of speed it felt as if I was only doing 65.  The steering I mentioned earlier accounts for that feel.  This is an unassuming car that delivers sports car like performance, with the economy of a sedan.  
     I drive 19 miles one way to work every day with 50% driving in the city and 50% driving on the highway, and the V6 gives me an average of 26 miles to the gallon, which is better than many 4 cylinder engines I have seen.
     The only change I have made to the car is to tint the windows, so they look better with the Silver exterior.  
     I have only had the car in the shop once for a service engine soon light.  The problem was my car didn't have a higher altitude (I live in the Rocky Mountains) program installed.  The dealership installed the program for me and I haven't noticed any change.  In no way was this problem a danger to the quality of the car.  
     The suspension is a little tight for an Oldsmobile, but since I used to drive a Bravada, I didn't find it too disappointing.  Some people may not like it for this reason if they are used to a larger luxury car.  Plus if the suspension needs to be tight to keep the car on the road at 107 miles an hour, then I like it tight.  
     Finally the seats are 6 way adjustable power seats with an adjustable lumbar support.  I have driven my car all day and actually felt refreshed when I got out.  
     If you want an all around performance car, then you can't go wrong with the Alero.
