            After having driven my Dodge Intrepid for 7 years (5 years Eagle Vision, 2 years Intrepid) and scared to find out what was going to go wrong today, the Toyota has been a breath of fresh air.  My girl friend has just bought a 95 Toyota 4-Runner and let me drive it.  I really liked how far off the ground it was and it was really fun to drive.  I decided I wanted one, and started hunting.  Unfortunately, there was not one to be found in our area.  I guess people keep them once they have them.  

I started hunting on the Internet, and found one about a 2 1/2 mile drive from where I lived.  It has been the best purchase I have made in a long time. My friend paid $16,000 for hers, and I found it for $11,000 with 10,000 fewer miles.  They had it for 6 months sitting on their lot, because they said they were in &quot;Red Neck&quot; country and no one there would buy a Toyota (Go figure).  They just wanted it off their lot and gave me a GREAT deal.  I could probably turn around and sell it here for more than I paid for it, but I wont!  We are union people and have always bought American, but I finally had had enough of my American car.

 I realize I have only had it for 5 months, but you don't understand that I would have had about 5 repairs on my Intrepid in that time.  There has been absolutely nothing wrong with the 4-Runner.  It is so wonderful to know that it will start every time I get in it.  The transmission will work and the wheel won't fall off.

Its not beautiful like my Intrepid, but there comes a time in your life that dependability is much more important that beauty.  It has plenty of room inside.  Haven't had to use my husband's pick-up truck yet.  The only downfall I have come across is that it doesn't get very good gas mileage, approximately 15 miles a gallon.  My car got much better, however, I feel I am saving a lot of money by not having it fixed all the time.  

I would buy another Toyota 4-Runner in a heartbeat.  Go for it!
