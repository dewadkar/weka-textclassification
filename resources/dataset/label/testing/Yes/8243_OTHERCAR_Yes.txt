            So far, my wife and I have had this camera for a little bit longer than a month.  We have had no problems with it.  It takes brilliant pictures, even in the VGA mode.  We usually take pictures in the 1 megapixel (Norm) mode.  This is the perfect balance between quality and volume of pictures you can take.  

Like most reviews state, the camera really goes through the batteries.  We bought some NiMH rechargeable batteries (don't use NiCd)and they seem to last better than regular Alkaline and of course they are rechargeable.  Always have a charged set with you and you never have any problems.  

The Camera itself is small, lightweight, looks great, and is really easy to use.  We just plug the USB cable into the computer and Windows XP automatically recognizes it and asks us what we want to do with the pictures.  I can not say enough about how easy it is to use.

My only complaint with the camera is when I try to take action shots.  There seems to be a very slight delay between the time I press the button and when it actually captures the image.  You can always compensate a little by taking the picture a split second before.  I have found that this works in most cases, but you never now until you look at the pictures.  Of course since there is no film to develop, we take lots of pictures and just erase the ones that we don't like.

As far as quality is concerned...this camera is the absolute best for the money.  My wife has really gotten into scrap booking.  She takes all the pictures she wants and then will print them out in whatever size she needs.  If you have a high quality printer for your PC, you truly can get "Photo Quality" prints.  The only real limitation you have to great prints is your printer, not this camera.
