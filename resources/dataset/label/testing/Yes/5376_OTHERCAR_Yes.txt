            I bought this vehicle purely because I was ready to get a car and when I drove it, I fell in love with it.  I had the 1994 Nissan Sentra Limited Edition.  It was a 5-speed, 2-door.  I loved that car for the sheer fact that it was a great car to own.  It was fun to drive and easy to take care of and got great gas mileage.  It was also a very loyal car to me.  I bounced off walls, curbs, even a parked car, and my little Dentra kept on going.  It even ran good for 3 months while I used to e-brake to stop.  Now, I'm not saying that everyone should go out and get a Sentra and do what I did to it, but I will say that it is a great car to own and would be a good car to give to your teenager as a first car.  It's very simple to take care of and if treated right (unlike mine was) it can be a great car to own the rest of your life.  <br><br>
