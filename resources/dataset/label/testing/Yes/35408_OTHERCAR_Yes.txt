            I haven't driven this car around the city, but on the highway, it's terrible. There is no room in the back, and it's loud and unstable. I actually felt a little unsafe in this car. It is tall and small and in an accident, I would be pretty worried. 

I found the biggest problem with this car was the size. In fact, the size of everything. The interior and engine most specifically. The price is pretty good, but I really don't think it is worth it. I felt very uncomfortable in this car. The seats are hard with no support or room. The rear seats seem to be raised (like the Xterra- stadium seating) but the sight lines are still poor, and the head room gets really bad. If you are over six feet, it will be a squeeze. There is very little storage space also. You can't really put as many bags in the back as occupants you have in the car. If you are going on family vacation, you may need a roof rack.  
The engine is small (2.0 L) and really doesn't move the car well. Even to get to 40 or 50 m.p.h. on a highway (not and interstate, just a state road) the engine gets so loud. I have been in cars that get close to this loud, but they are getting to 60 or 70 m.p.h. in under 10 seconds. Part of the problem is that there is not noise protection throughout the car. The wind noise is also a big problem; it's hard to have a conversation in this car on the highway. I didn't really get a chance to test the suspension of this car, but the off-road capabilities are not that great. None of these mini SUVs are really off-roaders. The handling isn't terrible, but this is no sporty car. 

This car reminds me of a Ford Festiva 4x4 with four doors. While there is no Festiva 4x4, this is as close as it gets. I actually like the Festiva, but its disadvantages are similar to the Suzukis. I wouldn't buy an SUV if this is the only one you can afford. Look at a midsize car (Chevy Malibu, Ford Contour, Saturn LS). If you really want a mini SUV, here are some good choices:

Land Rover Freelander (new for 2001)- This is a new entry from Land Rover. It has been on sale in Europe for a year and is now available with a V6. This makes it a great entry in the US. It has the most off-road capabilities in the class, and shouldn't be very expensive. 

The RAV4 and CR-V- These are very popular mini SUV's and are larger and more reliable than the Suzuki. They don't really have any off-road capabilities. 

Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute (new for 2001)- I haven't really heard much about these cars, but the Tribute is being marketed as a sporty SUV and the Escape has received very good initial reviews. One magazine said that they thought it was one of the best SUVs on the road (I believe it was either Motor Trend or Road and Track).
