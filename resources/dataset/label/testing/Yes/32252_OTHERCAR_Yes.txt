            Hubby and I bought this 1-ton truck new and have enjoyed it ever since!  The reason we wanted a 1-ton is because we needed it to pull our 32 ft. camper.  It is a great vehicle to pull a travel trailer with!

We opted for the four-door, extended cab model because we have three daughters.  The back seat is very roomy and comfortable.  In fact, the seats are one of the most comfortable I've seen in any vehicle!  This model has lots of room so those of you with families--don't worry!

This truck has a 454 engine and does use more gas than a regular truck.  However, since we do need the 1-ton to pull the travel trailer we expected that.  I guess this would be the only drawback that I can think of on this model. 

We started out with a 1997 1-ton Chevy truck with a disel engine.  We had continuous trouble with the injectors going out.  The dealer got tired of replacing them and finally offered us a great offer on the newer model.  We jumped on this of course.  No regrets on the gasoline engine at all.

This truck has been virtually trouble free except for routine maintenance.  Thumbs up! <br><br>
