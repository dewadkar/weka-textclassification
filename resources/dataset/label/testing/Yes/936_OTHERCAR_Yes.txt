            <B>Intoduction/How I ended up with a van</B><P>
I was driving my 6 month old SAAB wagon back from Home Depot when a Caddy runs a light at 50 mph, Broadsides me, destroying the car.  I was not hurt, and was alone in the car (thank g*d...if my wife or three month old were in the car, I could not have forgiven myself).  (Off topic:  SAAB did great from a safety stand point.  I have a detailed review of that).  We had to buy a new vehicle.  Insurance company gave us 3 days of rental.  I wanted another SAAB -- I liked its safety.  However, my wife found it hard to get the baby in and out of the center position of the SAAB.  So, we decided to get a Minivan.  Because of my recent experience, Safety was the number one concern, followed by use/flexibility, reliability and cost. I only considered the Sienna, Honda Odyssey, and Ford Windstar.<P>
<B> Safety</B><P>
I did not crash test the minivan, so I can not say first hand.  However, the van is 5 star and a best pick.  Almost as good (according the feds) was the Odyssey and Windstar.  My requirement was side airbags....I now see how they can make a difference.  With the Sienna in my area (DC), that required the Symphony package.  The car also has Antilock breaks, seatbelt pre-tensioners, and a full size spare.  Mine did not come with he stability control; however, I do not plan driving hard.<p>
Overall order for safety:  Sienna, Windstar then Odyssey (but it is really a 3 way tie).
<B>Reliability</B><P>
The Sienna is a Toyota.  It has the highest rated reliability (according to consumer reports).  Not much more I can say about that.  Except, I have not had any problems in the two weeks.  One thing though, there is a lot of space under the hood.<P>
Overall: (according to Consumer Reports):  Sienna, Odyssey, Windstar.  However, to access the spare tire in the Honda, the center seats need to be removed.
<b>Use</b>
Use (for me) is defined by ease of getting in and out of the rear seat, ease of removing the rear seat, and flexibility in the rear seat configuration.  This is simple.  The Odyssey has the best rear seat removal (fold down).  However, it is not a split bench.  The Sienna is a split bench. You can remove just one of the rear seats in the Sienna, or old down only one.  With the Windstar, you must remove the entire seat or fold down the entire seat.  As for rear seat access, again the Odyssey wins, because you can configure the middle seat as either bench or captains chairs.  The Sienna and Windstar do not offer that flexibility.<p>
Overall Ranking:  Odyssey, Sienna, Windstar.<P>
<B>Out the door cost for immediate delivery (DC area)</B><P>
Toyota Sienna Symphony:  25,200
Ford Windstar SE: 27,500
Honda Odyssey EX: 33,200 (only one dealer had it in stock, and required all kinds of dealer installed options).

<B>Test Drive</B><p>
I only drove the Toyota; Honda's were not available, and we liked the Toyota more than the Ford. <P>
Driving position is good.  Visibility is good with logical instrumentation.  Nothing is really distracting.  Seat comfort is OK (not as good as my wrecked SAAB).  Engine starts easily.  A/C is very good. (We drove it in 100 degree Washington DC heat).  Pickup was ok.  The engine does not have a lot of low end torque.  However, once it wound past about 3500 RPM, it was peppy.  Cornering...well, it is ok.  There was some lean.  I did not corner hard.  I did not feel that I could corner hard.  But, again, I was used to a SAAB.  The ride is very good; it rides like a Camry.<p>
<B>Other Factors</B><p>
All seats were comfortable in the Sienna and Odyssey.  Not in the Windstar.  The car seat was easy to in the Sienna.  I did not try with the other vehicles.  The remaining factors only apply to the Sienna:  car buzzes if placed in gear with a side door open.  The emergency break took some getting used too (Push in, then push again to release; if you pull the leaver above the break, the hood pops up. Argh!!!!!)  The car has a lot of cup holders (big plus over the SAAB.)
<P>
One or two minor quality complaints about the Toyota:  Some of the interior does not seem that well constructed.  For example, the front passenger airbag shows a gap at the edge.  Also, the covering of the break (rubber) came off once while driving.  And I have noticed a few rattles in the dashboard.<P>  
<B>Ownership</b><p>
We bought the Sienna.  We have had the van for about two weeks, and we have put about 300 miles on the van.  In that time, we have had no problems, other than minor issues (airbag gap, rubber break cover).  We have driven with 1 adult + infant, up to 4 adults + infant.  With 4 adults, one had to go in the back row.  It was somewhat difficult for him to get back there, but he found it comfortable ï¿½ much more so than in the SAAB, which was cramped with 4 adults + infant in the car.  The sound system seems a to have too much bass.  I really do not have much to say about driving this van.  It does not instill passion.  That is not a bad thing. It moves the family.  There is enough room to get all of the baby equipment in the van, and still seat 5 adults comfortably (or six with thee cramped).  If there is one thing I could change it is the placement of the hood release.  I keep opening the hood when I want to release the parking break. 
<B> Summary</B><p>
The Sienna is an excellent minivan.  It is safe (according to experts).  It is comfortable and flexible.  It drives well.  However, if I could buy an Odyssey at sticker price (27,000), I would have probably bought that over the Sienna.
