            Hewlett Packard has learned a thing or two from industry leading Sony about making a good digital camera.  Sony has always been number one in digital cameras, but companies like Hewlett Packard are catching up quickly.  One of Hewlett Packard's best digital camera's this year is the HP 315xi.  This is a 2.1 megapixel camera that provides great quality picture.  A 2.1 megapixel digital camera will give you very close to the same photo quality as a regular camera.  This is a large step up from the C200, Hewlett Packard's last lower priced digital camera.  The camera does include PC, and Mac compatibility.  A 8mb compact flash card for storing photo's, and a extensive collection of photo edition software.  The 315xi version also includes a full version of the Adobe Photo Deluxe Buisness edition.  Also included with the 315, and 315xi are the Arcsoft Photo Montage 2000, and the Arcsoft Photo Impression 2000.  One of the best things about this camera is the ease of use.  Really, you only need to point and click to take pictures.  This is almost certainly the best valued digital camera on the PC/Mac market at this time.  It's actually hard to believe that you get all of this for just $299.00 to $349.00.  Transferring your pictures to PC is very easy with the USB connection.  There is also the possibility of using a compact flash card for direct printing.  This is possible with any Hewlett Packard Printer with the card slot.  Possible models include the P1000, P1100, 1215, and the 1218.  Here is a list of everything included in the box of this fine Hewlett Packard product.
