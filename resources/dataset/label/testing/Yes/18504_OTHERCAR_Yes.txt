            Although I have read, and rated epinions, I am new to writing them, but I was so impressed with the 2002 Passat that we test drove, that I felt I had to let everyone know.

My wife and I are looking for a new family sedan.  We have been driving Pontiac Grand Ams, but are ready for a change.  A friend suggested that we check out the VW Passat.  Boy was I impressed!

Some of the necessities that the Passat had that we are looking for are affordibility, they have been rated one of the safest family sedans, and since we live in the country, great fuel economy.

Some of the perks of the Passat are they are available in 12 different colors.  Surely my wife and I can agree on one with that many choices. It is available in a sedan or station wagon.  Also the Passat is made with an optional V-6 engin which my wife likes to have.

The car is available in three different models, the GLS, the GLS-V-6, and the GLX.  The GLX is the more luxury model.  We are looking at the GLS-V-6.  The car has 4-Motion System for 4 wheel drive.  This is a traction control devise that helps you out in a slide, or low traction areas.  The Passat also has all the standard safety features.

The interior is well set up, easy to read and figure out.  The car comes with heated leather seats with 3 position memory control.

From the test drive that we took, I would say that the Passat handles well, and has plenty of power.  It was enjoyable to drive.

Needless to say, we are leaning heavily toward the Passat as our next car purchase.
