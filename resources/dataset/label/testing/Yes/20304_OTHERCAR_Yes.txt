                 I have recently purchased a 2002 Rodeo Sport and I must say I am thoroughly impressed thus far with it.  I had stopped by the Isuzu dealership on a Sunday just to get a look at the Rodeos and Rodeo Sports but didn't have any real inclination to trade anytime soon.  I was still driving my 2000 Firebird, that after two years had never given me a single problem and still ran very well.  My interest in the Rodeo's was purely to see what they were asking price wise and what the options lists included.  Since I do a lot of camping and outdoor activity I knew that sooner or later I would need a vehicle that would meet the task.  I picked Sunday to stop in because the dealership was closed and I could look over the selection without some salesman hawking overhead waiting to strike.
     As it happened, there was a salesman there in the dealership doing some paperwork.  I had no idea he was there but he came out and we started discussing the Rodeo Sports.  I just didn't want to pay the 27 and 28 thousand dollar price tags on the regular Rodeo's.  In addition, the Rodeo Sports in the hard top offered the dual sunroofs which I really liked.  I made it clear to the salesman that I had no intention of increasing my payments by some ridiculous amount and if they couldn't accommodate me I would just keep my car as I really liked it.  He assured me that they would accommodate me as it was the end of the month and they needed the sales.  So the next morning I left my car at the Isuzu dealer and he gave me Rodeo Sport to drive to work.  Having made numerous new car deals I am getting to be an old pro at it and I had no intention of getting the run around.  I must say that I didn't.
     They made me the deal I wanted, my payments increased by $9.00 but my insurance went down $30.00 a month.  It was the easiest car deal I have ever made, but partially because I knew how to make the deal that "I" wanted.  Now that we've got all that out of the way, let's discuss the Rodeo Sport.
     These vehicles are proof that other SUV's are just flat overpriced.  Way overpriced.  This particular Rodeo Sport listed at 23,195 with the following options.
205 hp 3.2L V6, two wheel drive, 6 disc in the dash CD and cassette player (6 speaker sound system) , heated side mirrors, towing package, keyless entry, dual sunroof hard top option, 4 speed automatic, premium wheels and other little extra's like the cargo net, floor mats, integrated alarm system, rear defrost, rear windshield wiper and cargo tray.  I can promise you that this list of options on a 4 Runner would easily run you 32 to 35K.
     Another young woman where I work has also recently purchased a Rodeo Sport and her chief complaint was gas mileage.  After a little investigation I discovered where she was coming from.  The fuel tank in these vehicles isn't large by any standard of measure, only 15.6 gallons.  And the V6 averages about 16 to 17 in city driving.  To complicate matters she kept her "Power" mode activated all the time.  This will surely degrade your mileage.  On the plus side it's fun to use sometimes for merging onto the interstate and such.  The 3.2, 24 valve V6 in these SUV's will really get them moving in a hurry.  But unless you just like terrible gas mileage I suggest you leave it in regular mode until you need the extra ommph.  Even then it has plenty of power.  I was hesitant at first about the "throttle by wire" technology.  Call me old school but I like to know there's a connection between the accelerator pedal and the engine.  But the computer controlled acceleration has been flawless.  I haven't noticed a difference between it and conventional throttle methods. 
     Getting into and out of the rear seat area can be a task.  I have found it is easiest to do from the passenger side as the seat there not only leans forward it also slides forward to allow a larger entry path.  Once in the back however there is ample room even for larger passengers.  The back seat leg and head room in the Rodeo Sport is easily on par with most large sedans.  A surprising fact in what outwardly appears to be a vehicle with a small interior.  Two adults can seat themselves comfortably.  A fact I can atest to as I have had friends ride in the back of mine on a road trip where they found themselves perfectly comfortable.  In fact they rather enjoyed having their own sunroof.
     Car critics, of course, all love to berate the ride quality of the Rodeo Sports, especially on road.  I'll grant you it's no Town Car but let's be realistic.  This is a true SUV on a pick-up truck frame that has ample ground clearance and a suspension that is designed to traverse rugged terrain.  You just aren't going to get a Town Car ride out of that.  But then you won't find a Town Car making it's way down an rocky trail on a weekend camping trip.  I don't mind the ride and in fact somewhat prefer it over being so secluded from the road surface that you don't really know what's going on.  But that's just me.
     The 6 disc in the dash CD / Cassette sound system is a noticeable high dollar option in a rather low priced SUV.  The sound quality is good and I have found the system easy to understand and control.  The speakers are not anything that will rock the block but frankly that's alright with me.  I am considering replacing them with Boston Acoustic speakers just to get better sound quality but I'm just to old to worry with having a sound system that can be heard 200 yards away.  The fact of the matter is there's only one real reason to have a sound system that loud and that is to have people look at you.  I have no such childish desires to be the center of attention all the time.  So long as I can get good sound quality I'm happy.
     The rear seats folds up completely against the back of the front seats allowing for 65 cubic feet of cargo room.  Granted you won't be carrying around loads of lumber but there is still enough room for large ticket items like new televisions, some bags of concrete or other things that would easily fit.
     If I ever do find myself with a need to carry larger items I can always resort to the trailer method.  The towing package allows me to tow up to 4500 pounds.  This will be useful on camping trips as I have a lot of camping equipment all of which can't be loaded into the back and still carry three of my friends.
     Overall I am very pleased with this vehicle.  It offers a great deal of features and options and suits the specific needs I have for it.  The warranty offered by Isuzu is also very impressive and played a major role in my decision to purchase this SUV.  It is covered for 36 months or 50,000 miles from bumper to bumper including some very helpful roadside assistance options.  For 10 years or 120,000 miles the engine, transmission, suspension, and axels are covered.  That's an offer you just won't get from a lot of other manufacturers.
