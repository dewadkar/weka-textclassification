            I have a Dodge Ram Van 1500.  It has been a great vehicle so far!  We bought it in April 1999 and have had only one problem that was fixed by the dealer-no questions asked.  

After we had put 6000 miles on it we noticed that the front tires were wearing down really fast.  The tires have a 50,000 mile warranty and at the rate they were wearing we estimated we would need two new tires by 10,000 miles.  We called the dealer and they said bring it on in.  They adjusted the alignment and put two new front tires on it!  They said that the alignment may have gotten messed up during delivery.  We now have put on another 6000 miles and have seen no wear on the tires and the alignment is fine!

We have owned many vans over the years, among them have been 2 chevys, a ford, and a nissan quest.  I was hesitant to buy a dodge.  I grew up hearing the saying, &quot;Buy a dodge and you will keep it in the garage&quot;. Well, I am glad we bought this van, we feel we got a good vehicle at a great price.  It is roomy and comfortable.  We have a van conversion kit put on by Imperial Starcraft.  It has four captain chairs and a bench seat in the back that converts to a bed.  We have already slept on the bed when we went on a 1 night camping trip and didn't want to set up the tent, it was a very comfortable bed.  The two captains seats swivel around and face the rear and my children use this feature to play games with each other while traveling.  

The air conditioning works great.  We have only air conditioning vents in the front and when we turn on the air full blast it has no problem cooling off the rear seats.  The temperatures where we live can reach 110 in the summer and so the air conditioner has to be really good!  

We get approximately 22 miles to the gallon--which to me is a pretty good gas mileage for such a large vehicle!!  We also have T.V. hook up-which comes in handy on trips.  Our family of 6 fits in this vehicle comfortably, along with all of our stuff when we go to California on vacation!  We are not disappointed in this van!<br><br>
