            As the mother of two small children, and the owner of a daycare, I needed more passenger space, so we after much debate we traded in our Ford Contour for a 1997 Astro.  We have been for the most part delighted.  One of the nicest features is that it seats eight, with two full benches in the back, an option not available in all mini-vans.  Although it has only one sliding door, rather than two I felt it was worth an occassional inconvenience for the $2000 that saved us!  My complaints are that it drives like a truck, rather than more like a car like other minivans we have driven have.  It corners roughly and groceries fly all over the place.  We are remedying that with a simple cargo net to attach in the back.  A simple solution to a rather annoying problem.  I also miss Ford's cruise controls on the steering wheel.  The Astro has handled well on ice, and while we have been told the advantage of a &quot;truck&quot; frame is towing capacity, we have not yet used it for towing, so can not comment on that capability.  The seats are heavy and awkward, but not too difficult to move.  My husband has done it alone when necessary.  The rear sliding seat is wonderful and makes it unnecessary to remove the seat at all in many instances.  Since purchasing our Astro we have had no mechanical problems or quirks whatsoever -- in spite of buying a used vehicle!  I strongly recommend the Astro for anyone looking for dependability and room for passengers and cargo, but not for someone looking for a comfortable, luxury ride.  <br><br>
