            Young and powerful, rich and protected by his henchmen, he was picked by his father to succeed him.  He then became one of the major dictators of Latin American.  Papa Doc anointed Baby Doc as the leader of one of the poorest countries in the Western hemisphere, Haiti.  Yet, despite being the leader of such a poor country, Baby Doc who lost power in 1986 and has since resided in France led what is called the life of the rich and powerful.  For hours, I was stuck on the outskirt of the Haitian capital, in an area named Carrefour because the dictator was on his way to an inauguration in the southern part of the country.  As I watched the defile, I could not stop shaking my head and being surprised by the number of European imports including Land Rovers passing by.  

No wonder I was late to my meeting with a CARE representative.  He often complained about how much pressure he was under by the establishment.  A lot of the Tonton Macoutes did not like the NGOs.  They could not get their cut from the millions of dollars that were earmarked for development projects.  Efforts by other NGOs and private citizens to electrify communities were often met with resistence by community leaders who hoped to be bribed.  

<b>Originally designed for farm use:  Land Rover gets hip and is used by the in-crowd</b>

The Land Rover has outlived its modest beginnings.  For a long time now, it has been used to show class and refinements.  I once had a neighbor who bought a Land Rover.  I told him that this vehicle was initially designed for farmers.  He could not believe my stories.  In fact, the 1948 Land Rover Series I (or Defender) came with permanent four-wheel drive and a canvas roof and with no doors as an option.  But the Land Rover corporation has long shed this image in that they wanted to build SUVs with a world-wide appeal.  Everybody knows that if you want a well-designed, reliable, off-road vehicle, you have to pick a Land Rover.  Maybe Baby Doc did not want to get hurt in case of an accident!

<b>Rugged and Multipurpose:  Land Rover Series I Changed to Series II</b>

<i>An SUV with an attitude</i>

Built to handle all kinds of road conditions, the Land Rover designers did not care much about comfort in the beginning, but all of this was going to change in 1958 with the Series II.  To make a better impression on the world market, refinements were added.  

<b>The 2001 Land Rover Discovery Series II benefits from all the engineering redesigns and features</b>

There is no doubt that the Discovery Series II is well-designed.  It still keeps the boxy image though.  It comes with a metal hartop roof.  The Discovery was introduced in 1989.  It is powered by a V-8 engine that somewhat makes it look heavy.  It's available in all models.  It also offers a lot of options.  Clearly, this Discovery Series II is not the same vehicle.  

<b>Some of the features that you should expect to find</b>

*  Alpine Sound System
*  Leather seating
*  Active Cornering Enhancement
*  Hill Descent Control (HDC) which uses the brakes as well as the engine's natural braking to help slow the SUV

*  Hill Descent automatically controls the amount of pressure and keeps the vehicle from moving unnecessarily.

*  Permanent four-wheel drive, strong coil springs and axles.

For many including me, the Land Rover is a classic.  The Discovery has its own attitude.  It shows pride and class.
