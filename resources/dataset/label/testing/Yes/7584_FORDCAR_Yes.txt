            My husband bought my Expedition for me after looking at one on a car lot. I loved the look of it and the fact that it is built on a Ford chassis, which I feel would be safer all around.  It drives like a dream!  I have a handicapped daughter who uses a wheelchair at times so the room comes in handy. I could take the back seat out, but prefer not to.  I do however, wish that there was a bit more room behind the back seat for other things. I love the fact that it seats 9 people and my gas mileage is just as good as any other mid sized car. I do not feel that anyone that has trouble getting into higher vehicles buy the Expedition since it does sit quite high. Surely gives you an advantage for seeing what is in front of you. I would buy another one to match if I could afford it! <br><br>
