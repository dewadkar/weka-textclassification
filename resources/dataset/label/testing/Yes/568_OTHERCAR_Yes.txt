            I purchased my 2000Accent GSI. What I like about it... It's sporty looking, I have the sunroof and rear spoiler and low profile tires. It was much cheaper than the Honda and Toyota equivalent. It has fairly good gas mileage, but I expected better from a smaller engine. It seems that if you do much city driving it really seems to affect the gas mileage, more than I thought it should. It is nice and quiet on the highway and interior looks good and it is also roomier than other smaller vehicles in it's category. Who should not buy this car....people who live around mountains or large hills, it is completely gutless when it comes to climbing. Took it on a road trip and had to go through a mountain pass and we had to drop it into 3rd gear in some cases and really raise the rev's in order to keep a decent speed. It handles and corners like a dream though, we took it on some curvy roads and that is where it really made a big impression on us, you stayed in your seat, you didn't feel like you were going to be pitched out of the seat even on some of the sharper corners. Overall I am very pleased with the car, I enjoy driving it, it's comfortable even on those long drives. I have had a someone 6ft tall drive the car on a 3 hr drive and he found it very comfortable as well, good head clearance without adjusting the seat any. <br><br>
