            when i first began to look at a vehicle to lease i fell immediately in love with the 2000 4-runner.  it was a great looking car that was stylish for a young teenager like myself.  so finally, we went to the dealer and picked out the features that i wanted in my 4-runner which included the sports package and all that other nonsense.  in fact the 4-runner that i chose was an sr5 model fully loaded.  it was a gorgeous car.  so finally i headed to the finance table and was with a 613$ a month payment no money down.  going through toyota motor credit was the biggest hassle.  anyway when i walked out of the toyota dealer i went across the street to the gmc dealer.  the minute that i laid eyes on the gmc 2000 i loved it.  i loved it because it was big, sturdy, great lookin, and had a great body style.  when i stepped into the vehicle i fell even more in love it.  it had features such as onstar, heated seats, leather, spacious room, puddle lights, big engine, and a long list of great standard features.  so i ask the salesman how much a month on a 36-month lease no money down.  he says to me 529$ a month.  i said what!  for about a 100$ less i was going to get more standard features and a bigger vehicle at the same time.  i'll take it.  the new gmc 2000 yukon offers more standard features that any other suv.  the 4-runner that i was supposedly going to get didn't have a quarter of as many features as the new yukon did.  so by buying the 4-runner i was really getting less features for more money.  i recommend the new gmc yukon to everyone.<br><br>
