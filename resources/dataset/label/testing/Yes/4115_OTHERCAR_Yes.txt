            We love our 1998 Pathfinder.  It handles well in all road conditions.

We chose this car for two reasons.  First, we had a baby on the way and wanted something besides a mini-van and second, we wanted a vehicle that could handle well in snow and ice for our weekend ski trips.

We have nearly 30k miles and have not had a single problem.  There is enough of room for four adults and a baby car seat.  The interior is practical and comfortable. The exterior is appealing as well. It gets pretty good gas mileage, 18 miles-city, for a suv.  It also has some &quot;get-up and go&quot; to it.  When we were test driving other suv's this one felt like it had good power compared to others.

This vehicle is great for those of you who enjoy outdoor activities, like camping, skiing, hiking, etc. and it works quite well for family vacations and outings.  There is quite a bit of room behind the backseat for your luggage and packages!

We felt that the price (we got an awesome price on this one) was unbeatable by any other make of suv.
