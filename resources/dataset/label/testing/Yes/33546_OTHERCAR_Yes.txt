            I bought this car from my friend who took really good care of it for years.
It was about three and half years ago.

I don't want to say any negative about this car because I loved it all the way.  But it got to the point that I just had to let it go before it breaks me.

A few months after the purchase, the transmission completely went out on me.  I took it to the shop and spent $ 1,700.00 for the brand new transmission.  Starting with transmission problems, I had various problems for the whole time I was driving it.  I told myself " it's old car.  It costs to keep it on the road. " I was in denial. I didn't really care.  BMW 528 1985 was my favorite model for the longest time, I was just happy to drive it.  There wasn't one scratch, interior looked really good when I bought it.  

I can't remember how many times I put this bad boy in the shop and how much money I spent on it total.  It was like  having big car payments every three months even though I purchased it in cash.

As you know, the auto parts for old cars can be expensive.  I spent average $600 every time I put it in the shop.  I remember it constantly had " IDLE " problem.  When it's very cold or very hot outside, car stopped right after I started car.  In the summer time, it stopped in the middle of the street because I had A/C on.  I learned to listen to  this car by driving it for years.  The car started to tell me " I am about to stop on you! "  So I knew what not to do this car to keep it driving.

It also stopped in the middle of the road after it made really loud noise. It was some pump collapsed inside.  That was embarrassing!  

I can go on about the problems with this car but let's not go there.  I let the car go and bought Z3 instead.  I heard that a mechanic at BMW dealership bought this car.  So it's in the good hand now but I feel for him.  I hope he gets good employee discount at the shop.
