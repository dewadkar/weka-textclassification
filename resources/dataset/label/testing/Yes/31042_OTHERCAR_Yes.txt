            I recently traded in my 1994 Infiniti Q45 and purchased a 1998 Infiniti I30t.  I really liked the Q45 but my wife kept stating the obvious: that the car is awful on wet or snowy surfaces.  I wanted to get the most car for my money.  And by &quot;most&quot; I mean a combination of factors: Luxury, performance, power, safety, and lastly, but certainly not least, looks.  
I will admit that I am taken in by a car's aesthetics.  So with these parameters I set out to find a suitable replacement for the Q45.  Unfortunately the only car that would satisfy *every* criteria is the Audi A8 but at the time of this writing, even the 1997 A8 still commands a price tag in the low 30's.  So I had to eliminate this car.
My next option would then be an A6.  I test drove a 1996 and a 1998 A6.  Both handled like dreams.  They also looked great (especially the 1998).  However, going from the mega-powerful Q45 to the meekly powered A6 was too dramatic a power loss.  Also the 1998 A6 exhibited substantial wind noise on the highway (I hate that).  Just as a side note, the 2001 A6's have been redesigned with considerably more powerful engines (and a hefty 50k price tag!).  
I came dangerously close to buying a Mazda Millennia.  I found a new one at a fantastic price (as they say, &quot;you can't give these cars away&quot;) And as far as looks go, hands down, the Millennia is the winner.  It is a uniquely styled car and has flair to spare (hey that rhymes).  But (isn't there always a &quot;but&quot;) it felt like I was driving a 4 cylinder.  Not much power. A little punch, but it left me merging cautiously onto the highway.  So in my price range I was still searching for other options when I stopped in at the local Infiniti dealership.  I was looking for something on their used car lot when I came across a 1998 I30.  The price was right and I had driven I30's as loaners when the Q45 was sick, so I started seriously considering the I30.  

Power: Very good. Not amazing, but strong enough to satisfy the power appetites of most people (I'm still a bit spoiled by the Q45).  The I30 has roughly the same proven V6 as the Maxima, and is nearly impossible to fault.

Luxury: Very much so.  This is *not* a Maxima - trust me, the insides of these cars are worlds apart as far as look and feel is concerned.  Also, the ride of the I30 is �heavier�.  It seems as though the car weighs more than it does - a true feeling of luxury.  

My only complaint is that the cockpit leaves both my legs resting against fairly hard plastic moldings.  And compared to my Q45, it is a bit cramped up front, such as trying to get something out of the center console - I practically have to pull over, stop the car, get out and climb in through the back seat to get in there. But in the grand scheme of things that's a minor complaint.  One other note on the interior is that the I30 has an enormous trunk.  Not that I need it, but it's impressive.  The larger trunk may explain why there seems to be almost no rear legroom.  Well, I don't ride in the back so it's not really a complaint as much as it is an observation.

Performance: The I30t handles quite well for a non-sports car.  I have yet to experience and noticeable body roll in hard turns. 

And finally looks: Well, the I30 is not an ugly car but it is rather plain.  I think the newer models (2000+) have a more distinctive appearance.  They look less like their Maxima counterparts and more like their own selves.  Nonetheless, the 1998 I30 is no ugly duckling.  In fact, the touring edition is, dare I say, sporty-looking.

The Bose stereo in the car is awesome.  Anyone who tells you different is probably a snobby audiophile, because for the average person, and even those who appreciate GREAT sounding mobile audio, this system will knock your socks off.  
Another aspect I like about the car is the layout of the dashboard.  It does not look cheap in any way.  I found the Millennia�s dash a bit flimsy, but not nearly as much as some of the SUV's I test-drove (what a joke!)

I should mention the brakes. My car has brand new brakes and I do not think they are adequate for the car.  I mean, they stop the car, don't get me wrong, but I would like stronger brakes.  You can't put a price on driver-confidence, and having brakes that you can trust is crucial.

In summary, the 1998 I30 represents the most car for the money.  Again, if you are looking for a car that wins in one category only, then there are other cars you should consider.  But, if what you are looking for is a car that scores well in every category, for about 18 to 20k, then you need to check out the I30. Get the touring edition if possible.  It not only has an attractive rear spoiler and better looking wheels, but a sport-tuned suspension and other enhancements that give it &quot;driver appeal&quot;
