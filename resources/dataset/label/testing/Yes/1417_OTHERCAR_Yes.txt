            In the summer of 1998, I bought a new Dodge Neon RT 4 door sedan.  You know the one that looks like Herbie the Love Bug because of the factory racing stripes.

The car is a pleasure to drive.  The 5 speed stick (no automatic option) shifts crisply and the 2.0 16 valve DOHC engine gives you a fun 150 horses to play with.  This car will MOVE if you ask it to.  Car and Driver got one to do 0-60 in 7.6 seconds.

The RT also comes standard with a sportier suspension, Goodyear Eagle HR speed rated tires, beautiful 14&quot; cast aluminum wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, and special quick ratio steering.

I also opted for the comfort options like power mirrors, windows, locks, sunroof and trunk mounted CD changer.  If I cared about weight or wanted to race I would have gotten the ACR model instead - which comes basically stripped.  I also didn't opt for the ABS because the 4 wheel discs are quick sure stoppers.

The car is visually very appealing.  The old style Neon (pre-1999) is just cuter than the redesign.  Add in the racing stripes and the body color door handles and bumpers and this is one great looking little car.  You could delete the stripes as a factory option to get a sleeper - but the car is so great looking with them - who would bother.

I have had only a few minor problems (I am a real stickler) with the car and all have been fixed under warranty.

They have not yet announced plans to market another Neon R/T, so your only option is to find a fool willing to part with one.<br><br>
