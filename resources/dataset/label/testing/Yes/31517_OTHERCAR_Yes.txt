            Nissan has reinvented the Sentra, and quite possibly made a name for yet another one of it's vehicles.

The Sentra used to be a compact car (pre-2000) sporting a nifty little 1.6 liter, 16 valve engine. This year however, Nissan decided to up the stakes and turned this compact economy car into a mid sized car and 2.0 liter engine.

I took a trip down to the Car Show at the Bayside Expo Center in Boston last weekend, so my brother in law and I could take a peek at the new Nissan models, and lo and behold, she was there. 

The sentra was sporting a back tailight wing, custom spoiler, auto retractable sun roof, leather interior options, smoky gray exterior, and the snazziest carbon fiber kit on the inside trim you could ever imagine.

I was impressed.

We went up to a dealer in NH and took a test drive of the Sentra SE the next day. It handles like a Honda Accord, the sound isolation is great, no more highway screaming under your tires, and the acceleration is a tad more then decent, for a mid size of course.

It's a great family car, or even a college kids' car.

I love it, and I'm buying one in a few weeks.
