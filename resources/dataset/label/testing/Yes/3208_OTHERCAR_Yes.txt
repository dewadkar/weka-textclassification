            To set the expectation, I am not a professional photographer.  I purchased this camera for general picture taking, but wanted the ability to experiment if I choose to get more into photography.  After much deliberation, I landed upon the Sony Cybershot.

This camera was first caught my attention for two reasons.  First, I like a camera that I can get my hands around.  Many of the digital cameras are very small and difficult to hold without putting a finger over the lens, flash or view finder.  You will not have any of these problems with this camera.  Second, the battery is compatible with my Sony Camcorder.  For most, this is not a big deal, but it is sure convenient to have an extra battery lying around just in case.

The battery life on this camera is very good.  Depending upon whether you use the viewfinder or LCD screen you could expect to get at least a couple hours of use on the battery (if not more).  The one item that must be upgraded immediately is the memory stick.  The memory stick provided is only 16 Meg, which is good for about 15 pictures at the 1600 x 1200 resolution.  If shooting in the TIF mode, expect to get about 5 pictures on the 16 Meg card.  Fortunately, there are more manufacturers now offering memory sticks, and the size ranges from 16 Meg to 256 Meg or more.

The operation of the camera is very intuitive if you just want to take snap shots.  Just turn on the camera, but make sure you have the dial set appropriately.  I had trouble at first because you are supposed to line up the icons on the dial to change the settings.  My problem at first was there are no indicators by which to line up these icons.  Here is a hint, line up the desired icon so it faces the left side of the camera.  Then you can shoot away.

There are many options available on this camera.  You can date stamp, use red eye flash, change white balance, take movies, change resolutions, zoom (3x optical) and much more.  All the necessary cables and software are provided if you want to download pictures to a computer.  

Some complaints I have are:
The white balance settings are limited to 3 automatic settings and there is a custom setting.  It is easy to use the LCD to maneuver and manipulate the pictures once taken.  One thing that would have been nice is an automatic lens cover.   You must manually remove the lens cover; at least it is on a strap so it won&#146t be lost.  Additionally, there is at least a 2 second delay after taking a picture before you can take another.  Some other cameras have better frame per second performance.

Other than these few complaints, I am very happy with this camera.  In the macro mode you can get within an inch of the subject, it is really quite amazing.  The picture/color quality is terrific.  I have had very few blurred or out of focus pictures, which were user error when I did have them.  If you are like me, just want to play around and take pictures that look great, then this is camera is one that will do it.  It is easy to use so you don&#146t have to be hampered by all the manual settings (unless you want to play around with them).

It has now been eight months, and I have not had any problems with this camera, nor has my wife.    Now that is a real accomplishment!

I would recommend this camera to anyone.
