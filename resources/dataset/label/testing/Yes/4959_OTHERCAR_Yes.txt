            I decided to buy the CoolPix 4300 for myself as a birthday gift after reading many of the reviews on this site.  The Nikon appeared to have all the features I wanted, and a great price.  This review focuses on my view of the camera, rather than a more technical aspect.

I love photography, and in addition to my CoolPix I have a Nokin point and shoot, and a Nikon SLR.  No, im not a nikon finnatic, but, so far, their cameras have always given me exactly what I want.  

I was looking for a camera that had basic functions, but also more advanced manual settings so I could grow in the digial world.  

<b> The 4300 has a few key features that I would like to highlight. (and the scenarios that they work well in) </b>


<b> CloseUp  </b>
The 4300 takes amazing closeup images.  The day after I bought the camera I took it to the local butterfly farm. I played around with different modes, but was unable to come up with sucessful pictures.  I had not learnt to adjust to the shutter lag or focus.  

After I had had the camera for about 2 months I took it on a tour of my garden to see what I could find. By this time, I had learnt how to use most of its functions.  On still images (flowers, ect) the quality is amazing.  I produces larger-than-life images that had great detail, and true to life colour.  
After my great flower experiences I searched for something for a little harder to shoot.  funny how every living creature seemed to disappear.  I found a small lizzard and moved in for the kill.  I took about 5 pictures, all with different focus areas.
About half of these pictures were succesful, the other half were focused on areas I did not want.  (the camera keeps all the information of each shot, including the focus area, and after review, theese were all true to life. It was my mistake focusing on the tree branch instead of the lizzards foot!)

<b> Lightning  </b>
I managed to take some great pictures of lightning.  You can open the shutter up to 1 minute.  However, times above 12 secconds gave too much white noise.  (there was very little light polution)
The camera can not jump back fast enough to capture all the shows of light.  It takes as long to write the data as it takes to make the shot.  
Still, I was most impressed. 

<b> Parties  </b>  
I have shot a few memory cards worth at childrens parties.  The shutter lag is a bit too slow for fast action shots of children, but if you take a little extra time to compose your picture you will be successful.  The battery lasts about as long as one childs birthday party... but keep a spare if it is a nighttime party...  the flash drains the battery.

<b> Accessories  </b>
The nikon can take a few lenses made for the coolPix range.  However, these lenses are a little hard to come by.  
I just got good news, I can get an underwater housing made for my camera from fantaseas line.  I plan to get it soon, and will write more about it.  I have seen pictures taken with it they are amazing!  even without an additional strobe.
