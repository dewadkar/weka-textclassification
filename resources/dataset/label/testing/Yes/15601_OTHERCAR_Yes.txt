            But then, I'm no real camera expert. Usually when you get beyond the Polaroid One-Step, I'm lost! And forget about all those fancy 35mm thingys! I'm totally lost then!!  But when it comes to digitals, I've learned a bit. I never have been one for taking/sending film in to be developed. I've had 2 previous digital cameras, a Casio QV-11 was my first and it was a good little camera. Then I got a Kodak DC-280 and was reasonable happy with that, except for the macro function. I need some pretty close shots now and then and it just didn't get it. This one, the Sony FD-91, has a 14x Zoom and gets down real tight!!  It's a little more complicated than some other digitals, but if you set it up right, then you can't beat it! When I first started looking at it, I wasn't too sure about it. A bit pricy for my budget at the time ($999). I was in a store and asked for a demo of it and the clerk was very obliging and actually knew what he was doing!! (I was REALLY impressed by that!) Took a couple of shots, one of which was of my face. Then took out the floppy and inserted it into his PC and brought up his image editor... Jeez! I couldn't believe it! He took it up to 200% and you could count the individual hairs in my beard!! That's getting pretty close up! At any rate, I bought it and have not regretted it at all. I build web pages and take a lot of outdoor scenic shots for that, as well as indoor shots. I also take a few close up shots of various plants for a book I'm writing and it gets me some very nice detail shots of plants in various stages of development. It also has an MPEG function. You can take short little movies with it. (about 5 secs or so.) It's a little complicated, at least for me, to set up, but worth the effort. One REALLY great point is the fact that it has no individual software to install. It uses floppy disks and you can get about 20 shots on a disk at &quot;fine&quot; resolution. Take the floppy disk and open it in any image editor (uses jpeg format). You don't have to wait for any special software to download it. Love that! Pricewise, the $999 price is average retail... I beat it by almost $200 using shopping services on the Internet. I paid $810 for mine so that put it more in my price category.  <br><br>
