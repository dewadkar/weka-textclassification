            I began to think about an SUV when my car began to fade away slowly--nickel and dime-ing my budget every month.  My sister has an Explorer--so does my brother.  My brother -in law drives a Blazer.  I got all kinds of opinions on the &quot;best&quot; vehicle to buy in the SUV category.  I read every auto book and magazine in an effort to make a qualified decision.

When I drove around, I really liked the look of the Jeep Wrangler.  It has classic lines and a long history.  Although the reviews on the Jeep Wrangler were somewhat mixed, the resale value maintained a consistently high rate in all the publications I read.  I also asked Wrangler drivers if they liked their vehicle and would they buy one again--all responses were in the affirmative.

I purchased a new Wrangler (1999) with a hard and soft top. The hard top provides good protection against the winter cold.  The soft top is great in warm weather.  However, it is not the easiest thing to put together.  Once you learn how to operate the soft top, it gets easier every time.
