            With the entire hassle of getting pictures developed, and then having to scan them to get the image onto my computer, I decided that I had had enough. With my limited funds, I decided to buy the Sony DSC-P20 for $200, and overall it has been a great deal for the money.

The camera iteslf is a 1.3 mega-pixel camera that can produce images areound 1280x960. With the memory stick you are supplied with (4 meg), you can take about 5 pictures under that resolution. I recommend getting a larger card. I have a 32 Meg card and it works fine. 55 high res pictures, or up to 380 low resolution pics, and it is easy to delete the ones you don't want, even with just the camera.

The 3X Digital zoom is an okay feature that you probably never use. Rather than using a lens to bring the image closer, the camera takes the image and zooms into to, creating pixelated images when you use the zoom. The DSC-P30 for $50 does include an optical zoom, which may bee more to your liking if you want closer pictures.

There is also a movie maker option mode. You can either take mpegs (only limited by the storage of your card), or create gif animations with your pics. Its a nice feature, but you get no sound, so it's usefullness isn't that high. The movies have a hard time recording in low to medium light situatuions, so be sure to take them outside.

This brings up one important limitation. The flash works for only a few feet in low light, so don't take a picture from far away (such as a stage) and hope to get good shots. You need to be close, and even closer due to the lack of optical zoom. The flash tends to make things look a little bright if too close, so it's best to experiment to find your ideal situation.

Other features include things like night shot (which produces blurry images without a tripod), picture efects (neg art, solarize, etc..), email and tiff modes, and a few other things that are not really all that much of features such as the ability to change exposure and sharpness.

The 1.5 inch LCD screen is extremely sharp. It performs much better than some more expensive cameras I've seen. Taking a picture using the screen is easy to do, except in low light, were the screen is hard to see.

Please buy the rechargable battery and save yourself some trouble later. Batteries last a day at most in this camera due to the high res screen, and the battery last a few times longer, and recharges, and the best feature of the rechargeable battery is that it is an infolithum, so it will tell you how much time you have left.

Overall, if you are looking for an entry level camera, this is it. There are few frills, but the camera itself works well and is a steal for the price.
