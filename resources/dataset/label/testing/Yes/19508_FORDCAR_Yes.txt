            I drove a 2001 Ford Mustang on a wet day and it handled like a dream.  I did not drive the Mustang GT which has a 4.6 liter SOHC V8 engine with 260 horsepower but the
Mustang I did drive had plenty of power.  

I drove a beautifully styled Silver Mustang that had a 3.8 Liter EFI V6 engine with 190 horses.  I drove an automatic although the car comes standard with a 5-speed manual
transmission.  The automatic transmission was very responsive and the car had great acceleration.

The car is, of course, for a family of two unless the family has very small children.  I am tall and had no problem in the front seats but would have had to sit with my knees to my chin in the back.  But this is a sports car, not a family car.

The gas mileage is adequate considering the power of the engines at 19 in town and 27 on the road and it has a fairly large fuel tank for a small car (15.7 gall.).

The model I drove comes standard with air conditioning which works very well.  It also had power brakes, windows, door locks and steering.  It has a tachometer, voltmeter, and temperature.

Again, back to the seats, the car had cloth sport bucket seats in front which were very comfortable and gave easy access to all necessary items on the front panel.

The visibility of the car is excellent with large windows and electric side mirrors.

The car also came standard with stereo CD, radio and cassette and the sound system was great

As for safety features, the car comes with the standard driver and front passenger airbags, and SecurLock passive anti-theft system.

One of the greatest features of the Mustang to me is its looks.  The 2001 model is sleek and just begs you to drive it.  It comes in yellow, green (two shades), black, silver, laser red and performance red, true blue and Oxford white.

But above everything else is the actual driving pleasure I received from the car.  It was responsive to my commands, handled extremely well in heavy traffic, and took turns with
no problems at all.  When Ford introduced the Mustang in the 60's, it was revolutionary. I feel the quality of the car slipped from the mid-70's to the '90's but I feel that the Mustang is back and roaring.

The price (before negotiation) of the heavily equipped car I drove was a reasonable $18000.  For the small family or for anyone that still likes to have fun driving, this is the
car for you.
