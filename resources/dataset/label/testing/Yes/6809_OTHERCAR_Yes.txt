            I own a 2000 Subaru Legacy GT after owning a 1990 Legacy Sedan and a 92 Legacy Turbo.I think the Subaru's are a real gem! Most reliable AWD
recommend to anyone where snow/ice are hazards!
I still own a 1990 Legacy L sedan now with over 220,000Km (about 130,000M)
I am having some trouble with the transmission but it has been a real nice car, very reliable in particular with the conditions we get here on Winter time. I feel very safe in those cars they have never left me stranded. If you keep up with the recommended maintenance program they seem to perform very well, also on the &quot;faint praise&quot; category as there are not too many of those cars I don't really worry about it being stolen.
My wishes were mainly now met by my new 2000 GT except maybe for a V6 motor (at a reasonable price)
