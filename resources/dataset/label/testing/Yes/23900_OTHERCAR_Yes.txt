            I loved the look of the TT at first sight. The lines are exceptionally clean, and it's one of the only cars I've ever seen which could be said to have a unifying theme.  The TT is a collection of circles within circles within circles, from the endlessly curvy exterior to the spare and elegant instrument panel to the aluminum ring (which looks as though it might have been borrowed from a jet plane) surrounding the boot of the stick shift.

The interior might have been designed by a Zen monk.  There's nothing but the essentials, but those essentials are executed with such thoughtful design sense that almost every aspect of this automobile is a pleasure.  Circular air vents are surrounded by circular bezels of brushed aluminum, which--surprise!--are actually functional: twist one clockwise, and it progressively closes down the vent it surrounds.

The simplicity of the appearance belies the technology incorporated into this thoroughly modern machine. The center of the control panel, in the midst of those very retro-feeling gauges, is a computer-controlled, multicolor LED panel, which can display a variety of information. The car has a driving computer which calculates your probably remaining mileage, average mileage, driving time, and average speed.

The elegance of the execution is likewise remarkable. The seats and door panels are leather and very comfortable. The seats can be raised and lowered (not as neatly as the New Beetle's, though--why should that be?), the steering wheel both adjusts up and down, and also telescopes in and out.

The Bose sound system is terrific. The six-speaker setup includes radio, cassette and 6-disk CD changer, all controllable via an easily reachable control panel. There are probably too many buttons on the panel, but they're reasonably laid out for the most part. Bose could probably improve the human interface here, but it doesn't affect the sound.

The rear seat is not quite the joke it appears at first glance. It is, in fact, possible to have small children back there in tolerable comfort, but forget it if they're over 4' 11&quot;: the roof slopes too much.  In its defense, it brings the insurance costs down, serves as a decent place to park your belongings (although they'll fly all over the place when you get to driving it, if you enjoy driving even the tiniest bit). Audi admits the size limitation to the point of putting a sticker on the door pillar.  Fair's fair.

On the road, the TT is sure footed and fleet.  The 180 hp engine responds with assurance to the slightest touch on the accelerator. The brakes are, if anything, a little touchier than one might expect at first, but they are easy to get used to and, with disks all around and ABS, have exceptional stopping power. The gearbox is very smooth, and the shift has a nice short throw, enabling the driver the move through the gears with confidence.

I've test driven the TT on several of the more challenging roads here in the Bay Area (Niles Canyon Road and Highway 9, if you know the area), and it moves like a slot car around the turns. It's a thorough pleasure to drive.

There's a pretty good sized storage space under the hatchback, and the rear seats fold down, in theory at least. I suspect that you can either have someone sit in the front, or fold down the rear seat, but not both.
Gas mileage seems reasonable for a car of this kind, and I expect I'll be able to drive at a more-or-less equal cost to my previous car (a RAV/4) even though the TT insists on the expensive stuff (91 octane or better) at the pump.

This is not a cheap car, and it's been in high demand. Dealers will quote prices above MSRP and get it. The recent stock market fun has probably had an impact on sales of these babies, so if you have the dough and you're inclined, it's not a bad time to try to negotiate a deal. You'll probably have to get a factory tester with a few thousand miles on the clock unless you want to wait a year to get one on order.
