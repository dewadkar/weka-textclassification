            <b>Introduction</b>
When the Durango first appeared on the scene, it was one of the few <i>new</i> (as in post-1968) vehicles I admitted a "lust" for.  Face it, in a sea of SUV's that more or less look the same, it stands out.  It shares the lines of the Ram, and pays tribute to the drastic 90's re-design of the full-size Dodge pickup line (another of my objects of lust).  I was in the market for one in 2000, but decided otherwise as I was leaving Alaska temporarily (very sad) and no longer had a legitimate need for a 4WD family vehicle (in itself is a sad thing).  I've had opportunities to drive 4WD Durangos since their introduction, and recently rented a 2WD model for several weeks.  I have come to the conclusion that, had I bought that Durango 3 years ago, I would have been unhappy.

<b>So... what's up with your title?</b>
The F-16 rolled out in the mid 70's and since then has been proven to be a jet that can do just about everything, but not as well as other jets.  It can drop bombs... but not as many or as well as an F-15E.  It can do air-to-air... but it's not an F-15C.  It can do Close Air Support, but it's no match for the A-10.  In short, it's a "Jack of all trades, master of none."

The Durango is similar, in that it can do a lot of things, just not that well.  If you're thinking of buying one, first think about what you need this vehicle for.

<i>Lots of room</i> - get a minivan or a full-size SUV.  Yes, the Durango has more room than most of the compact SUVs (4Runner, Explorer, Jimmy), but billing it as an 8-passenger vehicle is just not honest - it's really a 6 passenger vehicle (4 adults, 2 kids).  First of all, the 3rd-row seat is a bit too narrow to hold 3.  3 adults?  No way.  You can get 2 adults back there, but in addition to having little shoulder room, the seat length is short, and on an adult is like sitting on the edge of your seat.  Legroom is extremely limited, even for elementary-aged kids.  By the way, ordering the 3rd row seat means that the 2nd row seat is re-positioned to take a couple inches of legroom from them as well.   3 kids?  Probably not (especially since many states are moving towards car/booster-seat requirements for kids all the way to 8yrs/80 lbs).  A big family with a Durango may be able to fit 2 car seats or kids in boosters in the back, another in one of the 2nd row seats (not in both - you won't be able to get to the rear seat in that case), and then one teen in the other 2nd row seat - a third in the center in a pinch.

<i>4-wheeling</i> - Define "4-wheeling."  If it's for what 95% of those who say they need a 4WD vehicle for (driving in shallow or plowed snow/ice), the Durango's fine, but so is a 2WD or AWD minivan.  If you're thinking a real need for 4WD - off-roading, that is - the Durango might not be what you're looking for - you'll do better with Toyota, Nissan, or full-sized US SUV.  

A lot has been said in printed and e-pinions reviews of the Durango of the absence of tow hooks.  Realistically, tow hooks are nice and mighty useful at times, but if you are planning to mount a winch anyhow, you'll have some sort of attachment to clip in with your winch cable.  If you're not planning on mounting a winch, you're counting on others (with winches) to pull you out of holes.  In that case, you can probably make do by looping the cable around the bumper supports of your Ford Festiva and save a wad of cash.  

More important is the lower ground clearance of the Durango (a good 2" or so less than the 4Runner) and poor approach/departure slope ability.  If you get the ground-effects/running board package like most people do, it's even worse.

Even more important is the lack of a "4WD-Low" Range in the transfer case.

Note that the Dodge website states that the new, redesigned, 2004 Durango will address both of these problems.

<i>Highway cruising</i> - again, the minivan is the choice here, with the Excursion/Suburban next on the list.  The Durango is built to drive somewhat (but not quite) like a truck, and rides a bit rougher than you might want for extended straight-line hauls.  Plus, at 15mpg (my average on 75% highway, 25% city driving with the standard 4.7L Magnum V8 2WD), you're not doing significantly better than a full-sized SUV, and you're well below even the larger minivans.

<i>Luggage/Cargo Hauling</i> - Get an extended-cab pickup, full-sized SUV, or minivan.  The Durango is rated to carry up to 1660 lbs of cargo (including passengers).  My question is, other than by carrying bricks or water, how do you get that much weight into it?  Although with the seats folded down, you're looking at more room than any of the compact SUV's, there's just not much room for cargo.  It fails the "can I put a 4x8 sheet of plywood in flat" test, and also fails my "can I fit my <a href="/content_91887079044">Santana Tandem</a> in without disassembling it" test.  With the 3rd row seats up, you have less room for luggage than most full-sized sedans.  By the way, the new 2004 Durango will have a 48.4" cargo width.

<i>Towing</i> - Here's the Durango's strong suit.  You can set it up to tow up to 10,500 lbs (a net of about 6K after deducting the weight of the vehicle itself).  That's impressive.  And with the available 5.9L V8, you're not talking about just wheezing along with that load.  Here's the one nitch I can find for the Durango - a family who needs comfortable seating for 4, occasional seating for 6, a reasonable cargo hold, and has a good-sized boat or camper to haul on trips.

<b>YEAH, YEAH, YEAH...</b>
Of course, there's a lot more Durangos being sold than families that match the above description, so obviously a lot of people buy one because... heck, it's sexy.  And I left out the other reason so many people buy them.  It's not a minivan (which really would fit most family's purposes better, but would mean tucking another part of their youth and ego in a corner).  So here's a quick review on what to expect...

<i>Ergonomics/Comfort</i>
The higher lines are comfortable enough, but the base SXT I have the most experience in leaves a lot to be desired in the driver's seat area.  Not much adjustability or support.  The controls themselves are comfortable and well-laid out for the most part, with tilt-steering optional.  The instrument cluster is clear and well-spaced, but the gear indicator and odometer are placed in the lowest extremities and were obscured by the steering wheel when I had it adjusted to my favorite spot.  A notable exception to the logical layout is the rear-window wiper/washer control.  I defy a non-Dodge driver to find it in less than 30 seconds (tucked next to the air conditioning controls).  Visibility for the driver is OK, but somewhat obstructed in the 11 and 1:30 positions by the A-pillar.  Visibility for passengers is better than some due to the "stadium seating," although I wonder if this raises the center-of-gravity unnecessarily for a fully-loaded Durango.  Visibility to the sides and rear is fair, as in most SUVs.  The power mirrors are generously-sized, though I'd prefer them to be bigger.

<i>Loading/unloading</i>
The lower ground clearance (almost car-like in the 2WD) means it's relativly easy to mount/dismount into the 1st and 2nd-row seats.  A passenger-assist handle is available for both front seats, but not in the 2nd or 3rd row.  Getting into the 3rd row is for the young and flexible, and loading a carseat back there is asking for a trip to the chiropractor, although folding and tumbling one of the 2nd-row seats (which have a useful 40-20-40 split) will help <i>a bit</i> here.  On that subject, collapsing both the 2nd and 3rd-row seats is quick, easy, and a 1-person job, which allows a flat floor to load the relatively large cargo space.  The lift gate gives you full-range access to this space, and the liftover height is lower than many small SUV's (about 30", again partially due to the low ground clearance).

<i>Driving</i>
Like mentioned above, it drives <i>almost</i> like a truck.  A bit too firm to be really comfortable on long hauls, but not bad.  Road feel is good, though I thought the power-steering a bit over-powerful.  Accelleration is decent, even with the "smaller" 4.7L engine.  The 5.9L is very nice (but a bit thirstier).  Again, I managed about 15mpg with 75% highway, 25% city, and what I would call a "medium" foot on the gas.

<i>Reliability</i>
Hasn't been too good in the past, but remember that "good" is relative.  The standard these days is much higher than it used to be.  Still, the Durango has had a higher-than-average drivetrain problem incidence, which should give you reason to think.

<b>OVERALL</b>
Like I said, I think it's beautiful, I think it's sexy, and I'll even add that it's relatively fun to drive on the road.  But, I wouldn't buy one.  I just think that for most people, definitely in my case, there are much better options out there.  But, if you're a small family with a large camper or boat to tow, I think you could do much worse.
