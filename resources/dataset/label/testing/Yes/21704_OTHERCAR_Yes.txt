            Nissan first came out with their new body style in 1998, when they decided to give the name &quot;Frontier&quot; to their very popular line of pickup trucks.  Today, there are many variations of this truck, ranging from single-cab, extended cab, and even 4-door varieties.  

I purchased my Frontier last year, and have had very little to complain about.  The truck offers a very nice ride, a comfortable cab (the Extended Cab is especially nice for taller folks, like me!), and a very pleasing body design.  For those who drive full-size trucks, this truck would probably be easiest to get used to, although it is rather easy for drivers of compacts and other light trucks to enjoy as well.  

Nissan has improved upon their original design with their 1999 and 2000 models.  People who purchased the 1998 models have been contacted to replace certain minor components, in order for Nissan to maintain its very reputable records of safety and customer satisfaction.

Some options that are recommended are:
-Bedliner (with OVER-THE-RAIL option)
-AM/FM/Cassette (CD changer is also available)
-Extended Cab!
-Alloy Wheels
-Chrome bumpers
-Automatic Transmission (these models come with 4 cup-holders!)

This truck is perhaps the best car I have ever owned!  I am looking forward to driving the 4-door version of this very soon!<br><br>
