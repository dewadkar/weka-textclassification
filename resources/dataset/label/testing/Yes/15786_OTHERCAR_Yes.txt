            How do you know these days how to really buy a good van?
You always have to ask yourself is this really what we want.Is the price to much for what you are getting.

Then comes all the driving of all the ones you think may be the best.
Start comparing all the options then ask yourself what do we really need on this van.We drove all makes of vans, and came up with another Chrysler.
This time we purchased a Town &amp; Country.

The vans of the year 2000 seem to be on the same type of chaise,as well as having similar features.
They did come up with crash protection across front,plus both sides.

I did research on the computer as we tested them and seems the best for us was the Town &amp; Country.

It has a bigger engine,which the dodge grande we had would cut out on hills,which this one does great.

Has 8 speakers and great sound system.

We brought it home and began to check it out from one end to the other
listening for road noise.How can we get rid of that without padding the interior so we just accepted it with a little noise.

The driving is just great and the seats are very comfortable.Very different from the dodge grande  we had.

I really think this will be a keeper and we took the maintence agreement that covers end to end for 5yrs..So we have to be ok now..Whee was hard to make up our mind.<br><br>
