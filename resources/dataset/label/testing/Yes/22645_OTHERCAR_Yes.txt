            You might end up spending a little more then you would on other pickups but it is worth it when you buy the toyota tacoma. This truck offers you luxury that is unexpected in trucks. While giving you the power that is expected out of toyotas veichles. It has tuns of room in the back of this truck but it is not over powering in size which is good for you people who dont wanna drive a huge automobile. Many people say that toyota has slipped off in performance but not in the tundra i was very suuprised to see the excellent handleing ability and great acceleration. This truck could turn on a dime while towing either a boat or a trailer now that performance.<br><br>
