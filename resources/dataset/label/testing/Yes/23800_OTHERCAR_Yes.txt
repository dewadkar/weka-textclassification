            I bought this vehicle because of the price but more importantly because it is a Toyota.  I have always driven Toyotas and they are top quality.  I really liked the different styling of the ECHO.  
It is not like most other cars on the road.  True, it is a little strange looking but that is why I liked it.  I also really like the way it drives. The fuel economy is fantastic.  I also find the interior really comfortable. The interior is much more roomy than it looks.  
I have plenty of legroom in the front and the back really isn't that bad either. The seats are built so that you sit up higher in the car than you do in say a Corolla.  The seats are comfortable and the dashboard has everything that you need in easy reach.  
There isn't much i don't like about the car. I wish I had a larger car but I don't really need the space. I don't like the placement of the radio, too low and too close to the stick shift. 
 It is also extremely hard to get certain options packages.  I wanted a model with slightly different options but one was not going to be available for a month or two.
The car gets pretty good acceleration.  More than I thought since the engine is small.  The car is very light which may not be great driving in snow or ice.  The trunk is also larger than you would think when just looking at the car. 
The car may not be big enough for a family but for anyone looking for a small,inexpensive, high-quality car, you really can't go wrong with a Toyota. 
 I don't know how the ECHO will do in terms of needing to service it, but i figure it should only require regular preventive care.<br><br>
