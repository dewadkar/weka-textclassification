            My husband and I bought a 1998 Chevy Tracker in January of this year. With most other vehicles that we have owned, I got bored with them within just a short time. So is not the case with my Tracker! I did a lot of searching for this vehicle online and finally found a dealer around the area that had one for the price we wanted to pay.

It was a little scary getting used to it at first. Not being used to having a soft top, when passing big tractor trailers, you knew it. But it didn't take long to get used to the sound of the air hitting off of it. We just recently had terrible storms and tornadoes around here and I was unfortunate enough to be stuck in them with my Tracker. It handled well in the wind, but the hail was scary. It beat down on the Bestop soft top, but no damage was done to it.

The week of May 18th-25th we took it on a road trip from Pennsylvania to North Carolina for vacation at the beach. It got nearly 30 MPG. It wasn't too bad comfort wise either. I think driving 9 hours in any vehicle would get tiresome, regardless of what you're driving. We knew before we went that we would have trouble fitting a weeks worth of items in the back, so we bought a cargo rack for the hitch. 

We took it out on the beach to ride up the coast. What fun that was! It was a little hard to handle on account of the larger vehicles making HUGE ruts in the sand, but we managed and had a blast doing it! We have no problem towing with it either. We own a 14 foot fiberglass boat that it has no troubles pulling. The handling is very well, for it being a small SUV.

The interior is pretty well layed out. It has cup holders in the console, within reach, which is nice. The back seat seems a little small, but I'm not back there too often to worry about it. It wouldn't be the type of vehicle I'd recommend for a family, but for anyone else it's great! It is sort of hard to see out the back window at times, as it is plastic. But that may be from the person owning it before us scratching it with something.

The heating and A/C work great. I was kinda worried about how well it would keep the heat in with it being a soft top. But there is definitely enough heat.

We haven't had the soft top completely off yet. The weather hasn't been warm enough without the chance of rain and we didn't want to chance it. :) We also haven't taken it off road, other than the beach. I told my husband "no mountain climbing until it's paid off!" :)

I think a lot of people expect more out of it then it can give. If you think you're going to get a Trailblazer or Explorer by purchasing a Tracker, pay the extra $7,000+ and get one of them instead. If you're looking for a vehicle to have fun in at a great price, by all means get a Tracker!
