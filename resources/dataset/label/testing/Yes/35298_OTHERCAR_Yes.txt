            I rented a 1996 Corsica with the 3.1 V6 back in 1997 to take a trip from Texas to New York and back.  I believe that I put some 3500 miles on the car.  Therefore, my review is based purely from a &quot;how it drives&quot; standpoint.  I believe the car had about 16000 miles on it when I started out, so everything was in good shape and worked perfectly.  The mechanical compontents of the car all seemed to be working so well.  The engine was smooth and quiet as was the transmission.  Power was addequate and for an economy car, I found the growl of the exhaust note to be pretty slick.  The interior of the car was typical Chevy.  Everything was comfortable and neat, but the grade of plastic used was a little on the cheap side.  The controls for the windshield wipers was also a little strange because it was potitoned on the side of the instrument pod instead of being on a stalk coming out of the steering column.  The front seats were horrible!  The lower back is not supported at all.  I would say I had a pretty sore neck after driving about 300 miles.  Also, the arm rest on the driver's door is poorly designed in that it has no cussion to it.  Therefore a sore elbow resulted after day 1 in the car.  The back seat and trunk were very spacious and the fold down feature was much appreciated.  The exterior styling of the car was a little funny.  The front clip looks like it is a size too small for the body of the car.  It kind of looks like there were tow design teams for the two sections of the car and communication broke down and a funky proportion ratio resulted.  Overall, I think the Corsica is a pretty good car.  I wouldn't reccommend buying a new one because this model is prone to lose vale VERY RAPIDLY.  A model with about 35000 miles on it would be a much better deal....pehaps one from a rental car company car lot would be wise to get into. <br><br>
