            The Minolta RD175 was introduced about 1995 as a pro digital camera. My main reason for buying was that it has the option of full manual control as well as fully auto. I had been using an Olympus 1400L (620? in the USA) for over one year and was frustrated at the lack of control. Most of the digital cameras aimed at the consumer end of the market are glorified point and shoot, which frustrates &quot;old&quot; 35mm users like me. The RD175 uses standard Minolta AF lenses, so that a range of focal lengths is available, and most of the Minolta accessories. It has 3 lcd's two for green and one for the red/blue end of the spectrum. The alleged 1.75 Megapixel resolution is only achieved by the Minolta software interpolating, the actual resolution is somewhat lower. When new it had a pro pricetag, it has now been superceded and I was lucky enough to get one at a reduced price because it was old stock. The results are very good, the color balance is excellent although some pictures seem to lack a biting sharpness, this can be enhance with unsharp mask in software. It's heavy, about 1Kg without lens, but this gives a very solid feel. Not for everybody, but if you like fiddling with exposure, lenses and everything inbetween buy it if you see one at the right price.<br><br>
