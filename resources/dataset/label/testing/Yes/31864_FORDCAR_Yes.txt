            Yep, you guessed it, the Ford Escort was my first car.  Coming right out of college, I of course didn't have any money, so I had to try and be somewhat economical, which trust me is not my strong point!
The car I ended up purchasing is a 97 Escort.  I believe this was the first year that the Escort was &quot;duded up&quot; to look less like the traditional Escort and more like all the other cars out there.  I have to admit that this is why I bought the car.  I really hate stereotypes, but I am a &quot;typical woman&quot; when it comes to cars.  What was most important to me?  How the car looked.  I have to admit it, even though I am ashamed by it.  
But I've had this car for three years now.  Not one thing has gone wrong, and all I've had to do was keep up on oil changes and tire rotation.  At my last oil change, they told me I will need new tires and brake pads.  I have done a lot of driving with this car.  Never a problem.  Most of this driving was done on the interstate, commuting to school.  I also live in Wisconsin, so the roads are not the most optimal.
I would highly recommend this car, the only work I've ever put into it was on the body, but that's a whole other story...
I've driven this car across the country and really had no aches other than the traditional, stuck in a car feeling.<br><br>
