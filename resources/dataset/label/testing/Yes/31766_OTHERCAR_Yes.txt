            I got this car mostly because I wanted a manual 4dr car and there aren't many options. Although I am generally happy with it there are a few serious problems

The environment system doesn't work.  The system is computerized and you are supposed to pick the temperature you want to feel and then let the computer figure out how best to do that.  The problem is it makes very bad choices.  Set the temperature to 72 and the computer turns on extreme heat on your feet making your feet and legs sweat BUT it turns on the air conditioning on your face and upper body making them freeze.

Turn off the &quot;computer&quot; to manual and it it's still bad.  At 72 degrees air that is uncomfortably cold comes out of the middle (Face/upper body) vents and warm air comes out the feet and window vents.  It's a no win situation.  As it is I leave it at 72, turn on the middle vent when it's a little too hot and turn on the top and bottom when it's a little too cold.

The other problem I have is that the sunroof/moonroof never seems to work.  If you want to open it as a sunroof you have to first go the otherway and open it as a moonroof, then re-close it and open it as a sunroof.  It refuses to directly go from closed to sunroof.

Those are my major gripes.

Other gripes.  It is a little small.  A full sized person in front and another behind that person is an uncomfortable fit.

Also, the stereo is on odd size therefore if you are interested in putting in a third party stereo system it will end up looking pretty ugly.  I was because the best they offer is a 6 CD changer and that's not enough for a CD enthusiast like me.

Things I like:

It feels powerful.  Much more powerful than the other cars I test drove.  (99 VW Passat, 99 Audi A4 1.6T, 99 Nissan Maxima)

The back seat comes down for larger storage (note: this is optional, not standard)

The German/BMW feel.  Most things feel solid.  When you move something or close something the car feels well built.  You don't hear anything jiggle around loosely.  It's hard to explain but go slam the door of a few different cars and you'll see.

Plus but could be a minus, the automatic windows go UP automatically in one press.  Most cars on the drivers side only have an &quot;auto down&quot; button for rolling the window all the way down in one press but then you have to hold the button to roll it back up.  In the BMW all the windows take one press to go all the way down and or all the way up.  Press them again to stop.  The bad thing might be that you could roll it up on your arm or something like that.  I haven't checked to see if it will notice something is blocking the window and stop but so far I've generally liked this feature.

There is a 3 year maintenance plan which I think is standard in which the BMW dealer will do everything but put in GAS.  I think they only change the oil every 15K miles but according to the manual that's okay.  The car's computer will tell you how many miles until the next time you are supposed to take it to the dealer.

The trunk seems fairly large although I don't now how it actually compares to other cars but I've had much smaller before.

Some other minor cool things.

If you forget to roll up your windows after you get out of the car you can put the key in the door, twist in the lock direction and hold it.  After about 3 seconds the windows will roll up.

Also, the car's key is remote control so you can lock/unlock without actually inserting the key.  Pressing and HOLDING unlock for a few seconds will roll down all the windows and open the sunroof.  This allows you to air out a hot car before you get in.  That's actually pretty cool.

BMW claims the new key system requires a chip in the key.  They claim that because of this new system BMW theft is down 80 percent.  That's very cool if it's true.

It's a good car but people assume you have stuffy attitude if you own one.  I don't like that.  I didn't buy this car to show off, I bought it because it was the best ride in the price I could afford.  If I ever get rich I'll get an M5.<br><br>
