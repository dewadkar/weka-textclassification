            I bought my first pick-up truck 6 months ago and the truck of my choice was the Chevrolet Silverado 1500.  I decided on this truck because I've always enjoyed the bowtie brand name and I had heard lots of great things about this truck.  I also enjoyed the sleek new look of the body style.  Along with it winning the J.D. Powers and Associates Truck of the Year Award for 1999 it has won several other awards which influenced my decision.  The Chevrolet Silverado has made a name for itself with a long line of great trucks and Chevrolet continues the tradition with this truck. 

<b>Good</b>: 

This truck has great performance.  The Silverado features a 5.3l Vortech V8 engine that puts out 270 horses and 315 lbs of torque.  It will tow ANYTHING that needs towing.  It is also rather quick for a half ton truck. Getting 0-60mph in 8 seconds, this truck also runs the quarter mile in about 16 seconds.  I've found that if you turn on the Tow/Haul button on the side of the transmission shifter (on automatic trucks) then the truck will be even quicker.  The reason behind this is because the Tow/Haul button the Chevrolet provides higher shift points on the RPM's of the truck therefore providing the speed to go higher. 

The handling of this truck is wonderful.  While taking sharp turns at full speed there are only a few shifts in weight of the truck.  The is great roadhandling in the truck which has to come from a great suspension.  I raised the torsion bars on my truck the first week I got it and it still rides as smooth as ever.  If you decide to do this then I would recommend getting your front end realligned on your truck as soon as possible in order not to wear down your tires because in re-alligning torsion bars the front tires bend inward cause wear on the outside of the tires.  I just enjoy driving this truck.  Everytime I get in the driver's seat it's a whole new thrill.  I can't describe it you'll just have to try it for yourself. 

The cabin of this truck is tremendously roomy.  The rear seat has the most leg room in it's class and is sloped up for maximum comfort.  The front seats are comfortable as well  featuring lumbar support and a 6-way automatic seat adjuster and of course a recliner.  I chose to go with the 40-20-40 split bench seat and I have been greatly please with it.  The controls are very conveniently located with the dash guages being right in
front of your face for perfect viewing.  The air conditioner and radio are also perfect for reaching.  I like to lay my hand on the automatic transmission shifter and the radio controls are right the at my hand.  The air conditioner also works great.  It blows cold air when it's hot and will really heat the truck up on a cold winter day. 

I also enjoy the new look of the Chevrolet Silverado.  The truck features a more &quot;rounded&quot; look instead of the old &quot;square&quot; look.  The truck will pull anything that you put behind it.  I've pulled out tree trunks, very heavy trailers, and even reflectors out of the highway.  I've also found that the turning radius is rather small for a truck this size. 

<b>Bad</b>: 

Fuel consumption is horrible on this truck.  I average about 14 mpg on the highway and 12 mpg in the city.  I must fill up with gas every week and it always costs about 30 dollars everytime I fill up.  I waste more money on gas with this truck than buying groceries.

The radio is not very well built at all.  I have to admit that it's much better than other radios in other cars but it still doesn't put out enough for me.  It features two rear subs and two front door speaker.  The door speakers are much better than the rear speakers but they could still use a large amount of work.  

The price is a bit expensive for all of this, running at about $32,000 loaded.  I chose the Z71 option which added a few dollars to the final price and also put a bit of weight on the truck and slowed it down a little.  This is a great truck for every off-road lover and I have really enjoyed owning it.
