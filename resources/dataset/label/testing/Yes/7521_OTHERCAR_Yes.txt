            For the most part I LOVE this car!  It's great for transporting kids...lots of safety features, including the little things like child proof locks on the back doors for when they're having a tantrum and threatening to throw themselves out the door at 70 MPH  (Hey...you never know what they might pull just to prove their point!)and window locks for when they find no greater joy than driving their sister crazy by raising the window and lowering the window, raising, lowering, raising, lowering...you get the point.
It has an an amazing amount of room and a HUGE trunk.  The back seat goes down for those occasional trips to the lumber yard or for when you're the lucky one who gets to transport great aunt-Bertha's vintage fishing pole collection. 
The car is extremely comfy...I've used it for several road trips.  It gets great gas mileage as well.   
If you're buying a used stratus..you do need to beware.  I have experienced this as well as several friends and coworkers have this car.  We have all had to have the head gasket replaced around 55,000 miles or so.  My co-worker just went through this situation and he tells me that Chrysler is (not officially) recognizing that the design for the mounting of these head gaskets was quite faulty.  While it cost me $700.00 to replace mine about a year ago, the dealership did his for $100.00.  Apparently Chrysler is absorbing the cost, not the independent dealership. 
Here's a tip...if you are looking into buying a used Stratus '98 or older, definately look into this issue. Has the head gasket already been replaced?  Will they assume responsibility for the work when it needs it?  If the sales rep doesn't seem too helpful, ask to speak to the district rep for Chrysler.  He's the person who offered the much lower price to my co-worker.
