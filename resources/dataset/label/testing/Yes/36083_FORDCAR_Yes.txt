            Well i recently purchased a ford ZX3 (2 -door version of the focus) and i must say it is one of the best cars that i have ever driven. I purchased this car mostly becuase of the test drives i took in it, i actually drove the 4 door SE and ZTS both in automatic and manual, and i also drove of course the ZX3 in both automatic and manual transmissions. All in all i prefered the preformance of the ZTS and ZX3 whice both have the upgraded 2.0 L zetec engine. Both automatic and manual transmissions preformed very well and the manual transmissions worked like a charm. The car has many standard as well as optional safetly features, optional features include ABS and Side Airbags. The car also has great gas mileage having a 25/33 MPG. Interior space is abundant in the front and still comfortable in the back, although tall people might have slight problems entering and existing the car. The focus has been advertised for gen-X and younger. The cars european design maybe too much for more concervative people and it is expected that ford will tone down the design in the years to come. As for handeling/performance, the ZX3 and ZTS with  a 2.0 L zetec engine and 16 valuves has a top speed of 112 MPH and accelerated to 60 MPH in aprox 10 seconds (manual trans) as opposed the the normal 2.0L 8 valve modles which have a top speed of i believe 103 and do 0-60 in aprox 12 seconds.  Handling is also a charm, I however have no ABS system, having one could pose a problem to those trying to do serious &quot;preformance moves&quot;. All in all the ZX3 is the perfect choice for a highschool/college student allowing you to have a very versitile car capable of carrying large funiture etc etc (simple witht he ZX3 hatchback which allows all seats except the front ones to lie completly flat thus enlarging your truck 2-3 fold. <br><br>
