            I am on a digital camera journey. I am going to review several of Sony's digital cameras in an effort to educate myself and my readers. I am in the market and if you are reading this, I assume, you are in the market for a digital camera too. These reviews will cover everything I can find on the Sony digital cameras available. This is the third review in this series. You can see previous reviews at:

This camera runs about $900.00 and can also be found at most large computer stores or ordered directly from Sony. I found the DSC-S70 to be &quot;the camera&quot;. I find the Sony family just gets better and better as I go on up the ladder of quality equipment available. The S70 is capable of video recording as well as still photography. 

The 3.34M resolution offers VERY high quality images. I was very impressed. The camera can be set up to use memory stick (although again, I was not using one) and can be used with Sony's digital photo printer. I used the USB interface and hooked the camera directly to the computer. I was really pleased with the ease of use. 

If you're looking for quality imaging, this will render your scanner utterly useless! I think I am in love!
