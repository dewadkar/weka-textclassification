            My family bought our Maxima because we needed a good fuel efficient car for commuting to work and back.  Well, the maxima is exactly that.  I personally don't like buying foreign cars, but I'm really starting to like the Maxima.

What I really like about it:
1.  It has good pickup.  I live near DC and it's quick pickup comes in real handy when I'm trying to merge onto some of the worst highways and roads in America.
2.  It's small, but stable.  I'm personally a fan of big cars.  I like to feel safe and powerful.  And when I started driving it, I didn't feel safe.  But within an hour I noticed that the car was quite stable and safe.
3.  The anti-lock yourself out system.  I'm the idiot that you'll see in the parking lot with a coathanger trying to unlock the door due to my keys being locked inside.  But, with the Maxima's door opening system, all you need is a few button pushes to get back in.

What I don't like about it:
1.  Our sound system went bad after about two weeks.  I also know several other people who own Maxima's and this apparently happened to them as well.
2.  The doors don't always close very well.  Instead of the usual doors that swing shut, the Maxima's kind of float a little bit, barely closing if at all.  Now this may come in handy sometimes, but when you're trying to carry several bags of groceries it can really be a pain in the butt.

Overall, it's a pretty good car.  I'm impressed, and I wouldn't suggest it as one of my faves, but if you see one for a good price, it's probably worth it.<br><br>
