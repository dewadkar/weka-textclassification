            We were searching for an extended cab pickup truck. I THOUGHT that the extended cab Dakota had a 3rd door (needed for kids here). I was about to head over to Chevy when I saw a Quad Cab that had JUST been taken off a truck. Went back the next day for a test drive (still hadnt been driven by anyone else), and decided it was the truck for us. Purchased it on the spot. LOVE the truck so far. Its the SLT version, with the 4.7L V8 and auto trans. Very impressed with the truck so far. Tons of room, and nice size bed. Dont for one second regret the purchase. Driving the truck is great, nice and quiet, lots of power, and gets lots of looks. Who shouldnt buy this truck? Anyone only looking for a two seater sports car. So far, theres nothing that I hate about the truck. We have had it for going on 3 months now, and love it. Would buy another in a second if we had a need.
