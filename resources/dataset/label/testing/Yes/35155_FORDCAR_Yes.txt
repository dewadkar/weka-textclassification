              FORD used to stand for Fix Or Repair Daily.  I stayed away from Ford my whole driving life until I needed a wagon when my children were small.
We first leased a Taurus wagon, then we leased a Ford Explorer (*****).  I purchased an escort as our second car in 1994.  I used it to commute over 100 miles a day with no serious troubles.  It was good on gas 25+mpg
and plenty of leg room.  The sound system was good.  It was traded in in '99 for another Escort.  Again I have not had any problems whatsoever
with this vehicle which now has 40k miles!  We have also bought an used '98 Explorer because we have had very good experiences with FORD.

Unfortunately, Ford is discontinuing the Escort series.  They have replaced it with the new Ford Focus in the 2000 model year.  So if you find a used Escort that you like, it is probably pretty good. 

Also, don't worry about not having spare parts for a discontinued model.  Car companies make their suppliers inventory parts for 10 years.  I know I work for a auto supplier.

Please don't drink and drive.<br><br>
