            this is a company van that i chose and received fresh off the lot. i have used this van for both personal and business purposes. our family has enjoyed this van tremendously and even though it's not a sports car, it has been a great car on the highways as a travel car.

for work, i can use this as a transportation vehicle when one or more guests are in town, and they can all fit in easily. i also have used this in my job to transport merchandise from city to city. i simply remove seats as needed until i have the space i need or all the seats to have the most space available.

as a family van, this is a dream for the entire family of four. we have increased our road trips because of the van. we can now all fit in and have our own separate part of the van and still have room for luggage, toys, and any extras we want to bring.

the ride is very smooth and the noise on the outside is kept on the outside. we love our van and plan to stay with the venture next time we need another vehicle.<br><br>
