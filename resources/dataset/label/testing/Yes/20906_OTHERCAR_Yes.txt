            This is the third Chrysler production car developed from a retro-style concept car. The first one was the Viper, then the Prowler came. Both of them are just low volume sports cars. In contrast, 100,000 PT Cruisers are expected to be produced in Toluca, Mexico. It'll also be exported to Europe as well as right-hand-drive markets. Without the success of New Beetle, Chrysler might not have dared to make a high volume retro car. 
From the 5-doors hatchback design you know it doesn't fall into the traditional American design. Instead of seeking room from length, width and wheelbase, it follows European and Japanese designs to raise the roof.
Because of the excessive head room, the rear passengers sit higher than the front, thus seeing clearly the scenery ahead of them. The chairs can be folded or detached to form different configurations (from 1-seater to 5-seater) to provide a large loading area. There is also a slideable shelf in the cargo area.   
There are three problems that I find with this design: first, the effective width of the cabin is far smaller than the track and body width suggests. This limits shoulder room and prevents the 5th passenger from sitting comfortably. Second, because of its retro design, the "cab-forward" design is lost. The windshield is rather close to the driver. Also, the front of the car is rather long by today's standard. The third problem is that the triangular shape of the engine compartment prevent a V6 from being installed into it. Therefore the engine line-up is limited to Neon's 2.0-liter sohc 16V (132hp) and Stratus 2.4-liter 16V (150hp / 167lbft).
As for the interior: the cabin is covered with cheap plastic, something common with many american cars. Dash and controls are simple and function oriented, but it seems it lacks more sophisticated gadgets (GPS). 
Surprisingly, PT Cruiser handles and rides well. Despite its height, it stays flat at corners and overcomes twisty roads. Steering feels meaty and direct. Gearshift is quick and precise. The Cruiser's breaks give good feedback.   
Ride quality is equally impressive - smooth, quiet and composed. Few American cars deliver such an enjoyable driving experience. Not even the Neon on which it is based.
If you are looking for a cheap family car, this is it!
