            I love the Mercedes E-class.  The E probably means that the car is equipped with everything that a luxury car needs.  My favorite cars from this class are the 320 sedan, and the 320 AWD sedan.  These cars are both equipped with four wheel drive.  These cars all have the standard equipment of a Mercedes. They include anti-lock brakes, 10-way power seats, a power sunroof, and the Smart Key System.  Of course, you can upgrade the car with a Command System which integrates the navigation system, radio, CD, and cell phone.  This is an available option if you desire.

These are just the electronic and standard features of the Mercedes E-class.  Both the 320 sedan, and the 320 AWD sedan have a V6 (6 cylinder) 3.2 liter engine.  That is a pretty good feature for a luxury car.  These cars also have a 221 horsepower engine.  You can probably blow a few cars off the road with this piece of beauty.  Speed is a rare, but  excellent feature for a luxury car.

With a Mercedes E-class car, you are able to enjoy a dead quiet ride.  This car can cruise the highway, and you will feel like you are in residential neighborhood.  You are not bothered by any annoying sounds of loud cars and trucks with this car.  This car also provides great protection.  All models are equipped with Head Protection Curtains that on the front side and rear side windows in case of a collision.

The looks of this car are striking.  At first glance, you may think that it is a Lexus because of the headlights.  The sleek, stylish look of the Mercedes E-class will make heads turn as you cruise down the street.  The comfortable seats are also a big plus in this car.  You could probably sleep in these comfortable seats.  

Although, this car is great in almost every aspect, there is one thing that most people will not like.  THE PRICE!  If you are interested in buying this car, it will cost you about $47,000.  However, I believe that this car is worth every last penny.  You will surely love this car if you purchase it.  This car definitely has STYLE!<br><br>
