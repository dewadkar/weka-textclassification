            I had the opportunity to borrow a Sony FD91 from my office for a few weeks and was hooked.  It was easy to use having so many automatic features, I was disappointed I'd just replaced my defunct 35mm last Christmas.   I used it for photos of equipment for online auctions and got some great still shots of my son's football games.  The pictures were noticably more crisp and clear.  The spot meter is a great feature and I use if often.  The zoom is powerful enough that I no longer miss my lens from my old Canon 35mm. I have experimented with the short video clip and it replayed just fine.  It is efficient since I don't have to spend money to develop pictures that I don't want.  For example, when taking one of the football action shots, a lady walked right in front of me and my photo had her head right in the center.  I simply erased it and took another.  Of course, I missed capturing that piece of action, but that's a danger with any camera!  

It was the only one I found with all of these features and the fact it uses a floppy disk was the final deciding factor.  When I had to take the loaner back to work, my husband soon was more enthusiastic than I about purchasing one of our own, and he hadn't really used it that much. The viewfinder and the screen are both great.  The only time I wouldn't use the screen might be in bright sunlight.  It was more difficult for me to see it then.  The steady shot was not set tonight when I tried to use it.  My husband had accidentally turned it off and boy could I tell the difference!  It didn't take me long to turn that steady shot on and the spot meter.  It is our favorite purchase and we have had no problems with it.  I also enjoy having the extra battery.  It has come in handy.  <br><br>
