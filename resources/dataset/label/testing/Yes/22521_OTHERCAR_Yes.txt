            Several years ago I was married to a man who fancied himself a bit of a grease monkey. He traded cars every two weeks, fixed them up, and traded them off again. Thus I drove a wide variety of vehicles including Toyota's, Nissan's, Ford's, Volkswagon's, Subaru's, Pontiac's and Chevrolet's of varied makes and models. 

After he met an untimely demise in a car wreck in 1993, I was left to fend for myself and my one year old daughter. At that point I had a Subaru with no windows in the back. But I worked hard at a furniture factory, and later on Advance Auto, in my little hometown and after a couple of years and a few more trades, was able to purchase a 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier. 

This is by far the best car I have ever driven!  With over 100,000 miles on the odometer, it shows little or no sign of engine wear, and through hauling my (now five, counting two step) children all over the country basically, the interior has maintained it's quality. Oh, that's another good point, though mine is a relatively small version of the Cavalier, we have managed to put four children in the back and one in the front with a fair amount of comfort. (Of course I put the two in the middle in the same seatbelt.)

With only a four cylinder engine, one would think that it would be starting to slow and show wear, however it can still get the jump on a mustang at a red light any day of the week. (Without the children in the car anyway.) Not to mention the fact that since it is a four cylinder, you can actually afford to put gas in it, even with gas prices the way they are today.

If you are contemplating buying a used car, the Chevrolet Cavalier really can't be beat. All round, it's the longest lasting, most durable car I have ever had and I hope to keep mine for many years to come although if the kids keep growing like weeds, we may have to add a bus to go along with it!
