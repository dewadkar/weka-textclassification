            I am the proud owner of a 1991 Dodge Dynasty for 9 years and 70,000 miles.
This has been a very good car and has never given me any problems.  Always ready to go when I am.  It is light blue in color with dark blue interior, has 4 doors and seats 6 passengers. I doubt I will ever find another car that has pleased me as well as this Dynasty.  I would recommend anyone to buy one.  It is just a shame the company stopped making them in 1993.  It is a family size car and very comfortable riding, and easy to drive.  I get good gas mileage, about 28 to 30 miles per gallon. And it looks just as good as the day I bought it because I have taken very good care of it.<br><br>
