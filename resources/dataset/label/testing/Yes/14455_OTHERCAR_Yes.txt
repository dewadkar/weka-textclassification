            I found my '96 Camry V6 LE used in the fall of 1998 while I was interviewing for medical school in Dallas.  And it was a GREAT find.  

It's a V6 LE, 2 toned (haven't seen very many of these), spoiler, leather, cd player w/ upgraded factory speakers, wood paneling, and moonroof.  It only had 11K miles on it also.  

Let me tell you that this car has been a pleasure to drive.  This V6 that toyota developed (also used in the Lexus 300 ES and perhaps other toyotas) purrs like a kitten, and when needed, it can accelerate like a tiger.  The engine has been trouble free with the proper maintenance (I follow the toyota recommended inspections for the most part).  

The car is very roomy, and although it may not have all the bells and whistles like it's high class brother (ES 300), the 2 cars are pretty similar other than the more quiet interior of the Lexus.  The Camry is definitely more noisy than the Lexus, but I don't notice too much.  

My only complaint about the car is that the alignment is knocked out of place too easily.  I've had to go in once (outside of maintenance) to get the alignment done.  This was a problem my mechanic told me about 96 Camrys, so watch out for those potholes!  

I definitely recommend this car for the family or for a medical school student driving around town.  =)

Toyota has always made good cars, and the 96 Camry continues that tradition.  <br><br>
