            One year ago we gave in our Jeep and went looking for another sport utility. We were happy with the Jeep but felt it was too small. The cargo is way too small and it only holds 5 passengers.  Anyone with more than 2 kids, knows
that a 5 seat cargo car is not enough. We had to get a cargo top in order to take our thrice yearly vacations.

So we set out to look for the bigger SUV. That included
the Navigator,Lexus,4-runner,Suburban and Durango. It was not even our intention to place the Surburban high on the list, besides it was a huge behemoth and a Chevy!!!!!

All the other SUV's we looked into were not quite as big as they seemed.  The Navigator, although a big looking car with
extremely well appointed amenities, was very hard to get to the back row(third row). The third row had no leg room. Children, let alone adults would have a very difficult time sitting in the back.  We looked at the Lexus 450. It was a big, beautiful car, fully loaded. Then the salesman told us the lease would run over $900.00 per month!! Yikes!!!!
For lack of a clear choice we then decided to look at the Suburban.

We looked at the Surburban and the GMC version(Tahoe?). Both were very similar(they should be... they are the same car!!!!). We were astounded by the amount of room. It is in short, a boat.  I thought i would have to mail a letter to say hello to my daughter in the third row. OK, how would it drive???  My wife, the ultimate judge(men don't mind driving trucks....) took it for a run and came back and said this is for us.  The lease deal was cheaper than any other similar car(500-600/month).  Although we couldn't find our color(the car was on backorder) we went with our second color choice .  So it was now all ours(at least for three years!!!).

They say you can't, though matter what your friends tell you, know about whether it is a good car until after a year.  Well it is a year later and our answer is 
GET IT!!!!  Buy or lease this car(2000, 2001 whatever)!!!!

What impresses us the most is that it is well designed. The cup holder are all in the right places(all eight of them). The dash is easy to read and utilize. The sound is great.
The heating/ air conditioning has three zones. The kids can listen to the CD on earphones, while you listen to the radio.  The glove box is big.  The seats are comfortable. And of course you are truly the king of the road. No body messes with this baby!!!  The cargo is plentiful and easily adaptable. The back seat folds down for more space, rather easily.

Does it sound like we like it?? The answer is no!!! We LOVE IT!!!!!!  For all those who say it rides like a truck???
Of course it does, it is a truck!! But you know what, it is quieter than the Jeep or the RAV(our other car). It is quieter than it is given credit for. If quiet is your only consideration, get a high ended luxury vehicle.  But if your needs are for a SUV, than the decibel level is more than OK.  

Another thing.... it is not bumpy, or trucky in it's feel. I've driven cars that feel the bumps far more than this car!!!  As for mileage... My friends kid me(or at least the jealous ones) that it gets 2 miles to the gallon.  Of course it eats gas. but not as much as you think(i would guesstimate, 17 MPG). If you want gas mileage then get
a Honda Civic!!!!

Only one bad item to report... the spare tire is under
the truck.  My wife had a  flat(a nail in the tire) for which the spare had to be put on. The ability to get to and put back the spare is one big pain in the ....... It is held by a cable and takes forever to figure out how to us a stored away crank to lower it and lift it. Have a mechanic do it!!!!!


One last item... if you don't want lots of kids in your car,
stay away.  My kid's friends are in love with the car and always want to ride in it!!!!
