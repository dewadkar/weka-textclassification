            We purchased a 2001 Odyssey just over a month ago.  Here in the Northeast, Odysseys are hard to come by.  Most dealers take advantage of this by offering the vehicles for MSRP and adding a handful of unwanted options totaling hundreds of dollars.  Most have months-long waiting lists, and most of those require a deposit.

Once we knew we could sell our 1999 Volvo V70 (see my Epinion on this car), I started researching local Honda dealers and found most of them out to rape me.  It was during this time that an amazing thing happened.  I began to actually covet an MSRP deal.  With any other car, my DH negotiated his butt off.  But supply and demand being what they are, MSRP for an Odyssey is a rare thing.

Out of the 20-25 dealers I called, I found three offering MSRP deals and put myself on waiting lists at two of them, one of which didn't require a deposit.  Six and a half weeks later I had my vehicle...and it was worth the wait.

I LOVE this car.  I'm one of those people who never thought she'd own a minivan, but the Odyssey doesn't seem like a behemoth.  It drives just like a car, and has a ton of really great options to enhance the experience.

I think my favorite is the disappearing third seat.  With only minimal effort, the third seat folds into a well in the floor.  Once this is done, the cargo area is flat and very spacious.

Amazingly, I've only had to consult the manual once.  The controls are well-laid out and logical, obviously designed with safety in mind.  For example, radio stations can be changed and volume adjusted by pressing buttons on the steering wheel, enabling the driver to adjust the radio without taking her eyes off the road.

While the Odyssey doesn't have all wheel drive, it has a traction control system which a friend tells me works great (it hasn't snowed here since I got the car!).  It also has very impressive pickup, which makes me feel secure getting on the highway.

Before we decided on the Odyssey I also drove a Toyota Sienna, but I felt the visibility wasn't good enough.  I also had to have that disappearing third seat.

We thought it odd that on our EX model, the antenna doesn't retract.  Also, the low fuel light goes on with approximately six gallons left in the tank.  According to a mechanic at our dealership, Honda hasn't found a way to compensate for an empty cargo area.  When there is a light load back there, the rear of the vehicle is slightly raised, which causes the gas to flood toward the front, skewing the sensor and falsely illuminating the light.  A minor annoyance at most but worth mentioning.

We bought the Odyssey because we make one or two long car trips per year, and it was a challenge to get all our gear into the Volvo.  I would recommend the Odyssey to anyone who's interested in something that drives like a car but has the space of a minivan.

Note:  The Odyssey is one of a handful of 2001 vehicles equipped with the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) system, which is mandatory for all 2002 vehicles.  The point of the LATCH system is to make the installation of carseats easier and more standardized than it is now.  [According to numerous sources, the vast majority of carseats are installed incorrectly.]  The Odyssey has attach points built into the second row seats, as well as a tether anchor point for each seat.  This makes installation virtually idiot-proof (I did it myself!).  You will have to buy a LATCH-compatible carseat, though, and currently there are only two on the market:  Fisher-Price Safe Embrace II ($150 at Babies R Us), and Cosco Triad ($80 exclusively at KMart).  Guess which one we chose!!
