            I own a 1990 Chevy C/K 1500 454 SS.  Too bad she isn't a woman, cause I am in love.  I bought this truck because I am a big fan of power and this truck pleases me very much.  The torque in this truck is outrageous.  Stock it came with 400 ft. lbs of torque and 230 horsepower.  The horsepower can be a little higher, but that's where I come in.  This engine is very detuned.  It is a big sleeping giant waiting to be awaken.  I have done some mods to the engine, about $ 2000 worth, and I am pretty sure that I am in the 300 range and around 460 ft. lbs of tire smokin' torque.  If I could keep the wheels from spinning, I could tow almost anything.  The 454 SS models are getting old now, and if you are looking for a future collectors item that has some power under the hood, I suggest you finding one and buying it.  The truck from the dealer came with power steering, deluxe stereo, 3.73 positrck rear end, power windows &amp; locks, high back bucket seats w/ center console, tinted windows, sliding rear window, sport handling package, and a monsterous BIG BLOCK under the hood.<br><br>
