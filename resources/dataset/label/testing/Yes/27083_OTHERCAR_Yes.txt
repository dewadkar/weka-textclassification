            One day, a friend at work asked me if I wanted to take her black Dodge Viper RT/10 for a spin. Say what? Did I hear that right? I get to drive my dream car??

<i>How can I refuse such a generous offer?</i>

<b>Exterior</b>

There's not much to say about the Viper's appearance, except that it looks mean, no matter which angle you look at it. The curves scream muscle.

<b>Interior</b>

The seat felt tight, but it's supposed to, as it will hold you when you take turns quickly. I felt right at home as I was able to feel feedbacks from the car and the road. Steering was quick &amp; precise. All the gauges were analog, and visible, and seemed well-placed, but I can't tell you much more because I was more excited about driving the car than being critical of gauge positioning!

<b>Adjustable Pedals</b>

This is one of the coolest feature on the Viper - pedal positions are adjustable to suit each driver. I didn't want to adjust it on this car, as it wasn't mine. Consequently, the brake pedal felt awkward - oh well, no heel-and-toe for me on this drive.  

<b>The Shifter</b>

The six speed shifter has a short throw that's very solid. It took me a little time to adjust, as I missed 4th gear on the first try, as I'm used to 4 speed and 5 speed shifters where I just slam down to 4th gear - on this Viper, I had to nudge it away from me a little to engage 4th correctly. The clutch pedal felt fine, nothing unusual.

<b>The Drive</b>

I told myself not to rev the engine above 5000 rpm, and away we went. As I got out of the parking lot, I punched it - 1st, shift, 2nd, shift, 3rd, oops can't find 4th, shift, traffic up ahead, brake! <i>Wow</i>.

I was awestruck by the V-10's torque - it kept on pulling and pulling. Most cars I've driven would start to lose its pull around 4500 rpm, but this monster wanted more! Imagine if I had shifted the gears at 6500 rpm!
  
<b>Lateral Grip</b>

Next thing to try was lateral grip, and I decided to take the uphill, sharp S-curve freeway onramp in 3rd gear with throttle. Before the last half of the S, I punch it, shift to 4th (correctly) - whoa, we are already flying past traffic - shift to 5th, still pulling... OK, that's enough, I don't want to kill anyone now - lift. <i>Amazing</i>.

I took the Viper up the onramp at speeds which would have made the tires of other cars I have scream for mercy, but it seems the Viper didn't care, wanted to go faster. <i>It can go faster??</i>

<b>Cruising in 6th gear</b>

Now that I got my adrenalin rush over with, I decided to drive the Viper easy, in 6th gear. The tachometer read about 1600 rpm at 70 mph, and suddenly, the monster was tame. The car was relatively quiet, as I was able to carry on a conversation with the owner of the Viper, sitting happily in the passenger side. I had to downshift to 5th gear to pass, and boy is passing easy in this car, even in 5th!

<b>Forced to Shift Late</b>

Typically when I drive a car easy, I shift early (at lower rpms) as I don't need the acceleration, but this Viper didn't like that. The gear ratios were spaced apart, so I had to rev the engine higher before I shifted to 2nd, or the engine would lug. It's as if the Viper was telling me, &quot;Don't be a wimp, drive me the way I was designed, <i>fast!</i>&quot;

<b>Overall Impression</b>

What can I say? I was all grins after I took the owner for lunch, my treat. The Viper is everything I thought it would be, and then some. With no fancy driver aids that waste weight like ABS brakes and automatic transmission, the Viper's all about pure power and pure speed. It's too bad I don't have the money to buy one right now. I'm determined to own one someday, as this drive has intensified my dream, the Dodge Viper.

<i>Note: I also own a track-ready 1969 Mustang, which has a 300~315 hp engine, with six point roll cage. The Viper is faster all around, and quieter, too. The title of this epinion is based on a license plate frame I saw on another Viper, &quot;Porsches for Breakfast, Ferraris for Lunch&quot;</i>
