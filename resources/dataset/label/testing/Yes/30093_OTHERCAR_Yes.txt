            I purchased my DC-280 from Buy.Com and got delivery in less than 24 hrs.  Price was great but the product was unbelievable!  They aren't kidding when they say the camera is very easy to use.  I took it on a business trip to Singapore and Japan and recorded photographs both indoors and outdoors.  The camera took excellent shots with built-in flash and the exposure compensation feature helped produce excellent contrasting shots indoors without a flash or a tripod.  We took the camera after that on a trip to Lake Tahoe and got some great panorama shots in.  

The camera is Kodak's best value/offering yet and with the included USB interface cable and optional 96Mb storage cartridge we will be digitally capturing the Millenium on our upcoming trip to Europe and e-mailing our friends and families from cyber cafes along the way!  What fun!  A must for every serious photographer/business traveler!
