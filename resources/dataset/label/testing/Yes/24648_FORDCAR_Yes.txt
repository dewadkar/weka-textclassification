            My family and I are currently on our second Aerostar.  Our first was purchased by my daughter and I while my wife was still in the hospital after just giving birth to our son.  It was a used 1990 Extended XLT with @60K.  We used the van to help us move when we bought our first home and to help family move by pulling out the seats and loading items out of the weather and for hauling family during camping and vacation trips.  The only major mechanical work required was the rebuild of the transmission with nearly 150,000 miles on the clock due to my not checking and changing the fluid.  In November of 1999 my wife and kids were side swiped at an intersection.  The Camry driver ran a red light and hit them at approximately 45mph behind the drivers door.  The van tipped on two wheels and came back down facing almost in the same direction they had come from.  The van's subframe kept the car from rupturing the fuel tank and going farther into the van and possibly killing my family.  So after 186,000 miles I was off to search for another Aerostar.  After weeks of looking we found a 1995 AWD Extended 4.0L with 85,000 miles.  The way I look at it, my 90 lasted over twice this so it has plenty of life left in it.  We have put nearly 3,000 miles on it so far and love it.  The 4.0 is great and the AWD came in handy during the few snows we have had.  The gas mileage is a shock, but the roominess and power are exceptional.  I have driven the Dodge and Chrysler products and do not feel as comfortable in them.  I am 6'4&quot; tall and am able to drive all day with no problems.  Plus the added advantage of the frame is a great asset.<br><br>
