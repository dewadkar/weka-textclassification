            The '92 GMC Jimmy, for the most part, is the typical SUV -- on the gas-guzzling side with a height advantage that annoys drivers of smaller cars.

But one aspect stands out on this Jimmy: the dashboard display.  Oy, what a mess.  

The '92 GMC Jimmy is equipped with a dashboard that makes the driver feel as if he's in a video game.  And not even a <i>good</i> video game.  More like a game for the Sega 32X.  

The speedometer, gas tank measurement, etc. readings are digital.  This can be <i>extremely</i> distracting at first.  When one is used to the the metronomic motion of the plastic pointer, it can be strange to look down at the speed and be greeted with a 100-point bright blue number.  It's mesmerizing to watch it go up and down, up and down, up and down -- where was I?

When the gas tank reaches a quarter tank, the gas tank measurement flashes.  &quot;Fill me!&quot; it's screaming, and it can't be avoided.  It's been over a month since I purchased the car, and I'm still not accustomed to this feature.  Of course, it's an incentive to get the tank filled.  &quot;Stop it, damn you!  Stop your incessant blinking!&quot;

And for those who have owned SUVs in the past, one feature that is almost unique to the Jimmy is that he side mirrors are the size of car mirrors.  That took a week or so to adjust to because my previous SUV had the hulking truck mirrors.  

The Jimmy has more pickup than most SUVs, and it drives more like a car than an SUV.

After having driven an older, more rugged SUV for four years, I've found that I like the car/SUV hybrid feel of the Jimmy.  But, dear God, I hope GMC had the sense to get rid of the video game dashboard after this model year.
