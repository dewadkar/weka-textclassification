            After car shopping for two weeks, I decided on the Monte Carlo and for the most part have been extremely pleased with it.

 Most of the newer cars aren't large enough to hold a family of 5 but this one is. I'm happy with the overall performance of this car, drives very smoothly, has get up and go, not to forget that it's an attractive looking car. However I do feel they could of made it more sportier looking seeing how the name Monte Carlo is on it. 

Some of the drawbacks I have found are..though the trunk is roomy,the way it is designed makes it difficult to put semi tall boxes in. For you smokers, the ashtray is not in a very good location and you will miss it more times than you will hit it. The one problem I do have with my car mechanically is, in the winter a lot of times the windshield washer fluid holes become frozen, not allowing the fluid to come through! And any time the car is washed or it rain's heavily, the driver side door will squeak terribly until I put some W-D 40 on it.

Putting these thing's aside, I have been very pleased with my Monte, the price was good,performance is solid,attractive and roomy enough for a family.Do keep in mind though that the Lumina is the exact same car but is the 4 door model!It usually is also offered at a slightly cheaper price.<br><br>
