            This is the first DSC I owned. I purchased this camera six months ago at employee price. Since then the price has dropped significantly and now the retail price with mail in rebate is $100Cdn cheaper than the price I paid. 

Originally I was sold on the idea that this camera can use alkaline batteries, which comes with the camera, but was I wrong! The alkaline batteries will last only 5 minutes of use. I believe a lot of people who purchased this camera would think they have got a defective camera and would have returned it. 

The camera also comes with 4Mb memory. At the highest resolution it will allow you to take about 6 pictures. So after dishing out another $300 Cdn. to buy the accessory kit (infolithium battery, AC adapter and case) and a 32 Mb memory I can finally enjoy the camera. When you add this all up you can almost buy a Sony DSC-P3 camera which is a lot more compact.

Features
This is a 2.1 mega pixel camera with 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom. Also has macro feature. I would consider this enough for most day to day amateur use.

Recycling time - Takes about 2-3 seconds before another picture can be taken. As this is a digital STILL camera, it is good for doing what is does, taking still images. As this one does not have a burst mode, it would be extremely difficut if you try to take picture of a moving object. You have to turn off the automatic focus and automatic exposure and set up the setting beforehand and turn off the flash as it takes a second or so for camera to use the infra red to determine the focus and the settings. By that time your object will be long gone.

Picture data can be stored as JPEG(standard and fine), GIF or TIFF. I always use the highest picture quality. One feature this camera allows you to do is to make a copy of the picture in lower resolution within the camera, so you can email the picture in smaller file size without using a photo editing software.

MEPG EX - Clip motion or MPEG movie at 320X240 or 160X112 with no time limit (Up to size of memory stick). At 19 fps the movie is a little jumpy, but I guess that's what you get with MEPG-1 movie anyways. Adding sound would be nice. Camera also allows you to clip and store a copy of the movie you've made in the memory stick.

Picture effect - Solarize, B&W, Sepia, Negative art. Since photo editing software can do this, I have not used this feature.

Twilight shooting - I find this feature most useful in dark situation where you don't want to use flash, or when shooting in close range using macro mode and flash will give to the reflection.

Viewfinder - Using camera under bright light would render the LCD display impossible to see. In this situation you have to use the viewfinder. Viewfinder is kind of small and picture taken does not match the view you see in the viewfinder, and I have to use the photo editing software to crop the picture afterwards.

Connectivity - Video out allows you to connect camera to TV and play a slide show of pictures taken. USB cable provided to connect to PC for downloading files. 

Software - Very basic. Have to purchase something more useful for serious photo editing.

Update: Just got the news on the new model replacing this camera, it will be 3 megapixals, comes with NiMH batteries and charger - Yes, no more alkalines, and 16Mb of memory (still not enough, but better than 4Mb).
