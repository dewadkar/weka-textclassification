            I have been driving my emerald green 1995 Protege ES since February of 96, and for the money and my almost 5 years experience I couldn't be happier with it. 
I purchased the 95 ES after trading up from my 94 protege after being won over on a Test Drive. The 94 version was much less structurally rigid, and had the the &quot;basic&quot; no frills trim (vinyl everything except seats). The 95ES was fully loaded with the 1.8 liter 122hp double overhead cam engine. From a driveability standpoint there was no comparison. Not that the 94 didn't drive and handle well, to the contrary it was a dream to drive- very refined and athletic for a subcompact. But the 95ES was in a different class entirely,and reminded me of how my 87 Toyota MR2 made me feel so long before. The ES held the road like glue, while the spunky high- revving engine pulled like a train to it's 7000 RPM redline. Absolutely wonderful and smooth, but unlike the MR2 extremely roomy and practical.

5 years later I am still enjoying my Protege, which now has almost 123,000 miles on it, but continues to run like a well-designed machine. Since owning my Protege I have driven Corollas (solid, but bland and boring), Nissan Sentras (well-made, but claustrophobic), Subaru's (all wheel drive is nice but what's with those damned frameless windows, and horrible interior ergonomics?) and my wife's 98 Honda Civic ES (I absolutely hated this car- it was unstable at speed, light, cramped, had horrible seats, and was boring even with despite it's great 5 speed and zippy engine. Luckily we traded the Civic in for another great vehicle- a 97 Nissan Pathfinder- see my review on this SUV.

The Protege, also exhibited wonderful handling in the snow, while the Honda truly sucked. I could easily drive the Protege out of a parking space after a plow came by, while the Civic's similar frontwheel drive provided absolutely no escape from snow. In my honest opinion Honda's are way overrated anyhow. Dollar for Dollar the Protege is an Accord competitor, and trounces all over the &quot;Toy&quot; Civic.

Personally, I think Mazda built a great little car. Sure it's interior materials aren't as good as Honda's, but it is much more comfortable for my 6'2&quot; frame, and over 123,000 miles none of the trim has come apart or broken. So it would seem as if the interiors's lack of tactility doesn't detract from it's durability.

The Protege shows no signs of dying anytime soon, and continues to be ultra reliable in any weather. It's structure continues to be solid and tight with the exception of plastic squeaks and wiring harness rattles that come and go with the weather(dampness and cold tend to make things start talking).

It's drivetrain is smooth 90% of the time, while the other 10% is punctuated by 5 speed balkiness, an overenthusiastic engine diagnostic light (caused mostly by my wife's driving style) and a suspension that is starting to show signs of age (I have yet to replace any part of the suspension, but the rear companents do tend to click on occasion). Other than those instances this car will easily take me into the 200,000 miles range as long as I continue to maintain it.

I have always been religious about maintaining my Protege. I believe it's quite ironic for people to forget about taking care of their cars when they spend so much damn money buying them. I think that part of the reason my car has been mechanically perfect is because I have religiously maintained it over the past 5 years, and continue to deal with small issues before they blow up into major failures.

Anyway, I digress, I would buy another Mazda product in a minute. In fact if Ford doesn't mess with Mazda's engineering practices I will find it hard to rationalize purchasing anything but another Protege for my growing family.

4 stars for value, considering I paid a pretty steep price for the ES new.
And 5 Stars for overall, considering the way the Protege has treated my over the years since I purchased it.<br><br>
