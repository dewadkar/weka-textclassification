            After my poor maintenance and sloppy driving killed my last American made car I read Consumer Reports and decided to have a go at destroying an import.  I bought my Toyota used in 1990, it had 30,000 miles on it, it is a 1988. 

I love its reliability, low maintenance cost, and the low gas mileage.  I don't like how it shivers in fear when larger vehicles pass us.  I don't like how hard the hamsters under the hood have to work when I accelerate -- the car does not have much pick-up.  Like most small cars it's easy to park.  The ride is a bit bumpy for folks used to bigger cars.  

It's the ultimate economy car.  I'm close to two hundred thousand miles and still going strong.  I have several friends with Corollas who have gone beyond 200,000 miles.  It is a great car for urban drivers, economy seekers, and cautious folks.  Someone who does a lot of highway driving might want a larger car with more potential for speed.<br><br>
