            Over the years I have driven lots of vehicles.  Since I am an avid hunter and back road driver I need a vehicle that is tough, capable of getting into tough spots, and versatile.  I also sell Real Estate, and use my vehicle for work and the family car.  As my two daughters mature the ole Extended cab trucks were not cutting it on our long trips to Mexico.

Alas!!! comes the Suburban.  Now picture a guy who is 40 who grew up hunting, necking, hauling, and cruising in a truck since he could drive.  I could feel my male ego dripping out on the sales managers desk as I negotiated for my new suburban.  

Well folks I have owned two of them, since the day I left my ego in the dealership, and I will never drive another vehicle.

I have hunted and hauled animals as big as Elk in the payload compartment.  I have driven the roughest, dirtiest roads known to man.  I hauled all the lumber I needed to remodel my home, been to the landfill a time or two, and on Sunday night rinsed the beast off and showed homes through the week.  ALL without a problem.  I've even managed to maintain some male ego when my friends kid me about my overgrown Station Wagon.

The model we bought was a slight conversion in that it had nicer, and plusher leather seats than factory, and it had a television in the center console.  The cost was surprisingly low at $38,500.  We didn't get any extras except the towing package.  I did not get the off road package as the vehicle is plenty tough without it.

We haul a boat on long trips, and I also pull a 22 foot camp trailer.  Living in Northern Arizona there is a lot of up and down free way driving.  We drive from temperature extremes of 10 below to 110 degrees in the desert.  My Suburban has never over heated while towing and we have never had a break down.

On long trips the seats in the rear are wonderful for the kids to take naps, and watch a video on the TV.  I have all weather tires so the highway ride is remarkably smooth.  The tread on the tires is still aggressive enough to get me where I need to be while hunting.  Snow and ice driving is a breeze with the weight evenly distributed on all four tires.

I show numerous properties to high end customers who always comment about the luxurious feel of the vehicle.  When hunting I easily haul three other hunters and all of their gear.  On hunts that are a long way from home, the Suburban is the only vehicle for a luxury ride there, and utility use when I get there.

The Suburban is roomy, and large, but still easy to park in tight places.  My daughter who just learned to drive was not intimidated by the size in the least.  A trip to the gas pump is not for the faint of heart, but this vehicle is truly worth the extra cost associated with gas.  I consistently get 11 to 13 miles per gallon around town, and 15 to 17 miles per gallon on the highway.  Towing is a different story with a 50% drop in mileage.

This vehicle will be popular well into the 21st century.  As near as I can tell NASA modeled the space shuttle after the suburban.<br><br>
