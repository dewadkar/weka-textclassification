            After driving a 1993 4x4 Suburban for 8 years and 150,000 miles, my 2001 Yukon XL Denali is the ultimate dream!

My Denali has everything I ever wanted that my '93 didn't.  The biggest 3 advantages of the Denali are power, Power, and POWER!  These advantages are followed by handling (the autoride option is an absolute must), comfort, quietness, and the concert hall stereo.

I recently did a 2500 mile loop thru southern Utah and southern Colorado.  This trip included over 8 hours of off pavement driving including Canyonland National Park's Shafer Trail.  On pavement driving included cresting 13 mountain passes over 10,000 feet.  Upon arriving home, the trip computer told me the Denali averaged 17 mpg!

The power this vehicle showed on this trip meant that we were always able to stay at the speed limit no matter how steep the hill!  My '93 could pass only while in free fall, but the Denali did me proud every time I asked it.

This vehicle was so comfortable on this trip, that after averaging 8 hours on the road a day for 10 days, we 4 adults and 2 dogs were rarely tired enough to bicker!  I was even still friends with my Mother-in-Law!  We loved the auto climate controls (separate front and back) and the heated seats!

My specific dislikes are few:  there's nowhere around the front seats to store either a road atlas or a full sized tissue box except up on the dash, and the cruise control tends to be too eager on resume to kick the engine up over 4000 rpm.

Other likes include OnStar personal calling because it uses ALL the major cell provides which maximizes the calling coverage area, and the driver's seat memory which was great for 6'3" me and my 5'4" wife.

The only problems we've encountered so far were both headlamp mounting brackets coming loose, and a blown front wipers fuse which we replaced ourselves using the provided spare and tool when in the middle of nowhere, Utah!
