            My husband and I purchased this vehicle shortly after the birth of our daughter.  We needed something with more space, but the whole station-wagon/min-van thing just didn't appeal to us.  We're still young, and wanted something that reflected that, yet was roomy enough to accomodate children.  This was it.

The Rodeo is an excellent vehicle.  It's got SUV appeal, while maintaining the feel of a car.  It can really pick up, having a v-6 engine, and cruise smoothly over those rough spots on the road.  The options available are priced for affordability, so you can dress your rodeo in any attire that reflects the true spirit and personality of the driver within.  All while sitting high above all those people below in their sports cars.  You can give them quite a run for their money in this SUV, and your view of the road is much better than theirs!!

If you're a single person looking for driving excitement, a young to middle aged family looking for roominess and affordability, or an older person who doesn't want to crouch their way into the driver's seat, then this is the vehicle for you.  The Rodeo is VERY roomy on the inside, even in the backseat.  Its controls are easy to reach, and it has lots of power outlets for your convenience.

I would definately recommend this SUV to anyone who has a taste for adventure.  Because getting behind the wheel of this one is an adventure all its own.....<br><br>
