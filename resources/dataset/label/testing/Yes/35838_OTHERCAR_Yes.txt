            Here's a testament to how much my wife and I love Saturn's - We've owned 5 in the past 4 years!  

Despite having just sold our 1993 Saturn SL2 for reasons totally unrelated to the quality or our love of the car, I would like to still provide my opinions on this excellent vehicle.

We originally purchased the 1993 SL2 used in January of 1997 as a replacement to my wife's 1991 SL1.  At the time, the car had 67,000 miles on it, but was immaculately cared for - the previous owner had all scheduled maintenance done at the retailer, so we were able to see the entire history of the car.  This car was an automatic with ABS/Traction control and upgraded Stereo to the CD player.

As I said, we just sold this car 2 months ago at about 110,000 miles and during the time we owned the car, we had only one problem which was covered under warranty.  The engine is extremely peppy - tap the gas and you are moving in this little 4-cylinder DOHC engine.  Fit and finish were still great, even when we sold the car.  Only some minor squeaks were heard.

I must also say something about Saturn's service - this is why we've owned so many Saturns in the past 4 years.  THEY ARE GREAT!!!  I had a problem with my 1997 SL2 when I bought it new in late 1996 - well, they were just as perplexed that they couldn't get the problem fixed that they decided to buy back the car for 100% of what I paid for it (even though I'd driven 10,000 miles on it) and I bought an identical SL2 that never had a problem.  The service techs have always been HONEST, friendly, and courteous.  And my wife has always been treated with respect - many dealers will talk down to women, assuming they don't know about their car or something.

OK, I know you are wondering why we got rid of this car if we had loved it so much. . .  Well, we have begun to have a family and now need something a bit bigger to haul the rugrats around in.  Unfortunately, we do not live within 75 miles of a Saturn retailer currently and we consider the entire experience in getting oil changes and all service done at the retailer essential to the Saturn owner.  Because of this, we have opted not to try out the L-series just yet (until we move again, closer to a retailer).  Man, am I missing the whole Saturn experience after dealing with a traditional &quot;dealer&quot;. . . . <br><br>
