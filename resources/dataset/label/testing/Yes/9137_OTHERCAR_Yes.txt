            So your wanting to buy a new car..lets say an SUV. I have the perfect choice for you. It's the 2000 Lincoln Navigator. This vehicle should be the dream car on everyone's list. Fist of all, the room in the Navigator is great. There is plenty of it. It can fit up to eight people. This should be ideal to those who have to take clients around. There is also a sun roof that opens with the click of a button. If your lost in some place, all you have to do if get in touch with the CD-Rom system included in the car. From personal experience, it gives you awesome directions. There is also a cellular phone and wonderful speakers. Lincoln is totally insured this car with safety. It has airbags as well as an anti theft system. If your looking for a car such as a Navigator, I strongly suggest you buy it. I will promise to you that you will be satisfied.<br><br>
