            This is my fourth digital camera.  I have always been a fan of NIKON digital cameras. Having checked out the reviews on the Canon S230, I was determined to buy one and try it out for myself. All I have to say about this camera is one word: AWESOME.  I cannot believe the quality of the pictures this thing puts out... almost comparable to my NIKON 995 - and in some instances, similar picture shots have exceeded the quality of my NIKON.  Canon has thought of every thing.  I guess the first thing I like about the camera is its small size.  Even in the Canon case (optional but get it when you order the camera), it fits inside my shirt pocket.  Don't let the small size fool you though.  Response time is quick between shots, the LCD display is clear and very easy to view, even in high sunlight conditions.  Setting between Auto and Manual modes are so basic with the cameras control switch. The menus are well laid out - you won't feel like you need a PHD from MIT to understand the controls.  The camera is also capable of taking pretty decent short time AVI movies all at the flick of a switch on top of the camera.  It also comes with sound (note, sound only playable on your PC).  When I downloaded the movie file to my PC I was amazed at the quality of it.    

I have had some problems with indoor shots - some tend to be washed out.  I plan on checking the Canon user forum and get some tips on resolving the problem - i.e., try shooting some pics in manual mode, lowering the exposure value, etc.  

All I can say about this camera is that I love it.  I have used it so much more than my Nikon.. it sure is a lot easier to lug around and I am amazed at the quality of pictures.
