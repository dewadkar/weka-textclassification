            The fall of September 2000, was advancing fast on me, and I knew that my little 1991 Mercury Tracer would never be able to handle a return trip to Florida.
In addition to my own luggage and things I also had to had plenty of room for those of my Mom who would be going back to Florida with me.

I looked around for several weeks, checking out small pickups, with caps and extended cabs.  Didn't seem to be what I wanted. 
I looked at station wagons, but I thought they would probably use too much gas, and I also wanted something that would let me sit fairly high off the ground so I could have a better view while traveling on the highway.

After many trips to the auto dealers, I was about to give up on the search for a bit.
Then I saw it. I turned around after looking at an extended cab pickup and there it was. The answer to my problems. It was a 1997 RAV4. 
It answered every requisite I had. The next trial would be the comfort of driving.

The salesman came over and we discussed the features that I needed in a car. He totally agreed with me that this RAV4 would be the ideal vehicle for me. 
In addition to the space, the comfort of driving, the height of the seats and the all around looks of the car, it was good with gas as well.
There I had it, the perfect answer to my problems.

We took it for a spin and that clenched my decision. I was very comfortable driving it.

I had wanted an automatic vehicle, but this one happened to be a standard and by this time I wasn't that concerned about the shifting difference.

I received a very good trade for the Tracer, and I drove my TOY home the next day.
I am sure that my upcoming trip to FLORIDA will be so much easier now that I have the vehicle for me.

I would recommend this TOY to anyone looking for a good small SUV with space for luggage etc; and comfort as well. It handles extremely well, and is a joy to drive.
