            I really have only a little to say about this camera.  First off, the pictures it takes are excellent.  Everything and more you could and should expect from a company like Kodak.  

The camera offers a variety of picture qualities and compression ratios, and a ton of other options as well.  The camera is relatively small and easy to carry, and it looks stylish, too.

The negative aspects of the camera are in the battery consumption and in the time it takes to store the picture on the disc.  I go through so many batteries.  It is well worth it to pick up some rechargeables and maybe an AC power cord (not included) for the wall.  Also, it is impossible to &quot;rapid-shoot&quot; any pictures.  The camera just takes way to long for that.  Still it is only 4-6 seconds depending on the compression settings.  One minor issue, the only thing else to say, is about the viewfinder.  I think it is a little off.  When you see the screen, it is accurate.  But the viewfinder is bit off.  Use the screen wisely, however, or you'll be buying more batteries than ever.<br><br>
