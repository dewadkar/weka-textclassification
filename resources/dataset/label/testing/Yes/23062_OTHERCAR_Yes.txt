            I did a lot of research over the internet before buying my digital camera.  Mainly I was planning on using it for listing auction items on eBay.  I opted for the Polaroid pdc-640 because of the low price and number of features it offered for that low price.  I bought my camera at Walmart for $169 (tax not included).


  It is extremely easy to use.  I am not one for reading instructions, so it was a snap to use right out of the package.  Picture quality is great for listing items on online auctions (640 X 480 resolution).  If you are looking for a digital camera to use for all your picture taking needs (family photos, etc), than this may not be the camera for you.  When pictures are blown up, the quality is not there.  I would recommend a resolution of say 1020 X 1600 for those needs.  Of course a camera with a higher resolution will cost considerably more also.



 This camera has 3 different flash modes, a 1.8 inch lcd monitor, and stores 96 images in low resolution, 36 images in medium resolution, 24 images in high resolution, and 12 images in super high resolution.  It comes with a 2 mb memory card which can be upgraded to an 8 mb card for more storage.


 Photos are downloaded via a serial cable that plugs into the back of your home computer (in the serial port).  It does not take long at all to download the photos.  Besides taking 4 AA batteries the camera comes with an AC adapter.  This comes in very handy when downloading photos to save your batteries. I recommend buying some rechargeable batteries (NiMh) w/ a charger (cost me $15 off ebay), since digital cameras w/ lcd's drain batteries quickly!


 Other noteworthy features include:  1.  3 focus ranges (Macro, Close up, and Normal)   2.  Self Timer   3.  Tripod Mountable   4.  Date and time stamp 


I would like to add that I did have a problem with the serial cable not working properly.  I was having problems downloading photos onto my computer.  This happened a little over a month after buying the camera.  Well, I took the camera into Walmart to see if they could either get me another serial cable or give me instructions on how to send it in for warranty work.  And walla!  They exchanged my camera and all accessories for a new one.  Just goes to show you that where you buy your camera is an important decision also. <br><br>
