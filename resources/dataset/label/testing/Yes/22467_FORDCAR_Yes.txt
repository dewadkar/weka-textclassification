            For the cost, this is a good truck.  I would recommend this trcuk to anyone who needs a utility vehicle to conatin large objects.  This is not a particularly good truck for towing, because it has a very weak I-4 engine.  The main appeal of this trcuk is the price and the utilty use of it.  This makes for a great maintenance vehicle, because it has a great bed in the back for holding numerous things, but it can't be too heavy because of the tiny engine.  this is truly the baby of pickup trucks, and would be great for light utility use.<br><br>
