            It seems strange to write a review of a car that is fast approaching 11 years old, but as I passed my reliable old friend in the driveway today, I felt compelled to sing its praises in public.  After 8 years of unbeatable performance, I figured I owed it at least that much.

This car was a graduation present for me in 1992.  My dad had remembered how much I loved the Storm when it first came out in 1990, and also heard me say how I didn't like the spoiler on the 1992 model, so he found me a great white 1990 model with only 15K miles.  I was in heaven!  If you're not familiar with the history of the Storm, it was first manufactured in 1990 for Geo by Isuzu.  The model was discontinued in 1993 when Isuzu stopped making cars and went strictly to trucks and SUVs.  And what a shame.

The best thing about this car, for me, has always been its looks.  People can't believe that it's a 10 year old car when I tell them.  Its style is very similar to that of the current Saturn 2 door, but sportier.  It will likely remain a new looking car for quite some time!  And with no particular care, not even more than a sporadic waxing, the finish has retained its shine even in the North Carolina sun.

Although not quite Corvette-like, I always feel like I am driving a much bigger-engined sports car.  It has plenty of pep and acceleration, and is certainly low enough to the ground!  It has picked up a minor rattle or two over the years, but that's to be expected with age, no?  The backseat is not particularly roomy, as with most 2 door cars, but fold down the back seat and you've got a huge space for hauling things that are too big to fit in the backseat or trunk of other cars.

I'm not a huge American car fan, so I'm attributing its outstanding reliability to its Japanese creators.  This car has had no trouble over the years and hasn't been in the shop outside of a clutch replacement (which was probably due to too many people learning to drive a manual on it!).  In fact, the only reason I purchased a new car was the fact that this was going on 10 years old.

I'm sad to admit that this car has now become a car for hauling mulch, TVs, and other things that we don't want to mess up the other cars.  But each time I get in and start it up, sometimes after weeks or months of no use, I smile to myself as it turns over first time, readying itself for its next job!  As a matter of fact, we've been meaning to sell this car for over a year, but I don't really have the heart to put the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign in the window.  I guess you can become attached to a car...<br><br>
