            I bought my <b>1995 Mercury Villager</b> on January 2, 1999.  We missed having a mini-van; our <i>1990 Dodge Grand Caravan</i> had been totaled out in the flooding around the Tennessee area in February of 1997, and we thought we wanted a car, so we bought a <i>Chevrolet Cavalier</i>.

After traipsing around in a small car for a couple of years, having one baby, and another on the way, we were ready to go back to a mini-van.

We spent a few days looking once we made the decision to move back up, and finally settled on either a <i>Nissan Quest</i> or a <b>Mercury Villager</b>.  A few more days of looking and we found our van, a <b>1995 Mercury Villager</b> GS, grey.

We purchased the van with 56,000 miles on it, something I *thought* we would regret, and now, 4 years later, I haven't regretted it for an instant.

We drove the van in Hawaii from January of 1999 until November of 2000, and then we drove it from California to Florida in December 2000.  (We're a military family :-)

My husband went overseas for a while, and I had to drive the children 13 miles each way to and from school, twice a day.  I rapidly piled on the miles, but never had any problems with the van.

In June 2001, my father-in-law passed away, necessitating me to drove from Florida to New York alone with my two youngest children, both under the age of 3 at the time.  Obviously I wanted the van in tip-top shape for the trip of over 1300 miles, so I had the air conditioning and transmission serviced (small leak was found in the A/C system at that point), and had a C/V axle replaced.  I believe the van was at about 105,000 miles then.

My <b>Villager</b> made the trip with no problems, along with a return trip of almost 2000 miles due to having to take care of my father-in-laws final wishes.

In November 2001, at approximately 125,000 miles, I did the routine service (which was probably overdue by then) of changing out the timing belt and serpentine belt (and whatever else was recommended at that mileage interval), had the other C/V axle replaced.  While being serviced, they discovered a hole (it looked like a bullet hole, to be honest) in my water pump, so I had it replaced.

In January 2003, I noticed the van beginning to make a strange noise under the hood, but, being me, I stalled for weeks on getting it checked out.  My husband thought it was the power steering pump going out, but, of course, I didn&#146t believe him J  I finally took it into a mechanic in early February and found it was the lower pressure hose leaking on the power steering pump, and he also recommended I replace my top radiator hose.  I paid $20.75 for the power steering hose, and $9.99 for the radiator hose and replaced them myself.

That is ALL the work I have had to have done on my 1995 Mercury <b>Villager</b>.  She has proven to be an extremely reliable van for my family.  I do semi-routine oil changes, somewhere between every 3000 and 8000 miles, and I check my fluids regularly.  I DO have a small oil leak from (I may say this incorrectly, I&#146ve forgotten exactly what the mechanic said) from my lower engine seal.  When I have to replace it, it will require removing the transmission.  So far, though, it is a small leak, I see no drops in my driveway, and my oil is never low when I check it.

After reading all this, I&#146m sure you are wondering if there is anything &#147bad&#148 about this van.  Well, in one word, no.  YES, there are things I don&#146t like about it, but they are not the fault of the van, mechanically, she has been GREAT!

My &#147cons&#148 about my <b>1995 Mercury Villager</b>:

1.	It&#146s too small.  We have four children, and until we got out of the stroller days, I cursed the size EVERY DAY.  (Please note, I ALWAYS used a double stroller, USUALLY a double jogging stroller&#133..my <i><a href="/kifm-review-72FC-1904B9B-38953ABB-prod4">Graco Duo Glider</a></i> fit in the cargo area MUCH easier, but still did not leave much room)  Now, though, it is a good size for us, I DO sometimes wish it was bigger, but it definitely meets our family&#146s needs now that we no longer use a stroller.  I am able to do a month&#146s grocery trip all at once, WITH all four kids, and have no problem fitting people and groceries in the van.

2.	Automatic seatbelts in the front seat make me NUTS!!!!  UGH!  They are forever closing before I sit completely in my seat, and &#147choke&#148 me, LOL.

3.	The seatbelts in general tangle easily and get jammed.  I thought my rear seatbelt was broken at one point, ordered a new one ($100!!!), and when it came in, it turned out the dealership had ordered the wrong side.  The body shop guy had already taken apart the existing seatbelt, so he checked it out, and found that it had twisted when it retracted and jammed.  My kids probably caused it, but it was a bear to untangle, LOL.

4.	It doesn&#146t have rear A/C and heat.  I knew that when I bought it, the next van I buy will have rear climate control.

5.	Only has one sliding door.  Again, something I knew when I bought it, another thing I cursed every time I had to climb into the van to strap a baby in a carseat.  My next van will have dual sliding doors!

6.	The rear seat doesn&#146t come out.  Something else I knew, a feature I miss that my <i>Grand Caravan</i> had.  With the middle seat removed, and the rear seat slid completely forward, I can put my 15 cubic foot deep freezer completely inside the van and close the liftgate.  IF I could take out the rear seat, too, I&#146d have another 20&#148 or so of space, BUT!  I have to admit, that sliding rear seat is MUCH easier to deal with than lugging seats in and out of the <i>Grand Caravan</i>.  The middle seat is a little heavy and very bulky to put in and out alone, but I&#146ve done it a hundred times at least, so it is manageable.

7.	The rear radio controls.  They are right where little fingers can reach them, and thus change the radio station, or mute the entire sound system, LOL.  To my knowledge, there is no way to disable those controls.


The PROS!:

1.	VERY reliable:  I&#146ve already expounded on this above, but I cannot say it enough.  Every time I take the van in for a check-up or oil change, the mechanics shake their heads and say, &#147It&#146s got a <i>Nissan</i> engine.&#148  We&#146re currently at 160,000 , and still going strong.

2.	Radio.  The factory radio (AM/FM/Cassette in my van) automatically turns itself down when you shut the vehicle off.  This is great for those of us who are the stereo-typical soccer mom, almost always have kids in the vehicle with you, and when you get to go out WITHOUT the kids, you blast the radio J  I always forget to turn the volume down when I get out, but it does it for me.

3.	Nice ride.  It&#146s a comfortable ride.  I&#146ll admit, coming cross-country, I sure didn&#146t think so, but when you figure you have 6 persons&#146 worth of luggage, paraphernalia, a double jogging stroller, and souvenirs in the van, I think just about any mini-van would be a little cramped, LOL.  The trip to New York, she was the dream ride.  I drove 30 hours straight on that trip, and other than being exhaust4ed from lack of sleep, I can&#146t complain about the ride.

4.	Safe.  There are anchor points for tethered carseats behind all three rear seating positions, and you can use the 3rd row seat belts as anchors for a tether in a 2nd row seating position.  Obviously, you cannot tether a carseat in the 2nd row if you have people riding in all 3 seats in the 3rd row.  Driver airbag, no passenger airbag J  (I HATE airbags, I&#146m short, and afraid of being beheaded should one ever deploy in front of me.  I drive with the seat ALL the way back, just to be as far as possible from the airbag.)

5.	Rear window.  It can be opened without opening the entire liftgate.  I LOVE that when I have $500 worth of groceries.  When they start to pile up, I close the gate and open the window and put the rest in that way.  It allows me to get all the groceries behind the seats, and not have to put them in the center section of the van.

All in all, I LOVE my van.  Our next planned vehicle purchase is a <i>Honda Odyssey</i>.  When I still lugged a huge stroller around constantly, I wanted that <i>Odyssey</i>.  Now&#133.nope, my husband will drive it, I&#146m sticking with my <b>Villager</b> until it cannot drive another mile!
