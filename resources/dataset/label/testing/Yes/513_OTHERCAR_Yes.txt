            I've used about 4 different digital cameras over the last four years, ranging from the horrible to the pretty good.  Until this week I was quite happy with a Sony Mavica with the 10x optical zoom - a must for the way I shoot.

I finally decided that the limits of floppy disks were too great so it became time to replace the Mavica for everyday use though I'll keep it for loaning to my students.  That led me to as thorough a search as I could make of ePinions and the various magazines I found online.  The C-2100 Ultra Zoom sounded pretty good.  Fortunately I had a chance to hold it at a local store - I'd never recommend spending this much money on a camera without seeing how it feels in the hand.

I liked what I saw so I looked on the net and found it for $200 less than the store - too much to ignore though I like dealing with real people.  

What I find after using it for a week is that it's truly a splendid piece of machinery, one that I'd recommend to anyone who values the zoom capability.  Here are some facts and then some opinions.

FACTS (Look at the Olympus web site for lots of specs)
-  Only for right-handed people
-  4 AA Ni-MH batteries take about 100 pictures including downloading it to the computer.
-  No case comes with the camera, but a battery charger and batteries do.  I had a hard time determining this from the online info.
- There are 4 jpeg resolutions available, ranging from 640x480 to 1260x960 + TIFF from 1600x1200 to 640x480.  Of course TIFF eats LOTS of memory.
- The camera comes with a limited remote control device - primarily for snapping pictures of yourself it appears.
- Effective minimum f-stop is 2.8 - at least that's what it shows.
- Time between single exposures is about 2 seconds.

OPINIONS
- Very well balanced in the hand
- Offers almost any level of control one can think of - though remembering how to navigate the menu to some of the unusual ones (like automatic exposure bracketing) can be daunting.
- Flash works very well at short and longer distances.
- The stabilization system works quite well - most of the time.  There's a delay before it kicks in and I've had some blurred shots.
- Note that I rate ease of use as "excellent".  That's because you can truly do point-and-shoot without worrying about all the fancy stuff if that's what you want.

WHAT I MISS
- A battery meter that would allow me to know how many additional exposures I'm likely to get.


WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO BUY IN ADDITION
- At least one 32MB SmartMedia card - gives 64 images (actually more like 70)in HQ mode.  It's a bit hard to interpret the manual, but I think this is the 1024x768 mode.  I'm actually springing for a 128MB card.  Note that the Olympus brand is the only one that promises you that you can stitch together panoramas.
-  A camera case.
