            In May of 2002 we started the hunt for a new vehicle since the lease was to expire on our 2000 GMC Jimmy.  Previously, we had leased a 1996 and a 1998 GMC Jimmy and when my wife decided she wanted to purchase the <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i> I was a bit disappointed.  Not that any of the three vehicles gave us anything complain about, on the contrary, they were all very reliable vehicles.  My biggest complaint about the three previous purchases stemmed from the fact that the 2000 was a twin of both the 1998 and 1996 and I was becoming weary of the style.  It was my assumption the <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i> was another 1996 Jimmy with a new nameplate.  Nothing could be further from the truth...

<b>Ride and Comfort</b>

From the moment I first sat in the vehicle, it became obvious GMC, had indeed, done a remodel job.  Both my wife and myself were immediately struck by the increased room the interior of the Envoy had to offer.  Since this is the vehicle she usually drives, she sat in the driver's side and as I got in on the passenger side we found we were not sitting elbow to elbow as we previously did in our Jimmy.

As our test drive progressed, we were also both extremely impressed with the ride.  Again, we had little to complain about with our previous GMC models but the ride of the <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i> is smoothed with the A-Arm/Torsion Bar suspension and Michelin P245/65R17 All-Season tires.  The ride is further enhanced by the addition of Bilstein shock absorbers, all standard.

The seats on the vehicle we purchased are fully appointed in leather(optional) and come with standard 8-Way Power driver seat.  Both the driver and passenger seats are equipped with standard power lumbar support as well as power reclining capability.  

Your comfort is also increased with standard dual zone air conditioning although I have to admit it will take some reading and trial and error to get it right.  The vehicle has a number of cup holders and map pockets as well as both a roof-overhead and armrest console with storage.  The driver will find the cup holder arrangement a bit awkward while on the road and this storage is still at a minimum.  These may be one the only flaws in the design of this vehicle.  Some additional goodies you will find standard on these vehicles are cruise/speed control, AM/FM ETR Stereo with CD, stainless steel exhaust, power windows and door locks, intermittant wipers-front and back, tilt/leather steering wheel, full spare tire, luggage rack, HomeLink universal transmitter and remote keyless entry.  I could go on from here but it suffices to say most any option you could consider is standard in this vehicle.  We did add the sunroof and heated front seats as an options on our purchase.

<b>Safety</b>

The new <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i> comes with both driver and passenger depowered airbags, as well as side impact airbags as standard equipment.  Also standard, are power 4-wheel disc brakes with 4-wheel ABS.  Additionally, the side impact door beams and energy absorbing steering column will offer much needed protection should the unfortunate happen and the vehicle is involved in a wreck.

I'll consider the OnStar Communications System as a safety feature on this vehicle.  You will receive one year free OnStar service with the Safe and Sound package.  After the first year you will be charged 199.00 per year should you so desire.  The package includes:

� Emergency Assistance Services
� Notification of airbag deployment
� Accident assistance
� Roadside assistance
� Stolen vehicle tracking
� Remote door lock
� Remote diagnostics
� Remote vehicle alert: (horn and light activation)
� Online concierge services
� OnStar MED-NET (additional $12.00 annual)

The heavy duty battery with rundown protection may offer some protection from finding yourself, or more importantly, your wife and kids from being stranded in a dangerous situation.

Also included is the central locking system with auto/speed sensitive door locks.  This will assure locks are on while the vehicle is in motion.  This feature is a annoyance in our old Oldsmobile because upon exiting the vehicle, one will always have to unlock the doors.  This is not the case here, locks are automatically unlocked when the vehicle is placed in park.  Of course also standard, as for some years now, are child safety locks. 

<b>Power and Drivetrain</b>

The new <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i> comes standard with the Vortec 4.2L 6 Cylinder 270 hp gas engine.  It will most assuredly provide you enough power on the highway, even in passing situations.  With the increased size and weight of this vehicle, owners of previous GMC products such as ourselves notice a decrease in fuel economy.

The drivetrain is a 4-speed, electronically controlled automatic overdrive transmission.  In the three months we have been driving the vehicle, it has performed admirably.  No hesitation points anywhere on acceleration from a dead stop.

<b>Value and Recommendation</b>

The <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i> is a real nice vehicle with a wide range of standard features one may find as a options on other choices.  The Envoy we ended up with is very well appointed and will hopefully be as reliable as the past three GMC purchases we have made in the past.  That being said, be prepared to end up with a monthly payment in the $430.00 to $450.00 range with a 12,000/3 year lease.  

I do find myself recommending that you take the time to check out the <i>2002 GMC Envoy</i>.  Even though your choice may be a vehicle other than this, it would be well worth your time to, at least, consider this one as an option.
