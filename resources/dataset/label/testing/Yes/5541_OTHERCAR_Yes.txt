            I've had my Tahoe LS for about a year now.  I bought it from a friend of mine in my hometown who's dad fixes up wrecked vehicles for a living and sells them back to the public.  This was such a vehicle.  It only got hit in the back with a few minor bruises up front, but still a lot to fix.  He fixed it, and sold it to my parents who gave it to me as a graduation present.  It's a college car for me, and am I glad I got it!  My model had 27K miles on it (that was BEFORE my first road trip.)

This truck has a lot of things to gloat about!  First off, not just everybody has one of these babies.  Oh sure, you see the four door models everywhere, but you can't always spot the sportier (and better looking) 2DRs.  It's only for a select few, and with it's good looks, you'll really stand out.  The exterior is classic, yes, and when placed next to today's more curvy SUVs, may be deemed boring.  But hey, what do you want out of a vehicle?  A curvy exterior may get a few more stares, but I'm sure you paid for it.  For those of you who like that classic Chevy look (like me of course!), you won't be disappointed here.

The drive in the Tahoe is relatively smooth, with only a few rattles from the inside and, yes, the occasional squeaking from underneath, but nothing a few well placed wadded up scraps of paper and a lube job can't fix (what do you want from me?  I'm in college for crying out loud!).  The seats are extremely comfortable (mine are cloth), especially on long drives, such as the one from Denton to home, which is roughly 5 or 6 hours, depending on traffic and the grace of God.  Mine is equipped with lumbar support, so I never complain of backaches.  The seats, once again, are comfortable, even cushy, so that pesky butt-falling-asleep feeling is positively absent.  You sit high, with a commanding view of the road, which is GREAT for spying cops on I-20 before they spy you.  Of course, if you have a radar detector, you can really enjoy this baby!  A lot of people accuse the Tahoe's drive of not being "car-like" enough.  To these people I say:  

HELLO!  IT'S A TRUCK!  Yeesh.

The sound system on my Tahoe consists of a CD player, AM/FM radio, and cassette deck.  Since I despise listening to the radio, and because of the fact that I own no tapes that do not involve The Chipmunks, I usually just trade CDs in and out.  Despite it's constant use, absolutely no problems whatsoever have resulted with the sound system, and I'm in my truck a lot, so it gets used!  All the controls are easily reached, read, and perfectly workable.  A toddler could figure this out folks.  I find that the SVC (speed volume control) works especially well when rocketing down the interstate with both windows down.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Clause.  

A word on power.  This truck's got it!  Mine is equipped with a huge V8.  I'm not sure it comes in any other engine size, nor should it.  That would be downright insulting.  This baby has ample power and good acceleration, not making you feel like a slug at ANY time and giving you an ego the size of Martha Stewart's so you can politely roll down your window and laugh maniacally at the pathetic little roadsters that try to pass you.  Although the truck is big, it's not overwhelming, but it's big enough to bulldoze any and all pedestrians that get in your way (BWA HAHAHAHAHA!).    

On cargo room and general roominess, this truck can swallow more stuff than Roseanne at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, which is really handy when you're transporting things to and from home, as well as hauling a truckload of friends around Dallas.  Good luck finding Waldo in this thing!  The back lift gate opens with no problems and with the tailgate down and the glass up, it's extremely easy to load almost anything.  On head and leg room and what not, I'm 6ft, and I'm able to fit comfortably in the driver's seat with room to spare.  I have a friend who is 6ft 2in (a girl no less) who can sit in the back seat also very comfortably.  The only problem here is getting in and out.  My friend always tells me it's like being born again.  She's such a card.  

The only problems I have come across so far with this otherwise great truck is some the minor noises and problems with my brakes.  Didn't take much to fix though.  It's also a gas hog, but it really doesn't matter when your parents are picking up the bill!  I'm sure that when they slap me with the responsibility for the gas bill that it will take quite a chunk, but, it's a living!  Unless I win the lotto or something...

I really enjoy this truck, and you won't be disappointed either.  Recently I've had the U-Joint replaced, which wasn't too pricey, thanks to the fact that our mechanic is also my uncle.  Other than that, I've had the truck over a year, and nothing else has ever gone wrong!  It's just amazing really, especially considering the way I drive! 

I had a cop pull me over the other day and tell me that I was scaring the pedestrians.  If you don't like the way I drive, get out of the hallway!  :)
