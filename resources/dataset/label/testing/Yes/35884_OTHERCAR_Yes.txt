            I bought a Jeep because I wanted to haul kids and stuff around...but NOT in a van!  I had the typical first year problems - the AC went out on a 1000 mile trip, I busted an axle taking a u-turn, the emission system clacked at about 15,000 miles.  However, the service I received was Excellent, and the &quot;truck&quot; has held up well over the past four years.  

My Cherokee is a five-speed, which I recommend to anyone over the automatic.  The steering is smooth - the only problem I have is that it is a rather noisy vehicle - don't try to have a conversation going 55 miles an hour.  Also, put bigger tires on your Jeep the first time you need them - you'll get a better grip on the road, especially if it is raining.

I also found out, via my teenage son, that the bumpers don't hold up past 2 miles an hour.  Get yourself some steel rollbars for about $300 from an independent source (not the dealer).  You'll be glad you did.<br><br>
