             I purchased my first Chrysler Sebring LXI a year ago because I liked the <b>body style</b> , it looks like a sporty luxury car. The front end is low and shaped like a sports car. The back end is high and has the shape of a  luxury car. Also I have three children and I like 2 door compact cars and most sporty 2 door automobiles only seat four when the Sebring seats five. I loved how this car drives smooth and has excellent pick up. The interior and exterior is excellent. 

My car does have a <b>power sunroof</b> not the convertible top. This car is great with or without the added top features.

 The <b>trunk space</b> in this car is excellent it comes with a cargo net.

The <b>back seats</b> do go down. In which if you needed to carry something long you could put it through the trunk
into the back of the car.

<b>Interior</b> is leather(comes in clothe to) I love it because if my children spill something it wipes up easily. And for height I am 5'11 and I fit comfortably in it.

<b>Stereo system</b> is a awesome stock stereo system (Infinity) there is no need to replace for sound. It is equipped with a stock equalizer.

A nice <b>added extra</b> for those who have a electric garage door opener, there is a built in button on the drivers visor for a universal garage door opener.

The <b>gas mileage</b> is 19 miles city and 27 miles highway.

 As for <b>durability</b>, I recently was in a bad accident with my first Chrysler Sebring LXI that resulted in a total of my auto. Although my auto was totaled my three children and I were fine not a scratch on us.
Do to the fact that I already Loved all the features and everything the Chrysler Sebring had to offer and not to mention the impact the car can take,I purchased a 2000 Chrysler Sebring LXI.

 There are two <b>new features</b> on my car now,  one is a brake light that is in the middle on my trunk, this light flashes when I press on my brakes to get the attention of the driver behind you. The other feature is a compass on my rear view mirror.


I feel if you like sporty and luxury this car is a perfect choice.
