            I bought one of these babies new in March 1998. It's been my pride and joy since. The VR6 model (then dubbed the GLX) of the Jetta is the top of the line, and I sprang for everything but leather interior. It came standard with power windows, sunroof, CD player, air-conditioning, 15" alloy rims, and fog lights. 

Ergonomics: they're first-rate. Lots of leg room, front and rear. This car is TALL. My friend's first comment on sitting in it: "wow, it's like you're in a greenhouse." Visibility in this car is better than ANY other car on the road, bar none. And the trunk is HUGE! It's bigger than a Cadillac's, I swear. I've put TONS of stuff in the back of it, luggage for myself, my sister, and my brother-in-law before a trip to India. It fit with no worries or hassles, and there was still room in the cabin. :-)

Engine: My favorite. The VR6 is a torquey and reliable little monster. It's a 2.8L narrow angle engine, which means it takes up less room under the hood. It's optimized for torque (172 foot pounds at peak), which means it's strong off the line, and a lot of fun in "normal" driving conditions. Peak horsepower is around 180, but is easily bumped up with a chip and intake / exhaust to over 200.

Ride / Handling: This car is great for a front-wheel drive car. Understeer is noticeable, but minimal and easily handled. ABS prevents power slides (oh well), but you can get around this with the gas pedal instead of the brake
 :-) Ride is a little stumbly and the suspension can get unsettled on bumpy pavement, and the car leans a lot, although it still maintains GREAT traction (thanks to sticky 205/60 r15's). A suspension upgrade is a good idea, although not necessary if you just need to pick up groceries and tool around town. 

Warranty / Service: ah, here's the rub. The warranty is only 2 years / 24,000 miles. What the hell? Since 1998, VW has made great strides on warranty work, but really...this is stingy. Thankfully, I never needed it, except for one time...my car's battery died *right* at 25,000 miles, just past the free VW roadside assistance mark. I had AAA, though, so I called them, and they came and gave me a jump...which blew out my electrical controller unit. VW was reluctant to reimburse me the cost of the repair (who ever heard of putting an ECU in a circuit without a fuse in front of it?!? I mean, dumb design! Well, the car couldn't be *perfect*, I guess). After a strongly-worded letter to their HQ, I was reimbursed the cost of the repair, though, and have been motoring away happily ever since.


Overall: I love mine. Germans know how to build cars.
