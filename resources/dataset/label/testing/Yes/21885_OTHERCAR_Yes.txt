            Nearing my 50th birthday, I suddenly developed the urge to own a hot rod - not just any hot rod, but one that also combined my passion for BMW cars (total 8 owned since 1985).  I simply wanted a car with heart-pumping horsepower and a manual transmission.  I researched and road-tested a variety of BMW's in the $35K-45K range, including the E46 M3's and 330i's, and Z3 and M Coupes before settling on a a very low mileage 2000 E39 540i 6 speed.  Car and Driver magazine had rated the E39 5 series (1997-2003) in its Top Ten awards for several years running, so this is a car that has received notable recognition for its engineering and performance.  

The 540i has simply been a blast to drive, compared to my relatively pedestrian '95 525i which currently serves as my daily driver.  Equipped with a 4.4-liter alloy block 32-valve V8 engine that produces 282 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, the 6-speed model races from 0-60 in 5.5 seconds according to the magazine reviews.  With plenty of torque on hand, passing at freeway speeds is easily accomplished in 5th gear without the need to downshift to 4th.  6th gear is strictly a cruising gear, albeit at speeds above the legal speed limit, but at 85 mph, it allows the engine to loaf at about 2700 RPM.  Gas economy is typically 18-19 mpg in mixed city and freeway driving, and 24 mpg on the open highway (although I tend to drive very aggressively, so YMMV).  The shift from 1st to 2nd on the manual gearbox is somewhat notchy, due to a clutch delay valve deployed by BMW to dissuade middle-aged baby boomers from granny shifting the 6-speed transmission.  So far, this problem hasn't bothered me, but there is aftermarket high performance replacement part available.  The M-Technic performance suspension of the 540i lends itself to aggressive cornering, which it does marvelously, but the combination of suspension, power, and weight (3800 lbs) will likely lead to early tire wear.  Fellow BMW Club owners have told me not to expect more than 30K miles of use from the OEM 235/45-17 Continental Contacts.  

The exterior of the car is normal BMW fare and is very appealing, especially compared to the upcoming and very ugly 2005 5-series designed by Chris Bangle (see Z4 and 745i).  My car is equipped with self-leveling bi-xenon headlights and illuminates the roadway better than my ellipsoid halogen equipped 525i.  As a luxo-performance car, my 540i is equipped with most gizmos, but lacks the navigation system (if you absolutely need a nav system, go look at the Nissan or Infiniti offerings), and the Harmon Kardon DSP (digital sound processor) and has a trunk-mounted 6 disc CD changer instead of the dash-mounted single CD player.  So long as I have Mapquest and the purring sounds of my V8 engine, I'm not missing these features.  The standard 8 speaker sound system works and sounds more than adequate.

The interior of 540i is equipped with electronically adjustable sports seats covered in Nappa leather.  These seats are harder and narrower than the standard BMW 5 series seats and may be somewhat less comfortable for larger sized people.  The seats in my old 525i are definitely softer around the butt area.  However, the 540i sports seats have larger side bolsters and an adjustable knee support which allows the passengers to tailor their seating positions accordingly.  Airbags abound in this vehicle including front air bags, front head bags, and side airbags front and rear.  The rear seats are a little tight for 3 adults, but very comfortable for 2.  Keep in mind that the E39 is really a mid-size vehicle and not conducive to hauling 5 adults.  Trunk space is also limited at 11.1 cubic ft., especially compared to my old E34 525i which seems almost a third larger.  The CD changer which previously hung underneath the rear window shelf was relocated to the space behind the left wheel well in the E39 models.  This cuts down the width of trunk and golf bags must now be placed into the trunk diagonally instead of straight across from left to right.  There is a diagram attached to the trunk lid showing how to load 3 golf bags into the trunk, but it only works with small, lightweight golf bags, not the large staff bags.  But on a recent trip, I managed to stuff 2-26" rollaways, 2 large duffel bags, 2 daypacks, and 1 garment bag into the trunk with room to spare.  One additional note - the E39 M5 has no spare tire, but is instead equipped with run-flat tires which are useless in the event of a sidewall puncture.  All other 5 series cars come with a full size spare mounted on a matching alloy rim.  

What solidified my selection really came down to financing.  Pre-owned BMW's are a very attractive purchase when considering the extended warranty provided by BMW, low financing rates, and resale value.  I paid $41,000 for somewhat rare 3 year old 2000 540i 6 speed with 32,400 miles that originally had a $58,000 list price when new.  I financed it a 3.9% over 72 months.  BMW paid for the first 2 payments, plus I received a $500 loyalty check from BMW for being an active member of the BMW owners club.  The pre-owned certification checklist showed the car received new tires, new front brakes, and all filters and fluids were changed.  Going the pre-owned route is the best way to purchase a clean, late model car, regardless if it is a BMW, Lexus, or Benz.  And it is definitely a great way to go when finding the Uber Ultimate Driving Machine, which for me is a 540i 6 speed.
