               Although I do not own this car, I had the exciting experience of riding with my counsins in his 1996 Infinti I30 when I visited them over the summer.  As soon as I saw this car, I thought to my myself, &quot;He paid HOW MUCH for that?!?.&quot;  After spending 3 weeks at my counsins' house mostly crusing in his I30 I have nothing but praise for this near perfect machine.  

Price:  When he told me how much he paid for this car I was amazed.  He paid $14,000 for a 4 year old car with only about 62,000 miles on the car.  And this car is not the base model, it is the top of line touring model and fully loaded.  Compare that to other cars in its class.  I know for a fact that 1996 BMW 328i still cost about $19500-$21000 used, a 1996 goes for about $19000-$22000, and a Audi A4 2.8 goes for $16000-$18000.

Equipment:  The I30 gives you so much.  Standard leather tirm of very high quality and comfortable.  Standard spoiler, standard chrome rims, and an aggressive chrome front grille give this car a mean look.  The stero system is excellent and well amp. This car has a standard sunroof, something you would have to pay extra on a C280 or 328I.  On top of all this, the Infinti comes with a standard 5 speed tranny, giving the car a sporty feel and incredible punch off the line.

Performance and Sound:  This car is FAST for a sedan!  During my time with my cousins, we had a nice encounter with a saab viggen.  Yep, a 230HP turbocharged 2 Door Saab Viggen.  Before people starting thinking I'm making this up, let me say that my counsin is an excellent 5 speed driver and this person compared to him was only average.  We met at a redlight and he started to rev his car.  We took off and through the entire time, I heard almost nothing from the outside.  The only noise was the engine noise, which wasn't really that loud.  My counsin quickly took the advantage at about 30 mph and we never saw the back of the Viggen again.  

Reliably:  This car is made by Nissan.  Nissan has a proven track record of reliably and stacks up with Toyota and Honda concerning reliably.  Infintis are also cheap to repair compared to its european competitors like Mercedes and BMW.  On top of that Infinti has one of the nicest, most caring dealerships and sales staff that you will ever meet.

Probably the worst thing about Infintis is that there resale value is really poor compared to Audi, Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.  This is the reason why they are so cheap used.  However, if you know you are going to keep this car, then this is as affordable true luxury can get<br><br>
