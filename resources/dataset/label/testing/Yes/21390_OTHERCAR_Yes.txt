            I am the proud owner of a new 1999 Camry XLE ..... loaded 4 cylinder. This is the fifth Toyota I have owned (third Camry) and I have decided that I am wasting my time visiting any other dealer when it comes time to purchase a new vehicle. The ride rivals that of the Lexus E300, the car is built with incredible attention to detail, it is very peppy for a 4 cylinder but I wasn't surprised (one of my former Camrys was a 6 cylinder ..... the other two were 4 cylinders) because I find it difficult to detect any major difference between the 4 and 6 cylinders with the exception of the gas mileage. The only derogatory comment I can make about my Camry is that it is still rather lacking on driver roominess (I am 6'3&quot; 255 lbs) although this one is better than my 1994.
Driving is a pleasure whether it is short trips or long distance marathons. The steering is very responsive and the suspension is unrivaled in it's class. This Camry is for anyone who desires superior quality and economy for a very fair price. Anyone looking for a Saturday night hotrod would be advised to go elsewhere ..... even with a 6 cylinder engine. <br><br>
