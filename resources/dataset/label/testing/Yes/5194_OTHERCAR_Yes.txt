            We got our Honda Accord Coupe (4 cyl.)in March of 1998.  Once we laid our eyes on it, there was no question to which car we were going to buy.  We were car shopping in hopes of finding an affordable sedan, but once we saw this black beauty being detailed at the dealership, there was no turning back.  Although I would've liked to have bought the speedier 6 cylinder, at the time there were very few of these cars to choose from and it would've been several thousand more to get the V6.

We bought the accord with no fear of faults in quality with the outstanding background that Honda cars have had over the years.  So far it's been holding up.  We are at about 50,000 miles as of right now, and there has been no trouble at all with it.  It runs very smooth and handles great.  The car will grab the road and hug turns as much as you want it to.  Even though it's only a four-banger, it still accelerates quickly and will get up and go if you want it to.  Many times I look down at the speedometer and see that I'm going 80 mph and I didn't even notice.

It is a great road-trip car, granted that you are only traveling with two or three people.  The 4 cylinder engine gets terrific gas mileage especially when locking the cruise control on the interstate.  It seems as if the car almost drives itself sometimes on those long trips.  Opening up the sun roof lets the fresh air and sunshine come right in the car.  The stereo is adequate with an AM/FM CD Player with two sets of 6 x 9's.

In all, the car is very dependable and fun to drive and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't plan on traveling with a whole family.
