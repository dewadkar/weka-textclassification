            We were in the market for a new car as we had an addition to the family, we didn't like the min-vans, size or price. We looked at the Ford Focus Wagon and instantly fell in love with it. It is roomy like a mini-van but not as tall or as pricey. The way it looks and the way it drives makes this the best new car buying experience I have ever had. I walked away feeling satisfied and with no regrets. I believe any one with a family and a limited budget, but a high expectations on what your car should look like should look into purchasing this car. It is sporty looking but for a family.<br><br>
