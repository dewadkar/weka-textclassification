            Let me be honest.  I do not own this car.  I have a friend who is a salesman at a Toyota dealership.  Whenever I bring my car in for service, he lets me drive his company car, a 2000 Camry LE, as a loaner.

Lets start with the features:

Leather seats
Power windows, locks, mirrors, driver's seat
2-way power sunroof
remote keyless entry
alloy wheels
CD player and AM/FM cassette with the premium speaker system
2.2 4 cylinder
Automatic transmission


The outside:

In my opinion, this car is not impressive to look at.  Let's face it; the Camry is a conservative looking car.  In fact, it's downright bland styling is the only thing that is keeping me from purchasing this car.  Then why don't I purchase a Solara?  I need a car with 4 doors.

I'm sure you've all seen the Camry.  You know what it generally looks like.  I would like to add that the addition of the spoiler and fog lights and gold package certainly adds flavor to this model; however, then you'll have the price to contend with.

The interior:

Here is where you will wish you brought your spice rack.  This car exemplifies the Japanese moto:  function over form.  I must admit, the interior seems well built.  Everything is flush, nothing is hard to see, read or reach.  The power sunroof slides back with one touch of the button.  The leather seats are so comfortable if not impractical.  Of course, now your price has just hit the stratosphere.

There is nothing special about the leg room in the front or back of this car.  I would say it is the same as the other cars in its class.  The trunk room is amazing as is the head room.

The radio is very good for a factory system.  There are two extra tweeters located near the side mirrors that bring out the clarity in your music.  The bass is more than ample for those who like to shake things up without disturbing the neighbors.  I never used the tape player, but the CD player works wonderful.

The engine:

Let's not mince words here.  You are not going to get power with the 4 cylinder.  I believe the 4 cylinder puts out about 136 hp while the V6 puts out 194 hp.  There is a significant boost in acceleration with the addition of the V6; however, there is also a significant boost in the price--about $4000.  Ok, maybe not that much, but if you opt for the V6, leather and sunroof, you may opt this car right out of contention.  This car can be upwards of $27,000, or as little as $18,000 with the CE.  These prices are estimates, of course, but you get the general idea.

The 4 cylinder engine has surprising pick up.  You won't have any problems merging into 75 mph traffic.  The transmission is quiet and smooth, and the gas mileage is slightly above average.  The 4 cylinder is as quiet and smooth as the transmission.  My friend has a 1993 4 cylinder Camry, and his engine is still quiet and smooth.

I have driven the V6 on one occasion.  It is very nice.  The pick up improves drastically over its 4 cylinder little brother.  I would note that it is no faster than other cars with similar hp; however, the Camry is a 3.0 V6 which puts out as much power as Chevy's old school 3.8 V6.  I don't know what that means, but it seems as though Toyota may have slightly better technology.

Hey, can anyone tell me what the size in liters has to do with the power.  Why do different auto manufacturers put out cars with a different amount of liters but the less horsepower?  For example, why does a Corsica's 3.1 V6 put out much less hp than a Camry's 3.0 V6?  Why does a 3.5 V6 Intrepid put out more power than a 5.0 V8 Thunderbird?


How it Drives:

This car drives like you would expect.  It is not a sports car, so don't try to beat the Camero next to you.  This is a cruising car.  It swallows up the bumps without bouncing the car.  It corners as well as a sedan in its class should.  You should not buy this car if you want a sporty handling, speedy car.  You should buy this car if you want a smooth, reliable vehicle that wont's spend most of its life in the shop.

General Comments:

Anyway, I can't tell you how the Camry holds up over time, but I'm sure you've heard about their reliability.  They cost more, but their resale value is higher.

Overall a nice car if you can get around the boring styling.  I'm sorry to say that I cannot, so I guess I'll look at the Intrepids.  Don't expect to turn any heads with this car.  But you can laugh as you give your friend a ride to the Ford dealer's shop.<br><br>
