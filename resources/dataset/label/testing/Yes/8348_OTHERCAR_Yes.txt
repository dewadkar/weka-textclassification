            After trying the Agfa ePhoto Smile digital camera for $90 and not being able to get a single halfway decent picture with it, I wasn't expecting much from this Largan LMini 350 at $70 ($50 after a $20 manufacturer's rebate). 

But, you know, I was pleasantly surprised! I did specifically want a cheap digital camera to use only on certain occasions and primarily for emailing pictures. I wasn't looking to use this camera as my main camera. And most importantly, I wanted pictures that had at least OK quality. What's the point of sending pictures by email if no one can make out what's in them? 

The Largan LMini 350 meets all of my criteria. If your criteria are similar, you should be happy with the "you get what you pay for" quality of this camera. If you're planning to use it constantly as your main camera, and to print pictures, you are bound to be disappointed to some degree, because a digital camera at this price cannot approach the quality of even regular 35mm cameras. 

So, with all that said, here is a rundown of some its features:

# of pictures stored:   32 high quality or 64 normal
(keep in mind that the resolution is 640 x 480, so no pictures are truly "high" quality, but they're not bad)

Flash: On/Off/Automatic
Color: 24 bit true color
Self-Timer: yes, 10 seconds
Focusing range: 2 feet - infinity
Electronic shutter: 1/30 - 1/10000 second
Erasing: Erase ALL and Erase LAST functions
Power supply: CR123A battery or 3V AC adapter (included)
RS232 serial port link 
Automatic power shutdown after 2 minutes of inactivity, to save battery power
Comes with a camera bag, the power adapter, and photo software.

Just some final notes:

The download time for transferring photos from the camera to the PC is by serial connection, and therefore is quite slow. If you're not a heavy user, this won't be much of a problem. But if you are, you will get frustrated by the slowness.

The AC adapter is a plus because it can be used when downloading pictures, to save battery power.

The included Mr. Photo Gold software is not the most intuitive that I've ever used but it wasn't the most obscure either. 

I had no problem taking pictures with this camera. Most came out clear enough. The only thing to keep in mind (with any digital camera in this price range) is lighting. The general rules of good lighting apply even more with this camera - rules such as take pics in a well-lit room, don't point the camera at a light source because objects in front will appear very dark, pictures are easier to take outdoors, etc.
