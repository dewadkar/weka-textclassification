            Looking at my title you say well he doesn't know much about cars. Well here are my specs. I've currently drive a Lexus IS 300 and a new Chevy TrailBlazer. I've  owned 2000 Trans Am Ram Air, 3 Corvettes (85, 80 & 79), a 94 Pontiac Trans Sport SE a 73 Cadillac Fleetwood, a 68 Z-28, a 69 Road Runner, 80 Buick Skylark Limited, 87 Nissan Maxima SE. You get the picture, these were all purchased new or less than a year old. Now granted many would blow the doors off the Saturn or out class it by a mile. But what I'm saying is the '91 Saturn SC which I still own does "everything" well, not great but very well. Everything being looks, tire wear, gas milage, cost to own (registration, insurance) repair costs and maintenance.

I bought it new in '91 it's black on black, the first black SC Coupe sold in Florida 3/17/92! It's an automatic with AM/FM Cassette, period. It's never been aligned and each time delivers 50K miles of even treadwear on the Firestone GTA's. I'm going to buy my forth set this week as I'm turning my black beauty over to my son who started driving this year. Parts are cheap with the exception of the electric fuel pump which recently failed at 145K miles. It cost me $210 at PEP Boys. Saturn wanted $400 !!! The alternator which is this cars only weak point cost $66. The brakes can be replaced for under $50 all the way around and filters and such are dirt cheap. The auto tranny even has its own spin on filter. I've had to replace the acc. drive belt tensioner twice. Maybe related to alternator troubles. But I must say the car has never stranded me and if driven easily will reward with 30 mpg with a 124HP on tap if needed. Now that doesn't sound like much but the HP to weight ratio is very favorable on the light weight SC. There is also a performance button which holds shifts to redline if desired.

The SC also features automatic seat belts which insurance companies give a nice dicount for. It also has split foldown rear seats which increase an already large trunk further. It has the identical trunk release and gas cap release that I have on my Lexus. The exhuast is stainless steel and still looks good. The brakes are disc up front and drums in the rear although rear discs were an option. The engine is very stylish with its twin cam covers and spark plugs running down between them. The ignition uses only coils which have eliminated a distributor cap and its maintenance headaches. The AC still blows cold after 11 years, Saturn got that one right. The engine block is cast aluminum along with the head. They used the lost foam casting technique which was state of the art in 1991. The cloth interior has worn very well although I'm sure the black color and black carpets have hidden a stain or two. If you find one of these cars with decent milage consider it strongly. My son feels it fits in nicely among the Honda Civics and Mitsu Eclipses his peers drive. There are also many parts and accessories for the Saturns to dress 'em up for the street.
