            I bought a 1996 Neon.  I loved the car - it had spunk and zip and didn't cause too much trouble.  This particular car was a two door - not normally a problem, but the blind spots are horrible.  Be careful!!  The car was a standard and ran very well - never had any troubles.  Juts make sure you buy a four door instead of a two door to avoid the neck strain required to operate this vehicle safely.<br><br>
