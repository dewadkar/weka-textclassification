            I bought this vehicle about a month ago and I can't stop myself from driving it every chance I can.  I got this car to replace my 1996 VW Golf GL (nothing wrong with it, just got a promotion at work and decided to spoil myself) and this car has impressed me more than my old one.  

I love how easily this car accelerates and how easily it takes corners.  If anyone is looking into buying this car, I strongly recommend getting the Cold Weather Package so you can get the heated seats.  I don't know how I lived with out them :-)  Another nice option for any VW is the Monsoon Sound System.  It's well worth the extra money because it comes with a 200-watt amp in the back and it is the best sound I�ve ever heard from a stock radio system.  

Besides all the big things, its the little things that VW thinks of that makes you just say &quot;WOW� I love how the power sunroof can also be operated by a crank (hidden by a panel in the roof) just incase the power sunroof breaks.  Also, the auto UP and auto down power windows are a really nice touch!  I think anyone who is looking for a rather powerful and easily customizable sporty car; this is the one for you.  You will have to look around to find one you want (because of the way VW does its manufacturing) but its worth the small trouble to find the best car you'll ever own (besides another VW :-)  

Just a side note, if anyone is looking to buy from the Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD area, I would strongly suggest dealing with Greg from Russell Volkswagen (up off Rt. 40, just outside 695).  I got the best deal possible (even cheaper than Greenlight.com's price), and great service.  I highly recommend him and the dealership that he works for.
