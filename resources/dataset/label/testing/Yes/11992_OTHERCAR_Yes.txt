            I just bought a 1998 mirage and i love it. Five speed on the floor with a 4 cyl. engine. I can't believe how fast it is it still puts you in your seat in 5th gear at 60 mph. I have all leather interior witch is very comfortable.Handles very well in corners and steering wheel response is very firm.The car has 60,000 miles on it,has no leaks and use no oil.Have one small rattle in the back and road noise is alittle load but i think new tires will help that.Car is red with tan leather looks sharp.I have told friends to get this car.<br><br>
