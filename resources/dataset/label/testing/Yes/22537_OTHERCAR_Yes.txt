            I am an 18 year old college student who recently purchased a black '98 Monte Carlo Z34. I fell in love with it the first time I laid eyes on it. The Z34 has a much more sporty look to it than the regular Monte's, but it isn't so sporty that you need to wear a racing helmet while driving. Just look at some of the things this baby has to offer:  
-leather seats
-power sunroof
-power doors/windows
-cd player
-automatic headlights
-dual exhaust
-a very col heating/cooling system that lets the driver control how hot/cold they want it, while passenger can have something totally different.
-and did I mention the black leather seats. Oh yeah, I just love that perk. 
This beautiful piece of machinery comes jam packed with a 3.8L V-6 Engine, w/ 200 horsepower. She can get up to 50 before you can finish saying "Wanna Race?" 
One thing that really intrigued me about the '98 Monte Carlo Z34 is the great amount of space. It's got a ton of room in the trunk, and not only that, but for a two-door, there is a lot of leg room in the back. I am a big man of 6'3, and I fit comfortably behind an even bigger man of 6'4. I always love a lot of room in the backseat for those, intimate occasions, if ya know what I mean.
One thing that I don't really appreciate is the fact that there is only one cup holder. Most cars that I have been in have two. Another thing that isn't great is how heavy the doors are. They are fairly big doors, but they contain a lot of weight. So guys, if you're going on a date with a petite girl, open and close the doors for her. If I had to tell you that in the first place you're not doing a very good job.
After looking at the pros and cons of this vehicle, I noticed that I could only find two cons, while there are many pros to choose from. I think that anyone who bought this car would be extremely satisfied. It's sporty enough for the guys that want to look cool, and it has enough room for the people who need to sprawl out. I am absolutely in love with this car, so go out and buy a Monte Carlo Z34, you don't know what you're missing.
