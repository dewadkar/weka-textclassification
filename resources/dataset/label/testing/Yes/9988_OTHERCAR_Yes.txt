            What a nice truck!  The Sonoma stands up to all of its competition.  In many areas this truck excells over its competition.  I can't emphasize enough the durability of this pickup.  I've personally never had any serious problems with the vehicle, and I've only received good performance from the truck.  It's 0-60 is only 9 seconds, but when this is analyzed it is above average from its competitors.  Its main downfall in my opinion is the poor crash test results.  However I find the body style to be quite attractive.  It can be fitted to suit just about any requirement needed for this powerful V6 engine.<br><br>
