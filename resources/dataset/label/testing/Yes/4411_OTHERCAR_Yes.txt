            When my father bought a new car this past September, I was ecstatic to learn that his old one, the 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix SE would soon become mine. As a college student that lives about 2 to 2.5 hours from home, I knew it would come in very handy in the commute. And I haven't been let down yet. The car handles like a dream, really tight steering, a great alignment and excellent acceleration. I really prefer it for the highway driving because of the way it handles, and the gas mileage I get. I do a lot of highway driving at school (since its in the middle of nowhere) and I usually get at least about 275 miles per tank of gas and it has been known to get over 300 miles per tank many times, which is a lot of trips to the mall. The car has really had minimal problems, but it has been very well taken care of with regular oil and service checks. Currently it has about 114,000 miles on it and is still running in great condition, in fact the place where we service the car says it has at least another 20,000-30,000 miles on it (which I will never end up using). My greatest recommendation for this car is to maintain it regularly. The features inside are great: dual airbags; cruise control; sunroof; an am/fm stereo system that, in addition to having really good sound (for a factory system) has TONS of room for programmable stations. I can keep my usual 6 I use at home on FM 1, the 6 I use at school on FM 2 and then 6 more on AM. I think besides the general drive and handling of the car my two favorite features are the radio buttons on the steering wheel, really convenient, and the little information center up on the left side of the dash; which tells me the outside temperature, my current miles per gallon, the average miles per gallon, my average speed, how long my trip has been (in hours), the number of gallons Iï¿½ve used, and an approximation of how many miles I have left in my tank. Having been in the car a lot in the previous years while I was a passenger, I can say from experience that the car is very comfortable and roomy. The trunk is huge, I moved all of my possessions, including computer and TV, into school using just this car. I think the greatest compliment this car can really be given is from my father, who just purchased a 2001 Lexus ES300 and STILL raves about my car when he has the chance to drive it.<br><br>
