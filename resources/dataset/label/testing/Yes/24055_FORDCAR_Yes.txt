            The most intriguing thing about my 1997 4x4 &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; is the flexibility.  I've hauled up to eight full grown adults numerous times as well as put the seats down and hauled a full load of furniture or supplies for my new house.  It's been the perfect family vehicle for my four person family.

It handles favorably compared to other trucks in its class, but don't let anyone fool you into thinking it will drive like a Maxima.

I particularly like the nice, high driving position.  It's one of those trucks you hate to be behind in traffic, but it's great to be in one.  You have a much better view of what's happening around you and can react much more capably.

However, also because of the height, I find myself helping my small kids into the truck frequently.  They cannot reach the great handles designed to help hoist yourself into your seat.  Don't even think about getting a 4x4 without ordering the running boards.  And the lights on the running boards are very useful, not just a frivolous add-on.

The climate control system is very good if you get the overhead console.  All controls are clearly visible and easy to access.  And there's storage space galore.  My truck has eight cup holders and six map pockets.

Filling the 30 gallon gas tank is an unenjoyable experience.  It does give you plenty of time to go in and get a cup of coffee though.

Finally, I opted for the Expedition over the Suburban because it would fit in my garage.  But, barely.<br><br>
