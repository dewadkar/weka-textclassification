            I bought my 96 850 in 99 while still under factory warranty. Have now put over 30K miles on it and have yet to have any expenses with it besides maintenance. This is a very finely built car for the price. Not quite at Mercedes or AUDI level but close and it is much cheaper.

What do I like about it? 

This car is roomy for its size. The trunk is big and the interior space is great. Cant be beat. 

And then there are those amazing seats! Why dont the other car manufacturers just copy Volvo's seats? They are amazing. Drove 10 hours to the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Indianapolis and could hardly feel it. What a comfortable seat...

I also like the response from the standard engine, the engine is powerful enough. But if you want to impress the mustang drivers you can always get the Turbo engine. 

Finally a word about the transmission. Really smooth and trouble free. I like the winter/sport/economy modes and they really work well. Winter mode starts the car in 2nd gear to save you from spinning wheels on ice. And sport mode lets the engine rev a little more. Great!

What I dont like about it?

The ride is a little harsh. The suspension is hard and there is quite a bit of noise at higher speeds. It is not too bad but could be better. 

The interior is a little "Volvo boring" with outdated styling. The s70 addressed this issue but of course the real deals are on the used 850s so if you can live with a old style interior this is not too bad...

CONCLUSION: Great used car buy. The best really. Cant go wrong. Make sure you get a good condition car and you will have many miles of comfortable, safe and reliable driving in European sedan style for very little money.
