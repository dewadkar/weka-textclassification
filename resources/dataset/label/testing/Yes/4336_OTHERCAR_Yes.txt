            why?
looks great.
rides through anything.
can carry mountain bikes in back.
only one on block.

love and hate?
love - the looks
love - no top (open air ride)
love - raw 4X4 power
hate - interior (looks like the thing was on safari)
hate - steering at highway speeds (can get hairy - use 2 hands)

to drive?
totally raw 4X4 experience - this is no RANGE ROVER. it doesnt corner well. doesnt have great pickup. but it will go through anything. i mean anything. 

who?
people looking for a fun 4x4 in a top quality truck that is hard to find. people look for a perfect outdoor truck with lots of room. actually its much nicer looking and much higher quality then a jeep wrangler/sport/sahara.
