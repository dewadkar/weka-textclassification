            The tastes of the current sports car buyer makes no sense to me.  Sure, your Honda or Toyota is more fuel efficient, and it possibly uses an engine that is more dependent on electronics, but who in gods name can go up to their friends and boast about these things?  &quot;Hey d00d, I got the coolest car in the world:  its a small coupe that has a magnificent trunk big enough to hold my skis, and it doesn't spend much gas.&quot;  So lets face it, when it comes to sports cars, only two things matter more often than not -- performance and handling.  And when it comes to pure power, nothing even comes close to the bang-for-buck value offered by the Pontiac Firebird, or its brother Camarro.

The base model Firebird punches around 200HP with its V6, but I honiestly couldn't give a penny about that.  The V8 model (either a Formula or a more refined Trans Am - TA) is the true deal, punching 305HP, and a monster 320HP with the optional Ram Air Package that comes with 17inch rims and a fully functional hood scoop.  Now, what is 320HP to you?  Well, numerically speaking, its a number only matched by the Mustang Cobra built by Ford's Special Vehicles Team.  Other cars under 30k?  Only a few hit the 200HP benchmark, and their windows will shudder and shake as these behemoths fly by them.  Despite the offensive glares I might be getting now, truth is the truth.  There is absolutely NO import sports car under 30k that can punch above 250HP in its stock form as of today.

Its not all laughs and giggles, as the Firebird is a heavy car because of its monstrous engine and steel body.  Gunning the gas pedal simply means you will have to peel yourself off the seat later, as 0-60 acceleration is godly.  But, the weight of the car will make itself known at regular city speeds.  I know, because I use to haul a 95 model FF through the streets of Manhatten a couple of years ago.  The 6spd manual was no joy, and I rarely ever would get off the 2nd gear.  Firebird is not meant to be driven slow, and when you have no choice it will make you feel sorry.  You will feel every bump and rock on the road, and if you can't handle it, the stiff performance suspension will make you feel abused.

The body of firebird...well, I think the car has the sexiest design for a muscle car -- its seductively aggressive.  The black TA with the hood scoop looks downright sinister.  I love this design, but it does cause the sales to decline.  Why, simply that it hasn't changed a bit for years except for rewamped lights or other little things here and there.  It takes a fanatic to spot the difference between a 95 and a 99 TA.

Firebird also looses in terms of interior.  Not a single person buys a sports car for its back seats, but if you look at the back seats of a TA, you will realize that only dwarves or little kids can sit there.  But, as in all Pontiacs, the gauges will make it seem like you are in a cockpit at night.  From the front, the driver's seat offers comfortable access to the pedals and the shifter, but you do feel the closeness to the ground.  Useless to say, its not for the faint hearted.  Getting in and out of the car is another story all together.

Overall, the Firebird is still the best bang-for-buck sports car.  If you want to be the king of the road, don't deviate from the path of buying one.  But this is neither a commuter nor a joy rider.  Its a car for the true speed enthusiast, and you might end up owning a piece of history if GM does end up discontinuing the F-body sports cars at 2001.
