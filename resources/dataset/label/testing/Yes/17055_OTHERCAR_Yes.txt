            Once again Dodge has come up with a winning combination: the power of the Ram pick-ups and the comfort of the Grand Cherokee. The Durango has comfortable seating for 5 (with options for 7) and a large cargo area with two extra storage bins within the bed. Like it's sister the Dakota, the dash is well laid out and easily accessible from driver and passenger seats. The 7 speaker stereo system is great, full sound from the front or back. The ride is a little rough, but you would expect that given the capacity to tow a house cross country. The CD/cassette holder is a bit awkward to use while driving, and there are more cup holders than a family can possibly use, but these are small problems. It has a bigger feel inside than either the Explorer or the Jimmy, but it doesn't feel as cavernous and bulky as the Navigator. A real bargain for the price, and there are lots of great options that really dress it up. This SUV will be seen often on the road and off. Dodge does it again!<br><br>
