            &quot;Delicate&quot; Luxury in an all terrain vehicle, The Land Rover Discovery II.

I'll get to the definition of &quot;delicate luxury&quot; later. Lets first point out that Land Rover's selling techniques are definitely not delicate. Be prepared to pay the sticker price because they do not come off of it. If you can get past the attitude of take it for this price or go away because someone else will, you will be hooked when the dealer lets you take the vehicle home for a couple of days. The two day affair was what won me over against the Jeep Cherokee.

The Discovery has some great attributes including the smooth ride ( like a Mercedes Sedan) , the dual climate control, dual sunroofs, heated leather seats, superb sound system, very attractive look and all the other amenities. The frame has been redesigned and there is safe, comforting feeling while driving the vehicle.

Things to be concerned about are included in what I term the vehicles's &quot;Delicate&quot; luxury. Little things seem to go wrong like buttons popping off, knobs coming loose and the glove compartment not closing properly. I've purchased two Land Rovers and both had these problems.

Lets not forget the gas issues. Terrible gas mileage. Nothing else to say.

If your looking to spend $40,000 on a great looking, luxury SUV, which could run through the toughest terrain, even though you'll never take it out of the city the Land Rover Discovery II is for you. Be prepared to have a few headaches, but the feeling you get behind the wheel is worth it.
