            <b>Imagine the greatest all-wheel drive system in the world coupled to a capable, highly tunable turbo 5-cylinder in a sporty, classic looking 2-door hatchback.</b>  That's what you get with the highly sought after Ur-Quattro imported into the US between 1983 and 1985.  I happened to come across a well-seasoned 83 model with about 140K miles and in need of a lot of TLC.  Nevertheless, the opportunity to drive one of these cars and talk to a dedicated, fanatical Audi owner who really knows his stuff doesn't come along everyday.

<b>History</b>
The Ur-Quattro (meaning original Quattro in German) is essentially the street-legal derivative of the winning Audi Turbo Coupe Rally car.  <b>Only 240 models were imported to the US in 1983</b>, followed by 65 in 1984, and 73 in 1985.  The package included the venerable 10V 5-cylinder intercooled turbo and 15x8 Ronal light alloys driving the all-time all-wheel drive Quattro system.  

<b>Tuning</b>
Stock horsepower was 160, but easily tunable up to 300 with a chip, replacement of the wastegate spring, and larger turbo and intercoolers.  <b>This makes for near exotic car performance, but when coupled with the stock 5-speed tranny (with a final gear ratio of 3.89) still allows you to get 28 MPG on the highway!</b>  There are a lot of Audi tuners out there who would love to work on a car like this.  Plus the web is chock full of aftermarket performance parts shops as well as tons of great information to help you do it yourself.

<b>Hits</b>
Well, my other Audi reviews are replete with praise of the Audi Quattro system, so I'll focus on other aspects (except to say that unless you encounter 10 inches of snow, this car can get you there).  <b>Mainly, the cost:</b>  even given the rarity of the Ur-Quattro you can still pick one up for as little as $4000; most tend to be in the $7000-$10000 range in great condition.   <b>Because Audi used basically the same block and interchanged parts liberally between all models, spare motors and trannys are around in abundance.</b>  You could even get a 20V head to replace the 10V version on the stock Ur-Quattro to boost horsepower to at least 200 without any other mods.

<b>Misses</b>
<b>TURBO LAG!</b>  Since the technology around back in the early 80's was quite a bit different than today, the biggest noticeable performance problem with these cars is turbo lag.  You really need to keep the revs up to continuously make and keep power, which is one reason these make great track and rally cars (the revs are usually up then).  

<b>THE BOMB</b>  Not  with the connotations you think - this is actually a term for the brake pressure accumulator - a problem with many Audis.  The problem is that when these start to go bad, the pedal goes stiff during a panic stop situation (which doesn't exactly instill a great deal of confidence).  Right after you slam on the brakes and get the hard pedal, the pedal then slides to the floor as pressure reaccumulates.  These can be expensive to fix ($250 + labor), but necessary for any competition events.

<b>Dated styling</b>
On a somewhat minor note, the cars while classic to some appear dated to others.  <b>Certainly, the interior is wanting of ergonomic improvements; but again, this car is nearly 20 years old.</b>  What some clever owners have done is replace the dash on these early cars with one from 87 Audi GT Coupes.  Apparently, many of the electrical switches and paths are identical, making for a relatively easy swap.  

<b>Overall - if you can find one in good shape, get it.</b>
This is a great car for all seasons whether you need an autocrosser (it a G-Stock car in SCCA - which can mean an easy win), daily driver (28 MPG + great in bad weather with the locking differentials), track car (aftermarket wheels are plentiful), or a combination of all of these.  The advantage of the legendary Quattro system is particularly apparent in this sporty and extremely rare example of Audi's famous German engineering.<br><br>
