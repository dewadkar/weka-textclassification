            My mouth about hit the ground when my husband came home with this monstrosity.  I imagined him tearing through a muddy field, in his cowboy hat, shotgun rack...better not go there.

We've had it for about a year now, and my husband says it's his favorite vehicle he's ever owned.  He drives a half hour to work on Indiana back roads through Amish country.  They aren't big on plowing out there.  He drove his Blazer through 3 feet of snow, picked up 3 Amish riders and was still on time for work.  He takes much pride that it will go anywhere.

Although it is equipped with Overdrive, the mileage is terrible.  13-16 miles per gallon is all you can expect to get out of this tank. 

The top is removable, my boys think this is great.  You have to unscrew 15 screws to get the top off, however, so I wouldn't recommend taking off if there is the remotest possibility of rain, you won't get it back on in a hurry.

One of my husband's favorite features about his blazer is the back seat goes down making room for all kinds of assorted junk.  With it's 350 fuel injected engine, even more junk can be towed behind it.  My husband has hauled a hay wagon FULL of firewood for Amish friends on more than one occasion.

Being a Chevy, parts are cheap and easy to come by.  My husband required this in a vehicle after owning a Dodge vehicle.  He says the parts are easy to get to, and he doesn't even have to jack it up to change the oil.

I have driven this vehicle only twice.  I must admit is was kind of fun, although I wouldn't want to try to get out of a tight space with it.  I also wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to attract attention.  I felt extremely conspicuous driving to get groceries in this thing.

This blazer isn't for everybody.  I personally prefer my little "Mommymobile".  But for boys that like big toys, This is the machine!
