            Motivation:
Are you a jeep person?  If you don't know, then you probably aren't.  Let's face it, Jeeps aren't for everyone.  I can't tell you how many people I have talked to just after buying a jeep, and all they do is complain about the noisy soft top, how rough the ride is, or the lack of amenities.  Come on now, you bought a jeep!

History: 
The Jeep has been around since 1941, when Willy's made the first all-purpose military vehicle.  The design was so successful, that a correspondent named Ernie Pyle wrote &quot;I don't think we could continue...without the Jeep.  It does everything.  It goes everywhere.  It's as faithful as a dog, as strong as a mule, and as agile as a goat.  It constantly carries twice what it was designed for and still keeps going.&quot;  A few years later, a civilian version, the CJ, was introduced.  Over the next 50 years, Jeep left the overall design the same, and just improved the handling, powerplant, and suspension systems.  Most people are used to the really rough ride, the dial-less dash, and the rough finish of the old-fashioned jeep.  However, in 1997, Jeep made major design changes that will forever change the way we look at Jeeps.

Makeover:  
In 1997, the biggest change is the Quadra-Coil suspension.  This allows up to seven more inches of wheel travel. For those of you that know what it takes to go off-roading, you know how important this is.  It allows all four wheels to maintain better contact with the ground.  Also, the overall ride is significantly improved.  The first time I drove a new Wrangler, I couldn't believe how good it felt to drive.  This isn't your Daddy's jeep!  It has the suspension characteristics of the Grand Cherokee, and on the high way, it feels great.  Other significant changes include standard dual-airbags, and optional four-wheel ABS.

Other Info:
Truthfully, the jeep feels great on the road.  With the 220hp optional straight six, power is not an option.  Just starting the engine gives off a throaty growl, and you know that you are driving a monster.  The soft top (which I own) has been substantially improved.  However, it will be rather load at highway speeds, so don't expect the quiet ride of a car.  But it is good to know that the top will not leak at all, even in the heaviest Florida rains.  The seats are made to get wet, and the carpet is easily removable.  I have the aluminum allow wheels, and they really set off the right look.  
The back seat is actually practical.  The passengers sit up more, so it gives the feeling of much more room that a two-door car would.  There is plenty of head room (I am 6'3&quot;), so you don't feel cramped.
I can't tell you how pleased I have been with my new jeep!


Options:
If you are planning on doing a lot of highway driving, I would recommend the hard top.  I am glad that I have the soft top, though, because I like being able to easily take it down any time I want.  Also, be sure that you go with the Sport or Sahara (with the six cylinder).  The four cylinder just doesn't have the power you need. Plus, it makes it much easier to get the options such as the Speaker Bar, which is a must if you want to be able to hear your music at high speeds!

Overall:
I definitely recommend the Wrangler if you are interested in getting off-road, and you can't imagine yourself driving a sedan or a simple road car.  However, if you like your luxury, you may want to upgrade to the Grand Cherokee.
