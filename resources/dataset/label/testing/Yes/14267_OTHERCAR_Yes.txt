            The RX-7 is a spectacular car to own if you're handy with working on your own vehicle, and have alot of patience for dealing with Japanese cars with unique engines.  Take good care of it and chances are the car will reward you with some thrilling rides.

I bought a 1979 model back in 1994 for $1500.  It was my first car.  I was in high school, and at 16 that car looked alot cooler than the vehicles my friends were all buying.  I shelled out my hard earned dollars in exchange for a car that was in excellent physical shape, and it even had an interesting history with it.  The owner had stories from all of the car's previous owners, including the first owner who had custom ordered it before the first 7's off the line had even hit showfloors.  The car had some great stories behind it, and I was uniquely positioned to be the only person in my high school who had a car with a manual choke.

<b>Engine</b>

The engine was (and still is today) a Wankel Rotary.  It was the 12A model, which was getting about 20 miles per gallon by the time I got ahold of it (down from the &quot;showroom new&quot; 22mpg per Road &amp; Track).  Rotary engines don't have pistons.  They have two rotors (triangular pieces with rounded corners) that are located on a central driveshaft.  The rotors spin around an oval-shaped cavity within the engine, fired by two spark plugs for each rotor.  On each of the three corners of the rotor are &quot;apex seals&quot; which are what allow the rotor to build compression and drive the vehicle, so if the apex seals go, no more engine compression.  The rotary engine is more efficient than a piston driven engine because there is no conversion of torque from vertical to horizontal.  When you think about a V-6 engine for example, the pistons are more or less moving up and down, and then that power is transfered to the crankshaft which (theoretically) runs from side to side.  In the rotary, the rotors are connected directly to the crankshaft, transferring the torque directly to the drivetrain.  My particular car had 105,000 miles on it when I bought it, and I added about 20,000 over the six months I had it, with nothing more than oil changes and standard engine maintenance.

<b>Drivetrain</b>

The RX-7 is a standard rear drive vehicle.  There was a condition that caused the clutch to wear more quickly than other cars, but that wasn't something I ever had to deal with either.  The transmission however, did fail, and I'm sure it was because I beat on the car pretty bad.  I replaced it myself though.  A &quot;junkyard&quot; about three hours away had a refurbished transmission in stock, and it took me about four hours and $75 (including the replacement tranny) to put it on jackstands in the garage and replace it.

<b>Interior</b>

The interior was very cozy.  One of my friends' parents said it best that, &quot;You don't drive this car, you wear it.&quot;  The car was terribly comfortable for long rides though.  It rode very low to the ground, and was a two seater, so you sit about six inches off the floor and your legs run more or less straight out in front of you.  The instrument layout was very friendly and clearly laid out for quick reference at high speeds.  

<b>Performance</b>

The old Road &amp; Track statistics for the 1st generation RX-7 would demonstrate it to be a real pooch.  They had the car pegged at around 9 seconds for the 0-60, and I believe that to be about right.  This car performed at its best when at high speeds as the engine is tuned for high-revving performance.  I never tried drag racing this car because I knew it wasn't too quick off the line, but in one of many stupid moves, I followed a buddy in a mid-80's Oldsmobile with a 350 engine in it.  My speedometer was showing around 135 before we laid off, so if asked the fastest I'd had the car running, I'd probably say 120 to figure for speedometer accuracy.  The car ran pretty quietly at normal highway speeds though, and the ride was not sacrificed for the excellent manueverability it had either.  

I should also add that I was living in northern Minnesota at the time I had this car, and like any non-traction controlled rear wheel driver, it didn't handle that well in the snow, but at the same time, the driver sat close enough to the rear-wheels that your weight was almost over the axle, so it wasn't too unwieldy if driven carefully in the winter.


<b>Summary</b>

If you're still with me at this point, you may wonder why I got rid of the car.  It wasn't actually by choice.  I got hit on my way to class on the first day of my senior year.  The woman who hit me was screwing around with her baby in the backseat instead of watching where she was going, and she came out of a sidestreet at me.  I t-boned her going up a hill, but because it was an unmarked intersection, the police ruled nobody was at fault.  I can tell you that there would be worse cars to be in a similar accident with.  The seemingly all-steel RX-7 took some crinkling to the right-front quarter panel and knocked the front bumper out of alignment.  The woman's 1985 Datsun (Nissan) wagon was absolutely demolished and was towed away from the scene.  (By the way, neither she nor the baby were hurt.)

I was able to continue driving the RX-7 for a few more months until the exhaust system started acting up.  The thermal reactor (Mazda rotary- speak for exhaust header) got a crack in it when the rear catalytic converter got plugged.  This caused the thermal reactor to light up red hot when the car was moving, and I didn't figure that would be too good seeing as the gas lines werern't too terribly far away.  That WAS an expensive part to replace (about $800 I think), so I ended up junking the car and doing without a vehicle for a few months until I bought my next Mazda, a 1993 MX-6.  This car convinced me to be a Mazda owner for a couple more years, but when they eliminated all of the cool-looking cars (no disrespect to Miata fans - not enough car for the price in my opinion), namely the RX-7 and MX-6, I chose to look elsewhere.  I'd still love to import a right-drive RX-7 from Japan someday (they still manufacture them new, and in fact recently redesigned them) but it's not in my future anytime soon.<br><br>
