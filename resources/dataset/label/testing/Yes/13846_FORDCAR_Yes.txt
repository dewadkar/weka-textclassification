            This ain't a rent-a-car.  The $23,000 195hp Contour SVT screams on the road and leaves a whole lotta cars behind from the get go.  Fun fun fun to drive.  It handles like a dream.  It's for a special class of drives only, for it only comes with a smooth-shifting, leather-clad 5 speed manual.  You can expect to have BMW fun without coughing up BMW kind of $.  Ok, it's not exactly M3; call it Ford-built M2.5.  

So far Ford has a few re-calls on it, nothing major, just a hassle bring it back to the dealer though.  The fit and finish of the car is, well, Ford quality, (what do you expect?) but if you think about how much FUN you can have taking it fast around the corner and leaving others (at least 50% of them) behind when the light turns green, you can overlook these little details.  Those sports tires are useless in the snow, but this is a known fact.  Just take it out any other day and driving becomes more than a basic necessity.

Value: high!  Fun factor: high!  Performance: high! Road noise: pretty loud. (did I say it screamed?)  Reliability: so far so good.  Cargo space: good for its size.  Front seats: very comfortable.  Back seats: terrible (who says you are obligated to include others in the fun.)

Sorry, premium gasoline only for this baby.
