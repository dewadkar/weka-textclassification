            I bought my 94 Extra Cab 4x4 truck because I know that Toyota trucks last.
I had an 89 4x4 reg cab with 140K.  I traded it because I wanted more room and V-6!  I love the reliability of my truck.  The 3.0 V-6 with the 5-speed manual transmission is a great combination.  I have driven a 94 with the 3.0 and an automatic transmission and I personally would not recommend it.  Manual transmissions will definately last longer!  It had the head gaskets replaced by the dealer because of defects in the factory ones.  I haven't had a single problem with it at all.  I love the nice TIGHT steering.  It is by far the best handling 4x4 truck I've ever driven.(I been behind the wheel of all Domestics and even a Nissan)
It won't roll on turns or make you sea-sick.  The one drawback is the stiff suspension.  That is something that you just have to get used to.  The bottom line is that if you want to buy a truck that will go anywhere and last virtually forever BUY A TOYOTA!!<br><br>
