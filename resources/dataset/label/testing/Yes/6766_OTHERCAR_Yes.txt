            I purchased my W-350 one ton 4X4 Cummins dually with the manual 5 speed transmission new in 1992. I own a contracting business so I opted to go with the cab and chassis with a full service body on the rear. This has been one of the most mechanically reliable vehicles I have ever owned. 

The vehicle now has approximately 80,000 miles on it. I've replaced the front and rear brakes on the vehicle once and had a minor seal leak where the rear driveshaft enters the transfer case. I've also replaced the battery twice. The biggest problem I've had with the vehicle is cosmetic. The factory white paint is literally peeling off. I hear there is a possibility that Dodge may pay to have it repainted. I will be contacting them soon to find out. I don't think it is a problem limited to Dodge alone as I have seen a number of Chevy trucks doing the same thing. Also the dash squeaks badly especially on a unpaved road. 

As far as towing goes, this thing is awesome. I have more than once pulled a fully loaded semi off the road that had broken down. A fully loaded semi weighs in the neighborhood of 80,000 pounds! When I hook my 23 foot boat behind it I almost can't tell it's back there. The fuel economy averages 14-15 mpg, not too shabby considering the power the vehicle has. The new Cummins with it's improved fuel injection system is much stronger.<br><br>
