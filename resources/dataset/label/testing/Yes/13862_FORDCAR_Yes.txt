            I have a 1998 FORD Contour SE.  At first I wasn't to sure about buying it.  I was looking for a sporty but cheap car.  I thought that it was probably to much money for what you got. It was a blizzard the day I test drove it and it handled better than any other car I have owned.  It is quick to the punch, sleek, and roomy enough for five.  I have bought 3 new cars in my life and this one was the best. Not only was it a four door, but I could also show them young teens on the strip that it wasn't a granny car.  When you want to pass a car you don't have to sit and think to yourself, go nelly you can do it, because by the time you say go you already passed the slow cars in front of you. It came with all the options I was looking for... air, cruise, tilt, power windows, mirrors, and door locks.  Not to mention the floor mats as well! I have loved my car since the day I got it.  However, the only thing I haven't liked about it is the 4 or 5 recalls. Not that they were major time consuming, but I don't have alot of time to sit around and wait for them to fix it. Other than that, I love it!!  <br><br>
