            While no stranger to photography, both film and digital, this was my first personal digital camera purchase. I have used a few different models from Olympus, Panasonic and Sony either through work or by borrowing from friends. So when I set out to buy a digicam for myself, I had some experience as well as my own list of qualifications which I call the 4 Ps: performance, pixels, portability and price. After reviewing several models and reading user opinions on both this site and c|net's computers.com, I came to the conclusion that the Canon Powershot S10 was the right model for me. It's small size means I will take it with me when I would leave others behind (I HATE carrying stuff with me), it captures a respectable 2.1 megapixels (the S20 has more but at a considerable price hike), it has great manual features, and I found a great price for it ($464 at thedigitaldog.com, not the best or fastest service, but local retailers wanted $599 for it!).
After receiving the unit and taking it on a weekend getaway to Catalina Island, the camera has lived up to every expectation. I got beautiful shots and could keep it in my shorts pocket without much fuss. I used the camera's stitch assist mode and included software to create a QTVR panoramic scene with remarkable ease. Photos were crisp, even at the lower resolution settings, and color was overall quite good. The USB cable works great, with the software automatically launching if desired when it senses the camera is attached, and a TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop and similar applications.
Now the shortcomings. The problems I have with this camera are not the fault of the camera itself, but rather lie at the feet of Canon. The supplied battery is a joke and didn't last the first day out of the box. Luckily I knew this from user's comments and bought the re-chargeable battery pack at the time of purchase. Canon should make this part of the package from the get-go. The 8MB CompactFlash card is on the skimpy side also, but that is more or less acceptable. Canon really should have also included a carrying case, even just a cloth one. I am always concerned about scratching the LCD viewfinder on this camera. One last very small detail as I doubt people would use this much, but Canon's stitching software does not create QTVR objects.
The product is great, Canon just needs to step up to the plate and really make a better package to go with it.<br><br>
