            When I first bought the Nikon 775, I was amazed by it's small, light feeling. This was the main reason I bought this camera, and now I was impressed. 

I also liked how Nikon managed to include a Lithuim Ion battery with a charger to the $400 price tag (you can get it online for $250 manufactur refurbished...that is what I got, and it works great!). It is a very great thing that Nikon added it, for most digital cameras are basiclly not usable on standard batterys (they last a short amount of time).

The camera also has many many features. There are about 8 unique picture taking modes, one movie mode and a preview mode. This allows users to take the picture under any light contition, etc.

However, every camera has it's flaws. This camera does feel a little cheap, since it is plastic, unlike most cameras, which are metal...however this does feel pretty good.

The quality on the camera is pretty good, but I have seen better on other 2 MP digital cameras. The 8MB CompactFlash card included is less than satisfactory. Nikon should have at least inlcuded a 16MB for $400 camera!

Nikon also added a nice Transfer button to the camera, for quick connectivity (one button) to a computer for publishing onto the web or onto a hard drive. This is a great feature, especially for people without Windows XP.

I am pretty satisfied with this camera. Just remember, when buying, add about $50 to the price for a new memory card, 8 pictures on fine quality just isn't enough!
