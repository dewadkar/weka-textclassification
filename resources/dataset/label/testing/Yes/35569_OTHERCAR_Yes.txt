             When I decided I wanted a new car, I hit all the web sites and car adds. At first I wanted a Honda Accord Coupe or even the sporty Infiniti G20, but after test drives and taking a closer look at the new Civic I was set on the Civic. As much as liked the way the Ford Focus drove I realized that the Civic has a the best resale value and is the best car for your dollar. I test drove the Accord and it was lacking that fun ride that the Civic EX had.

 I came into the dealership wanting an Accord but after a quick test drive I changed my mind. My preconception of the Civic was that it was too small, with no power, and no cool features, but boy was I wrong.

 Looking at the new Civic I realized changes had been made, it resembled a BMW, very sporty and stylish. The salesman explained to me how they took 2 inchs from the front and added it to the back. The outside looked great but could the inside be so nice??? 

 As I hopped into the new stylish 2 door Civic Coupe EX and to my suprise I fit pretty well being 6'3". The seats were extremely comfortable and my legs had plenty of room. The interior and dash have been completly redesigned, Honda definetly went with the European look resembling a Jetta. All the gauges (Spedometer,Tachometer,etc) have a cool grey backing just adding to the cool look of the dash. One of the more exciting features of the new Civic is the way it lights up orange inside. The back seets of the new Civic have been totally redesigned adding over an inch of space which is quite a bit. They have also added a shoulder seat belt to the middle seat. The trunk too is very spacious, and the rare seats fold down.

 Driving the new Civic sealed the deal. It was smooth and extremely fast, and the brakes could stop at a dime. One suggestion I would make would be to get the Civic EX. The Civic EX gives you 12 extra HP, ABS brakes, a sun/moon roof, power everything, and still has the same great gas mileage, 31 MPG on roads and 38 MPG on the highway.

 I can't say enough about my new sporty, economicle new Civic coupe.
