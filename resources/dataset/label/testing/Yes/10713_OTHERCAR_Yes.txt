            When we were expecting our first child, we started shopping around for a digital camera. Because we also wanted the ability to print high-resolution 8 x 10 photos, we started by looking at 4 megapixel cameras.

When we saw the Camedia D40 Zoom at Best Buy as on open box special for $500, we decided to buy it. The small size was a plus because it would be light and easy to pack when lugging around all the baby stuff.

I was concerned that the camera did not have the ability to add accessory lenses or flashes and was limited to 2.8 optical zoom because I wanted to have the ability to photograph our child playing sports. But as my pragmatic spouse pointed out, by the time were ready for those features, we would probably be ready for a new camera anyway.

The camera is perfect for baby, family, holiday, and scenic photos. The remote control allows me to snap the picture while being in it.

We also like the ability to connect the camera to a TV&#146s audio\video ports and preview the pictures on screen. You can move the zoom button to see multiple images on screen, scroll to the picture you want, and then select it. Once you have selected the picture, you can zoom or pan within it.

The camera has more features than I&#146ll ever use. But I like and use the Night Scene, Portrait, Self Portrait and Scenic modes. When you select one of these modes, the camera automatically adjusts itself to the optimal settings for that mode. If you are photography buff, you&#146ll appreciate the ability to adjust all the settings manually. 

Uploading pictures to a Windows XP PC is a snap. When you plug in the camera to the USB port and slide back the over, the SmartMedia card appears as another drive. Including a USB cable with the camera is a nice touch by Olympus.

The battery life is average at best. If you are patient, you may be able to get the 100 shots that I hear some people get. But I find that after about 30 photos, it starts taking about 5 seconds for the flash to refresh. I get too impatient at this point and replace the batteries. The short battery life is due in part to Olympus using 2 AA batteries instead of 4. 

If you purchase this camera, I strongly recommend that you purchase a good battery charger and at least 4 rechargeable batteries. Also, you have to recharge the batteries as close as you can to when you will actually use them, or they drain while sitting on the shelf.

To focus, you press the shutter button halfway down while lining up the subject in the viewfinder crosshairs. You then press the shutter button down all the way to actually take the picture. It can take some time to get the hang of this. But it&#146s great entertainment to watch someone count &#147one...two...&#148 then accidentally snapping the picture before getting to three.

While you&#146re at it, you&#146ll want to pick-up a larger SmartMedia card. If you plan on going on a long trip, you may want to pick up a couple. But one 128-MB card is all I need for a week long vacation. If space starts getting a little tight, I can peruse the pictures and delete the ones I don&#146t like.

SmartMedia cards will probably no longer be used in digital cameras. But I suspect that they will still be available for some time.

The Camedia D40 Zoom comes with a Continuous\Burst mode setting designed to take several shots in a row. But the flash does not work with this setting, so you can only use it with good lighting. But with a 2.8 optical zoom, you probably won&#146t be taking pictures of fast moving sporting events at night anyway.

I couldn&#146t figure out how to get the date and time on the picture, so I wrote Olympus technical support. They responded about 3 days later saying I would have impose the date using photo editing software. The camera comes with Adobe Elements, but I prefer PhotoShop.

Speaking of PhotoShop, the resolution of pictures taken with the Camedia D40 Zoom is so good, I can zoom in on someone and crop out the rest of the picture so it looks like I took a close-up of them. This makes up for the lack of a more powerful zoom much of the time.

Unfortunately, Olympus no longer manufactures this Camera. The optimist may look at this as a chance to pick up a great camera cheap. The pessimist may be concerned that they do not have the latest state-of-the art technology.
