            i bought a ford escort; first, because it had enough room for my groceries, any purchases i made and all the cat litter i buy every couple of weeks.  Yet it is small enough to take to work every day.  even when i drove 250+ miles a week, the gas mileage was fantastic and i could fill up my gas tank for between $10 &amp; $12(when gas is high)a week.  The other benefit i insisted on was that my escort be large enough to hold my 70 pound black lab.  my dog loves to travel, and in my escort, she has the entire back seat to stretch out, and be comfortable in, all at the same time. 

By the way, i sent an e mail to one of the local ford dealers, and when i drove in to purchase my new escort, he was waiting for me.  he walked right up to me in my old car and said, &quot;hello pegsmouse1&quot;.  

This is the second ford escort wagon we have owned.  the first one traveled over 100,000 miles, survived a teenage driver (her first car) and when we traded it, we still got $3,000 toward my husbands new, fully loaded, ford taurus.
