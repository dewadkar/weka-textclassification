            I reviewed cameras for weeks before I settled on the Sony. I had gone over all the reviews for different cameras and finally settled on the Sony. Price was a major factor for me, and I found the DSC-P31 to have the features I desired and still be reasonably priced.
Taking pictures outside on a typical day yields some awesome picture quality. I have even taken sunset pictures and then framed the printout for personal Christmas presents to friends and family and they loved them. Most of them didn't believe it was a digital picture printed from my printer when they were told.
And being able to use the full capacity of the memory stick for video length is great. I usually just film until it is full then clip the good parts out on my computer. That way I don't feel like I missed anything because my 30 second timer quit just before my kid does something cute. I would prefer that it record sound along with it, but that would limit the time to record and I am sure would raise the price significantly.
Picture taking in low light conditions could be a little better, they have mastered it in video cameras, I don't understand the problem with digital still cameras not being able to adjust to low light levels. Of course I am also not an expert by any stretch of the imagination and for all I know it is just a setting I have to adjust!
And it is easy to use, my daughter (12 years old) grabs it at family gatherings and starts shooting away. She usually gets some of the best pictures because noone thinks much of it and she gets the true candid shots. And the camera is very forgiving about moving objects. My last digital camera was a super cheapy and if ANYTHING moved the whole picture was blurred. I have yet to find that in the pictures from this camera.
