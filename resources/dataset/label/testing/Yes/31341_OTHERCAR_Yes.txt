            When Audi brought the A4 to these shores, it was a turning point for the company.  I can remember show rooms were empty, and it was a long time before I saw another car like mine.  I started out looking for a SUV, then saw the prices and began thinking, I could drive something really nice.  Out of the Volvo 850, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C class, Infiniti I30 and the Mazda Millenia, the A4 was my choice.  It seemed the best value at the time, with a level of luxury reserved for cars costing 6 to 10 thousand dollars more.  We chose the A4 because it had a unique character not found in the Japanese cars in this class, and it cost thousands less than the comparable BMW and Mercedes while offering as good or better car.  Five years later, the company's fortunes seem to have turned around.  It's hard to get attention on Saturdays at the dealership and the showroom is completely remodeled.  Audi and style seem to go hand in hand, with alluring models all through its lineup.  

Performance

Yes, the A4 is sluggish off the line.  The 172 hp V6 requires revs above 3000 before you begin to feel any power.  There is no low end torque to speak of, and my Nissan 240SX felt stronger at the low revs.  Thankfully, the 5 speed manual is a slick shifter, and after 5 years and 80,000 miles, we've not missed a shift. The engine does rev happily to redline.  On the freeway, the car is in its element, cruising at speeds above 110 at times with no objections. The brakes worked extremely well at first, but after the first pad and disk replacement, they have lost the excellent feel they had and the stops seem longer.  The suspension keeps the wheels planted at all times, and the quattro keeps them rolling through anything.  The switch to Pirelli P6000 at 50k made the car a better handler. The steering provides excellent feedback and keep the car centered.  

Reliability

Electrical reliability is definitely a weakness here, something that seems to be common throughout this company after reading other reviews for VW and Audi.  The AC was a problem from the beginning.  We took the car in several times, and on the third visit, they discovered that a duct was improperly installed.  This after two sweaty summers in Texas heat.  Our AC stopped working after 60,000 miles, and the odometer is blacked out after 80k.  The climate control display has been blinking recently.  The remote entry only works on one of our remotes.  Mechanically, the car has been brilliant.  For some reason, the cooling fan on all Audis seem to make a lot of noise - you can hear one coming from blocks away at low speeds by the fan, not the engine noise or exhaust.  And the windshield washer reservoir hose keeps coming off.  I suspect that this is due to the tight quarters in the engine bay and the incompetence of mechanics, but I have no proof of these allegations.  

I have recently began looking for another car because my wife wants something that is more trouble free.  I tell her that most of these things are just nuisances, and that they happen to cars that get driven 22k miles in a year.  After test driving the more recent offerings from Acura, Infiniti, and BMW, I still get back in this car and marvel at how good it really is.  It feels bigger inside than it looks on the outside, and the trunk is generous for a car of this size.  All the cars mentioned have better power, but only the BMW surpasses it in terms of handling.  

Nice ride

Even after 5 years, this car is a terrific ride.  There is an annoying rattle that seems to be coming from the right front wheel well.  Just another minor nuisance. 

The controls on the car took some getting used to, but after you know where they are, they are very easy to use and you don't have to take your eyes off the road or hands off the steering wheel to use most of them.  The windows pop up and down with one touch, as does the moonroof.  The cabin is quiet, even at a 110mph.  

So after all those problems and the fact that the car is now 30 horsepower or more down on the competition, I still would like to go for another Audi. Unfortunately, my wife doesn't share my opinion, maybe because she is the one that drives it to the shop every time something goes wrong.  Yet somehow, it seems to have an identifying character that is so lacking in the Japanese cars of this class.  The interior and exterior are better designed.  I've never driven a front wheel only version of this car, but I feel the quattro gives it another unique characteristic that differentiate this car from the others. Yes, it has its share of problems, but I can justify overlooking those for all the qualities that are good about this car.  <br><br>
