            I leased the 1999 Buick Regal because after test driving it I felt comfortable with the car, and the price was within my budget. I have had the car over 4 months and the only problem I had was a noisy back seat which was corrected by the dealership by adding a clip. The car handles so easy and I always feel in control. It is easy to get in and out of. I like the pass through from the trunk to the back of the car to accommodate long items. The trunk is large and not too deep, which makes it easier retrieving items. That was one reason I ruled out the Mercury Sable. The only thing I don't like is the wind noise, which seems to be common among cars in that range. It is also very easy to exceed the speed limit, because it accelerates so effortlessly. I like to drive and usually offer to take my car. My friends tell me the car is very comfortable to travel in. It would be a good family car, with safety considerations for children. I am very pleased with my selection.
    Update 3/9/01 - I now have owned the car for over 19 months and have had no problems with it. I still enjoy driving it. It has been great on all types of road conditions. I am still very happy with my choice.
