            I started seeing the commercials on TV...and I liked what I saw. Then, I did some checking on the web, and I still liked what I saw. I looked at the 99's, but they didn't make my motor run...so finally the 2000 came out and I took it for a ride. Now I REALLY liked this car.
Next, I drove the competition...Prelude, Integra, a couple others. I liked them too, but not as much. Especially the prices, which were more than the Eclipse, and especially since the Eclipse comes with just about all the options I wanted standard(A/C, Sunroof, CD, Spoiler, Power Windows/Locks/Mirrors). I may be weird, but I hate ABS...so I didn't care if it only comes on the GT. 
So I debated for a few weeks, trying a few different dealers to see if I could get a REALLY good deal on one. Then, Mitsu came out with the Zero Down, Zero Interest, Zero Payments till '01...
So, I got the 5-Speed, because anyone who buys a sports car with an Automatic,(this isn't a TRUE sports car since it's Front Wheel Drive, but it's a lot better in the snow!), must not really like to drive. Sure, you can get the Video-Game-Style faux shifter that's &quot;almost the same&quot;, but I say &quot;Go drive in the arcade if that's for you.&quot; If you can't use a clutch, go away.
Anyway...Redline is 6000, and you can hit 100 at about 3800...a lot of top end room, and plenty of spunk. It ain't a Ferari, but I'm pretty sure it can bury the needle (140MPH), not that you would ever want to go that fast, right?!
The transmission is tight, and the suspension is built to handle. You can take most 30MPH turns at 70 if you want, and even the stock tires grip wet and snowy roads great. Front Wheel Drive makes the wheel a little squirrely on a hard acceleration, especially since the steering is very tight...don't over correct!
The Infinity Stereo is great...CD, Cassette and AM/FM, 6 speakers. No tapes eaten, no CD's skipping...good reception in weak areas. The Fog lights are cool looking, but you can't use them without the headlights on...You can only use them with Low-Beams...they turn off and on automatically when you switch from Hi to Low beams.
The Hatchback is great, and the split fold down seats let you stuff a lot more than you'd think you could into this little car. You definitely don't want to be riding in the back seat if you're over 5 ft tall, but who wants to ride in back anyway? 
Gas mileage is close to estimates...28 HWY/25 City average. I've run it till the gas light is REALLY ON, and max. range is about 360 miles (don't blame me if you run out of gas trying to prove me wrong!).
The cup holder is great for coffee mugs with handles, but the rubber insert base tends to stick to cans and Burger King cups and pull out. The glove compartment only holds 8 CD's, and the center console was not designed for CD's at all.
No maintenance issues yet...but it's only 7K/7MO old. I have heard there is a recall on the instrument cluster, though I've had no problems. Check with the dealer...
