            I am a single mother over 40 with teenage daughters and animals and I live in the country.  For me, the Dodge Durango has been an answer to prayer.  It is very heavy and durable, drives well, corners well off road and on and has been very reliable.  I have had no services required other than the standard maintenance and have had needed no repairs. It is a comfortable ride for me, the driver, as well as the youngest who sit in the rearmost seats.  It has remarkable pickup especially for a vehicle of its size and weight.  It has surpassed my expectations and any comparisons made to my previous vehicles.  Compared with the Honda Passport and Nissan Pathfinder, I find it heavier and more stable with better pickup and cornering capability.  Compared with the Dodge Caravan and Toyota Corolla wagon, it is more comfortable by far and more practical.  I found two faults with it.  No, it is not perfect! One is that the gas mileage is very poor, no more that 15m to the gallon which in todays gas market is not a plus. Also, the side mirrors are quite large and thus give greater visibility.  However, they also create a blind spot on both sides of the vehicle.  Until I adjusted to compensate for their size and the loss of visibility, there were some scary moments.  All in all, I would highly recommend this vehicle especially as a family transporter.  It serves our needs comfortably and safely and has a good sound system to listen to while we are on our way.  <br><br>
