            Pontiac is marketing their new cars as fuel for your soul. While the Grand Am is fun to drive is it truly fuel for your soul? 

My Experience:
I purchased my 2002 Grand Am SE1 by trading in my former 2001 Saturn SC2. The dealership experience was terrible. I came in knew exactly what I wanted and knew how much it costs. Several attempts were made to talk me into lower cars such as the Sunfire, Mazda Prot�g�, and Protege5. I would avoid any dealership like this because your service experience won&#146t be much better.

Overview:
The 2002 Grand Am SE's offer a new 4 cylinder engine (L61) called the Ecotec. While the outgoing Quad 4 had 150 hp I guarantee that the 140 hp engine will exceed your expectations. It offers smooth responsive acceleration. Something that was fairly rough with the Quad 4.Other updates include the new chrometech wheel upgrade for the SE1. Which are alloy wheels covered with a plastic chrome cover. While some people criticize this because they are not true chrome, they are excellent! They can easily be cleaned by using a rag and wiping the dirt off. And if they get scuffs, they can be replaced for around 50$ at the dealership. This is something usually seen on the higher end cars. I recommend this option.

Pricing:
While pricing can be negotiated, the base price of the SE is around 18K. A fairly loaded model will cost around 21K. This will include the upgraded 200 watt monsoon sound system with Cd and cassette and 8 speakers (actually 6 with rear dual voice coil speakers) sunroof, 16&#148 Chrometech wheels, and a power driver seat.

Safety:
Safety is questionable...The grand am is based on the 1999 model and does not offer the safety features of most cars available now such as side impact or head curtain air bags.

Security:
The Grand Am provides security using theftlock and passlock systems. That disables the cars ignition. It however does not have any type of advanced alarm system that has door or window triggers. Someone can brake into your car and steal things without any type of alarm system activation. I recommend an aftermarket security system.

Interior:
The interior follows the Pontiac&#146s bold styling. The gauges are driver positioned for easy adjustment during driving. The red gauges are very pleasant at night and cause no eye strain. The seats are supportive and comfortable even on long trips. The heating ducts are round and can almost be rotated 360 degrees. Some of the use of plastics such as the door handles and the stereo trim seem a little cheap and could have been replaced with higher quality materials. Both front and back legroom is excellent I am about 6'1 and was comfortable in the front and rear of the car. I actually prefer the rear. The sound system was excellent. The monsoon unit provides speed sensitive volume that goes up and down depending on your car's speed. The speakers fill the cabin with a great quality sound that is quite pleasing for a factory system.
Exterior:
While the Grand Am isn&#146t for everyone it offers a sporty package without a high price. The trunk mounted spoiler looks good but at times can block your view. The new Alero style mirrors look great. 

Ride Quality:
No noises in here. The Grand Am offers a smooth quiet ride. I have had no issues with wind or vibrations. The car does have a tendency to suffer from torque steer (which means under heavy acceleration, the car will slightly move) Also it seems to like to move with dips in the road. I don&#146t know if its the tires or the car. Acceleration was great and responsive. It comes with a 5 speed manual (which can be hard to find, its only made in limited quantities) and a 4 speed automatic (which is what I have) The transmission shifts very smooth and is a great match for the Ecotec engine. For those who want more power though the car comes available with an upgrade to the 3400 OHV pushrod V6 engine which is rated at 170 hp in the SE. Surprisingly enough this upgrade is less than $1,000.

The one issue I have had with my Grand Am one is warped rotors ( a common GM problem) Be prepared to face this problem around every 9-14K miles or just replaced them with an aftermarket set and the problem will go away.
