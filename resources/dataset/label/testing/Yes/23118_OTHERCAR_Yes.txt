                 I bought my Stratus used in 98 with a little over 20k miles on it.  I was initially very pleased with the car.  It was comfortable, quick, and relatively quiet.  I even managed to get the Chrysler dealer that I bought it from to give me back the floor mats for free.  Why they took them out and tried to sell the car without them in the first place escapes me.  
     My only really bad gripe with this car is the head gasket.  I'd never owned a new car prior to this one, so when I saw a little oil on the back of the engine, I thought nothing of it.  I should have walked away right then.  For future reference, if you see an oil leak on a car with less than 50k miles on it, run!  Things went ok for a while but suddenly got worse.  The minor oil leak turned into about a quart per day.  Let's do the math.  Engine holds 4 quarts.  Ignore the oil light for more than about 3 days and you just ruined the engine.  Next contestant please.  It turned out to be a failed head gasket and cost about $500 in parts and labor to replace.  The only reason I got off this easy is that I am careful about maintenance.  The kicker is this:  I am a car mechanic.  I happen to know that head gaskets almost never fail unless there is a reason.  The main reason is overheating.  This did not happen to my car.  My head gasket failed all by itself.  In my quest to figure out what the devil was going on I got wind that there were a lot of head gaskets being replaced.  The bottom line is that the thing is defective.  There is a Chrysler service bulletin about this.  While it doesn't say that the old one is defective, it is a procedure for installing an &quot;improved&quot; one.  All well and good.  The proper thing would be for Chrysler to recall the car for this problem.  They have not.  They HAVE recalled the cars for several other reasons involving safety and emissions.  The Recall numbers are: 843, 789, 803, 7931, and 7932.  I am still very happy with this car, but really wish that Chrysler would step up and take responsibility.  To my knowledge, this is not a problem with the V-6 models.  Only with 4-cyl Stratus/Breeze and Neon models.<br><br>
