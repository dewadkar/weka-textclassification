             In November 1999 on Thanksgiving, early in the AM ,my two daughters and a son-in-law left Duette, FLA. to go to Wal-Mart in Plant City, FLA. The purpose of this early morning excursion was to purchase a birthday gift for my wife.                                                        upon leaving Wal-mart at 2:30 AM, the weather having turned very bad (misting rain and extremely foggy ), my oldest ,who was driving, made a wrong turn onto a dead-end road on the outskirts of Plant City. Approximately one half mile down this road the road made a 45 degree turn to the right. With visibility at 10 feet and excessive speed for conditions, my daughter did not make it through the curve! The Durango left the highway and 10 feet onto the shoulder, struck an electrical utility pole 16 inches square made of concrete, shearing the pole but stopping the Durango as the pole fell across the passenger side of the vehicle !         Amazingly all three occupants walked away from the accident with minor scrapes and bruises !                    I praise the Durango so highly because none of the occupants were wearing seatbelts, both airbags deployed perfectly, and having struck a light pole, head on at 45 to 50 mph and suffering 19 inches of impact crush damage, the firewall and windshield WERE NOT damaged! This vehicle by insurance estimate received $17000. in damages AND is being rebuilt including a new frame !                              By the grace of GOD and the expertise of the Dodge safety engineers, my daughters and son-in-law are alive today !  I don't care what the consumer safety council says, in my book the Dodge Durango gets 5 STARS! What a classy vehicle!   Thanks again, DODGE ( A MOPAR fan for life ! )<br><br>
