            Recently I purchased the 1999 Ford Explorer XLT. I am a new mom and I seem to need much more room in my car than ever.  My husband and I looked at many SUV's and the ones we liked the best was the Explorer.  The trunk has lots of cargo space, the XLT also drives really well and it really feels so safe to be in.  We were critical of the many trucks out there because the cargo space was limited on most.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee has a spare in the back, the Toyota 4runner is over priced, the Honda Passport is too small and so is the Pathfinder.  

The Explorer XLT is moderately priced and you get a lot for your money.  the only downfall I have seen since I purchased the vehicle is that it has had frequent recalls.  In the year I have owned the Explorer, there have been 3 recalls issued. I have mixed feelings about the recalls, but I know Ford handles them with ease and they are on top of their safety issues.  How many other manufacturers are so on top of their car's safety?

I love my Explorer, and as my family continues to grow, we'll just grow with our Fords, maybe the Expedition is next!!<br><br>
