            I bought this car about a year ago as a trip car. I found a lightly used (95,000 miles) Cartier that was perfect cosmetically. I must say that I never intend to buy another &quot;economy&quot; car!!

First off, COMFORT!!!! The seats in this car are 6 way adjustable, and are more comfortable than the sofa in my living room. The electronic dash, while not ultra-modern, is not Buck Rogerish, and is well laid out. Controls make sense, and everything (except the radio) is where it makes sense (radio is too low in the dash--should be up higher, where it is easier to adjust).

As others have said, the ride is phenomenal. The air shocks smooth over even the roughest roads. The speed dependent power steering alleviates some road feel, but not as much as you would expect. The power is not great, but is misleading--as quiet and smooth as the ride is, it is hard to tell the difference between 80 and 50 except on the speedometer,

Caveats--repairs. Repairs on this vehicle cost more than similar repairs on Ford vehicles. Parts are correspondingly higher. I have had to have the transmission replaced (and have heard that is common at about 100,000 miles). The power windows on the driver's side has failed. The power antenna has failed. These, of course, are things that happen to all vehicles, particularly at 100,000+ miles.

All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase, and when I trade, I expect to buy another vehicle of this class.<br><br>
