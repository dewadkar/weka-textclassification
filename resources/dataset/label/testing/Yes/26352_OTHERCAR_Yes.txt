            I had a digital camera when the digitals first came out on the market. It was slow, bulky, and it used up batteries in a matter of minutes.

So, when shopping for a new camera, I wanted something fast and I wanted something light and compact. I take a lot of close-up shots of documents and needed to be able to read them on the computer. With Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 I got all that.

If purchasing the camera, it is a must to buy the Super-Quick pack. It comes with a case, super-quick charger (takes a little over an hour to charge the batteries) and an extra set of batteries. After getting the extra pack, hide the charger that came with the camera as it takes a whole day to charge the batteries!

Also, you will need a larger memory stick. The one that comes with the camera does not hold many photos.

I took this camera on a week vacation and had it on almost constantly, using the LCD viewer always. I had to recharge batteries every second day and never had a problem.

I took it to the Botanical gardens and got close shots of flowers (and bees on the flowers). They all looked great! The max resolution setting provides a clear 11x17!

Just plug this camera into a USB port (it comes with a cable) to download your photos. My computer had no problem recognizing the camera and a new little icon popped up in "My Computer" when I turned it on connected to the computer. I copied and pasted the photos in their own little folder and was able to open them in my graphics program.

I also like being able to review photos on the television. It was great slideshow tool for a grandmother with failing eyesight!

I did not find the zoom that impressive, but I do not use it a lot. Another special feature is the movie mode. It proves to be a fun plaything but movies are small and at a low resolution. You have to be close to the object and in well lighted conditions to use the movie mode.

I have seen this camera down to $350 in stores now and some stores offer free items (such as a memory stick) with purchase.
