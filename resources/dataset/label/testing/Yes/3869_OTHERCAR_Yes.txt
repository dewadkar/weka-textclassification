            This is a great vehicle!!  We purchased our 1999 Plymouth Voyager brand new for about $19,000 as a base model with a few added features.  We have two children and always have enough room.  

Driver Side Passenger Door
Our van came equipped with a driver side passenger door which is a great feature when you have two children in car seats.  It saves a lot on the back!!!

Removable Bench Seats
The van has a short seat that will seat two people and a seat that will seat three people.  They are both removable and interchangable for positioning.  We use the three seater seat a lot in the middle and keep the other seat out of the van for more space in the back and allows the children to sit farther apart (for fighting purposes).  Installed in the van the seats also fold to a flat position to allow larger items in without removing the seats.  

Cup Holders
We have cup holders to hold 6 drinks throughout the van.  There are two up front that are adjustable to hold large or small cups (even supersize at McDonalds), two that slide out from the bottom center of the smaller bench seat (also adjustable), and one on each side of the van in the back (not adjustable).

Luggage Rack
Great for extra luggage space, always needed with a family.

Tinted Windows
People always say why would own a minivan and worry about tinted windows. Well a few reasons are it protects the interior of your van from sun damage and it also helps provide a barrier for sun shining in on your childrens eyes (no need for a sun shade).

AC Adaptor
This is great!  The van comes equipped with two adaptors, one in the front where a cigarette lighter would normally be and another in the rear of the van.  Can be used for multiple purposes.

Security Drawer
There is a drawer under the passenger seat that has a lock for personal belongings.  The van comes with a valet key that can open and turn the car on but cannot open the drawer.  Great feature!

Other Features 
Air conditioning
AM/FM Cassette player
Automatic door locks
V6 Engine (great power)
Driver and passenger side airbags
Tilt Wheel

Like I said its a great vehicle and I would recommend it to anybody.  It is a very comfortable and quiet ride and gets pretty good gas mileage compared to alot of the SUV's.  The only bad thing I have to say is that its hard to control a comfortable climate for the whole van because the only vents are in the front on the dashboard.
