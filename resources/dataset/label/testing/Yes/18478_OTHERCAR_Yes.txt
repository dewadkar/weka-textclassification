            I absolutely adore my Sebring LXi!  Aside from it's gorgeous looks, it truly drives like a dream.  My previous car was a Honda Accord.  In comparing the two, the Sebring has more of a sports car feel.  It really hugs turns, it's lower to the ground, it has tighter steering and it's much quicker!  I went from a 4-door to a 2-door, which I was nervous about but I actually like it more.  I am newly married, without children so I don't need 4-doors.  

I am pretty car savvy, but not as far as the engine and mechanics are concerned.  I just know that I really do love this car as much today as I did when I got it almost 2 years ago.  The car had approximately 28,000 miles on it then and since I commute a great distance to work... I now have a little more than double that mileage.  It has been extremely reliable.

Maintenance of this car has been a piece of cake.  Lucky for me, my husband knows a pretty good deal about that stuff.  He changes the oil every 3,000 miles and he also does other great stuff, such as replacing the breaks, etc.  But other than that type of routine maintenance, I have not had any problems with it at all.  And since we live in the Chicago-area, this car takes a major beating in the frigid and salty winters.

You know when you first get a new car and you look back at it everytime you park and walk away?  Two years later and I still do that!  The car is absolutely gorgeous!  I removed the license plate housing from the front bumper and when the fog-lamps are on, the car is smokin!  My car is white on silver, exactly like the picture above... I just adore the looks of it.

There is one MINOR thing that I would change about my car, the trunk opening is decent but not great.  The actual trunk size is terrific, but the opening for it could be bigger.  But really, it is such a minor issue that wouldn't have influenced me had I known before I owned the car.  Also, I think they compensated for the small trunk opening by making fold-down back seats.  You can always fit larger items in that way.

The Sebring has hundreds of excellent features that are more important than the trunk opening.  The general size of the car is ideal.  The exterior is long and pretty wide, which makes for a safe feeling.  Inside, the back seat passengers have a surprising amount of room, even with tall people in front.  It seats 4 very comfortably.  

The car was obviously designed for MAXIMUM comfort.  I spend a lot of time in my car commuting and I have no complaints.  The dash and air/radio controls are all within easy reach, it is basically rounded around your seat.  The appearance of the dash of the car is neat!  The speedometer and other gauges are illuminated in orange at night, which is different than the common blue that I had in my Honda.  And I have really enjoyed the moonroof, I would recommend getting that for sure.  Also, mine came with a tape player/stereo and I had a Pioneer CD player/stereo installed and kept the original speakers - I would recommend it, the original speakers sound like I had new ones installed.  Now, my commutes to work and school are relaxing with my CD's playing.  If the radio is off, the car gives  such a quiet ride that I could fall asleep!

If you are thinking about buying a Chrysler Sebring LXi, I would definitely encourage those thoughts!  It's an excellent way to reward yourself.  You'll enjoy driving this elegantly sporty, gorgeous car.  To show you how highly I recommend this great car... I am actually considering buying another when the time comes.  One test drive will win you over, I guarantee you'll enjoy it.
