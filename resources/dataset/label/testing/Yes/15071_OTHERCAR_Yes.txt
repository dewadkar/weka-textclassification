            I'll be the first to admit that I was leery of getting a digital camera.  I love my 35mm camera and the feel and look of real photographs!  On the other hand, I found myself more and more using my own scanner to scan photos and then e-mailing images; I'm not willing to pay the surcharges to get the extra Kodak processing choices to have this done for me and scanning does take time.  

So, we borrowed this camera from my husband's work to get a feel for it.  It is bulkier than I'm used to and using the large square field to line up your shot (you have to hold it in front of you instead of the typical view through an eye-piece snug to your face) definitely takes some getting used to.  Alternately, storing images on floppies that I can then plop into my (or anyone else's) computer and immediately pull up, mail and alter is great!  Also, the ability to zoom easily up to 10X and it's ease of taking images in low light situations is an advantage.

Another plus is that it is straightforward to use.  In a matter of minutes I was able to master much of what I use regularly.  

This is not a camera for everyone and if you want a straightforward, easy-to-use digital camera that stores images on floppies, I can recommend this one.
