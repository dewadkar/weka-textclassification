            Well I bought my Protege in Feb of 99, and base model that is.  A 1999 Mazda Protege DX.  I have owned new cars my whole life, I have dodge Neons, Dakota, Ram, Tempo, and Ford Probe.  I have had new cars my whole life, and when I purchased my Protege, I was very excited about that.  I had an accident a month after I bought my Protege, I brought it to the dealership, and they were just so helpful and willing to do anything to get me back into my car, after the 3,000 bill, my car ran even better, I am very pleased with my car, in fact i'm getting ready to do something I have never done before, i'm going to trade my car in for the newest model the 2000 Mazda protege.  One last thing I think you'll like, is all protege's, regardless of model, comes equipped with a CD player, your teenager will love that.  It is a safe vehicle as well, lots of cab space, drives very smooth, all and all it is a very nice car!!!
