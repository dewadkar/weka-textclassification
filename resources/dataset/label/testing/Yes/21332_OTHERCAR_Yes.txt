            I searched for months for a reliable, affordable car with a professional look. I read everything I could get my hands on and spent endless hours test-driving, walking around car lots and listening to sales pitches. At long last, I finally realized that the Camry won hands down. I've now had my '99 Camry LE for 6 months and I'm still in love with it. 

The Camry is incredibly roomy without being a monstrous car. While looking for a new car, I wanted something large enough to hold anything I needed to throw in, but small enough for me to manage easily. I travel extensively, and have no trouble getting all of my luggage in the trunk. The back seat is large enough to seat three people comfortably while the front seat passengers have plenty of leg room. 

I'm only 5'2&quot; and sometimes have trouble with larger cars, but nothing about the Camry is out of reach. The dashboard controls are easily accessible, but don't get in the way. 

The handling is wonderful. I can even parallel park this car!! It is great on long trips and on the highway, and isn't cumbersome in stop-and-go traffic either. 

I haven't had any trouble at all with my car or the Toyota company and I would strongly recommend this car to drivers of any age, in any location. <br><br>
