            I purchased my beloved Corolla Feb 2001 from the anti-christ of car dealerships, Neil Toyota of Lynbrook, NY. I was desperate for a vehicle to drive to work on my newly minted license. After signing my life away to Toyota Motor Finance, I drove my little black car home to the folks. It was an instant hit, with plenty of room, four doors, and a trunk so big the mafia could make great use of it in hiding bodies. Its rather amazing how much room they were able to squeeze out of the smallish, utilitarian looking body. 

I was lucky enough to get the CE with the 5 speed manual. I would NOT recommend this car in this model year without the manual transmission. With a mere 95 ft-lbs or torque and a meager 100 hp to haul 2400 lbs. of car around, the automatic transmission, in my view, is vastly inadequate. In 1998 the 1ZZ engine replaced the 4AFE and 15 more horses closely followed.

The Corolla's road manners are adequate though rather noisy at highway speeds. The air conditioning will take considerable power away from the already small engine making lane changes a sometimes tricky affair if you don't keep track of the a/c compressor cycle. Handling is good, but the rack and pinion steering is a little over-assisted, giving it the large Ford sedan feel (turn the wheel with once finger deal)at low speeds. The steering wheel is large and very comfortable though there are about 3 turns from lock to lock. The suspension is greatly improved from earlier years through the use of McPhearson struts that improve ride quality, but some body roll in turns is present.

The interior is very functional and well built in typical Toyota tradition. The seats and interior cloth trim are aesthetically pleasing while not making much of a personality statement. The front buckets are comfortable for shorter trips (100 miles or less). Sitting in them for more than 5 hours is a pain in the butt (literally). I made a trip from my home in NY to my school in North Dakota driving 10-15 hours a day and I can honestly state that this car is not for long distances. The lack of cruise control was a contributing factor, though I believe it was an option in the '97 model year for both the manual and automatic transmissions. The stock stereo system is actually quite good, producing surprising power in highs and lows through stock speakers. Unless you need a CD player in the dash, there really is no reason to replace this already VERY adequate system.

In May '01 I was in an accident with the car in a parking lot due to my own idiocy. I was cutting though a parking spot to exit the lot when I was slammed by a Jeep Cherokee going about 10 mph. The impact destroyed the front end and distorted the unibody an astonishing 8 inches. The reason for this gross distortion was previous crash damage the dealer never told me about (I could go on and on about this dealership, but I won't). The total bill was about $6,700 coming within 100 dollars of totaling the vehicle. After it was fixed it was back to normal and I haven't had a problem since. 

Regular maintenance can get pricey if you aren't under a pre-paid maintenance program. The 60,000 mile inspection that I have due soon will cost almost 400 dollars to replace a timing chain and other items. Foreign cars are expensive to maintain properly, and that's what you get for the better quality they afford you.

All in all I would highly recommend this vehicle to first time car buyers and people who require a utilitarian vehicle that can get them from A to B without fail every single time they need to go.
