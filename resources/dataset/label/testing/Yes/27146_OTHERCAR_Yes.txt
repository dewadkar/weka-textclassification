            We own a 1994 Dodge 2500 Ram Van.  We purchased it December, 1994.  Our Ram Van was a pre-owned vehicle with approximately 18,000 miles on it.  I believe we paid about $19,000.

We visit Chevy, Ford, Plymouth, Dodge and maybe a few foreign makers to find a vehicle that my four children, husband and I could be comfortable in.  It was important to find a vehicle that my husband could sit up in without hitting his head on the ceiling and we need leg room for our children too, the eldest was approaching six foot fast.  Other makes of vans had no head room, leg room and no storage space for luggage, etc.  We needed a vehicle we could use to travel or visit friends and relatives in. 

I love my Ram Van because I feel safe in it - and I feel my children are safe too, especially when we travel on the highways.  Our Ram Van drives well.  And our Ram Van has the room we need with the space we need for luggage, or to move large items.

There are a few things I hate about my Ram Van:  1. The paint is peeling. 2. The gas gauge has not worked since 1996.  3. it is a gas hog.  

BUT MY SAFETY MEANS SO MUCH TO ME THAT IT FAR OUTWEIGHS THE REST AND THE PAINT, GAS GAUGE AND GAS CONSUMPTION HAVE NO EFFECT ON HOW IT DRIVES - GREAT.

When I am driving my Ram Van I am very comfortable.  My children have the space they need - to play, read, sleep or whatever.  More important, when my husband drives the van - has has the room he needs, and he is 6'5&quot; tall and 300 pounds -- but he is comfortable (the ram is the only van we could find at the time that he could fit into and feel comfortable).

Who should buy this vehicle???  Anyone that wants to drive in comfort should buy this vehicle.  The ram van is great for anyone who need more room when they travel or visit relatives, especially when traveling long distances.

Don't buy this vehicle if you don't want or need all the room the Ram Van 2500 has to offer.

AS FOR ME - - I'LL KEEP MY DODGE VAN.<br><br>
