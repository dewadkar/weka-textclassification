            I recently bought a 99 Civic Coupe EX automatic and I must admit that I love every moment I spend in it. The EX model comes standard with dual airbags, air conditioning, power windows, power locks, cruise control, power moonroof, CD player with 6 speakers, and a remote entry system. ABS is an option. The EX's 127-HP SOHC VTEC inline-4 engine deserves a lot of praise. It is fuel-efficient and quiet when idle. But when the VTEC system kicks in, this engine SCREAMS! The interior is OK in the front but gets a bit cramped in the back and the seats are comfy for only a couple of hours. The brakes are decent but not great (disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the back). From its beefy front end to the half-red half-white tailights, the exterior looks really nice!! I think the Civic looks the nicest in its class and that's one of the reasons why I bought this car. If you want a little more room and more power, you might want to consider an Accord but the Civic is a great car for the average driver looking to find a reliable car at a cheap price. Honda has once again proved itself worthy in the sub-compact category with the new Civic.


For people looking for a little more zing, Honda offers the newly re-introduced &quot;rice-rocket&quot; version of the Civic, the Si. The Si comes with a 160-HP DOHC VTEC inline-4 engine that smokes the competition. The Si comes standard with 4-wheel disc brakes, HV shock absorbers, front and rear stabilizer bars, and 15&quot; alloy wheels. The Si only comes with a 5-speed transmission and has only 3 available colors: red, black, and blue. The Si is aimed for the young audience and is a EXCELLENT car to drive. For the weekday driver and weekend racer, the Civic Si is the car for you.<br><br>
