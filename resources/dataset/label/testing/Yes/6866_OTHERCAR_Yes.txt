            I will admit that the main reason that I bought the Hyundai Elantra was because my husband was impressed by the warranty.  It was not my first choice, I wanted something bigger because my other half is 6'4&quot; and has a hard time fitting in most cars.  To our amazement, he fits in this car with no problem.  He doesn't have to turn sideways to stretch his legs on trips (which makes my trip much more enjoyable).  The Elantra has more horse power than any of the other cars in it's class.  This means faster acceleration with excellent handling as well.  It also comes standard with overdrive and a switch for added horsepower for passing or going up hills.  I would recommend the option of a rear spoiler, it comes with a brake light across the top.  I've noticed other Elantras in traffic and they are much easier to see when braking.  The only thing I don't like about the Elantra is the size of the gas tank.  It is small and so that makes for frequent stops for fuel.  Overall, I am giving this car an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up.<br><br>
