            Okay, so I wasn't even looking to buy a car, I just was having a fun time shopping.  I had started out just wanting to see the new cars and I was sort of thinking I needed a new car.  Heck, I was driving a 1988 Mazda 323 with 153,000 miles and the poor thing was getting on.  I loved my Mazda and would have kept it, but with the amount of miles I drive I needed to find a newer car and so I began to shop...but I was only shopping.

I had been to the Mercedes dealer, the BMW dealer, VW, Toyota, Mazda and now I was looking at the Saturn.  I really liked the BMW Z3 but it wasn't really practical for me.  I did not like the Toyota Echo, or for that matter any of the new Toyota's...and Mazda was in the same boat.  I was thinking that I would either get a used Mercedes or a new car, and then I saw the Saturn SL.

I had a list of things that I wanted from a new car.  It had to be a stick, it had to get good mileage (gas prices being high), it had to look good and drive good.  I didn't want to spend a fortune (okay so I was looking at the Z3 but I didn't buy it).  I wanted my car insurance to still be affordable and it would also be nice if the car had safety features.

My test drive at Saturn was the best.  I had the best salesperson, he knew more about the car than I even wanted to know.  He told me everything I could want to know...and then gave me the "E" ticket test drive.  It was something to see how the car could handle.  Being that I am the worst when it comes to a stick, well let's just say that I am hard on the clutch and I can forget to put the clutch in first and then shift.  Well not often but it happens. Well the Saturn is very forgiving.  I was impressed when I was able to make the car move forward at a dead stop with no gas and letting out the clutch in 5th gear.  Yep that's right the car didn't die it went forward.  I was also impressed how the car stopped almost on a dime, and it hugged the road on a curve marked 25 mph and we were going 45 mph.

The car performed great and it looked good too.  I didn't want bells and whistles, I like simple.  I got the bare bones model, no electric windows or alarms.  The only things I wanted on the car was my stick shift and A/C..but it also came with a CD radio.  The cost was great too, and strange for me to know that the price was not negotiable.  I am used to the price game you play at other car dealers...and I have been known to argue over $100.00.  Well not this time, I knew that what was marked was what I would pay.  My car priced out at $14, 026.00 and with finance charges it will end up being $14,350.00.  

There were three things that closed the deal for me.  First, the price could be financed for .09% for 5 years, so it was almost like having no finance cost.  Second my car insurance rate would only increase by $100 for the year, and third, they had the car in my color, blue.

I was so excited by the Saturn that we didn't just buy one car we bought three.  See the SC1 epinion about my hubby's car.  Yep, I got a new car and so did the hubby and we even got a car for my niece.  She bought the SL1 because she had to have an automatic.

It was a little nuts buying three new cars and selling three old cars and all in 10 days, but that is another story.  Anyway I loved the overall Saturn experience.  We have had the cars not quite a month, and we are learning to love them even more.  I even have to tell ya that my new Saturn saved my life just the other night.  Remember when I said they can almost stop on a dime, well we were in traffic and the car in front came to a sudden stop, and it was so quick that I barely had time to stop myself.  I jammed the brakes on and the car came to a sudden stop with just a slight shift in the steering.  Had I been in my Mazda and done that move, I would have been thrown into the center divider and probably hit the car in front and might even have flipped over.  But my new Saturn handled it well and other than shaking for a few moments at how closed we came, we were also thankful that the car did so well.

I must also recommend if you decide to get a Saturn to spend the little extra and get the Saturn Car Care extend maintenance contract.  We got the one for 5 years or 60,000.  It covers everything you could want in the major fix area and then it also includes all oil changes for the next 5 years or 60,000 and a lot of other really minor things, like windshield wipers, hoses, belts, but not tires.  It means that for at least the next 5 years all I have to do is put gas in the car.  I am just loving this.

Overall, I can highly recommend the Saturn experience and unless something major happens to change my mind I do believe I have been converted.  Well let me say that the whole family is converted, there are now 4 Saturn's in our family.  My other niece bought hers 4 years ago, and still loves her car.  The Saturn company knows about customer service and that made the deal.  If you are looking, or just shopping like I was, you need to check out the Saturn.
