            Yesterday I had the unfortunate and unexpected task of having to take my mother to see a specialist in the a big city that is 150+ miles away. She and I both were very anxious about having to go such a distance and to return the same day after spending no telling how long at the doctor's office.  My brother suggested that we rent a car, to help ease some of the physical problems associated with traveling. It proved to be a great idea, as our old Ford truck just would not be the ticket!!

My trusted car rental advisor suggested we try the economy size Ford Contour. What great advise!! Our trip was very rewarding and comfortable the whole way.

The compact size of the car made tidbits of the big city driving. Very easy to whip around the downtown street traffic, and the power steering and power brakes features never let me down, when confronted with obstacles! The slick design and the vibrant white color was pleasing to the eye and soothing against the bright sunrays. The design of the dashboard allowed the driver to concentrate on the driving, but also easily accessible to the heater/air controls, the radio, the vents, the wiper controls, and the lighting controls. The only thing not easily accessible was the trip meter; too difficult to get my hand through the area to reset the meter. Another inconvience, and one that I found very irritating all during the trip, was the poorly designed steering wheel in relation to the cruise controls. My hands kept bumping the cruise control buttons and kept turning off or resetting the cruise settings. Very irritating.

All in all, I enjoyed driving this little car. However, I do not think that it would be very comfortable for very long, extended trips.<br><br>
