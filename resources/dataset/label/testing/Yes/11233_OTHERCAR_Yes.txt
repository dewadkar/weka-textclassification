              I am the owner of a 2003 Suzuki Aerio SX, which is a "crossover" small wagon/small SUV and is very distinct in appearance. Since owning the car, I have been amazed at the very large number of people who stare at it, people who walk up to it when it's parked, and people who ask me questions about it! I am pleased with the vehicle so far, and I've recommended it to several others, and at least one of them purchased one. There are a lot of similar cars, such as Toyota Matrix and one version of Ford Focus, but the Aerio SX is still rare enough to attract a lot of attention.

 I bought this vehicle primarily because of the ease in entering and exiting as my wife has physical problems which make ordinary vehicles very painful for her to travel in.
The Aerio is as comfortable as an SUV in this respect, and for a small vehicle it has a lot of room in both the front seats and the back. I've been able to travel comfortably with 2 adults in front and 2 in the back. The Aerio has a peppy 4 cylinder engine that can crank out 140 horsepower. There's a standard 5 speed (stick on the floor) transmission and all kinds of modern goodies such as a digital speedometer, digital odometer with 2 trip mileage features and the ability to switch the whole thing to metric readings including a digital speedometer readout in kilometers. This is very distracting at first as there are constantly changing lights on the dashboard. I've gotten used to this now.

 The stereo system is very good and there is a 6 disc storage feature accompanying the radio. I have noticed that the AM radio doesn't pick up distant stations as well as some radios I've had on other vehicles, but the sound quality is good. A few other features that are standard:
 Rear window defogger and wiper
 Daytime running lights-I have mixed feelings about this one!
 Extra carrying space as rear seats fold down
 Fog lights 
 Air conditioning-Ice Cold!
 Cruise control
 Power locks with keyless entry
 
 The Suzuki maintenance schedule is not complicated and seems sensible as well as affordable. There's a 3 year/36000 mile warrantee that covers virtually everything except maintenance and a transferrable 7 year/70,000 mile power train warrantee. My only problem here is that I seem to be heading for 36,000 miles a lot quicker than 36 months-that's a pretty good indication that I'd have a problem with a lease!
 A negative! Taking off from a parking spot or in traffic in 1st gear the engine bucks and jumps under 10 mph unless I over-accelerate. I don't know where I read it, but another reviewer found the same problem. I rather feel like it appears I don't quite know how to drive a stick shift when I have to gun the motor to take off, but it beats the alternative! It's really not a good idea to stall in traffic even at a low speed!

 Mileage is generally around 25 mpg city and 35+ on the road, with somewhat lower results with the air conditioning on. 

 Do I recommend this car? Yes, I do! I've had a very good experience driving my Suzuki Aerio SX.
