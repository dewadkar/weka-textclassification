            I purchased this 4 door automatic M3 at 28,000 miles, and the car was certified, - it had the 7 year, 100,000 mile extended warranty. Let me begin the review by stating that this is the best 5 speed automatic transmission sold on a sport-sedan. The vehicle's computer shifts, holds and selects the gears just like you would using a 5 speed manual when used in the sport mode. Don't believe it? Drive one and see. Fuel economy is surprisingly good, I average around 23 m.p.g. and am not light-footed. This car can seat 4 adults, although rear seat comfort is not the best with very firm and thin cushioning in the back. I got manual adjustment seats, - a mistake in my opinion if more than one of you will drive the car. Once you get the seat adjusted, however, the view is perfect out the windshield for performance driving. The steering wheel communicates a road feel not found in any car short of a Ferrari, and the Ferrari is no better. Simply incredible, - you will begin to intuitively know this car's limitations and capabilities driving blindfolded. (Not that you would want to....) The engine pulls strongly right to the redline, and is a screamer from a standstill, and a rocket in the passing lane. One way to sum this up: You will not believe the speedomter when you glance down at it, - &quot;No way am I going this fast!&quot;. At high speed, this car is a rock, and I mean dead-solid. Cornering? This car is glued to the road. Push it, and the car tends to oversteer. So poised is this auto, that merely lifting a tad off the accelerator brings the car's rear end snapping back into line. Don't lift off completely! Braking requires very little pedal effort, with amazing stopping power...as one reviewer put it: &quot;You will be able to stop, but the person behind you may hit you&quot;. This M3 came equipped with the full computer, which includes such functions as outside temp, m.p.g., distance remaining in fuel tank, trip distance, memo reminder, date, time, and speed alarm. The computer also actively checks the entire car's electrical components and engine management system, alerting the driver to failures such as a brake light, headlight, or engine malfunction. One example of a nice touch: the computer sounds an audible alarm when the temperature drops below freezing, warning you to possible icy conditions. Nice! I have tested the car's antilock and traction control system in all kinds of conditions. I'll state here that this is not a winter car. You can drive it in the snow, but slap on some winter tires and watch exiting the corners, even with the traction control system on. (Don't even think about turning this off in the snow!) The rear wheels will beat you in a race (meaning you will spin in an instant). The antilock systems works very well in rain, snow, or loose road surfaces, instilling alot of confidence. Lastly, the car has been extremely relaible, with a good fit and finish. I've had two minor things break on the interior, and the dealer replaced them right away, with no further recurrences. With regards to this review, anything more on the car gets down to driver preferences, such as cabin comfort, etc. I'll leave that up to you, with just a few comments: I love the one touch up &amp; down windows, and the functional sunroof. The stereo system is decent, but I replaced the speakers and added an amplifier, keeping the car's stock head unit as is. Much better! Also, here is a great tip: treat the leather seats once a year with a good leather conditioner, and you will avoid the &quot;elephant wrinkles&quot; commonly found in M3 interiors. The leather stays soft yet plaible, so no creases develop. The head turning factor is still high, at least until the new M3 arrives in the U.S. If your M3 doesn't come with a spoiler, consider adding one because it makes the car's looks<br><br>
