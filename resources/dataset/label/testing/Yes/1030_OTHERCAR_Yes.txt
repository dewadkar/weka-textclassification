              Well, I bought this car in January of 2002 with 77,000 miles on it.  

  My very first impressions were as follows:
-I felt the car had great power for only having a 2.7L and being as large as it is.
-I thought it had a lot of road noise.

  After driving it for over 2 years now.  I can say that overall this has been an excellent car.  The trunk space is huge.  I can fit my hockey bags and sticks in the trunk, plus a sub box holding two 12" speakers.  I myself am a car stereo buff and the interior of the car is perfect for a system. The rears hold 6x9's and the doors hold 6.5's.  I would recommend separates for the front's.  The styling of the car is excellent inside and out.  The seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of leg and headroom for rear passengers.  The a/c kicks butt. 

  The only complaint I have, it's a major one, is that the engine blew at 105K on me.  I take extremely well care of my cars and this was a shocker to me.  In fairness I have know idea how well it was cared for before me, I did buy it with 77K on it already.  But I have read up on the 2.7L for the "LH" cars and it seems like they are a problem engine.  They are also VERY expensive to replace.  It cost me $5000 to have a new engine installed and that was the cheapest of the 6 quotes I received.  My Uncle is a mechanic and he wouldn't even touch it.
