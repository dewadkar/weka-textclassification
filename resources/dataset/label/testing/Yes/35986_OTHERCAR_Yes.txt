            1/6/03 UPDATE:  Overall gas mileage is about 14-16 mpg.  For city driving it runs 13-14 mpg and highway ranges from 18-22 mpg depending on driving conditions (hills, speed etc.).  Your mileage is very dependent upon your driving style (lead foot, etc.) and what type of driving you do (stop and go vs open road).  The truck has an "Instant Economy" feature that tells you at any given moment what your gas mileage is.  To get this truck up to speed with conservative acceleration, you only get 4-5 mpg.  It takes a lot to get this beast going.

Well, in my case the answer is no.  But, the 2WD version of the Chevy Silverado 1500HD rides as high or higher than most stock 4WD models.

The previous reviewer stated all facts that I totally agree with as I have owned the 2WD version of this vehicle for about two weeks now.

I only differ in opinion with the previous reviewer in the remark about paying a little bit more for 4WD so just get it.  The 4WD models I looked at ran about $7,000.00 more.  And I don't think that just getting leather and 4 X 4 would really warrant this difference in price.  I won't even mention the difference in your insurance rates.  If you need 4WD and plan to use that feature, then by all means get it.  For most of us, though, the normal justification for buying a 4WD model to increase the clearance is really not a valid one when you speak of this truck.  The 2WD model, stock, sits higher than many standard 4WD models out on the road today.

The ride is incredible.  Now it won't give you a ride like a Lincoln Navigator or a Cadillac Escalade because it's still a truck and it rides like a truck.  But, I can say the ride is a lot quieter and smoother than trucks from even a couple years ago.  If you want luxury car ride without the bounce, then don't buy a truck.

Mmmmmmmm power.  Wow!  This vehicle has the 6.0 Liter V8 under the hood.  Gas mileage won't be the reason you buy this truck.  They don't even disclose mileage on the sticker due to the engine type.  But, I am averaging about 12-13 miles/gallon in metro Phoenix and between 19-21 miles/gallon on the highway.  And since I have the 4.10 transmission, I can tow up to 10,200 pounds.

The back seat of this truck truly is a crew cab and you have ample room.  I picked this truck over the extended cab model due to the fact that there is a lot more room in the back when you compare an extended cab to a crew cab.

Your price will vary depending upon the options that come with it.

Standard LS package and decor plus the following:

XM Satellite Radio
Locking differential rear axle (an improved posi-traciton)
Six-way power driver seat
Trailer package (which includes a high capacity air filter)
Air condtioning and dual climate control
OSRV Mirrors with driver side auto dimming, power fold and adjustment, heat, tilt & turn signal (yeah they copied Ford)
Deep tinted glass (Arizona must)
Polished aluminum wheels
Steering wheel radio and driver info. controls
AM/FM Stereo w/ CD and Cassette
4.10 ratio rear axle
Recovery hooks
Camper/5th wheel trailer wiring
Spare tire lock

This all summed up to $32,568.00 but you can horsetrade them down as I paid below invoice for the vehicle.  October was truck month!

As stated before, accelleration is very good for a vehicle of this size.  It holds the road well and behaves on the open road.  I love this truck and recommend it to anyone who realizes they won't be getting economy car mileage and will, probably have to take two parking spots as it's rather long and will hang out of it's space when you park at your local Wal-Mart :)

But if you want to ride your family in security and safety and enjoy the ride, I do recommend this vehicle.  With a home policy and multi-car discount, my insurance runs about $78.00/month so it's not cheap but it's not the worst case scenario.

I might, also, mention that the exhaust system on this vehicle is great.  This is a 6 Liter engine and the stock system really keeps the noise down.  You can hear that you have something under the hood but it does not resemble anyting like hot rod sound.

It, also, includes two keyless entry fobs, content theft deterence and a basic alarm system.

To sum it all up, get the luxury and size of an SUV with the ability to haul a new tree for the yard in one beautiful package.  I can't say enough good things about this vehicle.
