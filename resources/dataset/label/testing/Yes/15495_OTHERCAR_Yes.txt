            We bought the Sony MVC-FD88 for our business pictures but it has become an item we use almost everyday! We thought at first that the price was high but we have more than paid for it in picture developing savings and ease of transferring to the computer! No more scanning! We have found the camera  simple to use and very economical to operate! With grandchildren the options are endless. No more dull still pictures! a 5 to 10 second Video clip to friends and family says it all! This camera can be set to shoot in several light settings.

The only thing we can say bad about it is that it doesn't have the ability to rapid shoot so you miss some rapidly occurring &quot;Picture perfect Moments&quot;, however with view screen you don't lose any pictures because you don't know what you have until the pictures are developed!

I don't know of anyone who this camera would not be a benefit to. Business to young families and grandparents!
