            What can i say I love this car.  I loved it so much selling it I bought one.  I traded im my 1998 Prelude and really don't miss it much because my brand new S2000 has lived up to every expectation I have had.  I do have some issues with the car though that hopefully Honda will address in later years.  The car has a lousy factory stereo system with 2 speakers especially compared with the 6 speaker system i loved from the prelude.  I have had the factory speakers swaped out with kenwood sperates and  added an alpine amp and now the system is better than average.  Speakers in the headrest would have been brutally expensive to add, the one custom place i found willing to do it was quoting about 3000 dollars.  I also would have loved to see them add a glove compartment to the car, keeping my reg and owners manual in the pouch on the passengers side of the car is disappointing.  I suggest buying the aero screen to any person considering this car, it really cuts down on backdraft when the top is down.  I love the speed putting the top down but the boot piece is a pain to get off after its put on.  Also living in new england on cold mornings that aluminum shift knob is cold as ice.  Now for the things i love about the car.  The car's handling is fantastic.  The sound of the engine when you crank it up is pure enjoyment.  I also love the attention that driving this car gets you.  Everyone who sees the car loves it.  I bought the silver with black interior as i find i don't like the red interior as much.  The 6 speed shifter is so much fun with miata type short throws.  I also love that the car can be very mild when you want it to be.  The zenon head lights are very bright and annoy the hell out of other drivers but give you nice vision at night and great definition.<br><br>
