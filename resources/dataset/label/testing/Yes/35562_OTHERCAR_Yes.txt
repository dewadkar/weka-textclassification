            The model I am reviewing is a 2001 Honda Civic HX Coupe w/CVT Automatic.  The HX model includes alloy wheels and power locks standard, but is not available in a 4-door or with a moonroof.

The first thing you notice about the new Civics is the changes in style.  In my opinion, the design is more elegant than the older models, but opinions vary on this.  Go see one and make up your own mind!  One thing that cannot be argued, however is the significantly larger interior space honda has managed squeeze into a car this size.  I'm 6'2", and the back seat has plenty of room for me.  The higher ceiling makes getting in and out much easier as well.  There is no "bump" in the middle of the floor in the back seat, either, making the ride more comfortable for the unfortunate middle-seat passenger.  The increase in interior space is also assisted by Honda's use of more compact strut suspension up front (they still use the beloved double wishbone in the rear).  While reviews I read in researching this car were apprehensive about how this would affect handling, I can assure you that Honda has exercised their traditional engineering care with the new suspension, producing a very responsive handling.   Finally, the new body style gives us very a large trunk for a car this size. 

In the HX, a more efficient 1.7L VTEC-E engine (which even produces 117hp instead of the DX/LX 115) brings even the automatic up to 35/40mpg and the manual up to 36/44mpg.  While you do pay a little extra for the HX engine, the economy (and 2 bonus hp!) were worth it in my opinion.  The HX is ULEV certified in all 50 states, making it a responsible choice environmentally without sacrificing fun.  This is no econobox-- but the economy numbers sure make it look that way!

The CVT transmission is interesting.  No gears!  Just a smooth transition as you accelerate.  The feeling of no shifting is unusual at first, but the abrupt RPM change other automatics experience quickly begins to seem old-hat as you get used to the CVT.  Acceleration is very quick and smooth in the CVT, much more so than with a standard automatic, but as always, a good driver with a manual will still beat it.  

In terms of safety, you can't go wrong.  The coupe scored five stars in both front and side collision tests.

As always the factory stereos are overpriced-- $350 just for a CD player!  I opted for the base casette deck, which was quickly replaced with a nice Kenwood deck for less money.  The speakers are quite good, if not perfect, and when paired with a good stereo should be more than enough for the average person.  (Those of you who want 2 12" subs will find that the trunk has ample room)

There are faster cars and cheaper cars, but Honda yet again outdoes itself with (in my opinion) the best all-around car in it's class.  Excellent handling, acceleration, fuel economy, passenger and cargo room, coupled with Honda's legendary reliability and an affordable price tag will make this car a good automotive investment.
