            It's been almost a year now since I purchased the truck of my dreams. I have not been disappointed, the experience is great and one that I do not get tired of. I needed a vehicle that could provide room for passengers, power to tow, a place to haul things, reliability and great looks. With the 1999 Extended Cab Silverado I got everything I was looking for in my dream car. I purchased the truck based on 10 years of driving my S-10 and never making a repair other than normal maintenance. My truck is the Carmine Red and Silver extended cab with a gray interior. After purchasing I added a cap and boards to match and have been mistaken several times for a Suburban that costs 20k more.
My truck has the 327 Vortec with a 4 speed automatic transmission. This provides power for any need and really performed great last summer in the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is so easy to drive I have trouble getting it from my wife.
If your looking for a very expensive pleasure or sports car this machine may not be for you, but if your in the market for a truck or SUV then check out the Silverado, the 2000 year could only be better with the addition of the forth door.<br><br>
