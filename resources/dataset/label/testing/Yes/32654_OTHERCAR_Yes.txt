            I purchased my 1990 Jeep Cherokee Laredo shortly after I feel in love with my wife's Jeep Cherokee. I had been considering a 1991 Chevy Suburban but soon changed my mind.  That was two years ago.  

My Jeep has 176,000 miles on it but runs like a champ.  I love it. It is wonderful to drive on a daily basis and didn't let me down in the 21&quot; of snow we got last winter. I even took it out on the beach last summer. It performs well on a consistent basis.  

Mechanically this car has been a dream.  I am a mechanic by trade so I didn't mind buying an older vehicle that may have needed work. I have done little to this Jeep except routine maintainence. 

 The only thing I don't like about this Jeep is the paint.  You will find if you look at several different Jeeps in the early 1990's  year range, that the paint is famous for not holding up well. I am getting mine repainted soon but every 90-91 Jeep I looked at when purchasing mine had either been repainted or needed repainting. My wife has a 1987 Jeep and the paint is still perfect on that. However, when Chrysler took over production of the Jeep in the late 80's early 90's, the lead was removed from the paint and that resulted in a poor quality paint job. 

 This is a great vehicle for someone who wants a quality suv without paying new car prices. After all the body style for the Jeep Cherokee is virtually the same from 1987 through 1996.  

Shop around and get one. I love mine. <br><br>
