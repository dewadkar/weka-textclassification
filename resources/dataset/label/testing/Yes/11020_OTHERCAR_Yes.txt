            We really enjoy our 1995 Astro Van.  We have six children that travel in it at one time.  We take it everywhere, from the grocery store to fine dinning events.  We have not had any problems with the van at all.  We live 2 miles from the kids school and we load up the van and take all of them to school with ease of complaining.  We love the room that it has and the extra cargo space in the back with all the kids in the van we can load up on all of the things we need and take them all home.  If you a have a family with 3 children to 6 children you will love this van.  Give it a try &quot;Like A Rock&quot;<br><br>
