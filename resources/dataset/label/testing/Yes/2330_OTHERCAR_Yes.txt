            It finally came time to get a digital camera. The piles of undeveloped film were piling up, and the costs associated with buying film, getting it developed, paying for reprints, piles of &quot;dud&quot; photos, etc., was really starting to get to me. I also have a web site that has a small section where I post craft project directions. With traditional film, many projects were posted without photos to show people to finished results, because of the previously mentioned piles of undeveloped film. I needed a digital camera.

So, we went to CompUSA to have a look. We knew we wanted something with at least 2 megapixels. Since I have a Mac, I needed something USB that did not require a floppy drive. I also did not want to spend more than $500. After looking at all CompUSA had to offer (had to shop there, I needed to put it on my store card), the Toshiba PDR-M4 fit the bill. 

It's got 2.1 megapixels, USB, and takes SmartMedia storage cards. It came with an 8 MB card, but you can get up to 32 MB. The camera offers macro, zoom, and multiple levels of image quality. The LCD screen allows you to take photos without squinting through some teeny little viewfinder, and you can preview and delete your photos with the controls on the back of the camera. It also features a manual setting, where you can adjust the focus and other features of an SLR camera. I have not played with this aspect yet, as I am still trying to get the hang of regular, &quot;idiot camera&quot; use. :~)

At first, as with all new technology, it is a little daunting. I don't normally do this, but I made sure I read the manual this time, and once I used the camera a few times, the procedures became second nature. There are not too many little buttons to worry about, and everything is clearly marked, so once you know what the icon is for, you are set. The status display is a little jumbled, but a quick look at the diagram in the manual helps you get your bearings as far as what all the little icons mean.

If you have a Mac, this is a great model to get. I didn't even have to install the drivers for my G4. I plugged in the USB cable (one end in camera, the other in the left USB port of my keyboard), and the icon popped up on my desktop just like a disk, allowing me to copy the files to my hard drive. When I unplugged it, the icon disappeared. 

My only disappointment is that the camera is only the equivalent of ISO 100 film. I normally use 200 when I buy regular 35mm film, and sometimes 400, so it took some getting used to, as 100 normally requires bright daylight to perform its best. So, indoor shots can come out a little bit dark. They look fine on the LCD preview, but when I opened them on my computer, they were dark, so I had to fiddle with them in Photoshop.

Overall, this camera does an admirable job. The photos are good quality JPEGs, and color is very accurate. Above all, I just love the fact that I never have to buy film again, at least not for my web site, client web sites and small projects, or for the &quot;fun stuff.&quot; When I go on an extended vacation, I will still bring a regular camera, because carrying film around is easier than trying to keep the Smart Media cards safe. Regular camera batteries last longer than the rechargeable in the Toshiba.<br><br>
