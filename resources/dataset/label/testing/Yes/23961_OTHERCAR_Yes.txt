            I must preface this by saying I am a loyal VW follower. I like the ingenuity and European quality and design of VW. So, when our family outgrew the Passat wagon, we went looking for a mini-van...and despite the loyalty I did explore the marketplace before deciding on VW.  What won our family over is the one thing we truly wanted in a vehicle... space. And we got it- 200 cubic feet of it.

There are two models: GLS and MV. The main difference is the seat configuration. GLS has two front driver captain's chairs, followed by a 2-person bench, followed by a 3-person bench (removable). The MV has the same except instead of a 2-person bench it has 2 <b>rear-facing</b> seats (also removable).  MV also includes a fold-up table for use between the 2nd and 3rd seat rows and a shelf in the rear.  The 3rd row bench even converts to a bed! 

We purchased the MV. And here is what I have liked most about it: <b>the unique seat configuration</b>. With the rear-facing seats in the middle, this provides a lot of area to move around; other mini-vans found us still trying to maneuver around seats and without hardly any leg room. I appreciate the spacious area especially when placing children into car seats. I also like being able to walk straight from driver seat through to the passenger area. <b>It is child-friendly</b>. With cup holders, table, lights, tethers for child seats, storage bins, padded shelf in rear cargo area GREAT for diaper changes and still tons of room below shelf for strollers, bags, etc. I can't imagine traveling long distance or running errands without it. With extra d/c outlets in rear, we purchased a cooler for $50 that plugs into the outlet; keeps drinks, formula, food etc.. cold. Like having a mini fridge! <b>Fun to drive</b>. I am 5'1'' and my husband 6'4''. We both drive it comfortably...and having just completed a 12-hour trip twice in the last month I think we can truly assess this!  My husband loves sitting in the 2nd row seats rear-facing..can stretch legs considerably...analogous to the "emergency row" on an aircraft, for which he always requests for the add'l leg room. The feel of the vehicle is different than any other. It rides very high, but with a short hood you do not feel like you are driving a large vehicle. We tested the hauling capacity by completely removing the 2nd and 3rd row seats and shelf to find an impressive space. It held an entire bedroom suite and desk with room to spare. <b>Great Warranty.</b> 4 years, 48,000 miles. <b>It is utilitarian.</b> This vehicle has room for people, room for stuff, easy for my 2 year old and my grandmother alike to step into, works for a short driver and tall driver both. We hauled furniture, we hauled people (children and seniors), we take it on long trips, short trips...Whatever our mission we accomplish it in the EuroVan.

How did the EuroVan drive?
Overall the driveability is good; but being that it is a van..it drives like a van. Not a van that drives like a sedan, or an SUV, etc. We were surprised at the acceleration, it is by no means a "throw your head back" experience, but it does have power when you need it. The turning radius is quite good, considering the size of the vehicle. Eleven inches taller than an Odyssey you definitely have a sense that you are driving a very tall vehicle. If you are wanting something sporty, this is not for you. For our family, we wanted a safe vehicle with lots of space & around $25,000. And that's what we got. The drive is adequate for our purposes, but it was the unique seat configuration that won us over. Gas mileage has hovered around 15-17 mpg. 

Our dislikes.  Of the 7 seats only 4 have 3-point restraint, the rest are lap belts only. Unlike other mini-vans, only 1 door and it is not automatic. (This I don't mind, I figure I burn an extra 6 calories each time I open and close). Rear hatch very long..we actually cannot open it in our garage lest we hit the garage door! Uses premium fuel only. 

What you might dislike, but we didn't particularly need..if you compare this to an Odyssey or Town & Country you might find the interior austere and the exterior boxier than most. You won't find the DVD system, automatic doors, plush captains chairs etc..

The EuroVan is a rarity. We'd never seen one except at the dealership...this is part of the appeal. Since then only about 2 others.  We have rec'd many remarks from others like "congratulations on not buying a cookie cutter minivan!" The 16-year old at the drive-thru window says "EuroVan- Cool!!"  We're as hip as MTV it seems...and that doesn't come easy for 2 thirty-something computer programmers with "2 under 2".  We are very pleased with our purchase..I think this is a special vehicle which we have come to enjoy more each day since our purchase.
