             I purchased my Cutlass in Feb.of 1997 when it had 17,000 miles on it and have never regretted buying it. My car currently has 55,000.

 My car has only been to the shop 2 times since it was purchased and both times the problems happened when my wife was driving so I don't know if it was the car or my wife!

 The first problem occurred when I was out of town and my wife drove the car to her friends house. My wife was about to leave and the car would not start, all of the electrical items in the car would turn on and off but it just would not turn over. The car was towed to the dealership and it was determined that the security system in the steering column had shorted out and had to be replaced and since it happened after the 3 year mark of the warranty in cost me about $275.00

 The second problem occurred when my wife was driving the car and the driver's side window came out of the track. We took the car to the dealership and they said that the plastic track that is bonded to the window had broken and it would cost $800.00 for the window and installation plus it would extra to match the tint with the rest of the car. I called around and Safelite glass had a window for $250.00 installed and it was another $30.00 to have it tinted.

 I really love this car and highly recommend it to anybody. As you can see I have had very little problems and expect very few in the future.

I would consider this car a BEST BUY.
