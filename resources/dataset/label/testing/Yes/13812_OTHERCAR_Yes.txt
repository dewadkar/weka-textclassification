            The perfect luxary car has arrived. And its not a coincedence that the people that invented the car have made this one. The sleekest looking automobile I have ever set eyes is at the same time most original. Beautiful looking in silver as I have bought it. This 2000 car rides like a dream. The 70,000 dollars is well worth it. A standard v-8 on this suedan really powers the car for maximum acceleration. The room in the back of the car just can not be complained about. And the engine is very very quiet. With rear wheel drive although the car does not do well at all in snow or ice. So if you live in New-England I hope this is not your only car. The voice activated system is also great. When dialing a number on the car phone there is no need to press buttons. You simply say the number and then say dial number. And the best part about the electronics in this automobile is the GPS(Global Positioning System). When you need the directions simply typen them into the computer system and the car will tell you where to turn and how to get there and how long it will take. <br><br>
