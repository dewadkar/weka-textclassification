            Having driven Toyota for the past 8 years ( celica, Supra, Camry) I was ready for something new. The solara was advertised as the &quot;aging boomer&quot; sports car. I agree - it's as great on the inside (very quiet and all the bells and whistles) as it is on the outside. The ride is 75% better than the camry. Not quite as good as the supra was, but then the supra could not handle the Colorado snow at all. Front wheel drive helps this car out in the snow. If you are thinking about buying it I recommend you get the top of the line model. - V6 engine, Moon roof, fin on the back (need this to be a sports car), alloy wheels, 8 speakers in the car to listen to all the oldies, automatic temperature control and lights, even comes equipped with an automatic garage door opener that also can be coded to turn on your house lights!<br><br>
