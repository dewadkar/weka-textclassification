            I purchased the car last year, and it was very reliable for driving 30 miles to work every day.  The acceleration is great for getting on interstates and difficult city driving.  The car is very roomy and you feel very safe behind the wheel; there's a lot of metal between you and the road.  The instrument panel is highly visible at night.  The power door locks are an added bonus, as they give each passenger time to get out of the car before locking all the doors.  The headlight system has an automatic photo-sensor that is very useful: you will NEVER have to remember to turn on your headlights again!  The repair record has been good, there are now 48,500 miles on it and I havent had any major problems.  The disadvantage is the visibility due to the poorly designed headrests.  Don't expect to be able to look over your shoulder before chaging lanes. Overall a very nice looking car for not a lot of money.  I definitely recommend the 2000 Pontiac Grand Am.
