            I live in Alabama and with these hills my past cars were breaking down constantly. I got the Jeep used about 2 years ago with quite a lot of miles on it. It has never needed to be taken in for anything. These are great, dependable, and affordable cars. This would be great for carpooling or for a teenager. It has good gas mileage and warnings that tell you when to check the oil and when maintenance is needed. Oil is also very easy to change on your own, it's right up under the car, very easy access. I got this car while i was a still in high school, it's a great car to tote friends around in. Insurance is relatively low as well. One problem would be that  the Jeeps are relatively expensive to repair if they are in a wreck, but all in all a good car.<br><br>
