            I've been a Chevy man all my life. I have several friends that own these diesels and use the fire out of them. So I bought one. Well folks, they are super trucks. One very strong suggestion, don't buy an automatic like I did. I have 13,300 miles on my truck. My torque converted gave up the ghost and distributed itself all through my transmission. It is fixed now, but after doing some research here on the net, the torque converter is the weak link on this high torque truck. There are lots of fixes out there for this, but Dodge ain't going to pay for them. So, that Cummins under the hood is everything everyone said plus some and it is warrented for 100,000 miles. I just wish the tranny was too!

Oh, BTW, those with manual transmission have a few problems too, but not like mine did. My friends all have over 200,000 miles on their trucks and can't wear them out. One did finally did replace his tranny at 312,000 miles.

If you want a 3/4 ton truck that will get 20 mpg on the highway and pull what ever your hearts desire is, this is the truck (with a manual tranny).<br><br>
