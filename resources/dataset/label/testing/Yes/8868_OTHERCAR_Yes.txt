            Buying a couple of used Honda Accords has to have been one of the smartest things I've done.  Call me boring, I don't care, these things last!

The first one I bought in 1997.  It is a 1990 Accord EX 5-spd, power everything, and it had about 120K miles on it.  A sales rep had owned it and took care of it as if it were his first born child.  Two and a half years later, the car has about 150K miles on it, and I haven't done anything other than change the oil!  I'm hoping to drive this car for at least another 50K miles.

The second one was just purchased recently.  It's a 1993 Accord SE, with all of the bells and whistles, including leather seats, airbags, etc.  It has about 90K miles and runs like a dream.  I had it checked out and it passed with flying colors.  

Bottom line, why shell out 25 grand for a new car?<br><br>
