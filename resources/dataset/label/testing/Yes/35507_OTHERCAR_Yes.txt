            I had been looking for a minivan for several years, but the main problem with all of them is the third seat.  If you went on a trip with a group in two cars, but wanted to use your cargo room without the third seat it had to be removed and left at home on all minivans. Once at the vacation spot you still had to use two cars to go out, when if you had the third seat all could ride in the van.  This is where Honda stands out and also that it was a Honda.  When offered the two models, I wanted to get the EX but did not due to the power sliding doors.  As an electrical engineer by trade I had this gut feeling that power sliding doors had not been around long enough to be reliable (on any van not just Honda) unlike power windows that have been around since before I was born.  From the looks of the post in this group and others I was correct.

The other funny thing is that my fathers 1970s Chevy station wagon had a third that folded into the floor.  American car designers must have forgotten about this over the years and now it has come back to haunt them.

On the plus side, we love our van and have not had a single problem yet.  The third seat is great and it drives like a dream. We plan on keeping this one for a long time and purchasing another Honda when it is time for a new van. <br><br>
