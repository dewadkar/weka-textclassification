            If you like a smooth and relaxing ride, if you are looking for a luxury of features, combined with ease of use and comfort at long distances, the Bonneville should be something to look at. I enjoy every minute of driving and realize that I do not get from A to B faster but a lot more relaxed! To prove that all slogans for large, roomy cars are true, there is absolutely no way to reach the co.�s door pocket while being buckled in the driver�s seat. You have to move out of your seat to reach there!

The SSE is extremely comfortable. The seats are big, I mean really BIG, and offer a stay-in-pace-fit automatic for adjusting in 8 directions. The rear bench features a pass-though in the arm rest (along with two cup holders) for ski or any other items that may be longer as the HUGE(!!!) trunk with it�s capacity of 18 cubic feet. Additional cup holders are available in the doors and middle console. Belts are adjustable even for children�s size. The design is especially made to keep the belt away from children�s neck and face. 

The instrument panel is clear, very easy to read (without moving out of the perfect driving position!) and the backlight not too bright (some middle shade between orange and red, pretty warm and you can dim it too). There is a control center in the middle of the panes that tells you the oil and coolant levels or whether the hood or trunk is not completely closed. The overhead lamps are very useful, don�t dazzle and can be used per seat (all four seats). They give a nice light to read a map and have a pretty narrow lightening point. That�s why they do not bother at all while driving.
