                       2k. The start of a new Monte Carlo. A lot of old fans thought the front wheel drive and V6 steered away from the classics. Whenever there's even a drop of rain, my friends and I have always taken the Monte over their Camaros or Firebirds. The Grand National, a beautiful V6 Turbo powered counterpart of the 80's SS, has more in common with the new installment of Montes than the old. Yes. The Buick was faster at the time as well. Everyone has been complaining that the V6 just isn't enough right now. Keep in mind that it is easy to upgrade and holds so much reliability because of those 35 years behind the engine. The engine's 200 horses is more than enough to combat even the old 305 V8's, of which many of my friends have. As a kid basically I need enough power in my 0-60 too destroy many different types of automobile. I'm very pleased with it. 200 horses has become a standard for coupes, at least American made, so even a few hundred in practical mods (i.e. exhaust, cold air intake) puts you well ahead of the competition. The luxury part of the car isn't really that important to me, but driving the SS in suit does have an impression that I'm more important than that guy in the Lumina at the Dairy Queen. I never have to take my eyes off of the road to change CD tracks either because the controls are placed on the steering wheel. I also don't think you're going to find more room in a coupe. I rarely carry anything that big with me, so I don't need it, but it is nice to know that it's there. As a teenager, I also beat on my car all the time. I'm proud to say I have already broken a previous car. I'm also proud to say that I have met my match because the SS really doesn't quit no matter how hard I push it.
