            We currently own two S-10 Blazers, a <b>1984 2 door</b> and a <b>1995 LS</b> model, both are very reliable, fun and smooth to drive, excellent towing and a great all around deal.  Both are 4x4

For a review of the 1995 visit http://blazer_bob.epinions.com/auto-review-3561-3B9F6D6-38E59336-prod6

<b>1984 S-10 Two Door Pro's</b>
This S-10 Blazer is also 4x4, you can�t live without it in Northern Arizona.  The 4x4 takes a while to engage, like six seconds, but it is very effective once it is in.  This Blazer will climb anything that its wheels will grasp.

The roominess is excellent in the Blazer too, seating five people of average or less composition comfortably, and with the seat down there is lots of room for payload, camping or whatever.

The 2.8 liter V6 leaves a little to be desired, with a 0-60 time of 22 seconds.  It will still tow 5,000 lbs(not always at the speed limit on hills).  One nice point with the 2.8 liter engine is that it gets an average of 25 mpg on 92 octane fuel on the highway.  This was the largest engine offered in 1984.

1984-1989 S-10 Blazers have amazing stock stickers, they look like paint and are very detailed.

The dual-off tone horns really make an annoying loud sound.  The best I have heard that do not rely on compressed air.

The steering column does not require a key, which is very nice and saves time.  If need be, you can lock the steering column and ignition.

It has a spoiler which keeps the rear window clean, which is nice.  It sports a luggage rack, which is more for looks than carrying capacity, unless it�s a family of more than four, I can�t see needing it.

The drive-train on this vehicle has over 300,000 miles on it.  The engine required a rebuild at 147,000 miles due to not enough oil, but was less than $2,000 installed.  The rebuilt engine now has 154,000 miles on it and is running strong.

<b>Cons for the 1984</b>
Again, the sound system, in a word, �Sucks�, and I had to replace it I disliked it so much.

S-10�s in the mid 1980�s had frequent power steering failures, but weighing only 3,200 lbs, it is still manageable.  For a feeling of what no power steering feels like, find a very unpopulated place and get your car up to about fifteen mph.  Shut it off(Not to &quot;lock&quot;, just so the engine dies).  From here do some maneuvers, you'll realize it really isn't that bad, sometimes it gets a little cumbersome in traffic, but I usually don't complain.  Be prepared to turn your car back on because shutting off the engine will also kill your brakes after you pump them a bit.

General Motors has not been fortunate with paint, it is chipping badly, but function over beauty has helped us overlook this minor problem.  <b>Update 5/19</b>  I recently repainted it myself.  I estimated about $1,500 for the quality paint job I put on it.  The paint job that was on it was nice enough that it could have lasted until I was done with it.  But I couldn't give it back to my parents with all of the fresh dents.

The bowtie in 1984 was hardly up to par, I fabricated one out of body filler, and that fixed that.

The automatic hubs went out, but it was a quick fix with a suction hose bypassing Chevy�s hose.  It also has noisy lifters, more-so since we had the engine rebuilt, but they aren�t affecting anything but making a bit of noise.

The spare tire rattles, but it is a few sizes too big than what came with it.  The running board also rattles, but it did not until a rather large log dented it.

The four speed leaves top speed just shy of 85 mph, not so good on the freeways of Arizona.  At 85 mph, constant, the mileage goes down to 15, so I don�t usually go that fast.

The lack of a roll bar is a minor issue, although it does seem to hug the road well, despite its look of being top heavy.

<b>Overall</b>
With Chevrolet's motto, &quot;A little security in an insecure world.&quot; I believe that times two, we have a lot of security, I would definitely recommend these to my friends. My family has had no regrets.<br><br>
