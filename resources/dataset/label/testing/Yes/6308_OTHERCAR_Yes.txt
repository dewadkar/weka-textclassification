1. on the federal crash test it got five stars thats the highest ranking they give.

2. it has great gas milege for a car of it's size

3. the radio has awsome sound (well the sound better be awsome because their BOSE speakers)it has 6 speakers all together mounted on the doors as well in the back.

4. the price...... NEED I SAY MORE

5. the engine has great torque and speed.

6. The looks are classy but also sporty.
