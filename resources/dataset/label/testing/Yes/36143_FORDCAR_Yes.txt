            Three months ago, after a month of internet research, I went down to my local Ford dealership and test drove, then purchased my Autumn orange Focus ZX3. What caught my eye at first was the style of the car.  Unique.  Make no mistake, these cars are attention getters! Not a week goes by that someone does not ask me about the car!  Well, after having driven the vehicle, I must say that it lives up to all that I read about it.  A solid feel, Lots of interior room for the big man (I'm 6'3) and the Z-tech engine provides 130hp of easy freeway acceleration.  Built in goodies include 15&quot; wheels for great handling, no spark plug replacement for 100,000 miles, a dome light that stays on for one minute after you enter the vehicle and shut the doors, a beautifully designed instrument panel, folding rear seats, a descent sounding sound system, fog lights, extra-adjustable front seat, and many other little things that Ford added to the car to make it special.  Well, my wife drove it once.  Needless to say, we now have two Focuses in our garage!  In my opinion, if you are looking for a solid transportation vehicle that is very reasonably priced, you will not find a better offering than the Focus ZX3.  
P.S.  Did I mention that Ford sent me a watch?  How cool is that?
