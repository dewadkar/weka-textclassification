            We had a 1996 Ford Windstar minivan but after the birth of our third child it began to feel too small. (Our stroller took up the entire cargo area.)  Our van also had no headrests and were advised that our 9 year old son could sustain neck injuries because his head was above the back of the seat.  

We began looking for a nice used van.  We located a 1998 Chevy Venture LS Ext. van on the internet and made arrangements to see it.  We fell in love with it at first site.  Instead of two bench seats, it had five individual bucket seats.  Each seat can be removed independently of each other, but what is better is that you don't even have to remove them to get the extra space.  You can just &quot;flip and fold&quot; one or more of them.  Which means you don't lose 3 seats just because you have extra cargo.  I can just &quot;flip and fold&quot; one of the back seats to make room for groceries and still seat 4 children!  

You can also recline any or all of the seats independently without disturbing the others.  Each seat also may be slid backward or forward by itself!  The possibilities are endless!!  We also now have rear air conditioning which comes in handy here in New Orleans where temperatures during the summer frequently reach 104 degrees.  We did not get rear headphone jacks (which we had in our other van), but I would highly recommend them.  Overall it is an excellent family van.<br><br>
