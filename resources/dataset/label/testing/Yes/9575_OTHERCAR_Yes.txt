             Don't mind the title. We're here to talk about a car.  The new 2000 Toyota Celica is a fabulous car.  The new body is spectacular and the price is unheard of these days.  However, this car does have a large flaw...that is that the engine is not nearly as good as the earlier edition Celicas. In 1987, I bought a brand new Celica and it was indestructable.  The engine was awesome and at that time, without equal in that price range.  Although the new Celica's engine is not bad, it is not nearly as good or as strong as the older car's.  This car is comparable to the new Mitsubishi Eclipses, but with a Toyota, you know you will get much better quality.  This car is highly recommended to any kind of driver.  It is the ideal car for a first time driver and its price range is (like I said) superior.  Though the acceleration is not as good as the more powerful cars, this car is awesome.     <br><br>
