            After recieving this camera for Christmas I have yet to have a problem with it. My experience so far has been flawless. 

The menus are simple and very easy to navigate through. Although the 'Ok' button is a little tough to get my fat fingers to press but it's managable. 

It has a USB port which is extremely easy to move images to my computer with. As well as a video out port with a cable included for easy viewing on pretty much any television set. This is a super feature!

Plug the video out cable into the camera and television and everything you see on the LCD screen you see on the TV. It is perfect for viewing pics on a vacation, away from home, etc. If you need to see small details on the picture no problem. Just zoom in on the LCD screen or for a bigger picture on the TV with the video cable connected. 

Super amazing quality. 2.0 megapixels is more then enough for me. A regular sized photo will print crystal clear even on the lowest resolution setting.

A regular view finder is perfect for those darker shots that you can't make out on the LCD screen. The Autofocus indicator is an excellent feature that allows the camera to focus itself in low light prior to the picture being taken with the flash. 

Memory sticks are expensive and this one only comes with a 8 Meg stick. I purchased a 64 Meg memory stick through an online offer through sonystyle.ca (Register your cam online and get $20 credit at the online store). I'm sure 64 Megs will be enough, at least I hope.

With the 64 Meg card you can take the following number of pictures (on fine quality):

393 -  640 x 480
103 - 1280 x 960
66  - 1600 x 1200

Even at the highest resolution this is more then enough for one sitting.

Overall great camera for the price paid. Perfect for an amateur photographer. I love it!
