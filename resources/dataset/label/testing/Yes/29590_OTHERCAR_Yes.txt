            We bought the new 2000 Quest Sport March of 2000. So far we love it.  This is our first mini van. We previously have only owned SUV's. The ride is great, it drives like a car.  Of course the kids love the TV/VCR, we love the headphone capabilities. Looking forward to vacation in the van. I'm alittle concerned about the amount of room we'll have for luggage in the rear. We removed one of the captain chairs &amp; bought a mat at home depot to save the wear on the carpet.  This makes it easier to get in &amp; out of the back. Brakes feel great! I'm petite &amp; was concern over the seat adjustment &amp; visibility but, adjustment on seat great as well as visibility. Can see well around &amp; out back. It's also really quiet. So far we love it!<br><br>
