            It was time to get a new car, and I wanted something that was sporty but still had that luxury feel.  This car had all the features I was looking for.  From leather seats to a spoiler.  The driver and passenger seats had all the different settings to make your ride comfortable.  There are features that are standard on this vehicle which would be optional on others, such as: heads up display, heated mirrors, fog lights, CD player with tape deck, and a trunk that can handle skis. The car handled curves tight and the ride was smooth as glass. 
I looked at other cars but when I saw and drove this car it met all my requirements. No matter what your age, you will enjoy owning this car.  <br><br>
