            We traded in our 1995 Dodge Grand Caravan for a Chrysler Town and Country LX equipped with the 25K package in preparation for a driving vacation.  Another Dodge Grand Caravan we looked at was practically identical and the only reason we chose the Town and Country was because of the great deal we were able to get.  

We recently returned from the driving trip, where the new minivan was officially broken in and put through its paces.  The first thing we noticed when we were packing it up was, although the minivan is slightly longer than our old Grand Caravan, the extra space (and more) was devoted entirely to passenger space.  This is a great thing 11.5 months out of the year.  However, there was a noticeable decrease in storage space in the back and under the seats.  It wasn't a problem because we had bought a luggage carrier for the trip but if we didn't have the carrier, we would have been truly strapped for space.  Bottom line:  get the luggage rack if you travel.

From a comfort perspective, whether driving or just being a passenger, I can't imagine anything beating this vehicle.  If you and your family spend a lot of time in your car, I highly recommend this minivan.  We have captains chairs in the middle, which in addition to being really nice looking, are incredibly comfortable upright or reclined.  Even the third seat reclines, which was nice.

I also recommend springing for the passenger-control air/heating option.  We were many hours driving through the south, where it was hot and humid so we had to have the air on.  Everyone was able to adjust the temp and breeze to their satisfaction, normally a big sticking point when all the air is only blowing on the front passengers.

We also drove through the Smoky Mountains.  Let's just say we weren't going to win any races uphill versus traditional cars - the minivan definitely labored going up the inclines.  I suppose that's to be expected.  

Overall, with the luggage carrier, the air on, and mountain driving, we averaged about 17 MPG.  When the air was off and we hit straight roads, that improved tremendously - well over 20 MPG.

The drawer under the front passenger seat has broken already but so did the one in our Grand Caravan - there's obviously something amiss there.

Handling (eg. turning, U-turns, parking etc.) - huge positive difference vs. the old Grand Caravan even though this minivan is longer.  It handles extremely well and maneuvers nicely.

Access to the third seat is very easy without moving any seats for younger people (they just walk through the middle of the captain's chairs).  However, if you need to move one of the chairs to allow access to the back, it is quick, smooth, and lightweight.  My 7-year old does it regularly for my mom (but watch your toes in the back).

It is very attractive on the outside - we went with Patriot Blue and have received a number of compliments on the color.  The inside is dark blue, and looks great when it's clean (key:  when it's clean - the dark blue shows all dusk, lint etc. but hides actual dirt).

Overall, I would highly recommend this minivan to anyone in the minivan market who values passenger space and comfort.
