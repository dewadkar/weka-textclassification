            The Hyundai Accent is an excellent car for any new family.  With the high price of cars the Accent is a great place to start.  From the inside the Accent looks clean and sharp.  The controls are easy see as well as to use.  The basic features include,AM/FM cassette sound system, rear window defroster, variable intermittent windshield wipers, and fold-away heated outside mirrors.  With the base price being $9699 the Accent is an affordable car.  Although, it doesn't have much for performance I think it focuses more on ergonomics, safety features, and of course VALUE.  The warranty on this car is pretty good with five years/60,000 miles bumber to bumper and 10 year/100,000 miles for powertrain, and 24 hour roadside assistance for five years.  Overall a good deal.<br><br>
