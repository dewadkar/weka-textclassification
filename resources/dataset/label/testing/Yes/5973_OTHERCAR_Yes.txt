            hello all, this is something you should all do, if u like a little more noise for your dels sol's i have a 95 vtec with a cherry bomb, its very sweet when u race another car and shes screamin out with sweet and ripe noise when you reach around 5,000 rpm she real loud and get about 6,500 and 7,000 she screams, its a sweet sound, even more so when you blow by a mustang or camaro .i recomend this its cheap i believe it cost me 57$ total apposed to about 350$ for a muffler that does nothing more than the simple cherry bomb, except empty your pocket....so try a cherry bomb youll love it :)<br><br>
