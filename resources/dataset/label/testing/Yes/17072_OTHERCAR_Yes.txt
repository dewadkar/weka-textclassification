            I have owned an Audi A-6 since October 1997. The car is a dream. Although I have only a 4 cylinder Turbo 1.8 liter T engine the performance is equal to a much higher horse power. I drive in Europe at cruise speeds of 125 MPH to 130MPH and have had the car up to 250 KMH (150+ MPH) on a down hill scenario. Stable, quiet, comfortable, ... nothing missing. There have been a few teething problems with the heated mirrors, the turbo, a lot of tire wear at higher speeds, especially in winter. There is no speed limit on most of the German super highways so I have gone quite fast. I tried out the A-8 with an 8 cylinder 4,8 liter engine and it was much faster(more than 180MPH, 300 KMH) but only for short sprints. The traffic just wouldn't allow it. If given the choice and money again today, I would buy a new A-6 with a 2,8 liter engine and quattro traction. The Audi is supported in Europe without a problem and the company has really worked to keep my confidence. I suggest that anyone with a budget of $35,000 to $40,000 should certainly evaluate this vehicle. If the money doesn't make it then the safety and comfort certainly does.<br><br>
