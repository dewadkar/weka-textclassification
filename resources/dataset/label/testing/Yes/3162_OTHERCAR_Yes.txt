            Being a person who enjoys cars, old classics and new alike, I decided a few years ago that I needed to start saving my pennies so that some day I could enjoy a fast machine from the inside as well as the outside.
As anyone who attends a classic car show knows, just looking at those gorgeous pieces of engineering marvels, gets you wishing you had you own.
Well that penny pinching finally paid off a few months ago when I was able to purchase my dream car, a Camaro.
I got a '95 Camaro RS, it has the T top which will be a blast on those summer days and warm summer nights.  Imagine yourself grabbing gears in the twilight with the wind whistling through your hair.  That's what I'm anxious to do as soon as the weather changes from grays to rays.
I have been very impressed with the handling of this vehicle.  Not only does it look sharp, but the smooth handling, even at higher speeds makes you feel like your barely moving.
The cornering capabilities of this car are excellent.  This is the first car I've driven that grips the road so well, that it seems that you don't even need to decelerate to make it through.  That is, of course, unless you enter that corner way too fast in the first place.
One of the reasons that made me decide on the Camaro is that being a man with a family, who enjoys sports cars, it was the very best option.  There is enough room for me, my wife, and our three year old daughter.
My daughter is rapidly shedding the influence of her grandfather who has corrupted her impressionable mind into thinking &quot;Mopar or no car.&quot;
It does my heart good, to hear her speak so highly of a Chevy in his presence.  And the best part is that after letting this Mopar nut drive my car, even <i> he </i> was impressed.
Another option that the Camaro has that seems to be overlooked by some vehicle makers, is the safety features that this car has to offer its passengers.  With its dual airbags and the distance the car's front end provides, you feel as safe as a dollar bill in Fort Knox.
All in all, I have enjoyed my new car and encourage anyone who likes sporty cars that has a family to see if this is the car for them.<br><br>
