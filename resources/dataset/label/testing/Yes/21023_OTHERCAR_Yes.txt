            I have waited quite awhile to join in the digitial picture revolution.  Once the DSC-P5 camera was available at a reasonable price, I jumped right in.

The Sony is extremely small for a digital camera and makes carrying it in your pocket easy as can be.  The picture quality at the highest resolution is fantastic especially in bright light.  I took a high resolution picture of the 18th at Pebble beach, had it printed by one of the on-line photo printing companies and friends cannot tell it is a digital picture.

The only drawback to the picture quality is that that sometimes the autofocus has trouble in low light situations and you end up with slightly blurry pictures (that on the LCD display don't really show as blurry).  Also, in low light situations, unless you can use the low light mode with a tripod, the pictures are often quite dark. (However, the low light mode allows you to take nightime pictures by using a slower shutter speed).  If you use the flash and the subject is close - the pictures are brilliant.  However, if your subject is 15 feet away - many times the flash doesn't help and without it, the picture is too dark to be acceptable.

The main selling points for me to the camera were:

*Small size (no bigger than a cell phone really)
*Included USB port and cable that is very fast and simple to use
*Included Lithium rechargeable battery and charger - no need to purchase regular bateries
*Memory stick for high capacity storage
*LCD to use for aliging pictures
*Easy menu system to review/delete pictures and change options

Drawbacks:
*Comes with 8MB card. This is useless.  At highest resolution, it holds 4 pictures.  Buy a 64 or 128MB card (41 or 82 pictures respectively).
*On/off control is somewhat difficult (too small and not easy with big fingers)


When comparing to other cameras with similar features, this was well positioned pricewise because of the included cables and rechargeable battery.  The only add-on required with the Sony is the larger memory card.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to ditch the 35mm camera and join the digitial revolution.  By sending the files from the Sony DSC-P5 to an on line site and having them printed on professional paper - the quality is as good as the 35MM and suitable for photo albums.  All the while, the digital camera aspect allows you to take all the pictures you want and throw out the bad ones without the cost of film/developing.  I have owned this camera for 6 months and taken over 1000 photos.  We no longer user our 35MM for any pictures because of the quality pictures we get from our Sony.
