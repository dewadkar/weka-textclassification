            Ever since I can remember, my dad has had a GMC 2500.  After getting my license this year, I had the option of driving his 1996 2500 extended cab 2x4 and his year 2000 3500 4 door 4x4.  I love both of them, but the 3500 is a great car.  We got this car because we needed a SUV with pick up truck features.  The 4 door pick up has the same amount of passenger seating as the GMC Yukon or Chevy Tahoe and has the 8 foot bed needed for my dads construction company.  Just recently I took the truck up to New Hampshire while it was snowing and the 4 wheel drive in combination with 4 wheel anti lock brakes made driving no trouble at all. The truck has all the options of a luxury sport utility such as cd play, leather bucket seats, and a great speaker system.
