            Is a 5MP, $299 Camera better than a 2MP or 4MP camera? Easy choice ... right?

Think again.

Remember when Kodachrome film resolution was the standard cameras (it still surpasses digital camera resolution and image quality at any consumer price)? Did this make all 35 mm cameras equal in value and performance?

The Lumix FZ1 simply renders (image color, quality) better at 2MP than that $299 5MP bargain camera. Images look better, with fewer "digital" characteristics. And the simplicity and utility of the design allows for "point and shoot" ease-of-use, and also the right features when an experienced photographer has a specific goal in mind (portrait, macro, sports, or other specific artistic context). Then consider the optics, best in class, from a practical standpoint. A 12X optical zoom range means nearly never having to suffer with those 5x7 prints of a dime sized subject surrounded by empty space. The "anti-shake" DSP compensates for the long zoom and an unsteady hand. And you don't need extra megapixels just because the optics of the camera can't reach the subject!

It's the little things that Panasonic thought of that add up to a big difference in long term satisfaction with this camera, like the rechargeable battery vs. having to have a stockpile of standard disposable batteries.

The balance of speed, handling, and ergonomics, features, and price make this camera possibly the best digital camera product design so far in the limited history of digital photography.

This camera is suitable for a first time user, and advanced photographers. Quite a remarkable accomplishment, and a bit unexpected from Panasonic! This kind of quality and design would be expected from Nikon, Olympus, Minolta, Canon, or another more established and traditional camera manufacturer, but was delivered first by Panasonic.

Sure, if you want 11x14 enlargements, or if you have the extra cash, go for the 4MP Lumix FZ, but remember this:

No current digital camera (consumer grade) has the same resolution that you can get from a $200 35mm camera with good optics.

So if you want the benefits of digital photography (e-mail, sharing images, avoiding the film development cost and time, crop and print your photos from a PC, make photo CD's, etc.), there isn't a better camera on the market.

If you are a perfectionist and must have the best image quality, and are willing to develop film, stick with the lower-cost higher quality film cameras, 35mm format and larger. Pros and artists still find utility in these workhorses, and you may also.

The balance of  features and performance places this camera in a select class of quality digital cameras for  "point-and-shoot" utility and for advanced use. I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone who wants to get into digital photography, at a beginner or advanced level.
