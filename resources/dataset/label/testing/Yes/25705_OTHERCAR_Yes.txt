            I had this Pathfinder for six years and I loved it ever since. After 105,000 miles, the SE 4x4 Pathfinder has given me a lot of reasons to "Enjoy the Ride" as Nissan says in its earlier advertisements. The reliability of this SUV is awesome. No major problems. I had two in-warranty repairs on the throttle and the windows, but that was when the SUV was only 6,000 miles old. After that...nothing. No problem. 

Probably the only thing that I had to get fixed was the somewhat leaking exhaust manifolds, but as of now they are not giving me any major problems and I intend to get them fixed when I have the money. But that's about the only thing that's wrong with the Pathfinder, maintenance wise.

The ride is great, especially with the adjustable shocks. (Except for back seat ride comfort). The limited-slip differential and the four-wheel drive mechanism work superbly when I drive it in icy conditions. The automatic shifts smoothly and gives me enough power when I need it...unless you try driving it up on an incline at freeway speed.

I cannot say the same thing for the engine. It's weak for its time. Fuel economy is not as great. And the safety options...well, no air bags. If you are looking for a used SUV in this model year (1995), the Pathfinder should be your top choice. It was $30K when the Pathfinder was brand-new. It's money well spent. If you have the money, go late model and check out the latter versions, especially the 2001 Pathfinder which has much more horsepower (but no adjustable shocks).
