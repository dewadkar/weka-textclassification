            The Plymouth Voyager/Dodge Caravan is the most user friendly van that you can own.  The seven passenger seating is very comfortable with plenty of leg room.  We have 7 family members with two of them over six feet tall.  They have ample leg room even in the back seat.  The ride is smooth and comfortable for long trips.  There is also quite a bit of storage space in the van.  The hatch in the back even has places for you to hook your plastic grocery bags onto so that your groceries stay in one place when you travel.  The front and rear ac/heat is great because the people in the back can control the rear air for their comfort.  The roof console has a great feature, the temperature and direction are always present on the display.  You can also determine your gas mileage and miles until you need to gas up again.  The van is very easy to handle in any weather or terrain.  We live on a dirt road and it is either very dry and bumpy or very muddy.  We have always had a great ride in this van.  I have owned other brands but always come back to Dodge, and now I wouldn't own anything else.  The only drawback that I see is there is no television built in yet, but I'm expecting this to be in future vans.<br><br>
