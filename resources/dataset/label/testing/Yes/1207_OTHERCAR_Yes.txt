            Bought my 900EMS new in 1980. Retired it recently to occasional use status after 21 years when it was mashed a bit in a accident (the first serious damage after many accidents where it was hit only on the bumpers). Still mechanically sound, runs perfectly, hasn't ever cost me much for repairs (one clutch worn out, one water pump seal worn out, one clutch master cylinder seal broke, one interior heating valve leak). Of course it has accumulated a list of minor ailments over 21 years which I just ignore. The main problem in the last 10 years has been just keeping up with rust on the body and the wear-and-tear on the interior trim, neither of which were designed for the same lifespan as the mechanical components.

This car drives like a sports car, but has the utility of station wagon. Of course it has looks that only a mother could love, but it grows on you. :-)

The fact that my 1980 vintage 900 didn't have much in the way of extra equipment probably helped it live this long with so few problems (no turbo, no automatic transmission, no catalytic converter, no power anything ...)
