            Great, refined sports coupe. The 1st-generation were actually more reliable than the 2nd-generation, but this was corrected for the '96-97 years. However, the early 2nd-gen '93-94s will no doubt have had the bad parts (rear brake calipers, ignition module) replaced by now, so they might be good buys as well.

I bought my alpine-green '97 GT new in 1997 and have been very happy with it. Even though I knew the car was being discontinued, it was still my first choice as there were few cars on the market then that had the Probe's combination of looks, performance, and reliability. Other cars in the segment included the Honda Prelude (even more reliable but very bland), the Eagle Talon (faster, but unreliable and not as nice handling), and the Toyota Celica (not very fast).

The Probe had a class-leading (for the time) 225/50R16 tire/aluminum wheel combo, a smooth V6, and timeless styling. Even 11 years after its introduction, it still turns heads.

The interior is laid out very well, with most controls within easy reach. Some of the plastic bits on the dash feel a little cheap, but I am still impressed with the seats, and with the standard power lumbar control, backaches are a thing of the past. The rear cargo area is huge, but there is a tall liftover height.

I'm a bit of an audiophile, and consider the stock 'Premium Sound' system to be a joke. The speakers are terrible, and just replacing these with medium-quality aftermarket ones made a world of difference. I also replaced the stock head unit with an Alpine 9811, and noticed another jump in sound quality after bypassing the stock amp. As a bonus, the Alpine's styling matches the Probe dash perfectly.

Gas mileage has been decent, and the engine continues to run like new (I only use Mobile-1 5W-30 synthetic, and change it every 5000 Km). The only negative thing I can say about the engine (made by Mazda) is that after a while the cam cover gaskets start to slowly leak oil into the spark plug wells. When this happens you have two choices - every six months try and snake a paper towel down the wells to soak up the excess oil, or get the gaskets replaced (labour is expensive for the V6). If you don't get the oil out it will eventually degrade the plug wires, leading to misfiring.

I've had a few maintenance issues, but that is to be expected given the car's age and mileage (140,000 Km): front wheel bearings, tie rod/endlink, muffler, air conditioning, and cracks in the rubber CV boots. Mustang/Camaro owners report more problems than that, so I'm not complaining.

Ford techs seem to work on Probes very rarely. For routine maintenance my original Ford dealer has been good, but for major work like a timing belt change I go to the local Mazda dealer, since they know these engines intimately.

With the 2.5 L engine and 5-speed, it has great passing power on the highway, but since newer cars (even family sedans) are coming with 200+hp V6s it is no longer a given that you'll beat that new Accord or Altima from the stop light.

I upgraded the rear sway bar, which makes a noticeable improvement in an already good handling car, and replaced the struts with Tokico HP struts (Blues), and matching springs. The result is an improved ride over stock, but the lowered suspension can bottom in the front if you hit a pothole at speed.

Because it is a hatchback, the Probe suffers from 'flex' on rough roads. Installing a rear strut tower bar is a great cure for some of those rattles and squeaks, and makes the car an even better handler. The bar sits high enough so that it doesn't interfere with most cargo (I can still fit my mountain bike under it), but you need to drill holes in your plastic side panels to accommodate the bar.

Another worthwhile upgrade is the addition of phenolic spacers that insulate the intake manifold from the hot cylinder head. The stock Probe's intake manifold gets very hot after a few minutes of driving (especially in Summer) and as a result the power and response can drop off. The spacers largely cure this problem, but they can be tricky to install. However, like the strut tower bar, they are inexpensive and once its done you get the benefit forever.

It's surprising that Ford didn't give the car much of a mid-life update in '95 or '96 - had they upped the horsepower it would surely have stopped the sales slide and maybe the car would still be in production in some form today. As it was, they left it basically unchanged for six years while turning all their attention to the Mustang. Even so, it holds up very well in all categories which is a testament to the original design. The '99-'02 Cougar was the Probe's 'replacement,' but it was slower and not as reliable.

Overall, the car has been good to me (I still get a kick out of driving it), and it gets a lot of compliments. I'll likely keep it for another six years - it only gets more unique on the road with every passing year.
