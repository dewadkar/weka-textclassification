            Back in 1997 I had bought my Isuzu Rodeo new.  It drove nice, and I really loved the power.  Now it's six years later and I still enjoy the way it drives.  It now has some minor noises coming from the back.  I'm not sure to where it comes from, but my feeling is that it's the spare tire holder.  The 4x4 seems not to engage at the time I need it to.  I had engaged it and drove more than 1 mile before it kicked in.  I also noticed back in 1997 that the front defogger only defogged the driver side of the windshield and not the passenger side.  I had taken it to Isuzu, they kepted a day and soon after it started doing it again.  That's it nothing else bad to say about this truck,  now for the good stuff.  I really love the room it has, the stereo is also good, I added an after market CD player and it just added to it.  The paint has held up great and no fading has occured however, I have noticed that the black trim aroung the back window has started to fade, but not much.  It still handles well both on and off road, on road cornering seems fine, considering it is a 4x4.  Other then that ladies and gentlemen I have to say "Not A Bad 4x4"
