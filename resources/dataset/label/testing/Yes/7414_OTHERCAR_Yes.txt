            I had been longing for a tiny digital camera for a while, and since I've chosen the Casio Exilim Z3 I haven't been disappointed.

I've been using the camera for several months now, and have taken at least 100 photos.  At first I was skeptical if such a tiny lens could deliver good photo quality, so I took the same shots with the Casio and my Canon Powershot A40.  Wow.  Quite a difference.  First of all, the Canon was only 2.1 megapixels, and the Casio has around 3.2 so that accounts for some difference.  Surprisingly (to me), I noticed the biggest difference in the depth of color richness rather than in actual details themselves.  I immediately felt comfortable enough to hand over the Canon to my husband, who is a much more casual photographer than I am, and rely completely on the Casio.

If you use the manual white light balance settings, I've found the colors and contrast are generally pretty good right off the camera.  I base this on the fact that I run all the photos I will print through Photoshop for "tweaking", and when I use the "auto levels" and "auto contrast" function in that program, the photos usually don't change much from their original form (as opposed to my Canon camera, where things changed drastically from their original form).  Using the manual settings is fairly easy to do; if you are shooting under incandescent lights, select for that and it automatically gets rid of the yellow cast, and if you are shooting under sunlight, change the setting to sunlight, etc.  The camera remembers certain settings, so you don't have to go through the manual process for each photo.  You can also adjust the shutter speed and EV shift.

The "best scene" settings are interesting, but I haven't really used them much.  They automatically adjust shutter speed, sensitivity, and color balance for whatever type of photo you're taking (portrait, scenery, food, party, candlelight, etc.).  I can't really review their effectiveness since I generally set things manually, but the settings seem reasonable for the general subjects.

The camera is very easy to carry around, which is important since you'll miss the most good shots by simply not having a camera handy.  There's no excuse for not carrying this in one of your pockets (if you're going to carry it near things like keys or coins do yourself a favor and buy a little protective pouch for it to protect its LCD screen).  It's ready to take a picture very quickly after you power it on (unlike many other digital cameras), and I've found that to be really useful.  I haven't had any problems with the small buttons, but if you have large hands or are a little clumsy with small buttons you might want to try this out in a store--it might be *too* small for you!

I'm disappointed that there's no way to charge the batteries other than in the camera (of if there is some after-market solution, it's not well-advertised).  I bought a large memory card and an extra battery right away which are added expenses to an already expensive camera, but if you want to take pictures for an entire vacation without lugging a computer along to download the photos intermittently, you'll really need these things.

In summary, I really think this is a very fine choice if you want a very small camera.  If you don't care about the size (if you take photos at home or situations where you don't have to carry the camera around all day) you could certainly economize by getting an equally good quality camera that is larger than the Exilim for less money.
