            This truck is the absolute best that I have ever owned.  It is an excellent, do anything truck.  The power in it is amazing for being a 3.4 liter V6.  It off-roads like an animal as well.  I bought the truck to go to the snow for boarding trips and to haul my dirt bike, and it does both admirably.  I can put three full sized bikes in the rear and still move on the freeway and around town.  Mountain trips are even easier.  The only qualms that I have about the truck is the front ends ability to dive into corners.  The springs that Toyota put in to the truck just aren't adequate for aggressive driving.  Fortunately, you can get Rancho springs for a very low price and they eliminate any previous problems.  If you are looking for a fast and agile pickup that drives like a champ on or off-road, then the Tacoma is for you.  <br><br>
