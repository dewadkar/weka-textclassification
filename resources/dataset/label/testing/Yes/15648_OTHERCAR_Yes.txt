            What impresses me most about this camera is how fully engineered it is. It has so many features, options and controllable settings that it could have become a nightmare. It is a tribute to Sony engineering that the parts do in fact work together easily and well. I also appreciate the fact that the storage and transfer medium is an ordinary diskette. All in all its a wonderful product. It is by no means cheap but I am sure it will hold value for many years. I originally started looking at it because of its capacity to take 5 sec. chunks of mpeg video. Together with a good mpeg editor, this allows kids to learn simple animation techniques with no cost for media at all. I suppose one could also take longer segments of live action (up to 60 second scenes) and make a movie. Since there is no &quot;costs&quot; associated with failed ideas, this is an ideal teaching tool as well.<br><br>
