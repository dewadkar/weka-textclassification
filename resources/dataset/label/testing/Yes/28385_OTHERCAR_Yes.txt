            In 1993, my family purchased 2 vehicles... the Geo Metro (which I also reviewed) and the 1993 Beretta.

The three colors I remember were bright red, white, and the dark red that we purchased. The vehicle has lots of headroom and legroom, a good sound system (for that year) and a roomy trunk. 

The interior was fairly plain, and the only features for the driver (that I personally noticed) that were out of the ordinary were light and windshield washer controls on either side of the steering wheel on the dashboard. These are similar to the pitch-blend dials on some synth keyboards.

The vehicle we bought was pretty much the base model, but did have air conditioning, power steering, manual transmission, and abs (anti-lock) brakes.

The car is VERY VERY solid, as my father continues to prove. He's been been backed into twice: once from the front, a truck pushed it's trailer hitch full force into his hood, and once from the passenger side when a car backed into the highway just as he passed. In both cases, the sheathing buckled but not the frame. Additionally, he was sideswiped on the drivers side which only caused slight damage to the fender, and rear-ended at a stop light which only scuffed the back bumper.

Initially (within the first year of ownership) the rotors (brakes) were bad, and were turned 3 times before the dealer finally replaced them. Chevy later admitted a problem.

Later, in 1997 or 1998, the car's engine block cracked. Keep in mind though, that this was after 250,000 miles. It spent 2 weeks in the shop, and cost between $800 - 1000 to be replaced.

All in all, it is a fine vehicle, and still being driven by my family, now with 290,000 miles, and not a spot of rust.
