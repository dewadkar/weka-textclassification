            My husband leased a new, 1999 Suburban when he started having to tote around his prototype speakers and all the other audio gear you need to listen to the speakers.  He looked at several other vans, trucks, and SUV -- but decided on the Suburban because it had the most interior room and it was pretty luxurious for it's size.  Of course, the Mercedes Benz MLK or the Lincoln thingy offer a little more luxury than the Suburban... but they just didn't come close to having enough space for him to cram in everything he needs to cram into it.

I really like being a passenger in the Suburban.  The front bucket seats are very comfortable.  Our truck has heated seats, lumbar support, and a bunch of other adjustments to make sure you get comfortable.

When all three benches are installed in the truck, there is enough seating to move a small city!  One time we had seven large adults and a baby in her car seat in the truck and everyone was comfortable for a two-hour drive.  No one complained about cramped legs or cramped butts.

Another thing I really like about the truck is that it has a single CD player in the dash.  I didn't get the CD player option with my car because the only option was a six-disk changer in the trunk and I think that's crappie.  I like having the CD player right at my fingertips!

The climate control system is also set up really nicely.  There are two zones.  The front passengers have one zone and the back two seats are the second zone.  From the front, the driver has the option of controlling the temperature and fan speed for both zones.  However, if the back of the truck has adults or older children, the driver can click a switch and the back seat passengers have control of their own climate.

The truck offers all time 4-wheel drive (either 4 HI or 4 Low), full time 2-wheel drive (2-low), or an automatic setting where the truck senses road conditions and chooses the correct setting.  Gas mileage is best in full time 2-wheel drive, but the automatic setting is nice when the roads are "iffy".  Also, it's very easy to switch between the settings.

Gas mileage is very low.  But if you really need the truck for utilitarian purposes... the cost of the gas is still cheaper than hiring a shipping, moving, or trucking service.

I don't know much about the engine specs.  But I do know my husband is very happy with it.  I drive a 1999 Mercedes Benz C230 Kompressor -- which is a supercharged 4-cylinder engine.  I have much more torque in my car than in the truck.  Merging into traffic from a dead stop requires more lead room in the truck and it feels sluggish as it goes up the speedometer.  However, at cursing speeds the ride is comfortable.  I've also noticed the breaks on the truck feel a little squishier than the breaks on my car.  But my husband says that's just the difference between "American Brakes" and "German Brakes."

The down side to the truck is its size.  I know that's the main reason we got it... but it's hard to parallel park (which we HAVE to do because the truck is parked on the street) and I always feel a little uncomfortable backing up in a crowded parking lot.  My husband is quite a bit taller than I am and he says he has no trouble seeing the corners of the truck.  He feels it's easier to park, because the outside of the truck is straight up and down... so he says he always knows where he is.

However, I'm only 5'2" and I can't see the corners of the truck.  I'm dependent on mirrors, swinging my head around like a Looney, and hoping that people inside and outside the truck will help direct me.  I have been parallel parking everyday for over ten years and I can squeeze a normal size car into almost any spot.  I once parked a car in a spot and when I was done there was only 1/2 inch from my front bumper to the back bumper in front of me AND about 1/2 inch from my back bumper to the front bumper behind me!  I KNOW HOW TO PARALLEL PARK!  But I just can't get used to doing it in the truck.

But what it comes down to is need.  The truck is comfortable, functional, and fun. If you need the size, this truck is well worth it and I highly suggest you take a look at it.  If you don't really need that much space, it might be overkill for you... but it's still worth taking a look!
