            Don't be startled, I love my car - I just hate it's behavior!  I bought my Ford Taurus used by a Hertz Rental Car company with 18,000 miles on it.  After 3 years my car has been into the service shop 13 times for mechanical and structural problems.  I tried to get some help through the original Ford dealership to warranty my car after the extended warranty was expired because on the last service, my transmission had gone out at 46,000 miles!  They didn't even reply, so I went to the Dispute/Settlement Board for Ford Motor Company and they told me I didn't meet the board criteria because my car had 18,400 miles on it when I bought it and the cut-off was 18,000 miles for dispute.  So, I bought a car that was built on Friday at 5 p.m. - the only thing I like about it is that does run well when it isn't in the shop.<br><br>
