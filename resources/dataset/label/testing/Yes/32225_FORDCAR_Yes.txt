            Excursion, Expedition, Explorer - all EXCELLENT, but when you want to get back to the BASICS, go BRONCO.  My 1995 XLT, bought new in '95, is my sixth Bronco and will be with me for some time.  Here is why:  1. Push a button on the dash and the rear door window ROLLS down.  Can't do that with any &quot;E&quot; truck.  2. Spare tire is inside.  3. When my new '93 Bronco developed a condition where it would just quit and the dealership was unable to find the cause, Ford GAVE me a brand new '94 XLT.  Now that is sticking behind the product!

We pull my 27' Formula boat just fine with the towing package and the large engine keeps us up to speed in traffic.  Mileage could be better but I'll sacrifice a little gas to get where I'm going on time in style and comfort.

Though not used much the FWD sure comes in handy on steep ramps and deep sand.  I've never come close to getting stuck and have actually pulled a couple of beach rangers out of deep sand.

The sound system is great in that big sound chamber and the leather seats with pushbutton lumbar support add comfort to a long or short ride.

Visibility is superb sitting up high and you feel safe.  Handling is very good for a truck of this nature - we call it our &quot;sport truck&quot;.

OK, there are a few drawbacks - the cruise control module under the hood rusted out moments after the warranty ran out, you only go 12 to 14 miles on a gallon of gas, and the paint job on the hood could be thicker.  

I plan to keep this Bronco for a long time since it has features the new E trucks don't have.... and it's paid for!<br><br>
