            Ah! The Volvo station wagon - the workhorse of the upper middle class suburbanite. I was sure that our 1983 240 would be destined to be my first car and that it would run until I died. (Fortunately, we moved out of the country and had to sell the car.) Volvo has always had the world's safest mobile Scandinavian milk cartons with its faithful following. Now with cost-conscious downsizing, a new market niche is appearing - the compact sport wagon (three words that in any combination are abhorrent to me). Volvo was not to be left behind in its own game!

So for the past four years, Volvo has been hotly selling its V40 wagon for those who wanted more car than a Golf but not the financial damage incurred by the titanic Bavarian and ChryslerDiamler-werkes. These set the trend which the A4 Avant and soon-to-be-available 323i Sport Wagon have come to follow.

The V40 shares tremendous similarity with the S40 sedan. I would go as far as to say first that the V40 is a HATCHBACK S40! In another review of the S40, I note that the S40 is a smoothed out 850. The V40 has no such kin. Though the front is a smoothed out Volvo design similar to the S40, the rear is a very well-rounded shape reminiscent of newer Audi designs. Overall, it looks very slick! This smooth design makes the BMW Sport Wagon looks a bit angular. Unlike the sedan, the V40 looks very down-to-earth. Besides the different visual image this car evokes, the V40 is essentially identical to the sedan in mechanics. There is a single large oval exhaust pipe. The wipers on the headlights are cute, though the windshield wipers look cheap and flimsy. Again, I applaud Volvo�s doing away with chrome trim and using black or body colored plastic as its only body colors. However, the large panel of shiny black plastic between the taillights is beyond me. The wheels are appealing and standard on all 40's. Overall, the V40 and its sedan sister (V40) are two handsome looking cars and are as un-Volvo as you may think.

Everyone knows theses are safe cars. This car has WHIPS, SIPS, ABS, DSA, Yada, yada, and yada. Translation: every state-of-the-art safety mechanism is available. But safety is not the issue with this car. 

As with the sedan, the interior looks ample but not cavernous. The wagon space is immediately apparent as being a small area behind the rear seats. It looks as if someone just connected the rear lip of the sedan with the roof. Enough room for another big duffle bag, really. 30 cubic feet with the back seats up and 61 with them down is not staggering cargo space. And the rear bumper is rather high and narrow which will inhibit sitting in the bay and tailgating like you could with the big older models. The bay is by no means the mobile playpen where babies and dogs could romp while cruising. However, this space is useful for carrying larger items as the cargo space extends from the floor to ceiling. You could not really sleep comfortably back there, either. However, this quasi-cargo carrying capacity is an interesting feature of this class of cars. 

The 40 series seats four a little better than an A4. The driver�s legroom is not as wide as a 3-series but this car has the best room for people with long legs in its class. The previously horrendous interior design of the Volvo has been replaced with something more modest. The dash is sharp and clean, though the curved plastic dust shield casts a warped glare across the instruments when driving away from the sun. The stereo is typically odd, but functional. The trip computer has its controls on the dash with tiny buttons which make it dangerous to operate while driving. More functions on the wheel or sticks would have been better. The interior leather is particularly nice and plush with nice side panels of leather in the door as well. Though the anatomical wood inlaid shifter looks nice, why does the arm rest and parking brake look so cheap? The interior wood trim looks as silly as it does in any small car. The seats are comfortable and have awesome headrests but are not very wide. The lumbar support is not a plus but a must. The ride position is a little high. This affords a very good view out the front. Headroom is accommodated with a sweeping arc through the ceiling.

When the ignition is turned on, the car lets out a deep rumble. This is a bit amusing coming from a wagon. However, since the car is 45 lbs heavier than the sedan, it appears to be even less responsive than the sedan. The 4-cylinder engine is very eager and the turbo extracts good extra power. Being a wagon, I suppose this powerplant is sufficient. The brakes are the same as the sedan and are as soft through its travel, though functional. The steering is very soft and power-assisted with little road feel. The four-speed automatic does shift very smoothly and is willing to be pressed. However, the cabin noise level can become quite high. The 1.9 L 4-cylinder turbo is a product of a long line of good Volvo turbo engines. Producing 160 hp @ 5100 rpm and 170 ft-lb @1800 rpm it should be a strong engine, but it does not have the alacrity or response which its Bavarian rivals possess. With a higher driving position, this car, though it handles very well for normal driving, tends to have more roll than its German rivals when cornering briskly. The V40 drives very much like the S40 without significant body twist or feeling that your rear is holding you back. More reason to suspect that the V40 is really just a marsupialized S40.

The Volvo 40 series comes equipped with all standard mechanical features for its base price. Options get you sunroof, leather, and other creature comforts. The SPORT packages are comical �sporty-look� cosmetics packages with no real sport tuning of the car - somewhat sillier on the wagon. The options are not very cheap either. If you can�t live without the silver paint, sunroof or leather or nice stereo (which is really nicer than the stock) you will have to pay for that. 

Dealers know this car has had a four year trial in Europe with good mechanical reviews. It also comes with an excellent 4 year bumper-to-bumper everything-but-gas warranty (one up on its Teutonic brethren) as well as 24-hour roadside assistance. And of course, its safety reputation is unparalleled.

I think if you are going to buy a wagon - you should by a wagon. The V40 has a good look to it - something different. And that is by no means a bad reason for purchasing this car. I feel it is best suited for people who like sedans but occasionally need extra space for road trips or boxes or balloons. For a Volvo, this is one smooth piece of engineering and hopefully a indication of things to come. And unlike the sedan, no one can fault you for buying a Volvo wagon.

Happy touring.<br><br>
