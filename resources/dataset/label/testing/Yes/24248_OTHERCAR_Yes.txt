            This is the best SUV every.  The ride and comfort of an everyday car, even a sports car. The great thing about it is being able to do many other things as well. Need to hual a boat? Go off in the woods? Snow-plow? Well this does it all. All from a very cozy cabin. Chevy has done a great thing here for the rugged outdoor man. they have out him in something big, but comfortable and something that looks presentable. Weather it is used for family trips, or taking it in the woods for hunting, you can do both. The powerful vortec V8 gets you up and going. Enough power to drag other sports cars at the nearest stop light, or pulling a boat up a mountain pass. So far there is nothing this car can not do. A pleasure to drive, lok at, own, and use. <br><br>
