            I recently moved from San Diego to Rochester, NY to take a job teaching Computer Science at The State University of New York at Geneseo.  I have to drive about 30 miles (one way) to work each day and so I wanted a reliable car which would perform well in the winter weather.  I have owned Mercedes in California, but didnot want to invest that kind of money for a car which would be subjected to corrosive road conditions.  I test drove several vehicles and decided the VW Jetta was very close to the Mercedes in many respects at less than half of the price.  So, three months ago, I bought a 2000 Jetta with standard transmission and the leather interior option package.

To say the least, I am more than satisfied with my purchase.  Where to start?

On those cold mornings when the wind chills you right to the bone, the electrically heated seats are just what the doctor ordered.  When I purchased the car, I thought who wants those seats? But, they came along with the model and options I ordered.  Now, I am so glad I have them.  Not only are they cozy when riding in the car, but my back feels so good for hours after the trip.  If you have any sort of back problems, the electrically heated seats will help ease your aches and pains.  

The brakes (ABS) must have been invented for winter driving on snow and ice.  In California, one doesn't often get a chance to appreciate the value of the ABS.  During the first snow storm this year, I found the car to be stable and it gave me a feeling of safety.  The best part of the feeling was the braking action.....smooth, sure and best of all quiet!  Perhaps because it is build low, the Jetta also performs well in the snow.  Very little slipping and sliding.  And, the traction was easy to maintain; all I had to do was stop using low gear and switch to starting out in second.

And then there is the fuel economy feature.  I do not drive expressways to and from work.  I drive on country roads and surface streets.  I use the economy grade regular gasoline and I get 27 miles per gallon.  Actually, I get more than 27 mpg -- sometimes, almost 28.  I expected to get better than 20 mpg, but this car has surpassed my expectations with its exceptional gas mileage.

Overall pleasure is also derived from comments in the supermarket parking lot when people compliment the smooth styling and sleek lines of my black jetta.  My only complaint along these lines is that I purchased a black model and it awfully difficult to keep it clean.<br><br>
