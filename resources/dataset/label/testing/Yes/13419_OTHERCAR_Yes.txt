            Being short and small, I have always hated freeway driving until I bought my 1996 Chevy Blazer.  I love it!!!!! Now when I am on the road I feel like I can see everything around me.  I use to suffer from Panic Attacks all the time when I drove on the freeway, now I do not.  I also like it because it is one of the smaller SUV's so I don't feel totally over powered like in my friends Tahoe.  Though it is perfect for me, if you are over 6 feet tall and 195 pounds, I would not recommend it.  My friend is a big guy and he barely fits in it. The only thing I don't like about my Blazer is the turning radius.  But Im sure I would get that with any SUV I was to buy.  Oh Yea, no more sliding off the road in the snow.  Thats a definite plus:)<br><br>
