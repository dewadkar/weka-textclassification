            With all due respect to those who enjoy their BMWs, I've simply never 
gotten much enjoyment out of any of the ones I've driven.  Over the years I've driven a 3, 5, and 7 series, as well as a Z3 recently.  Simply put, their safety measures (weight) render them bulky, and absolutey not nimble at all.  They've seemed to gained a sporty reputation, but they simply don't handle like you'd expect.  I currently own an Alfa Romeo 164 (1993), and this car totally outperforms the BMW in it's class (530).  I also enjoy having a car that does not appear 7 times on every block, as does the BMW.  I also respect BMWs history, but again Alfa Romeo has them beat here, with nearly 100 years of design and build history, pre-dating and including early Ferrari.  As well, BMW now hides their engines under an odd plastic cover, whereas Alfa leaves the beauty of their amazing power plants in plain view.  It is also a shame that BMW only recently began using DeDion suspension, which has been the norm for Alfa for several years.  And the Alfa Romeo 164 has any BMW beat as far as engine sound goes....the smoothest and most beautiful this side of Ferrari.  If you want a safe, predictable, faux-sporty vehicle, go for BMW, but if not try an Alfa Romeo 164....you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br><br>
