            We are on our second Mercury Sable, and I would buy another one.  The cars are comfortable, even for long trips and for back seat passengers.  Control panels are attractive and most controls are convenient to use (except I still haven't found the rear window defroster).

One of our Sable's is a station wagon.  It is our second Sable, and before we bought it we looked at SUVs and Minivans.  The deciding factor was the amount of room in the Sable.

We have loaded a week's worth of luggage, trays of plants, sports equipment and a couple of cat cages in -- no problem.  We have brought home bulky finds from our favorite second-hand furniture store.  And we often just slide out bicycles in the back.

Even with passengers in the back seat, there is plenty of storage room.  We have a roof rack, but rarely use it.

The wagon (now at 85,000 miles) has done well mechanically.  Unfortunately, the same isn't true for the sedan.  It had a mysterious electrical problem early on.  We called AAA to get it started so many times that a tow truck driver finally showed me how to crawl under the front of the car and bang around on the starter.

&quot;Please don't call us anymore,&quot; he said.  And I didn't, although it wasn't always pleasant kneeling in puddles swinging away at the starter with a tire iron or tennis racquet.

A mechanic fixed the problem on about the 10th try, and since then there have been no problems, unless you count the stretch of time during which the car would not start after it was put into &quot;Park.&quot;  We just left it in &quot;Neutral&quot; for a year or so with the key in the ignition.  It wasn't stolen despite the fact that car theft is not unheard of in our town, and soon enough it cured itself.

Now, in its old age (closing in on 100,000) it runs perfectly.

All in all, for the money the Sable is a great car.
