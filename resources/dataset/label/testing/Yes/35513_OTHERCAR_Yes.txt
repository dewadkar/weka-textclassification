            I got this vehicle because I needed a car quickly, and considering the price and quality it appeared to be the best at the time. A positive aspect of the car is the food tray that connects to the driver's seat and can folded out. Another very positive aspect is the back seat. Since it folds into the floor, when something large needs to be placed in the vehicle, you do not have to go through the hassle of either taking out the seat, or trying desperately for an hour, trying to cram something in. Also when the seat folds out, there is extra space in the trunk, caused by the indentation for the seat. So it is beneficial both way. One last aspect that is good, is the middle seats, can slide together or apart (depending on your needs.) A negative is that it makes large sound while going over bumps in the Road (it is not just typical bump noises.) This may just be mine, but I'm not sure. Overall it seats eight people. And is quite spacious. The mpg rate isn't too bad, but it isn't the worst<br><br>
