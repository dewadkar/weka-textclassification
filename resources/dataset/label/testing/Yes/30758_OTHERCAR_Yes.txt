            I received my Olympus D-340R Digital Camera as an early birthday gift and I have fallen in love with the little guy.  The camera has great resolution (1.3 megapixel or 1280x960) and a great price (about $300).  At this point, I have nearly made back my wife's $300 in money I have saved by not buying film or developing costs.

The photo quality of this camera is outstanding for the price!  The camera does a great job of catching dynamic and vivid color, even is poor light. It compares favorable even with cameras that cost hundreds more and have more megapixels.

The beauty to digital photography is that you only have to keep the shots that turn out well and you never have to worry about the &quot;blurred&quot; pictures.  You just erase them!  With the D-340R, it is very easy to preview pics on the bright and responsive 1.8 inch LCD.  The software bundle is also exceptional, so you can edit pictures after the fact or stitch together a panoramic view.

On the down side, the controls are not digitally built into the camera through the LCD.  They are on top like a traditional camera. Also, though the camera has the cool ability to capture action sequences (it can snap a series of ten burst shots at half-second intervals) it is only at low resolution only without flash.  Also, when you take pictures using the LCD exclusively, it sucks the batteries pretty quickly.

Overall, This camera is a fantastic bargain and I highly recommend it!  Get while you still can!<br><br>
