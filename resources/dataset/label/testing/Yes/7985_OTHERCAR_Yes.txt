            <b>How I Bought This Camera</b>
What attracted me to the Minolta S414 camera was the price (bought it from $315) and the amount of mega pixels it had (4 mega pixels). At first, I overlooked it because usually high mega pixel cameras for a low price mean bad picture quality or lack of features (cough, cough, SiPix cameras). But after reading reviews online from http://www.dpreview.com/ and http://www.steves-digicams.com, I started to really get interested in this camera and what it had to offer. Please visit those review sites as they go over features which I will not go over since they do a great job of doing it, I might as well not try and duplicate the same material. So I bought the camera from http://www.digitalfotoclub.com for about $315 dollars online + about $15.00 S&H. I received it in a timely manner by UPS Ground.

After I have had this camera for about 3 months, I decided to write this review. 

<b>Getting Up & Running</b>
I purchased 4 NiMH 2100mah batteries and a charger from www.greenbattery.com which were the highest capacity batteries available at that time. Later I learned the battery life on the camera is decent, but by all means, not great. I got an average of say 125 pictures or more some with flash. It is imperative that you do buy rechargeable batteries because alkaline batteries will go so quick it&#146s like throwing away money. Also, I recommend picking up a 128MB or 256MB compact flash card because taking pictures at 4 mega pixels fills up a memory card very fast. A good, cheap, reliable place to buy compact flash cards is www.newegg.com

Taking pictures is quite easy! Turn the dial to &#147auto&#148 and start taking pictures! Review the pictures you have taking by turning the dial to the &#147play&#148 icon and you can see the pictures you have taken. A tip for taking good pictures is to first hold down the button half way so it beeps to show it is in focus. Then take your picture. The picture is taken almost instantaneous. 

If you are the one who likes to take close up pictures, the camera has an excellent &#147macro mode&#148, which allows you to take pictures as close as 16cm. The pictures are razor sharp.  The macro mode can be switched on by clicking the photo type selector button on the camera once, which is quite easy. 

If you have Windows XP, you just plug the included USB cable to it and turn the dial to the USB logo and it will automatically identify the camera so you can take the pictures off it. 

<b>Picture Quality</b>
Picture quality is absolutely excellent considering you have decent lighting. If you want to see a few sample shots of what I did with this camera, you can visit this link: http://www.photosig.com/go/users/userphotos?id=116331 

Outdoor shots in &#147auto mode&#148 turn out very well most of the time. Colors are generally accurate so post processing of shots is not required as much. 

Indoor shots are where things get tricky. In indoor lighting, most shots in &#147auto mode&#148 turn out with a yellow tint. This definitely does not look so great and I find it the biggest flaw. But yes! There is a way to go around it. Using manual mode, you can adjust the &#147white balance&#148 and change it to &#147tungsten&#148. This will make indoor shots with accurate colors. Manual mode is extremely useful to learn as you can tweak your shots.
