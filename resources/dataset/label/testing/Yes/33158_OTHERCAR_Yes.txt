            Bearing in mind that my favorite mode of travel is on a bicycle, taking one's son out of school for college campus visits makes that impractical. We rented a 2000 Malibu for 8 days and 1400 miles, driving through New England and the Finger Lakes region.
The Malibu never showed any sign of anything short of sure-footedness as we wound through State highways and County roads. The wheelbase is one of those nice compromises that gives a smooth ride without handling like an aircraft carrier. The V6 engine had muscle enough for the occasional highway merge, but only used a gallon of gas every 28 miles or so. And the headroom, hiproom and legroom kept a six-foot Dad and his taller son comfortable. The luggage had room to rattle in the trunk, too.
There were two small drawbacks worth mentioning: The steering is somewhat stiff, although after a day or two I ceased to notice. And the glossy acrylic accent piece across the dash has the annoying ability to reflect a &quot;hot spot&quot; in almost every position the sun can take. But this is the first GM car I've driven that I would seriously consider buying.<br><br>
