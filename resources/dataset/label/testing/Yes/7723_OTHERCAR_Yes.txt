            Four years ago a buddy of mine had 4 kids, 4 tickets (left for the office at 3 am every morning, used to pick him off at the Peter Pank diner doing 80 every morning) and needed out of his 92 911.  The dealer he was buying his BMW 740 from was offering him $22k for a car worth at least $40k on the trade.  I offered to split the difference, he believe it or not, took off $1,000 because the front wheels needed to be cleaned, but the deal was done.  I didn't even realize it was a Tiptronic when I offered, but when you've got a deal like this, you take it.

I've had it 4 years and keep it like a child.  It's Eggplant (deep purple) with tan leather, and except for some small problems, it is a blast.  Everyone thinks it's newer than it is.  Some troubles:

The car had 17&quot; Turbo wheels that were a fairly unique finish, like those in the epinions picture.  No one could provide more wheels, and they were relatively weak, so they bent or cracked often.  I've since put Scott's $1,000 towards a $2,400 set of Kenesis Supercup 3 piece wheels which have been wonderful.  I stayed with 17&quot;, everyone was suggesting 18&quot; or bigger, but I had good tires AND could you imagine how often I'd bend 18&quot; wheels in Manhattan?.  Not only do the three piece wheels look GREAT, you can replace the inner or outer rim pieces only if they ever do bend (2 years, just little dents as of now!).

The car has most of the original look of the 911's with modern interior appointments and goodies and the wider fenders of the newer 911's.  If you put the tail up, it looks like a turbo without the cost.

Performance is nothing if not wonderful.  I long for reasons to get somewhere fast.  The car will do 90 on the Garden State like other cars do 45.  I've often looked down on a short 3 mile stretch of highway thinking I'm doing 60 and I'm near 100.  The rear engine configuration allows power to be put down in virtually any situation, even when wet.  I thought this might be because the automatic doesn't snap down power as well as a stick might, but I've asked others who own sticks and it's the same - the configuration just lets you put the power down (you actually can feel the FRONT wheels lift slightly over very bumpy pavement).  The car can pass on two lane roads with only the slimmest of space.

Most of the automobile magazines have called the interior layout at best 'eclectic'.  I don't think this is true.  These are people who drive many cars every few days.  When you get used to this car, there is nothing wrong with the layout - it just isn't like most other cars, for example, the ignition key is on the left (did you know that?).  In fact, this is my second Porsche.  I'm 6'1&quot; and almost 250 pounds.  Porsche's are the few sports cars I can fit in.

Part of the engine support fell out and had to be fixed - my brother wound up pulling the coil wires out of their boots when he did it.  The coils are attached to the car, the caps (two) are on the engine, and when you lower the engine, well, they're not long enough.

I don't recommend Porsche service (I take car of my car myself, my dad owns two gas stations).  Scott had only had Porsche service the car.  When we did our first oil change, the car holds 11 quarts of oil, half of it in a dry sump.  When we opened the dry sump, it was tough enough to open that we felt it had never been drained.  When we pulled off the nut, the white gunk around the nut that is the sign of small amounts of water separated from oil and sitting for some time confirmed this.  I remove all 11 quarts every 5000 miles and use only Mobil One Synthetic (for cars with less oil, I go 3000 miles the most).

The car had a slight ping when I bought it.  When I did a tuneup about a year ago, we pulled the distributor cap and one turned on it's own.  There is a small belt between the two caps (dual plug ignition for each cylinder as used in 1992) had broken.  When a new distributor was put in the ping was gone, and the car was much more powerful.

The standard stereo is a bit weak.  The former owner put an AEC amp under the seat with separates in the doors and plates over the rear seats (yes, there are small rear seats).  I added a bass tube that fits behind the passenger seat (I'm too big for it to fit behind mine) and if someone larger sits in the passenger seat, the small footwell box can be put inside the back seat.

The car is incredibly dependable and always draws a crowd.

I'll keep this for many more years.  It's paid for, looks great, runs great.<br><br>
