            This is the greatest car I have ever driven. It surpasses most other BMW's in its driving capabilities and pricetag. I leased this car for a year and was very pleased. Its interior is like that of a lugury sudan unless you sit in the back seat which is not a problem when you have children who can fit back there. Although I did not get many extras myself the car has many possibilities such as cd players, gps systems, car phones, and more. It saved me a lot of money on gas with its reletively small 4 cylinder engine, and was also suprisingly good in the snow. Even if you don't buy this model I strongly suggest buying some BMW because they are great cars all around.

If you liked my opinion please recommend it and put me on your trust list.<br><br>
