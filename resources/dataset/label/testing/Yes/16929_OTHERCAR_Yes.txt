            When I first saw the Outback, I was a little hesitant. It looked like it couldn�t make up its mind about whether it wanted to be an SUV or a wagon. But now, I know that it has succeeded in being both. 

Interior

From the moment I stepped inside, I was amazed at the combination of beauty and ruggedness in the interior. The trim is very stylish, and all of the buttons and dials are nice looking and well placed. It has map lights in the front and middle for reading or looking at a map for when you are lost. It has a glasses holder that flips down from in between the map lights. A handy little drink holder can be extended out of the dashboard at the press of a button. The radio is of the finest quality. Music comes alive in this car. All of the speakers are well placed, giving you the sense of the sound being all around you. The seats are extremely comfortable. They can recline or be up straight, and are good for taking quick nap in. They are soft, but not too soft, and are god for a long trip. On a cold day, they can be heated up as well if you purchase the right package with the car. One of the best things about the Outback is the way it combines style and substance. It is very sturdy inside, and it doesn�t seem like it will break easily. Everything is well made, yet still looks good. A lot of nice cars have beautiful interiors but can�t take a beating. This car can. The back seats are spacious, with plenty of head and neck room for everyone. They can be folded forward if you want to add more room to the already huge storage area in back.

Exterior/Mechanical

This car is just as nice on the outside as it is on the inside. It sports fog lights, a sturdy roof rack for bikes, kayaks etc. The paint job is great and wont scratch easily. The fenders and bumpers are rock solid. Under the hood is a beast of an engine. It performs well on and off road. However, this car still has some elements of a station wagon in it, so don�t expect to go zooming over logs. The suspension is great, and allows for a smooth ride even in rough conditions. The engine is very quiet too. This car is available in both automatic and manual transmission, depending on your taste as a driver. It comes with great All-Wheel-Drive, which means it performs great under harsh conditions. 


All in all, this car is definitely worth your attention
