            When People come to me and say "Andy, what do Honda make?" I would same "Motorbikes, silly!" I would not automatically say "Cars". I was watching a programme last night and discovered they are the leader in the Outboard boat engine market too! 
Honda claims not to do things by halves - and it's hard to argue. Some Manufacturesrs build sports coupes, Honda makes the legendary NSX supercar. 
Where others provide diesels, Honda has VTEC petrol power and where others offer small family runabouts, Honda serves up the Civic. 
A bit bigger than a Fiesta and a bit smaller than a focus, a Civic sits in a bracket all of its own. 
The best selling member of the Civic family is the Swindon-built 5-door hatchback model, also available in 'Aero deck' estate form. This looks like a Subaru or Volvo or similar estate car but its not my favourite model in the range. 
Here however, we're looking at the smaller three and 5-door hatchback that has recently been revised and with most now featuring air conditioning as standard equipment. 
You're unlikely to find this feature in equivalent large superminis or small coupes, where you'll usually pay extra for the privilege of keeping your cool. 
I liken its new look to a baby people carrier. You know, the Ford Galaxy and Renault Espace are 2 such examples. 
In all its guises, the latest Civic range claims to be much stronger, a lot quieter and much cleaner than before. 
Vibration and harshness from under the bonnet which is aided by the dampening now built into the bonnet itself. This new material is meant to be "acoustically tuned" to reduce engine and road noise for the occupants. 
The VTEC engines themselves have recently been replaced with more efficient and environmentally friendly Versions to comply with the newly imposed round of European emissions standards. 

New technology is used to improve stopping power, too. 
All models are now fitted with ABS systems also have Electric Brake Distribution (EBD), which provides better braking by applying more force where it is needed most. No more soft points under hard braking. 
Meanwhile on the outside, different bumpers and headlights give the three-door a stronger, more macho look, that matches the harsh look of its big brother, the Accord. I really do like these changes as it gives the car a more European flavour and rounds off some of its Japanese influences. 

Perhaps it's down to the styling that I like this car so much. less restrained on the smaller cars, instantly recognisable by their huge, carefully-styled headlamps. Look beyond those big,bulging headlight Eyes staring at you, and there are plenty of other equally significant design features. 

The Civic's curvy shape and sloped front end give the impression of a small Fiesta-sized car. In fact, it's longer, wider and taller than an ordinary supermini or small coupe. Plenty of leg and headroom means people of tall statures can travel comfortably in the rear. 
All around vision is aided with narrow rear window pillars make for easy reversing, and a long wheelbase and standard split-folding rear seat enables the Civic to carry enough luggage for a family weekend break. Its no giant when it comes to load space but most loads can be carried comfortably. 


Even this 1.4-litre three-door version, now comes with state-of-the-art 16-valve engines developing almost 90BHP. If you'd like a bit more power, the sporty 1.6-litre VTEC DOHC VTi hatch and coupe variants develop an outstanding 140BHP. This unit is tuned very much for performance. 

The driving experience on offer does not rule them out from being one of the best on the market. 
Whatever the gear, you'll find the Civic is happy to hurl themselves all the way to a whooping 115mph in the 1.4 engine. 
Rest to 60mph actually takes eight seconds which is quite a long time despite its revised braking system. 
Honda has recently introduced a new Sport trim grade for the three-door hatch. It now has alloy wheels and a leather-rimmed steering. 

As mentioned earlier, equipment levels are good, with all models featuring driver and passenger airbags and seatbelt pretensioners as well as an immobiliser. Anti-lock brakes, electric windows, air conditioning, a sunroof and power steering are standard on most models too. The prices remain competitive, starting at ï¿½12,000 on the road. 

This is a great small car to both own and drive and one we considered when updating the wife's car. Now we have the Beemer, It looks like we wont be needing it. Still, a great car to drive
