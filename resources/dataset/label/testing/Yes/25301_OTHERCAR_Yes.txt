            Excellent reproduction for cost.  Excellent resolution and more than satisfactory resolution.  Easily makes excellent print reproductions that are a better quality than 35mm.  Camera easy to use as it operates in both manual or automatic modes.  Uses 4 AA batteries to add life to number of pictures it can take before power dies.  Nikon lens is, as usual of Nikon quality, excellent.  Have used camera for six months with only satisfactory results.  Especially like macro feature which allows pictures to be taken within 3 inches of subject.  Camera is built to fit hand and all features are within easy reach.  Anyone looking for high quality results at a moderate cost should consider purchasing this product.<br><br>
