            I am on my second Olds Bravada.  I guess that tells you I am sold on them.  My first on was a 1997.  I had had a Chevy Blazer prior to that, which was fine, but it rode and drove like a truck.  If you are looking for something with a car like ride and the versatility of having some advantages of a truck, the Bravada is for you.  

I now have a 1999 Bravada and have enjoyed some of the subtle changes they have made.  For instance, the back seat has better head rests than before and safety for my passengers is always a concern.  I also like the fact that it has dual airbags now.  The model I drive has a power sun roof and CD/cassette player which is a nice option.  The last Bravada I had came with the &quot;gold&quot; package, while this one came with their &quot;platinum&quot; package, both which include a multitude of options.  Memory seats are great considering there is a 7 inch difference in height between my husband and myself.  Just a touch of the standard keyless remote and the drivers seat is ready for you at your settings - no more fooling around trying to get it just right after someone else has driven.  I have four large dogs and we are always working on our home, so trips to the home improvement center or vet don't pose a problem with the adequate cargo space.  If you have children or animals or are remodeling, the Bravada can handle all of the above orders.  I have even brought home a few pieces of dry wall on the Bravada!

Since the Bravada is an all wheel drive vehicle, the turning radius is more limited than in a regular vehicle or even a 4 wheel drive vehicle - BUT - I have learned to compensate in my driving skills.  Driving the Bravada is well worth it.

A few other things about the Bravada - 3 years or 36,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty is hard to beat.  I can say from having the previous Bravada that Oldsmobile is very concerned about customer satisfaction.  The 24 hour road side assistance that is included when you purchase a Bravada is a great perk also.
