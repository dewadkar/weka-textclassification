            I have just purchased a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am GT, so I have only had it for a short while, but I think I can give an honest opinion on the car.

The car retails for about $22,600.  Currently, GM is offering $3000 cash back on the Grand Am or 0% financing.  You can't beat that.  I wanted a red or black Grand Am GT, but you had to buy the leather and XM radio if you went with those colors.  At least, that's all the dealership I went to had.  So we went with the Silver coupe and got it for $16,500 with all the rebates, hagling, and fees they tack on at the end.

The coupe has the 3.4L Ram Air V6 engine, which produces 175 hp.  It's also got power windows, and the driver's side goes down with one touch, but you have to hold the button to make the window go back up.  It's got power mirrors, but the knobs feel a little chincy, or cheap.  It's also got power door locks with remote keyless entry.  The remote keyless entry has a trunk release and panic button as well.  There is also a 2-way power driver's seat.  Basically, the seat will move up or down, but will require manual adjustment to move it back or forward.  Personally, I could have done without this useless feature.

The car comes with a power sunroof, which you can slide back or just vent.  It also has a rear defogger, 3/4 split folding rear seat, a CD player and a cassette player, with premium speakers, or the 6 speaker package.  Personally, I would rather not have the overpriced cassette player.

The speaker system sounds pretty good.  There are 6 speakers in all, with two tiny tweeters by the side mirrors up front.  The bass sounds pretty good for a factory system.  The CD player is easy to use and understand.  Changing the clock does not require you to read the manual, and the red LED display is easy to see during the day.  There are several EQ options to choose from, or you can customize one of your own.

The car also comes with low profile tires, polished aluminum rims, and a spoiler.  The dashboard has a 150 MPH speedometer, a tachometer, a gas gage, and a temperature gauge.  There is also a cruise control on the leather-wrapped steering wheel.

The seats are nice and firm, and there's a decent amount of room in the car considering it's size.  I am 6'4" and there's just enough headroom.  The leg room is lacking, but then again, it's a Grand Am.  The back seats are decent for this sized car, but if you're an adult, you're probably not not going to be very comfortable.  I should also mention the dual front airbags, antilock brakes, and traction control.

Let's talk about how the car drives.  For those of you who like a little growl from your engine, you'll enjoy this engine.  If you like your car quiet like the Toyota Camary, then you will think this car is loud.  Personally, I like the growl, so I think the car is very fun to drive.  Accelleration is moderate unless you mash the gas; then it really goes, but the low end torque seems worse than our old 99 4 banger Grand Am.  Although it does have a little growl which is always nice.

The car corners well, but that too should be obvious with the wider, lower profile tires.  The car also feels balanced, so it turns well without making the car wobble.  The steering wheel has a solid feel to it.  There's just the right amount of play, but you still feel like you have control over where the car goes.

Honestly, I thought the car would handle better.  It's ok, but I don't think it handles any better than our old 99 bare-bones Grand Am, and considering this is the GT, it should.

The body of the car is what sold my wife and I.  We just love the sporty look.  It's got fog lights, and rear lights to light up the road behind you so you can see while you're going in reverse.

The Grand Am comes with the standard GM 3 year/36,000 mile warranty, which is nothing to write home about these days.  That says to me that GM expects things to start breaking at around 40,000 miles.  Why else would they not match Hyandai's 10 year 100,000 mile warranty?  Even Dodge has a 7 year/70,000 mile powertrain warranty, which covers major engine parts as well as the transmission; no such confidence from GM.  We just got done with a 4 year lease on a 1999 Grand Am, and we rarely had troubles with that, so I am expecting good things with this car.
