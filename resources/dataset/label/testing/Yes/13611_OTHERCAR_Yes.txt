            In December of '98, I bought my 1996 Chevy S-10 ZR2.. when I got it, it had about 29k miles on it. To be honest, I really wasn't looking for a ZR2.. I was in the market for a Dodge Dakota or a Subaru 2.5RS. While I had seen ads for these trucks, I had never really seen a used one at any lots until December. I just HAD to buy it.. I haven't been disappointed thus far..

I don't know what it is about this truck, but it just makes me smile when I drive it. I love the wide stance and the large tires. It took a bit of getting used to, but I love the stiff suspension and the general off-road prowess of this truck. Last winter when we had a couple feet of snow out here I was able to get around in it with NO problems what-so-ever.. I felt invincible.. it has plenty of power I have had no problems hauling many different size loads.. 

As far as maintinance is concerned, I have only had to have basic maintenance done, like changing oil, fluids, brakes, etc.. one qualm I have with this truck is that it EATS BRAKES!! I have heard that this is a problem with the ZR2's.. they use the same brakes as the regular 4x4s and since they're trying to stop larger heavier tires they wear out quicker.. also, I have a strange clanking sound when I stop.. this has just occured recently so I am hoping it is nothing big.. otherwise this has been maitnance-free.. OH.. the gas milage isn't too great either.. so if you don't have money to burn for gas and you drive a lot, this vehicle is not for you.. (I tend to get btw 15 - 17 MPG city and about 18 or so Highway).. 

However, driving this vehicle is very satisfying to me! While the turning radius isn't the greatest, it does handle very well off-road and on.. with the off-road tires it is a bit noisy and I believe this contributes to the bad milage.. but overall, it sticks to the road pretty well in dry weather, it's a bit shifty in wet weather, but give it some snow or mud and it'll just eat it right up.. it is a VERY solid-feeling vehicle! 

I would reccomend this vehicle to someone who is single or does not have a family due to the fact that the back seats are for display purposes only.. Also, if you're not going to go off-roading, I'd recommend NOT getting the ZR2 package.. I enjoy it, but if you are just going to use it for hauling stuff and as a good winter vehicle the regular S-10 4x4 would probably be a better choice.. <br><br>
