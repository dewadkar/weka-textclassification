            Recently I went into Best Buy to get a digital camera. It had been something that I was looking into for a while. But of course, I'm looking for something reasonably priced. When I went in I saw a lot of differnet cameras, but many were way too expensive. Amung the cheaper ones was the Fuji FinePix 1300. It was on sale for $238. I looked over the features and took a picture and decided that I would buy it. It turned out to be a great investment.

Right out of the box, all the camera needs to start taking pictures is four AA batteries. According to some sites, you can get about 366 shots on one set of batteries. It really depends though. There is a little one and a half inch screen on the camera to see what you are taking a picture of, but it really drains the battery life a lot. According to the book included, it can take about 400 shots with the screen off, and half that with the screen on.

The picture quality is pretty good too. It is a 1.3 megapixel camera and can get images up to 1024 X 768, though I usually use the 640 X 480 so I can get pictures small enough to send through email. With the included 8 Meg Smart card, I managed to get about a mix of 80 or so pictures on it. Software is included to get the pictures to your computer via USB cables, and it works fine, thought there is no more software included.

Taking pictures is and reviewing them after you have done so is fairly easy. After taking a shot, all you have to do is rotate a knob on the camera to take you to a different menu where you can see all the pictures in the memory. There is a seperate menu for other things such as resolution and stuff and the controls on the camera are easy to use.

One note is that I recommend using the flash on the camera most of the time. It has a feature to "fix" pictures that do not use a flash but they end up looking faded and blurry most of the time. Using the flash gives you a more colorful, sharper image.

I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to get an introduction in the world of digital cameras. If you plan to use a camera for heavy duty photo editing stuff, you might want a better model with more features, but if you want a camera to take casual pictures, this one may be for you.
