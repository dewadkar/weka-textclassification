            I have a villager, a 1993. It is very dependable. As a matter of fact, my villager has more than 240,000 miles on it and it still runs great. This van will be my oldest son's first vehicle in another year and a half. Dependable-yes!!!!! The van drives like a car, has plenty of room for my husband and my 3 children along with their sports gear. I'm sold on the vehicle and would recommend it to anyone. I have had very little repairs done to my van in all the years I had this. Good, dependable vehicle.

I was planning on getting another villager for my next vehicle, if the price is right, but I fell in love with the Olds Silhoutte - read my reviews on this one. I just bought an olds in March of 2000.

When we go on trips, I remove one of the captains seats behind the front passenger. Then we have all the space we need, even for long trips. we put our cooler there and we are all set for our trip.

I did have one problem with my vehicle. The fan switch for the air conditioner/heat did not work on the second and first setting. To replace this small part was $400.00 and the first one did not work. This was a computer chip, very expensive. The car shop that put it in said they had problems with the mercury's on this.<br><br>
