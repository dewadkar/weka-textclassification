            I never thought I would own an SUV, but after we got our 2nd dog it was time to get rid of the 2 door car.  Now that I've had it for almost 2 years I will never own anything else.  We use it to pull our boat and to haul the dogs around.  You would never know that the boat is behind us, it tows very well.  I can't tell you how many times the 4WD has come in handy in our Michigan winters.  I feel very confident on the roadways now!  We have the 4 door model and it's more convenient than a 2 door.  I can fit a lot in this truck with the 2 rear seats down.  That is another nice feature, if you do have a person who needs to ride in the back and you have to haul something long; you can do both.  The rear seats are split in two, one side is 2 people wide and the other is one person wide.  I hope you understood that.  It has cup holders for 4 people and there are so many little storage places.  There are also plenty of lights for any part of the interior.  Can you tell I love my truck.  It's worth it's weight in gold as far as I'm concerned.  We have never had any mechanical problems with it what so ever!  The drive is not quite as smooth as a car, but it's not bumpy either.  It's a nice ride I think.
