             My friend once joked that pulling into my driveway was like pulling into a Honda dealership. Between the four drivers that live here, we have four Hondas -- three Accords and one Civic. (We also have a Chrysler Voyager, but we're thinking of buying an Odyssey.) One of the Accords is an 87, and just recently began having problems. It has over 170,000 miles on it. One is a 2001, just bought, and runs like a beauty. The third is mine, a 96, and at four years old, has just over 92,000 miles on it.  For all the problems it's had, it could have been driven off the lot yesterday. 

 The most expensive repair we had to have done to it was when it when in for the 90,000 mile check-up; the timing belt and water pump were replaced, as were the rear brakes. Cost about a thousand dollars. That's the most expensive repair this car's needed in four years. Not bad at all. 

 I wrote a review of the 87 Accord, and the same pretty much applies here: you won't find a more reliable car than a Honda. The cars come with warranties (if you buy them new) but you rarely, if ever, need them. Hondas, especially Accords, will run forever, and if one dies before 200,000 miles, either it was driven into the ground or it got in an accident. 

 It might not be the sportiest car, but it isn't exactly a station wagon. The Accord comes with a four-cylinder engine, but you can upgrade to a V6 for a little extra dough. (That might only be the EX model, I'm not sure.) 

 As I said in my "con" section, the Accord is the #1 stolen car in America. The reason for that is simple: it's the most bought -- and most reliable -- car in America. If that doesn't say enough for you, then nothing else I can say will convince you. And there's plenty you can do to make an Accord sportier: spoiler, bigger engine, paint job, get a coupe, etc. 

 If you're in the market for a used car, the Accord is an especially good buy -- with most used cars, it's hard to know exactly how well the previous owner(s) maintained it, and you can run into some problems very quickly. An Accord is so much more reliable than most other cars that its previous history isn't usually an issue. Unless it was used in the Indy 500 regularly,  chances are it's gonna hold up for a while. A long while. 

 And for those of you who say "Buy American," I will -- just as soon as GM or Ford or Chevy puts out a car that's as reliable and problem-free as the Accord.
