            I personnally own a mustang and if you are thinking about getting a mustang make sure you get a GT.  One good thing about the new style mustangs is they do look very stylish.  These mustangs are not that much different from their last style which came out in 94. If you also like to inhance your stereo system after you get a car I do not recommend getting the Mach system in your new mustang because if you have a Mach system already in there it is harder and more expensive to further inhance your system.  One bad thing about owning a GT is it is more expensive to get parts when something goes wrong.  The tires are also pretty expensive.<br><br>
