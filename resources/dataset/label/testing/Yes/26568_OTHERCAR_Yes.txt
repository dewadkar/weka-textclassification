            In my opinion the Nissan Sentra is one of the best built cars for the value around. It has great gas milage, great standard features, and highly rated saftey features, with an affordable price. The Sentra gives the everyday driver, a safe smooth ride with style.With 4 people in the car there is plenty of room for everyone. I own a '93 Sentra now, and since I have had it, I have only replaced the fuel pump, the car has a total of 75,000 miles on it, and only the fuel pump needed replacements. The repairs for this car are easy, and affordable.When its time to get a new car the Sentra will provide a nice resale value as well. The Sentra will give you many, many miles of driving pleasure, without breaking the bank.<br><br>
