            I have owned a Epson PC-700 now for approximately 11 months. I have enjoyed every minute of using it. The things that I like about it most ranges from its size to the many features that it has. It is not much bigger than the old 110 camera of years ago. It fits perfect in the palm of your hands. It is also equipped with some of the latest technical features such as a viewing screen, preview selection, and even a slide presentation. These are a few of the features that I like. My family loves the fact that with just an adaptor I can plug the camera into our VCR where we can watch the slides on TV. My family and I have really enjoyed our Epson PC-700 camera.<br><br>
