               When you want to take the kids' friends and there are not enough seats, get a van. This van will entertain the kids on any trip, no matter how short a drive. The video setup with remote is a real plus. When we go to the store the kids don't fight or yell. They just watch a Rugrat video. When they get older and we buy them their own set of head phones the media center in the rear allows them to change to a different station on the radio. So while I listen to old foagie music they can listen to current hits. 
   The ride is smoother than the SUV (truck) we traded in and the fuel consumption is nicer to the pocketbook. There is plenty of seats (7) for our childrens friends. And ample space for the T-ball or soccer equipment behind the rear seat. If you need more space for large shopping trips the rear seat folds up and slides forward to accommodate this. Also the mid seat is removable and can allow the rear seat to take its place allowing even more space in the back for large objects.
   It's not shaped like an egg, a bullet or a rocket. It's very cozy inside and there's room to stretch your legs. It does have a slight roll to it when cornering but you don't feel like you'll roll over.
   I admit that I was skeptical about getting a van but have become a fan. Now what to do with the sports car? HA HA<br><br>
