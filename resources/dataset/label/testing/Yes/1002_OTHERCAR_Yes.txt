            First and foremost, this car is <b>Versatile!</b>  It is flexible and gives you room when you need it.  You can easily call it today's version of a station wagon.  They call it a "crossover" vehicle - part car, part suv.  This is true but I'd say it's 70% car / 30% suv (and that's fine).  You definitely sit higher up and get better angle view of the traffic and road ahead, but not nearly as much as an SUV.  Cargo area is great, about as much or even more than smaller size SUV.  Both rear seats easily fold completely flat and even the front passenger seat folds forward 99% flat.  That's a ton of room in just seconds.  Just last week I loaded it up with a dozen 8-foot long landscaping timbers... and I was still able to close the hatch!  Spacious.

It drives very well.  It's not a powerful muscle car but it is peppy.  Handling is very sporty and responsive and it gets good gas mileage.  As I mentioned, you sit a bit higher with a big windshield so the forward view is good.  But the rear and rear-side views are the biggest problems I have with my car.  The rear window is relatively small but acceptable for checking traffic in the mirror.  The bigger problem is sight lines when checking on the rear sides (due to the small windows).  You actually need to concentrate on your viewing when backing out the driveway or looking over your shoulder before changing lanes. Another note on the small rear side windows is that my five year old complains that she can't see well the ground over the high door frame.  Factory tires aren't as good as aqua-tred types so it tends to hydroplane easier.  

Interior is sharp and unique but not always ergonomic.  The dash display is a cool cluster of metallic style circles (happens to prevents your front passenger from seeing how much over the speed limit if you care).   The automatic handle is not on the steering column <i>or</i> the floor, but interestingly centered under the radio.  But on the poor design side, you need to reach over to fiddle with the radio, and when you do there are no physical features that you can feel to distinguish between AM/FM or channel numbers so you'll need to take your eyes off the road for a second.  There&#146s also several radio features that don't actually do anything?  Cup holders are descent (two front and a cool matrix-y double in the rear).  And if you stop to eat and you don't have a passenger, there's a neat 'folding table' on the back of the folded passenger seat.
