            10 years ago I bought my first Mercedes, an E class - it was the end of the model year and the dealer was discounting it heavily, so I bought it.  I had owned all the cars prior to the Mercedes for an average of 2.5 years; my commute over grueling mountain roads simply wore out the cars before their time.  I was hoping my new E would be better as this was proving to be a very expensive commute.  After 150K miles it looked and ran just like it did when it was new - the paint was still deep and gorgeous, no squeaks or rattles and the engine smooth and strong.  After 10 years and 150K miles, though, I wanted a new car.

I bought the E320 after much research - it is certainly not the same Mercedes as my old 300E; the new car has more &quot;stuff&quot;, the V6 that starts off in 1st gear is a LOT more speedy than the old inline-6 and even when the car is moving at a good speed, the V6 seems always to have more to offer.  The interior is softer and more &quot;luxurious&quot; than the 300E and the gadgetry depth feels more Japanese than German - after all the 300E was pretty basic.

The steering is now rack &amp; pinion unlike the old recirculating ball and, to be honest, feels a little excitable sometimes.  The front windshield pillar is thicker than the 300E and reduces the visibility more.  The finish quality is up to the 300E, but some of the components seem of lesser quality.  I preferred the steel sunroof and the external antenna; the rear light bulbs were easier to access and the spare was a full size tire on a real wheel.  The radio feels like it is overly complex; the old radio on the other hand, was underfeatured for the day.

I do like the climate controls A LOT, my young lady and I no longer fuss over the temperature or fan speed - she can set her own and be hot and happy and I can set mine and be cool and happy. The air filter is great on a smoggy day or when following a diesel, the seats are still as good and the rear legroom is excellent for an adult or a kid.  

The locking system is superb and the Tele-Aid system is a great safety feature.  Tele-Aid is a combination of systems based around a dedicated cellular link and GPS sensor.  It will summon emergency personnel should the car deploy its airbags or when the internal SOS button is pressed; the GPS sensor is used to locate the car in such an emergency, it is used when getting human help for directions, for locating the car when stolen and, finally, it offers a means to get help should the car simply run out of gas.

I just hope that after 10 years and 150K miles it will still be as reliable as my old 300E.  I buy my cars to last a long time as this is cheaper and causes less pollution than churning a car every 2.5 years.  If it does last as well as my 300E, then I will be definitely be buying my 3rd Mercedes in 2010.<br><br>
