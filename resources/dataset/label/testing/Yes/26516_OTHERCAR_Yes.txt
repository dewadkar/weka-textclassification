            I bought a used 94 s-10, so far it's been a great truck. It's got a powerful engine, that eats gas a little, but it's great to have a 6cyl 4.3 with a stick. A joy to drive, all my friends who have driven it agree. I have the off road options on it and it looks great. It is a 6 year old truck, but it needs only minor repairs. It's nice being in something that you can drive over curbs in. All the instruments are nicely arranged and easy to see. I did have some trouble putting an aftermarket radio in. The S 10 has very little depth in the radio slot. <br><br>
