            .....I absolutely love the Nissan Murano. <b>It had the best handling, and smoothest ride I've ever felt.</b>I actually liked the orangish exterior and interior. I think it gave my Nissan Murano a unique quality to it, an ecentric style. The interior of the car in my opinion is even more stylish. With a blackish brown wood type look to it. Adding more comfort and ease to my ride in the Nissan Murano.

.....The car is very heavy weighing in at some 4,000 lbs. <b>But the acceleration is tremendous. 0-60 in about 8 seconds.</b>For a 4,000 lbs car thats not too shabby.The Nissan Murano also has an astonishing 245 Horse Power. My Murano does not benefit saving gas. The per tank mileage is pretty weak. I have not had any maintaince problems. Just the usual inspections for a car, nothing unusual.The car usually makes for a pretty smooth ride, I haven't encountered over heating or break downs or any problems of that sort. Which I am very lucky for...


.....Warranty's- 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty, and a 3 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.

Tech Specs

.....The Murano comes with or has the options of, dual zone climate controls (great for when its hot and cold!!!), cup holders which are very handy, basicly power everything, locks,windows,etc. Also audio controls on the steering wheel. I really liked this feature because i think it helped me to pay attention more to the road. Not to lean over and fiddle with the radio and put risk to my life. Also a very handy garage door transmitter. The murano has 6 airbags, cruise control, 3 12v power outlets (very handy for objects that require power in the car, <b>a 6 disc 225 watt Bose Sound System with 7 speakers,</b>power adjustable pedals, roof rails, and power leather seats. The seats are very comfortable. Also you have the option for a power sunroof. 

.....The climate controls really help when its cold out, and hot out. It is a very easy system to use. It works really well by getting the hot air or cold air circulated throughout the car quickly. 

.....The sound system is pretty good. A 7 speaker Bose System produces crystal clear sound. And a 6 CD changer is the best part of the entire sound system. The FM and AM radio is good enough, and gets decent sound. 

.....I have had no problems with the engine or transmission. Oh and one last thing the power outlets are really handy for computers and gameboys for the kids. The Murano can seat 5 adults which is OK for a car of its type.I also forgot to mention that I have powerful 4-wheel drive on my Murano. Which helps in snowstorms, especially around Christmas time!

Bottom Line-
.....This is a very comfortable luxury car. It has all the needed extras (cup holders, power windows, climate control etc.) But it is pretty pricy. Ranging from $27,000-$31,000.  I don't know cars too well, but I liked this one. It was easy to use, comfortable, and ran smoothly. From driver to driver, I think the Nissan Murano's best quality is it's handling.
