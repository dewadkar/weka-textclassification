            We recently purchased a 2000 Grand Cherokee Laredo - what a great move!  It has such a powerful but smooth ride.  Once my wife and I test-drove this car, we knew it was the one.

We first drove the Dodge Durango, but it was just too big and had such a stiff ride.  We did like the price, as compared to the Grand Cherokee, but it just wasn't worth it.  We also rented the Chevy Blazer which also had a nice ride and came in a close second.

Thinking later about the Grand Cherokee purchase, we decided that we should have spent the extra $5k for the Limited package.  The most important feature is the switch that remembers seat and mirror settings for two different drivers.  Since my wife and I are different sizes, when we alternate driving, having a switch to remember settings would make things much easier.

We have almost 3,000 miles and are about to take it in for its oil change and have had no problems at all.

One of the very few downsides to this vehicle is the entry into the backseats.  The inside section of the door jam can get dirty and when one climbs into the back seat, because of the angle of the door entry it is easy to get dirty.

Who should buy this vehicle?.....anyone looking for a sharp, quality built and all-around fantastic vehicle.<br><br>
