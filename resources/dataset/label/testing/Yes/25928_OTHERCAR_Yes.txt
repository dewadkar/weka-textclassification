            My first Grand Am was a 1996 two-door.  The car itself handled very nice and was fun to drive.  During the first year, I had to have two different sets of brakes put on the car because of part failure.  After having the car two years, I traded it in for a 1999 Grand Am GT.

My car is fun, fast, and the perfect size.  However, it too has had many problems with the brakes.  After 12,000 miles the brakes went out and were replaced under warranty.  In June of this year and after 28,000 my second set of brakes went out.  These were not covered under warranty and cost me close to $200.  Three month's later in September of this year and 32,000 miles, my third set of brakes went out.  The dealership covered the cost of having these replaced.

I asked the dealership what the problem was, and they said that Pontiac Grand Am's have a known brake defect.

Well, here we are in November, and guess what.  Although the brakes haven't gone completely out, the grinding noise is once again starting.

I love my car, but as you can see, I've had a tremendous problem with faulty brakes.<br><br>
