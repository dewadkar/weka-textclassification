            <b>Preamble</b>
Who here is surprised that I am a spoiled brat?  :)

I have wanted a Honda CR-V for at least a year.  Every time I'd see one on the road, I would stare at it longingly like a piece of chocolate :).  But see, in the past, I was the type of person to spend bare bones money on cars.  Either I bought used cars or I bought cars with none of those swell extras in them.

This time around, I decided to splurge <i>gulp</i>.  And the timing - couldn't have been any worse.  I had one month to go on my contract for my job, several leads for future positions but no "for sures" and I wanted to do some remodeling in our house.

My friend Donna told me to take on the attitude of, <i>Sometimes you just gotta say...what the f*uck</i>.  So I did :).

<b>Why Honda</b>
My very first car was a used, 1978 red honda.  I bought it for $1995 in 1986.  It had 90 some odd thousand miles on it and it had a manual transmission.  

That car was a mean machine.  It started in some of the coldest days of Northern Indiana (as opposed to my friends brand new American cars).  I never got stuck in the snow and the gas mileage was incredible (38 miles to the gallon).  Ah!  The days of being poor :).

When I moved up a little in the world, I purchased a brand new Ford Mustang (1988).  That entire lemon-like experience convinced me that I had made the worst decision of my short purchasing life.  After dumping my Ford Mustang, I went running back to Honda with my tail between my legs.

Since my Ford experience, I have had two other Honda's - a 2 door Honda Civic hatchback and a 4 door Honda Civic sedan.

I have never, EVER had an issue with any Honda that I have ever owned.  On top of that, no matter what Honda dealership I visit (and for whatever reason), I'm always treated very well.  Stuff like this makes a big difference with me.

<b>My First Impressions of The Honda CRV EX</b>
I special ordered my CRV from Honda's web site.  I wanted to be able to order everything that *I* wanted without having to take additional accessories on (or risk not getting something that I really wanted).  That's what sometimes happens when you purchase off of a lot.  My vehicle took approximately 4 weeks to arrive.  Those were 4 long weeks for me!

<i>Ooooh!</i>  When I got up close to a Honda CRV, there wasn't much that I didn't fall in love with.

The outside body shape looked sleek but natural.  I loved the rounded-ness of the front and the curvature of the back.  I loved that from the outside point of view, the CRV looked like a compact (not too big, not too small) mean machine.  The color I chose was some sort of a dark blue (midnight blue perhaps?) and I was just blown away at how pretty the color was on this vehicle.

I made sure to add body side cladding to my CRV.  Why?  Because every other car I have owned seems to get banged up and have chips of paint missing from people who open their car doors to close to my vehicle.  I realize that most people don't do this on purpose so in my mind, I was insuring my peace of mind against their stupidity when I got the cladding added.

The inside had me drooling.  You see, little things mean a lot to me.

The front bucket seats were comfortable for my wide bee-hind area.  At 5'9", I had plenty of head room and certainly, plenty of leg space.

One of the issues I had with past vehicles is that I never had enough cup holders.  With the CRV, I had three conveniently tucked away cup holders in the front, and two in the back.  And speaking of tucked away, between the driver and passenger seats is a collapsable tray table.  I love it!  When it's collapsed and I can put my big ole bulky purse there and I don't have to worry about stepping on it.

I'm probably the only person in the world that cares a lot about floor mats.  I hate floor mats.  I mean, they're a necessary evil however, they can make your car look really trashy.  I loved how these were full size mats that were snapped on to the floor.  That way, your feet wouldn't be kicking them around.

The stereo was every thing I've wanted in a car since I was 18.  Adding a subwoofer and a tweeter made me feel 18 again :).  The thumping, the volume and clear quality convinced me that I had made a wise decision in getting that option added on.

I wondered how people sitting in the back seat would feel.  The Honda CRV isn't huge like say - a van is huge and really, I bought this vehicle for ME ME ME however, I do care about the comfort of other people riding with me.  The passengers in the back have some decent leg and head space.  I've ridden in the back and have had no issue with comfort.

I almost want to giggle when I tell you that one of my very favorite parts of the CRV is the back area.  It's huge!  The back door pulls out to the right and in the back, there are some nicely hidden away compartments where you can store things like ice scrapers, gloves, and other miscellaneous stuff.  Because the spare is mounted on the back of that door, the entire back area is free from large items that get in the way of - oh say - storing your latest shopping spree :).

<b>What's Happened Over The Past Four Months?</b>
I still love driving my Honda CRV.  Although not as quiet as our 2002 Toyota Camry, it drives smoothly, especially on highway road trips.

I've gotten quite used to all of the extra features that I've added.  The moonroof slides back even when it's only 40 degrees because it's essential for me to crank that stereo up and sing at the top of my lungs with the wind blowing somewhere :).

The seats are comfortable and I'm thrilled that I got leather instead of cloth.  It makes cleaning so much easier and my allergies are thanking me for not adding more dust to the mix.

I have gotten quite a bit of use out of my back cargo area.  It used to be that I couldn't haul much in my other passenger cars.  Here, I can shop and shop and shop and not worry about running out of space.  Sure, it'll happen eventually however, the eventually part has been elongated :).

The addition of the body side cladding has been one of the best decisions I have made.  I have been in spots (you know, people come AFTER me) where my vehicle would have otherwise probably been dinged.  It hasn't.  Ah!  Protection at its finest!

Besides that hefty car payment my only real beef is with the gas mileage.  I wish that Honda was able to make a CRV that got 35 miles to the gallon.  Then I think, my life would be perfect :).

<b>The End</b>
Who is the perfect owner for this type of vehicle?  I'd say anyone who likes the comfort and drivability of a mid-sized passenger car BUT wants to take it up another notch.  Oh yes, you need to be hip too :).
