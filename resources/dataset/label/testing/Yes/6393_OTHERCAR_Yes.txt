             In deciding on my purchase of a used vehicle under $5000, I wanted the most vehicle for my money. After driving many cars, or otherwise known as steel cages for many years, I decided that they were limited in their usefulness. I wanted a vehicle that would not only be used for the daily commute to work but, an all purpose vehicle that could accomodate me for both recreational and utility purposes.

  So it was time to test drive the many brands of vehicles in both the SUV and minivan class. Vehicles such as Dodge Caravan, Suzuki Sidekick, Ford Bronco, and Jeep Cherokee to name a few. Several factors were involved in deciding which vehicle would best suit my family. 

Affordability, reliability, and usefulness were some of the contributing factors in purchasing a used vehicle. 
  
 Although the Suzuki Sidekick, Jeep Cherokee, and Ford Bronco are popular SUV class vehicles they lacked in cargo room. For example, It was difficult to find these vehicles useful for moving a washer and dryer or for packing the family camping equipment without leaving the back hatch open. The Jeep Cherokee was very difficult to find in the same price range for the same model year as the Pontiac Transport and was ruled out as a consideration. 

 Checking the web for consumer reports and reliability factors proved useful in determining recalls and lemon check information. However,I found the research to be conflicting at times. According to some consumer reports, Dodge Caravan was plagued by transmission and computer electrical problems. I have also researched consumer reports that indicate the Dodge Caravan as the best minivan in it's class and had been awarded prizes and endorsements. So with the conflicting information provided to me I decided to test drive Dodge Caravan for myself. When test driving the Dodge Caravan I found many of them in the 1990 - 1994 model years appeared to have had head gasket leaks, engine service lights that remained on all the time, and brake trouble. Corrosion appears to be a problem with the sliding side door area. It would appear that after test driving several Dodge Caravans that many of them required expensive computer, brake, or engine repairs.   

 Unlike Dodge Caravan, Pontiac Transport boasted a powerful 3.8 liter fuel injected V6 engine. Many, not all, Dodge Caravans and Suzuki Sidekicks were designed with a four cylinder engine that lacked &quot;hauling&quot; ability. Even the optional V6 engine of Dodge Caravan fell short in the minivan class and not all of them had fuel injection. This lack of power causes stress on the engine which explains all the engine gasket leaks I encountered. The Pontiac Transports 3800 V6 engine is rated very high among design engineers at General Motors. The engine is also used in the Lumina production line.  The Lumina was highly rated as number 1 production car in quality at the Oshawa, Ontario production plant by consumer reports in past production years. I provided the dealership with the vehicle identification number and my research indicated that the Pontiac Transport did not have any recalls.
 
 Although ABS brake technology is incorporated as standard in the Pontiac Transport, I would prefer a model that didn't have an array of brake sensors and computer detection equipment because it would add to the costs of repairing them.

 The body of the vehicle is entirely made of fiberglass. This is good protection against corrosion, and the lightweight of the fiberglass contributes to increased fuel economy. Fuel economy is very good for this class of vehicle. If you intend to mount a C.B. radio magnetic mount antenna for road information when travelling, you will find the magnet doesn't stick anywhere on the vehicle.

 Using the keyless entry remote control on the key chain, I advanced into this space shuttle designed vehicle. The power seat provided comfort but it is difficult to get at the controls at the bottom of the seat. The combination of tilt steering and power seats made it possible to put the seat back and maintain good control of the steering wheel. The dashboard controls are easy to understand and light up extremely well at night. There is a slide control to &quot;tone down&quot; the brightness. Driver and passenger side &quot;Kangaroo&quot; style pockets can accomodate a small library of road atlases and maps. Turning the key reveals a complete systems analysis on the dashboard similar to the dashboard of the ships on the star trek series. Shifting the transmission into driving range was smooth and tight and revealed no noise or clunky feel. Unlike a sportscar, in the city a minivan handles corners rather like a side swaying school bus. Side sway when lane changing was fair depending on how fast you changed lanes. In highway conditions, there was noticeable road noise. There was a blind spot on the rear left side of the vehicle that made it manditory to look behind before changing lanes. The front windshield provided an excellent peripheral view. I would recommend the installation of good quality quiet touring tires and a good blind spot mirror. Although this vehicle isn't designed for 4X4 activities, the suspension ground clearance is better than some SUV's that I passed on the highway. Most SUV rear wheel drive or 4x4 transmissions hang low to the ground at the back. The front wheel drive transmission of the Pontiac Transport not only eliminates ground clearance problems but also provides excellent traction in snow covered conditions. 

 The seats are easily removed with latches and the seats stack up for easy storage.  The vehicle is clearly designed to accomodate travellers and campers alike. You can enjoy comfort even when the seats are removed.  Such things as overhead rear light switches, cup holders, storage trays, pop open windows, built in air inflation compressor, rear air conditioning vents, clothing storage nets behind the front seats, and rear side storage compartments, makes this vehicle into an instant travelling companion without the need to pitch up a tent.
 
 People that only require one vehicle, a vehicle to accomodate you if you have to move mom's washer and dryer from point A-B, a vehicle you like to travel long distances reliably and comfortably in, and you are looking for an all purpose used vehicle that is priced under $5000, you should seriously consider the 1992 Pontiac Transport SE.
