            I love cool cars as much as the next person, don't get me wrong.

I've driven a Maserati bi-turbo, an early 4 speed Golf GTI, a Buick station wagon, a Passat wagon, and various cars in between. But I was extremely happy with my 1997 Toyota Corolla CE, which I bought used when I moved to Los Angeles, and recently lost to a rear-ender, much to my true dismay...

You have no idea how much I miss that car! The car that I wasn't too head over heels with in the first place, but whom I had grown to love fondly, like a family member. This may sound silly, but now as I am actively looking for a replacement (what a bloody pain...), every time I see a Corolla, I look upon it fondly, with love, and think, lucky owner, they have it good.

Really.

There is something very nice about owning a car which does exactly what it is supposed to do. No surprises. 
I purchased the car from a dealer recommended by a friend, and he was wonderful. I'd trust him with my life. 

If you are in Los Angeles and are having trouble finding a car, email me. Never mind, here's their info: AUTO BANCOR, tel 805 496-4141.

No, I have no interest in this, I just sympathise with the trauma of finding a good car...

So I bought the car at the beginning of 2000, and the Corolla was a 1997 (so you have to figure it's really a '96), with 43,000 miles, a known history, 1 or 2 owners, in perfect condition. See that kinda of car is worth the $500 fee to my guy, at least, he also handled all the other incidentals.

It was a 4 door, automatic, white, the CE version.

It was easy to drive, a nice simple dash, ran smoothly and held its own in traffic, easy to park, good mover, quite zippy. The only handling complaint I had is that the acceleration is kinda pedantic, especially up the hills in Malibu. Still, I was not expecting a muscle car.

Very pleasant both in stop and start traffic and doing 70 on the freeway. No noises, no surprises, just a solid, solid ride. I replaced the relatively decent tape deck/radio with a CD player, and I had the regular oil changes, and that was all I ever had to do with the car, for almost 2 years, til I had the misfortune of being hit from behind.

The car is really fabulous on gas, $15 filled up the tank, pretty much, and I always put the lowest grade in, without any complaints from the car. My driving was moderate, I put maybe 9000 miles a year on it, all of it local.

The inside was functional, good cup holders, a good ashtray, which I didn't use, a roomy storage bin in the middle, good door storage places, a large glove compartment , and plenty of room in the trunk. The only problem is that it's not a car you can take to a yard sale and spontaneously come home with a sofa, still, the seats were very moveable, so that you could fit in an object larger than you would expect in the main compartment.

My only real gripes were the fact that I was always having to re-arrange the rear-view mirrors, they never seemed to be really perfect, and the fact that the seats are not at a great angle for lumbar support.

The air conditioning was super duper, and the regular fan air was good, too.

Over all, those are such minor complaints, that I would strongly recommend this car to anyone who wants a hassle free car. They hold their value tremendously.
If I could find a car like it today at a price i can afford, I'd definitely get one again.

Oh, and it's a great car for insurance premiums, it's got a pretty low rate factor.

Great car. I even like the Toyota logo, it's very subtle.
Now was I this happy just because I got a really good car, or because, in general, Toyota Corollas are good cars?

Hmmm... I read all the opinions on this site, and gee whiz, everyone else seems to agree.
Ok, so the music is much better in the Mitsubishi ads, 'tis true, but give me a Toyota corolla and a Massive Attack CD, and I'm set to go.

Since I wrote this opinion, I went back to the friendly folks at Auto Bancor, and leased another Toyota, this time a rockin' Camry, which I shall opine on after I enjoy it for a while!...
