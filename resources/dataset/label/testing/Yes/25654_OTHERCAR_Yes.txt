            I was in the market for a midsized station wagin to replace my trusty 95 Honda Accord LX wagon that was destroyed in an accident on Dec 28th. I Test drove the SUbaru Legacy wagon and noted that the design was identical to the pre Outback version I drove back in 95. While interesting it was pricey and a bit backward in design after 10 years in production. I also drove, a number of times a Honda CR-v EX. 

I was impressed with the overall efficiency of the Honda, but not the road noise (quite high, the interior design (a bit on the econobox level for feel and quality , namely the door arm rests, which were horrid. While I do not really need 4wd I dod  not care ofr the base LX 2 wd for a number of reasons. 

On reccomendation of our credit unions buyer, I test drove a 4 cyl Toyota Highlander. It was a short drive but I was and still am impressed. THe 4 cyl has plenty of grunt, much more than my 5 speed Accord, which had t be wound out a lot to get it to move. The fit and finish was excellent and were the interior materials. THe stereo sounds fine and the size in the back seat is fantastic, much better that the CRv.

I negotiated a good deal $22700 for a 4 cyl 2 wd with the quick order package, the prefferred option package and the mat package. I do not get the trailer package due to the high cost. List was $25700. in Los Angeles. I did not drive the 6 cyl since I could not bring myself to putting up with poor fuel consumption or the cost of premium fuel.

3 tanks of gas later: 24 to 26 mpg in Los Angeles Commutting mixed with low altitude moutain driving. Trottle response is excellent with plenty of low end grunt. Highway passing is fine empty but I think that this vehicle loaded may require some serious time in the right lane of Tejon and Cajon pases if towing much at all.

Road noise is noticeble but not irrritating. The trans shifts extremely smoothly with no suprises at all. THe 4 cyl exhibits no vibration or harshness. Stereo controls are easy to use, unlike the Saturn or the Pontiac Vibe. The Seats are firm but suprisingly comfortable. The driving position is fine, and I am 6'1" tall. The rear seat roon is "two thumbs up" from my 6' 2" (14 y/o) son, who loves the reclining seat back. 

Cargo space is commendable, and the touch in the cargo area are welcome. Such as the grocery bag hooks, the handy cargo net, the lettle cubbies where I keep my binoculares and bird books.

The exterior is a bit conservatively styled. BUt since I rather dislike the "MAD MAX" style suv cladding as seen on the CRV, Avalanche et.al. I am happy with it. After all I do not like attention from the police.

As an sensible SUV , I found this vehicle hard to beat. Good Fuel consumption, great quality, good features, plenty of space and adequate power. Basically a good station wagon alternative.
