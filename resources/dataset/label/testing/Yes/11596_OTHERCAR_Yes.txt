            I purchased a 1999 Rodeo LX in May 0f 99.  It is our second one in 4 years.  The previous one was involved in a low speed accident and the front end folded like a tin can and the air bag did not deploy.  However we still purchased a new one in May, 99.  The new one had alot of new features that sold us.  The split rear seat is a simple way to cart longer than normal items without losing the entire seat.  I just wish there was a hook for a child seat tether strap on the rear floorboard for better securing. With the 15&quot; tires the spare is mounted under the chasis which drastically improves your rear vision.  The new dash layout is user friendly and controls are clear and large.  Pick up is great for a 6 cyl. SUV, gas mileage is not that great.  I have found out that i get better gas mileage on regular gas instead of Super.
 All in all it is a great truck for the money.  It handles well on and off road, the push button 4 wheel drive is clear and simple to operate. The seats are comfy and sound system is above average.  I would recommend this truck for the mid size family looking for an affordable SUV.<br><br>
