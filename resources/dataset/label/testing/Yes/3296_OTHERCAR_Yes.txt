            INTRODUCTION
When I was in the market for a car, I was looking very closely at the Lexus ES300 and BMW 3-Series.  One day, I saw a Millenia for sale at a local dealership and it immediately caught my eye.  The unique style was the best I have ever seen.  The front headlights are like diamonds and the tail lights are perfectly curved.  When I looked inside, I made up my mind that this was the car I wanted.  I instantly forgot about the Lexus and the BMW.

EXTERIOR
When I am out driving, I always get people's attention with my car's looks.  The Millenia has the best curves and style.  Everything complements each other.  The front headlights look as if they are made of diamonds and since they are projector type headlights, they make visibility no problem at all.  The chrome grill gives the whole car a luxurious look that will never fade.  And, the tail lights are perfectly designed to fir the car's style.

INTERIOR
When you sit inside the Millenia, you won't want to sit in any other car again.  The BOSE stereo is so powerful and rich in sound that you will feel as if you are at a concert.  The dual power seats give such a distinct adjustment that no other car can give.  When the key is inserted, the steering wheel moves down to the programmed position.  Likewise, when you remove the key, the steering wheel moves up so you can easily get out.  The heated seats work very rapidly.  The climate control is very easy to work and will give you a range in temperature in your car from 60F-90F.  Every other control in the vehicle(power windows, power locks, alarm, cruise control, trunk and gas buttons, and traction control) is easy to use and provides fantastic performance. 
 
PERFORMANCE
The Millenia provides excellent acceleration.  The "hold" button located on the shifter knob, only available in the Millenia, gives an extremely powerful boost of speed especially when activated around the speed of 60+.  When the button is pressed, the rpm will be pushed to the max while providing fast acceleration.  The ride is one of the most quiet and smooth, I always receive compliments on them.  The engine, in my opinion, is the most quiet available.  Sometimes, I can't even tell if my car is started or not.  Once you purchase your Millenia, it will seem new throughout time.  The Millenia is a timeless car!
