            I've owned this vehicle for two months now, and I could not be happier.  This was my first new car purchase in 11 years (yes, I'm a tightwad), and I did a tremendous amount of research before making a purchase.  The TL looks great (though beauty is obviously in the eye of the beholder), and it drives like a dream.  In particular, I have been amazed at its handling on the ice and heavy snow we have recently experienced here in Chicago.  Traction and driver control have been outstanding.  
  What sold me on the TL was its value for the money.  The car offers almost no options, with virtually every conceivable &quot;extra&quot; included standard.  Moreover, the pricing is fabulous: comparably equipped vehicles, even when aggressively discounted, cost thousands more than the Acura.  
  The ride in this car has been smooth and comfortable, and all systems have functioned flawlessly.  My two quibbles have been with (a) the windshield wipers - I don't think the do a great job, and (b) the trunk pass-through (I think they could have done something more than a small hole to the back seat, suitable only for skis or narrow poles).  Other than that, the car is top-notch. The standard stereo system has been a delight, the seat warmers have kept me comfy on recent below freezing days, and the appointments are truly luxurious.  My gas mileage has not been great, but that may improve after the first few months.  Also, I do little highway driving, and lots of local street driving, which hurts efficiency.  Also, I hate paying for premium gas, but that seems to be a uniform requirement with all comparable luxury cars.
  As a final point, I must say that my satisfaction with the car has been reinforced due to my satisfaction with the dealer.  This purchase entailed one of the most gratifying transactional experiences I have encountered - the dealership was beyond anything I could have anticipated.  Starting off on the right foot with a dealer can make a world of difference.
  If you are thinking about buying this car, go for it.  You will have made a prudent and pleasing decision.<br><br>
