            I own 2 Sephia's a 1996 bought 10 months old and a 1999 bought new. I would certainly recommend them to friend. The service by 3 dealers in my area has been good on all occasions with one providing car washes after service or repair. I was treated fairly by the sales staff (usual haggling - which for me is part of the fun) and the service departments seem to fall over themselves in an effort to meet the terms of the warranty. This takes the dread out of having to call for an appt. to schedule a service - well done Kia.
The 1996 now has now covered more than 45,000 miles and runs great, the three speed transmission seems to be a little more responsive than the four speed on the 1999. I have had no running expenses other than routine maintenance - plus tires and battery. By the way, a criticism coming, the new Firestone tires I had fitted gave the car a completely new feel - they need to do something about those &quot;Hangkooks....&quot; that the car is supplied with. 
If you're in the market to buy this type of transport I can't see why you would want to lay out the extra $'s for similar sized vehicles from other manufacturers. Compact cars are what they are and providing they can offer trouble free transport with a respectable degree of comfort (a/c in Florida..!!) let the price tag be the decider<br><br>
