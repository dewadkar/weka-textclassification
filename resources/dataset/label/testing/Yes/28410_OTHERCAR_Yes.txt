            When I became pregnant in 98 my husband and I soon realized that we would have to trade in my little sports car convertible and find something safer with more room. I had always purchased Hondas and was reluctant to try a Nissan. But I have been so pleasantly satisfied. I have a forest green Nissan Maxima GLE and not only is it Fast, but there is so much leg room in front and back. With the GLE package you get the leather interior which is so great when you have a one year old that will throw her grape juice down. It is so easy to clean and absolutely shows no wear or tear! The trunk is also one of the roomiest I have seen. I can fit two strollers and about 6 full bags without a problem. Even the stereo is top of the line. It comes with a Bose stereo and speakers...better than in my husbands car, just perfect for those Barney tapes. As you can tell I love my car and highly recommend a test drive. <br><br>
