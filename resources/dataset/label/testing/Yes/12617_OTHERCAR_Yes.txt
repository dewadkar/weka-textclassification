               This camera has features of cameras much larger and more expensive.  My first impression of this camera was &quot;Wow, it looks and feels just like the Elph.&quot;  If I were in the market to buy a compact digital camera, this would definately be the one.

   The S10 is a very beautiful machine.  It is the smallest 2 megapixel camera out there, but it takes pictures just like the big beasts.  Here are the major positive and negative issues which I think you should know

My major complaint with this is the LCD screen.  It says it is 1.8 inch, but it seems so incredebly small.

Here is the bottom line:  If you want excellent photo quality with control, get either a coolpix 950, a Olympus 2020Z (or 2000Z), or a Kodak DC290.  All of these models take exceptional photos.  The coolpix 950 is the most popular of this bunch, and if you like accessories such as extreme telephoto lenses, wide angle, and fish eye, than this is your choice.  If you love the compact, get this camera.
