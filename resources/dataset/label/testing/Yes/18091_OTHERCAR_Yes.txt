            I have watch the Neon market for a few years. I purchased a 1996 Neon in October, when I bought this car I was just looking for a cheap car to drive to and from work. This car turned out to be the right one. The average gas mileage for this car is between 34 and 37 mpg. This car gives a good ride and is comfortable. 

The car I purchased had a considerable amount of surface damage to the body. But, it was cheap enough and I figured what the heck it was just a work car. Now I am considering having the car repaired as it has become almost as popular as the family car. These are great cars and will make a good car for anyone. If you're going out to find a car test drive a Neon, see if you don't like this great car.
