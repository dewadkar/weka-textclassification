            Having the <b>Canon Powershot S100 Digital ELPH</b> in my hands is just like having a wish-granting elf around to create the clearest, sharpest, and easiest digital photos imaginable. 

With it's tiny but powerful built-in telephoto lens, the camera is easy to manipulate and takes great pictures whether close-up or at a distance.  I was at a party recently where the new toy of the evening was the <b>S100 Digital ELPH</b> and I have to say that, for the price, it is the best digital camera I have seen to date.

A tiny piece of electronics measuring only 3.4&quot; x 2.2&quot; x 1.1&quot;, this camera weighs less than seven ounces and the buttons are few and easy to locate and learn.  The kit contains the 2.1 Mpixel Canon PowerShot S100 camera, 8Mb CompactFlash card, wrist strap, USB cable, video out cable, software (including Canon Digital Camera Solutions and Adobe PhotoDeluxe), rechargeable lithium-ion battery w/charger, and easy to follow manuals for both the camera and software.  

We took some dark campfire photos at the party using the flash and the clarity was astounding.  On the LCD screen, the photos were crisp and clear and when emailed out to the party guests, everyone was very pleased with the pictures.  There was no flash glare.

The batteries allow for about 50 photos (LCD on) including download time.  Canon claims 85 with LCD on and over 250 with LCD off but having the LCD on permits the photographer to see the photos as he or she takes them and delete right then whichever ones are not to their liking.  Recharging is a breeze and the camera is small enough to fit into a front shirt pocket or small handbag or waistpack.  There is also a built-in lens cover and optical viewfinder however be prepared to leave smudges from your nose on the LCD screen when taking photos.  

If you are looking for the best compact digital camera available now, the <b>Canon Powershot S100 Digital ELPH</b> is the camera for you and your family.  Makes a great Christmas or birthday gift, too, for those hard-to-please bosses or the person who has <i>almost</i> everything.
