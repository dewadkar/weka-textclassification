            My father has owned four Volvo 240s in his lifetime, 2 of which I have had the pleasure of driving. These cars are famed for their longevity and durability, making them a great choice for those in the used-car market. After clocking 325,000 kilometers on our '85 240 DL, we had to retire it due to under-body rust. However, the engine and drivetrain were still mechanically sound. In 1999 we replaced it with an '83 240 GLT with 256,000 kilometers. Since then we've clocked over 20,000 kilometers on it and have had no problems. This car is the family workhorse, and is driven on construction sites daily (where only trucks and SUVs dare venture).

Under the hood, the GLT features Volvo's venerable in-line four, but the fuel-injector, camshaft, and compression ratio are tweaked to provide more horsepower and torque. The &quot;T&quot; in its name stands for touring edition, which is distinguished by sleeker trim on the exterior, an all-leather interior, extra gauges on the dash, and a smaller, responsive steering wheel. In later models, the &quot;T&quot; denotes turbo. While these features combine to give the GLT a sportier feel, the car can't shake off the tank reputation.

Despite the car's age, it still provides good acceleration at high and low speeds, and can challenge new cars in traffic. The car's handling is precise, the steering isn't overly mushy, and the ride is fairly smooth. The brakes are incredibly powerful, as 4 wheel-discs are the norm on 240s, and the rotors are big enough to stop a truck. I've driven both manual and automatic transmission 240s, and I do prefer the manual for its smooth shifter and fuel efficiency, but the automatic is responsive and reliable. 

However, like most other 240s, the car tends to tilt excessively as it corners, although I suspect that the car is much to heavy to actually roll over. The car will squeak and rattle at different speeds. My automatic transmission lacks an overdrive, and although the engine is smooth and peppy at high revs, it gulps gas on freeways. The 240s are as tough as nails and rarely break down, but servicing can be expensive if you insist on new parts. From my experience, rust will claim Volvos while they still have a lot of life left in them, although I live in Canada, where we salt our roads in the winter.

I would recommend the 240 to anyone requiring a durable and reliable car. This car will save your life in an accident. Even the seats have been known to save a passengers' life from a car bomb. It is a great car for teenagers and college students who need a cheap car and can't afford to put up with break-downs. Don't be afraid to get one with high mileage as long as it has a four-cylinder engine and minimal body rust.
