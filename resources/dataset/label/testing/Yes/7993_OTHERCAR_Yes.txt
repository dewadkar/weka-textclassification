            I needed a nice riding safe car with enough room for 4 adults, 5 in a bind.  The car offered a great overal package and I liked the looks.  I love the seats, the wonderful stereo, the fit and finish, the looks, and the safety.  Its a joy to drive.  It has plenty of power, its not too flash.  The interior is well put together.  The interior is huge.  Compare it to any large sedan and you will see.  On the outside its small relatively small.  Rear seat comfort rivals any sedan ive ever been in.  The volvo rides nicely and is relatively quiet.  You're not going to mistake it for a corvette but its a good balance.  The engine pulls nicely through all the gears.  If you want to be able to drag your neighbors mustang you better opt for the twin turbo T-6.  For my purposes that was a bit overkill.  The steering is light... some would complain but to me it feels like the car drives itself.  Safety was a big concern when purchasing this car.  It has plenty of airbags and a very solid structure.  The brakes are awesome.. a but touchy at first but they sure do stop the car well enough.  I mentioned the stereo.  If you opt for the more expensive stereo watch out.  This system puts out more bass then any other car system I have experienced.  Its a great system. If you are looking for a true sports sedan stay away from this car.  If you want a value with some sport and plenty of room this is the car for you.  Everything you expect from a Volvo and a lot you dont expect from a volvo.  The handling could be a bit tighter, the appearance, a bit sportier... but why, its not a BMW.  If you have kids and need something safe or want a personal luxury car thats easy to drive and can carry 4 people consider this car<br><br>
