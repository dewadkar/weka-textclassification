            My 1994 Chrysler Town &amp; Country van was such a wonderful investment.  I have been pleased with how great of a vehicle that it has turned out to be.  I purchased it used, but with only 24,000 miles on it, so it was like new.  

The interior of the car is so roomy with very comfortable seats.  It came stock with a Cassette/CD player with great sounding speakers. (Infinity)  The dash is accented with a nice wooden touch that adds class to the interior.  There are also many windows giving excellent vision out of the vehicle, and virtually no blind spots. There is also the advanced looking headboard device, that tells you from MPG, to what direction and the temperature outside; among other things it displays.  This comes in handy for road trips if you want to check mileage or see what direction you are headed.

The exterior is also classy, with the newer curved look versus older, blockier style vans.  It also has the handy dual sliding doors on each side which made loading and unloading of people in the back very easy.  There is also a big hatch in the rear that gives ample storage area.

This is probably one of the best mini-vans out on the market today.  You will not be disappointed with this vehicle.<br><br>
