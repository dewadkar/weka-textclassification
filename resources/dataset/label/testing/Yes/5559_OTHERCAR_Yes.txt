            I lease a Lexus GS 300, but I normally get an RX 300 for a loaner car.  The RX's that they have are the 2001 model, and I thought I would offer my opinions.

First, the overall design.  The car is pleasant to look at both on the inside and out.  It has a pleasant appeal, and is one of the better looking Lexus models.  The interior design is also nice looking, pretty good quality materials throughout, and a wooden steering wheel and shift knob are very nice touches.  Compared to the competition, Lexus has the warm and fuzzy feeling down pat.

Overall ride quality is excellent.  Many other sport-utes (or whatever the manufacturer wants to call them) provide a very rough ride.  While it can't beat the ride of a luxury sedan, it is very smooth overall.  I found the powertrain to be a little bit rough, but once again, compared to Lexus standards.  Compared to the Benz ML that I have driven, this car is light years ahead in terms of refinement and smoothness.  Supplementing the ride is downright comfy seats.  Yourself and your passengers will be very comfortable.

Power from the 6 cylinder engine is pretty good.  Better than a lot of other sport-utes I have driven, and is certainly much quieter.  In this regard, performs better.  How this engine performance will stack up in adverse conditions is anyones guess, but who will take an RX off-road?

Handling is a little bit ponderous.  Not as much as say a Land Rover Discovery, but not up to car standards, and not up to the standards of its competitors.  Although, I don't expect the RX to be driven hard.  Coming from a car in to this is a little bit of a shock, and requires a change in driving habits.  This is not the case in the Benz ML that I have driven.

Interior ergonomics are a little bit off in this vehicle.  Many of the buttons for the radio and HVAC controls are small and hard to tell apart from one another.  The screen that displays all of the information about the stereo and HVAC is nicely laid out, but easily gets drowned out in even low amounts of sunlight.  The center console is also a little shoddy.  But, the vacu-flourescent gauges are a joy to look at in any light level, and the high mounted shift knob fits well in this vehicle.

The stereo is also average for a Lexus.  Way too bassy, even though it can't keep up.  In dash 6 disc, interchangeable with other Lexus's is a major plus.  Controls for some of the basic functions are a little bit hard to find and use.

With only 5000 miles on the odometer, this RX also had a lot of interior noises.  Once again, not much more or less than others in this class, but more than in other Lexus's.

Many of my comparisons in this review concentrate on comparing standard sedans to this sport-ute.  And the reason is very simple:  the RX is really a car.  It feels like an ES, which it is based on, just a little bit higher and with more room.  That is not a bad thing, but why get this, when you can actually get a standard sedan?  Sure, the room is much greater, and the supposed benefits during snow storms would be great.  But, I have not experienced this car in the snow, and I expect, seeing the standard car "touring" tires that the RX has on it, that even with the all wheel drive system, it won't be running rings around the other sport-utes that concentrate on more of the utility of it all.  And, with no low range, this is a very basic all wheel drive system.

The verdict:  As my title states, this is a great boulevard cruiser.  My inclination is that most of the people that think that they need a sport-ute actually don't need one at all, and would do much better with a typical luxury car, particularly the new Lexus ES.  This is Lexus's best selling model.  It is a friendly package, and as long as you don't expect a lot more than a nice ride, you will be pleasantly surprised.  If you are like me, you would be more suited to one of the competitors, such as a BMW X5 (although more expensive) or an Acura MDX.  Or just get a regular car.  Or, if you need extra space, try a BMW 3 series wagon, or an Audi Allroad Quatro.
