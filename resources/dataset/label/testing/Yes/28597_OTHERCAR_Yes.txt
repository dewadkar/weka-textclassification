            I LOVE WRANGLERS! These cars, though not necessarily the most practical cars on the road, are by far the most fun. Realistically, this is by no means for everyone.

I would suggest a Wrangler to any teen, or teen at heart. The true reason anyone buy's a wrangler, including myself, is for those first days of true spring, when, after being couped up all winter, I can take off the roof, and the doors, and just enjoy the driving experience.

Sure, it doesn't have any of the luxuries of other cars, but if you are looking for a car like a wrangler, then luxury is obviously not your first priority.

This is the type of car for those few who want to feel in touch with the road under them.<br><br>
