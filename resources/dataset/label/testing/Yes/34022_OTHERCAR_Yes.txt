            Besides a few minor complaints (the biggest of which deals with customer service), I am a big fan of this camera.  The camera is small enough to fit in a pocket and is easy to take great pictures with.  

For beginners, or casual picture taking, the camera offers an automatic mode.  This mode chooses exposure, aperture, shutter speed, and flash settings automatically. You also have the ability to turn the flash off in this mode.  This is the most common method I use when taking my pictures.  You can also choose from small (640x480), medium2 (1024x768), medium1(1600x1200), and large(2048x1436) resolutions with three compression levels.  

If you choose to manually set camera settings the camera offers several modes that provide creative flexibility when taking pictures.  Shutter priority, aperture priority, and fully manual modes are available. Several other preset modes include portrait, landscape, night scene, fast shutter, and slow shutter modes. The camera also allows you to record up to 30 second videos at either 320x240 or 160x120. 

Another design point worth mentioning is the speed at which the camera takes pictures.  When first powering on the camera there is a several second delay (required to extend the lense from the body), but this is otherwise a very fast digital camera.  There are continuous and high speed continuous modes that take pictures at 2 and 3 frames per second respectively.

For the most part this camera does everything well.  The auto focus works well, unless of course you try to get too close to your subject.  The flash is adequate for most interior shots, although red-eye reduction is not always effective.  If the subject is looking directly at the camera, then the reduction seems to work fairly well.  If the subject is not looking directly at the lens, results are more mixed.  This has not been a huge issue with me, however, since red-eye is easily removed with the included image editing software.

The included software was easy to install and has been easy to use.  A basic editing program as well as the included remote capture software allows you to take pictures while the camera is connected to the PC, which is kind of neat but has not found much practical use from me.

The only real down side to this camera is the battery life, which will vary greatly depending on how you use the camera.  This is the price you pay for the compact size.  The LCD, flash, and lens motor are the biggest battery hogs. If you are taking daytime shots and not powering the camera on an off constantly (which causes the lens motor to run quite a bit) you can take over 100 pictures on a charge. This is only a minor issue, and again is expected for a compact camera.

Other than battery life, my other complaint about the camera involves Canon Customer Service.  When I originally received the camera, the battery was missing.  Since no AC adapter is included, I was unable to use the camera.  It took four customer service calls and about 2 weeks to receive the battery from Canon.

These two complaints, however, are not enough for me to not recommend this camera.

For some pictures I took with this camera see:

These pictures were taken in daylight using automatic mode with macro focus on.  All were taken using the "Super Fine" JPEG compression setting, with the first three at 1600 x 1200 and the last five at 2048 x 1536.
