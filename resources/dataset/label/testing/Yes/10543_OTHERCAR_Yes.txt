            I just bought a 96 Voyager in the past 3 months and have found it to be a true value. The price was right for a minivan...I expected to pay much more. The comfort of it is a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 and all who ride in it talk of it being comfortable. My mom who is 78 can get in and out of it without any problems and says she feels like she can see much better but doesnt feel like she is up high really. She even wants my dad to buy her one. It drives very easily and without any difficulty. The front window and nose of the van took a bit of getting used to but it parks into narrow spots w/ ease. The noise factor is minimal and dependability is maximal. My only complaint w/ it is the small gas tank....seems like it should hold at least 20 gallons...but best I can get in is 13. Thus it has to be filled more frequently than I like to do...esp on a long trip. But I rate it a 8 for sure.<br><br>
