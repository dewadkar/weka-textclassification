            Now I want to state outright that I do not own this vehicle... yet, but I have test drove it on numerous occasions.  I am particularly knowledgeable about cars in general and have experience in the automotive industry so I know what I'm talking about.  I am a senior University student and am currently looking to replace my current car, a 95 Ford Contour.  I have been looking for a car with the same road manners while being able to increase the amount of utility without sacrificing performance.  
The current VW Golf GLS 1.8T fits the bill and then some.  In Canada the car retails for slightly more than $25K and is well worth the money.  It looks more expensive than it really is and is a great value for the money.  It has a buttery smooth 1.8L 4 cylinder turbocharged motor with 150 Horsepower and is the very same motor found in the VW Jetta, New Beetle 1.8T, and the more expensive Audi A4 1.8T - which is a BMW fighter.  The motor is tried and true illustrated by it's wide use and is ultra-reliable.  It is also relatively fuel efficient (as long as you don't engage the turbos too much), but the downfall is that it takes premium fuel.  
The rest of the car from the paint job to the soft-touch interior plastics and cloth are very high quality.  The car is very solid and put together very well with no squeaks or rattles to speak of.  The motor is quiet while cruising but becomes loud at full acceleration (but it sounds soooo good) and there is a bit of tire noise which you can attribute to the junky factory tires (affects ALL vehicles) - just add some Toyos or Pirellis and all will be well.  The shifter is a bit notchy (I drove the 5 speed manual - the only way to get a car) but is otherwise very pleasant.       
The interior is not nearly as flashy and swoopy like its American-built competitors, but looks much more elegant and will stay looking fresher for a longer period of time while the American cars start to look dated very quickly. The same goes for the exterior (Just compare a 1995 BMW to any 1995 American car and you will see inside and out that the BMW's design looks more &quot;current&quot;).  The instrument cluster lighting, however, is awesome with a violet background and red needles - it looks completely cool and is very easy on the eyes.  
The hatchback is very useful for carrying stuff and there are numerous roof racks available from dealers that can accommodate everything from skis and snowboards to bikes.  
This is a car for anyone that appreciates a solid, well-built car that has above-average handling and performance.  The motor is an absolute jewel with plenty of power, yet it is fuel efficient as well. It is great for anyone involved in sports as well as the younger yuppie urban dwellers who appreciate a car with style... and it is a smart alternative to an oversized gas-guzzling SUV.    
Do yourself a favour and seriously consider this car. <br><br>
