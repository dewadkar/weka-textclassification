I. Toyota 4 Runner vs. Ford Explorer
My Family and I purchased a 1997 Toyota 4 Runner, about 6 months ago, after the transmission of our Ford Explorer, failed not once, but twice, all in a span of only 300 miles.  This obviously sent my family and I into a rage of fury and discomfort with owning any Ford, let alone an Explorer. So, my Family and I did the obvious thing to doï¿½

II. Purchasing the 4 Runner
	We purchased our 1997 Toyota 4 Runner from a regular Joe Schmo, right out of his garage for about $23,000.  My brother took the car up to college. Since then, it has done over 20,000 miles during its stay with our family it has never been in the shop.  The Explorer on the other hand was in and out monthly, and every time it came out, there was another problem with it. The Toyota 4 Runner we purchased was a Limited, which came with sun roof/Power Windows/Leather Interior, and in general was loaded with goodies.  How does it ride?  For any of you who have ever ridden in a Toyota Sienna (Toyota's latest minivan), well that is how it rides.  In other words, like a dream, not bumby, dosen't feel like it will roll.  It feels like a minivan you could take offroading.  SO......

III. Make the obvious decision 
	If you are buying an S.U.V. buy a Toyota 4 Runner.  I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
