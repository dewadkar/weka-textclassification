                The Chevy Cavalier is a very sporty looking car that is definitely worth the price.  The vehicle sells for an average of $15,000 and is very economical. 
     
There are several Cavalier Models.  There is the Cavalier Coupe, Sedan, Z24, and they also have convertibles.  
      
Some of the pros that the vehicle has is that it gets an average of 30 miles to the gallon and with gas prices these days that can be quite a savings. It is a very reliable vehicle.  I have not had any problems with it in the past year since I've owned it. Also the Coupe model is very sporty looking with out the high price.  
    
 Some of the cons of the vehicle, are that it isn't really spacious, but it is a compact vehicle and is not really meant for big families.  Also, most of the models are basically 2.2 liters and only have the 4 cylinder, which can put a damper on passing someone quickly.
   
 Overall, I think the vehicle is worth the investment.  It is reasonably priced, good on gas, and sporty looking.  If I were getting ready to buy another car, I definitely would buy another Cavalier.
