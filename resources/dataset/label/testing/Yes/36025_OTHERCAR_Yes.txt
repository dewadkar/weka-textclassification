            I've had my Paseo for a few years and am still very very fond of it!  I really researched it's price and size class and the Paseo fit my style.  It looks sportier than it really is, but had more pick up and control than the several other cars I drove in its price range.  It feels solid and not &quot;tinny&quot; at all, like too many of the lower priced vehicles.  It is not a family car as the back seat is very small and for very very short people, though it could easily work for a mom and small child.  Four people can fit in the car when needed. The bucket seats are fine for me though a little hard.  My husband, however, finds them uncomfortable for long trips.  The trunk has a lot of space--but looks are deceiving as I have trouble getting a large piece of luggage to fit in easily!  The sound system is really good for a preinstalled item.  I have had about 3 years and the repair bills have been routine service only.  It is a good car for someone who likes the looks, but doesn't have the budget or need for extra power.  This car is twice the Metro I just rented, though not much difference in price.  I suggest this for one who would like a car better than the &quot;low end&quot; out there but doesn't want to spend $20,000 on a car!  <br><br>
