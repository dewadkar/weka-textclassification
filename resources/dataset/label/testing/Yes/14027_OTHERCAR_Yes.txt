<TEXT>
            I purchased my '98 Pontiac Sunfire as a single girl living in the city.  At first, I loved my new little car because it has a great look, a nice interior, and I enjoyed the standard transmission.  Plus, it gets great gas mileage and its compact size makes parking a cinch.

However,  when I acquired a 6'3&quot; fiancee, I realized the car has got to go soon! We have absolutely no room in front and every time I shift into third or fifth I crack him on the kneecaps.  It's still fun to drive and plenty roomy when I am in the car alone but travel together for longer than a few miles is fairly miserable.  

Also, if you eat or drink in the car (like me!) the cup holder in this model is horribly misplaced.  Many large drinks won't fit and if you have plastic cups, you run the risk of hitting your drink when shifting to third or fifth.  I have several drops of pop on the inside of my windshield!  <br><br>
