            ____Back in May I traded my '96 Ranger in for a 2000. I knew I wanted to get another Ranger. Being in the military, I don't live near my family and I usually have a long drive to go see anyone when I go away on leave. I like being able to toss my bags in the back and not have it cluttered up around me. Plus it gets great mileage. My '96 had a 4 cylinder which got really awesome mileage, but had no power. My 2000 has a V6 which gives you the best of both worlds. 

____I also made the upgrade to Super-Cab. When I'm on a long trip, I like to be able to kick the seat back and take a quick snooze to refresh myself. In my old one I couldn't do that; I had to curl up on the seat underneath the steering wheel almost. Really uncomfortable. There are also several new other things I didn't get before. Like the standard CD Player that comes in all 2000 Rangers. You also get a set of anti-theft keys that have a microchip inside them. You can't your truck without these keys. Which means you cant hot-wire the truck, which translates to savings on your insurance. The rear window and the door windows come tinted too. You also have an option to where you can trun off your passenger side airbag, a really good option if you have children.

____There really isn't anything that I hate about this truck. I've been very happy with it.

____Like I said, mine is a V6 so it has plenty of pickup. The suspension is really good too. You don't feel every little bump and crack in the road. Like any pickup, it's light in the rear so you'll want to put some weight in your bed and take your time turning when it's wet or icy because you'll fishtail in a heartbeat.

This is a great, all-purpose pickup and I would recommend it to anyone.
