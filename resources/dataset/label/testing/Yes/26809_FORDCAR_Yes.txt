            The expidition is amazing.  It is an incredibly smooth ride (this coming from an owner of a cadillac) and the sounds system is great (something as a music lover I look for in a car).  This being the winter and all, I am glad I have this car now.  We have been getting a lot of snow and ice around here and without it I dont know what I would do.

Safety freak?  How much safer cna this car get?  God forbid you get into an accident.  Well, its you vs. a neon I dont think youll have a problem.  This is one of the biggest suv's on the road today.

My only complaint about the car is the back seat.  Its so high to the ceiling that if you are about 5'8&quot; or taller you actually have to worry about bumping your head on the ceiling just sitting there. Also, its BIG so for newer divers it can be hard to manuvuer.
