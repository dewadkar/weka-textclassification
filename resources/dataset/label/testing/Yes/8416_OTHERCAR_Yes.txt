            I have been using my D-600L about a 1 1/2 now. When I bought it it was the number one rated digital camera and I certainly have no regrets about purchasing it. Pictures are sharp and colors are natural in all modes. 

I get 32 pictures in standard mode on a 4MB card. These are more than adequate for a web page or for the screen. In high resolution mode I only get 4 pictures on the 4MB card but they are wonderful. I can print them to photo quality paper on my Epson color 800 at 8 1/2 by 11 and the output is remarkable. Not quite photo quality but good enough to hang on the wall.

I would purchase one of the new 32 MB cards just for the ability to take more pictures at one time. My only complaint with the camera is the way it eats batteries ( I understand that most digital cameras suffer the same condition ). Buy a good set or two of rechargeable ni-cads and keep them charged. I will go through a set of batteries about every 32 pictures.

There are newer cameras on the market today ( Olympus's new 2 megapixel camera is one I'd sure like to try ) but I'll stay with the D-600L for a while yet. It's 3-1 zoom lens, all glass lens system and auto focus plus built in flash make it a shutterbug's dream. At $700 ( today's price ) it is not the cheapest camera but it is worth every cent.
