            After bugging my husband for a year to get me a new car, he finally broke down and we started looking.  We looked for months to find the one that we really wanted and kept on coming back to look at the Explorers.  After test driving them I knew that this was my dream car. Buying a new one was just not in our budget, but we found a 95, that we could fit in for payments.  : )  I have had it for almost a year now, and it is the BEST!! I love the way it looks, drives, handles and all of the extra add ons that it came with.  When it comes time for a new car again, Explorers will be the first thing I go and look at again!!<br><br>
