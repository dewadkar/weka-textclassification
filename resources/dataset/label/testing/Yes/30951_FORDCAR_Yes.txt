            I bought this car after reading several positive reviews in the auto magazines.  It has been everything I hoped for, considering my budget and needs.

I needed a four door sedan, for the kids sake.  However, I wanted a six cyl. engine with a 5 speed manual transmission.  This left me with the Contour or the Mazda 626 or Camary, both of which, were out of my price range.

I love the engine on this car!  With 170 horses on tap, it really moves great.  It comes on the cam at about 4,000 rpm and pulls very strongly until peak revs.  Many have complained about the poor feel of the manual transmission.  I replaced the standard Ford fluid with synthetic, which definitely improved it.  It's not silky smooth like a Honda's, but it is adequate.  Unlike some others, I like the reverse gear lock-out, which required you to pull up on a ring to shift the transmission into reverse.  It gives me added confidence when making downshifts on the highway.

The four-wheel disc brakes are powerful, but seem to warp very easily.  I always seem to have a bit of a shutter, within 3 months of getting a brake job.

The fuel economy is a little worse than I expected, but given the powerful engine, it's something that I can live with.

I've had two design related problems.  The water pump impeller on my engine broke, leaving me stranded on the highway.  Usually water pumps break due to bearing failure.  A broken impeller is highly unusual and is apparently common on this engine.  I also had a coil spring break on a Macpherson strut.  This resulted in un-even tire wear, so I ended up having to prematurely get new tires.  I don't think that spring breaks are common.  It's probably a design defect as well.

Speaking of tires, the tire sizes on my GL are weird - 195/65 R14's - which are hard to find.  This usually means that I can't get tires on sale.

Owners of this car seem to love it and even have their own web site, www.contour.org.
