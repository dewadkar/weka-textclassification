            I came to be the owner of a 1993 Honda Accord LX sedan a year ago through my mother, a Honda fanatic who insisted that I owned a reliable car. She bought it for me for $4600.

She was right on the mark in terms of reliability. There have been no major repairs done on the vehicle at all, only general maintenance (belts, fluids, filters, tires).

But that is where most of the appeal of this car ends. On the outside, this generation Accord looks handsome, unoffending, and polite. It doesn't call attention to itself like the questionably styled Taurus, nor is it unpretty like the same-year Hyundai Sonata. The Accord is elegantly simple, or simply elegant. The paint after about ten years scratches easily, but retains much of its shine and luster. Turtle Wax scratch remover works wonders on this white paint, perhaps it works too easily.

I took the car across the country, from St Louis MO to Spokane WA, and it served me fairly well. At no point did it Wow me, nor did it ever offend me. Gas mileage on the highway was fantastic at about 30-35mpg, with a range that matches many touring sedans. The seats severely lacked lower back support, but side bolstering was adequate.

The speed limiter kicked in at 112mph.

Within a few days of ownership, some of the stock Honda speakers (for the stock Honda radio) had blown. The part was $57 at the dealer, and seem to sound far better than any aftermarket solutions I tried as replacements. Fortunately, the same speaker was at a junk yard for $4.

Inside, rocker panel plastics and seat belt cover plastics felt extremely cheap and flimsy, but the more frequently touched dash plastics and control stalks felt rock solid, almost Teutonic in how they felt. When activating the turn signal or the wipers, it seemed to feel solid and stalks moved with a reassuring and precise feeling, unlike the loose feeling associated with many GM products of the same vintage. The dash had storage areas for sunglasses, maps, or anything else, with a clock conveniently placed separately from the radio display.

I can proudly say there was not one creak, groan, or peculiar noise before, during, or after my road trip.

Doors close with a reassuring "thunk," essential to the overall feel for such a lightweight car.

Room for four is cramped. Trunk space is ample, with enough room to store luggage for three passengers on a long drive, a couple weeks worth of groceries, or some computers. The trunk mouth opens far and wide for exceptionally easy access.

Thanks to gearing, the four-cylinder Accord never feels sluggish at all in town. It zips through traffic like a much smaller car would, and takes turns precisely and with a degree of confidence. Unfortunately, the automatic transmission shifts roughly even brand new.

On the highway during my 2800-mile adventure, I felt intimidated by most other cars, somewhat strong wind, and large trucks. Going past a semi-truck at 75mph, I could feel the car being lifted and pushed aside, questionable for safety on especially icy roads. The Accord was capable enough for taking a long drive, but was clearly designed for moderate-distance commuting and in-town errand runs.

Climate controls were a bit fussy, requiring me to make constant adjustments.

Overall, for most folks, the Accord is a fantastic vehicle. Clearly, it is rock solid reliable, with cheap and bountiful parts supplies and extremely low maintenance required. It feels strong enough to last, light on its feet enough to take corners, but is lacking anything to inspire total confidence in driving.

For those of us who are enthusiasts, who crave just a little bit more from our cars, the Accord may be a disappointment (much like the Camry, Taurus, Intrepid, and other vehicles would be). I actually sold mine and bought an Infiniti Q45.

But for the masses paying midsized prices for midsized cars, one would be very hard pressed to find anything more refined, precisely engineered, fun to drive, and ridiculously reliable.
