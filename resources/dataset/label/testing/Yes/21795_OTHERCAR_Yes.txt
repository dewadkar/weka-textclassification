            Both the Suberban and the Blazer are nice automoblies but neither provide the balence and power that is the Tahoe.  Now I'm as much for lots of room as the next guy but the Suberban is overkill, there is more space than i know what to do with.  I love the performance but it was just not the car for me.  Then it was time to try the Blazer, I found that it was also nice but it was lacking the room of the Surbaban. There would be no room to comfortably seat my backseat passengers.  So I decided apon a compromise of sorts. I took the Power of the Suberban and the convience of the Blazer thats right i got the Tahoe.  I know it isent as big as some other cars out there but its is more than enough room for me and I'm very happy with the desicion.  The only real downside to this beast of a car is the gas mileage. I live in a fairly urban area and most of the driving I do is stop and go traffic.  I would reccomend this car more for someone who will not have to deal with seven stops in two miles and therfore a 14 mile to the gallon tank. 
	Regardless this is the best of the three and worth the cash.  <br><br>
