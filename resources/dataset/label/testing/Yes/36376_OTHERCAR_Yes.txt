            i am eighteen and two years ago i bought my first car.  it is a '94 honda accord and i absolutely LOVE this car.  i bought it used for around 10 grand and it has given me absolutely no problems.  it had even been in a wreck before i got it.  it runs smoothly and looks great, and is the perfect size for a teenager's first car.  it's not a tank, but is very protective, and it is very sleek and stylish.  i think this car is for everyone; it is affordable, runs AMAZINGLY well, has great safety features, and is an all-around great piece of machinery.  for your first car or your tenth, i think honda accords are the best car there is.<br><br>
