            After about four months of intense shopping I recently purchased a '99.5 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro, with the Tiptronic transmission. The purchase isn't all that unusual, except that for 3 1/2 months of shopping, I looked only at used BMW 3-series cars, model years 96-98. I was serious about buying a BMW, and didn't intend to consider anything else.

It's funny how these things can turn out.

My goal was to buy a 328i with fairly low miles. For cars in the model years '96 to '98, that means a price of maybe $26,900 to $31,900, depending on condition and installed packages. That's the price for &quot;certified&quot; cars at a BMW dealer -- in first-class shape and with extended warranties.

I drove a lot of BMWs during those months of shopping. The cars are great to drive, but I kept having one nagging thought: &quot;This interior is pretty dated ... and very spartan.&quot; Yes, the BMW is a &quot;driving machine,&quot; but shouldn't comfort be a consideration? The installed stereo is mediocre, and for nearly all used cars at the dealer, the CD changer has been removed. So add at least $500 to the price for the CD changer.

The '99 BMWs have much improved interiors, but the price gets well over $30,000. I intended to stay as close to $25,000 as possible.

I found a private seller with a '96 2-door 328i, very pampered, low miles, and he wanted $25,300. I didn't want a 2-door, but this was the best of the dozen or so cars I considered.

I stopped by an Audi dealer just because I happened to be driving by. I have often admired the look of the A4, which I consider one of the most beautiful designs of the '90s. But I was determined to buy a BMW.

I test drove a '97 A4 Quattro 2.8, pearl color, and I was blown away. The '97 model year has the 12-valve engine and 18 less horsepower, but the car    performed very well. The interior was understated yet as gorgeous as the exterior. And the seats and ride are supremely comfortable. The dealer's asking price on this car was $23,600, well under my target. It had only 32,000 miles.

The car had just come in, and still needed some work, so I decided to come back the next weekend to take a look. When I returned, I noticed a '99 black A4 sitting nearby. The price: $26,900. The dealer assured me he could deal on the '99 because it had 42,000 miles (impressive driving in one year!) and because they had taken it in on a trade.

So I drove the black A4. The '99 has a 30-valve engine and 190 horsepower.  It is not blow-away fast with the automatic, but it is powerful and the ride is supple. the car had a grey leather interior with elegant burl wood trim. And it had the Bose stereo (150 watts) with the CD changer installed. And it was &quot;certified,&quot; meaning a good warranty lasting until 2004 or 75,000 miles. (I will hit 75k about mid-2004.) And it came with the Tiptronic transmission, kind of a gimmick, but useful for getting onto expressways and for mountain driving.

My thoughts were drifting away from BMW.

Tip on the A4: The 99s had a mid-year design change, with some exterior and interior tweaks. Look for the new-style clear headlights and the fog lights installed in the air dam. That's the 99.5 version.

I got the car for $25,000, exactly my target.

The fit and finish are superb. It looks and runs like brand new, even though it has 42k.

Here was my thinking:

BMW pluses: stronger acceleration (horsepower is the same, but automatic shift points are more aggressive), crisper handling, bit better resale value, bit better rear seat room.

Audi pluses: better looking inside and out, Quattro all-wheel drive is much superior in bad weather, much better value, much better stereo, Tiptronic shifter for the automatic, interior is vastly superior to the pre-99 BMWs, ride is more supple.

BMW minuses: Too costly for what you get, grim interior, weak stereo, extra cost for CD changer, poor trunk space. (Don't even consider a 323i in my opinion -- because you lose out on power and resale value.)

Audi minuses: resale value won't be as good as BMW, rear seat is cramped, more sedate acceleration and handling.

I believe the A4 would be the better choice even if the price were the same. As it is, it is a much better value. And since I bought a much-depreciated one-year-old car, I expect the resale value to hold up pretty well.

I recommend that if you are considering a '97-98 BMW, also take a look at the Audi A4, especially the 2.8 Quattro version, model year 99.5.<br><br>
