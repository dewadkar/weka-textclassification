            <b>Comparisons are a good way of gauging how good a vehicle competes in the market, and may bring up some points that wouldn't be noticed in a solitary road test. For that reason, I pitted the Montero Sport against the capable (and most equally priced) Isuzu Rodeo. I hope this format breaks the monotony and is helpful... Enjoy...</b>

{ANNOUNCER:}
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this evening's main event! Let's meet our players...
In this corner, weighing in at 3,860 pounds, the whoopin', hollerin', hee-hawin' ISUZU RODEO!
And in this corner, weighing in at 3,980 pounds, the sportiest of the sporty, the MITSUBISHI MONTERO SPORT!

BOB: This should be a great contest, Chuck. There seems to be quite a rivalry going on between these two vehicles.

CHUCK: That's right, Bob. The Montero Sport has been around only since 1996, but has already been compared to the Isuzu Rodeo numerous times. In the beginning, the Montero Sport soundly defeated the aging Rodeo. But now the Rodeo is redesigned, and is looking for revenge. Let's watch the fight. It's about to begin!

{DING DING!}

<b>[EXTERIOR: Montero Sport]</b>
BOB: Gee, Chuck, this is a tough one. The Montero Sport has had a lot of cosmetic surgery for 2000. It's exactly the same height as the Rodeo (65.6&quot;), slightly longer (178.3&quot; vs. 176.7&quot;) but not as wide (66.7&quot; vs. 70.4&quot;). The spare tire is mounted underneath. The Rodeo's spare can be tucked underneath or mounted on the rear. 

CHUCK: You and your numbers. Personally, I like the aggressive, macho styling of the Montero Sport. A real head-turner. The Rodeo's pleasing to the eye, but it looks like every other SUV out there. Plus, the rear door is a bit of a pain to open in comparison to the rear hatch of the Montero Sport. For this reason, I give the edge to the Mitsubishi.

<b>[CARGO SPACE: Montero Sport]</b>
BOB: Even though the Isuzu Rodeo has more overall cargo space with the seats folded DOWN (81 vs. 79 cubic feet), the Montero Sport has up to TEN feet more of cargo space with the seats folded UP.

CHUCK: And that's where cargo space really counts because you are less likely to fold down the seats when you have more room in the back. The advantage of two more cubic feet of total cargo space does not save the Rodeo here.

<b>[INTERIOR: Rodeo, in a squeaker]</b>
BOB: This one is pretty tough. On one hand, you have the Montero Sport. Nicely appointed. Comfortable seats. Good quality materials. Pretty spacious, too. The controls are within reach, but the dash looks a bit dated, screaming &quot;MAKE-UP!&quot; But no biggie. I have a problem with the standard AM/FM/CD stereo itself, however. The buttons are small, and positioned lowest on the dash. And, what if I want to play my &quot;Best of Neil Diamond&quot; cassettes? Too bad! No cassette player. Sorry, Neil.
Step-in height is a bit of a chore since it has the higher ground clearance of the two (8.7&quot; vs. 7.9&quot;). This is a plus for off-roaders, but a minus for city-commuters and families.

CHUCK: And on the other hand, there's the Isuzu Rodeo. The interior is equally well-appointed, comfortable, and well-finished. Head and legroom are about the same, although the Rodeo has a couple of extra inches of legroom in the back (1.5&quot;, actually). The 6-speaker factory stereo is very good, and an in-dash 6-CD changer is available to complement your Neil Diamond cassettes. Visibility is slightly better, the dash is more attractive, and the A/C seems like the stronger system of the two. If I HAD to pick a winner here, I would say the Rodeo by a nose.

<b>[ENGINE: Rodeo]</b>
BOB: This one's easy, Chuck. The Montero Sport weighs more than the Rodeo AND has the weaker engine. Its base V6 engine (173 HP, 188lb.-ft. torque) just does not compare to the gutsy V6 of the Rodeo (205 HP, 214lb.-ft. torque). Mitsubishi offers a more powerful V6 (200 HP, 228lb.-ft. torque), but it still doesn't feel as strong, and such an upgrade obviously would jack the price up. The hesitant automatic is not as confident as the Rodeo's, either. Both of the Montero Sport engines are SOHC- not as sophisticated as the DOHC Isuzu engine.

CHUCK: Couldn't have said it better myself, Bob.

<b>[HANDLING: Rodeo]</b>
BOB: The Rodeo shorter than the Montero Sport, AND has a wider track. This makes for better turning. The tighter suspension of the Rodeo permits less body lean in turns than the Montero Sport.

CHUCK: Plus, the Rodeo has a smaller turning radius (half a foot), which is good for parking, or making U-turns.

<b>[RIDE: Montero Sport]</b>
BOB: The Montero Sport wins this one, but not necessarily from its own merits. The cabin is quiet and engine noise is only intrusive when really flooring the gas. And, it's decently smooth, although there's plenty of other utes out there with a more sophisticated suspension setup. 

CHUCK: But the Rodeo is just too darn bouncy. Going over uneven streets is a headache. This suspension may have helped in the handling category, but it still needs help. It is way too harsh over uneven terrain. The cabin is not quite as silent as the Montero Sport's, either. The Mitsubishi wins this round.

<b>[RELIABILITY/WARRANTY: Draw/Rodeo]</b>
BOB: Both of these cars have about average reliability, according to Consumer's Guide. So it's a draw, there.

CHUCK: But the Rodeo's got the advantage with its warranty. 3 years, 50000 miles bumper-to-bumper vs. 36000 only. And, its roadside assistance is FREE and for 5 years, 60000 miles. The Montero Sport is only for 3 years, 36000 miles. 

<b>[VALUE: Rodeo]</b>
BOB: I have to say, when the chips are down, the Rodeo wins this one. Just compare its LS model to the LS model on the Montero Sport. You get all the power features, the better V6, A/C, cruise, tilt, fog lamps, anti-theft system, keyless entry, etc... Only WITHOUT some of those options is the Montero Sport the same price. Add some options on, then the more expensive V6, and the Montero Sport gets quite pricey. If you don't mind forking out the cash, the Montero Sport DOES offer more luxurious features than the Rodeo.

CHUCK: Regardless of your choice, be sure to check out the rebates and incentives on the 1999 models. Mitsubishi is offering a $1,750 rebate on the Montero Sport, with 3.90% financing. The Rodeo has up to $3,500 off in dealer incentives. For more information, check out Edmunds.com...

<b>[WINNER: ISUZU RODEO by a 6-4 decision]</b>
BOB: Well, Chuck... it looks like the Rodeo connected on just too many punches out there. It was close, but the Rodeo won this one, folks.

CHUCK: Yeah, I guess it did, but not without a fight from the Montero Sport. It's a very good vehicle. My neighbor has had her 2000 XLS model for 3 months and she is thrilled with it. That shows that when it comes right down to it, it's the customer who makes the call. So YOU make the call. We hope that we helped you in your buying decision. If you haven't looked at the Montero Sport or the Rodeo and are considering an SUV, give them a good look. We give the Mitsubishi a 7.5 out of 10, and the Isuzu an 8 out of 10. That wraps it up for us... Good night out there.

BOB: Catch us next time for our Yugo vs. Porsche comparison! It should be a close one!

[*My experience with these two cars: I borrowed a RODEO LSE from a fellow student for 4 days and my neighbor swapped her MONTERO SPORT with my car for those 4 days. Thanks, Ann!
