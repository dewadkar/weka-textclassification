            I bought this vehicle after totalling my 93 Toyota Corrolla (another great car- held up well).  I had a 3 month old daughter, and I wanted something safe, kid-friendly, and sporty looking.  I didn't want to be a typical minivan driving mom.  My parents and my brother had both owned Saturns and loved them.  Anytime they needed service, the people were friendly and reasonable, and they never had any major problems with them.  

I have had my car now for almost three years, and I LOVE it!  It has child locks for both the doors and the windows.  It is a wide back seat so that three car seats, or two car seats and an adult, can fit back comfortably.  The back is terrific because it allows for a stroller to line the bottom, and then you can stack groceries or whatever else on top of it.  

I have never had any major problems with the car.  I had a couple minor problems, such as a window sticking and visors falling off, but both times the people at Saturn fixed them quickly and without hassle.  Also, for free because I have a five year warranty.  The car gets great gas mileage.  It goes over twenty five miles to the gallon.  <br><br>
