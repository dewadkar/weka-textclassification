            Ok - so you may have questions as to why I named my review - "Come on baby - you can do it!"  The fact is I love my Pontiac Sunfire - but he needs a little cajoling every once in a while to speed up from a dead stop, or make it up a hill.  There have been times where I have pushed on that darn accelerator praying - "Please God - make my car speed up before that Mack truck catches up with me and rear ends me."

My Sunfire is an orangy/red SE with 4 cylinders, a whopping audio system, and power everything.  I couldn't relate all of the logistics to you - I am ignorant to car details.  Let's just say it is pretty, and sporty, and not embarrassing at all to drive.  I test drove lots of vehicles until this one called to me.  At first I went "smart" and test drove the Honda Civic.  It was nice - but sensible.  I didn't want to be sensible.  I tried out the Mazda "Protege" - again I felt that old sensibility pang come back.  When I was at the Mazda dealership I saw Pontiacs lined up.  They were spicy...but domestic.  "NO" I told myself - "buy foreign".  I had spent hours on the computer comparing one car to the other - and the best cars were always foreign.  But I was drawn to my shiny red spitfire car.  I loved the rims on the tires - the back tail fin - the white lights on the two sides of the rear, the way the front looked cut and angled.  When I sat behind the wheel I felt cool - not matronly.  Man - the dashboard lights shined red!!!   This was no sensible car!

I admit it - my car is a lease.  I wanted to make sure that sensibility doesn't end up ringing true before I dive into "fun" car world.  I have had two minor problems with the car already.  My ABS Braking System went bad after 1 month and had to be replaced, and the motor for my power windows also gave out soon after driving off the lot.  My window was stuck in the down position - fun, fun, fun - just what I was looking for in my car, some fun.

Overall I am moderately happy.  The car has more space than you would think.  It outfills my mother's Chrysler Sebring in both the back seat and the trunk.  It is great on gas, and allows for a smooth and not too noisy ride.  I have driven on two long road trips (one from New Hampshire to Florida) with the car - and couldn't have been more pleased with the comfort and ease in handling.  I just wish it had better pickup!!  

For those who have already read this opinion - I am adding an ammendment:
     On January 19th I was involved in a car accident with my pretty little Pontiac Sunfire!  Now I love her even more!  On the outside she is badly battered.  She took a straight to the driver's side hit by a Ford F-350 truck.  The truck driver was running a stop sign trying to beat oncoming traffic - which included me in my red sporty Pontiac (going the speed limit mind you) and a school bus full of kids.  He hit me; I narrowly avoided the bus (thankfully); I spun around 4 times, and stopped facing oncoming traffic.  It was quite a scare.  I thank God that my Pontiac reacted exacly as it should - taking the brunt of the impact, buckling in just the right spots, leaving me miraculously untouched!!  I walked out of the car totally unhurt!  The car sustained over $8000 in damages, but it protected me as any car worth owning should!
