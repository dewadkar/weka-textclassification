            This camera is a great choice for those people who are just starting to get into digital photo world.  From the one-step interface w/your computer, to the point and click nature of the camera, you would be hard pressed to find a more suitable "starter" camera.

It comes with 8Mb of memory to start, so those people wishing for more storage capacity will have to purchase an extra flash memory card.  It is also a 2.31 megapixel picture capacity which is higher than most similarly priced cameras in its category.  The LCD color screen on the back of the camera is very clear as well, but takes a bit too long for the full picture to materialize, not to mention the fact that using the screen eats  up battery life rapidly.

This is to be expected, but the only problem I have w/the camera is that the quality of the pictures taken in low light are poorer than the more expensive cameras out there.  Sometimes the picture seems a little "washed out" b/c you cannot make any sensitivity adjustments for lighting.  Having said that, the picture is by no means terrible, and I have taken many daylight photos that look fantastic.  It's just that the flash on this camera seems a little obtrusive when the environment is too dark.

Another thing to be aware of, is that there is only a digital zoom on this camera which pixelates the picture a bit.  If you are looking for a camera w/great zoom capabilities, you should probably look elsewhere.
