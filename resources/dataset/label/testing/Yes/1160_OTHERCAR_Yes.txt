            I am not the most technically minded person in the world so I don't know anything about BHP, or anything else!

My 'little red strawberry' is a nice looking car that gets me from A to B. I don't care if it doesn't burn everything off, or have mega acceleration, as long as it is reliable! So far, touch wood, I have had no problems with the Neon.

It gets me to my destination with little fuss, perhaps a little noisily, and uses an adequate amount of gas. Not the most efficient car in the world though!

The car is comfortable, even on fairly long journeys, although I wouldn't take it on a journey longer than 8 hours.

The model I have is fairly basic, and security isn't the best, but then all the thief really has to do is break a window, so any car isn't that safe. The car handles well, although doesn't take turns at too high a speed to well (what car does!).

Overall the Neon is a nice car for a young family who can't afford something more luxurious. Good for a few years!<br><br>
