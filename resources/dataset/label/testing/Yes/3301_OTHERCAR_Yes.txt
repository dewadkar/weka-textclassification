            <b> OVERVIEW </b>

There are some cars out there that make you think about your personal preferences.

I'm not an SUV fan. I don't like them because they are not as safe as people make them to be, and they handle so sluggishly. However, when I sat behind the wheel of my sister's Toyota 4Runner, I couldn't help but re-evaluate my stance on SUV's.

<b> FEATURES: (7/10) </b>

The 1995 4Runner SR5 is the base model for the SR5 series. It didn't come with that many options. Standard options include a 4-cylinder engine, 5-speed transmission, ABS, power steering, power rear window, skid plates, defrosters, and center console.

Air conditioning is frosty and defoggers do the job quickly without leaving annoying traces. AM/FM with cassette player comes standard, but my sister has a 6-CD changer. The sound system is adequate, though pale compared to a real sound system. Not much to get excited about in this category.

<b> COMFORT: (8/10) </b>

Time to build up some excitement. The interior includes a standard dash cluster (speed, tach, fuel, trip, odometer), cupholders, center console, Velour cloth seats, all wrapped up in an ash gray color.

The ride is quiet and there are no rattles. Five people can comfortably sit inside the vehicle. In fact, they can go ahead and stretch their legs out. There is so much space inside this SUV. The cargo room alone holds 78 cubic feet of space. This baby can handle those Home Depot freight runs like nothing.

All of this makes for a reasonably comfortable ride. However, there are a few things that irk me. One, the driver side seats are pretty high. I'm 5'8", but I still stretch myself out, even with the seat in the middle position on the rails. I just push the seat all the way forward and pull it back about 1/5's of the way, and that would be my comfort spot. Also, the cupholders tend to get in the way of the shifter. This doesn't bother me since I tell everyone to put their drinks on their laps.

Just a minor setback. Aside from those two, you can sleep in this car. It is that comfortable.

<b> ENGINE: (9/10) </b>

Under the hood is a 2.4 liter, 4-cylinder engine that produces a surprising amount of power. You may not expect much out of a small-sized engine that produces only 116 hp, but you will definitely feel the 140 foot-lb. of torque. The 4Runner produces so much torque, it's actually easy to squeal the tires from standstill!

We've never tried towing a trailer to the SUV, but we've put plenty of weight before when my sister moved to her new house a few years ago. This thing can still haul after loading it down with nearly 800 lbs of extra weight. If 4-cylinder model is this deceptively powerful, I can only imagine how the V6 performs.

Naturally, this car guzzles gas at a high rate (I averaged 21 miles on the highway.) Then again, that's expected of a SUV. Good thing most of them use regular gas.

<b> POWERTRAIN: (8/10) </b>

The 4WD drivetrain is mated with a standard 5-speed transmission, though you can have a 4-speed automatic for a little extra. If you want to have LOTS of fun with this baby, stick with the manual tranny. 

Shifting is smooth and precise. The shifter really sticks into position when you get it in gear. It's not all loosey goosy like some cars, so shifting is relatively effortless. The clutch is rather high though. The first gear on this one can be difficult to get used to. I've held up my share of traffic on my first few go-arounds in the 4Runner. Once you've mastered it, everything else is child's play. The clutch does make a slight squeaky noise when you depress it sometimes, but this has occurred only recently, and a checkup may remedy this minor annoyance.

The whole system really keeps you glued to the road. You can take sharp corners at high speed and not feel like you're about to tip over. The wide track seems to make the care more stable than some other SUV's. Well done!

<b> HANDLING: (8/10) </b>

Again, this truck really sticks to the road. It's very stable, so it doesn't feel like you're going to tip over if you take a sharp corner too fast. Then again, the 4Runner doesn't turn on a dime. Which is okay, since I'd prefer added stability for an SUV.

The suspension is quite stiff, so there tends to be some jarring and jostling on really rough roads. Sometimes, it gets so intense that my sister uses the sedan when she's pregnant. Aside from this, the ride quality and performance is smooth and stable.

<b> RELIABILITY: (10/10) </b>

WOW! Toyota really knows how to make their cars last. In the many years my sister has owned this vehicle, she said she never had to take the SUV to the shop for a major repair. Aside from typical oil, pads, and belt replacements, nothing vital ever needed repair. Who knows what makes this car so versatile? Perhaps it's made of adamantium.

I doubt you will ever have to take out a mortgage to fix something expensive (like a distributor just dying on you for no reason) in this car. This one has over 140,000 miles on it and everything (except the tires, oil, and the timing belt) are original parts. 

<b> SAFETY: (9/10) </b>

As long as you follow all the rules of the road, the 4Runner will get you there effortlessly. Driver and passenger SRS comes standard. Other safety options include child locks and double-restraint safety belts. If something were to hit this, I'm sure the other guy would suffer more damage than you would. This is one tough truck.

<b> VALUE: (9/10) </b>

My sister bought this brand new for almost $23,000. These models are pretty expensive, but you really get the most out of your money. You get such a remarkable vehicle in the deal.

If you're thinking of getting a used '95 SR5, a similar model in good condition should be less than $9,000. You might even find some as low as $5,500! If you find a really good one, you could save so much money on maintenance. This car has given us no problems.

<b> OVERALL: (9/10) </b>

The '95 Toyota 4Runner SR5 is outstanding throughout. It is nearly flawless. Fun to drive, great for the family, even better for the long haul. If you are sick of dealing with crappy cars that swell up your maintenance bills, or if you just want to get a damn good SUV, look no further. This is about as good as a Sports Utility Vehicle can get.
