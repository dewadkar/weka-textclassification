            I rented a Chevy Blazer during the summer and drove several hundred miles in it. In this short time I managed to know the car well enough to develop my own mind about it.

I am an European, therefore I am used to European standards - both when it comes to reads and cars. The matter of US roads I have covered in a different opinion. Now the time has come to deal with the cars.

The first car I have ever driven in the US was the Chevrolet Blazer. I rented it for two days and made over 700 miles in it. 

What I liked about the car:

- original <b>looks</b>; remember I live in Europe. You don't see American cars all that often here. And a Blazer is a real rare sight. As said - I like the looks of this car very much. The Blazer is proportional from any angle and very pleasing to the eye. The one I had came was beige and had beige (cloth) upholstery.

- <b>size</b>; for my standards this car is big/huge. Sure there are such monsters like the Ford's Expedition and Excursion. But I would be afraid even to think of driving it. My driver's license was issued for passenger cars and not BUSES/SEMI TRUCKS. Blazer's size is however acceptable for me. Big enough to give me abundant comfort and a pleasing feeling of safety and yet small enough for me to be able to easily maneuver it.

- <b>user friendliness</b>; this car is surprisingly easy to drive. No problems in the parking lots. No problems in the traffic. Effortless driving on the highways. The Blazer also comes with a whole lot of storage space. Except the enormous trunk, you have a number of cup holders (now that was a surprise - I've never seen a cup holder on the dashboard of any European car I've ever driven), map-holders, key-holders and various you-name-it-holders. Putting you simply - if you're an organized person you'll feel at home taking your place in the Blazer.

- <b>performance</b>; I was quite pleased to find out that the Blazer actually can accelerate. Huge as it looks it made an impression on me that it would barely move. But when I pushed the &quot;pedal to the metal&quot;, half expecting a high roar and a lot of black smoke coming out from the exhaust pipe, I was shocked by the car's response. The acceleration rate was good enough to easily overtake other cars and trucks on the highway. I wouldn't however try any reckless driving in the Blazer. It is quick, but not just quick enough.

- <b>comfort</b>; big, soft seats and very soft suspension. I had the impression of floating over the road. Quite surprising in a car of this class.

The drawbacks:

- <b>softness</b>; I had a horrifying experience when I tried to do some cornering at about 40 mph. I was very close to believing that two wheels on one side of the vehicle lost contact to the ground. The roll is immense and far from acceptable.

- <b>thirst</b>; I think Blazer drinks gas the same way you gulp water on a hot and sunny day. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a whirl in the gas-tank, even at low speeds.

- the <b>gear-box</b>; the Blazer was the first automatic car I've ever driven. And I hated the gear-box they put in it. It seemed to think for itself leaving very little for me to influence. I didn't like the impression of being dependent on the machine that made questionable decisions (like dropping down a gear when cruising at a constant speed, what only contributed to a greater noise level in the cabin and boosted the fuel consumption).

Other than that the Blazer proved to be a very trusty companion during our two-day relationship. It made me take a new, more understanding approach towards American cars. 

I think I would recommend the Blazer to anyone looking for a decent (mid-sized - is that how you call them?) SUV. It really is worth to be considered as a potential purchase.<br><br>
