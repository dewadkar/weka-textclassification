            I looked at all the digital cameras in the $300-$500 price range before deciding on the Canon PowerShot S10, and I am glad I went with the Canon. Of all the cameras I looked at, the Canon offered the most features in the smallest, most well-built body available. Also, when looking through the viewfinder with my left eye, my nose didn't smudge the LCD like it did on the other cameras. The fact that I found the S10 at Office-Max for $250 made the decision a no-brainer as well. (Don't bother rushing to O-Max as they were getting rid of their stock of S10s when I happened upon the deal back in October of 2000.) 

I bought the Canon for the following reasons after reading all the reviews:

Canon brand name
Compact, durable design
2.1mpx/accurate image quality
USB transfer (not offered on the Olympus D460/490)
Features (B&W, Night Scene, Internal memory for 1.7fps shooting, etc)
Ease of use
Ability to accept the IBM Microdrive/CF-Type II media
2x Optical zoom/4x digital zoom


Weaknesses of the S10:

The S10 Kit available in the US does not offer the DK110 rechargeable battery kit. This kit is a must! I found it for $75 at buy.com. I can buy the NB-5H batteries at buy.com for $27 too. Best prices I've seen on both items.

The internal flash is weak for large rooms, and there is no hot shoe for an additional flash.

LCD is hard to see in bright sunlight, but better than most.

The Auto White Balance sometimes allows for too much contrast when pictures are taken of bright objects in bright light.

In order to have some real fun with the S10, you need to dump the supplied 8MB CF card and spend $250 on a 340MB IBM Microdrive.

You must hold the camera really still when using the Night Scene mode or else the pictures will turn out blury.
