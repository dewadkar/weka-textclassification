            I have had my Bright Red Trans Am Firebird for just about 3 years now. It never fails to put a smile on my face every time I drive it. For a car stickered at just about 30k, I didn't expect to get the level of performance that I have gotten out of this car.

I opted for the 4-speed automatic transmission. I test drove the manual and found it to have long, imprecise throws and an overall heavy feel. The skip-shift was quite maddening as well. After multiple test drives in both, I decided that the auto didn't feel any slower overall and would be much better in the constant traffic that I deal with. There are times when I regret this (on windy secluded roads), but many many more where I am glad to have the auto (the rest of the time). 

At 4000 miles the transmission gave out and needed to be replaced. I was told that it was just a freak thing that doesn't happen often. I'm inclined to believe that since, in the past 46,000 miles, I have had no problems at all.

The Monsoon sound system is amazing. 500 watts through 10 speakers including dual subs is just impressive. The T-Tops are a cool feature. It's like having a convertible without the wind noise and leaking problems.

The interior is laid-out very nicely with everything in reach of the driver. Some people complain about the use of plastic on the interior, but I've received only compliments. I think the interior styling is very business-like without a lot of bells and whistles. The leather bucket seats feel great and are very supportive. The power adjustable driver&#146s seat can make just about anyone comfortable.

My complaints are that the stock tires, Goodyear Eagle RS/A's, are not very good. Their tread life is horrible, grip is suspect, cornering stability is lacking, and the price is double what it should be. Replace them with a set of Kuhmos, Sumimotos, Pilots, or Firehawks. The other thing is that the fog lights are such a pain to get to. Replacing a single fog light can cost upwards of $60 or $70.

Cops love to pay attention to obnoxious bright red sports cars...there's a news flash. Insurance is high for this car as well, again, not much of a shocker.

This car gets attention from everyone. Whether or not people have a positive or negative impression of Firebirds, they will notice it some how. The styling is aggressive, the sound is aggressive, and the performance is...well...you get the idea. There is just something cool about knowing that you can outright smoke just about anything that pulls up next to you. The only car to beat me in this thus far was a '01 &#145Vette (including '02 SVT Cobra, '01 Mustang GT, '94 3000GT, '04 350Z, and several rice rockets).

If you want an attention getting sports car with the power to back up the looks, you have found your car.
