            My wife and I recently spent quite a bit of time researching, test driving and contemplating which SUV we should buy.  After considering all the obvious choices in this price range and even the next one higher we ultimately decided on a the Rodeo (1999 version).  I can honestly say this is the one car that we've purchased, and we've had a few, that hasn't caused a bit of buyers remorse 6 months down the road. We haven't noticed any rattles, hums or other annoyances that are associated with vehicles like this. And thank goodness we got the 4wd option.  We frequently drive into Wisconsin on smaller unplowed roads and it made cutting through the snow safe and simple.
