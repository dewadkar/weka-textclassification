            Before I got married, my mother helped me buy a car.  I had just come home from military basic training and technical school.  I also had to go to my duty assignment in Northern California.  I had never had a car before.  So, this was my first car.

My mother cosigned, we, my husband and I, paid for the car.  We got the car when it had only 11 miles on it.  Now it is at 110,000 and going. 

We have driven it all over California.  My husband has even driven it to Nevada, in the snow.  It is our car.  We have been told we should sell the car and buy a new one.  

Well, we may not fit in it anymore as a family.  It's impossible to fit four car seats and two adults in a small car like the Nissan Sentra.  But, we have thought it over and decided we would rather keep the Sentra as a second car once we save up enough for a new car.  

In fact, my husband has been customizing the car little by little.  He has put in a new air filter, new wheels and tires, and had the car lowered.

Unfortunately, our car is resting right now.  The original clutch has finally given out after 110,000 miles.  When my husband was calling around for estimates on a new clutch, he was often told that most clutches should be replaced around 100,000 miles. 

We absolutely love our 1994 Nissan Sentra.  It may be too small for our large family right now.  All we do is take turns driving it.  We still take the children out for rides, just not all together.  They have to take turns going out with us.

One of the best things about this car is the mileage: approximately 32 highway, and 28 side streets.  Even with the high gas prices, we usually only spend $20 for a full tank of gas.  That usually last 1 1/2 weeks.  It also helps that we have a manual car.

Another great thing about the car is how small it is.  It can easily slip in and out of traffic, a good thing when you live in Los Angeles.  It is easy to park, even parallel parking is easy.

The steering is great.  It is very easy to maneuver around small streets, especially if someone cuts in ahead.  U-turns are so easy with this car.

We intend to keep this car.  Who knows?  Maybe our children will drive it later on.  Of course, they have to pay their own car insurance.  :0)<br><br>
