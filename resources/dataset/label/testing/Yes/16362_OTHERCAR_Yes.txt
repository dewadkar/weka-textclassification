            I have worked with alot of digital cameras in my computer training business. The HP C200 for the price is far the best camera I've used. The software provided with camera is exceptinally good as well. I have had many people look at my photos taken with this camers and all have told me that this camera takes extrodinary photos. You will never buy a roll of film again if your just the average photographer as I am. I never was much into photography until now. uBID.com is where I got mine for 229.00 and I screwed up I could of got it cheaper. I did see them for 300.00 in several stores. If you want a nice camera at low cost this is it.
