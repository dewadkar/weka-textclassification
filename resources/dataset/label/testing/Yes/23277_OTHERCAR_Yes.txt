            Purchased in 1991 as a family vehicle to haul our 4 kids and their friends, this automobile has become a member of our family!  With over 125,000 miles on it it remains dependable, safe transportation.   It has hauled everything from tons of groceries to furniture to landscaping rock.  After some initial transmission problems that were promptly resolved while under warranty, we have had to make a minimum number of repairs, mostly due to wear and tear.  My family loves taking vacations in it because there is plenty of room for luggage, coolers, etc. without sacrificing leg room.  The front seats recline giving the kids an opportunity to rest while on long drives.  I love the power windows, door locks, tailgate release, and seats.  The tailgate shelters me when I am loading or unloading groceries or other cargo in the rain.  When I drive another vehicle, I always miss the rear windshield wipers on my van and the comfortable arm rests on the driver's bucket seat.  I was hit from the rear while stopped at a red light last summer and nobody was hurt.  Next to driving a tank, this is one of the safest vehicles on the road!<br><br>
