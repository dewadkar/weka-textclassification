            I've used a lot of digital cameras, but this is the first that I purchased.  I was looking for a camera to put items on Ebay and take quick shots of events and gatherings.  This product fits the bill!

Usage:

The Olympus is very easy to use.  I found the menus easy to navigate and taking pictures is very easy.  When it comes to more complex settings, there are some advanced features for macro shots and taking pictures without a flash. Overall, a very easy camera to point and click, but don't expect too many fancy features.  You do have the ability to look at all your shots on the camera (up to 6 at time on the screen, I believe).  One neat feature allows you to perform edits to the pictures directly on the camera!  The camera take 2 AA batteries and they last about 6 hours (non-flash).  I got a second set and rapid charger and I'm pleased with the results.

Picture Quality:

The prints from this camera in the top quality setting are about as good as it gets for a 2.0 megapixel camera.  The colors are vivid and there is very little pixelation.  I highly recommend at least a 64mb memory card for this camera to get a decent amount of pictures.  

Construction:

The camera body and lens are decently constructed.  While the camera is light weight, I've dropped it several times and it never skipped a beat. The closed shell design keeps the lens protected when the camera is not in use. The cheap rubber cover for the USB port is really flimsy and I ended up ripping it off after about a year. It's a very annoying design.

More detailed Review:

I highly recommend checking out the review at Steve's Digicam site if you are seriously considering this camera.  It is very detailed and an excellent reference point.  Here is the link www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/d520.html
