            Anybody out there shopping for a large SUV should take a look at this one.  Let's see - bigger than a Landcruiser, better reliability than the domestics, cheaper than a Tahoe - game, set, match.  

For the tree huggers out there - it's an ultra low emissions vehicle that burns regular gas.  My net gasoline cost isn't much more than my all-wheel drive "energy efficient" Subaru that burns Premium fuel.

We wanted a vehicle that we could use to comfortably get up and down the East coast to follow our daughter's college soccer team AND was large enough to get the kids and their weekend visitors to and from college.  We bought the Sequoia in March of 2001 and have been loving it ever since.

This thing fits the bill.  Room for 8 (the three in the back should know each other) + all their stuff.  Unlike most minivans, it's suspension can easily handle the weight of a full load of passengers + all their belongings.  The Sequoia never flinches.

Convenience?  Both back rows of seats tumble up and out of the way easily if needed.  Back seat comes out with ease - tho' we've rarely needed that.  Liftgate and bumper provide cover and a nice seat in the rain.  Three 12 volt outlets up front alone!

Road manners?  Handles great for a vehicle this size not a sports car, mind you - but very comfortable.

We chose not to spring the extra 5k for the limited package - too much for leather, cd changer and a few other niceties.
