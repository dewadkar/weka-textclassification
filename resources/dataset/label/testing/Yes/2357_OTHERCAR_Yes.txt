            I bought this camera more than a year ago.  It was one of the first mega pixel camera out there for under $450.   With a budget under $450, I had to make a choice between a zoom camera with low resolution or no zoom with high pixel count.  I chose to go with the high mega pixel for one simple reason: I can always move my feet to get what I want in most cases, but I can't print a nice picture if I don't have a high resolution image.
The first thing that caught my eye was the silver color design. I liked it right away.  Then with the USB option and only $400, the decision didn't take long.  
The USB really made the download a simple task.  I have a 64mb flashcard and I can download all the pictures in couple of minutes.  The operation is easy.  There are large buttons in the back of the camera to set the camera to all of the usual settings: portrait, landscape, program mode and more.  
The image is sharp for still portrait and objects for print up to 8x10.  If you pan the camera, the image is still sharp for 3x5 or 4x6, but you will see a slight blur when go up to 8x10.  Of course you can't make the pan the camera too fast.
There are some weaknesses.  One big problem is the weak flash.  I was taking picture in a birthday party.  Before I left, I charged all my battery to full.  But all the pictures turn out to be dark.  I realize most of my pictures are group shots and I was always pretty far away from them.  After some test, I believe for best result, when using flash under low light, you needs not be farther than 10 feet.  In addition, the battery drain very fast when using battery in combination with LCD screen.  Both my battery drained after just the first flashcard.

But overall, it is still a good camera for its price range.
