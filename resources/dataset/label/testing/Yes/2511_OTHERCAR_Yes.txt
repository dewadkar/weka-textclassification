            Let me start by saying I am very lucky to be the proud owner of my 91 Toyota Pickup.  It is worth over 6,000 dollars with the canopy and snow tires that came with it when I bought it.  I actually bought it from my Grandfather so I know the entire vehicle history and her cut me a deal (I only paid 3,000 for it).  My particular truck is still in mint condition, it only has 45,000 miles on it (very low for a 91 model) and it is very reliable.  My truck is an automatic, without any power options, no power windows, no power locks, no power steering, but I do have Air Conditioning.  I don't mind that it doesn't have power steering, I kind of like to manhandle my truck.

Here is why you should consider buying a Toyota truck if given the chance.  They get great gas mileage, mine gets about 29-32 in the city and 35-39 on the highway.  Toyota cars and trucks are known to last well over 100,000 miles, I have seen a few myself that are over 200,000 with the original engine and transmission and are still going strong.  This little truck has the power to pull!  It can haul or tow quite a good load for its size.  This truck is only a four cylinder but I think the engine has been tricked into thinking it is a 6 cylinder, my little truck has better get up and go then a few of the sportier cars I have seen on the road.  My truck is also extremely reliable, I have never taken it to any shop for anything, I change the tires myself, I change the oil (and filter) myself, and other than that my truck has never needed any maintenance.

There are just a few downsides to this vehicle which I myself don't mind all that much.  There are a few squeaks now and then when driving a bumpy road, but what do you expect, it is a 91 model, it has been around for ten years.  The cab isn't exactly huge, two people are very comfortable in this cab, the seat is made for three but three people in the cab can be a little cramped but not too bad.  Last but not least is the rear end vehicle weight.  The back end is kind of light and the pickup is rear wheel drive, which poses a small problem for me in the winter time here where I live because we always have ice or snow on the roads.  This problem is easily fixed though, I have studded snow tires and I just throw a couple sand bags in the bag for extra weight and I am good to go.  The canopy on the back helps to add extra weight too.

Overall I love my truck!  I call it my little beast and all my friends make fun of me for it.  I admit, it is a little truck, but it has the heart of a beast!<br><br>
