            At first I did not like S-10's, but then I bought one. The S-10 I got is red, it is the standard cab model, it has a 5 speed transmission, and has the L35 option engine which has 190hp. I have been very impressed with the truck. It has plenty of power for its size, responds very good, and can pull about anything you put behind it. I would recommend this truck to anyone that wants one. I do recommend getting the 5 speed manual transmission. My truck has 86,000 miles on it and it runs just as good as when I got it. If you decide to put dual exhaust on this truck, they sound very good. These trucks have a very good potential of being one of the best small trucks out there. The cargo area has a good amount of space. The option of aluminum wheels is well worth it; they are very nice wheels and are easy to keep clean.
