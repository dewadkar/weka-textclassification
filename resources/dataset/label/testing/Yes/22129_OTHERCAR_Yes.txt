            The Kodak DC-215 is an excellent on-the-go camera.  It comes equipped with plug-and-play software that makes it easy to download your pictures.  I purchased this camera because of the trusted name, &quot;Kodak&quot;.  This camera is easy to use even for the most inexperienced operator.  You can purchase ScanDisks or larger size picture cards to store more pictures before downloading them.  This camera helps you capture pictures while an object is moving and gives you the option of deleting that picture if you do not like it.  The viewing area &quot;Screen&quot; helps you to focus the pictures without losing the important aspects of the photo.

When you download the pictures from the camera, they are easily converted into jpegs, bitmaps, of giff files.  This is important when you want to share your pictures over the web.  I enjoy everything about this camera and would recommend this camera to anyone age 8 to 100+.  It's fun, easy to use, and compact.<br><br>
