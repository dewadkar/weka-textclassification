            This is a fantastic car, Economic and dependable. I am a college student, and this is the best car for me. I bought it cause it was one of the only things that i could afford at the time. I travel long distances, it gets great  mileage. Minor care that you should do with any car has kept it running without a hitch in the past 3 years. And because it is so economical that any parts, filters, tires, etc. are very inexpensive. <br><br>
