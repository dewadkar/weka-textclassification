            We own a 2000 model year Ford Explorer XLT, 4WD with the 210 HP V6 motor.  This is our second Explorer, so we know this product pretty well�. Our first Explorer was a 2WD model and served us well in the Sunshine state, but relocation to colder (and potentially inclement conditions) convinced us that we needed a change. We bought both vehicles new, persuaded in good measure by Ford�s seductive 0.4% interest. Our experience with the replacement product has been far superior to the first model, so much so that I am today a little surprised that we bought a second one! In fact our 1999 model year Explorer exhibited many of the problems referred to in �IamTinaMarie�review �Experience with our Ford Explorer.� I have read that the 1999 model year suffered from a variety of electrical problems. We suffered the same issue with the wiper control, also the security system, door lock warning light, rear tail gate warning light, etc.. All very irritating! We traded that puppy in at just 5,000 miles and were glad to see the back of it.

So on to the Explorer we own today. Here�s the story� We bought it in the Sunshine state at the local Ford dealer new. It took us all of one hour to haggle and get the price to $850 below invoice. We bought the Explorer in the November and as an old model the dealer was delighted to lose it (as it had been a demonstrator and had a few miles on it). It was loaded with all the usual toys, except the CD juke box and moon roof. Both things we could live without! I drove it off of the lot two hours later and across the road to have a hitch fitted. A week later and we were off making our move to the north towing a 5,000 lb trailer to the other coast with some of our favorite possessions in tow. You know; the wife�s art supplies, my tools, the computer and every cat toy loved by our cat. The journey took forever as the trailer (a large 4 wheel RV model rented out by U-Haul) has a stated top speed of 45 mph � they are actually quite serious about that. (I had not factored that little piece of information into the plans!) So we ended up driving between 12-14 hours a day. Predictably the cat complained for the first half day � and then settled into a sulky silence (actually she travels quite well � for a cat.) We threaded our way slowly across from east to west coast, and then all the way up through California, Oregon and on. It was s-l-o-w going.  The Explorer had about 600 miles on it when we bought it. We managed to get the first service done, and start our journey at circa 1,000 miles � just enough to start considering towing. Well, credit to Ford. It went through the entire trip without so much as a burp, or hesitation � and despite Firestone tires, no problems. We went up hills with overdrive off, and down some � occasionally � in transmission lock to hold back that trailer. We were bounced around like the three musketeers at times (especially in Southern California � what do they do to the roads there?) We enjoyed the scenery from the Explorer�s commanding view. We did not get too uncomfortable despite all that bouncing, bucking and yawing � at times it felt more like a pogo-stick! On arrival we deposited the trailer, and somebody ripped off the tow ball � lesson learned, don�t leave the ball attached for sticky fingers�  The trailer did not fare so well on the journey. The first one never made it out of the U-Haul garage, its brakes locked up solid half way across the lot. The second made it here, but blew out three tires on the way (and no they were not made by you know who�) It also managed to chew through the electrical cable some where in Texas, three hours from any where in the dark � don�t you just love duct tape! U-Haul really rent some garbage at times� Anyway, the (by now) trusted Explorer got us to our destination in one piece after eleven (or was it twelve) days and 4,500 or so miles, without problem.
Since that epic baptism of fire the Explorer has served as the family bus, moving vehicle, delivery vehicle, occasional all terrain, dumper truck, and Home Grocer. To date it has never failed, and now has Good Year Wrangler tires courtesy of the Ford family. The paint is still good, and nothing has dropped off � yet.

The Explorer is serviced per schedule at the local Ford dealer. We had it serviced on the trip up by Ford of Riverside, California. They service RV�s so could accept the Explorer plus trailer � they were wonderfully friendly, and one of the guys even took the cat around to meet some of his buddies on the lot! Great service. The local dealer (Thanks Orange Team) does a good job. I wish it was not so expensive though.  I don�t know whether it is just me, but $600 for a 15,000 mile service strikes me as a little steep. The 30/60/90,000 mile service will set you back $650, while the �major� service comes in at a whopping $900 at 45/75,000!! Any of you out there buying a used one with high miles may want to consider paying that little bit more for the lower mileage vehicle!

Likes:

The Explorer has towing capacity as outlined above. The V6 high output engine does its job well. It�s not quite as torque bound as the V8 motor, and you�ll need to rev it a bit when approaching steep inclines, but other than that it�s a respectable motor.  We have done a lot of long trips in the Explorer and have found it very comfortable. Towing capacity and capability is superb, and something that the Explorer excels at (make sure you get the tow pack option!). It�s also a tough box of bits, which with regular service can take its fair share of the rough and ready.

Finally, the control-trac four wheel drive system is wonderful. It works. We have had it kick in on snow, gravel, and mud to great effect. The manual selection works when you need it. The low range is only for serious off road use, but again, works well. Also, unlike the V8 powered All-wheel-drive it is a little more sparing on tires, and saves gas. One to Ford!


Dislikes:

Gas consumption plain sucks! The V6 210 hp motor gets around 13mpg around town, sometimes a little less! On a long journey it gets a massive 15-16mpg. Ok so it�s shaped like a brick, so what do you expect, you might ask? Well, how come my neighbor�s Chevy Suburban gets slightly better? Case closed, gas consumption sucks. The V8 all-wheel-drive (AWD) is according to my friend even worse, and nothing like the sticker. So I guess it could be worse. The luggage space is ok, but nothing to get excited about. It won�t take a 4� x 8� sheet of plywood, which is a good measure of bulk capacity. You also need to read the owner�s manual quite carefully, as there are significant limits on how much you can carry (weight wise) inside the actual vehicle. You will also need to figure out the loading capacity of the vehicle and trailer combination carefully to avoid potentially unsafe situations. One of the more annoying features of the Explorer is the jiggle you get from the front end. This is not so bad around town, but on a long journey it is irritating and sometimes troublesome � i.e. when towing a large heavy trailer!

Braking is weak. It works well enough if there is nothing in front of you, but it can be a little entertaining in high speed, close quarter traffic. Don�t ask what it�s like with a trailer�.

Finally, the 4 WD model of the Explorer is a couple of inches higher than the 2WD model (to allow for the extra gear under the chassis.) The Explorer is a compromise in terms of road holding, and road use, and the four wheel drive function. As such, it�s no Indy cart, and you take your life in your hands if you treat it as such. In this regard the vehicle is rather over powered for its limited handling characteristics. 

Conclusion:

Despite all that�s wrong with the Explorer, it�s easy to get along with. The reliability has thus far (on model number two) been good.  It is versatile. It does nothing particularly well, other than tow large, heavy loads when you need it. When we come to replace the venerable Ford, we�ll look at all comers. If you are in the market for a used one, bear in mind the service costs before you buy that bargain high mileage lot special. Also, given the cost of repair, you may want to check out the service history.  

If you need an SUV Ford has been number one for a long time. Others to consider:

Toyota 4 Runner � Reliability and low depreciation
Ford Expedition - Capacity, and superior road holding (considered one of the best)
Chevy Tahoe � Capacity, gas consumption

The Explorer was, however, "Recommended" by Consumer Reports in its year of manufacture.

Final Word (Really!) 

Let�s look at reality for a minute. The 4WD option is to give improved traction in snow. These vehicles are not �good� off-road vehicles. If that�s your bag get a Land Rover 110, or a Jeep CJ7, or equivalent. The reason the Ford Explorer is narrow, is because they essentially reused the Ranger truck platform. They did the same with the F150 and the Expeditions, and so forth. These were not purpose designed four wheelers. Examine your needs before getting wrapped up in a fashion statement.
