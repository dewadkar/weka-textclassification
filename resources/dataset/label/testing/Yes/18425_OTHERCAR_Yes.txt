            I bought a 1997 Toyota Corolla CE brand new back in 1997.  At the time, I was doing a lot of travel for my job, and needed something dependable and good on gas.

Toyota's reputation for quality brought me to the dealership, and I was soon sold on the Corolla.  Though a little small for my taste, I knew I had a good, solid car that I could count on.

The Corolla served me well while I was on the road- usually averaging around 600 miles a week.  Gas mileage was great, and I spent very little on upkeep.  No repairs, just standard maintainance based on my heavy driving schedule.  My car had all options (power windows, power door locks, power steering and brakes, alarm, etc) except for CD player, which I did get installed after-market.

Now I know that the Corolla is quite reliable, and pretty safe with several features, including dual airbags.  But once my frequent travel on the job ended, my desire to own a car just for reliability and mileage also ended.  Then I started noticing a few downfalls that eventually drove me to trade the car for a larger one.

The Corolla is a very noisy car.  In order to hear it, I had to keep the radio tuned just a little louder than I really liked.  Engine and road noise seemed evident at any speed and on any road conditions.

And it is SMALL.  Just too small for a family of 4.  Yes, I knew that when I bought it, but the car just seemed to get smaller and smaller on me.

Otherwise, you just can't beat Toyota reliability.  It is a little more expensive than other cars in its class, but worth it in the long run.<br><br>
