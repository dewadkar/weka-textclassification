            Dear Saturn Friends,
I traded in my 1997 saturn sl2 for a 2000 model.  It is dark green on tan leather.  power moon roof, windows, doors, mirrors, cruise, abs, trac, tilt wheel, a/c, 10 disc cd changer and tape deck with auto tone, spoiler, and everything you could want and expect in a small compact sports sedan.  This car is more incredible than I can believe.  The noise level has been reduced by at least 85% and has a little higher gas milage from the refined engine and the transmission shifts smoother and more precise than in my 97.  The car does not have any vibration in the accelerator or the steering wheel.  The paint finish is even nicer than ever before.  I Just love this car so if you never test drove one, go try one out for yourself.  It is so much fun to drive especially on the highway.  you can dodge cars left and right due to its size, extremely strong handling capabilities, and nimbleness.  The ride is smooth and is better than any cavalier, ford, or foreign piece of junk out thee.  By the way, test drive a new saturn and they give you a gift if you visit the web site first!  the looks are also refined, new interior and dash.  no more squeeks as the dash is one unit rather than several plastic pieces.  much better quality
