            Our '90 Camry now has 205K miles on it now and it is still running strong and looks good.  But, the auto transmission is beginning to show signs of wear.  Therefore, I began looking for a replacement for it.  I started to look for another Camry.  We wanted to upgrade from the 4 cyl. to the 6 cyl.  During our initial search, we found a '95 Avalon XL with all the standard amenities - AT/AC/Moonroof/CD+AM/FM/PW/PL/PB/ABS/Airbags/Remote Entry/Security system, etc.  It was well underpriced with 88k miles on the odometer.

After meeting the owner and understanding their need to sell it (3 vehicles/2 drivers), I test drove the vehicle and was very impressed by the power of the engine and smoothness of the transmission.  It is also the roomiest vehicle we have ever considered for ownership.  This was a lot more car than we thought available for this kind of money so we had it checked out mechanically and for any hidden body damage.

It is incredibly roomy in the front and back.  The electric front bench seats are very easy to adjust and are very comfortable.  The bench seat means the shift lever is on the steering column but this configuration allows for the seating of 6 adults.  Driving this reminds me of a more nimble, quicker Ford Crown Victoria w/ V8 engine.

The trunk is very large and deep.  It can carry 4 sets of golf clubs and still has room for luggage.  The trunk opening is not very wide so carrying of large objects is not possible.  Also, there is no "pass through" feature of laying down the back seats to carry longer items in the trunk like the Camry.

The sound system is fine for a factory unit.  There is a large swing-down armrest for the front seat with two swing-out cup holders (for narrow base items like soda cans, only) and a large storage bin with a coin holder for tolls.  The glove compartment is relatively large and there are door pocket/shelves for additional storage of small items.  The dash has a compartment for CD storage.

The car drives very well for a larger vehicle and has an amazingly short turning radius - shorter than our smaller '90 Camry.  Like all Toyotas, there is not a lot of road feel.  The steering is very light and very fast.  I don't know the number of turns, lock-to-lock, but it feels like 2.25.  It has a soft ride but not much body lean or squat on heavy acceleration or dive on heavy brake applications.  It has somewhat performance tires as stock (215/60 15R) but the ride is not harsh.  There is some road noise.  There is noticeable wind noise from around the front door seal and mirror.

The moonroof is a full sliding type opening and has a rear tilt-up mode for ventilating without a lot of noise.

The headlights on this Avalon are a major improvement over the earlier Camrys.  They can "see" much further down the road but they are not the high-tech arc type of lamp.

The styling is not what I call very contemporary.  It doesn't look like a luxury car but it's not an econo-box, either.  I guess it is very utilitarian in shape with a good shape for minimal wind resistance.

Anyone familiar with a Camry will be right at home in this vehicle.  It is laid out the same way with the exception of the column mounted transmission shift lever.  This does present a bit of a problem.  There are three levers on the right side of the column - the transmission shift lever, the windshield wiper/washer lever and the cruise control.  When reaching for the cruise control level, I have accidentally engaged the wipers.  The cruise control now has a manual cancellation mode on the lever - that's good.

In summary, it's well designed with great interior space, handles competently, sports an eager engine and a smooth transmission and has a very large trunk.  What's not to like?  Styling is less than spectacular, however.  And, it does not have a sporty "feel" to it.  But, it accelerates beautifully and passing at freeway speeds is a snap.  And, like all Toyota products, I believe this vehicle will run well without major problems well past 200k miles.

If you're looking for luxury and room, this deserves your consideration.
