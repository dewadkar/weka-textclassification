            It has been a couple months since we traded in our junk 2000 Dodge Neon for the 2004 Toyota Rav4.  I've been trying to find little things that I don't like about the Rav4.  

The first thing that was bothering me was the middle back seatbelt was hanging down from the ceiling - leave it to Toyota to take care of that - you insert your key into one part of the seat belt - it releases completely from the seat and it stores nicely in a slot in the ceiling.  It will be rare that we have 5 travelling so I would prefer it stowed away.   

The <b>visibility</b> in the Rav4 is much better than my old car.  It was always a problem seeing the corners (front and back) but the Rav4 has much more visibility than I am used to. 

<b>Comfort</b>:  The drivers seat adjusts forward & back and also up and down.  Much more comfortable than we are used to - we think it would be a comfortable car for a 1,400 mile trip to Florida.  Hopefully we will get that chance next year.

<b>Road Noise</b>:  It is surprisingly quiet - in my old car when I used the cell phone there was always a complaint on the other end about the noise.  Its no problem now - there is very little road noise.  

<b>Instruments & Steering Wheel</b>:  Orange illuminated. Easy on the eyes at night.  Your speedometer is towards the left - Tachometer in the middle (smaller) and Gas Gauge to the right.  It has a little arrow pointing towards the fuel tank (drivers side). 

<b>Power</b>:  The 2.4 liter engine puts out 161 hp.  It is higher than last years model.  Coming from a car with NO power - I can actually pass a car now.  I don't have any complaints with the power.  I'm able to go up one hill in particular at about 60mph - slowing to about 55 as I near the top.  I was lucky to hit 40-45 before.  

<b>Snow</b>:  We had about a foot of snow this past weekend.  I was very pleased the Rav4 handled so well.  No problems sliding around. I felt in control (for a change) - I was not all over the road.  I can't say enough about ABS - if it was not standard on the Rav4, we would have paid extra. I slammed on the brakes - in a safe area, of course - came to a stop (practically as if on dry pavement) with no swerving at all.  Remember - this is based on the 4 wheel drive model Rav4. 

<b>Gas Mileage</b>:  The Rav4 rates high for mileage in its class.  The Auto 4x4 rates 22city/27highway.  Its a big plus for me because I will be getting better mileage.  I was lucky to hit 22mpg in my Dodge Neon. 

<b>Cost Update</b>:
1/16/04
Total Miles:  2128.6
Total Gallons: 93.118
Total Cost: $153.94

Cost per Mile:  $0.07
Average Cost Per Gallon: $1.65 (in Connecticut)
Service Cost (Oil & Recommended Service): $0
Parts & Labor (Other than Oil & rec. service): $0

<b>Cargo</b>:
50/50 split fold rear seats - they fold up towards the front seats to give more cargo space or they can be removed.  I was very pleased with the amount of cargo space.  It was a bit difficult putting the seats back - one of the front "clips" wouldn't stay in so the seat would end up crooked.  There are directions in the door frame how to remove and put the seats back - it will get easier.  Just a little tricky.  I do like having the option of folding up the seats so I don't mind if I had to spend the time to put the seats back in the future.  It is really nice that each back seat folds down seperately so you can carry a good size load and still have a back seat passenger.  Update:  I've removed the seats several times and it is still difficult to put them back.

My thoughts on some of the options:
Leather trimmed steering wheel with Audio Controls - Not something I set out looking for but I love it now.  It will go through your pre-sets and the mode will change from AM-FM1-FM2.  Adjust your volume and forward tracks on your cds.  I would imagine the mode button also switches to the cd or audio cassette but I haven't tried yet.
 
Keyless Entry:  We did not want keyless entry - but we had never tried it before.  I don't think I would want another car without it.  One press of the unlock button unlocks the drivers door, two presses will unlock all the doors.  I love this option - it even turns the interior light on after you press the button.  

Tonneau Cover:  I was disappointed that the base model did not come with a cover.  It was a big plus that the L Model includes this.  Only complaint is it should stay up when you are taking the grocery bags out.  It has a hinge on it so you can lift it up - just doesn't stay up.
