            I bought my 1997 Chevy Lumina in November of 2000.  I have to say I love it!  I was so used to my husband's truck and this is no compairison!  It is comfortable, the seats recline, it has air conditioning, heat, power windows, power locks and the mileage was low.
The price for this vehicle is a steal!  I can not believe they sell these cars so cheap being so nice and well made.  It handles great, it drives smooth and there is plenty of room for the average size family.
The one small thing I did not like about my Lumina is the passenger side air bag, that is just my opinion though because I have heard to many bad things about air bags.
There are storage pouches in the rear of the seats for storing small items or storing activities for the kids to do on long trips.  The arm rest in the center of the front seat comes down and opens for an additional storage.  The trunk is quite large and is great for packing your belongings for trips.  The radio sounds good for a stock radio.
This car is just perfect for me and I love it!
