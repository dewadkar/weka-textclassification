            The 4th Generation Supra can't be beat!  I bought my third Supra, a 1994 Supra TT, Silver, 5-SPD, with many mods before I knew anything about the aftermarket capabilities of this car.  This is my third Supra.  I had a '84, '87, and now a '94.  I never knew that the new body styles ('93.5 to '98) were sooo sweet.  A few simple mods to the Turbos runs the car up to some serious HP output for a relatively cheap sports car.  My car dynos @ 420 HP and I paid 22,000 for it!  Try getting into a Viper or jacked up Porsche for that!  The form, fit and function also follow the Toyota tradition of excellence, but the &quot;fun factor&quot; is immeasurable.

I bought the car from a second owner in 1999 and it had 70K miles on it.  There were no interior noises, except for the thumpin aftermarket Alpine 3-CD In-Dash changer with the 10&quot; bass tube mounted in the rear. The targa top fits as tightly as it did on the car's birthday .  There were no noticeable engine problems (i.e. turbo &quot;death whine,&quot; weak clutch response or loose shift response).  Since then I have run the car up to 80K.  I drive it every day even though it is my &quot;second car.&quot;  

The stock seats are as comfy as those in any model touring sedan. My ride is a little choppy only because I strapped on OZ 18&quot; wheels and thin rubber.  The stock wheels and tires ride much smoother than one would expect from a sports car.  The power of the twin turbos can not be described.  One must sit in a Supra TT to know.  The car will go as fast as you dare, but the fun is how much quicker it moves from red-light to red-light.  Is it more fun in everday driving to be able to run 155 MPH in 4th gear (out of 6), or does the adrenaline come from reaching 50 MPH with all other traffic looking like Matchbox Cars in your rear-view?  

Go get one.  PLAY.<br><br>
