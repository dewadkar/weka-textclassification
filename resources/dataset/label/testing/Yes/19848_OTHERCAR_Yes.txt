            I purchased a 1999 Chevy S-10 XCAB within the last year.  So far it has delivered good dependable service.  Although it seems to be a little smaller inside that other small pickups I've owned, it is sufficient to meet the needs.  This particular S-10 has an automatic.  The gear shifting at times seems to have a slight jerk on fast acceleration.  Other than that, the ride is very smooth and comfortable.  It gets around 25 mpg average which for pickups, isn't bad.  Generally speaking, straight shifts tend to average a little more.  It does have a rather good sporty appeal in the cosmetics and design if this is what you're looking for. The basic stereo am/fm cassette, has good sound quaility with its 4 speaker design.  If you're wanting a good little truck to be a run about or plain have fun, for the money, it will more that meet your needs.<br><br>
