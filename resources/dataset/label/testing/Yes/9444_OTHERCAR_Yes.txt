            ***UPDATE***

13,000 MILES AND STILL GOING. NO MAJOR REPAIRS JUST OIL CHANGE. ONE RATTLE CAUSED BY LOOSE SKID PLATE SCREWS ON GAS TANK. 

This vehicle was bought because I have wanted a full size truck for sometime now.  I like the looks of the Dodge and have since they first came out with the new body line. I am not normally one who likes to buy American vehicles due to the dependability of foreign cars in this day and age.  However Dodge has a good Rep and my family has a 92 Wrangler with over 100,000 that still runs strong and never had any engine problems.

The truck is absolutely beautiful, Sleek body design and overall appearance is definitely something that manufacturers like Toyota can not compare too. For the same price you would pay for the new Toyota Tundra , if you are into looks , go with the Dodge , cause frankly the Toyota does not compare to the looks of a Dodge. The Ram is a great Truck all the way around there is nothing I don't like about my Ram.

The Ram is a large vehicle and those who are not used to driving big vehicles will feel like King of the road. Since from the drivers seat it looks as though you take up the whole lane(even though you actually don't). It handles well in corners and has a decent turn radius for a truck of its size.  The ride is relatively smooth and quite(best that should be expected for a truck).

People who are looking for a truck to ride and be as quite as a car should not buy this vehicle, as this is a truck and always will be a truck.  Someone looking for a car like ride, handling, and sound qualities, should do just that AND BUY A CAR. For those of us who want a Truck this is the one to buy. Someone who has never driven a larger vehicle may want to steer away form this too and go with maybe a midsize first as the optical illusions of the closeness between you and another vehicle can through you off. You may park behind someone and think you are on top of them, and get out to find you 2 ft away from the bumper, and 2 ft into the road behind you.

All in all this is a great truck and I recommend anyone in the market for a full size truck go ahead and take one for a test drive, I'm almost sure you'll love it.<br><br>
