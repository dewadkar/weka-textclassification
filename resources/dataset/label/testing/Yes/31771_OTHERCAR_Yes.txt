            My 323i has been a joy to drive.  It is a very fun car to drive but it is also a very safe car.  The 323 series is also very reliable.  I have not had one single major problem with it since I bought it.  I will detail the only minor problem later.

The car, when you accelerate, takes off like a rocket.   Fortunately, it also stops on a dime.  There is a new braking technology in the 323 series that works wonders.  It has been very useful and is well-worth the extra money.  The car also features eight - 8! - airbags.  Two front, two side, two back, and to &quot;curtain&quot; airbags.  They are very reassuring to have in case of an accident.

My BMW is also very comfortable.  The car (especially the seats) is very adjustable; you can put it in just the position you want.  The stereo system is also top notch, I added a CD player which I have had no problems with.

And now for my only minor problem.  It's a rattle, and a very annoying one.  After days and days of tearing my hair out trying to find the rattle, I discovered that it came from the driver's side head rest.  Now the head rest must remain down so the rattle doesn't occur.  That's the only problem - and since I usually drive the BMW alone, it isn't too bad a problem.

I have also had a problem with the air bags that keeps coming back.  One of them always seems to stop working and I have to take the car in to the shop to get it fixed.<br><br>
