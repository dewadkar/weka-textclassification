            oh MAN I LOVE THIS SUV!!!!!!!!!  I've rented them a couple of times to take long haul (14+ hours) drives packed to the gills (and I mean TO THE GILLS) with heavy boxes and I HAVE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE DRIVES!!!  Even the drive I did in a blizzard so bad that even the truckers had pulled over to the side.  It's got fabulous 4WD that got me through (and I might add in a gas-conserving manner!) and the CAVERNOUS back seat and cargo area took about 30 huge boxes without any problems. And I still had room.  I figured an SUV wouldn't be that comfortable either but it was -- amazingly so.  I actually would've been happy sleeping in the drivers seat if that had been necessary (I actually did nap in it a few times -- quite comfy!).  I was very sorry to turn it in each and every time.  And keep one thing in mind -- I had the beat up rental version when I was driving -- if you've got the babied bought for myself version how much better is it going to be?????  Like I said at the start -- if anyone would like to give me one, just tell me where to pick up the keys and title!  If I ever buy an SUV, THIS WILL BE IT.  I've driven all of them and this is the only one I've truly loved (Range Rover felt like it would tip over at 25mph in a turn; Dodge Dakota practically took a stepladder to get into; Ford Explorer couldn't make the hills with cruise control on even though it was pretty much unloaded (1 suitcase and ski gear); Lincoln Navigator had limited cargo area when the seats were in; Jeep Grand Wagoneer had minimal legroom in the backseat).<br><br>
