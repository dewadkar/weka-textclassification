            I own a 95 Passport EX 2WD Auto V6 3.2liter.
For me, it's at the margin of keeper and goner,
slightly over toward keeper.
I like the style, and the right height of 
the vehicle. Ride is a little harsh, but not
bumpy. Seat support is fairly great with a side lumber support on the front seats. The key is to keep the back pad as up right as possible for the best comfort. The rear seat is cushy enough but not wide enough to accommodate 3 child seats. It will accommodate 2 child seats apart (on both right and left sides) and leaves no space to sit in the middle. So, folks with 3 or more children, better look something else. The back space is large enough but due to the slant design of the tail gate window, the space is not as square as the other mini SUVs. But because of this slant, the tail gate window pops open without swinging the spare tire carrier out which is a little plus. (Last generation Pathfinder doesn't) The power window switch is not illuminated so I added a tiny light myself. The thing I hate the most is it's lack of power door lock "switch". You have to pull up and push down the little nob at your elbow toward the back of the door when you are inside. Get the optional Security Alarm that (at least) locks and unlocks the door locks with remote control when you are outside. Mine also lacks the intermitten wiper which would've been a great plus. And washer switch does not activate the wiper either. So You would have to push the wiper button separately. Come on, Honda, you could do better than this! (Oh sorry, Isuzu made it, right?)...

The fuel economy range is 13 to 19 mpg. Average is about 14 mpg. I took it on FWY with cruise control once to test the best fuel economy, almost using the full tank without stopping, but the result could not exceed the 19 mpg barrier. I hoped for at least 23mpg as I could well exceed it on many US made V6 3.8liter engines... It does have an inherent  problem starting in warm temperature (engine and/or high air temp). It does puff the smoke when started, but never continously. The engine eats oil a lot, due to the maldesign how it feeds the oil. It wastes about 1 quart/1500 miles. The 4spd auto tran's shift point is a little odd for the power of this vehicle. It hesitates to shift up, and changes when you are least expected, inducing a jerky drive. Most cars I tested and drove in my life (over 100cars) shift up when you relieve the pressure off the gas, but this one doesn't at lower speed. at the middle speed, it lacks the torque to push itself over the slight hill climb where it goes between the gears back and forth. It's kind of annoying to me so I normally use the "POWER MODE" for day time commuting. Using this mode will NOT increase the power, but rather delays the shift up timing, thus, being able to remain in one lower gear for a longer period until your speed is picked up for the next gear. It works better with it. 

4 wheel disk brakes and rear anti-lock brakes work fine, but the panic brake feels as if it were on ice. What's that mean? Well, it feels and stops great for a daily use, but sudden panic stop with more heavier pressure applied to the brake pedal somehow makes you feel you are on ice, and perhaps, reminds you of it's heavy weight. The Highway safety institute rates this vehicle safety "poor". So why I drive it? I like this great style, price, reliable and right size mini SUV. Explains this vehicle well. But if you like the car that you put the gas and go, don't get this. If you can do some work on yourself, and like to, then go for it. It's easy to fix and parts are fairly inexpensive considering the Honda name on it.
