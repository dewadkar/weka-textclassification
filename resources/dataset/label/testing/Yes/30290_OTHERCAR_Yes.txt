            I can't say too much about how pleased we are with this, now our second, Saturn station wagon. The first wagon, the 1997 SW1, has proven to be an extremely safe and economical all-round vehicle. I drive early in the mornings over the worst local roads for sudden icy conditions. It is very normal to see 5 cars in the ditch on the mountain pass I take to work in a short 1 mile distance when ice and fresh slush and snow hits the pass. Worse, there is almost always a semi stuck on the tightest turn. The Saturn with the excellent traction control lets me drive at very near normal speeds while others are stuck, spinning and sliding off the sides of the road, and on several occasions i have easily driven up the steepest grades from a stop after having to wait for a spinning and stopped car ahead. This pass is also heavily salted and the Saturn body has shown no deterioration, unlike my previous Honda Civic and Toyota Tercel. At 215,000 km, the 1997 is still a very smooth running and reliable vehicle, with minimal repairs (radiator, mufflers, front brakes, tires , wiper blades and oil changes) It has been given to my daughter, as i wanted to be sure she was driving a reliable, inexpensive to maintain, and safe vehicle. The new 2001 SW2 we recently purchased has the more powerful, smooth DOHC engine, air conditioning, cruise control, and we made sure we had the traction control as well.  Value is excellent for these wagons, and I only hope Saturn continues to keep the features we have come to rely on.
