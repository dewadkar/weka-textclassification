            You�ve heard all the hype and seen all the Ads, the Nissan Maxima is truly a four door sports car. You can't help but get a &quot;rush&quot;, when your behind the wheel and &quot;open it up&quot;, while driving down an open country road.

While I don�t own a Maxima, I drove my fathers brand new 1999 Maxima most of the summer.  I currently, own a Jeep and a Cirrus (see other Epinions) but after driving this car all summer, I fell in love with it.  

Ok, since It�s not my car, I�m not going to get technical and tell you about every feature that this car has to offer. What I can tell you is that the car is now 1 year old and has not been in the shop even for a dreaded recall.  The 1999 model was the last in the line before they did some redesigned for the 2000�s. (therefore, they have gotten most of the recallable issues fixed by then)

The Maxima SE comes standard with a 190-HP V6, with plenty of pep. When your on the highway and need to pass a car and quickly pull in front of the car that was on your left side, no problem. The quite engine, exerts a little extra force and you rocket by the other vehicles.

The body is sleek and on the sports model you can get a spoiler, if you into that sort of thing. Anti-lock brakes are and a performance suspension are standard too.

The interior is loaded, with bucket seats, leather rapped steering wheel, 8 speaker stereo, power everything, (seats, windows, doors locks, and sun roof)  The back is very spacious as well.  There is room for 3 adults comfortable (4 slightly squished). You can fold down one of the back seats to get access to the trunk, where you could carry large items. (ie. Skis)

Conclusion: I don�t need a new car right now, but when the time comes, I trade in my cirrus and buy a Maxima.  If you want something to compare it to, look at the Pontiac Grand Prix GT.
