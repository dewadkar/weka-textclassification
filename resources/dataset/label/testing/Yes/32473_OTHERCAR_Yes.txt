            Love my Candy Apple Red Concorde.  It is so sweet to drive, comfortable, hugs the curves on these West Virginia hills.  Oh, so smooth when changing gears automatically, never a hesitation or jerk of the car.  Interior is plush, seat backs support your back well..beautiful design, sleek looking..love the adjustable seats which are great to help keep you rested on long trips.  The antenna is built in the back window. Also the keyless entry is great.

It is easy to wash, never needs polishing as it has Clearcoat on it.  The instrument panel is compact, easy to read and easy to reach from the driver's seat.  Have 13,000 miles on it so far and have nooooo negative comments about it..Love it......Drive it..you'll buy it.<br><br>
