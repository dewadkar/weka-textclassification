            I was looking for a car to replace my 1990 Toyota Celica which I was using for the commute. I wanted something different. Something that stands out in the crowd. I needed a car that I won&#129ft be bored with after 10 years. Mini Cooper was just the car. Both my wife and I loved it. The salesman was friendly and courteous too, making the decision a lot easier. We were quite shocked when he let us test drive the car without him being on it. We were able to study the car thoroughly without being pressured and intimidated by the salesman. We decided to get the standard Red Mini, and after over month and a half of waiting, we finally got it in April. 

There's enough room in the front, but only kids and small adults in the back. The double sunroof lights up the interior well, making it feel more spacious. I have the black leather seats, and they are easy to clean. The rear seats are stiff and not meant for long rides. All seat adjustments are manual, but they are easy to use. 


[PROS]
*STYLING*
Designed without a computer, the car has the most beautiful curves. 

*FEATURES*
The Mini has excellent value. It&#129fs practically a BMW you can buy with just over 20K. It has an impressive list of safety and comfort features. 
- 6 airbags
- flat tire monitor 
- run-flat tires 
- accident sensors (turn interior lights on, unlock doors and cutoff fuel pump)
- breakaway engine (prevent engine crushing into passenger cabin in accidents)
- engine immobilizer (makes it impossible to hotwire the car)
- air conditioned glove box
- speed sensing wiper
- automatic window sealing action (makes sure the window has a perfect seal to prevent wind noise and rain from coming in)
- LATCH (ISOFIX) child seat connectors
- Auto dimming dome lights
- Remote ventilation (remotely open every window, including sunroof to vent the car)

Of course, with all these features, it means that there are more things likely to break or malfunction, but don&#129ft worry. You have the courteous BMW service manager to help you. If the car experiences a problem and the dealer is out of reach, you also have the free roadside assistance to help you. It also has a good 4yr/50k miles warranty, with 3yr/36k miles of free maintenance service. I think this is a lot for a car that costs just over 20k. 

*HANDLING*
This car handles excellently. I have the standard model, which has 115 hp. It lacks the punch, but I get decent acceleration. The 16 inch wheels has the best balance between comfort and stability. I test drove a Mini with the 17 inch rims, but the ride was so harsh, I got carsick after driving around the block. My Mini does not have the optional stability control, but the it grips the road exceptionally well on corners.  


[CONS]
*CARGO*
You can&#129ft really expect much cargo space from this car. It&#129fs barely enough for shopping at the nearby supermarket. Don&#129ft even think about picking up your friends at the airport with this car. If you need more space, just fold down the rear seats, and you&#129fll have just enough space (or length, I should say) to load in a stroller. When I need to take my baby son with me, I set him on one side and fold down the other for the stroller. 

*CUP HOLDERS*
The cup holders are barely functional. The two cup holders below the center console will only fit soda cans. Anything taller than that will hit the console. There is another cup holder in the back, which will fit most regular-sized drinks (no, not the 7-Eleven Big Gulp), but it is way too difficult for the driver to reach.  

*CHEAP PLASTIC*
There are many cheap plastic parts used in this car. The VW Beetle uses much better plastic. The silver paint used on these plastic parts can easily scraped off, so be careful with those keys. I actually bought a silver touchup paint to deal with this problem. 

*ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS*
There is an electrical problem with the Mini, which isn&#129ft surprising considering BMWs reputation with electrical problems. It is what we call the &#129gloss of power&#129h problem which occurs randomly in stop and go traffic. A malfunction (possibly a bad connection of some sort) makes the computer think that there is an engine problem. It lights up the warning lamps like a Christmas tree. As a safety precaution, the computer then limits the engine output to the bare minimum. In this condition, you can barely make 30 mph. This problem seems to be a common one, since Mini owners worldwide are experiencing it. From what I&#129fve heard, the wiring harness must be replaced to fix this. So far, there is no recall issued for this.
