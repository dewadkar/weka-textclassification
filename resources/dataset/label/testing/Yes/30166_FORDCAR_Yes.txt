            We bought our 1991 Ford Festiva new, and the &quot;Korean Komet&quot; or &quot;Red Rocket&quot; is still serving us today.  The car gets incredible mileage and almost never needs repairs, and it starts up in even the coldest of weather.  It handles well in the snow, and has an AMAZING turning radius. You could park this thing anywhere.  I guess the only downside is that if you should get hit in this thing, there's not much car to protect you.  Other than that, I think the car has a lot of personality and is a great value.  I'm a high school student and I just put a new sound system in, and now I can cruise for chicks in my sweet ride while blasting out the beach boys tunes! Woooo!<br><br>
