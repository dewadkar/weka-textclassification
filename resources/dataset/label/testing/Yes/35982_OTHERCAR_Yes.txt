            You are much more likely to have heard of the GMC Yukon Denali than the Sierra C3, but they are essentially the same vehicle.  The major difference, of course, is that the Yukon is a sports utility vehicle and the Sierra is a Full sized pickup truck. 

Inside the truck you will find an incredible number of gadgets, including an in dash 6 disk CD changer, steering wheel radio controls, OnStar, fancy upgraded leather 10 way power seats, heated seats, auto dimming mirrors, etc.  The only thing missing is automatic dual zone climate control, and an integrated GPS navigation system.

On the outside the C3 distinguishes itself from the standard Sierra with a drastically different front grill and projector beam headlights, body colored trim and mirrors, a matching tonneau cover, and chrome running boards.  

But with the C3, it is the differences that you don't see that are most important. The Vortec 6000 engine makes this the fastest full size production truck available, and the specially modified suspension gives you handling that is very surprising for a large truck.  The C3 also comes with an exclusive full time all wheel drive system that improves handling in all situations.  

I live in the lake Tahoe area and drive in heavy snow and ice most days of the winter, the C3 handles the roads with confidence, it also charges up the mountain roads without a hint of hesitation.   The C3 also comes standard with a towing package that is capable of 8700lbs, a 6' 5" bed, 4 doors and plenty of space for riders in the rear.

All in all, I am very happy with my C3 and would recommend it to anyone looking for the utility of a pickup but wants all the amenities and ride quality of a high powered luxury sedan.
