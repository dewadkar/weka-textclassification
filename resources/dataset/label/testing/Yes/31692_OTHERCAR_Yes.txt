            I got lucky once more!  This is my second Pontiac product in two decades (the last, a 1983 6000STE was/is bullet proof and is still running around town!.  I have few complaints about reliability and other very minor maintenance problems (electric window switches have been finicky) but nothing to get upset about.  The car handles adequately but is actually less fun to drive than the far older and much more primitive suspension and sprung STE I once owned.  Visibility is excellent, acceleration (not the GTP model) is good but is nothing to get overly excited about, the ride is smooth and comfortable with just enough road feel to keep the road feel through the steering wheel interesting.  The rear seat can seat three youngsters comfortably but not older teens or adults.  The trunk is spacious and there is a pass through in the middle of the back seat allowing transport of longer items in a pinch.  The body paint (mine's black) seems to be holding up extremely well under weekly car washings and twice a year waxing with Nu-Finish liquid wax.  The car is not usually garaged.

In black, this model looks meaner than it really is and stands out amongst all of the other bubble like float boats from other manufacturers out there from that model year.
For this past year, the Grand Prix body style just changed so your 98 Grand Prix, with the exception of subtleties, looks essentially like the last 2003 model.
