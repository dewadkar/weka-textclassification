            I bought my Black New Beetle about 4 months ago, and I am happy with it, not VERY happy, but happy.  The exterior has a love/hate feeling, you either love it, or you hate it.  Personally I love it.  One of my only problems with the car is its gearing.  When I am driving on the freeway I average about 80 MPH and the car is loud and its RPMs are at a little over 4000, which is not great for gas mileage.  I would really like to see next years Beetle having a better 5th gear, or possibly a 6th.  Other than that the car gets great reviews on styling.  I love the interior and it's very useful.  One thing on the interior that I would change is the fact that instead of a lever to lean the seat back it uses a crank system which takes awhile to get the seat back enough to get into a comfortable position.  Those two complaints are the only things I can think of.  Overall I would say to anyone out there that if you like the style of the car, then it is a must buy.  You won't be disappointed.<br><br>
