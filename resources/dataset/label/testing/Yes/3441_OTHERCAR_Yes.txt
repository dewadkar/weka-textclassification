            After reading the previous posts about "soul", it appears that the reviewers care more about looks than anything else.  I mean, buying a 325 over this car is silly, less room, less features, slower and more money.  But it looks "better" and therefore "feels like it handles better" etc...C'mon, get real!  I love BMW's too, but only certain models that actually justify the cost..for performance and handling, get the M3, 4wd, get the 330xi, if you have the money, M5.  But to buy a 325 over this car makes no sense, the 330i would be a much better argument since it does have a great new engine.  I think the old (E36) 3-series had more soul than the new ones because their styling was unique.  The new 3's look close to every other car out there, especially the rear resemblance to a Civic!  The only real distinguishing style point is the front BMW grill and headlights, which is unique to BMW regardless of model.

Handling:
I have owned both brands and have plenty of people I know that have BMWs, so I know what this "handling" feel is.  I admit, BMWs do handle great, no argument there.  The Type S handles great too (and my bmw friends think so).  I think there is a psychological misconception about oversteer/understeer and FWD/RWD that most people believe.  Mainly that in the real world, we don't all drive like professional race car drivers and most of us will not "power slide" our cars when we go to work.  So I argue that for 90% of the people out there, the difference in handling between this Type S and for example a 325 w/sport package isn't a significant as people think.  I know many "street racers" out there will disagree with this, but I'm arguing for the majority here.

Performance:
As many new Type S owners have found out, there is already an aftermarket that is growing for this car.  I don't mean that tomorrow you'll see every Type S with huge spoilers and stickers all over the place (I really hope not), but that a lot of owners actually want to increase the performance of an already outstanding car without making it gaudy or flashy.  Why not?  It's part of personalization and all brands have owners that customize a bit.  A 300 dollar sway kit will increase handling to even tighter, more precise control and body roll.  Stickier tires will help even more.  Headers (though 1200 bucks) will add 30hp and so on.  Plus you get 20-29 mpg still!  There isn't much to complain about here.

Exterior:
Well, I like the styling, especially the back with a spoiler.  It looks classy, understated, and smooth.  The black color is stunning (though I did not get that color due to added maintenance), the new 2002 blue color is also great (wish I got that color!).  The front could be better styled, and many owners agree.  As from a few auto shows, a simple front bumper change can make a huge difference if it bother you that much.  The side mirrors could be smaller, they can sometime block the view a bit.

Interior/Features:
Who can argue with a 6-disc In dash changer, DVD touch-screen navigation that is not only the easiest to use, but the fastest and best in class?  Add in heated leather seats, auto-dimming rear-view and heated side mirrors, right-side tilt mirror, front seats that power-slide forward/back to allow rear passengers in, standard Xenon lights, micro-filtration auto climate control, memory power seats for two keyless alarm controls, cup holders for both front and back, plenty of storage compartments, two power outlets, ski-pass through, cockpit-like gauges, a sleek sunglass holder, and a built-in HomeLink Garage Door opener (whew).  Okay I have a complaint, the cup holder isn't that great, but there's already an inexpensive part for that available.

Reliability:
Hands down Acura is awesome here.  I've had the car for almost a year with 17000 miles.  Absolutely no problems at all.  I feel such a great peace of mind when I know my car will not give me problems down the road.  I canceled my AAA roadside assistance, because the car comes with Acura TLC (Total Luxury Care) which includes this, but I'm guessing I won't need it any time soon.  My other cars (german included) were never this reliable.

What can I say, I'm hesitant to recommend this car, because I don't want to see tons of them out there, I like being unique!  When I get another car eventually, I'm going to look out for another unique, high-peformance, luxury car that won't make me pay for exclusivity.  I firmly believe you "get what you pay for", that's why I didn't buy a car like the 325.
