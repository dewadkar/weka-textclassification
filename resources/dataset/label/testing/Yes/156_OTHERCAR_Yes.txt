            What a great camera! This was such a good investment. I've always loved taking pictures, but believe me, I'm no expert. Anybody can take great pictures with this little camera. You can delete the pix you don't want to keep, re-shoot them within seconds, get rid of red eye, enlarge them, all without ever having to send your film away and paying those outrageous developing fees. That's why you always have those undeveloped rolls of film laying around for months. 
A word of advice though, send in the rebate form for the free floppy disc adaptor, and invest in the ac adaptor also, because you want to extend your battery life as much as possible.<br><br>
