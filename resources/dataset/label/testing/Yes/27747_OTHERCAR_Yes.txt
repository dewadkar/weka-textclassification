            After using a friends S100, I started looking for one myself.  I was amazed at how small it was and that it took fantastic pictures.

It is a bit pricey (as are comparable digital cameras) but at around $400 it is not cost prohibitive.  I found mine online for about $390 +shipping.

Once it got here, I was amazed at how easy it was to use once you have read the instruction manual.  I recommend reading it cover to cover (in your language, there are several) before using the camera. 

I originally took a few pictures in the default (hi-res) mode and found that the memory card (a mall 8mb) filled up in 4 pictures.  Since it is a 2 megapixel camera, this made sense and the pictures were fantastic, but too large to share over anything but a broadband connection. 

Lately I have been using medium-res mode and the pictures are still very clear but the file sizes are a good bit smaller (around 750k) and do not fill up the card quite as quickly.  

Lo-res mode should be sufficient for most applications and might make it unnecessary to purchase a larger compact flash card.  I went the bigger route and ordered a 128 mb card in case I can't do a download in the middle of the action being photographed.

The included software is easy to use and fairly intuitive.  If you mess around with it for a few minutes, you should be able to get it to empty the camera to the computer with no trouble. 

The USB connection is FAST and much easier to use than the Kodak DC210 that I had used previously.  A 750k file takes 2 to 3 seconds to download.  

Overall, I really like it and would buy another one if I had a use for it.
