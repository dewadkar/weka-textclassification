            It's no mystery why this is my second Accord coupe!  Over the 2 and 1/2 years I drove my '97 Accord EX, I took it to the shop only for oil changes and scheduled maintenance.  It never stalled, sputtered, or ran erratically.  It was economical and a blast to drive with a VTEC engine, 5 speed, and 4-wheel disc brakes.  

When my lease was up, I researched many alternatives in terms of performance, features, safety, and cost.  It was only logical that I pick up a 2000 Accord EX Coupe.  It is better in nearly every way than the pre-1998 style it replaces.  Its V6 engine has 50 more horsepower and 50 more lb/ft of torque, generated by a VTEC engine with 2 more cylinders than the old 4.

So far I have found handling to be at least comparable to my '97-The car feels a bit heavier in turns, but I have yet to be startled by any hidden flaws in dynamics.  Accelaration has improved noticeably from the 4 cylinder days.  The additional v6 torque contributes to a buttery smooth package in this coupe.  This car is quiet and smooth at speeds that would have you incarcerated in 49 states! Stopping power feels stronger than before.  The 4 wheel disc brakes are great in stop &amp; go traffic. 

The '99 model car rates 4 out of 5 stars in most crash test safety categories posted by the NHTSA. For 2000, the V6 Coupe with leather comes with driver and passenger side airbags built into the seats. 

The interior design is excellent.  Everything is in easy reach for the driver.  Electronic climate control, homelink transmitter, and steering-wheel audio controls minimize driver distraction and maximize driving enjoyment.  

About the only thing I dislike about the car is the lack of a standard transmission option for V6 models.  Not that the 4-speed computer controlled automatic isn't smooth.  I usually prefer the control and fun factor of a stick, and I have always owned manual shift model cars.  
In fact, a couple of years ago I said &quot;I'll never drive/own anything but a stick&quot;  
Well, the rest of the package is so sweet I overcame that aversion!  
Test drive one and you'll know what I mean...   <br><br>
