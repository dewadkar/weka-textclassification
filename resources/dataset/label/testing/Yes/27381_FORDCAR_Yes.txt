            I received my truck back in June and already have put 12k trouble free miles on it.  It has proven itself on a number of backpacking/biking/hiking trips.  I was initially considering the Sport Trac as well, but chose the SuperCrew because of the bigger bed (no need for an extender to carry bikes), and the more spacious interior.

This truck has been used off-road a number of times to access various remote locations and has shown itself to be very capable in both 2 wheel and 4 wheel drive modes.  I recently drove for nine hours to Maine, and found it to be the most comfortable vehicle in which I have taken a major road trip.  I am still surprised at how quiet the ride is in this truck.

The interior, with the split folding rear seat, has been very adaptable depending on my needs.  I have used it to carry five large adults comfortably, (I have the front bench seat, but have not used the center location as of yet).  It has carried me and my backpacking equipment very easily.  There have been a number of biking treks with up to four people, bikes, and equipment being transported comfortably and safely.

I immediately added a bedliner after receiving the truck.  It was a nice complement to the sufficiently sized bed,  (I do wish that there were stake holes in the bed rails).  The bed has been used to haul bikes, mulch, and furniture with not difficulties encountered.

Some other pluses have included the fog lights which have performed well when needed, (I drive the Palisades Parkway in NJ/NY which is often shrouded in fog).  The moon roof is large and functions effortlessly.  I have the towing package, but have not towed anything yet, (I see a pop-up camper in my future).  I have and recommend the side steps for easy access, (I have the running boards which also protect the sides from car doors in parking lots).

My only slight disappointments would be the minimal amount of storage behind the rear seat, and the sound quality of the audio system which pales in comparison to those found in Ford's Explorers, (I replaced it with an aftermarket system).

Overall I love the truck.  It has performed better than any vehicle that I have ever owned.
