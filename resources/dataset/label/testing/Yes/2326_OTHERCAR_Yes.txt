            I mainly bought this product so I could take some photos at amusement and theme parks around the country for my website. I had price compared a lot of different cameras, and this seemed to be a great one to fit my tastes. One of the main problems with the camera is the battery life when used with the flash. The flash brings down the battery life like no tomorrow, so try not to use the flash when you may not need to. 

Another annoyance is the &quot;battery meter&quot;. It shows full, half, and none. It would be a little more helpful if it gave a more precise representation, but that is just a minor flaw that will most likely not bother many others. I have taken other types of photos, like at our school gym during a pep rally. Not one of my photos turned out well inside our gym because of the lighting inside of it. Other digital cameras used that day worked fine, but mine just couldn't cut it so everything turned out blurry even when held still. This only seems to happen in poor lighting, because I can easily take pictures off of roller coasters going more than 80 MPH and they are crisp and clear as long as itï¿½s a sunny day out. I really love that I can take professional photos and spread them to the world.  

The memory card that came with it (8 MB's) fit my needs fine since I don't need to take high resolution photos for my website. The settings include the &quot;quality&quot; rated with 1, 2, or 3 stars, and than low or high resolution. You can get over 100 photos easily with an 8 MB card at lowest resolution, with photos looking &quot;decent&quot;, although I would not recommend using low resolution for printing. The USB cable allows super fast transformation to the computer compared to the slow serial port I used before I got before my new computer. 

My favorite feature is the fact that you can delete a picture you took instantly by pressing the &quot;trash can&quot; button, without going into &quot;play mode&quot; and deleting it there. I like this much better than other cameras I have used. 

This camera is definitely a bang for your buck, and will suit many of your needs. Many of my complaints probably wouldn't apply to the average user so I recommend you get it. You will not be disappointed with this digital camera.<br><br>
