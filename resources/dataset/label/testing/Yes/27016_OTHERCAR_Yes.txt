            This past Christmas I was pleasantly surprised to see the Olympus 450-Zoom under my tree.  For the past year or so, I have wanted a digital camera, but was never able to afford one that would give decent resolutions and options that made me happy.  This camera, however, met and surpassed all my expectations!

First of all, the camera is very pleasing to the eye.  It is not too big, not too heavy and the LCD screen is really big for the size of the camera.    Another nice feature is the optical zoom.  A lot of cameras talk about the amazing zoom that it has, but the cheaper models rely on digital zooming.  Although useful, digital zooming quickly degrades as you go in closer.  Optical zooming allows you to zoom in without the degradation of picture quality.  The Olympus 450-Z comes with 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom.  The combination of the two allows you to close in on any part of a picture.

The camera is loaded with different shutter speeds so that you are able to capture all the memories you want in any conditions.  The LCD screen is always a joy because it allows for instant gratification and the ability to quickly see that the shot came out poor and redo it if necessary.

The multitude of different flashes also make another nice feature for this camera.  It has normal, red-eye reduction, fill-in, and a combo of red-eye and fill-in.  These four different flashes cover almost any lighting needs of the casual shutterbug.

The feature that most people are concerned about and rightly so is the picture resolution.  The 450-Z has three different levels of resolution: normal quality, high quality and super-high quality.  Normal quality is approximately 640x480 resolution, perfect for web pages.  The next two levels are very comparable to 35mm clarity for photos.  I normally keep the camera at HQ (high quality) because it offers the best quality and still allows me to put a decent amount of pictures on a 8MB smartmedia card.

The downside of the camera are the controls.  The are really confusing.  Everything is represented by graphics.  Now, if you know what each symbol means then this is great, but most casual photographers don't know or don't remember every little symbol.  Fortunately, most people will not have to fiddle with the settings unless they want to take some speciality shots.<br><br>
