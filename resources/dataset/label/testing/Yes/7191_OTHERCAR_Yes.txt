            We purchased this car after recovering from all I can describe as a car disaster.  We previously owned a Audi.  After two tranmissions went out we were ready for a more reliable car.

We first noticed a Maxima while on vacation.  We took the opportunity to rent it and fell in love immediately.  It drove nice.  It looked nice.  It had the power my husband requires and it had a good record.

After we got rid of our lemon we were determined to get a maxima.  We wanted one with lower miles so we settled for a GXE.  This has not been a disadvantage.  It may not have leather but the interior of the car is very attractive and nice.  

There are several things I love about this car.  First of lets face it it looks great.  That matters to me a lot.  It looks stylish.  It drives like a dream.  It has lots of power and can accelerate quickly without jerky shifts or long delays.  It has been reliable.  Nothing has broken or needed to be fixed other than regular scheduled tune ups.  This car has a lot of room and fits people who are tall comfortably.  Other sedans can be more tight.  

My babies car seat fits in the safe and secure.  I feel confident that the car is safe and will protect us in a accident.

This car will not disapoint anyone with its classy look, practical features, and safe design.  Even the speed demon in the family will find he has a sporty car in a sedan!<br><br>
