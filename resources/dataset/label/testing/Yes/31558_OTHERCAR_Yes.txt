            I remember the day I bought my 1985 Volvo 240 (DL). I had called up a guy who'd advertised it in the paper, and my dad and I went over to his house. We drove it around the block a few times, and my dad told me it was a good, safe car. I felt like a grandmother driving around in a boat, but I knew my dad wasn't up to searching around town for used cars with me, so I let myself be convinced. My hands shook when I wrote out the check - $1400 for a wagon with 140,000 miles. It was the biggest check I've written to date. When I got home, I cried. I had wanted a CRX. But I had bought a long, skinny station wagon. 

However, throughout the past two and a half years, I've grown to love my Volvo 240. Even though it's recently given me a lot of trouble (the alternator and battery went within a few months of each other), I still feel I made a sound purchase. I feel relatively safe driving it. Unlike my previous car (a 1986 Pontiac 6000), the Volvo always starts on the first try. It doesn't stall when you accelerate from a stopped position. Its paint job isn't prone to peeling off, and its skinny frame is advantageous in tight parking positions.

But the car is starting to age. There's rust inside the doors and along the underside of the wheel wells. In addition, I get horrific gas mileage. For awhile I was getting 12 miles to the gallon. The going theory was that it wasn't shifting into fourth gear. Now it gets higher mileage, possibly because I've had some work done on it.

But speaking of gears, one piece of advice: Make sure you don't accidentally knock the shifter into 2nd gear and unknowingly drive 150 miles at 60+ mph. It really messes things up.

Interior-wise, mine has leather seats, which seem fairly common from what I've seen in other Volvos. Many passengers don't find my car comfortable to ride in. I don't care, because I don't find it uncomfortable to drive in. But it might be something you want to keep in mind.

A few other problems: 
� Extremely loud air conditioning.
� Noisy at high speeds, noisy over bumps.

Again, this stuff doesn't bother me, because I don't use air-conditioning and I'm used to driving old rattle-y cars, but it might bother you.

Another plus, though, is that the Volvo also has a great deal of space. When the back seats are flipped down, a twin-sized mattress fits perfectly in the back. I know this because I transported my bed to college in this car, not because of any illicit activity. But that should give you a good size of the length and width of storage space. Space is definitely a strong point in this vehicle.

All in all, I am impressed by the reliability of the Volvo 240. I don't know how many more miles it has in it, but I expect to drive it until it dies, and I don't really expect that to happen any time soon.
