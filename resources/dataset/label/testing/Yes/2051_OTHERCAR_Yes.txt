            My husband and I are first time GMC purchasers and I can say we are not disappointed. When looking for and SUV were looking for durability , power and size. The Yukon was perfect. It offered power and size without being overwhelming. We had looked at the Yukon XL . However we asked ourselves &quot;why do we really need all this room?&quot;. We found that the Yukon comfortably sat 4 adults and 2 children. The interior is luxurious without being so luxurious you are afraid to bring food in the car.(This was and issue when we compared it to the Cadillac.) The ride is smooth and quite. The cargo space is more than what we need.
The only down fall of the Yukon is that the pickup isn't quite what we expected( but then again are other car is a Saab--BIG difference) Also the brakes tend to be &quot;mushy&quot;. Another thing to take into consideration is the size of your garage. Are two car garage is now a one car. The length is not the issue. the truck is very wide.<br><br>
