            Just by looking at this vehicles name, it's obvious to see that Nissan is targeting a specific demographic.  Not that this is a bad practice, but I think those generation X'ers out there may do good to not be blinded by marketing.  

First off, let me say, I don't own an Xterra, nor do I think this is an overly poor vehicle.  I was in the market for a new SUV about 2 months ago, and did extensive research on all sorts of makes and models, including 4 Runners, Pathfinders, Xterras, Monteros, CR-V's, Rodeos, and Passports.  

I will admit I was smitten by the Xterra at first, with it's slick advertising, and unique body style.  I was almost sure I was going to buy one of these until I test drove it.  Then I started opening my eyes.  If you look closely, the Xterra looks very much the pickup with a built on shell that it is.  

Basically, the exact frame and engine as the Nissan Frontier pickup (I believe that's the model).  Not that this is bad, but the Xterra handles like a pickup first and foremost.  Nissan tries to market this SUV as a lower end of their SUV pricing, behind Pathfinder, but once you get the thing with all the options, you are looking at a sticker well above 25k, especially with the generation X demand for this vehicle.  

The interior is VERY sparse, meaning their really aren't any bells and whistles, just your very basics.  The sunroof only comes in the 'pop up' style, and is partially blocked by the roof rack.  This seems very odd to me.  The steering was very loose, and the brakes not terrible responsive.  

Overall, I didn't hate this vehicle, I just hated myself for being swayed by slick, gimmicky marketing (You know, the Xterra comes with a built in first aid kit? Wow. And option kayak mountings. Woohoo.)  I'm just saying do your homework before buying one of these.  I'm glad I did, and ended up with a more powerful, much better stocked SUV, for a few thousand less. (See my review on the Honda Passport.)
