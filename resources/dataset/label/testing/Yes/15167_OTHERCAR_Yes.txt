            First of all i just have to say:
Before purchasing this wonderful camera, i read the reviews that people posted on this page. I wanted to see what was the overall opinion of this camera. Many have complained saying that is gives them problems, but after reading what the problems were, i had realized that it wasnt the actual camera, but other things that had caused the problems.

I bought the camera, and i must say i have never been more pleased. I used to own am AGFA CL30 Clik! and wasn't pleased at all.. so that is why i decided a change. 
The main reason i need a digital camera is because i take pictures for a website. Mainly, the pictures are of parties (in the dark) during the night. I needed a camera that takes great quality pictures, even in the night time. The PDR-M60 was exactly what i was looking for! I read reviews where people have complained that the camera has a "low flash", which is completely untrue. This camera has different flash settings, including a night feature, which takes bright and clear pictures even in LOW light! 
Another great thing that i have noticed is that you can take black and white pictures. This makes it more fun and interesting to explore the different picture styles. I already took a B&W photo of my puppy, and let me tell you its the cutest picture ever!
The camera itself is pretty small. Its easy to hold, and comes with a neck strap. I wish it had came with an AC adapter, but those can be purchased for like $12 at RadioShack so its not a problem.
I have seen that many have complained about the USB cable and said that it doesnt work. Mine works just fine! I just think something is wrong with those peoples' USB Ports on their computer, and that is why they have problems with it. I have already transfered many pics onto my computer and the USB cable works just fine. Pictures get transfered very quickly too!
The camera should have a soft case just to protect the LCD.. the is probably the only complaint i have other than the AC adapter. I bought a 64MB smartmedia card for $33.00 online, so i didnt really mind the fact that the camera came with a 4MB card.
I have a NiHM rechargable battery pack that i have used from my other camera, and i suggest using something like that just so you can have enough battery. I take pictures all night long at parties, and i need enough battery to handle the all night usage.

I really recommend this camera! you wont be disappointed! after you have it for a while, make sure you play around with the different settings that it has to be sure that it works the way you want it. This camera can also be UPGRADED!!! You just go online and upgrade it yourself! I am glad i had purchased it, and for the price i got it for, i think it was MORE than worth it!
