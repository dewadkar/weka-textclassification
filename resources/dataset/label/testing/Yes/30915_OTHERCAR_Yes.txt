            I, too, picked up this camera from Compusa for $99 after rebate after doing extensive research online. Overall I've been very pleased with the picture quality, and I don't regret buying the camera, but I do have two major gripes: the battery life is fairly short, and is shortened even more anytime the camera is accidentally turned on. Because the on-switch is a dial located on the top of camera, it can easily be bumped from the off position into either picture taking mode, or the really battery-draining picture viewing mode. Although you can set the camera to automatically turn off after 2 minutes, anytime it's bumped into an on position, I find the batteries are almost completely drained. The only other problem I've found is that pictures are blurry anytime you don't use the flash. It isn't a question of light, if you use the flash outdoors on a sunny day, you get a sharp, clear picture, and if you don't, the picture is usually out of focus. That's really too bad, because it's got pretty cool night vision, and taking a picture at night without the flash reveals a more brightly lit seen than that seen by the human eye (but the result is blurry). My only other advice has to do with the memory card: the card that it comes with is only 8MB, which only gives you about 15 pictures at the highest quality setting. For $30, I picked up a 48MB card at Compusa and use the 8MB as a back-up (I haven't used the 8MB card yet, because the 48MB card stores about 79 pictures at the highest quality setting). The last thing I would note is that the software for viewing the pictures is excellent in my opinion and better than Microsoft's Picture It.
