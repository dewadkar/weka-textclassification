            Could there be a perfect automobile that bridges the chasm of luxury tourer, nimble sports car, and practical daily driver?  Probably one day.  For today though this may be it.  I have 30,067 miles on the clock so far, and everytime I take the car out for a spin im sold all over again on my choice of this car.  I catch myself peering into the parking lot at times just to admire the car's lines from a far.  I'm confident with each person I introduce this car to that they will not be disappointed, and I hope I can sum up why...

It's impossible to look at any of the 1998-2002 W208 CLK styling without admiring it's muscular lines and athletic stance.  
Sit inside and you find yourself surrounded in quietly stated luxury.  Leather and black birds eye maple, (Burlwood depending on your interior color choice, mine is charcoal or black) chrome accents, and polarized blue tinted glass surround you in a cabin that leaves the world outside and is completely devoid of whistles, creaks and wind noise.  Gauges are thoughtfully laid out and easy to read, and though a tilt wheel would offer driving positions perfect within a micron, Mercedes has done an excellent job with its telescopic wheel.  The automatic climate control not only does an excellent job at maintaining cabin temperature, but it's whisper quiet as well.  The Bose stereo is superb.  With steering wheel controls tending after an in trunk 6 CD changer, AM/FM & Weatherband radio, Cassette (and in some cases the optional integrated cell phone) you won't even entertain the thought of changing out this unit and losing the steering wheel functionality.  Lights, wiper controls and a separate stalk for the cruise control functions are equally as easy to locate and use without taking your hands off the wheel ... this you'll appreciate.  The 430 with its 275 BHP and 295 Ft/lbs of torque can be a handful. (Side Note: In the hands of a knowledgable MB tech, your car can soon be offering close to 300BHP)  Even with it's 245/40ZR17 High Performance rear tires, putting the power to the ground requires the ESP traction control program. Or you'll just spin a tire at every corner without even hearing the chaos your causing outside. I like to refer to the Benz as a 1970 Chevelle SS in a tuxedo.  Stomp on the gas from a stoplight and your destined to leave a Pirelli tattoo on the road behind you.  If your truly daring you'll turn off the Electronic Stability Program or ESP(on a perfectly DRY sunny day) if only to see what the monster under the hood looks like in glaring daylight.  Be prepared to lose a few thousand miles worth of tread off your tires. On the highway the car drives in dead silence, broken only by the sound of the exhaust when you decide to pass slower traffic.  
 
With it's 105.9" wheelbase it's just long enough to soak up bumps, train tracks and the impurities of Anytown, USA while still being short enough to facilitate quick turns and offer rollercoaster handling.  While many purist's complain of the recirculating ball steering that MB engineers chose, I have no complaints and don't feel that road feel and feedback is muted in any way,  but everyone has their own opinions.  Though not as twitchy as Japanese import racers, or pure form Porsche's, the steering is light enough to throw the car around for fun and/or obstacle avoidance, and heavy enough to allow the CLK to track straight on residential roads with a minimum of effort.  Highways rutted from heavy trucks are another story altogether and one to pay some mind too as well.  With the huge 45 series front and 40 series rears, this car finds and tracks the lines cut by heavy interstate trucks.  Look away to reach for a phone, or check a map and you could be off the road.  This car is good, OK great, but it does require your attention.  I speak from experience, as I drove nearly 1160 miles the first week returning from the dealer I purchased the car from.  I don't plan on, and couldn't even imagine driving it in foul weather, be it sleet or snow.  For me this will be for fun only, garaged except for sunny days.
 
Creature comforts abound, the large glass moonroof, express up and down driver & passenger windows, separate heating and cooling controls, and programable memory 10 way adjustable seats provide a near perfect driving (or being driven) experience.  The massive trunk is more than ample for an airport run, and it only gets larger by folding down the 60/40 rear seats.  Speaking of seats again, The fronts are a little firm for anyone not used to MB.  The rear seats ARE comfortable enough for two adults (as long as they aren't six footers).  Short and medium length trips are not out of order for 4 adults, kids aren't even an issue.  Opt for the lumbar support if this is going to be your daily driver, you'll be glad you did.  Safety features like ABS, ESP (Traction Control) and front and side airbags give a nice feeling of security.  Brakes are probably the best from any car I've driven.  Mercedes really nailed this one.  The pedal gives nice feel, the ABS is inspiring, especially if you start to feel that you might have gotten into a high speed corner a little over your head.  After driving in an AMG sponsored driver training and racing program I can attest that the brakes held up fade free for a full day of torturous braking (and it was 100 F out as well!)
 
Is there a wish list?  In short yes, but it remains exactly that, a wish list.  I wish I got more than 19/25 mpg, but a day of thrilling driving is still cheaper then the cost of a lift ticket, even with the premium gas requirement.  I wish I had tilt steering, I dont understand a $52K price tag without it, BUT finding a great driving position with the 10 way power seats and telescoping steering column isn't too difficult.  I wish the exhaust note were a little more distinct inside the car too, I guess I'll just have to enjoy it with the windows down summertime.  I wish the car didn't attract so much attention, which causes me to park in the rear of parking lots, usually on the end of lanes to further cut down the chance of someone parking next to me (did I mention I'm a little paranoid about dings and dents LOL).  I wish I could get gas without standing around talking to car guys about it.  But then again... I'm also happy about the attention.  It's nice to be recognized for owning a nice car, to have something that attracts casual glances as well as "car guy stares."  For me it seems this is the perfect car.  It can haul the kids to soccer, take you out for an elegant night on the town, run with the fastest, handle with the quickest, and after hard day when you just want to revisit the hot rod teenage years and put a quick smile on your face, there are plenty of horses in the stable to vaporize some rubber.
