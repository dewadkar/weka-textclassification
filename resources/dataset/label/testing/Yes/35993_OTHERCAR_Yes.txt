            I bought my 92 SVX LSi in 1992 and still have it with around 95,000 miles on it.  I love this car.  It is still going strong and the ride is still very good, quiet and the car has been reliable.  

Other than routine maintenance, the car has not required much attention.  Alas, I think we will be selling the car next year.  We now have a family and need more room.  The positive side to this is that we have had enquiries as to when we were going to sell the car from two people already.

When I talk to the mechanics at the dealership, all of them are looking for the SVX.  Apparently, very few SVX's actually make it out to the used car lot.  The mechanics snap them up whenever they are traded in.

The car is stylish, comfortable, has unique amenities like auto down AND up, climate control, cool windows, power, AWD...  I go out and have fun when the weather forecast says blizzard and everybody else stays home.

The AWD in the snow is great.  A few guys have asked me to bring the car out to autocross.  I just might on a rainy day.  If you have never driven AWD in bad weather, please try it.  You are in for a treat.  Try crossing a slushy snowbound intersection and you'll know why it is so great.  When the front wheels start sliding, the back pushes you on.  when the back starts sliding, the front pulls you out.  This makes for very simple and uneventful passage through a treacherous intersection.

If you are adventurous, blip the throttle in a turn and watch the tail come out and gradually pull itself back in line without any sudden corrections required.

With a 3.3L engine and 230 HP, this car also will surprise some cars at the traffic light.  It is too heavy to chuck around, but very comfortable and capable of cruising seemingly forever on the highway.  Too bad they decided not to make this with a manual.

Highway mileage is around 26 MPG.  City mileage has been pretty consistently around 17 MPG on 93 Octane.

This is not your typical Subaru.  With 8 years and 95K+ miles, we are still on the original mufflers (some seals have been replaced).  Amazing.  I'd love to get the new Legacy, but we need more space :(<br><br>
