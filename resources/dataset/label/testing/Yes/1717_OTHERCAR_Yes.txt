            When I wife and I were looking to replace her VW Cabriolet (wasn't a happy day - convertibles and infants don't mix well!) we were looking for a AWD vehicle.  

At the time, I had a Suzuki Sidekick and really enjoyed how it felt in the snow.  I would have bought another Sidekick, but I wanted something that felt a little more secure, and had a bigger interior.

We had two choices: the CR-V or the RAV-4.  Both of us like the looks of the RAV-4 better, but the CR-V was a bit less expensive and has more interior space. 

We bought the CR-V (of course, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this review!).

We've had it over 3 years, and I don't believe we've had it in the shop for anything yet (except for an aftermarket sun roof we put in).  It has been very reliable, gets descent gas mileage, and is fun to drive.

I really like how the steering feels: nice and tight.  Plus, the turning radius is pretty amazing - it can turn on a dime (well - a big dime).

I was a little disappointed at the performance in snow.  It certainly is better than a FWD, but it isn't as good as my Sidekick was, or even my AWD Grand Caravan (that surprised me quite a bit!)

The goods:
- very reliable
- good gas mileage
- great turning radius

The bads:
- not as good in snow as expected
- not as big as I would have liked 
- slow pickup
- driving can get uncomfortable during a long drive (my wife put in some additional support on the driver's seat)
