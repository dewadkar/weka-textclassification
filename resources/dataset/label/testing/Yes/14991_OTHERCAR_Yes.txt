            I purchased this model because I wanted something very easy to use and at the same time gave a quality picture. All my research on which one to buy led me to go for the 10 x optical lens over a higher digital lens for picture quality.

 The only downside of this camera is the lessor pixel than more expensive models give. The plus side is the easy and fast way of downloading the photo's into the computer.

 As a new computer user, this was the biggest and best feature this camera had to a person who is not real adept at this sort of thing. If I take a picture I am not happy with, I can delete it. I also get anywhere from 36 to 40 pictures on a regular floppy disk, and thus do not have to take up my hard drive space with photo's unless i want them placed in an album. 

I really didn't have the money for a high dollar camera yet, but have been very pleased with the results I have gotten so far with this camera. It is so easy to email pictures to family and friends as well. 

I don't think the quality is as good as I get with my 35 mm. when printed out, but it wasn't one of the better models either so have to expect that I think. I travel in my work and take this camera with me at all times and found it to be very useful in so many ways. I would highly recomend this camera to anyone, especially if you want something easy to operate. It is the best.<br><br>
