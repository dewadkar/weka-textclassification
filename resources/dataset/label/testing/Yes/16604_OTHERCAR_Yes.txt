            I bought my 1995 Mitsubishi 3000gt in 1999 for an awesome deal of $14,775.  It only had 30,000 miles.  Mine is an SL and I have all the options including custom chrome rims.  The car rides and runs like a dream with the 5-speed trans.  I would recommend this car to anybody.  I have never had any problems what so ever.  Anyone who screws up the trans in this car must really beat on it bad because I have never had a problem.  And believe me, I am hard on the car sometimes.  My Dad has a 300zx and I feel that the 3000gt drives much better.  The front wheel drive is great in the winter and the car is quick.  What do you expect from 222 h.p.  It's not a vr4.  The car has the best pick up I've ever seen for a standard v-6 engine.  This is truly a magnificent car in all aspects.  I don't know how other people drive but my Mitsubishi gets 350 miles to the tank in city driving.
