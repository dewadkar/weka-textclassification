            I actually happened upon the Malibu by default and am so glad I did.  I have always driven luxury foreign vehicles - my last one being a Infinity G-20 which was probably the only lemon they ever made!  Someone sent me down to a GM dealership to look at a used Lexus that had been recently traded.   Right beside it was this beautiful pearl white, with tan leather Malibu LS.   I asked about it, drove it and immediately fell in love.  I thought that American cars were inferior but this peppy car not only drives live a dream but handles like a sports car.  

The leather interior wraps around me and everyone who rides in it is pleasantly surprised.  I particularly love the cup holders in the front and the back.  The best surprise of all, however, was the dealership.  Shortly after I purchased the vehicle, I accidently locked my keys in the car with the car running.  (A another story for another time!)  I called the dealer and they came right out and got me into my vehicle and did not charge me anything.  Now that is service.  This car must truly be the American Dream Car of the 90's!<br><br>
