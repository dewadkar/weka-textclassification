            This car is excellent for short people.  I am 4�10 and able to reach all controls with ease.  At the same time, tall people are comfortable in the car.  The knobs and dials are large and easy to use.  The sunroof is a nice feature.  When open the sunroof makes very little noise.  Having no �hump� in the back seat floorboard allows more foot room back seat passengers.  The trunk is spacious.  It fits my wheelchair with plenty of room left over.

Gas mileage is very good.  I�m getting approximately 400 miles on 11 gallons.  The get-up-and-go is low.  Which is explained by the 4-cylinder engine.  I estimate it will do 0 to 60 in 12 seconds.  Personally, I don�t mind sacrificing a little power and thus saving money at the gas pump. 

I was pleased with my service at Conyers Honda.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The office and bathroom was clean and ultra modern.  We struck a good deal with almost no haggling.  It came it a 36,000 mile or 3 year warranty.
