            I've just had my V6 EX Coupe for a few weeks, so I'm still learning the pleasures of owning such a vehicle. I must confess this is the first Honda and first sport coupe I've owned. Going from a luxury American four door sedan to this vehicle wasn't difficult for me. The primary selling point of a Honda is its reliability, low depreciation and unique style.

For starters the 2003 Coupe offers the buyer that head-turning "what is that" second look. It differs from the 2002 coupe, in that the vehicle forsakes it's more angular older sister and goes for a visually challenging roundness with some sharp angled wrap-around lights for a stunning effect. The car looks fast when standing still. For those that want to sharpen the bubble effect of the vehicle a little more and to make the appearance look sportier I recommend adding a spoiler. Get it after-market as an OEM part through a reputable aftermarket supplier, you'll save hundreds.

The start stop response is pin point accurate, with the four wheel ABS system the sensitivity will take some getting used too, especially if you&#146re breaking in the cars first few hundred miles. For safety you couldn't ask for better response. If responsive speed is your thing, you'll love the V6. Quick acceleration is the name of the game in this baby and no problem delivering that extra power when you need to pass... even up hill.

Coming over from a large four-door sedan I thought I'd be giving up the luxury of trunk space and interior space. Not so, the trunk space is ample and since the back seat can fold down giving you even more, it puts larger vehicles to shame. I also love the lower lip design of the truck. Not having so far to go, when picking up heavy articles such as suitcases, is a blessing. The interior for a sports coupe is surprisingly spacious, usually the back seats of a sport coupe has little to no leg room and if you weigh over 125 and/or your height is over 5.10 forget it, not the case here. The seats are settled in with a slight elevation for the legs so they're fairly comfortable. Yes, it's a trick getting in and out, but it's a sports coupe. The two front bucket style seats wrap you in, much like cock-pit seats in a jet, very comfortable even without programmable lumbar support.

Now to the Cons... and these are very minor. An improvement could be made to the door locks. When getting out of the vehicle, most vehicles will automatically unlock when pulling the door handle... not this one. You must manually unlock the door or hit the lock/unlock button. 

Next, coming from a luxury sedan the headlights were automatic. Information feeding off of a sensor, would turn the lights on and off automatically. Also, you didn't have to worry about turning your lights off when leaving the vehicle. When you think about it, most alarm clocks now-a-days have a built in light sensor, so this wouldn't be all that difficult to add to the vehicle. This would be a nice feature or add-on for the LX,EX models. However manually turning on and off your lights is a very minor inconvenience at best.
