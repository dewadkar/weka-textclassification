            I bought my 1999 Chevy Lumina in May 2000, after a drunk hit and run driver totalled my 1991 Buick Regal.  I got the Lumina because it was most similar to my '91 Buick, which I was truly in love with. When I got the Lumina it was in near pristeen condition with 29,000 miles (warranty is to 36,000.)  I paid $12,500 which was a very reasonable price indeed.

My Lumina has a 3.1 liter fuel injected V6, which gives me around 29 mpg, a little less with the A/C going. When I first bought the car I was a little disappointed in the power of the engine, but I started using mid grade 89 octane gas and the performance improved greatly, although the Chevy is still no match for my old Buick which had the same engine but a different transmission. Also, the Lumina is a little heavier than the Buick.

Chevrolet says the Lumina is a 6 passenger vehicle. They mean six adults, but it would be like sardines in a can.  Admittedly, we are big people, but I think six slim adults would be very snug in this car.  We have two kids' car seats in the back and there's about 10 inches of space between them.

As for the mechanics of the Lumina.....it's a solid, well built, reliable, safe car.  The Lumina has a long history of excellence.

It's also a very smart car.  Mine has the PasskeyII anti-theft system, which involves a resistor chip in the ignition key that allows the car to start.  You can set the stereo volume to automatically adjust to the speed of the car, the faster, the louder. This is especially nice in the summertime when you have the windows down. When you stop at a redlight the stereo volume turns itself down so it's not so loud now that the wind isn't blowing.

Another nice thing about all the safety features of my Lumina is that it saved me a bundle on my auto insurance. The PasskeyII alone saved me 20%! It also has airbags, antilock brakes, daytime running lights, and rear door child locks.

Other features on my car include automatic transmission, electronic windows, side mirrors, and doorlocks, cruise control, wiper delay (which is too fast at the lowest setting), rear window defroster, A/C, AM FM cassette, headlights come on automatically at dark (or when you pull under the drive through canopy at the bank), reclining front seats, map lights on the rear view mirror, dual vanity mirrors on the visors, plus more I won't bore you with. Oh yeah, if you go off and leave your door open, don't worry about the dome light running your battery down.  All the cabin lights (and there are plenty) turn themselves off after several minutes(20-30 I'm not sure).  

<b>Changes I would like to see in the Chevy Lumina</b>
A tighter turning radius....
About a six inch wider cabin....
Bigger, deeper seats....
Less road noise at highway speeds....
A sportier transmission....
On/off switch on the dome light....
Quieter tires....
Steering column with length adjustment....
Rear cup holders....
No noticeable engine pull when turning on the A/C....
A better sounding speaker arrangement....
