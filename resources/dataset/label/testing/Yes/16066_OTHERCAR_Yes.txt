               Recently our family purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  The family was surprised one day when it showed up at our garage door.  It was a total surprise and I was thrilled to get it.  I had been wanting a SUV for a long time now.  
   
   I hoped into the car and turned on the engine and started her up for his first drive.  I had high hopes about the car and I had heard many good things about it.  And let me say I was not disappointed at all!!  The car drove like a dream.  It was only a 4 cylinder so because of its weight it doesn't have the greatest pickup (If you get a car like this go for at least a v6).  The car was a beautiful silver color and the design of the car is absolutely divine.  The car gets great mpg and the interior design is spacious and VERY comfortable.  Your read end fits very comfortably into the rippled leather seats.  Heated seats is also a nice feature to. :)  The car has a lot of trunk space which is nice because we have a lot of stuff we carry back and forth to the offices.  

   This car is now my crown jewel to me.  I take very good care of it and cheap it in tip top shape.  If you are thinking of getting a car like this don't hesitate and go look at any other dealership.  Jeep is the way to go all the way!!!  I love my Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and I wouldn't trade it in for any car (well maybe a Ferrari) :).<br><br>
