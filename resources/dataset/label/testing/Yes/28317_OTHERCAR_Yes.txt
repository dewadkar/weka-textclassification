            I was a ragtop guy, but wanted a 4x4 so I bought my Amigo because 
I loved the looks and it was half a ragtop.  At the time of purchase,
many of the features I wanted (6-cylinder, auto-lock hubs, automatic) were not available, yet I bought it anyway.  I have not regretted my decision at all.  It's noisy (as are all softtops), fairly bouncy (as are all small 4x4's), and is underpowered (as are all 4-cylinder trucks), but it turns on a dime and except for a broken a/c hose after a month, there have been no mechanical problems.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy a new one (it has all the above features), but I love this one! <br><br>
