            I never paid much attention to the Mitsubishi Eclipse until the new body style came out. When I first saw others driving it, my imagination went to work. It reminded me of a small space ship ripping up and down the highway. I had to have one, however, I put it out of my mind because I was certain that I could not afford it. Though I purchased two other cars before I finally settled on the eclipse, I never stopped picturing myself driving it. Finally dissatisfied with my last vehicle, I decided to find out if I could afford the Mitsubishi Eclipse. My faith that there were good affordable cars out there was shaken. I test drove an RS model and it was solid and the ride was smooth, yet it still felt like a sports car.  I went into the dealership and haggled over the final price and payments, when I finally decided to lease it for 3 years. Well this is my last year in the lease and I'm still very satisfied with the car. I have not had any major problems with it at all. The only thing that was irritating was the third break light. There's nothing really supporting it, except for a piece of metal. After having it for two years, it started to bend and it finally broke off.  I have discussed this with other Eclipse owners and they've spoken of the same problem. That was really not big deal, because there was also a break light on my spoiler.It was also irritating to me to have to get tune-ups every 15,000 miles or so. I would recommend this vehicle to someone who wants the sports car feel and look, but not the sports car price. However, I would not recommend the RS model to a die hard sports car fan. You will be disappointed.  <br><br>
