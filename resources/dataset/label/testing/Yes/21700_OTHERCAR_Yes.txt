            I bought my second corvette, a 2003 coupe, red, Z51, Auto, this year, primarily because I could, and because GM had offered 0% financing, and I could at least think Im using GM's cash for five years at no cost.

My first Vette, an 85, was traded on this car, while not wanting to elaborate on the problems of the C4, it was a very drivable, enjoyable car while I owned it.

If you have ever driven pre computer era muscle cars, you will understand this:  The technological and handling leap from say a Mid 70's Camaro to the C4 Vette, is equivalent to the leap from a C4 to a C5, there just aint no comparison from one to the other.

This 03, in my opinion, has had the birthing bugs worked on since the inception of the C5, they have upgraded engine technology, and tweaked the bugs that were inherent with the new design, this car is like driving a land jet, or a 4 wheeled crotch rocket, I CANNOT put in words how smooth and powerful this car is, its staggering.  The words luxury and performance have come to mean the same thing with this model.

I specifically chose a Z51 package, which gives you the performance handling of the Z06, and also allowed me to get the more powerful rear axle. It also removes the "magnetic suspension" option which has been deemed adequate as a touring suspension, but lacking on the performance end.  Unfortunately, 03 is the last year for the Z51, fewer drivers want the extra noise and roughness associated with the stiffer suspension, my dealer said only about one in ten 03s came with the Z51.

Right now GM plans to end the C5 in 2004, with a mid year release of the C6, a less sporty version of a corvette, with non flip up headlights,(it looks like a Camaro), which will share its chassis with a freaking Cadillac.

My opinion, GO BUY THE NEWEST C5 YOU CAN GET!!!!, these cars are a bargain for the mix of luxury and performance you get, the Bose stereo is awesome, the heads up display is so convenient for not having to look down at the speedometer, especially if you dont want to take your eyes of the road at 140 plus,(done it, and I have yet to find a road to wind it out on.), and aftermarket upgrade parts are plentiful and cheap, Ive already completely swapped out the air filter system and ducts to the plenum, installed a hi flow MAF sensor, and bought and installed a factory take off ZO6 titanium exhaust I bought on ebay, those upgrades have added 25HP and made a Fast car SCARY!, at a total upgrade cost of about $1000.

BUY THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!
