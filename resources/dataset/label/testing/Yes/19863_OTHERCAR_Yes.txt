            When I went out look for a new automobile, I look at many different types. I looked at all types of cars and trucks.  My last car was Chevy Corsica. I really enjoy that cars but she was getting old and spend more time at garage be repaired then I was driving her.  So I sent off one Saturday to find a new car or truck. I stop be Nissan dealership since my first car was a Nissan pick-up. I was told up front they could not afford there Frontier. So I went to Ford dealership and test drove there Ranger. I then went to Chevy. I drove a black S-10 and feel in love with it. It may not have the power of some of the bigger pickup. But the S-10 has a charter all of her own. She keeps the &quot;pick-up look&quot; that Ford has lost in there lines of pick-ups. It I got a good deal on a 1999 S-10 a little over 10,000 with rebates. My package included: cruise control, A/C, cassate, cd changer, stick, tilt steering and tinted windows. She has good pick-up and gets great fuel milage. The S-10 has a lot or room in the cab, which is important to me. The S-10 comes with 4/wheel anit-lock brakes, dual airbags, and passive theft deterrent system, which may help to lower your insurance. <br><br>
