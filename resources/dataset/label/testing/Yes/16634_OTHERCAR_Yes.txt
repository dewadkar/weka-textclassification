            On the morning of my 19th birthday, I woke up and called my bank to see if my loan application had been approved. It had and by 9:30 that night, I drove off the Courtesy lot in Tampa, FL with my new Accent. I got the smallest package I could; manual transmission, am/fm cassette player, two door, hatch back. The only option I wanted was AC. The great things about this car are bountiful: corners better than any car I have ever driven; adequit factory stereo; ice cold air; easy to use hatchback; smooth manual transmission; and, most importantly, an amazingly responsive break system (I know, they have already saved my life once). It also has second generation air bags.
The security features on this car are impressive. Each piece of glass had a number etched into it as part of the Silencer Security System and tracking system. (Your insurance company will like this feature as well.) The Silencer is installed in most already, it is your choice to get it activated or not. I chose to do so at signing, but to the best of my knowledge, you can always go back and have the dealer activate it. 
The warranty is outstanding. Five year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and ten year/100,000 mile major components and roadside assistance. That's right, roadside assistance including trip interruption benefits (reimbursement of reasonable expenses for meals, lodging, or alternate transportation in the even of qualifying mechanical disablements). (Reading directly from my letter sent with my roadside assistance card.)
Basicly, this is a great car for a great price, with a great warranty, and garanteed great customer service.
