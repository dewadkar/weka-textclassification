            My wife and I bought a 1996 Ford Club Wagon Chateau in Feb. 2000
because we needed the expansion room, and my wife has always wanted a van. She wanted a van that she could drive, but wasn't too hard to park. Well, the van is great but DON"T try to squeeze it into small lots.
What we got for $14,000 was a Extremely full-sized van with room for 7 passengers. The two seats behind the front are captain's chairs, and one bench seat. The bench seat is removable or convertible to a twin-size "mattress". The side windows are IMMENSE, and provide our two year old with the best view! 
We bought a non-customized version with the V-8 5.8L engine. It has plenty of power for passing, and towing. It also has power seats and windows, but not much else in amenities.
We all love the roomy interior and the color. We also love the dual air controls and the way it handles. It drives more like our Taurus than a van. We don't like the mileage it gets on road driving, especially since gas is now $1.60 in Michigan...

Driving this van is very easy, easier than expected. Since the mirrors are so large, they give an excellent view behind you. Combined with the huge side windows, there is only on "Blind spot", directly behind the van if they tailgate you.

All in all, a very good buy for families and anyone needing a LOT of room.
