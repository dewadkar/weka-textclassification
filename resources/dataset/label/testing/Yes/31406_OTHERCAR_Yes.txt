            I had this car for rent and also test drove it again recently. I'd say it has very good price comparing to the competitors and a lot of features. 

Pros:
+ Great price. It has the same features as say Mitsubishi Galant but Alero is $2000 cheaper.
+ It has nice interior, model with leather is especially cool.
+ Convenient seats.
+ Good view.
+ Has good horse power too.

Cons, don't know much actually:
- It's not a near luxury car,even with all the features available.
So, if you want something near luxury go for Intrigue.
This car is good to drive and just best value for the everyday drive to work.What else can you wish for?<br><br>
