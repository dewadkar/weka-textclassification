            The 1996 Ford Mustang-- my first car. My dad picked up Black Beauty (oh like you didn't name your first one!) at a repo auction for $5,000. Absolutely nothing needed to be fixed, and it passed Maryland inspections with flying colors. The previous owner really loved his car-- it was bought with Cobra wheels, and yes, it was a mere V6 automatic. (He also hallowed out some parts in the seat, which leads to the suspicion that he was a slightly shady individual...)

The sexy curves of this car still captivate me. Both exterior and interior are filled with prime examples; the dash has this really cool "hump" design, housing the display and glove box. The glove box is teeny, but if your top priority is a big glove box, get rid of some of those maps and napkins! The interior lights are very sharp, and the stock stereo is hardly the worse one ever made. 

I put my Mustang through an accident. Her front was smashed in nearly to the frame, and her rear bumper dented. (In case you were wondering, that is a fiberglass hood! And is it ever MESSY!) I was involved in a car sandwich, with no casualties. My boyfriend's head did hit the roof of the car on impact, and he gained a mighty knot. So, this is not a car for anyone 5'8" , and as a 5'6" person everything was right there for me, and if it wasn't, it was adjustable. 
Speaking of adjustable, the seats can accommodate that 6'0" passenger just fine, although he may complain about his head hurting when you slam on the brakes. 

The backseat, although tiny, has served me well when being the designated driver. (This car seats four, please, for the sake of comfort, safety, and common sense, do not put more than four in it, especially drunken ones.) The molding of the backseat replicates that double-hump look of the dash, which is just too cool. Mine was black exterior with charcoal gray/black interior. I'm a messy, messy person with a big smelly dog and I'm a neat freak all at once; the interior stayed clean for about 14 days, but I could stand the mud for about a month. Black's a very forgiving color when it comes to spills that stain, and the fabric used in the interior cleaned easy and rather well--it met my standards.   

Personally, I think the V6 is quite sporty. I added Flomaster dual exhaust because loud cars are a security blanket to me. Growing up, we always had exotic and loud cars, and although a Mustang is not very exotic, can it ever get loud. I'm happy to report it's been the root of snooty neighborhood noise complaints three years running! 

I do have a few nit-picks with the 'stang. Turns are not as sharp as I'd like and have experienced in other cars. Also, I'm somewhat of a shorty, and being short plus a low-to-the-ground car is not the best to me, but these two are hardly reasons to gripe about such a great car. 

Black Beauty is starting to see the end of her life. She'll roll into 100,000 miles any day now, and her steering column does the strangest thing. If someone borrows my car and locks the steering column, it will take me a good 10-15 minutes to budge it, sometimes longer. This is a very recent complaint, and have since asked people to stop doing that, but in the meantime (don't tell my car) but I've been out test-driving. I want to sell her to a high school girl, like I was when I got her, and use the proceeds to get... hmm... any ideas? :)
