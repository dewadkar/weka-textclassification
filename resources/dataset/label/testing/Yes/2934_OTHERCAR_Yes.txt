            My sister recently got a new 2 triple 0 GS integra, and man is it ever a beauty. She got the incredible couple at a whopping 19,200. Of course I've spent more time in her own car more than she has so i can tell you alot more than she can. With the 140 horse power VTEC engine pushing this soft little body it's a real treat to zoom past those turtles on the highway. The only thing is that when you do zoom past them yours steering starts acting up at high speeds. The standard for the GS also comes with leather seats, which rocks. The basic warrenty on this car is also 48 months OR 50,000 miles which is better then honda.<br><br>
