            <b>THE TEST DRIVE</b>
I s'pose I drove this car under the best possible circumstances, but I tried to drive it under the <i>most</i> possible circumstances. I hit the dealership on one of those rare days when they were just to busy to fawn over me, so I got to take the thing for nearly an hour and go where I wanted to, to put it through its paces.<p>
Not only did it go through all of its paces very nicely, thanks, it taught me a thing or two on the way. It was very well behaved on the freeway, and required remarkably little getting used to. I did struggle for a moment or two with what I thought was a large blind spot, until I realized the headrest had been adjusted for a much taller person, and wouldn't cause a problem once I took it down a notch. Similarly, the shoulder belt initially felt a little weird, until I discovered that the latch point on the door jamb was also adjustable, and had been adjusted a bit too high. At the next stop, I twiddled with both the shoulder belt and headrest, and everything was just dandy.<p>
So we went up the steep-climb highway, this little car and I, while I was afraid I'd have no acceleration to merge and get past the slow trucks. I needn't have worried --- this thing had so much zoom-zoom I was passing the speed limit before I had thought I might hit 35 mph or so! Although this is only a 6-cylinder, it could accelerate and dance circles around my old 8-cylinder, which was much heavier.<p>
Next stop was a shopping center parking lot, to test the brakes. Beautiful --- they work and do the job, but without grabbing or a soft mushy feel. One caveat, though: you'll find yourself initially going faster than you thought with that zippy acceleration, so brake sooner than you think you'll need to, so you don't stand the poor car on its nose at the last minute. :-)<p>
Then it was time to come back into town along very narrow and twisting mountain roads. I noticed a slight tendency to understeer, but it was easily compensated for.<p>
Last stop was a street with some notorious speed bumps. The car handled these very gracefully, neither shaking my bones loose or being so mushy as to pretend the speed bumps weren't even there. I felt them, but the car didn't rock excessively, or make suspicious sounds near the transmission or oil pan.<p>
<b>THE PURCHASE</b>
Don't expect to get a steal on this car; they're just too popular for that --- especially in the combination of the metallic gray exterior and black leather interior. However, do spend your time and do your homework on the Internet, and you can come away with a fair, if not stupendous, price on this puppy. It's not appropriate to go into everything here, but you need to know what an invoice price is, why a dealer still makes money even if s/he sells to you at that price, what a holdback is, and how financing works "behind the scenes." These are all especially important when buying this car, exactly because it is popular and you want to make sure you're not paying a premium for that popularity.<p>
The options packages are right out of Lewis Carroll, especially the Mad Hatter. And they are enough to make you mad, in both sense of the word:<p>
"You've ordered X and Y; in order to have those, you must also select Q."<p>
"Okay, I wanted Q anyway, more than X and Y. What if I select Q by itself?"<p>
"You've ordered Q, which requires the addition of Z, which makes X and Y unavailable." Say whaaaaaaa??! Why I had to have a Bose sound system to get tush toasters (a.k.a. heated seats), I couldn't possibly tell you!<p>
The purchase itself went reasonably smoothly, and any glitches were almost certainly unique to this dealer and this transaction, so I don't think there's much to be gained by going into detail there. One recommendation, though: secure your financing through your credit union before going to the dealership, then pay them the agreed-on price by Cashier's Cheque. It puts in the driver's seat (har, har, har) and keeps you in control of the transaction --- and it gets you out of the dealership in record time. Mazda dealerships are better than most in that regard, but it's still nice to zoom-zoom in and zoom-zoom right back out again.<p>
<b>SO NOW THAT IT'S BEEN ABOUT A MONTH...</b><p>
Although I haven't put many miles on it in that month, this car just keeps growing on me.<p>
At first, I was a little put off by the red-on-red-on-red dashboard display. Yeah, it's cool, but it can become a bit hard to read in really bright light, because the red needles are against the red numbers. It's not a problem when the headlights are on, because then the needles are lit very legibly. It's only difficult in really bright sunlight. Likewise, there are switches to dim the display (all the brighter/dimmer switches then become relative to that), which really help legibility, but it would be nice if there were a light meter that would do that automatically --- especially since the manual process involves two switches, not just one.<p>
The center console is beautiful to look at, and gloriously symmetrical. Some ergonomics had to be sacrificed to achieve that exact symmetry, though. All of the functionality is there, but chances are good that the various functions are not where you expect them, and you'll need to get used to that.<p>
This is a theme that runs through several controls --- all the comforts of home, but not necessarily where you'd expect to find it. There is a function for Auto setting the fan speed, but it's not on the fan switch; press that one and it simply turns the fan OFF. Auto fan speed is part of Auto everything: temp, vents, and fan speed. Not a big deal once you're used to it, but it takes some getting used to. Likewise the switches for the Tush Toaster (seat warmer) is not only on the center console, but tucked under the latch for the console storage area. Once you're used to it... Well, you know the drill.<p>
Trunk space is surprisingly large, and the opening is thoughtfully designed with a low lift-over. The trunk features two latches to release the 60/40 split rear seats, to load long items. Very handy.<p>
Final "pickies": The sunroof features two independent switches, one for sliding and one for tilting. It's not difficult to roll this into a single switch, and it would have been nice, as it saves visually hunting them down and taking your eyes off the road. The switches for the trunk release and hood release are so far down by the driver's legs that it's difficult to see; it would have been nice to have them in very distinct shapes and/or textures for quick & easy identification.<p>
<p>
All in all, I'd recommend this car to anyone who, like me, want a little fun and a bit of practicality to go with it.
