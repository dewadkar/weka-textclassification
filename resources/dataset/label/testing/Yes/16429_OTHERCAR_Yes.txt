            I purchased my FinePix 2400 Zoom after reading recommendations on a mailing list on computing as it relates to genealogy. The selling point for me was that other genealogists had had a lot of success taking pictures of headstones, not normally known for their easy readability.  .

I haven't yet tried it out on a headstone, being some 3,000 miles from where my ancestors roamed and died. It might also be handy for capturing pictures of records you have to leave at the library.  I took it on a recent trip to San Diego, and got some wonderful pictures there (got one of the pandas, don't know which one).  I ran out of memory since the SmartMedia card only had 8 MB, but I read in another review of this camera that the number of pictures you can take depends on the resolution you set.  

About two weeks ago, I took a picture of this gorgeous unknown plant that is growing in my front garden.  My mother wants to paint it.  I have no idea what it is although I saw them all over the San Diego Zoo, and understand they're also prevalent in Balboa Park.  It looks like a succulent, with wide, shiny leaves.  It blooms about twice a year, at the beginning of spring and fall.  My plant produces about 5 enormous flowers that are like a round ball of individual, bright orange blossoms, with yellow down in the center of the blossom.  It looks like a plant made for the tropics.  The picture I took and printed on photo-quality paper was incredible in its clarity and detail.  

I haven't had the problem with battery replacement that others have experienced (and it is considered a down side to this camera), but it sounds like the most battery use occurs when downloading the pictures to the computer. When I purchased the camera, I also purchased a Fujifilm FD-A2 Floppy Disk Adapter; it looks like a floppy disk but has a slot to insert your SmartMedia card. Run the FD-A2 setup, insert SmartMedia into floppy disk adapter, plug into your floppy disk drive and voila, pictures.  The software is a no-frills, basic view program, very easy to use so you get right to looking at and printing your pictures.

Since my trip to San Diego, when I first used the camera, I've been running around trying to get candid shots of my menagerie.  The little dickens(es?) are painfully camera-shy, though, and especially so when in their most outrageous posture.  Like feline Filbert standing on his hind legs under the piano, darting a paw onto the keys and making "plink-plink" sounds.  Or my four wieners, Sampson, Jazmine, Cindy and Smurf, lined up outside the patio door waiting for me to let them in.  All they need is Santa hats, and what a precious moments Christmas card I could send to my sure-to-be-excited friends and family.  

I've found this camera to be very easy to use, even for someone like me who is not very proficient with cameras, in general.  Definitely a "point and shoot" camera, with replay of the picture you have just taken and other features I have just begun to explore. I previously owned a Mustek (forgot the model), and find this one much more user-friendly, and the final picture product very superior to what I was getting.   There's even a handy warning message that the lens cover is closed, something I definitely need.

The adapter for this camera is sold separately (new trend?), and costs about $40.  I also bought some extra 64 MB SmartMedia cards so I will have plenty of memory when I go out taking pictures, without having to erase one of the cards.

For the price ($399), this is a great buy and a great product.
