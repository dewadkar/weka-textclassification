            Best of all is the amazing picture quality this camera produces.  Focus window shows you exactly what part of the picture the camera locked on to focus.  It works. Colors, saturation, contrast all good. Needs a little help with overall brightness. The USB port works fine to transfer the picture to the computer.  I use M/S Digital Image Pro to process the pix and find that most indoor shots need a little help, but outdoors are perfect every time. 

Hint:  Take all pix in high res if you have enough memory.  Once in your computer you have enough resolution to crop, resize, and manipulate the data to get perfect shots from every capture.  This makes me look like a pro to family members and friends as almost all shots are great shots if you can edit them somewhat. Starting out with enough data (aka high picture resolution) is the way to do this.

My three complaints are the crummy lens cap that you have to fiddle with to clip on.  Sometimes I get it not completely on and the clip binds or the string is in the way. Minolta surely knows how to design a better cap than this.  Another is the selector switch rotates way too easily. Just putting it in the camera bag I've accidentally found it turning on.  And that's another thing.  Get a larger carrying bag. The ones sent with the mail order stores are way too small and you have to shoe horn it in.  Don't do this.  Finally, I found I've accidentally opened the side door (one with memory card and USB port) several times.  It's supposed to open by depressing the slider lock. So don't know how it's opening. Maybe they need stronger springs or other latching mechanism.

The camera comes with loads of other features and manual adjustments that pros like to use and tinker with. I'm working my way toward learning more about them.  Yet in the auto mode ... very good pix.  

I bought rechargable NiMh 2000 Mhr batterys.  These keep the camera going for over 130 pix.

Even tried the video capture mode. Pix and sound are quite good for those short vignettes. Captured my son's super pancake flip ... a family triumph.  Come to think about it ... that's what makes this camera great.
