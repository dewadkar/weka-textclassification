                   The Mitsubishi Montero is an affordable SUV with plenty of room and a dream to drive.  I purchased a 2000 Montero in December and fell in love with it right from the start.  All in all the total package of the Montero is suprising for its cost.  The model that I purchased, the LS, has alot of bells and whistles on it for its price.  It came standard with power locks, power windows, privacy windows (tinted windows), CD player, and lots of storage compartments just to name a few.  As far as driving goes, it glides along the road like a dream, sometimes making you forget just how fast that you are going.  The powerful V-6 engine gives you alot of get up and go, which should interest even those picky people that dont want to part with there sports cars and  get into something &quot;bigger&quot;. The stearing is power assisted which makes it alot easier to turn, and the blind spots are almost non-existant due to  big side view mirrors and plenty of glass all the way around.  I feel that anyone that is looking into getting something a little bit bigger should look into the Mitsubishi Montero before anything else.  With this vehicle, you get alot for your money, and then some.<br><br>
