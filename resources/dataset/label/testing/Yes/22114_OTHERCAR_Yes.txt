            i've had this digital camera for a while and I LOVE DIGITAL CAMERAS!!! not only are they fun to play with, they allow you this great flexibility with your photos..my kodak (dc215) for example, has so amany features, so many i don't know how to use all of them, but i don't have to! i just picked it out of the box pointed and shot...and the best part about digital cameras is if you don't like the picture you can erase it and take it again and again! The only problem i encountered was that i have a Mac G3, and my digital camera did NOT want to work with it, so I had to get a thing called a &quot;flash card reader&quot; which takes the little cards with the pictures on them and reads it directly, like a disk. But as for the camera, i recommend it for anyone who wants to have a digital camera. its small, compact, and pretty lightwieght, it even turns itself off when you aren't using it. But watch out---this thing SUCKS UP batteries, so i recommend the longer life ones.<br><br>
