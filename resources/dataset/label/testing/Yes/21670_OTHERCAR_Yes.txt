            Bought a used 1994 Toyota 4Runner about 2 years ago for $20G - but I still considered it a steal because it only had 18K miles on it! Plus it came with a 10-CD changer, all-leather interior, etc. But anyway, before I go off-track completely, let me tell you the pros and cons. First off, I love this SUV. If I could, I would buy a 1999 or a 2000. That's how pleased I am with mine! It comes with a 190HP V6 engine (mine is an SR5 V6) that other SUVs eye jealously. The &quot;trunk&quot; is very generously roomy, this can be a plus or a negative - seating for rear passengers is a bit cramped, but its great for cargo. I especially like the power window in the back - it can be controlled from the center console in the front! The air-conditioning system is fabulous, good reliable stereo, kick-butt wheels that can take you anywhere you want to go. The 4Runner really hugs the road as you drive, and this is one of my favorite features - total driver control. The engine on mine is just a tad loud, but I think its because mine is somewhat older - I haven't noticed this on the newer ones. Mileage could have been better - mine gives me about 16 miles to the gallon - I understand Toyota still hasn't worked on this for the 99s (I wonder if they will rectify this in the future). The 4WD system is push-button in the newer models (mine comes with the good ol' manually-shifted 4WD) and really gets the job done (trust me on this one, it kicks a** in the snow!) You have to remember, however, that fuel consumption increases greatly when you drive in 4WD (this is in ALL SUVs, not just the 4Runner). Side-view mirrors are appropriately-sized for a truck, nice and big and let you see everything. The 4Runner is a man's truck, and yet the ladies seem to love it too (quite a few of my female friends own 4Runners). Some people have expressed concerns about the height of the 4Runner, so I wouldn't buy this as a &quot;family car&quot;, especially if there are older individuals in your household (getting in and out may be a problem for them). All in all, a rugged SUV and also recently named **SAFEST SUV** on the market for the 1999-2000 year. I hope you just wanna jump out of your chair and run to your closest dealer now....hope your experiences with your SUV is as positive as mine have been. Good luck!   <br><br>
