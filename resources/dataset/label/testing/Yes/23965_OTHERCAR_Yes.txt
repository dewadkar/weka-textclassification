            Back in the late 80's and early 90's I was the kind of person who only kept their cars until the warranty ran out then traded it in for another new car.  My 1991 Subaru Legacy was the last NEW car I've ever purchased!  

I have the 2WD LSi edition.  Included in the LSi package are a power sun/moon roof, leather interior, luggage rack, sport wheels, upgraded stereo system and a power antenna. (Hey that was a lot of extras back then!)

To date we have only had to change the oil, brakes and tires.  We have it tuned when needed and the dealer offered free oil changes every 3,000 miles for as long as we own the vehicle, so the oil gets changed religiously every 3,000 miles!

The car handles well on the highway and even though it is only 2WD it handles excellent on the snowy hills of New England.  We currently have 140,000 miles on it and it's still just as peppy as it was on the day we purchased it.

If I had to pick a drawback it would be the leather seats.  The sun shines into the car and the seats can be like an oven!  We always keep an extra blanket in the back so if the kids have shorts on, they can put the blanket on the seats and not get 3rd degree burns.

We hope to hold onto this car as long as possible.  It has been good to us.
