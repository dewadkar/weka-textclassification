            I bought a camaro because I have loved the camaro style as far back as I can remember. I love everything about it. The power it has is great. You can pull out with no problem or hesitation. T-tops are great. Having the wind blowing your hair. Especially at night, just look up and all you see is stars. I feel very comfortable driving this car. It is easy to relax with plenty of leg room. Also the safety features are really great for a sports car. The camaro is a very popular car at affordable prices. Well worth the money. I would recommend this car even for younger drivers.<br><br>
