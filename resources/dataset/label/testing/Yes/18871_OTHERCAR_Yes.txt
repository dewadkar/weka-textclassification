            I purchased a 1998 RAV4L last year.  I loved the look and style of the vehicle.

What I like best about the vehicle is that it is a car when you need a car, and a truck when you need a truck.  You sit higher up than in a car, and yet are not so high up that you need to hoist yourself in.  It is very easy to find a place to park.  Just try to fit one of those other SUV's into the compact spaces!

I have the model with full time 4WD, and it has both benefits and disadvantages.  I like the feeling of having more power, but it does make it a little harder on gas - especially with city driving.

It has great pick-up for passing or merging onto freeways.  It has a very smooth ride.

I wish that the headrests were adjustable.  It would also be nice if the window in the back door would go up and down for air circulation.  I have found that it can be a bit noisy at high speeds when the back seat windows are open. 

The cargo area is surprisingly roomy, however, fitting three in the back seat can be a tight squeeze.<br><br>
