            When it came time to replace my towing vehicle, I didn't even consider the Ford Explorer to begin with. It's outdated looks and short list of standard features suffered when compared to more current offerings. Then I saw the newly reskinned 2 door Sport for 2001 with it's host of upscale features. When I drove it for the first time I was in for a big surprise. To merely state that its' acceleration was brisk is the understatement of the year. With a fully loaded vehicle for $28.5K and $200 over dealer invoice, I plopped my money down. Then I put on a 70 series Flowmaster muffler and a cold-air induction package which improved engine breathing and boosted HP to a more respectable number (Dyno results: 217 SAE bhp at 5450 rpm).

Now with 25k miles gone by, this SUV hasn't had any problems at all. The original Firestone tires were replaced N/C with 255/70R/16" Michelins which ride ooh so smoothly. With 0-60 mph in 7.4 seconds at the local track, the German designed 4.0 liter engine benefits from it's happy revving SOHC configuration and is an absolute joy to drive. Out on the highway this truck has a superb ride for a vehicle that can also take on the Moab or Peter's Run in Virginia.
 
Torque (240 Lb Ft) peaks at 3,750 RPM, stock horsepower (205 SAE)at 5,250 RPM and the upgraded 5 speed transmission (5R55E) with defeatable O/D is a heavy duty unit borrowed from heftier trucks in the Ford lineup. Towing capacity is a hefty 4,980 lbs (3,580 w/o wgt. dist. hitch) and the stock 205 HP engine pulls it along effortlessly. Final drive ratios are optionable, but the 3.73 rolls along at 75 MPH at 2,500 RPM, perfect for interstate cruising. Highway mileage to date is 22, city 18-19 mpg.

I wasn't fooled by ads for the new crossover vehicles that don't hold practically any cargo with their seats up or down. They're also definitely not trucks that can really rough it. The Explorer Sport also outstrips many larger vehicles in the cargo department and can swallow a 36" HDTV with the box or your new 80 gallon water with no sweat.

With it's short wheelbase of 101.8", higher 16" wheel ride-height and a restyled front end, the Sport has very good approach and departure angles for four wheeling and good on-road visibility. With low range engaged, this 4X4 can negotiate very steep inclines (in the snow) and do some moderate rock crawling as well. Ground clearance is 8.25", more than enough for any offroad encounter; provided of course you remove the provided step-up bars. With disc brakes (12" front, 11.25" rear) all around, the four wheel ABS braking is good to superior, exhibiting no fade after repeated stops and good pedal pressure under emergency braking.  

New standard conveniences and interior features are just too numerous to list. Suffice it to say that amenities abound in the revised Sport that rival luxo cruisers at $40-50K.
 
With the new interior, exterior features and new suspension setup, Ford has taken a proven vehicle and vastly improved it. You can get a 4X4 with a 6 CD Pioneer unit along with leather, sunroof, power everything with side air bags, skid plates and block heater for under $29K. My only quibbles are leather faced seats that aren't comfortable enough for 6 hour plus trips, a gas saving computer program that causes the transmission to shift into the next higher gear sooner than is desirable and a smallish 17.5 gallon fuel tank.

If you want a car-like ride and wood panels on the dash, get a car, I mean "crossover" vehicle. If you want a powerful SUV that carries more, really goes off-road, is totally reliable, tows 2 tons and looks better than the competition... get the Ford Explorer Sport.
