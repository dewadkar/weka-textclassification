            Lets face it, Ford was the best thing to happen to Jaguar since Simon Templar. Ever since the introduction of the current series V body style, Jaguars quality and reliability have pulled to within even of Europes best. 

True, Mercedes and BMW still have more percieved value and exclusivity (except here in LA where the 540/740 and 500/600 are as common as a Civic), but Jaguar offers a real alternative. The BMW's handel better and the Mercedes are more precise and refined but both are rather cold compared to the JAG and I bought my girlfriend an e240 with the $30,000 difference over the Merc. 

With the 370 bph of the 2001 XJR, the adavantages of the two strudel wagons are more theoretical than real. When am I ever going to have to worry about that s500 doing 165 while I can ONLY do 158? And I have yet to be 'left' at a stoplight by either a 540 or 740. And I will never be throwing ANY 3000 lb sedan around the Mulhuland curves at more than 50 mph!

There are those who will always prefer the Merc or the Bimmer, and thats neither right or wrong. But the Jag does now offer a fully competitive alternative with a unique and inviting character.
