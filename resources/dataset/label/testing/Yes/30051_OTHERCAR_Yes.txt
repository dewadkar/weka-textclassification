            Kodak has done it again. They have released an excellent camera, with high resolution (2.1 megapixels or about 2000x1200pixels), a fairly large amount of memory which is upgradable to as much as 128mb (largest compact flash card I could find), plus the internal memory. It takes pictures quickly, with a very nice refresh rate between shots. On many digital cameras, you have to wait several seconds for your picture to be processed before you can take the next one. Not here. Seemingly instantaneously this camera lets you take another, and another, and another shot. It has wonderful controls, allowing you to edit, delete and view your pictures on the go, quickly, easily, and painlessly. There is a catch though - this is not a bargain buy. For almost 700 dollars you are getting the best camera money can buy (within reasonable standards), and are getting a great deal for your money. But, you are paying a fair amount of money to get that great deal.<br><br>
