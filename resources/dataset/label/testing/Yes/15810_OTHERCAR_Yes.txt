            The Solara is a fun to drive quiet and responsive car. I have owned many new cars in my lifetime and I have found my true love. It shifts so smoothly you can't feel it. I have the top of the line model and the fit of the doors and exterior trim is perfect. The interior is leather and fits like a glove. I really love the car and finding negatives to say about it is difficult. The only thing I don't like is that the trunk lid is does not have an electronic release so that when I had my alarm system installed they could not put a trunk release on my remote. It drives beautifully and is aimed at the baby boomer generation, which I am a member of. My overall opinion is that it is the best car I have ever owned.<br><br>
