            When I went to the car dealership, i wasn't planning to buy a Corsica.  I test drove about 4 different cars and the lady started giving my mom and I a hard time.  Then I saw two Corsica's on the lot.  After my mom told the lady off for hurrying us customers, I decided to test drive the white Corsica (because an ex girlfriend that is a real nut had one of the other color, which was a '95).  I liked it a lot.  Years earlier I had totaled my mother's 1989 Corsica, and I felt like it was a very safe car.
I purchased it and I have been happy over all.  When I was a bit younger, the insurance on it was ridiculous.  The car has a driver side air bag, front wheel drive, a 3.1 v6 engine, 14" tires, and tons of room inside.  That tends to be my problem with smaller cars is that they do not have enough room in them to be comfortable, but this car has tons of room in it, and it's really not any bigger than say a Lumina, and just a hair bigger than the Elantra, but inside it feels much more spacious.
The car seems to be put together to last.  The only things wrong with it are things that go with every car, like right now i need weather stripping, my windshield and rear windows resealed, brakes (every 18 months or so it seems), and I need a full alignment.  Other problems I seem to have had are loose wiring (i live on a bumpy road, so I'll blame that), the wipers always need tightening, and when it's cold, the car sometimes feels like it's gonna stall(I must point out that it never has stalled on me, though).
Now some of the good things... I love where the cup holder is, above the glove compartment, but not too far from the driver.  There's also an additional cup holder that has an ashtray that covers it...very convienient.  The acceleration picks up very quickly, i sometimes almost enjoy slowing way down just so I can speed up quickly.  There is a button to open the trunk from the inside.  I have power everything, and the driver side window also automatically goes all the way down with the one touch system, which is also very convienient.
There seems to be endless trunk space in my car, but the rear seats fold down in case you need more room.  The car is an automatic with floor shifting between reverse, neutral, drive, 1st gear, and 2nd gear.  The cigarette lighter is also located on this console, but it doesn't seem like a great setup as it's very loose when i plug in my cd player or radar detector.  There is also a console storage area for cd's and tapes.  Inside the console there are change holders and lot's of room for pens and the like.  On the visors there are mirrors on both the driver's side and the passenger side, with little sliders to cover the mirrors.  There are even little lights on the rear view mirror as well as a larger interior light in the middle of the car.
