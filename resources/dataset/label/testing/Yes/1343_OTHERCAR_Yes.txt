             I traded my 1988 CK 1500 V6 at 150k with no major complaints,for a new 1999 Silverado Ext cab V6 Base Model in April of 1999,The truck now has 9k on it but started a vibration at low RPM, I had it in the shop 2 times so far with no fix as of yet,The dealer told me Chevy is aware of this problem in there V6's but are not sure what is causing it,Hope they come up with A fix soon. I love the ride, I get a slight rattle in the passenger side seat when no-one is in it when I hit a bump,Gas mileage has been great 22-24MPG,The only Interior Complaint is 40-20-40 seats in the base model. The center console DOES NOT FOLD DOWN,Which was very disappointing needless to say useless to get to the rear.I am very pleased with the over-all truck,If your looking for a truck with all the bells and whistles base models not the one ,But at Less than $21,000 you cant beat a Chevy.<br><br>
