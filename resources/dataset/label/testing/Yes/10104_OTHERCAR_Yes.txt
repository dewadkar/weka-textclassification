            When my younger brother and his wife were looking for a vehicle in 1996, I suggested the Taurus/Sable.  I told them it was the best deal for the money.  His wife was totally against it.

In 1997 we were looking for a different vehicle, we shopped around but ended up taking the advice we'd offered my brother and his wife.  Our only criteria was &quot;american made&quot; (I use the term loosely).  We bought a 1996 Mercury Sable LS because we found it was the best deal for the money.  

We negotiated a spoiler in our deal to spruce it up a little--I'm so glad we did.  I think it really adds to the looks.  The color is the bright, medium blue.  My dad calls it &quot;electric&quot;.  I like it because you don't see it a lot---stands out.  My only complaint about it would be that it seems to scratch particularly easy.

With the twin cam engine and the spoiler, I feel pretty &quot;sporty&quot; in it.

When looking at this car, I saw for the first time a cloth/leather interior.  I'd never heard of it before then.  It's a nice option if I couldn't have all leather.  The part of the seat where you sit and up the back is cloth and around the edges, the headrest, and the back of the seats are leather.  I'm so thankful the back of the seats are leather because my son tends to touch it with his wet shoes/boots.

The only problem we've had with it is the frontend would shake some while braking.  I took it in and it was covered under the 3 yr. 36,000 mile warranty that came with the car (we did not purchase it). 

It gets great gas mileage but I've never actually stopped to figure out actual miles per gallon. 

It's a comfortable riding car, even on long trips, although I've never been in the backseat for a long period of time.

It has the option where the back seats fold down creating a bigger opening from the trunk. You can fold down one seat or both.  I've never used this option but my husband has once or twice. The trunk is deep--too deep. There are time I've actually had to climb in it to get something that has rolled back up against the seat.

After we bought our car, guess who ended up buying one for themselves???  you guessed it, my younger brother and his wife!

The only problem I have with it is it's not big enough to carpool all the neighborhood kids to preschool if my husband isn't home to watch the baby.<br><br>
