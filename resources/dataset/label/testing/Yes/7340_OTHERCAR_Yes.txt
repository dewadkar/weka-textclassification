            I bought this one to replace my Kodak DC210 (1.2 MegaPixel) camera, on which the plastic battery compartment broke. The first thing you'll notice is the size and weight. This thing makes my old camera feel like a brick. It fits easily in my pocket and I hardly notice it's there.

When taking pictures outdoors, the picture quality is amazing. Very, very nice pictures. Indoors, it takes good pictures with the flash, although indoors with a flash will require 4-5 seconds of focusing and sometimes come out blurry.

The menu system is simple, and has all the needed options. This camera also has an interesting feature: folders. You can store your pictures in seperately numbered folders, and categorize them. Nice when you get a bigger memory card (I have a 128MB).

The camera is very easy to download pictures from. You can connect it to a Windows XP computer and it will be autmatically detected and shown as a disk drive (i.e. E:\). Pictures are downloaded quickly with the included USB link cable.

The camera also includes a moving picture / video mode. At first glance I thought "great, another digital camera trying to be something it was never meant to be". And of course, it's no video camera. But the video mode is surprisingly decent. It takes very small video of course, and uses a decent amount of storage space, but it really doesn't look too bad for a digital camera. And strangely enough, it also records sound. Go figure.

This includes digital zoom only; no optical zoom. For me, this was not a problem, as I rarely need to zoom in. It's important to note, though, that you cannot use smart zoom (digital zoom) while in 3 MP mode. You'll have to go down to 2MP to get 2x zoom, and further down to get more. That definately decreases the effectiveness, although I will say that the picture quality using Smart Zoom is very, very good for a digital zoom system.

The battery life is very good; with the included NiMH batteries it lasted me a day or two on vacation with probably 50+ pictures taken a day, using the LCD display and usually no flash. You should really consider investing in another pair or two of NiMH rechargables, though, as it's good to have a charged pair around with any digital camera.

In all, it's a very nice camera. I'm very happy with it. And for only $200, it comes quite affordably ;)
