            I have been eyeing digital cameras for sometime now. But the prices really turned me away from them.  I do have a standard issue 35MM camera, a scanner, a decent printer, and only taking the occasional slew of pictures a few times a year, I couldn't justify getting a digital just to have instant gratification pictures.  After all, film developing these days, and the price of film isn't unbearable costly.

But, I couldn't resist and kept my eyes peeled on ebay checking frequently for a reasonable camera and a reasonable deal.  Well, my time came. Someone was selling the Toshiba PDR-M1 it just had a faulty battery door. I came over to this site and read all the information I could, even read the reviews on other Toshiba's.  It really wasn't too bad.

As you know (because I'm typing this review), I won the camera. And I am very glad I did. This camera is very easy to use, so easy, I thought I did it wrong! I was up and running in 15 minutes!

My next purchases were based on what I read, I bought rechargable batteries (8 of them) and a battery charger, which when you buy the batteries, they usually give you the charger. That turned out to be a good investment, I had 4 regular batteries in it, and they were dead within 2 hours of heavy use. Now the rechargables I haven't had any problems whatsoever.  I also purchased a 16 MB. smart card, (it came with a 4 MB), another good investment, I recently attended a family function and took 47 pictures! At normal quality, and 1280 x 1024 file size. Now, the picture quality, on my computer screen the pictures are really pretty nice.  I've printed out pictures on glossy paper and was pretty happy. Happy enough that I have framed them and hung them. If I had a 35MM picture hung next to it of the same thing, yes you could tell, so I'll make sure not to do that!  But I do have to add, that the pictures are simple ones of my dogs or one person, if the photo is busy or has a lot of people or colors it seems as though the integrity gets lost. But, I don't know who gets the total blame, the camera or my printer.

Now the not so good aspects, the camera takes a few seconds to come on, so if your trying to get a fast snapshot of something, it's not going to happen. You really have to plan out your pictures. Also there is a lag time between shots, which if your trying to get off a few fast shots you can't.

Another nice feature is being able to review what you've taken pictures of, so you can erase pictures before you take the time to download them. But like my title reads, I wouldn't get rid of the 35 MM just yet. I still like having the 35 MM for those events where the picture may become a 5 x 7 keepsake, like from a wedding or graduation. I guess you could get the new special printer, for photo like quality pictures, but if you can afford that, you my as well get the top of the line digital to go with it.

I think having a digital camera is a fun addition, because you can take pictures of things you otherwise wouldn't if you were paying to have them developed, i.e., a funny sign, your car, and where it's instant you can send things to your family immediately. Also, I don't know if this has happened to you, but I'll go through a box of old photos, and wonder why I kept half of them, I have half an arm of one person, and a picture of half a dog. I've thrown out a lot of pictures, with a digital, I store them on my computer or on a disk and erase what I don't want.

So I would definetly recommend this camera. For an average picture taker, I think it's a pretty good camera.<br><br>
