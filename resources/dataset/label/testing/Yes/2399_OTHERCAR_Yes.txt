              Well, this is my first digital camera. I did do a lot of research before deciding on the PDR-M5. I read up on a lot of usenet message, read the preview article on a few of the review sites. I also waited till they are in stores so I can handle one for real. 

  I ordered mine from Egghead, $617.00 plus shipping was a great price, our local Best Buy is charging $799 but it does includes an extra Li-Ion battery.

  The unit is fairly light (coming from a SLR) and is a bit bigger than other digital camera (the Oly 2002) and is about the size of a average auto-focus 35MM camera with zoom. It does handles very well with all button well placed.

  The setup and operation is fairly straight forward, the auto-fucus is a bit slow but the speed between shots is great with a burst mode available that allows you to take 4 hi-res shot in 2 sec.

  Transfer to the PC is a snap with the USB cable, I setup both my Laptop PC and My desktop PowerMac with no problem at all. The transfer is quick, a full 16MB smartmedia transfers in about a minute.

  The included Image Expert software is real easy to use and I was soon printing out image on photo paper with great results. It's a much better program that Adobe Photo Deluxe which came with my scanner which won't even do contact sheets.

  Overall, it's a good quality unit and it's a great price for a 2.1 mega pixel camera.
