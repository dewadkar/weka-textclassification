            I leased a 1999 Alero GLS in Jan 1999 for business and have been happy with it since. I ordered every possible option on a 1999 2dr Alero GLS in Black. Included with the sport handling option were optional polished aluminum 16 wheels with Goodyear  Eagle tires. Very nice trim package came with leather interior in camel, and optional 3.4 V6 gave it plenty of power. Always order all available options on GM cars as they are reverse designed-- that is to say they are designed as full option cars and items are REMOVED off them to make them cheaper. Cheaper models rarely work as flawlessly as fully optioned models.

First off, the looks and performance of the car were excellent. Handling was good, but torque steer --due to front wheel drive-- was excessive. Layout of gauges was good but the digital odometer was funky. Hated the cruise control buttons on the steering wheel. Better to put them on the stalks where they are more easily accessed. Fog light button too low and poorly lit at night. CD player/stereo gave top quality sound out of its six Bose speakers but CD changer was sorely missed. Positioned too low and away as well. Worst was the second cupholder positioned in FRONT of the auto shift lever. Made it useless for anything except change. Glove box in center console was also too far to the rear of the console to make it handy. Visibility was fair, but rear view mirror was too small and funky wire leading to map lights ridiculously exposed. Looks awful.

On the good side, seats were marvelously comfortable and adjustable. Make sure to order leather seats. Little known fact-- leather interiors also get you better padded seats, always order them. Plenty of room throughout the car especially for a two door. Rear seats fold down easily but interior release would have been nice. Trunk roomy and easily accessible.

OK, after 8000 miles front rotors had to be replaced, a common problem on GM cars. Has to do with the way they are shipped. Theyre covered under warranty, dealer gave me loaner Alero during repair. At 12,000 miles brake light burned out, but easy fix. Have replaced oil and serviced per owners manual recommended intervals. First brake job was at 32000 miles- pretty good considering my stop and go driving habits and lead foot. Dealer completed repairs, again with loaner, no problem-- and good news that only the fronts needed doing, a nice suprise. I'm at 44k now with no major repairs. Its overdue for a tuneup; ive noticed the performance starting to drop off and slight knock under heavy acceleration suggests the need for a new O2 sensor. Thats to be expected. Goodyears, as always, run like gold-- 44k and no problems. Probably will need replacement at 50k judging from wear. Id never buy a car without Goodyears on it and havent since 1985.

Overall the car has performed marvelously, and i'll be sorry to give it up in Jan 2002 when the lease is up. I dont plan to keep it, because of the high mileage and the fact that GM cars are notorious for self destructing at about 60-65k. I wish they would reconsider the demise of Olds, they never gave this new line a chance. Wish this car came in a convertible. As usual GM missed the boat there.
