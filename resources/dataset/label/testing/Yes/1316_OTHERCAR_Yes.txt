            The reason I bought my Honda Passport is because of the 'Honda reliability'. I was also ready for the benefits of a small-medium SUV. I had a Honda car before my Passport and it was the best car I had ever had.  However, my family now needed more room and I hated being behind SUV's and trucks and not being able to see anything. Once I drove the Passport I fell in love with it. There is a difference in the way it rides. It is not as smooth of a ride as a car but that was a benefit for me because in my car I would fly at rates of 80-90 MPH and not even realize it...with my Passport I know when I am going above 75. (Which like I said is a good thing for me...I was able to get rid of my radar detector.) It's the perfect size for a family of 3-4 members.  I have never run out of room to pack things. There are also some places to hid things from the kids. You can go camping in it! If I need go across some rough terrain I don't have to worry that it can't handle it. I have had my Passport for a 1 1/2 years now and I still love it!<br><br>
