            The 1994 Dodge Ram 2500 Magnum V10. This truck has been my urban assault vehicle for just over two years and all i can say is WOW! (both amazed and appalled)
Let us begin with the positive. The Dodge Ram lives up to it's reputation for ruggedness and gobs and gobs of power and torque. I really think that they should have kept the Power Wagon moniker for this one. Having been equipped with four-wheel drive I have yet to find a way to get it stuck. Neither have i been able to attach anything to it that it couldn't pull. Maintenance has been relatively minor with the exception of a few too many recall notices, although none were to serious. Now for the amenities; with power seats the ride is rather nice, given that it is a big truck. The Infinity stereo is more than adequate, with good sound quality across all ranges. The controls are easy to read and operate with the exception of the radio which is a bit of a stretch. I am given a commanding view of traffic that almost rivals that found in the big rigs. Throttle response is awesome, but i would have preferred the automatic (I have the five speed).
Now, unfortunately, I must turn to the other WOW! (read ouch!) The gas mileage has hovered right around 10 to 14 miles per gallon whether fully loaded or empty. That's not too bad, but in the soaring gas prices of the last six months I find myself in my car more often than I like. The parts for the V10 also run more expensive, naturally, about 15%-20% more.
So in review this has been a worthwhile purchase and a highly enjoyable one, but in light of the increasing gas prices, may not have been the engine of choice in the present day. But i am glad to have made this choice for its distinctiveness of styling and dependability of operation and would still recommend it to any serious truck buyer.<br><br>
