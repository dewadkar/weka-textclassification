            I just bought a 2001 Rodeo LS.  This has been one of the best car-buying experiences I've had.  The current promotion is 0.0% financing (03/30/01).  I called around to nearly 9 dealers in a 150 mile radius.  Nobody seemed to have the one I wanted in stock, everybody was sold out.  The promotion had been going on for nearly a month now.  

I ended up having to drive a hour south of where I live to get to a dealership that had the car I was interested in.  On the phone, I told them what I wanted and they put together a VERY ENTICING offer over the phone.  

They were willing to give me nearly $1300 more on a trade in of a '95 Blazer, compared to the local Isuzu dealer. I thought that I'd just be wasting my time driving all that way and thinking the salesman was going to bait-and-switch me.  You know how it is, you get there and suddenly your trade-in isn't worth spit and the car you wanted isn't even on the dealer lot.

That was far from the case.  They had 3 different colored cars for me to choose from, all with the options I'd wanted.  Here's the deal that was put together.  

1) $100 over invoice.  I confirmed this with EXTENSIVE research from the internet as well as Consumer Reports.
2) Got the extra $1300 on my trade-in.
3) Got extra running boards, a $300 option installed for free.
4) Choice of a free DVD player or 21" color TV, worth $300 each. (I picked the DVD player)
5) 0.0% financing for 60 months!

It was sure worth the drive time.  My salesman was great!  He worked hard to get our business, treated us with respect and he didn't give us the run-around.  I know they could have made alot more money off of me.  I would have paid $2500 more if I'd have bought the car locally.  It really PAYS to shop around.  Saved another $5000 worth of no finance charges!  How can you beat a deal like that??? :-)

As of writing this review, I have only 200 miles or so on the engine.  Everything is great so far.  I do find the seats to be a little lacking in support.  It would be nice if the seat had a height adjuster too. 

The running boards are very nice.  Being female and standing at 5'1", the ground clearance of 8.2" on the Rodeo makes getting in and out less challenging.  I would recommend running boards for anyone who is similarly vertically challenged.

Gas mileage is a bear.  But then again, what SUV out there gets great gas mileage?  Haven't calculated my average miles/gallon yet.  Probably around 15-16.  Ick :-(

Get a look at the maintenance schedule for the Rodeo.  Suggested oil changes at 7,500 mile intervals, not 3,000.  If you drive an average of 15K a year, then you'd go through 5 oil changes a year, costing roughly $30 x 5 = $150.  With the Rodeo, get about 2 changes a year $30 x = $60.  Not to mention all that oil you won't be contributing to pollute the earth.

Spark plug and timing belt replacement at 100K miles, just to name a few!

Stay tuned.  As time progresses and the mileage racks up, I'll be writing another review.  So far, I love the car!
