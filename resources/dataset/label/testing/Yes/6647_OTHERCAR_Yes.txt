            Buying a car these days is a study in compromises. As cars become more expensive, one must balance the things one needs for the things one wants. The frequent trend now is to strip the base model down to an imaginary price point, to get people into the mindset to buy one, then pile in charges for all the options that people never quite encountered. When people balk at the overall price, they get it conceiled in fancy financing options that blur the real cost with a cheery looking monthly payment. It was nice to look at the 'standard' package for a 2001 Volkswagon Jetta GLS, and see nothing to add but automatic. 

So, a few months, I bought a new VW Jetta GLS. I was happy with my deal, and took the car home. Mostly, I use this car for my commute - a few miles back and forth to work every day on highly congested Northern Virginia roads. But, now and then, since I've had the car, I've taken a longer road trip.

In terms of reliability, I haven't had any problems whatsoever. The car accelerates well (despite the fact that I passed up the 1.8 T), stops easily, and corners sharply. Steering is excellent, although the car is a bit heavier than some of its peers.

Fuel efficiency is important to me, and I'm pleased to report I've been averaging between 25 and 29 miles to the gallon. On my one road trip, I drove 505 miles on about 16 and a half gallons of gas, averaging over 30 miles to the gallon.

I'm very satisfied with the quality of, and the presence of, standard options. Here are a few that stand out: Air conditioning STANDARD (versus, say, Honda, where it's a dealer installed option with mysterously unknown pricing), full sized spare, remote keyless entry, active security system, *8* air bags (side curtains, front & rear, side head, and front), antilock brakes, and daytime running lights. 

Appearance-wise, the car is very sleek. I like the lines, the shape, and the (bright green) color I chose. I also love the blue nighttime illumination of the controls. Everyone who's ridden with me comments on how much fun everything looks at night.

I'm very pleased with my purchase, but one or two things could make things perfect: 3 year, 36,000 miles on the bumper-to-bumper would be a plus. I wouldn't mind standard CD in-dash (we're talking less than a hundred bucks here, after all), and extending traction control to the 2.0 from the VR6. But, these are mostly small quibbles - the car lives up to my expections, and well.
