            The car I got is the manual transmission sedan, with two wheel drive, no ABS, no options added except floor mats.

I bought this car a month and a half ago, and between my wife and myself, we've put on about 2200 miles so far.  We are very happy with it.  It's a very powerful car (145 hp, it weighs something a bit over a ton, I believe), and is a lot of fun to drive.  I live in Seattle where there's a good number of hills, and the Aerio goes up them like they're nothing.  My previous car was a '92 Toyota Pickup truck, which I would sometimes need to engage 4 wheel drive just to get moving up a hill.  The turning radius is also good at 16.4 feet according to their site.  The car is short, which makes parking a breeze in the city.  The fastest I've driven the Aerio is 95 mph just for the sake of driving that fast once, and I drive at 70-75 mph on a somewhat regular basis.  At these speeds the car does just fine.  It's not loud, it doesn't get blown around, nothing.  The only performance downside tends to be at the slower speeds (under 10 mph).  If you're in first gear, you have to continuously give it gas on a straight road or it'll slow down and die, and it also gets real jerky anywhere in first unless you're extremely precise with the accelerator.  Though not extensively, I have driven many other cars (I used to park them for a living, and after that I unloaded them from trains at another job), and I've never encountered one that jerked you around like the Aerio does in first gear.

I calculated the mileage I've gotten as being 25 mpg, about 70% city/30% highway driving, but if you know anything about Seattle you'll know that much of that driving was at speeds of 10 mph and on hills, and also my wife and I tend to both be in the car together a lot (We weigh 300lbs combined).

As for the interior, I like the way it looks.  I've seen other people say it looks real cheap and such, but I think it looks just fine, but maybe I just have bad taste - check it out for yourself.  One thing you can't argue with is that it's very roomy.  I've had a 6'2" passenger in the back a bit, and he said it was about the only time he's ever felt comfortable in the back of a car.  There's also a lot of room in the trunk which is good if you're in the Mafia or something, though there is an internal trunk release. The speedometer, tachometer, etc. are all electronic, which I guess is good, they look fine to me.  There's also an external thermometer which is nice if you want to know what the temperature outside is NOT (I don't believe Seattle's ever been 108 degrees).  The car comes with a cd player which is nice, and I'm fairly certain it has 6 speakers.  The car also has air conditioning, and power windows.  The power window on the driver side also rolls all the way down if you push the button hard, which is good for things such as reaching out to swipe a parking pass or grabbing your hamburgers from the drive-through.

The exterior, well I'm sure you've at least seen pictures of it.  If you like the looks, great for you, if not, too bad.

The car also has all kinds of safety features which are good for deer/tree hunters, though I haven't gotten up the balls to really put them to the test.  They include dual airbags, reinforced steel sidebars, daytime running lights (the running lights majorly suck if you're into going to the drive-in as you're supposed to turn your lights down while you're parking/leaving and everyone honks at you).

Unfortunately, I can't comment much on the mechanics of the car, as I don't know jack about how cars work - I was looking for the hamsters in a wheel when they opened the hood for me, but the dealer explained those were just in cartoon cars.  All I can say is that fluid levels are cake to check, as they're all in clear containers that you can check just by looking under the hood.

Before the Aerio, the only vehicle I've driven any significant amount was my truck, so that may have impact on my view of the Aerio.  For example, other people complain that the Aerio is too tall, but for me I'm used to taking curves in the road at 5mph below the advisory speed, so in comparison the Aerio is far superior in that respect.  Also, I believe that the higher vantage point makes driving a lot easier.  The few times I have driven lower/normal cars, I've felt insecure with the amount of the road and other cars I could see due to the low height.

By the way, other cars I tested were the 2003 Toyota Echo and 2003 Hyundai Accent (stop laughing, I know I'm poor).  Both of those cars were pure misery to drive, and the Echo even cost more - the lowest prices I could get on those were $7500 for the Accent and $11000 for the Echo.  I managed to get the Aerio for $9995.  I noticed that's considerably less than other people paid for it, and I have a suggestion for them:  Get the dealer's lowest price on the dealership's paper with their signature (say it's so your bank/wife/whoever can look it over), then take it to another dealership and tell them that you'd feel more comfortable doing business with them because they were recommended or you wanted to see their stock or whatever.  Repeat as necessary and stop overpaying for cars.  Sometimes they won't shake at your price until you walk out their door and find their message on your answering machine.  It's also always a good idea to buy near the end of the month at a dealership that is struggling to make their goal.
