            My fiancee and I purchased this vehicle the end of August of this year. I'm due to have a baby the end of November, and the vehicle he had was a 1999 Eclipse Spyder Convertible. We definitely needed something a lot bigger and more practical for a family. 

We also were looking for a vehicle with a big engine that could pull something big in the near future like a boat or a horse trailer. We went and looked at the Explorers. They were only a couple thousand dollars less than the Expedition. We figured if you're going to pay that much for an Explorer, you might as well pay the extra thousand or two for a much bigger and better vehicle. 

We test drove one with leather interior and totally fell in love with it. We went back a couple days later and traded his car in on it. With it being so big, I thought I would never be able to drive it considering I was used to driving a Jetta. I drove it a couple times at night here and there, when there wasn't that many cars out. 

Well now I'm used to driving it and I love it. Whenever I get into a car to drive now, I absolutely hate it. I feel like I'm sitting on the road, and I don't feel as safe. I definitely recommend this vehicle to anybody. Some people think that with it being so big, it will ride rough. Well it doesn't.

My fiancee compared it to a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee he had, and he said that our Expedition rides a lot better and smoother than his Jeep did. We found out recently when we took a trip, that it corners real good, even better than his Eclipse. They have lots of room in them for a couple kids, and lots of storage space in the back to go on long trips. <br><br>
