            As a recent purchaser of the Dodge Durango I would like to give it my whole hearted thumbs up!! My previous vehicle, a 1997 Chevy Blazer is a downright slug in comparison. The handle and performance of the Durango are for superior, and it just has a much better feel on the road. Living where we do in British Columbia we encounter all types of road conditions from dry paved to snow covered dirt and the Durango eats them all up. Another feature which although seems very simple is one of the best I have seen is the placement of the Stereo Controls on the back of the steering wheel, this enable you to make adjustments without your hands leaving the wheel or eyes leaving the road. The only problem I have encountered is keep the keys in my pocket as opposed to my wives. <br><br>
