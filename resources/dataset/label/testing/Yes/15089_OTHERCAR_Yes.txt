            I have been leasing Lincoln Continentals for the last 12 years. I always get the two year lease because I don�t want the car when things start to go wrong with it. I am currently on my sixth strait Lincoln and the reason I will never buy any other car is rooted in a story from my third Lincoln. 

Me and my family were driving up to upstate New York to drop my daughter off at camp. On the way while my wife was driving, she fell asleep at the wheel. Everyone else in the car was also asleep. We were on the NY State thruway doing about 70 MPH. On the side of the thruway there is a little ridge right before the shoulder. My wife woke up startled and turned rapidly to get off of the road. She hit the lip on the side, the tires caught and the car flipped over. It�s momentum carried us about another 50 feet I think (I blacked out). 

We were told by everyone it was a miracle that we had survived such an ordeal. My wife had to have stitches in her head due to a laceration from a piece of glass other than that, everyone was fine. We had survived a devastating rollover car accident. Granted the car was totaled but it had done its job it kept it�s passengers safe. I to this day believe that it was the quality of that automobile that kept my family alive. I will never by another car.<br><br>
