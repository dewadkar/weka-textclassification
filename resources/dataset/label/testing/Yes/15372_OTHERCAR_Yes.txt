                         The digital Mavica MVC-FD83/FD88 is light weight and easy to use. It runs about $600 dollors. The camera comes with a power cord, A/V connecting cable, shoulder strap, battery charger, NP-F330 battery pack, and a lens cap. 
             This camera does not take film it uses a 3.5 inch 2HD floppy disk with 1.44 MB capacity. 
             There are so many wonderful features this camera offers. It has a LCD screen, for wide viewing, and excellent clear picture quality. It has a bright +/- button for adjusting the brightness of the LCD screen. The photocell window for the LCD screen becomes brighter when exposed to sunlight, automaticlly. The Mavica camera can also film a movie for up to 30 seconds with volume that can be adjusted +/-. The self timer button records the subject/s after a 10 second period.
             The flash can be turned on or off, or put on auto. The play/still/move button controlls basically what you want the camera to do. Still is for just taking pictures. Pictures are taken with the push of a button, with a five second relay time. Play, shows the last recorded image taken on the LCD screen. The forward and backward arrows allows you to view the other pictures previosly taken on the disk. The delete feature allows you to delete any picture that you view that you did not like and takes the image off the disk. The move button plays any movies recorded, in sound.
             When the disk is full press the eject button and it pops right out and a new disk can slide  right in. The batteries last about an hour and then have to be recharged. The disks store roughly 25 pictures and slide right into your computer for viewing, and printing if desired. The only downfall of the camera is that once pictures are on a disk they can not be put onto a film so the only viewing of them is on a computer. 
             When your done just hit the off button, take the batteries out and place them in the recharger. The camera goes back into its storage case.
             I highly reccomend this camera to anyone it will be the last one you will ever buy.
