            Since it is a Honda vehicle (the fifth my family has owned) you can rest assured that the overall quality is there. I bought my Passport in December of 2000. (traded in my much loved '99 Integra GSR, and yes I would do it again.

<b>Interior</b>
The inside of the passport has enough room to accommodate four to five average size people. I point out average, as I am 5 "10 and I have more than enough room. However, I have a couple of large friends (6 "3 and 6 "5) who don't look too comfortable when they're riding with me. The durability of the interior is good. There aren't any odd noises that distract me while driving. I notice my right knee pressed against the center console when driving (this may be something to consider when test driving) it doesn't bother me, but I have noticed it. I've also noticed that the back seats don't lay completely flat for storage. I may be overlooking something but I don't use this feature all that often. Overall the interior has more than enough room for me.

<b>Exterior</b>
Not too much to say here... Other than I really like the exterior on the Passport. 

<b>Drive</b>
The ride is very good... Almost drives like a car. For an SUV the Passport is relatively quiet. I do notice wind noise from the back on occasion, but it doesn't bother me. I mentioned the turn radius as a con, as making "Uies" (u-turns) can sometimes be troublesome if it is a tight one. Also, if you have to make a sharp corner at a higher rate of speed (15mph +) the roll on the vehicle can be intrusive. The horsepower is okay, but I really wish Honda would put a V8 in the Passport. I have a manual transmission and will notice engine hesitation on occasion, I believe this to be one of two things. <b>A.</b>My inability to efficiently drive a manual transmission or <b>B.</b>The need for fuel injection cleaner. I mention the cleaner as I use regular unleaded gasoline (don't pay for that high octane stuff).

<b>Price</b>
The price wasn't too bad, as I bought my 2000 model late in the year. Paid something around $18,000. I would suggest that anyone considering a Passport look at Isuzu Rodeos as well. If you're reading this you probably already know it is the same vehicle. I think that Rodeos may be a few dollars cheaper and you can probably haggle between Honda and Isuzu on the price (get them to work against each other). :)

<b>Overall</b>
A good buy. I would buy another Passport. In the past I traded vehicles about once every 1.5 years, but I'll be keeping my Passport until it crokes. It is a comfortable ride with average gas mileage for an SUV. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.
