            In October of '99, my father purchased a '00 Lexus GS300. It's an elegant champagne color, with tan leather. Even now, the car is still as breathtaking as it was four years ago.

The GS300/400(430) sedans is Lexus' sporty luxury sedan. It's competitors are cars like the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E-Class, Audi A6, Infinity M45, and Jaguar XJ6. All cars are in the 40-50 thousand dollar range.

The engines that can be found in the GS are one of two. The snazzy 3.0 inline six cylinder in the GS300 pushes out 220 horses. Zero-60 in roughly 7 seconds. Quick, but not fast. The powerful 300 horsepower 4.3 liter V8 in the GS400 (now GS430, same engine), is blazing, zero-60 in about 5.8 seconds. Thats quite difference. The six cylinder makes the GS the slowest car of the bunch, but the V8 makes it the second fastest. The fastest being the M45 (not including the MB E55, BMW M5, and AUDI RS6).  I think the bigger engine is worth every penny. We have the GS300 cause my parents are too conservative really, and couldn't care less about speed. I still regret I couldn't convince them. Top speed on the GS3 is 143, and the GS4'll get you to 150 easily. 

Since we only have the GS300, I can only speak from experience about that. The car really is dead quiet. The car accelerates smoother than any car I've ever driven. The car accelerates pretty quick from 60-80, so watch out for those speeding tickets. The gas is pretty sensative, I found myself going unexpectidly faster than I needed the first time I drove the car. The handling isn't off the charts, but adequate. You can get through your daily driving with ease, and comfort. I wouldn't however feel too secure, because of the overall size of the car, racing through turns and curves at higher speeds. If you take the required precaution, you'll find the GS300 can take on any obstacle. You can switch the car into different "modes", allowing you to choose between Power, Normal, and Snow. The car will adjust accordingly. The transmission does shift pretty smooth, and the gear selector has a solid feel to it. There is an optional tiptronicesque transmission with manual gear selection in the steering wheel.  

With all that power I'm sure you'll be looking for safety. The car is equipped with ABS, Airbags, Safety belts, alarm, the works, but also day time running lights, a reinforced body, security alarm, and vehicile stabilization feautures.

The aesthetics of the car in my opinion are amazing.  The car's design is unique, not only from other cars in its class, but of Lexus' in general. It's a look that just screams sporty.  Inside, there is ample room for 5 (4 adults could fit more than comfortably).  The dash is incredible. The guages are a brilliantly lit, and glow at night. They are embossed in with deep circles, making it impossible for the passengers to see your speed (this is actually good, ha). The controls are easily reached, but the stereo would probably require you to take your eyes off the road for a second. It is placed lower than normal. There is a 6-Disk CD changer found in the glove compartment, which would previously be found in the trunk. Although it is a 6 CD chagner, it's now more tempting for risky drivers to reach over and see if they can switch some CD's around en route ;-). 

The audio system is pretty good. Nine speaker/subwoofer (AM/FM/6CDChanger) is clear and loud. There is an upgradable stereo system available for the GS400/430 by Nakamichi. Although I haven't experienced it myself, I heard it was pretty darn good. There is an available navigation system too, which I belive is just decent. We don't have it.

There is more than enough leg room in the front, and just ample in the back. The back seat, however, is wide enough to accompany five people (four adults easily). Headroom in the front is just fine. Taller people in the back should be fine aswell, and since ths seats swoop, they shouldn't be blocking the drivers view. The trunk space is pretty big, just what you'd expect though. Front seats are power adjusted, so is the steering wheel. There is a seat memory which will record the prefered position of two drivers. One thing I dont like however, is the drivers seating position in general. Even when you adjust it, I feel like the steering wheel comes at you to straight, unbalanced with your view of the road. I am not sure if you know what I mean. It's really not a big deal, its just If there could be anything improved, it would be that. 

There are many accesories available to the GS. Some I've mentioned before, like the navigation, and Nikimichi audio, but there others like heated seats, a variety of rims, spolier, gold trim, and more. Lexus makes performance upgrade parts for so far I think only the GS. It's called L-Tune, with it you can upgrade your exhaust, rims, grill, add side skirts, new chip, and other add-ons of that nature. Expect basic amenities like leather, wood trim, sunroof, keyless entry, and power everything.

The GS gets decent fuel mileage, 17 / 24 mpg. Toyota makes reliable cars, and Lexus is no different. You can sit back, without worrying or anticipating problems.

In the end the Lexus GS is a strong contender in the sporty-luxury car class. Even though my pops has one, if I was ever in the market for a car in that class, I'd take a GS in a heartbeat (and I could sleep at nights too).
