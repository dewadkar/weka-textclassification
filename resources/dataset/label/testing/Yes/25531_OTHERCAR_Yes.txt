            My folks have bought a new Suburban every year since about '86 and this one is definitely the best so far.  Finally, a sunroof is available!  One just feels safe inside this massive metal cocoon.  It is certainly one of the biggest vehicles on the road, except for the new Ford Excursion, which personally I think is ugly.  The truck rides a lot better this year - it seems better balanced, and the brakes are smoother, and the ABS doesn't cause that unnerving coast upon application as in years past.  It has more luxury appointments - including posterior warmers in the seats, which are great for the Colorado winters.  It also has the Onstar navigational system, which is great, IF you get lost and have something against stopping at a gas station to ask .

The most impressive thing to me was the driving experience.  I didn't like driving the previous Suburbans, because they felt a little &quot;loose&quot; and squirrely and not as well balanced as I like (I'm a sports car person).  This year's Yukon XL is extremely well balanced, and stable, even in cornering.  The steering is far more responsive, feels lighter, and overall provides a far better sense of &quot;car-like&quot; driving than years past.  The throttle has a smoother, more sensitive response, as well, which further contributes to the overall wonderful driving experience.

The two best reasons for buying this vehicle is hauling numerous persons or things around, and safety. You can't get much safer than the good ol' Suburban.  I'd highly recommend this vehicle.<br><br>
