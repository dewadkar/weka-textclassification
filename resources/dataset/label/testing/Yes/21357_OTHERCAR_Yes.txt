            I purchased a 99 Toyota Camry, 4 cyl. I came from driving a 97 Mazda Millenia 6 cyl. with leather and sunroof. When looking to buy a new car I looked at the Camry, Maxima, Galant,Accord,Passat,Jetta.....you name it I drove it. Prior to the Millenia I owned  Nissan Maxima, I actually owned two of them. All cars I have owned were 6 cyl and I swore I would never drive a 4 cyl. The only requirements I had were that I wanted leather and power seats. I was able to get all those in everything except the VW Passat and Jetta. These cars had just come out for 99 and getting leather was difficult.

I had really wanted to purchase another Maxima which I think is a great car. But after driving all the cars and comparing what I was getting dollar for dollar, you are really getting a great value with the Camry. I also wanted alot of room in the interior because of two kids and their backpacks. The Toyota is extremely roomy in front and back and very comfortable. When driving it feels like you are driving a larger car. The trunk is very spacious and you can get through to the backseat via the 60/40 pass through from the trunk.  The ride in the Camry is very smooth. 

Going from a 6 cyl to a 4 cyl was not as bad as I thought. I feel that Toyota has the best 4 cyl on the market. While a 6 cyl is faster, let me tell you, there's not that much difference with Toyota's 4 cyl. It does the job just fine. 

I haven't had any problems at all with the car (and I don't expect to)

Toyota really does give you value for your dollars. There is a reason you see so many Camry's on the road. Toyota has their &quot;stuff&quot; together. I ended up purchasing a 99 Camry, 4 cyl/ with leather and sunroof with the upgraded stereo/cd. The only drawback is the handling. If they could only make the handling more like the Maxima or a little more &quot;German&quot; . I would definitely purchase another Camry.
