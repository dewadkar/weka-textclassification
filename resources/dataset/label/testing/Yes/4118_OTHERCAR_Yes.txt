            Two years ago my mother in law asked me to go to the Nissan dealership and drive the Maxima she was thinking of buying.  I went, I drove it, I liked it, she bought it.  They were cleaning her car up, she had already turned over her trade in, and we were supposed to meet the guys for dinner, I asked the salesperson, can we take that black Pathfinder to dinner? 

Being the good salesperson that he was, he got me the keys and the tags and we were off.  I climbed into the leather drivers seat, threw it into first gear and headed for the highway.  I didn't even want to eat dinner, I was in love, I just wanted to DRIVE!  

After dinner, I took my husband out to see the new truck.  He wanted to know what it was doing there, we weren't planning on buying a new vehicle....I let him drive it back to the showroom.  That night he looked over at me and said &quot;can I have it?&quot;  We agreed to drive &quot;the others&quot; the next day to see if we liked anything else better.  Every SUV we got into seemed to come up short...we were barely off the lot before we were both wanting to go back to the Nissan dealership.  

The next day, that fully loaded black Pathfinder had found a home in our driveway!  Now 2 years later, the love affair continues.  The Pathfinder still drives terrific and has wonderful pickup.  It has gotten us through many snow and ice storms safely.  

The only flaw of this truck is that the suspension is bad in the back, back seat passengers do get jossled around a bit.  Usually my 1 year old daughter is the only back seat passenger, however, and she is strapped securely into her safety seat.  

I also love the roominess of the Pathfinder.  My husband and I are both very tall so the head room is great.  Plus the back seat is spacious enough to accommodate a passenger on either side of the infant seat if we need to transport that many people.  The back of the truck easily stores my stroller and other baby gear along with a full days worth of packages from the mall, or a kitchen full of groceries.  EVERYONE should be able to own a car they love as much as we love our pathfinder!<br><br>
