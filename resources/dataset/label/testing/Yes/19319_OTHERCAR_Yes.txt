            We purchased the camera to take pictures of woodcraft items my husband makes and to take pictures of my Longaberger Baskets to keep in our safe deposit box.
I am very impressed with how easy it is to use.  When we went to the store, we were able to use the camera before we bought it.  We originally were looking for something inexpensive, but knew we wouldn't be happy once we saw the cameras.
What I love:
It's great to see the picture immediately and retake it if needed.  Since I am taking pictures of objects for print, I wanted to be able to see if I was cutting something off or if the lighting was bad immediately.  I also love the way it goes to the program to edit and print automatically when I plug into the USB.  It couldn't be easier!  Once I installed the software on my computer, I didn't need a manual, it's very self explanatory.
I would recommend getting the AC adapter ($51 when ordered by phone from FUJI).  I would go through a lot of batteries if I didn't get it.
Who should buy it?
A beginner would definitely be impressed.  There may be more sophisticated cameras, but for the price, this is the best.
