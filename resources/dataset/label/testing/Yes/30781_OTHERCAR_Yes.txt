            I bought this camera because I enjoy photography but am sick of endlessly leafing through prints to look at my pictures.  I was attracted by the ability to store all my pictures in easy to find directories on my computer.  The only reservation I had was the questionable quality of digital camera imagery.  After using the camera for six months, I must say that I am ecstatic about the photo quality.  It has some problems with low light, and it lacks a zoom, but in good conditions, it takes pictures that are close to those of my SLR.  The camera is small enough to take with you most places, and their is no marginal cost to taking pictures, so I have been photographing everything.  Digital cameras are becoming a must-have device, and this one is right for the money.<br><br>
