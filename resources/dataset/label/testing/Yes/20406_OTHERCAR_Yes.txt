            I recently traded in my 1998 Plymouth Neon for a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta GLX VR6. I was in the lot of a local Chrysler chain, perhaps thinking of a slightly used Intrepid or some such, when my eyes glanced across the shiny green sheetmetal of the VW. 

Say what you like, but the Jetta has beautifully simple, classic lines. Its shape is pleasing from every angle, and from the back, it to me looks quite like the BMW 3-series sedan. Which is not a bad thing. 

I asked the dealer if I could drive the car, and I fell in love immediately. With the car that is, not the dealer. The Jetta's engine whirred to life with no fanfare, and the firm leather seats held me in place quite well. The wood-accented shift knob beckoned me, and I drove out of the dealer lot with an involuntary grin. 

This Jetta was blessed with Volkswagen's excellent 2.8-liter V6 engine, which produces 174bhp and 180lb-ft of torque. That means there's plenty of punch all the way through the gears -- especially 2nd through 4th. I put the little darling through its paces, until the salesperson who went along with me said tersely: "We don't pay for tickets."

But I was smitten. I had to have it, and have it I did. And I do. Now, a few days later, the honeymoon is certainly not over, yet I do retain some objectivity. 

One thing I do need to rave about, however, are the features on this car! Goodness! Power everything (windows, seats, locks, sunroof), leather, heated seats, Monsoon stereo, automatic climate control, daytime running lights, side airbags, full-size spare, on and on and on. Now, the car I bought did happen to be the GLX VR6, which is the very top end and has every option known to man. New, this car will set you back close to $28,000. However, mine has 16,000 miles on it, and I got it for about $20,000. Not too bad, in my opinion. 

The five speed transmission is a dream. It snicks into place with no fuss whatever, and the clutch is mated to it very well. I would, however, say that perhaps third and first gear are just a bit too close together on the tree, because i've tried to start from third about three times, and stalled each time. I'm learning though. The reverse gear is also a bit quirky. It's to the left of first, and you have to push down on the gearshift lever to select it. Not a major complaint, just takes some getting used to. 

Did I mention that the car is <i>fast</i>? If not, then I will. It's fast. Zero-to-sixty times are posted at 7.6 seconds, and I believe it. Top speed is governed at 134 miles per hour, and though i haven't attained it, I'd be willing to bet it's smooth as silk at that speed too. When you're going 70 it feels like 40. And it takes no time at all to get to 70.

It is front-wheel drive. That presents some problems, but ones that Volkswagen has addressed fairly well, in my opinion. Normally, front-drive cars with a lot of power tend to suffer from torque steer, which is the tendency of the front end to slew around a bit during hard acceleration. It happens a little with the Jetta, but it's pretty nominal. Another front drive characteristic is understeer, which is the tendency of the car to want to continue driving straight under hard cornering. This too is present -- but it is still a fun car to corner. There is a bit of body roll, but cornering is still a great pastime in this automobile. 

Naturally, I have a few gripes. The rear seat simply isn't fit for adults, though VW obviously sacrificed rear space to make as much front room in a small car as they could, and that at least paid off. I'm a big man, and I can easily find a comfortable driving position (the eight-way power seats don't hurt either). But I also like to take road trips with passengers, and that will be a bit tough with the rear seat. Still, that's a relatively minor complaint, as I'm not married and don't plan on having children anytime soon. 

Another minor gripe is the firmness of the leather seats. They do have an adjustable lumbar support, which is good, but still, I think they're just a touch too hard. It's nothing to complain about on short to medium cruises, but i suspect my back might start talking if I drove to Wisconsin from Pennsylvania like I did last summer. 

Also, the engine demands premium fuel. With today's gas prices, that's no joke. However, it's not too high a price to pay for love, for I truly love this car. It's a spirited, sporty, sophisticated sedan with superb manners.
