            Negotiating
Its amazing how you can go to a dealership and request a list price on a vehicle for which they will quote the highest price and then you start negotiating until they agree on your bottom price. Another customer will come in and buy the same exact vehicle and pay a higher price and get stuck paying more money. There is something wrong with this process. Somehow the dealership will always give you the right answer. How can we control there system? <br><br>
