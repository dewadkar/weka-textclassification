                This is the best car we have owned so far. Had it about a year now/13k miles. Great on a trip, but no matter where you are headed it is comfortable and has good visiblitiy to the sides and rear. The Windstar comes standard the same length as the "Grand" version of Dodge and Plymouth's vans. Lotsa room! Smooth feelin' boat-ish sort of ride, but once your'e 50, that's a good thing!
    Our's has the 3.0 V6, which we read is a bit lacking in passing/hill climbing abilities. I am here to tell you that I don't find it lacking unless you are comparing it to a V8. Yes, if you punch it, it kicks down a gear. But it does what you ask without hesitation and is back in top gear, ASAP. And,it maintains high-end cruise speeds without the feeling that you are "pushing" it. 
     I'm just impressed, what can I say? I would buy another one for my commute car, but I needed better mileage, easier parking. So I bought a 2002 Kia Spectra (reviewed, this website), which gets better than the mileage of the Windstar (about 25mpg). They are just two completely different automobiles anyway.
     But I sure miss all that room/storage and sitting up high, visibility-wise, which is a huge priceless safety factor. 
     Wish I had to run to the grocery store in California from the East, this would be my vehicle. 
     My advice is, go out and get one!
