            I was forced to purchase a new car when somebody decided to run a stop sign and total my old car. (which I had just made the final payment on the week before) So I was forced out on the new car market.  I really wasn't in te car buying mood, but for 2 weeks every night I would visit car dealers.  When I sat in the 1996 Taurus LX, I said &quot;This is it&quot; It has lots of leg room, and the seats were comfy, it felt like a big car ( I'm 6'4&quot; so I need the extra leg and head room).  I have been a happy camper ever since.  I really like the car.  I have now moved into a city, but refuse to give up the car.  I only drive occasionally now, but when I do I enjoy it.  I have never really felt like this towards a car before, to me a car is used to get from point A to point B.  Nothing more.  But my Taurus has changed all that.

I have have some problems with the car.  The fuel pump has gone TWICE on the car, but both times Ford replace it for free.  The brakes make a crunching noise, but I have been told by a few people that it has to do with the new metallic brake shoes.  Other than that, the car has been a jem.

I don't know who would buy this vehicle cause I would have never though I would.  But sit in it, if you feel the magic, then buy one.  <br><br>
