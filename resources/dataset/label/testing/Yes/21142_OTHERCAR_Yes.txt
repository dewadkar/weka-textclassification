            Granted I don't have much experience with digital camera's.  But I do my research and like my toys...  

I did a lot of research in coming to this.  At first in looking at the camera it looks akward to use.  In practical use it is very easy and comfortable to hold.  All of the controls located in easy to reach spots.  

The zoom is very clear even at the maximum zoom.  

You can take pictures in a variety of sizes (640x480, 1024x768, 1600x1200) and in two resolutions (fine and standard).

The movie mode is very fun to use.  It also comes in a varieties of lengths and sizes.  

There are many different sizes of memory that you can purchase.  Currently the highest is 64mb for about $139.  

All and all a great camera for the price!<br><br>
