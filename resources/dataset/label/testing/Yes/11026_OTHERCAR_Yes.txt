            We bought our used 1995 Astro mini-van about two years ago due to the fact our family was growing from 4 to 5.  Since then, we've have only minor problems. Nothing my husband couldn't fix.

I've had numerous compliments on the rear opening.  It's a 3-door opening (top and two sides).  And very accessible when loading groceries and numerous shopping trips.  Also, the back seat folds down easy enough for those BIG loads.(or even comes out if necessary)

My only gripe is (which is minor)that they put the rear defogger in such a spot next to the rear open latch.  In which I've opened numerous times trying to set the defogger which is blinded.

I wouldn't say it's my best vehicle I've owned, but certainly not the worst, either!<br><br>
