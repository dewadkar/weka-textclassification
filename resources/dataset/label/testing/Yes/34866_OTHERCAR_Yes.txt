            We shopped at &quot;Friendly Honda&quot; in upstate New York recently and just received our New EX 2001 &quot;Starlight Silver&quot; with some options &quot;thrown in&quot; at the MSRP price.
We bought this Minivan because we needed the &quot;extra&quot; cargo room to transport family and friends. We just loved the way the &quot;third row&quot; seats hid under the floor. 
We absolutely love the firm and yet quiet handling this Minivan provides.
My wife and I also find it a &quot;Joy&quot; to drive to and from long trips.
It's great having &quot;Peace of mind&quot; knowing your Honda product has a great reliability record. 
People with/without children should consider buying this van because of it's practicality and usefulness, and great looks too!!    <br><br>
