            I've had this vehicle for almost a week. It's fun to drive.
Figured since this was a major purchase, might as well get some extra perks.
Picked out the 2001 Kia Sportage Limited. Nice trim package, and for the budget price, the interior was pretty classy. It's got the wood trim dash features, good use of curves on the dash, as well as some shiny chrome trim here and there.
Even with 33,000 miles already on it, the ride was fresh. It is quite smooth, even at 75-80 MPH. I like sitting up a bit higher than in my last car. (1996 Mercury Sable Wagon)
The seats are firm, yet comfortable. Better support for my back with the adjustable lumbar support.
The Sportage is built on a truck chassis, so handling a bit of the rough off road was not bad.
Actually, it is nice now being able to get over curbs if need be. And, a bit off road is good just in case.
The children love the truck. they can sit up higher since the back seat is a bit higher than the front. There is enough room for a car seat in the middle, and just enough left over for the two other children in the outside seats.
Gas mileage is outstanding. Well...I'm used to a 6 cylinder, this Sportage is a 4.
As for power, no...it's not a drag racer, but with the Power select button, or the HOLD button on the shifter, (this is an automatic tranny), I can get enough kick when I really need it.
I'm not pulling a large load by trailer, nor am I driving in snow.....this vehicle suits our needs.
And...I just loaded a bunch of stuff for my children after the holidays. We can fit quite a bit in the back space.
although...they could use a window in the back that lifts separate from the door. This way, instead of opening the door and risking things tumbling out, you can just open the window upwards.
So...if you need something affordable, good on gas and fun to drive, this is a good choice.
However, if you are looking for the ultimate off road, highest quality parts, you need a 50,000.00 SUV.

Not everyone likes their cars....but some do.
Anyway...is there such thing as a perfect vehicle?

If you decide to go with a Sportage, and want something that looks classy and has a decent interior, (CD Player, leather wheel, power this and that...then the Limited is the way to go.)
