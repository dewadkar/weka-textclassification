            I bought my 1997 Neon Coupe new in August of 1997 because I needed a car that had great gas mileage.  I had a 175 mile per day commute between home, work and school.  I researched cars in the under $15,000 price range and decided to test drive a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Cavalier and the Dodge Neon.  I drove them all and settled on the Neon because of the great price and the adorable styling.  Because it was late in the year, I was able to negotiate a dramatic price decrease and paid only $10,500 for my new car.

So far, I am still very pleased with my decision.  I still own my Neon and still enjoy driving it.  My commute is no longer as tedious but the ride in my Neon is still fun.  I love driving a manual transmission and the stick in my Neon is the smoothest I have ever driven.  The cab forward design makes for incredible roominess inside.  I have fit five adults comfortably in my car on many occasions.  The front bucket seats are very comfortable.  I sat in this car for up to four hours a day (in Dallas traffic) for two years and never had a problem.  I also love the orange interior lights and the easy to access gauges.  I will always think the car is adorable as well.  Mine is white with black interior and tinted windows and I think it looks great.  I prefer the first styling of the Neon over the new styling.
  
I have to admit, however, that the car is not perfect.  I have had it in the shop on two separate occasions.  The first time was right after I bought it.  I took it in because the wind noise seemed a bit too much to be normal.  The dealership (Allen Samuels Dodge in North Richland Hills, Texas) basically told me to just deal with it.  This was what to expect from a $13,000 car.  ($13,000 was the sticker price).  I guess I am just used to that now.  I also took my car in because my left front speaker tended to go in and out from time to time.  This problem was never fixed either.  The dealership could not make the problem occur while the car was in their shop.  I must be used to that now too.  I also must express my unhappiness with the terrible blind spot in the back of the car.  I have no idea how I have not backed into anything in the 3 years I have had this car.  It must be sheer luck.  All in all, these minor annoyances have not decreased my love for this car.

I must also mention the terrible accident I had in this car.  I was speeding down Highway 635 in Dallas, Texas during a torrential downpour when I lost control.  I spun completely around at least five times hitting all four sides of my car into the guard rail multiple times.  Not only was I not hurt at all, I was even able to drive the car home.  It took quite a bit of work to repair the car but it looks and drives just like new.

As for resale value, my husband and I put her in the Auto Trader last month because we were going to buy another car.  I listed it for $7,000 (I only owe $4,000).  I received 15 calls, 14 visits and five offers to buy the car for anywhere from $5,500 to $6,500.  We decided to wait a while longer before we buy another car so we did not sell it.

I would recommend this car to anyone that does not want to pay a ton of money for a car and wants to have fun driving their car.  I would especially recommend this car to high school or college students.  It is a great first car.
