            Where to begin....In June of 99' I bought a 2000 Neon ES. This is my 2nd Neon, my first being a 97 4-door &quot;Sport&quot; Model. Both boast the same road/road rage friendly fully independent suspension and lots of go-go juice. Though my current neon lacks the additional mechanical whoopee of the first one ( the 97 was the DOHC 150 bhp), coupled with the ultra-smooth 5-speed manual, this car boogies. Not many cars can show me their tail lights after a red light turns go (and go and go....) So as far as performance, lets just say its ahead of its class. Escort? Where? Oh, the rearview mirror thats right! The only spot its ever going to be! Its handles well on dry/wet pavement, though this first Michigan snow has proven the ES models Goodyears to be &quot;Goodsummersandsprings&quot;. Im sure that beefier tires are in this cars future to help keep it harnessed in the snow. Granted I opted for the 4 wheel anti-lock disc brakes and traction control....it is still a far cry from many other cars ability to track through snow. The seating position in the new Neon is commanding, slightly higher than the last generation....and the seats are oh so comfy.... The white faces on the gauges scream at you in a friendly &quot;Just making sure you know whats going on&quot; way....which means that &quot;Officer, I had no clue I was going 92&quot; will be a big fat LIE. And go 92 it will...with a little bit of wind noise but still completely composed. My complaints? A few rattles and squeaks I could live without...but hey they didnt give me a 6 speaker CD player with EQ for nothing....so I just turn it up a bit and like magic those squeaks disappear! You should try it sometime! That and the snow season are this Neons only flaws. Oh, and leather seating and a power sunroof would have been nice available options....oh well, its going to be in there sooner or later... This is a car for anyone who wants major bang for the buck, and there is such an array of colors it could match any personality/age group! Hope everyone who reads this gets themselves a little Neon. They make great decorations in any driveway!!<br><br>
