            I purchased my 1993 Saturn SL-1 in 2000.  Having never owned a Saturn before, I didn't know what to expect.  I was already apprehensive about buying an American vehicle.  Saturn is a fairly new car company and I haven't known many people who have owned their vehicles.  Overall, my Saturn has been a dependable vehicle and I've been very pleased.  At a purchase price of only $2,500, this car has been worth the money and possibly more.  The exterior looks great and I would still consider the vehicle attractive at almost 10 years old.  The interior, however, doesn't quite match the attractive exterior.  The front bucket seats are not very comfortable for long trips and do not recline or slide back far enough for ample foot room.  The center console with window controls is very poorly placed and difficult to get used to.  The trunk space is decent.  As far as quality goes, this Saturn doesn't quite live up to its Japanese counterparts: Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.  The plastic is not very durable and cracks easily.  This vehicle is very noisy at speeds over 40 mph.  The gas mileage is very good for a mid-sized car.    The transmission shifts very smoothly, except when the air conditioning is running.  With the air conditioning on, the car "jumps" and shifts poorly.  Oil consumption is another minor problem; oil seems to disappear, as there are no visible leaks, but the oil level is low when checked regularly. All in all, I would recommend a Saturn to someone looking to buy an American-made vehicle.  It serves well as a first car, but I wouldn't recommend it as a family car or a car used for frequent long travels.
