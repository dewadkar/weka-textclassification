            When our son was 9 months old it became clear to my husband and myself that our Altima (also a Nissan) was no large enough to carry us, our son and the number of other items that go along with having an infant.  We 
decided that it was in our best interest to purchase a minivan.  What a change that was for us.  Something we swore would never happen.  We spent a few weeks researching minivans online and decided to take a look at the Nissan Quest.  Sure enough.  The day we went we picked out a brand new 
2000 Nissan Quest.  I would have to say now that it was the best decision we have made yet in regards to our family.  The Quest came standard with a VCR and monitor.  The model we purchased had bucket seats in the middle and a bench in the back - all of which can be removed to provide extra cargo area.  We LOVE our minivan now.  Our minivan came with 2-toned paint, 6 disc CD changer as well as AM/FM, radio, cassette player AND single CD player all located in the dash.  It also has a sunroof, keyless 
entry, roof rack, separate controls (with the use of earphones) in the middle seats for music media....  The list goes on.  We love our Quest.  It was definitely an investment on our part as we are expecting baby #2 by the end of this year.<br><br>
