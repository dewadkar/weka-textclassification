            I have been searching the internet for weeks and weeks know for the best 400.00 dollar digital camera in the 2 megapixel field. I looked at Toshiba M4, Epson pc800, Nikon Coolpix 700 and a few others.

 My opinion is the coolpix stands out from this fixed lens class because of sharp image quality,a lot of manual control, outstanding Nikkor lens and a point and shoot Matrix metering that snaps pictures off again and again. I am a beginner but I operated a few digital cameras in the past and this one gets the job done with jaw dropping results and I am very picky when it come to Quality. Some people say this camera looks like a old 35mm camera but I think it is handsome in it own right. The Coolpix 700 has a hard plastic body that is very durable. Fit and finish is very good and fits in hand nicely with its hand grip on its right side. Camera is small and lite for easy travel with is very important but not to small for my big hands. Coolpix does come with a lens cap but it should come with a strap so you can't lose it. Nikkon gives you a wrist strap with I think it should have a second eye for a neck strap. They also give you a soft case which can go on your belt. 

The LCD is 1.8 in.and works well at 30 fsp. I found shutter button to be nicely placed at top right corner with the easy control dial surrounding it. The menus I found to be very easy to use with its folder setups with is up and down scroll buttons.You can view up to 9 images at one time and zoom in on each picture to check quality. Camera has 4 buttons on top for easy access to flash, picture compression, delete, self timer and distance. Theres also 2 buttons on rear to shut monitor off and menu control. Image quality is great with its 1/2-inch 2.11 megapixel lens. I can't say enough about its point and shoot matrix metering is hard to fool. You can shoot picture after picture and they come out very clear and sharp. The colors came accurate and bright. You have 2 image size 1600x1200 and 640x480. 3 compression ratios 1/4 fine, 1/8 normal and 1/16 basic. 

One thing I think is a must have is the uncompressed tiff format as compression can sometimes degrade a picture and if you do printouts of 8x10 you may need it. After useing for a week I did find some purple haze in high contrast areas as in most 1/2 in. CCD lens. I am sorry to say though camera only came with 4 AA batteries. If you are planing to do a lot of picture taking I would highly recommend to buy battery charger and NiMH batterys. Battery life in this camera is not as bad as some others. I got about one hour out of alkaline batteries with lcd on sometimes. Down loading to computer is slow with its serial port connection and if downloading Tiff files forget it. I went out and got a USB card reader and it is also a must have item. Bottom line is for the price and class of this camera if can't be beat.<br><br>
