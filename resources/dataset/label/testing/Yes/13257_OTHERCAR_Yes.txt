            My first car was a sea green 1983 V4 Cutlass Cierra. I thought I was driving the meanest machine on the road. The engine clunked, the car would start most of the time, and the steering wheel had more play in it than Maggie Simpson's Fisher-Price drive along. When it just wouldn't start anymore, I had to give it up.

I now drive a 1999 Honda Accord EX V4 with manual transmission. (It is my second Accord and third Honda, I drove a Civic before that). Let's just say, I think I have redefined my criteria for &quot;meanest machine.&quot;

Simply put, this new edition of the Accord is solid. Like most people who would buy an Accord, I wasn't too concerned about horsepower, torque ratios and turning radius. I wanted a reliable car, a car that got good mileage and that would give me most bang for my government-subsidized buck. I wanted a car I would feel good about since I spend way too much time in one.

Sure, my car is reliable. Like my previous Hondas, it has always started (I know, I'm jinxing myself).  This current car has taken me to New Orleans, Atlanta, Charleston, Miami, Key Largo, Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, Vero Beach, St. Augustine etc. without any troubles. In fact, the only maintenance I do is change the oil.

The car gets great mileage. I consistently get b/n 30-35 mpg on the highway and 25-30 in the city. The mileage does vary in the city depending how late I am. 

It's the bang for the buck category where the Accord shines. The key-less entry system (std with the Ex) has to be the greatest invention of all time. I have yet to turn my key to open my door or trunk. The ride in this car I first class--smooth, quiet and sporty, similar to the first edition Acura Legends. 

The engine is inaudible at idle, hums on the highway and tears up the steeper hills. The interior is ergonomically flawless and completely functional. I love the crisp clear displays for the speedometer, and the Honda people finally made the radio and clock displays readable when the headlights are on during the day.

Most importantly, I feel safe in my car. The brakes are outstanding on dry and wet pavement. I take comfort in the dual front airbags (a Honda Civic airbag saved my brother from some serious pain).  The headlights and high-beams illuminate the roads effortlessly. The car has enough power to accelerate out of uncomfortable situations on the highway. And, I feel good about the steel side impact bars.

For me, there are only a few things that I don't like about my car. One, the gear shifting nob is way too tall! Almost as tall as those found in pick-up trucks. This takes away from the sporty feel. Two, I'm looking forward to side impact airbags. Three, I wish there were a convertible version.

Who is this car for? 
Someone who wants value. Someone buying their first car. Someone who values safety. ( Sure it's not nearly as cool as BMW 328 convertible. In fact if I had the money, I would be writing a BMW epinion).

Who shouldn't buy this car? 
Those who want a sport car, a truck, or have way too much money.

I cried when I gave up my green car. I still have pictures of it. Sadly, I sometimes long for the feeling of my plush seats and the sound of my broken radio. But those days are gone and, I'll never drive a heap like that again, unless I also owned a Honda Accord.<br><br>
