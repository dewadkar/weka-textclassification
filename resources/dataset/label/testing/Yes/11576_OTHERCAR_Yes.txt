            <b>If you have read any of my articles, you would notice that I have a penchant for SUV's. There are many dissenters against this class of vehicles, but even they must admit that SUV's give buyers a commanding view of the road, the same errand-running capability of a mini-van, and versatility that cars just cannot match. Of course, not all SUV's are created equal........</b>

A group of us were on a road trip to Dallas in a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo LSE. The owner was nice enough to let me drive it all the way (was she really being nice?). The <b>LSE</b> is the Rodeo's top-of-the-line model, offering many luxurious features like leather seats, wood trimmed dash, alloy wheels, privacy glass, power moonroof, and dual map lights. A step down is the <b>LS</b> which comes well-equipped without all the frills of the LSE. The base <b>S</b> model does not offer a whole lot besides a weak 4-cylinder engine, although you can get a V6. I suggest you avoid the headache of option shopping with the S model and just get an LS.

The Isuzu Rodeo <b>looks very good on paper compared to the competition</b>: it offers a <b>great engine</b> (3.2L 205hp, 214 torque) that outmuscles the Toyota 4Runner (183hp), Nissan Pathfinder (which shares its 170hp engine with the Xterra), Ford Explorer (160hp), and Mitsubishi Montero Sport (173hp). It offers the <b>same amount of features</b>, although it does lag a bit once you get into the more &quot;posh&quot; levels (i.e., no power adjustable seats/automatic climate control). The Rodeo has <b>plenty of cargo space</b> (81 cubic feet). The Rodeo's <b>basic warranty is the best in its class</b>, offering you bumper-to-bumper coverage for 36 months or 50,000 miles instead of 36,000. The Rodeo's powertrain/corrosion warranties are also impressive, but what impresses me the most is that you get free emergency roadside assistance for 60 months or 60,000 miles. Many competitors either charge you for roadside assistance (and for less time), or do not offer it at all. On top of all of this, the Rodeo is quite a bit <b>cheaper</b> than any other makes that are comparably equipped. 

<i>UPDATE: The 2000 Isuzu Rodeo now has one of the best powertrain warranties around: 10 years/120,000 miles!</i>

But does the Rodeo measure up in real life? After a few days with the Isuzu Rodeo, I think it pretty much does.

<b>EXTERIOR:  7</b>
The Isuzu Rodeo looks <b>rugged yet sophisticated</b>. Isuzu did away with the angular look of the pre-1998 models and still managed to preserve the tough look while adding a bunch of refinement at the same time. So now soccer moms and off-roaders alike will be pleased with the new Rodeo's pretty, (and rough n' tough) face... 
The Rodeo is shorter in length compared to its competitors, and even shorter than previous generations. This reduces weight, and helps with parking.
The rear door swings out sideways towards the street, so loading from the curb is a breeze. A glass hatch may be opened alone, so you can load smaller items into the cargo bay. The rear-mounted spare tire gets in the way of this, and is a real pain once it's dirty. But Isuzu gives you the choice of your spare tire placement (under the floor or mounted on the back).

<b>INTERIOR:   8</b>
Having said that the Rodeo is shorter than it used to be, it may surprise you that interior space is not compromised. In fact, the new Rodeo has more room than previous Rodeos by 7 cubic feet. We were able to fit the four of us with our luggage quite comfortably with room to spare.
The finish is <b>not quite up to par with the pricier 4Runner or Pathfinder</b>, however. The carpeting seems like it can take some abuse, but I still recommend a cargo mat for the cargo bay. In all fairness, the Rodeo is a good deal cheaper, and that more than compensates its slightly inferior finish inside.
The seats themselves are comfortable, although I wish that power adjustments were available in the top-of-the-line LSE. My friend who owns the Rodeo complains about the lack of height adjustment controls. She loves the low step-in height for an SUV, however.
The dash of the Rodeo is very user-friendly, but I wish the radio was higher. The A/C is powerful and uses logical rotary dials. 
The 6-speaker stereo sounds very nice for factory, and the in-dash CD changer is a welcome option.
My gripe with the dash is the placement of the push-button 4WD: it's right next to the cruise control. I had to be careful not to push it. I was told, however, that if it is accidentally pushed over 62mph, it will refuse to engage. That's good news. 

<b>ENGINE:   9</b>
The engine of the Rodeo is indeed the BEST feature of the vehicle. There is <b>plenty of grunt</b> to just get up and go. At freeway speeds, it is very easy to pass somebody. Gas mileage for the Rodeo is 18 MPG city and 20 MPG highway.

<b>RIDE:   7</b>
The suspension of the Rodeo is <b>decent for the most part</b>. Watch out for uneven surfaces and potholes, however. The ride gets bumpppppy! I found this a nuisance once we were driving around town. But on the highway, the suspension feels sporty. You feel in control. Speaking of control, the automatic transmission of the Rodeo has two modes you can select: POWER when you need extra oomph for merging, and WINTER, which starts the Rodeo off in 3rd gear from a stop during slippery conditions, preventing wheel spin. The engine is much quieter than previous ones. Tire and wind noise are both still apparent but diminished. 

<b>HANDLING:   8</b>
The track of the Rodeo was widened by two inches, which helps in the handling category. The <b>wheels stay planted during moderate turns</b>, although I felt some lean and heard the tires squeal in sharper corners. 
The <b>ABS work very well</b> on slick surfaces, and brought our Rodeo to smooth, controlled stops every time. The steering is sure and responsive.
Overall, I feel that the <b>Rodeo is a fun SUV to drive</b>. The powerful, quiet engine and the wider track make a good combination for city driving or highway cruising.

<b>THE VERDICT: RODEO GETS MY THUMBS UP:</b>
The Isuzu Rodeo gets my strong approval. Despite its shortcomings, the price simply cannot be beat at the end of the year. The 1999 models have <b>great financing incentives</b> right now (0% financing according to Edmunds, 0.9% for 2000 models), and I highly suggest you look into them. Note, however, that this is where some of the problem is: you can only find the really good deals at the end of a model year. It's the same story for any car manufacturer, but Isuzu in particular seems to get really &quot;desperate&quot; at this time and dish out incentives like mad.
The Rodeo has seen <b>average reliability</b>. My friend's Rodeo has 4,820 miles on the odometer and there are no problems (I'll try to get updates every now and then). <b>Customer satisfaction is high for the 1999 Rodeos</b>- more than I can say for the 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer. If you are single, an active couple, or a family, the Rodeo just might suit your needs, and at a very reasonable price.

<b>AVERAGE SCORE: 7.8 out of 10
VARA'S PERSONAL RATING: 8.0 out of 10</b>

<b>[<i>UPDATE:</b></i> 5/18/00<b>]</b>
