            When our son was born, my sister gave us the Polaroid PDC 640 to use so we could send her photos of the new baby and every move he made.  We used the camera for a couple months and decided to buy one for ourselves.

We had never used a digital camera before this but I was surprised how quickly we learned to use this one and how easy it was to install and operate.  Everything we needed was included in the kit to get us started. 

The Polaroid 640 has a resolution of 640 x 480 with 24 bit color and that was just fine for us because we were using them for snap shots.  The pictures printed out okay if you didn't want anything larger than a 4x6 or 5x7.  The quality of the photos when we had them printed from an online photofinishing company were not that great.  They came back a little fuzzy and not very crisp or clear.  You can take up to 96 pictures if you use a lower resolution.  You know what resolution you chose by the number of stars, one through four, showing.

If you are interested in the specifics of the camera, the Polaroid comes with a 1/8" viewfinder so you can instantly see whether you want to keep or delete the picture.  I really liked having this option and the viewfinder was easy to see and offered a clear view.   You use the up and down arrows on the back to scroll the pictures.  All the controls are little buttons on the back next to the viewfinder.

This camera is nice for just pointing and clicking with the autofocus option.  The screen on top of the camera displays your resolution, whether you are on autofocus, how many pictures you have taken, and more.  It is just a little square under an inch in size.  You can turn the autofocus off and choose from a couple other selections like red eye reduction too.  If you have autofocus on then you just pick the subject and click, that's it.  This is how I used the camera the entire time we had it.  

The Polaroid comes with a 2 Mb smart media card to store your pictures and it is removable.  This card slides in and out of the side of the camera. 

Once you have taken your pictures, you upload them to your computer through a cable connection that comes with the camera.  The Image Maker software is made by Polaroid and was so easy to use.  You can view all your pictures at once as little thumbnails and pick the one you want to edit.  The software lets you rotate, crop, fix small flaws, and a couple other options.  When you are done then you can save them all as an album for viewing later.   

The camera kit also has the AC adapter for charging and we used it when we uploaded pictures to save batteries.  This camera is no different than our other one when it comes to batteries, it uses alot of them.  That has been our only real complaint with digital cameras.  

If you need a camera that is really easy to use and doesn't cost alot of money the buy the Polaroid 640.  It takes good snap shots and is really all you need if you aren't planning to be a professional.
