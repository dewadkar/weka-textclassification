            Earlier this month, I celebrated BMW day, representing one year of driving my BMW x5 3.0 It has been the most pleasurable year of driving in my life. The only exception might be the BMW Bavaria I had back in 1971 that disappeared under four feet of water when my dealer was flooded.

I remember the day my wife and I walked into the dealer, responding to an add for the BMW 330 Sport Wagon. We test drove that - it wasn't bad -- but then saw this vehicle on the show room floor. We had to drive it and one spin around the block and we were sold. 

Others have commented on the superb handling, safety, and rally like features of this car. It is everything they have said it to be: it is secure on the road, with minimal veer in the turns, has plenty of power (the 3.0 with its 225 HP engine is more than enough),it drives like silk and is perhaps the safest vehicle on the road today. But my greatest joy is how it performs long distance. I take numerous road trips (over 1000 miles) and this car makes those road trips go by in a flash. First, it has excellent driver location with a clear expansive view of the road. Second, has more than enough power to pass, which is especially useful on two lane roads, and the availability of the Steptronic gear shift makes going up and down hills easy. It is excellent on congested turnpikes, like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which can be tricky and hazardous.And it is roomy with wide comfortable seats. 

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the X5 as the safest SUV on the road, making it a "best pick." And the car is far less expensive to repair. The X5's estimated cost of repair in the Institute's 4 separate 5 mile an hour crash tests of the X5 averaged d $590, by far the lowest of all the SUV's tested (The Isuzu Trooper cost $2781, for example).

I read the Car and Driver report on the 4.4. which complained about hard steering at slow speeds and a bouncy ride on Michigan roads. I have had none of these problems, and I have driven those very Michigan roads. My guess is that is these come with the sport suspension and would recommend against this option for the average driver. Car and Drive preferred the 530 sport wagon, but the wagon does not enjoy the visibility and command of the road as the X5, nor is it as roomy or accessible.

I have had a few minor problems. Occasionally the automatic remote locking device does not work and the car has to be opened at the door. And once in a rare while the car stalls at slow speeds. Amazingly, I have yet to have the car serviced or changed the oil at 14,600 miles. The green indicator lights are still on and BMW won't let me get a serviced until they turn to yellow. The dealer does not seem at all surprised.

Do not be fooled by the base price. Most of the features you want are add-ons, with will bring a 3.0 from around $38,500 to $45,000 quickly, with a state tax added on top. Since the X5 is an SUV, the car does not qualify for a luxury tax, a nice dividend.I opted for the premium, climate and activity packages and avoided the sports package which is designed to stiffen the suspension. Again, I would recommend against the sports suspension for the average driver. My one regret was not getting the upgraded sound system which included two subs and two extra speakers. This combo makes a great sound. I will have to put in my own subs. Most X5s in stock do not have the premium sound which is factory installed and cannot be added later. The car does have a in-dash CD player, which is very handy. The Mercedes does not. It is Mercedes corporate philosophy that changing CD's in transit causes too may distracted driver accidents. 

It is true this car is expensive, but to me it has been worth every nickle. We are thinking of replacing my Acura Legend (a good car too!) and have yet to drive anything else we like as much as the X5 and we have driven a lot of cars including the Acura MDX, (and we did not like this car at all).The Mercedes E class might be the only alternative I would consider.  I can see two X5s in my garage and will be a very happy man.
