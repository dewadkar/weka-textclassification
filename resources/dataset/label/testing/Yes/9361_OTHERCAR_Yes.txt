            I was very hesitant to buy a digital camera, because I was really an experienced Nikon film camera user (starting with the S1 Rangefinder and continuing through the Nikon 6060. However, all my doubts have been satisfied. The new camera produces pictures as sharp as my regular Nikons, and the zoom lens is really adequate for most pictures. The add-on tele helps, too.  I really did not have to struggle to learn the best way to use the camera, as the instruction book that came with it was precisely organized and very helpful! Using my SmartMedia card and a Flash Path floppy disk converter, I spend my time on my computer producing beautiful pictures which I can change in many delightful ways, instead of travelling back and forth to the photo shop.  I can recommend this camera without reservation for those who prefer computer operation to haunting camera shop photo-finishers.
