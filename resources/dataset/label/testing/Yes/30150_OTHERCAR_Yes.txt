            I purchased a 1980 Corvette about 6 months ago. It was black with t-tops and roared with a Chevy's 350. I believe this is one of the best years Corvette ever had. The cars handling is pretty well, but the power behind this monster is un-believable. When i first drove it, it lit the tires in 3rd without using the cluth, and this was all stock. The 1980, 81, and 82 are all the same body style and basically the same engine. Go with the 80, the 81 is electronically carbarated and has the potential to have electrical problems. The 82 is a no no! It uses whats called a Cross Fire Fuel Injection System. This is a no no! This is trouble waiting to happen.
So if you looking for an 80-82, the 80 is the best way to go. Its a good car and will be a collectors item soon. Take care of it.
