            In the spring of 1998 my family purchased a 1997 Camry LE for a Hertz rent-a-car used car dealer. This car had been used by the company for 1 year and now had 24,000 miles on it. The Camry is very comfortable and seats 5 people and has leg room for adults riding in the back. The down sides of the car are the 4 cylinder engine which gets good gas mileage but just doesn't have the power. The car has a very good climate control system which keeps the car cold or hot very easily. I would suggest this car for anyone who wants an affordable car which can seat 5 people but doesn't need constant repairs or tune-ups.
