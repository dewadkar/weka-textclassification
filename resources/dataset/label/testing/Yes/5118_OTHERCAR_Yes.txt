            I have owned my Intrepid for a year and a half.  I have never been sorry that I chose this car.  At first I was a little leary because it was much bigger than I was used to.  (I drove a 1980 Ford Pinto)  I was afraid that the gas mileage would be bad, but my mileage is the same as my daughters, who drives a Ford Escort.  

The trunk space is huge.  The seat folds down and you can carry a lot of stuff.

I did have a problem with my car, but it is a 1994 and was used when I bought it.  My water pump went bad.  It leaked into the place where my timing belt is and corroded the pulley to the timing belt.  the corroded pulley tore up the timing belt and this was very costly to repair.  This could have happened to any type of car.  

If anyone every wanted a nice comfortable car, then the Intrepid is the way to go.  Not only is it comfortable, but it is classing looking as well.<br><br>
