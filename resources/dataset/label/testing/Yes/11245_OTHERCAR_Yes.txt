            I love this car!!  Never have I loved a vehicle before until this one.  We bought it with 15,000 miles on it and it currently has 67,000 miles on it. <b>We drive the HECK out of this car!!</b>  It is very comfortable and very reliable.  We have driven for days in this car without once getting sore behinds or necks.  We also have 3 kids and they fit in it quite nicely and the child safety locks work excellently. A great feature of this car (that we discovered by accident!) is that the rear seats fold down to expose the trunk, so you can haul anything in this car! And let me tell you, it has.  We've hauled everything from beds and bikes to 2x4s and drywall!!  

The reliability of this vehicle is unreal.  Never once have we not been able to count on this car.  We live in a VERY cold area and the temperature dips down to way below zero and the car would always start.  We have put over 50,000 miles on this car and <b>NEVER ONCE</b> have we had to bring it in to the shop (other than oil changes).  We have not had any problems with brakes or the like.  It is honestly the first vehicle I have ever had that I never have to think about.  Our only expense is gas and oil.  The gas mileage on this vehicle is excellent.  It seems like we rarely have to fill it up!!  

The interior is wonderful, very regal.  The exterior is regal also.  I feel pretty cool driving this car, let me tell you!  I have so many comments on this car.  I have also encouraged a friend to buy one also.  She's had it for about a year and she loves hers as well.  

Do NOT have any doubts about buying this car!! If you look in the dictionary under "dependable" you will see a picture of this car!!
