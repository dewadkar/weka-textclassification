            The 1998 Park Ave. was an excellent car, the 2000 is even better. I drive a lot of different cars each year. Partly from rentals, and partly from testing media fleet cars.  Media fleet is just a way that car makers get members of the media to drive their particular car so that we'll talk about or write about them. Obviously they hope the car gets recommended, but that doesn't always happen (Saturn LS1). I my case I appear on a weekly radio program about cars.

My First Buick Park Ave. was one that I actually paid to rent. This was in 1998. I drove it on an eight hour road trip.  Overall the car was very nice. Very comfortable seats, more than enough power, self dimming rear view mirror, remote trunk release, A/C vents for the back seat passengers, an excellent sound system, and more interior room than some apartments I've lived in.  On the road this car was like an old Cadillac, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Smooth and very quiet, I could actually talk to my wife without either of us raising our voices. Overall  the '98 Park Ave. was almost a perfect car.

I found three faults with the car. 1) The steering wheel, while comfortable at first, became UN-comfortable after only a few hours of driving. The hard plastic on the upper part of the steering wheel made my hands ache. 2)The volume knob for the stereo had notches. Not a bad thing in itself, but in certain instances one click up was too loud, while one click down was too low.  Sounds funny I know, but my wife also noticed the same thing. 3) The center console/cup holder was flimsy and confusing to operate.

Jump ahead two years to the 2000. As I drove the new Park Ave. I thought I was dreaming at first, so I pinched myself. Sure enough, I was awake and Buick had actually fixed everything I didn't like about the previous car.  Softer steering wheel, smooth linear volume knob, and a somewhat more sturdy center armrest/console/cup holder. Combined with the near perfect features of the previous car, the new Park Ave. is simply amazing. They obviously listened to their customers. Japanese and European cars have forced American car makers to get better, and this is a perfect example.

I am sure no one under 45 will consider buying this car. Too bad. With the Ultra package this is almost a perfect car.  It's rather large compared to todays Camry or Accord, even so, with the supercharged V-6 it really goes. Other than the size and styling, (it looks like a car my parents would drive) the 2000 Park Ave. is simply a great car. <br><br>
