            I work for a Fortune 10 company, repairing computer systems.  I work out of my car.  I have a car allowance and a mileage reimbursement so I can drive whatever I choose.  I was racking up a lot of miles on a 97 Ford Explorer with a thirsty V-8 engine and a rough ride -- and began looking for its replacement at 42 months.  I'd had enough.  This was all before the national hysteria over the Firestone tires and blowouts.  I'd put Michelins on it a year ago anyway.

I test drove everything under the sun including all the minivans, all the sport utes, and a few midsize cars.  I trade cars frequently and have owned, among other lesser marques, four Volvos and three Mercedes-Benzes.  I currently have a 95 E320 which is something of a benchmark car for comparison purposes.

The search ended at a small Ford dealership.  I had rented Tauruses (Tauri?) before and always asked the Hertz clerk to give me one with &quot;the dual exhausts&quot; because of the little hot rod engine.  I did not care for the oval rear window or the hideous oval climate control and radio panel, but these cars were roomy and fuel efficent and ran like stink.  They seemed built to take the abuse of a rental fleet.  Why not buy one for my own use?

I have a fully loaded 2000 Taurus SEL complete with a glass moonroof and leather interior.  It has the Duratec V-6 engine which is quite powerful.  I am tracking the fuel consumption on a spreadsheet and it scared me at first...the mileage was in the 14-15 range and at 5000 miles it is consistently above 21 now (and rising as the engine loosens up) in mixed city/highway driving.  It is a super good looking car, black exterior and tan interior.  I have enough room in the trunk for three tool cases, a laptop bag, and extra room for parts.  I appreciate the split folding rear seats for their practicality.  I live in Florida and even with the black exterior the AC is powerful.  I am 6 feet tall and well over 200 pounds and I have plenty of room.  The car has power adjustable pedals which is a nifty feature for the short driver in my household.  I would suggest that taller drivers considering a Taurus, rent one for a week to make sure the &quot;dead pedal&quot; your left foot rests on is not too intrusive, as your left knee will always be bent and you will get a cramp.

I got this car for a little over twenty thousand dollars.  If I can get 75000 miles out of this car in three years, I will be happy.

If I had it to do over again, I would have gotten the power seat on the passenger side and asked my dealer to take off the Firestone Affinity tires.  I considered the wagon model but I need to be able to lock my goodies away from prying eyes.  I would have also gotten the model without the Automatic Climate Control.  I love the simplicity of Ford's A/C controls, but this car has 15 buttons instead of 3 rotary knobs.  It's confusing at night to change the temperature.  I also got the Mach 80 sound system with CD changer in the armrest, which is powerful enough for my tastes.

I have the 5 passenger seating with the floor shifter.  This was my worst mistake.  The center console is too ovoid to be useful for any kind of storage.  The cup holder is cute but tall bottles tip over when turning a corner.   The whole console is a big space waster.  I had to mount my cell phone cradle on a pedestal which bolts into the floor because there was no place to lay it on the console.  The combination seat and flip over storage bin would have been more to my liking.  

The other nitpick is the trunk lid which has to be slammed shut ... it also has the type of hinges which will puncture luggage or break your eggs...a word of caution here.  Ford really got cheap on this one.  The light is on the right trunk wall.  It could really use two lights and a 12 volt power port like VW does so nicely in their cars.

The fuel gauge is deceptive, when the needle is a 9 o'clock position one would assume the tank is half full, in actuality it is nearing empty.  The low fuel warning light comes on when one gallon is left.  Beware!!

I would recommend this car to nearly anyone looking for a real value.  There are five different trim levels for every budget...get the larger V-6 if you can afford to.  This is a safe, popular car with a lot of features for the money.  It's a fine handling car for the money.  I have driven mine &quot;as if I had just stolen it&quot; since day one and it is none the worse for wear.  I just had the oil changed at 5000 miles and it cost me $60 including a tire rotate and balance at a Ford dealer.  I was in and out in less than 1 hour.  I can't say that I LOVE this car, but if I were to wreck it and total it tomorrow, I'd get another one just like it.
