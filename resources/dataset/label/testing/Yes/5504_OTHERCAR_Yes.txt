            We have a 1992 Chevrolet Cavalier that we received from my father in law 2 years ago.  This poor car has been in several accidents and has 128 thousand miles on it.  Believe it or not this car is still going and going strong! My husband has major plans on getting the body fixed and &quot;souping&quot; it up.  I must express though that this car is for a smaller family.  There are six of us and it tends to be snug on those long day trips.  In other cars I have owned I have found the door handles and roof covering on the inside to fall off real easily or in just a matter of time, but in this litle life savor of ours they are all still on tight.  Believe me with four kids this car goes through a lot and I really feel it will be with us a lot longer.  Not to mention the great mileage it gives us.  We fill it up and that lasts us a week, and believe me we go a long way in one week. <br><br>
