            The Saturn SC1 is a very economical vehicle.  The standard features on this car make driving easy and comfortable.  The manual transmission shifts smoothly and easily.  The third door is very convenient for people with larger dogs or children.  The controls on the SC 1 are placed within arms reach to almost any driver.  This car gets 300-400 miles to a tank of gas.  Not to mention that the maintice on this car is minimal. The only flaw I can find with this car is that when the headlights are on and you turn on your turn signals the headlights tend to reposition.  Over all this car is a great buy for anyone looking for a compact car.
