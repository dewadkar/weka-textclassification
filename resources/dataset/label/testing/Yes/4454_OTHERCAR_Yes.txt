            I bought a new Volkswagen Cabrio GLS last month for my 16th birthday from my dad's BMW, Porsche, Volkswagen dealership in Corpus Christi, Texas.  At first I was looking into a Saturn coupe, then I concidered the Hyundai Tiburon, but I finally found the perfect car!  I got it in Desert Wind (kinda a silver/ tan-ish color...very cool) with black leather.  It's the perfect car for our part of the country because the summers are HOT and the winters dont get warmer than 65.  It's the perfect car to cut school and drive to the Mustang Island beach with my friends (dont tell my parents lol). 
     First, the cons. (not very many though).  One of the biggest problems with EVERY Volkswagen at my dad's place is that the trunk release keyless entry almost NEVER works.  But the #1 problem is the CUPHOLDERS.  The front cupholders are only small enough to hold a small coffee or a soda can, but nothing bigger.  Also you can't have tall cups there because the dashboard controls interfere with it.  But, the single cupholder in the back is big, so I usually put my drinks back there and reach for it (inconvient but minor).  Also, it's a little hard to get leg room and distance from steering wheel to work together.  I'm tall (6'2&quot;) so that only amplifies the problem.  If I adjust the seat so I comfortablly reach the pedals, I'm too far brom the steering wheel.  This makes the person in the seat behine me a little ucomfortable.  Though the back seats are small, they're the biggest I've seen on any convertable (except the BMW 323Ci....but that's out of the price range of most teenagers starting at 32000).  Finally, I wish the cruise controls were on the steering wheel, but theyre on the turn signal arm so it takes getting used to. (one time i thought i set cruise control but i really made my blinker flash right)
     Now the PROS!!...  First of all, even though it's only a 2.0 115HP engine (convertables in same price range usually have stronger engines) its VERY nimble, sporty, and easily manuevers through traffic.  Another thing is the headlights!  My girlfriend thinks they're so cute..and I think they are too!  The interior lights are beautiful too!  at night they glow a soft blue and red against the black (very nice).  The heated leather seats are great when it gets cold in winter (and to us south-beach texans.. 65 is freezing).  The CD changer is great and easy to use.  Another great thing is the power top.  its VERY fast to take off and on so you can do it when youre stopped at a red light.  The one touch power windows are great!! i just touch the window controls and all 4 go down on one touch (thus the name..).  I wish they had rear window controls in the front AND back though...but they only put them in the front dash.  The backseat can fold down so you can increase the cargo space.  The trunk space itself is great (for a convertable)!!  I mean it's no Cadilac trunk but its a big trunk for a convertable.  But when its packed with luggage its hard to get to the CD changer. 
     SO---bottom line...this is a GREAT car for anyone (from 1st time buyers to retired people.)  i wouldnt recommend it for a family though.  but for everyone else...Buy it!!   -SJK
