            I was a little nervous buying a low end SUV back in '95 (or was it '94?).  Suzuki isn't exactly the leader in the market, but there is nothing I hate spending money on more than cars.

I live in Rochester, NY, and we got a lot of snow.  I also go up to the Adirondacks several times a year, so I definitely wanted a 4WD vehicle of some kind.   Nothing in the marketplace came close to matching the price of the Sidekick. 

This was a great little car!  It was fantastic in the snow.  There were many times when I was driving home from work in a blizzard that I passed a number of other SUVs that went into the ditch or off the road.

In the 4-5 years I had it, the only time I had it in the shop was to replace the windshield wiper fluid motor - no big deal.

Unfortunately, I had to trade it in recently because I needed a minivan with a growing family and all.  

The only negatives I would say is the ride is a little harsh (especially on the highway), and the body feels cheap, but that hasn't caused any problems.
