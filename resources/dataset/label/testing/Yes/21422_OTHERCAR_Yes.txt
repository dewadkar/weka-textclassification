                 I had been thinking it would be nice to have a second car, one that was cheap on everything. After speaking with a number of dealers, I found a 1999 Escort Zx2.. I liked it better than most of the other stuff, but my bank did not want to finance it because it has almost 100K... The he showed me a 2001 Elantra 5-speed with 42K..They wanted $7800 but they took $5500 for it..
     This is one of the best handling little cars I have ever driven. It can handle the curves goign 45 mph and never miss a beat.. Ths low profile 15" tires help this some, but also the power steering is well balanced for the car. It rides fairly well, bouncing and jiggling a little more then a Focus, but not a huge amount..I think it rides well for a car of this size. This is the best car for city driving, it can weave in and out of traffic very well and doesn't havd that many blind spots. The 2.0 4 has good power to it, esp. w/ the 5-speed... It isn't the best manual out there, but it is very easy to shift and drive.  
     The interior is made up of nice plastics, and fabrics... The equipment that comes with this car is a suprise. Mine is a basic GLS w/ the upgrade package. The cruise is in a very handy place and very easy to use with out taking your eyes off the road... I replaced the Factory Cassette Player w/ an Aftermarket CD Player, but the factory raido sounded good, what little I used it. The A/c is very strong, but I will reserve judgement on that till I can use it more. The heat works extremly well..The rear defrost and heated mirrors work quickly to remove any ice thats on them. The alarm annoys me, but I do enjoy the Keyless entry. The power windows work well also, but I do wish that there was a power door lock switch. 
       This a very good looking car. Mine is Champange w/Champange Cloth and it has everything anybody could want on a little car. For the value, you won't find another car w/ Dual front and side airbags..I have put 3500 MI. on the car and have had the door seals replaced under Hyundai warranty.. But thats was just a minor concern of mine..If your looking for a safe car thats Cheap, look no further..
