            I bought my '94 used in 2000 when I was actually looking for a Mustang.  Since I've already had a few convertibles I knew what to expect.  All convertibles leak a bit.  Maybe not brand new, but definitely after 5 yrs.  Mine leaked a bit, so I adjusted the top and it only drips a bit when I am driving in a downpour.  

The performance surprised me.  This car is surprisingly fast.  If you search around on the web you can find some easy & cheap modifications to make the car very quick.  I replaced the throttle body with a larger one, replaced the air filter layout and opened the exhaust a bit.  It still can't beat my old '97 Taurus SHO or '96 Mustang GT, but it will beat most other V6s.  

The transmission is typical of Chrysler/Mitsubishi.  It is pathetic.  I bought a powertrain warranty when I bought the car and used it to help pay for a rebuilt tranny.  Other than that it hasn't given me any problems.  

The front seats are comfortable, but it is a small car so 6ft+ people are going to have to duck when getting in and out.  Like all cars in this class the back seats are almost useless.  Maybe two small children on short trips, but that is it.

The car has considerable body twist and the ride is noisy.  With the top down it is even louder.  The fuel pump in the gas tank is loud as is the road noise.  It seems the car is missing sound insulation. 

The car has many options but is still somewhat crude.  It handles OK, is very fun to drive but remember...  It is not a luxury car.  It is a small sporty enconomy car.  

It has some faults but for the money and the fun it is an excellent car.  I am very pleased with my Lebaron.  This is the first Chrysler I've had and I am impressed.  Two of my friends have traded in their Mustangs (as I did when I bought this car) for Lebarons ('93 & '94) after driving my car.  The fact that their V6 powered Mustangs couldn't beat it probably motivated them a bit.
