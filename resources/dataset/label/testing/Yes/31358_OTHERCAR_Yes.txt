I recently got a 2002 Toyota Celica used from a private seller. after putting nearly 100 miles on it the first few days mainly from people wanting to ride in it, i learned the engine gets great gas mileage and still makes enough power to get going. This is my first manual transmission and i learned it in no time. The transmission is forgiving and runs smoothly. 

The car is quick but by no means a sports car. if your looking for a faster car but like the celica get the GT-S. with 40 more hp with a Honda like Vtech and weighing 2500 pounds its much more of a performer then the GT. 
The car gets good gas mileage something like 30 in the city and 40 on the highway wich is nice sence we are moving out of town and will be going back and fourth every so often. 

The looks of the new Celica are very unique. some people dont know what it is. To sum it up it looks alot faster then it is. The car i bought came with alot of aftermarket assecories from the previous owner which we got pretty much free of charge and makes it look even nicer. The stock tires already being fairly grippy are no match for the aftermarket ones though. the seats do their job of holding you in while looking and feeling nice too


CONS

The one thing i would say bothers me about my car is the rearview especially when parallel parking. you have to check all three mirrors in order to see the boundarys of your car. this is due to the timidly sloped hatch design.
To me, being in highschool, i really am not bothered by the lack of space. Road noise is noticeable especially on rougher pavements it seems if there is a hole in the bottom of the car to hear from. Once again not a big issue for me but if you are looking for a luxury car that is nice for long trips and comfortable all around look elsewhere. this car is perfect for college/highschool kids who are looking for something fun but not a flame shooting powerhouse asking to be pulled over.

CONCLUSION

I couldnt have picked a better car in my opinion. I love it and know since it is a Toyota it will be the best for reliability second only to Honda/Acura. I plan on having this car for a long time and advise it to anyone looking for something they can drive daily and have a little fun with on weekends.
