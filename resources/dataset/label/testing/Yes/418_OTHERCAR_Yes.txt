            First I want to say my wife thinks I&#146m a nut when it comes down to purchasing things&#133ESPECIALLY cars.  I do lots & lots of research on the product and then even more research on the price.  Hands down the 1996 Lexus ES 300 coach edition is one of the best cars I have ever owned.  I have always liked the Toyota products and my Lexus has all the quality Toyota can deliver.

Here is my quick story on this car.
I was driving my Honda Accord &#147Special Edition&#148 for the last 3 years and I swore I would never sell it.  One of the best cars I have ever driven with almost NO repairs at all.  I purchased a black Lexus ES 300 Coach Edition to resell.  I got a great deal on it and I would be able to turn it over for about a $2500 profit. (I was at the right place at the right time).  I purchased the car and put a temp tag on it so I could drive it for a while.  I was so impressed with this car that I started to question my loyalty to my Accord.  I went back and fourth for 2 weeks driving my Accord for a few days and then the Lexus.  My final decision was that the Accord would go and the Lexus would stay.  It was a rough decision but the Lexus clearly won out.  I also own a lot of my decision to the reviews on this site.  They made me very comfortable with my decision.

The drive is very soft but still handled great.   I also put on the Dunlop SP 5000&#146s tires.  This really helped the handling from the Michelins they had on when I picked it up.  It also shifts as smooth as can be.  Everything is where it should be and with 107,000 mi on the car, it still drives like a dream.  I&#146m a firm believer in getting a good deal, however, with this car, even if you went to your local dealer and paid full retail on this pre-owned Lexus (at the time I wrote this review a fair retail price is about $10,000) it would still be a steal compared to what you get in other cars and ESPECIALLY compared to a new car.

Yes&#133there is one thing I liked better in my Accord.  The Honda had a lot more little storage compartments and coin holders.  Oh well&#133a fair trade off.

My comment on the concern that the ES 300 is just an over priced Camry.  NO WAY!  It is smoother, quieter, more comfortable inside and looks sharper.  I know because I had a 1996 Camry XLE V6 before I had the Accord.  The Camry and the ES 300 are like night and day.  The ES 300 is a great bang for the your buck.
