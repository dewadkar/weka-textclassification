            This is my first digital camera and I have to say that I am very pleased with the results that I am getting with this model.I have read some of the other opinions for this camera and I agree with the majority of them. HP must have made some changes to this model and also the options that they package with it because when I bought mine it came with a USB connection cable and the AC adapter so that you do not have to use up so many batteries while you download, view, or send your pictures.  However, there is one change that they made that was alittle disappointing, and that is that they decreased the compact flash memory card from 8MB to 4MB but still even with this change you are still able to take upto 40 low resolution shots.  For a first timer with a digital camera I have to say that this is the one you would what to start out with, and maybe even stay with, I know that I will.  I see no reason to upgrade to a more expensive unit that if it ever broke you would be crying all the way to the repair shop to pay probably just as much for the repairs as you did for the camera. My HP200 cost me $169.95 at Walmart after I shopped around and looked at about 10 different models with the least expensive being about $275.00
