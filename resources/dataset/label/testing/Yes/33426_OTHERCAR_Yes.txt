            I have owned a Jetta since May when I first purchased the vehicle.  I was actually a driver of an '85 prior to purchasing the '99 model, so I am somewhat of a VW lover.  Despite this, This is very well built car.  The handling is tight.  The features are simple, yet very useable.  The car has a lot of mobility due to its smaller size and sporty build.  This car is seems smaller in the interior compared to others of its range, but the head room is higher in comparison and the trunk is very sizeable while still including a full-size spare.  The vehicle is reasonably spry, but with a standard 2.0 L/115 hp engine it does leave a bit to be desired.  This vehicle is definitely a car for a smaller person that is partial to smaller compact vehicles.  I have the GLS, so if you like a lot of fancy features, look at the GLX or another car.  Also, if you are looking for a lot power check out the V6 or another car.  This vehicle is more for a person that wants a reliable, well-built car that is efficient and will last for a lifetime.<br><br>
