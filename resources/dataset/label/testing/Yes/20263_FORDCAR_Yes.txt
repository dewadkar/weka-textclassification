            I bought this truck when my old one (a V.W.truck) had died. It turned out to be one of the best buys I ever made. It is a 98 Ranger  reg. Cab. It has a 2.0 letter engine, 2 wheel drive. Has a towing ability of 6000 lbs. It gets about 20 miles to the gallon in town. It has a 5 speed manual transmission. For a small truck it has just the right size bed 6x4 which holds just about anything you want to put in it. 
The truck drives almost as smooth as a car. Just a little bit stiffer ride, but would not give that up because if you went for a smoother ride you would have to give up on the carrying capacity. 
The only problem I have with the truck is that it is a little small in the cab. Not enough room for my wife and child. If you are buying a truck to drive all the time this is the one, but if you want to take the wife and kids you might think of getting the extended version, a lot more room for every one.<br><br>
