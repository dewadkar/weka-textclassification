            My husband and I purchased the 2001 Honda Civic EX a year ago.  We have had nothing but a great experience with the car.

This car was in addition to a 1987 Honda Prelude which my husband is still driving to work.  They just don't quit!:-) 
The Prelude was still running great, however we had a new baby and lugging the car seat into the small back seat was just too much.  Plus, my daughter was quickly running out of foot room and we knew that we were going to have to get a bigger car seat (we were still using the infant size).  There was no way either of us wanted to climb into that back seat to put her in the seat every time we wanted to go somewhere.
In addition, I had gone back to work and trying to get us both to our jobs and our daughter to my mother's house each day was just getting to be too stressful since all three locations were in different towns.  We needed another vehicle!!

So, we definitely wanted a car that had 4 doors and had a nice roomy back seat.  We loved the new design in the 2001 Civic with the hump gone in the back seat floor.   The back seat is very roomy and comfortable.  The rear cup holder is a great feature as well!  I love the pocket on the back of the front passenger seat.  I am able to keep all of my daughter's many books neat and organized in the car and I don't have to think about lugging a bunch of them out of the house every time we go somewhere.   The car seat anchors in the back seat were another feature that I really appreciated.  This is a great added safety feature.

The trunk has a very nice sized space with fold down seats if needed.  I am easily able to keep my daughter's stroller in the trunk with plenty of room left over.  My mother and I even go grocery shopping and fit all our groceries in along with the stroller!  

Now for the front seat:
I love driving this car!  I find the seats to be very comfortable.  The arm rest in the driver's seat is an added plus, especially on long trips.  

The CD player is great and works wonderful and sounds good too!  Love the storage area under the CD player.  Works great to keep all your CD's neat and organized.  

I find the heat and AC controls to be very easy to use and work wonderfully.  We had no AC in our other car and this was a great new treat. 

I did have a moonroof in the Prelude and couldn't do without it.  The 2001 EX came with the moonroof standard which was a great plus.  The AC is great on really hot days but on milder days, I prefer to have the windows open a bit and just love the sunroof.  I love the tilt up feature for just a little ventilation and have even used it on some milder winter days just to get some fresh air. 

The heater works wonderful as well.  It heats up very quickly even on bitterly cold winter days and before you know it you need to turn it down because you are too warm!

My husband and I are both big Dunkin Donuts coffee drinkers and frequently stop for a cup when we are out and about.  We love the double cup holders in the front.  I don't know how many times I ended up with coffee spilled on myself with the old car (we used to put our cups on either side of the emergency break handle.  Sometimes it was just a little too squishy of a space and there goes the coffee:-)  Having 2 cupholders is really great!!!

I also love all the little nooks and crannies for storing little items, i.e the change drawer, the bucket under the emergency break, the little slot with door (I keep my sunglasses here.  Don't have to worry about loosing them or sitting on them and breaking them.)  

The glove compartment is good size and holds a surprising amount.  The side pockets on either front door is a great idea as well.  

We have had no mechanical problems so far with the car whatsoever.  I continues to drive smoothly.  My husband loves checking the gas mileage when we go on trips to see if he can beat what we got the last time.  So far he has been very pleased.  I believe we are getting somewhere in the 32-35 miles on recent trips that we have taken.

I also discovered how great anti-lock breaks are!  I feel so much safer driving in snowy weather with them.

After driving the car for a little over a year, I can honestly say that the ONLY think about the car that I would add is a button on the front passenger side to lock all the doors.  If the driver stops somewhere to run into a store with the car running and you want to lock the doors, you have to lean over to the driver side door to lock all the doors.  Maybe Honda will add one in their future models.

I love Honda's and will definitely be a future customer.  It's competitors are also great cars but Honda win hands down when it comes to standard features!
