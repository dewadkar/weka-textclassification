            I just had to pop in here and give my opinion.
My 1998 Tahoe is the best vehicle I have ever had. It is comfortable, spacious and gets out of it's own way fast. 
I bought this truck new in 1997 and it has never been back to the dealership for anything but routine oil changes. My husband was a mechanic for years and is extremly fussy about the way his vehicles run. So believe me when I say this is a great truck to own.  
If you want a dependable truck that has style and comfort then the Chevy Tahoe is for you.
Gas milage is another story, although it is pretty good on a trip.
My husband always said, &quot;gas and oil is cheaper than machinery&quot;. So if your undecided~Go for it :)<br><br>
