            The Acura NSX is by far the best exotic car for your money, as compared to Ferrari's, Porsche's, and other exotic cars.  This puppy comes with a V6 250 horsepower engine that can bring the car from 0-60 in a mere 5 seconds.  Want the car to go even faster?  There are many tuning companies out there which can redo the engine and suspension to bring the 0-60 time down closer to 4 seconds.

This car is worth you money, for one, because it a achieves great gas mileage for an exotic car, approximately 17 mpg city, and 24 mpg highway.  The car has a great drive.  It drives smooth, corners good, and best of all accelerates fast.  When you accelerate in this car, you get pushed comfortably into the seats.  You can really feel the acceleration, and I like that.  Another thing is that you can feel the road.  The car feels like it stuck the road, which gives the driver a greater feel of control.

This is by far the best sports car out there.  It drives good, it is comfortable, and it attracts lots of attention.  I love it, and you will too.<br><br>
