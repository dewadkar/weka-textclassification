            If you need a car that gets you from here to there, but you wouldn't mind turning some heads in the process...then this is the car for you. Its great on gas, and yet at the same time will get you off the line pretty quick with it's turbocharged 4-cyl engine. The handling is incredible. And the look and sound system is premium. Everyone was in disbelief when I told them that the tires were already on the car from the showroom. The short shifter is by far the smoothest I've ever driven for any car in its class. They even made the shifter stylish by stitching the boot of the knob in yellow to match the stitching on the steering wheel and seats. The details really make this car a step above the rest. The pedals, shifter, and mats all have MazdaSpeed written on them. The sound system is unbelievable. It's far more than just a cool-looking face in the dash. First off, it truly is a great folding, detachable, Satellite ready radio face. But the fact that it has a 450-Watt amp and 8-inch Sub in the trunk to accompany it makes a world of difference is clarity and power. The engine is perfect for a person to me. I've had a 4.0 liter V8 before I owned this car. Besides getting killed on gas, the car was big, and not made for a person who commutes daily. This car is powerful enough, gets 30+ miles to the gallon, and is only a 4 cylinder. The supercharger is the perfect supplement for the engine. The body is sleek and stylish, and it is simply stunning in yellow, which is the color I had to choose. For the money, you can't beat it.
