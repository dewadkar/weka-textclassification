            I'll admit, at first I didn't really like the new design of the Honda Civic, but when it came down to the best car in the 17 thousand and under range, it was a sure buy. And the look, I grew to like. I have the Honda Civic EX coupe, which is offers the most among the DX, HX, and LX models. The thing I like most about the car is although it only cost me 16 grand (Year End Honda Clearance), it had a standard cd-player, power sunroof, power windows, power locks, and power mirrors (standards on EX model only). I'll admit the 6 speaker audio system isn't exactly bangin', but it's still more than I expected in a stock system. The 127 HP, VTECH four cylinder engine found in the 2 DR Civic EX wont put a reef on your neck and a bottle of wine in your hand, but it'll sure get you where you need to be without sacrificing fuel mileage. The fuel mileage on the EX is 30/38. I believe thats for all coupe models except for the HX, which gets something like 34/42. You dont even have to get an oil change until every 10,000 miles. Most civic owners swear the car's trouble free.

Being 6'1, I didn't expect to have the best seating position in such a small car, but I find that I fit perfectly, with little difficulty getting in and out. The trunk space is ample, and you can fold down the rear seats to give you even more room. The steering wheel does tilt, which is great. Your drivers seat adjust, however it does so manually. 

The car's got everything you expect in a coupe under 20 grand. Smack on a good warranty, a few good options, and you've got proof that big things do come in small packages from a company name thats synomonous with reliable.
