            I decided to do a review on the least expensive version of the <b>Porsche Carrera Coupe ( 2001 Model )</b> after a weekend trip from San Antonio to Dallas and back. I have driven many other models in the past and they keep getting just a little better.The Carrera 2 will cost you $67,265.00 for the <i>base model</i> which includes transportation.

First, a little <b>Porsche History</b>. Although most people assume that <b>Porsche</b> autos were a German contribution, the car was the baby of an <i>Austrian Inventor</i> named <b>Ferdinand Porsche</b>. The first of his inventions to carry the <b>Porsche Moniker</b> was an electric/battery powered car named the <i>Lohner-Porsche</i>. It used his electric wheel invention and was built in 1900. Next he became an engineer at <i>Daimler Co.</i> and was instrumental in the creation of the <i>Mercedes S</i>. In the 1930's he designed the model of a car which eventually became to be known as the <i>Volkswagen Beetle</i>. After WWII, <b>Ferdinand Porsche</b>, along with his son and daughter, started the present day <b>Porsche Co.</b>. In 1948 the first <b>Porsche 356</b> was born in Austria. Three years later <b>Ferdinand Porsche</b> died and his son, <b>Ferdinand Porsche Jr.</b> took the reins. Finally, the <b>Porsche 911 Series</b> made its debut in 1963. It is still the best selling <b>Porsche</b> of all time.

The <b>Porsche Carrera Coupe</b> in its base form ( hard to say base form with a Porsche ) has quite a healthy pedigree. The 3.4-liter flat horizontally opposed water-cooled 6 cylinder pumps out 300 horsepower with 258 foot pounds of torque to the rear wheels ( <b>Carrera 2</b> ). It will accelerate from zero to sixty in less than 6 seconds and will top out at around 150 miles per hour. The rear located engine delivers excellent traction to the drive wheels ( the weight is over the wheels for great traction ). The short throw 6-speed manual is very precise and well spaced (The exgirlfriend drove a stick, Thank God). Speed and Power are the things that you notice first with this Coupe. Other features that you appreciate later are the great brakes, crisp and confident handling, fit and finish ( German Quality ) and the extra features. The suspension up front is an independent Mac Phearson Strut system with aluminum control arms ( to save weight ) with coil springs and a stabilizer bar ( to control body roll ). The rear suspension is an independent multi-link system with stabilizer bar, coil springs and a self stabilizing toe in/out system. The Base model comes with four wheel anti-lock discs at all four corners, dual front and side air bags, fog lights integrated in the headlights, power windows and door locks, climate control, heated side mirrors, anti-theft system, heated windshield washer nozzles, carbon-filtered ventilation system and a great electric sunroof. Some weird features that still baffle me are the partial leather seats and the AM-FM Cassette. I do have to admit that the seats ( front only ) are very comfortable. I am about 5'11" and 210#s and the support from the seats was excellent for the 600 mile round trip. Getting out of the car wasn't too bad even though it sits lower than most cars on the market. Of course, you get the speed activated rear spoiler which raises for extra downforce after about 45 mph.

Two options which are worth mentioning are the <b>Tiptronic Automatic</b> and the <b>Technic Package</b>. The <b>Tiptronic</b> gives you the ability to shift the car manually without using a clutch. The <b>Technic</b> gives you the ten speaker CD stereo upgrade along with headlight washers, on-board computer and high intensity headlights. These two option packages will really dress up your Coupe.

The <b>Porsche Carrera Coupe</b> is an extremely reliable car with impeccable credentials. It gets decent mileage ( 17 city/25 highway ). Although it has a back seat, it is not user friendly ( who cares ). The trunk up front is great for an overnight stay for two, but no more. All in all, it is still one of the most beautiful cars made today and is probably worth the $70,000. It is still one of the benchmarks for sports car performance. Of course, if you require about 145 more horses you can get the Turbo Model.
