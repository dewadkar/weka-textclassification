            I had researched, researched, researched--OK, I'm an internet junky.  I was looking for a very small car, hatchback (for the dog), short in length (I have only street parking in San Francisco), and as cheaply as I could buy a new--but reliable and good quality--car.  I loved the look of new Beetles--but overpriced for me and terrible use of space (I once had an old beetle).  Finally settled on Honda Civic, but couldn't quite swing the price, and couldn't get over the boring look and boring color choices.  So I got interested in the Lanos.  No track record here in the states, of course, but for the price I was willing to take the chance.  So three days ago I bought it at the grand opening of a new dealership here.

I have to say I think (so far) it's fantastic!  Drove it around all weekend (down the rugged California coast).  It's solid, seems incredibly well-built, looks snazzy, and rides--and drives--great.    It's an automatic, and negotiates the steep hills of this city fine.  The radio/cassette player is more than adequate for my tastes (and I'm a professional musician), and the A/C was plenty sufficient.  Okay, I'm not either a speed- or power-demon, but it seemed to be just fine out on the highway.  What surprises me most is that it's so inexpensive, but does not seem at all cheaply built.

Time will tell, and it's very early yet.  I'll let you all know more later.  But my initial impression is it's pretty awesome.<br><br>
