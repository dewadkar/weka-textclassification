            Just about three weeks ago, I purchased a brand new (2001) Nissan Pathfinder. I had been in the market for a good work truck with decent towing capacity for quite sometime, but was reluctant to part with the near 30,000+ dollars it cost to park one out front. Dealerships Aren't interested in selling you a truck you can work out of anymore, It's all about the luxury SUV and most manufacturers cater to that with the amount of models they are producing in that class. The Pathfinder is still a truck, at a reasonable price with a very good option package. The truck was on sale @23,399. I got the manual transmission with 4X4 (10 more horse over automatic), power windows,locks, factory alarm, and the Bose 6 disc in dash stereo/changer. Pretty much everything you would need or want in a vehicle you plan to haul things in that are heavy and dirty. 
I have just over 1000 miles on it and couldn't be happier with it. Excellent ride for a truck, very quite, and super solid feel. Like any truck it's front end doesn't quite give back that positive feel and the body does roll into high speed corners. You have to take that into consideration when buying an SUV. It wont ever feel like your car. The vehicles dynamics are completely different. 
My suede-like cloth interior is very comfortable, with a fully adjustable driver seat (manual adjust.)Plenty of room to carry my friends around, or tools. I would like a bit more head room though, but overall I liked it more than my buddy's 4 runner which he also bought new this past summer. The one real problem I have with the truck is how notchy the gearbox feels, and the feel has nothing to do with it being broken in or not. Nissan standard gearboxes all feel the same, the long shift lever doesn't help the condition in any way. 
The truck is a sound investment as long as you don't get into all the flashy options that the dealer can tack on. Brush guards and tow hitches are alot cheaper from the specialty shop than the dealer. The Pathfinder is a truck you should buy and use hard, it can take it. If your keeping up with the Jones', get a truck that wants to be a car.
