            I think the largest question to ask here is Truck or Minivan?  The Frontier is marketed as a truck with room for four passengers.  Those who purchase the Frontier to use as a truck are going to be sorely disappointed with the lack of bed space.  Due to 
e elongated cab, the bed is shortened.  Even with the tailgate down, there is still not enough bed to haul a full piece of drywall, or a 4 x 8 piece of plywood.  Essentially, the bed is nothing but an open air trunk.

The increased cab space is marketed as a crew cab.  In actuality I cannot see a full crew of grown men comfortably riding in the Frontier.  Although it has 4 doors, the two rear seats are no larger than the rear seats an extended cab pickup.Overall, when considering the purchase of a crew cab Frontier, one must ask do I want a truck, or a minivan with an open air trunk?    <br><br>
