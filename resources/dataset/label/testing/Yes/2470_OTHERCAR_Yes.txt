            I bought my 2000 Chrysler Concord Lxi in June of 2000.  I bought it used for $17,000, with 14k miles on it.

Since I have had the car, I have not had any problems with it.  It came with just about every option except a sunroof.  I have to say, after driving this car for 7 months, it is every bit as luxurious as a $35,000 Mercedes or BMW.  I have owned a BMW before, and this car drives just as nice.  

There is plenty of room in both the front and rear seats.  The stereo system is one of the better factory systems out there.  I would like to point out that Chrysler has really upped their stereos in the entire line-up of cars and SUV's that they offer.  The nice thing about it, I paid $17k for a car that has all the options that a $30k import car would have.  Purchased new, I think the Concord runs in the lower to mid $20k depending on if you get the optioned out Lxi model, or the lower end Lx model.  The other difference between the two models is the engine.  The Lxi has the larger 3.2 liter 6 cylinder engine, and the Lx has a smaller 6-cylinder engine.  The factory warranty for the Concord, as with all Chrysler products is 3 years or 36k miles, which ever comes first.

Finally, in my opinion, Chrysler has really hit the nail on the head with the new body style.  I have been told numerous times how classy the car looks.  Also people have compared the design to the Jags of the 1950's &amp; 60's.  Once again, I think Chrysler has done a great job across the board with the new body styles on the LHS, 300M, Jeep Grand Cherokee, etc...  Overall, I have been very impressed with this car.
