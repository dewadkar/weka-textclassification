            My parents purchased this vehicle, however, I've driven it enough to know that it's not for me.  If I lived in an area that was flat, with no hills, this might be a good choice.  I live near Pittsburgh, and have to drive my Mother into the city every so often, usually we will take her Tracker.  I feel that the engine puts too much effort into having to climb some of the hills around here.  I also have a hard time while going up a hill keeping a consistent speed, the gas pedal feels too stiff for my comfort.

The steering is fine, and handles well around corners and bends.  While driving it, I do not get the feeling of rolling over.  However, this is not to say it might if you are one to speed around, which I would not recommend doing.  

The seats are comfortable, yet I do not think they would be comfortable for a long trip.  A few hours at the most is all I could stand to be in them.  I feel the inside could be a little more roomy for people.  Even while driving I feel a little squished in, I have not rode as a passenger in it.  The back seat looks cramped also.  Although I do feel behind the back seat is fairly roomy for groceries and it's easily accessible via the back door.  The back seat will also fold down to make even more room if you have to haul something large.  

The height of the vehicle isn't the best for parking garages, especially if you also have the luggage rack on top.  Numerous times I've scrapped the top of it trying to park in a garage in the city.  So, I'd recommend if you travel in a city and use parking garages a lot, do not get the luggage rack on top.

Mom loves her tracker for the comfort of putting things in the back.  She is also a smaller person, so it's comfortable seating for her, and she can see more over the top of the hood, for better visibility of the road.  So, from all the things that I know about the tracker, and what I use a vehicle for (long distance travel, city travel, etc.), I would recommend this one for people who do not drive far from home, are small, and do not have to go on very many large hills.
