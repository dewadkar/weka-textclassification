            We have owned our 2003 MDX for around 6 months.  We purchased from the local dealer and we really couldn&#146t negotiate much more than $1100 off list, dealer installed options at dealer cost, and we negotiated the extended warranty price down significantly.  The MDX is still in high-demand and they don&#146t need to discount too much but they will if you push them.

We compared the car against the new Volvo SUV, Mercedes SUV, Toyota&#146s SUVs, and Lexus&#146s SUV.  For the value of options vs. price, the Acura MDX was our choice.  We got the Premium model that included features like rain sensing windshield wiper, better tires, 6-CD in-dash changer, roof rack, memory seats, and a few other options.  The upgraded Premium package is probably not worth the additional cost (vs. the Standard) but I really wanted the navigation system.  The navigation system is really a $2000 toy.  But I am gadget freak and usually keep my cars around 8-10 years so I bought it anyway.

I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy the navigation system and it has come in handy when we travel but if you trade cars regularly, you will not get your money back on this feature.

Out of the SUVs we compared, I believe the Lexus had the best ride.  We drove their new model RX330.  I also liked the automatic rear door remote feature.  The Mercedes was a very solid ride more like a truck.  In fact, the salesperson kept referring to it as a truck.  The new Volvo was quite nice but the ride was noisy.  It also seemed a little cramped inside.  Since the Volvo is so new, there is a wait list and no negotiation room.

Comparing the features, ride, and price of the Volvo, Mercedes, Lexus, and Toyota, the MDX was a clear choice.  Features such as: paint color, premium sound system, heated seats, sun roof and others were additional costs on competitors where they were included on the MDX.

The gas mileage seems worse than it is.  On the trip computer, we average 17 in the city and around 21 on the highway.  I think it must have a small gas tank because it seems like we fill up often.  That mileage isn&#146t bad compared to the others in this class.  You need to remember that it uses 4-wheel drive often (on every start) and takes more gas.  Mercedes has 15 in the city on their sticker.

We did our research on safety and Acura ranked very high.  Also, all of the technical reports and professional car reviewers ranks MDX highly.  If you look at the reputation of Honda with longevity, you can bet this vehicle will last.  We did seem to get pressure to buy the extended warranty and I originally said no.  They keep stressing how many computers that were in the vehicle and I finally talked them down around 35% and ended up buy it.

UPDATE - - -  8 months old . . . .

We have had the MDX for 8 months now and have taken two major trips.  I am very glad we got the navigation system.  It comes in handy when you are trying to find restaurants, banks, and shopping.  You can even put phone numbers in the system and it will find it for you.  It is a very expensive "toy" but if you keep your car a long time, I recommend it.  You may wish to investigate the "portable" GPS systems that they selling now for $300-$400 at most electronics stores.  I haven't used one yet but is if a lot cheaper than buying one installed.  With the portable unit, you can take it with you in any car or rental car.

We didn't purchase the DVD system and we are glad we didn't.  I bought a little portable unit for $300 at Best Buy.  We have used it as an extra unit at the house and we use it in the MDX for long trips.  We simply plug the unit in the cigarette lighter and it is fine.  

The gas mileage is really the only complaint I have.  I am sure it is no worse than other SUVs but we are averaging around 16 per gallon in the city.  I asked the dealer about this and he said that after 8000-10000 miles, we should start getting better gas mileage.  The highway mileage is averaging around 23-24 miles.

I still would buy another one of these!  They are great driving cars with lots of options.
