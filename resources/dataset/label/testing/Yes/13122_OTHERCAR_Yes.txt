            A little less than one year ago I was in the regrettable position of having to get a car.  The regrettable side came from the fact that it had been 8 years since my last vehicle purchase.  Every vehicle I looked at had those &quot;have to have&quot; features.

I test drove the Dodge Intrepid, Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac Gran Prix and Chevrolet Lumina.  The Lumina, Grand Prix and the Intrepid were in the same price range (18,000 - 21,000) and the Malibu was a bit less expensive.

When I drove the Lumina, I immediately noticed how much smoother the ride was versus the other vehicles.  While the Intrepid offered much more leg room, the Lumina was very smooth.  The Grand Prix was comparable to the ride, but something about cars made by Pontiac just give feelings of &quot;cheap.&quot;

The features on the Lumina included: built in stereo controls on the steering wheel, something I was not crazy about, but has been a great feature.  Power everything, cruise control, AM/FM CD player with volume control based on speed of car, temperature controls for the drivers side and passenger side.  It also seemed as though the trunk on the Lumina was bigger than the other cars.

Driving this car is great.  It does very well on gas mileage.  I drove the vehicle cross country and loved every second of it.  Had absolutely no problems, it did great on mileage and was very smooth.<br><br>
