            Having owned both the 1999 ML430, and my new 2000 ML430, I am probably a pretty good judge of quality, (I hope!).  

I purchased the 1999 in May of 99.  I loved it immediately, but that feeling subsided after two trips of over 1000 miles.  There were creaking noises in the cabin, the ride turned awful (in town),and I became bored and irritated with the cheap interior.

In May of 2000, I purchased the 2000 ML430 by special order.  I loved it then, and am happy to say that I still do!

Most of the noticeable changes are within the interior.  The leather seats are more supple and supportive, there are 3 position memory switches for both driver and passenger. The dashboard has been softened, and the carpet pile has been increased.  Overall, there is a much warmer, luxurious appeal in the cabin.

Technophiles, (like myself) will be much happier with the 2000.  The ML430 comes standard with the GPS navigation system.  I have used this extensively and, for the most part have been pleased.  It is incredibly handy when in a large, unfamiliar city, and you have no idea how to get downtown; just for one example.  However, the routing preferences could stand some improvement.  Unfortunately, the user is limited to either "Maximize Freeways," or "Minimize Freeways;" there is no in between.  I must add, the GPS system was not designed to replace maps, or common sense!

In addition, the GPS system is integrated with the optional cell phone, Bose Stereo, cd changer, etc.  There are on-screen menus to navigate everything.  There is ONE FEATURE of the stereo that I love, there is an "auto programming" feature for radio preset stations.  When you leave any area, and the stations become "fuzzy," you simply auto scan the airwaves for the 10 strongest stations.  Really handy!

The ML430 is an all-time four wheel drive vehicle. However, I rarely take mine "off-roading."  If I liked going off the beaten path, I would NOT take my M-Class, nor would I encourage anyone else to do so either. On the unpaved roads I have traveled, the ride has been rough and a tad uncertain.  In my opinion, this vehicle was not created to traverse canyons and stream beds, and that is certainly NOT why I purchased it. The ML430 is most rewarding on the open road. However, as for a snow vehicle, it is absolutely, positively the best Car or SUV I have ever driven! 

Addressing former reliability issues; so far so good.  I have not had any problems.  The cabin is quiet for the most part(especially when compared to the 99's), and the ride is still smooth, yet firm. 

My decision to purchase another ML430, after not having been totally impressed with the 1999, was based on two factors; high trade-in value, and customer service.  My experiences with the dealership's service department have always been stellar.  Unlike other dealerships I have dealt with, I am always appreciated, and my concerns are promptly addressed. 

Updated February of 2001: While I still stand behind what I have written, I have traded in my ML430 on a 2001 Toyota Landcruiser.  While my Landcruiser is superior to the Mercedes in build quality; the Toyota is $13,000 more. I thoroughly enjoyed my M-Class but desired something a little more substantial.
