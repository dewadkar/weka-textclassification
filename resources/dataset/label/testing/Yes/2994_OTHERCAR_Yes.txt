            The Jeep Wrangler is more than just a car.  When you drive it, you are entering a family.  All other Jeep owners wave to you when you pass them on the road.  Its is like you belong to a secret that only Wrangler owners know about.  The power of this beast is amazing.  It handles well in snow, mud, rain, ice, and on virtually every other surface.  Owning a jeep has been a great experience for me because the thrill of driving it in the summer with the top off makes it extremely easy to pick up chicks.  It is a chick magnet.  Even if the girl has no interest in you, she will do anything for a ride in your amazing car.  Beleive me, Wranglers are the ultimate in driving experience.  Just ask anyone who owns one!!!<br><br>
