            We bought our dark blue 5-seater 1990 Dodge Caravan SE in 1993, with one previous owner and 50000 km on the clock.  We had two children at the time, and were starting to outgrow my beloved old '81 diesel rabbit.  We had been looking at minivans for some time, and the opportunity to buy this came from a colleague who was upgrading to a Suburban.

The SE 5-seater version is very comfortable.  The seats are covered in a tough but soft blue baise fabric which is holding up well.  The seats are comfortable for long journeys, and here in Western Canada, many of our journeys have been over 1000 km at a time.  I like the high sitting position, which is easy on my back and lets me see over small cars in front.

We have the 3-litre Mitsubishi V6 motor, now with 170000 km, with 3-speed automatic transmission.  It has plenty of power both in the city and on the highway.  We tow a heavy tent-trailer in summer, and though I can feel the weight of it, and we are not the first away from the lights, nevertheless there is enough power.  Our motor now smokes when cold, but when it has warmed up it is OK.  My mechanic friend tells me that the valve guides on this motor can wear and allow oil into the cylinders.

The air conditioner has worked well without a glitch.  We certainly need it in summer - it gets very hot here.  Even better, the heater is strong, and since our winters are downright nasty, we need good heat.

The car came with a standard stereo and tape deck, and it sounds pretty good in the front seat from the multiple speakers in the door panels and the dash.  However, sound is not clear for the passengers.

The rear tailgate is very heavy, and is raised by gas shocks.  We have needed to replace these every two years - easy to do at home, and we bought a pair with a lifetime warranty from a local parts store, and have gone back 3 times to get a free replacement set.  They must be cursing us for hanging onto our car for so long.

The radiator failed this summer, and had to be replaced (for Canadian $400 or US$270).

We have had very little mechanical trouble from this vehicle other than the 10-year old radiator, the tailgate shocks, and the window glass rail in the drivers door.  We have changed the oil regularly, but very little other maintenance.

We did have trouble with the paint, starting last year.  We have the metallic blue paint, and it started to peel off from little stone chips.  By last summer, our car looked like it had an attack of leprosy, with paint peeling off in sheets.  Very ugly.  The local Chrysler dealer was very unhelpful;  he was not prepared to help us in any way on a 10-year old car.  I have nothing good to say about the Chrysler dealership, but I cannot criticise this car for this.  I solved the paint problem by buying a can of matching paint from an auto parts supplier, and picking away the loose paint, and brushing on a film of paint.  It looks amateurish close-up, but from a distance it is OK.  We have no rust yet.

This is now our second car (the other is a 1996 Plymouth Voyager) but I prefer it to the newer one.  It has a more solid ride and is more comfortable.  

This is a good car for a family, and for carrying furniture.  However, given that it is getting a little long in the tooth, it would be best to have a mechanic in the family.

When we buy our next car, I will look hard at another Chrysler minivan.  So far we have been generally pleased with the vehicles, although we hate the dealers.<br><br>
