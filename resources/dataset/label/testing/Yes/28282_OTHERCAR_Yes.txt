            I purchased my first SUV and it was the Dodge Durango.  I needed a larger car since I was pregnant and my old car, a thunderbird,  simply wasn't enough room for my &quot;expanding family&quot;.  Although the price can be scary, it is well worth every dollar simply due to it's high standards of safety, and this made my decision simply based on that for my child.  It has a few drawbacks however like the gas mileage and slight difficulty in navigating the durango for the first few drives, but I got used to the driving in a matter of days and now I can back up and do all sorts of maneuvers with this SUV.  With the 318 standard engine, allows you to have a greater acceleration versus the 305 engines so that is definitely a plus.  The Durango's design is simply wonderful and looks like NO OTHER suv on the road.  I bought this brand new and special ordered my durango and now it is 1 year old and still the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I only recommend this type of vehicle that can really take advantage of it's extended room inside.  This vehicle is perfect for a family and the space inside seems endless!!
I rate this vehicle as being the best made vehicle with the highest safety measures on the market today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I LOVE YOU DODGE, CHRYSLER and PLYMOUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
