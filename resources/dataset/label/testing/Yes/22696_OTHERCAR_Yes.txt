            I bought my 1995 Plymouth Neon in 1999.  I was only about 14 years old when the Neon first came out, but was really enamored of the cute ad blitz Chrysler did (Hi!).  In college, the little Toyota my parents had given me in high school died for the last time, and I had to purchase a new car.  Since my affection for the Neon had stayed with me for years, I went straight to the Dodge dealership to look at used Neons.  I decided to purchase a blue 1995 model that looked great, drove nicely, and was in my price range.

Since that day, I have been happy with the overall quality of my Neon.  It now has more than 150,000 miles on it and a cross-country move under its belt.  (I packed my whole life into that car with room to spare and drove from L.A. to D.C. WITH my 6'2", 220 lb. dad in the passenger seat and 130,000 miles already on the car, at an average speed of 95 mph with NO problems).

Since the car is a first-run model, it did suffer all of the 'Neon problems.'  At 98K, the head gasket blew, but the dealership stood by their extended warranty and fixed it free of charge (they even paid towing).  The drivers' side window is slightly off its track and that leaves scratches and an oily streak when the window is put up and down (especially in cold weather).  The drivers' side seat no longer reclines, but at least it is stuck in the position that I find most comfortable to drive in.  The passenger side window no longer sits flush against the car, so there is quite a bit of wind noise at freeway speeds for my passengers, and water comes in during heavy rain or an automated car wash.  The door on the passenger side is sagging as well, which causes it to stick slightly, but this is not a major problem.

The Neon has a ton of room in it for passengers or anything else you want to carry.  I already told you about my cross-country move; other things I have done include putting SIX people in it for an hour long drive (the backseat is huge) and getting some, well, you know, "action" in the backseat without injury to either partner.  :)

Gas mileage is a huge plus; I have driven almost 400 miles on one tank.  Also, this car requires very little in the way of regular maintenance.  I honestly abuse my little Neon, and it hasn't given me much grief.

The stereo system is VERY decent for a car of this price and year.  There are 6 speakers, and they have good output.  There is almost no distortion even at high volume.

The Neon handles extremely well and is frankly a joy to drive.  For its size, the car has good power and acceleration, even on hills.  The stick shift is fun to play around with, but as with any car, gets rough with age.

I have been in one small fender-bender with the Neon, with surprisingly little damage.  I was sideswiped by a Ford Mustang in the snow, with only a minor dent to show for it (of course, the Mustang didn't have a scratch on it).  Speaking of body damage, my other big complaint is that the drivers' side molding fell off when the glue melted one hot summer.  Luckily, I was parked at the time, so it's not like I lost the molding and had to buy a new one.

One last word of caution:  this car is TERRIBLE in rain.  It skids and hydroplanes like there was 4 feet of water on the ground even in heavy mist.  I loathe driving this car in a rainstorm (though it inexplicably handles well in snow).

Overall, I have been impressed with the quality of the Neon, and with the customer support behind it.  I am hoping when I finally purchase a higher-end luxury car (Probably a BMW or Audi) sometime next year, that the service people are at least as nice as those who care for my little Neon.  It was the perfect car for me at a time when I had very little cash but wanted an automobile that would be pleasant to drive (and not get me more than the usual amount of derision that an American economy car can invite).  That said, in this price range, a Saturn, which my mother drives, is actually a better buy and higher quality.  If you are considering a Neon, check out the Saturns first.
