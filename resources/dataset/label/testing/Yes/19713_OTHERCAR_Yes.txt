            My husband recently traded in my 1995 Saturn SL2 four door and bought me a SW wagon, in silver.  The car is gorgeous for a wagon.  It has all the room I could ever want with room to spare.  Although it is a wagon, it is sharp enough to be taken to the office where everyone is driving flashy, more expensive cars.  The mileage is fantastic! I just got almost 300 miles on one tank of gas.  The stereo is awesome and the security system a great plus.  The car is extremely quiet and gives a very smooth ride, shutting out noise from other vehicles. 
The only thing I am not crazy about is the very light colored seats.  They are a creamy tan and so light that I'm afraid to sit on them.  I would have liken the car to come with a more durable color.  Anyone needing a sharp, very reliable car with great mileage and plenty of room should definitly buy this vehicle!<br><br>
