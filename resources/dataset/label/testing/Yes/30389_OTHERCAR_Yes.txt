            I really like the 2001 Aztek.  We have had one since April 2001.  It's roomy, and a very nice riding vehicle.  However, the model we have is a GT AWD and it seems to have some problems with shifting panels in the front end.  The head lights are sticking out beyond the molding on the passenger side and the driver side is fine.  You can even see the clips where it's supposed to be connected.  We have checked out other models on the local car lot and they are all fine.  We have reported this to the Dealership but it's was blown off the first time and the second time they told us that they all have that problem and that they don't know if there is anything they can do about it.  (We are still waiting to hear back from them).  But they aren't AWD's, so we are figuring that this is a "quirk" with the GT AWD's.  Also the plastic fitting around the windshield shrank in the summer time.  It was replaced under warranty and now it seems that the replacement is to small and gaps about 1/2 and inch on either side.  Also the hatch hook sticks and you have to press the keyless entry several times before it unlocks.  The tent it awkward to put up and must be waterproofed.  We made the mistake of not waterproofing it and got soaked on out camping trip.  
   But on the other hand, I do love the Aztek.  I would love for this one to get fixed or replaced.  The stereo is good and the steering wheel controls are an asset.  We do a lot of camping and trips and it's got tuns of room for all our stuff.  Two thumbs up!  I just wish that Pontiac was better about fixing the front panel problems.  I spoke with a rep from the online connection for question and concerns about the vehicles and they said that that might be the reason that the plastic moldings are not on the 2002 models.
