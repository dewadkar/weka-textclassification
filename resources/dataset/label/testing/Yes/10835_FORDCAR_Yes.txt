            We have been hunting for a way to haul all the hiking and biking gear around, yet still have the ability to handle all those family members that love to visit,(we live in Alaska!)  I kind of thought a minivan was on the horizon, and wouldn't you know, there it was.  I had a great Olds 88 LS giving us 25 mpg and all the passenger room we needed, but no way to haul a thing.

I fell for the cool looks of the Windstar before I knew what a deal this thing could be.  

The only complaint I have is that we bought used and I am finding the annoying little things that are broken have turned out to be unbelievably expensive.  A turn signal up front with a crack, (that only I can see) is $121.  The last owner didn't like lights, so they removed the overhead bulbs, but broke the light bulb holders which meant replacing the whole inner canopy, $210.  A door latch on the center console broke, meaning you had to buy the whole door, $135.  A cup holder liner in center console, $25.  And the door step well light was gone, it was only $35.  Oh, and those creepy bolt cover hubcaps on ALLOY wheels, $69 each, thank God I only needed one and found an outside source for $35.

I guess the first thing that got me was the look of the van and then the smooth, car like ride.  I have had my share of SUV and truck products in my 30 years of driving, but was amazed how comfortable this van is.  It is every bit as comfortable as the Olds with even more legroom.  And, guys, that dash is a sweet number.  The front of the 1998 is very rugged and cute.  The previous years and subsequent years would not have caught my eye like this baby.

I do agree, being able to inter-change the bench in back with the single seats in the middle like Chrysler would be way cool, but we can't have it all.

The bottom line I can haul the mountain bikes without having to remove the front tires and re-true them at the site.  The seats will live in the garage until next summer for the vacationers.  Which gives us enough room to camp in the back!

I highly recommend this van.
