            After 25,000 miles, my Cougar has yet to spend a second in the shop for anything other than routine maintenance.  I got the 2.0l I4, and the gas mileage has remained in the mid-20s in the city, and upwards of 33mpg highway.  People still gape at this car from time to time, and friends beg to drive it.  Those who can drive a manual transmission (automatic only comes on the V6) are impressed by the smooth gearbox and tight handling.  The Cougar is quick and steady on takeoff, and for a 4-cylinder, surprisingly fast on the highway.  (Downside: speeding tickets!!!)  The only problems i've had have been minor electrical quirks, like the detachable stereo faceplate coming loose, and not being able to find the lock/unlock mechanism to install keyless entry.  Overall, though, a solid and beautiful car, and i regret that Ford has not advertised it better.  I would definitely recommend the Cougar to anyone who wants an economical, gorgeous car, and doesn't have time to spend at the repair shop.
