            I have used my G1 for 4 months and love it.  I did buy an addition long life battery and charger because I wanted the option of a seperate charging unit when I travel.  The charger I got can be used from a cigarette lighter plug in any car which came in usefull in Rome.  Lithium ION Battery Pack 
I was tired of charging the battery from the camera itself.  The lithium ION battery in my opinion is great and the option of using an IBM Microdrive for digital image storage is a plus. The unit comes with one rechargeable Lithium ION battery which is the same battery used in Canonï¿½s digital camcorders. This battery is supposed to be good for 500 pictures per charge which should for most eliminate any requirement for a backup battery pack but I didn't want to be cought without a back up. The Powershot G1 comes with a battery charger / AC adapter and is charged while in the camera. An orange light on the viewfinder indicates when the battery is finished charging. 
 The camera has performed great and I love how easy it is to work.  This is where I got my charger. The Battery Bank
