            This is a great digital camera.  It is simple to use, and takes great pictures indoors and out.  It includes a built in zoom lens (3x optical, 6x digital) and flash, and the price is reasonable by digital camera standards.  I picked one up for $699 when they first came out, and I have seen them discounted now for a very low $599 - an unbeatable combination of price and quality features.  Pictures are recorded onto floppy disks, and the camera includes a 4x quick access floppy disk drive.

Out of the box, the camera is ready to use, after you charge the included battery.  I also opted for the starter kit from Sony's web site.  This included a carrying case, three blank diskettes, and a high capacity battery that lasts a VERY long time. I would recommend this to anyone who buys the camera, it is a good combination of products for the price.

Another option I purchased is a nice case that holds 10 floppy disks.

The LCD is clear and easy to preview images through.  There are many different modes:
MPEG movie - for up to a minute of great sound and video;
Still with Sound - this is really neat if you ever try it.  
Still - takes great photos in a number of different resolutions;

The floppy format is convenient, reusable, inexpensive, and holds about 6 pictures per floppy (or up to 60 seconds of video).  Another benefit is that there are no cables to connect to your PC.

The audio out jack connects the camera to a TV or VCR for playback.  Your images/movies can be recorded to video tape.  The camera also includes a nice slideshow feature.  

The only minor (tiny tiny) quibbles I have are:
1) Some of the pictures I take (indoors, at night) have a lot of &quot;Red Eye&quot; effect, and I am not sure how to adjust the Auto exposure to remedy this.  There is no &quot;Red Eye&quot; mode like I have seen on some non-digital cameras.  However, you can remove &quot;Red Eye&quot; with a package like Adobe Photoshop.

2) There is no A/C adapter, the camera only runs off the rechargeable battery.  Make sure you have a freshly charged backup battery on hand.

If you're considering a digital camera, it's hard to go wrong with the Sony MVC-FD83.  Buy one and you'll be happy!!<br><br>
