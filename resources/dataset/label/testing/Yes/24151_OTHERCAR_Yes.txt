            The Ricoh RDC-5300 is one sleek camera.  I bought it as a gift for my other half, who has put off buying a camera until digital cameras had resolutions of better than 1.5 megapixels and were a bit less expensive.  I chose this product because it fit his requirements, and because of the discount I received as a Ricoh employee.  Even without the discount, I'd have likely purchased this camera - it's that nice.  It is loaded with features and has a very slim, elegant design.  It comes with 3x optical zoom augmented by 3x digital zoom so that you can get very close to the subject of your photo.  And the screen on the back of the camera acts as a viewpiece and as a place to scan through the photos you have already taken.  Extra memory cards are available and are a real necessity.  The remote control is a great plus.  We've used it to take photos of the family at Christmas.  A very nice piece of equipment.<br><br>
