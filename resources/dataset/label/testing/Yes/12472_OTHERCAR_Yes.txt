            The first car I bought that was brand new was a 1995 Dodge Neon.  The day after the last payment was made, the VERY NEXT DAY, the check engine light went on.  I went with my brother to check out this new smaller Volvo that I had seen advertised on television.  You know the ad where the guy drives his dogs around the block?  Well I felt a little embarrassed to even drive my Neon onto the Volvo lot but my desire to try out the S40 won out.  It was love at first drive!  The car fit me well and felt like a very solid piece of machinery.  Granted, this was not a hard feat given that I had spent 5 nail biting years driving a Neon.  I do a lot of driving for my job and my beleaguered mechanic insisted that I purchase a 6 cylinder engine.  I was a bit disappointed to learn that the S40 only came in a 4 cylinder.  That disappointment disappeared the moment I merged onto the highway.  The turbo tuned engine had me up to speed and safely on the highway in no time at all.  If I had to name one drawback, it would have to be the back seat.  It is definitely small and cramped.  As I never sit in the back seat, I don't care!

It is coming up on a year since I bought this car (September) and I am still just as crazy about it as the day I drove it off the lot.  Good looks, incredible safety and a terrifically fun ride!   <br><br>
