            For too many years I have been cruising the streets of Pennsylvania in a 1990 Mercury Sable Station Wagon.  A �Mommy-car� as some would call it.  Please don�t get me wrong,  I loved my �Sable-Wagon�.  But, over the last year, I have come to realize that we needed a �regular� vehicle, one that would be fun to drive, yet mature.  The station wagon was just too much car, for our now grown up family.  Adding to that fact was the reality that its advanced age was beginning to mean advanced big repair bills, we decided it was time to buy a new car.

The new car had to be special.  It needed to be strong, conservative, and safe.  It also needed to be a pleasant vehicle to drive.   Realizing that both of our teenagers will probably learn to drive in this car, it needed to be easy to handle, yet youthful.  And so�we started our search, right where our old search ended, at the Ford Lincoln Mercury dealership!

We purchased a <b>2000 Mercury Sable LS Premium.</b>  It is everything we needed in a vehicle, and everything we could want in a car.  Since primarily, this would be the vehicle I would drive, my husband supported and encouraged me to be �happy�.  I am a 40-something working mother of 2, and have always been practical when deciding on a car.  This one would have to be a little bit more.

<b>FEATURES OF THE 2000 MERCURY SABLE LS PREMIUM</b>

Our new car came standard with an automatic transmission, leather bucket seats and a moon roof.  It has an AM/FM stereo sound system with a cassette player. We opted not to spend the extra money for a CD Player.  It has climate control�we simply set the temperature and the car judges what is needed�A/C or heat.  The automatic climate control can be disabled, and controlled manually if desired.   The control panel displays the inside temperature and has a button to display the outside temperature as well.    

 The windows, moon roof, and seat adjustments operate electrically.   The pedals can be adjusted to fit the driver, as can the driver seat.  All 4 doors will automatically lock as the car begins to move and will only unlock when the door is opened from the inside, or the locks are manually unlocked.

There is a traditional compartment box in the front panel, in front of the passenger seat.  There is a storage box between the bucket seats, and the back of each front seat has a pouch for paper storage.  The A/C--Heating vents are adjustable, and are located in the front seats as well as the back seats.  The back seats cool and heat at the same rate as the front.  There is a storage tray near the gearshift, that also has cup holders.  There are cup holders in the back seats as well.

The <b> Mercury Sable 2000 LS Premium</b> was truly designed with consideration to females.  There are two vanity mirrors, one in the drivers visor as well as the passenger visor.  Both are lighted, and have dimmer adjusters. 

It has 3.0 liter, V-6, 24-valve fuel injected aluminum engine.  It also has anti-lock brakes and traction control.  As of yet, this safety feature has not come into play, but I am sure that as the winter months set in, I will appreciate the braking features.   Performance so far is excellent, the car has some real power, and �get up and go�.  (I really do not have a strong base of comparison since my previous vehicle was a 1990 Sable Wagon that had a different engine and weight)  The car uses regular gas, and is supposed to get about 20 MPG city driving, 26 MPG on the highway.  Maintenance is standard�the dealer gave us a schedule of recommended maintenance visits.

My new <b> 2000 Mercury Sable LS Premium </b> has a built in security system.  It came standard, as many new cars do today with a �clicker�.  Now from this clicker, I can lock, or unlock my doors.  I can open the trunk, or I can �Panic�.  When I press the �Panic� button, the car�s alarm sounds.  A great feature for finding the car in a crowded parking lot!!  There is also a trunk release inside the car, as well as a hood release.  Both are conveniently located on the left side of the drivers seat.  Inside the trunk, there is also an additional release handle.  The car was designed with many safety features!

I especially like the lights, both inside and out.  The outside headlights that so traditionally were �Mercury� have changed.  They no longer wrap around the front of the car, but are just simple lights.  The car has a day-light feature as well as driving lights, parking lights, and fog lights. The day lights are not as bright as the regular driving lights.  I have not used this feature yet, since in Pennsylvania it is not the law to keep lights on when driving during the day.  The inside panel lights brighten the inside of the car.  They are easy to see and reach from both the driver and passenger sides.

The seats are leather.  The driver�s seat is electrically adjustable, but the passenger seat adjustment is manual.  Both seats recline fully backwards.  The back seat has a 60/40 split, so that if needed an item longer than the trunk allowance can be transported.  There is also an armrest in the back seat.

My <b> 2000 Mercury Sable LS Premium</b> is officially �Medium Royal Metallic Blue� with a medium graphite interior.  That translates to a Midnight Blue, with a bluish-gray interior.  Pretty snazzy for a 40-something working mom!!    Perhaps it is as my friends are claiming, time for my �mid-life crisis�!!
