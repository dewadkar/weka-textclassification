            In short, I love this camera!!!!  It is the absolute best item in our house.  With a new baby and family that lives in another state, a digital camera was an absolute must.  And one that is easy to use, has good quality pictures and doesn't cost a fortune in batteries was on my list.  This has it's own rechargeable battery.  We had a camera that used regular batteries first.  We could only take about three pictures before it was completely drained.  The Sony has an infolithium battery that can be switched between the Sony camcorder as well.  The viewfinder on the back of the camera makes it easy to get baby to smile while you get the picture.  The pictures are stored on a regular disk and this makes putting the pictures on the computer a snap.  You can carry around disks and aren't limited on a trip by the memory of the camera.
The feature that allows you to make short movies is well worth the extra price.  I got my baby's first laugh on a movie.  It was a priceless moment.  The format of jpg used is also a bonus.  It is easily read by any computer.

I highly recommend this camera.  <br><br>
