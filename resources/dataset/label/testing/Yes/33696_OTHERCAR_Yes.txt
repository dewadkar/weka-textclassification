            I bought a used Lexus LS400, and I am completely satisfied with this vehicle.  When I bought it, it had 100,000 mi on it, now in just 3 yrs, it has 170,000.  I have only invested $600 in maintenance, including oil changes and new tires.  It is a wonderful car.  All the luxuries that a person could ask for, a smooth ride, great pick up when necessary, large trunk for carrying all the extra items; and it is exceptionally dependable.  I only paid $15,000 for it, and everyone is surprised when they find that out.  There is a myth that luxury cars are out of reach for the average person, and that is simply not true.  I am very satisfied and even my mechanic misses me.<br><br>
