            I got my camera about 6 mos. ago and have been very pleased with it.I drive long haul semi and with the cameras I used before I didn't know if the picture I took was a good one or a bad one till I had the film developed.with this camera I know right them what I've got.I've taken pictures out the side window at 60 mph and they come out as if I'm standing still.with the view of the picture screen I can see the picture before I take it,yet afterwards if I don't like it I have the choice to keep it or delete it to make more room for other pictures.It's a very simple camera to operate,and It's nice to come home and print the picture when I want and not have to wait for them to be developed.Yet you can take them and have them done but I print a sample out on my EPSON 440 printer and when I have what I want the I have a Hewlett Packard 6460 photo printer that i print my final pictuers out on.I have a review on that also. This camera works well when used with the 6460,but there are other program I mix with them.Over all this camera is a very good one to me and to prove it we've bought 2 more for christmas for family members.<br><br>
