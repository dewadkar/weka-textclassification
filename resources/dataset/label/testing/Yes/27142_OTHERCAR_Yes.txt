            I am the proud owner of a Black 1998 Avenger ES. This car gives BMW and Lexus owners the double-look syndrome. It the perfect marriage of style, comfort and convenience. The sound system (even the basic one) is outstanding, I suggest going with the Premium or the Infinity option is possible, you won't regret it. Altough the I-4 might lack a bit of &quot;humph&quot;, it makes it up very nicely by the pure joy and excitement of the comfortable ride the car gives.  The vehicle might seem a bit pricey at first, but take it for a spin, get the feel of the road, and trust me, you'll never want anything else. I've clocked over 60000 miles in the first year on mine, and I haven't had ANY mechanical issue whatsoever, it's very reliable. And with options like the home-link transmitter, available 17&quot; aluminum rims and Infinity sound-system, it's sure to make you a happy driver.<br><br>
