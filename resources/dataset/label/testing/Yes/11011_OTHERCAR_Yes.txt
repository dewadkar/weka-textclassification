            The price and the room on Astro van is a big factor when purchasing a new van. We have owned  3 vans in the past and the price of the Astro and the room in it made us decide on it. We have owned two Aerostars and on Windstar, by far this has more room than any of them.We have 4 children, with 3 of them being 6 foot or over teenage boys and one girl. WE recently took a trip to San Francisco with all of them and our golden retriever and we all fit with some room to spare.  We have a 2000 and it has optional captains chair in the second row and this made for some nice traveling for the ones that sat in them.  My oldest complained of the third seat seat saying that it swayed back there. Everyone has to remember that this is on truck frame and it will not ride like a car. The only complaint on it is on the passenger side foot area. It is a little narrow but it isn't that bad. I Love driving around town and when we do take longer trips it is nice to have a little extra room. The other option that I highly recommend is the dutch doors with the glass that lifts up. This makes getting things easier and when buying $300 worth of groceries you have the chance to make sure nothing is going to fall out before opening the doors. My kids think the Astro is unattractive but it has come along way since it first came out. Having teenagers, they tend not to think that a family car is a good idea they only think of the sports cars and how fast they can go.Just wait till they have children of there own and then the tune will change. IF you want room, good price and some hauling capabilities then this is the van for you.<br><br>
