            If you are looking for a reliable car with a gem of an engine and good gas mileage then you are right on, the 1994 NISSAN SENTRA. I bought this car in 1997 from a friend who wanted to upgrade to a Camry. It had 56000 miles on it and I paid $ 6000 w/tax and title. I knew him pretty well from the time he bought the car new and AFAIK the only part replaced was the starter motor. It now has 86,000 miles on it and in the 3 yrs I owned I spent less than $ 200 aside from regular oil changes and a set of tires and alignment. The front rotors were squealing and so I got the rotors smoothened for $ 56. Even now sometimes it squeals when it rains but that's OK with me. All my friends who own Nissans complain about this bad brake design. The other time at a friends house I hit a concrete embankment while backing the car and the washer that connects the muffler gave away and the car started making a sound similar to that heard when the muffler has holes. The mechanic charged me 40 bucks to fix that and thats it. Other than that I do not have any problems with the car. I even take the car on a 450 mile trip every now and then with confidence knowing that it would not die on me and not once did it fail me. Overall I am more than pleased by this car's reliability. Kudos to Nissan for designing the powerplant. People pay lot of money on a Honda or a Toyota but Nissan gives you at least the same quality or even more. I know I can keep on exercising that odometer and my car would run forever.

    That said I will tell you how I feel about the interior. The cup holders are a joke. They are too tiny to fit anything larger than a small cup and many a time, I spill coke in the cabin because I keep it on the floor and trying to hold with a leg and they invariably fall down, staining the carpet. Nissan are you listening to me? Aren't your engineers competent enough to design a decent cupholder? Also, why does this car have four doors. If you are any taller than 5'5&quot; then you would have a hard time getting into the car from the back doors. Also, your knees wouldn't have any space. I would not advise the back seat to adults, only kids. The AC is not bad or nothing to brag about either. 
The build is good without that odd rattle and squeak but the trunk sounds very tinny when closed. Hey why am I complaining? It's an economy car and they are supposed to be like that. I am very impressed with the list of standard features on this car, tilt wheel, cruise control and intermittent wipers.

If you want a no frills car to take you from one point to the other with good value for money then you would do good in this 1994 Sentra. If you
give more importance to creature comforts better shop elsewhere. Don't get me wrong. This epinion is for 94 Sentra XE only. I completely changed my opinion about this economy car when I experienced the &quot;Uncompact Sedan&quot;, the 2000 Sentra SE. 145 hp, 16&quot; alloy wheels, sun roof, spoiler, performance package for less than 16,000 bucks, unbelievable right? Check it out. My wife owns the SE and that's a different review. I always find excuses to swap our cars to drive her 2000.<br><br>
