             I purchased by 03' Mazda Tribute LX-V6 7 months ago.  It replaced a 1993 Ford Explorer Sport (2 Door).  I included this information so that you have a frame of reference as to some of my remarks. 
 First of all to those who think that the Tribute is simply a rebadged Ford Escape, this is not totally true.  The body and some interior pieces are common to both cars, but the Tribute is powered by a Mazda engine and drive train. The suspension is a beefed up Miata suspension.   There is a big difference in the way both cars drive.  Let's start with the appearance. 

The Mazda Tribute is a more polished vehicle than the Ford Escape.  Where the Escape has lots of flat finish vinyl on the Tribute it is painted.  There is actually chrome on the Tribute. The interior fabrics on the seats on the Tribute are more upscale than they are on the Escape.  However, the interior trim (dashboard cover and interior door surrounds) are covered with this very thin, cheap vinyl fabric.  The armrests on the doors are just plain metal with this unpadded vinyl material covering them.  This can hurt your elbow on long trips.  This material also cuts and scratches very easily. One of my dogs (Golden Retreiver) just put her front paws on the dash and this action put deep scratches in the material (and her nails are short). Plain and simple I am amazed that both Ford and Mazda use this same material in both the Tribute and the Escape.  If you have kids, this will be a concern as I feel that you would have lots of damage to this trim in a short period of time.
I used my Explorer for 10 years to cart dogs around in and when I sold it, the interior still looked very good.  I can not say the same will be true for the Tribute.  

<b>Driveability</b>

  The Tribute is a little pocket rocket!  My Tribute has the 205HP V-6 engine with automatic transmission.  When I test drove it, I was amazed at the power it has.  Since I have had it I have only had to use full power once or twice.  The freeway entrance near my house is one of those that is on an incline going upwards and very short. At half power if I don't watch it, I can be doing 80 at the top!  Even with all this power I get about 21.5 mpg.  The handling is top notch. With my Explorer, I felt like I was driving a 10 foot tall ladder on roller skates on the freeway. It would roll and buck and wobble, especially in turns. I even had the suspension beefed up. 
This helped a little, but I still felt the Explorer inherently unstable.  When I test drove the Tribute the salesperson took me down to a road that had lots of twists and turns. I was amazed at its stability.  Just crank in the amount of turn you want and the Tribute behaves without any lean or feeling of excessive roll. It is a very well mannered vehicle.  The standard tires are Continentals.  These are very quiet, well handling tires.  I usually use Michelin on my vehicles and these Continentals are very comparable in handling. Wet road handling is exceptional. Braking efficiency is normal.  It will stop the Tribute quickly within a reasonable amount of time and distance. 
In both city and highway driving the interior is quiet. There is no wind howl.  My Tribute has the optional sun roof and the metal wind guard does rattle with the sun roof 1/2 way open while on the freeway.  If you open the sunroof fully this doesn't happen. When closed the sun roof is quiet and doesn't leak.  

<b>Utility</b> 

I find that the Tribute has about 80% of the storage space I had in my Explorer.  The only thing I don't care for is that if you want the rear seats down you must remove the rear seat headrests.  Then you have to store those somewhere.  Since I don't carry rear seat passengers very often I just leave them in the house. 
The air conditioning system is the coldest I have ever had in a vehicle.  Even after sitting out in the sun all day all you have to do is roll the windows down to let the heat escape for a block or two then roll the windows back up.  The Tribute will be ice cold in just a few more blocks.  In the Texas heat, this is a major plus.  Another word about the air conditioning system, the airflow is somewhat limited as to where you can direct the air.  On my Explorer you could send airflow to any of the openings (Dash, Floor, Windshield or any combination thereof)for both air conditioning and heating. This is not true for the Tribute.  For air conditioning, you only have the dash air vents.  You can send the air to the other vents while using outside fresh air or heat only, but not with the A/C. The A/C does engage when defrost is selected for faster windshield defogging/defrosting. My Tribute has the optional pollen filter installed.  This is a replaceable filter that goes in the air conditioning system to filter out dust and pollen.  It works wonderfully.  I never have any dust build up in the vehicle (especially on the dashboard) and I drive through several road construction sites daily.  This was a $29.00 option and I highly recommend it. It can be dealer installed. I believe it is an annual replacement item.  The dealer just checked it at the 7,500 mile checkup and said it didn't need replacing yet. 
  The audio system is an AM/FM CD and Cassette unit.  The sound is great.  I am one of those who usually has the factory unit ripped out an an Alpine system installed.  I did not have to do this with the Tribute.  I am totally satisfied with the sound system that was supplied with the Tribute. 

<b>Dealer Support</b> 

 I have only had my Tribute in the dealer twice.  Once for an oil change (which was free) and for the 7,500 mile checkup. The reliability of my Tribute has been outstanding.
The dealer offers great service with the car ready at the times promised.  The dealer also has a program that offers free tire replacement when needed if you have your Tribute serviced by them.  They give you a schedule of maintenance and and how much each item on the schedule will cost. If you follow this, they will replace your tires with the same brand and type when needed.  I think this is a great deal.
The dealer service prices seem consistent with third party repair facilities. 
  I paid $20,000 for this Tribute and the best price I could have gotten on a Ford Escape was $23,000.  I feel the Tribute is a greater value.

<b>Summary</b> 

  Except for the cheap interior trim the Tribute is a great SUV with lots of room and great handling.  If you can live with the interior trim, I highly recommend it.  Hopefully, Ford and Mazda will address this issue in the future.
