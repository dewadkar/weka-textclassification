            We bought our CL18 last week and it has turned out to be a very good buy.  As with all things in life you only get what you pay for but with this camera we got more.  

The picture quality on high resolution is good as long as you get the lighting right (the flash isn't great).  It can hold 16 high res pictures and can be viewed through the TV as well as computer.  Its webcam is a nice extra, not a great quality but enough to put a smile on grandparents faces 6000 miles away.  

We haven't tried to get prints from it yet - I'm not expecting them to be 35mm quality, but it is fine for emailing, for putting on the internet and storing on the computer.  It's compact in size and runs on AA batteries so is cost effective to run, plus takes its power from the USB when connected.  It comes with a good Corel software package and is compatible with other software we already had, always a bonus for cheap cameras.  

In conclusion not a replacement for your trusted 35mm but a nice toy for a great price.<br><br>
