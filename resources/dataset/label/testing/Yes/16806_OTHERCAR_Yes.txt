            Since 1969, the Chevrolet Camaro has been known for two things: Sex Appeal and ability to smoke Mustangs off the start.  Now a days, the Camaro SS is known for being only a fraction of a second slower than a Corvette.  My heart nearly exploded when my friend took me around the block in his 1999 Camaro SS.  Not only does it have the Muscular Open Air Intake, Hood Scoop, Cat Back Exhaust, Rally Wheels, Street/Strip Tires, Performance Suspension, and a 330 hp motor (some say 350 hp), but it has the ability to do 1/4 mile in under 13 seconds...that's if you go easy on the clutch.

I fell in love with the Chevy Small Block back in 1994.  I saw a 1970 Camaro RS with a Chevy Small Block 350 smoke a Mustang GT 351 by 2 car lengths in a quarter mile race.  Of course, the power hungry people of the US declare the Chevelle 454 SS to be the fastest car to go straight, but the Camaro has surprising handling on turns for the speed, Horsepower, and torque it provides.  I am biased by the sensitive throttle, and I am sturdy in my stand for Chevrolet.  When a Ford Mustang whatever cobra or GT comes up to the Starting Line Up (stop light), I have never seen a more embarrassed show-off when the Camaro lights it's tires and screams to victory.  

The Firebird--Trans Am is a nice car also, but the Camaro gives out a sense of FEAR as it Roars through the intersection.  Truly, this car is the Heartbeat of Chevrolet.
