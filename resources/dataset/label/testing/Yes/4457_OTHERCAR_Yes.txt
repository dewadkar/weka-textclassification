            most people in the world go for the &quot;mainstream&quot; car.  this car is not one of them.  these little babys may seem alittle high in price, but they keep high resale value.  they also have something for for your butt, HEATED SEATS.  the leather is nice inside and the speaker system is a gotta have.  nice bass and it comes with a 6 CD Changer... how can you not love that.  it has an insurance back seat, which means lower insurance.  it is pretty much a 2 person car, unless you have friends that have no legs.  its an overall Great Car.<br><br>
