            We have a 1999 GXE Special Edition and have been very happy with it. This was my wife's first car, and she picked out a winner!

The engine is suprisingly quick, and getting on the freeway is no problem. The automatic transmission works well, when you really gas it, it shifts at around 4000rpm's, giving you good power. Going up steep hills is where you wish you had a bit more, but this is a small issue for me. Most of my driving is on relatively flat areas. One other thing, the engine loses a lot of punch if you are running the A/C. I turn off the A/C if I am getting on a freeway, or need the acceleration at full. Cruise control works fine; no problems at all.

The interior is designed cleanly, with only a few quirks. In fact, the only one I have found is the cup holders are in a bad position. If you pull out the cup holder, then put a cup in it, the cup blocks the radio. If you put a cup in the right hand cupholder, the cup will actually push down one of the buttons, and you will be unable to use the other buttons to skip cd tracks...The A/C is nice and you get cool air almost immediately after turning on the engine. We have had our car for two hot Texas summers, and the A/C is still going strong.

The trunk room is large for a compact car. You can flip down the seats and have even more cargo area. I can fit my mountain bike in the back this way (tight, but it fits!). The back seats are comfortable, not too much room, but as to be expected in a smaller car.

Other great things about the car: Keyless entry, nice CD player/speakers, don't have to pay too much at the pump, easy to maneuver in parking lots.

If I were to get another car, I would put the Sentra at the top of my list. I would probably look at the SE model, with its more powerful engine, as well.<br><br>
