            Until I bought and drove my Allante, I hated driving. Driving this car has however changed that.  It's fun, fast, and comfortable. I get stopped by people all the time complimenting it.  It is however expensive to repair. Parts for it are sometimes hard to get, and cost more than the average car. It is worth it though. I will never get rid of this car. I need some body and interior work done on it now, but I'd rather fix this one up then buy any other new car. If you want a great car, this is the one. They are however, hard to find, most owners don't readily sell them. thanks for reading.  Marc<br><br>
