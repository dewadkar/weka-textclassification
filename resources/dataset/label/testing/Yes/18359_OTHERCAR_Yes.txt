            Have owned our Mercury Villager minivan for almost nine months now. It has been a great car (based on the Nissan Quest). We own the sport version (larger wheels). It drives like a car, is very comfortable and has excellent visibility. We have the version with the rear hatch with the rear window that opens independently. This is very useful for trips and quick storage. The only two problems encountered so far: one front window molding that needed re-gluing and a stuck rear seat (it would not roll forward all the way). Both problems we quickly and easily resolved at the dealership. The minivan gets good mileage, has nice power for going up hills and the air conditioning/heat works quite well. While it is a bit expensive when compared to the Windstar, we are quite happy with our decision to buy the Villager.
