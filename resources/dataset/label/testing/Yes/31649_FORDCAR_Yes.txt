            The History
I hate anything to do with cars except for driving them. This is a relatively new position for me. Until about 4 years ago, I performed all of my own preventative maintenance and most mechanical repair work. I would  have rather watched Rosie (guns are evil and nobody should ever own one, except my body guard. Yeah that Rosie) than let someone else change my oil or spark plugs. However, with age and newer cars comes wisdom. I know longer had the time and patience to delve into the mysteries of auto mechanics. 

The Problem
Where would I find someone that I could trust my vehicles to? While word of mouth seemed like a good referral service, it proved to be anything but. This person said that ABC Auto (1) did wonderful work, while Jane said that she had nothing but problems from them but Acme did outstanding work. Of course Bob said that Acme treated him terribly but Topcat was the best auto repair place in the world. And so the circle went. Being the analytical thinker that I am, I soon came up with other options. I checked the yellow pages. It seems the only profession to rival attorneys when it comes to yellow page advertisements is that of auto mechanics. Back to the drawing board. I remembered that a friend of mine was at that time the manager of a local Schuck�s Auto Parts store. I explained my dilemma to him and was rewarded with a quick, if confusing answer. �Did I care if the mechanic had a shop?� Seems there was this guy who worked out of a van��

The Solution
Being out of viable options, and hearing rave reviews from my buddy, I decided to give this guy a shot. The only way to contact him was through a pager whose number was on the wall at Schuck�s. As I can�t seem to remember to write it down, calling Schuck�s is still the only way I can contact him. The business name is Mechanic On Duty. And that pretty much covers it. I needed a new oil pump on my 8 year old Ford pickup the first time I called him. He showed up the next day, at exactly the time that he said he would. You�ll notice that I said �he showed up�. He will come to wherever you want your vehicle worked on. The Mechanic On Duty is a one-man-shop if you will. He showed up in his van with what I thought must have been all of his tools. I found out later that he actually has two vans and the type of job dictates which van-load of tools he brings. His name is John. I have never heard his last name and probably never will. Unlike most mechanics, John doesn�t seem to mine if you watch him work. For the first time, I wanted to see just how he performed his job. I found him to be very personable and just an all around nice guy. He found the problem, went on a parts run (a 20 mile round trip from my place), returned within the hour and finished the job. The estimate that I received from another auto shop: $425.00. My bill from from the Mechanic On Duty- $215.00. I have used him for other problems and have yet to be disappointed. I have also recommended him to friends and have not heard a complaint yet. He once came to my place of work and had my vehicle fixed before I needed it to go home. Service like this is hard to find anywhere these days. Finding it delivered to you door is a miracle. 

Side Topic
This review had to be posted under the vehicle are due to a completely heartless lack of consideration. Nowhere in epinions is a listing for the thriving metropolis of Bucoda. Bucoda is a drug ridden little berg of about 200 souls who are either unemployed or wish they were. They do however have the Mechanic on Duty and one of the best tavern hamburgers known to man. 

(1) All business names mentioned are fictitious except for the Mechanic on Duty.
