                 My son convinced me to purchase this camera in case we were to sell some items on E-bay so $460 later I am the proud owner of the Sony Digital Mavica. My son showed me how to use it and now I don't leave home without it. I've never liked cameras before because I like instant pictures and I get them with the Sony.

     Today I took a picture of the leaves turning fall colors today because I took my Sony Digital Camera. I love it! How easy is it to use?
I'm 50 years old and I learned (I'm Polish too!). 

This is how easy it is to use.
1. Insert the floppy.
2. Turn it on.
3. Remove the lens cover.
4. Aim and take the picture.

How do I review the picture?
1. Turn switch from camera to play, push display and there's the picture.

     It's that easy. I can erase the pictures I don't like or want in a few seconds. Now I can down load the pictures to my computer, send them to friends, put them on E-bay, put them on letters and envelopes and other things too numerous to name. 

     I put my picture on the return portion of an envelope I send to my friends with Sony's help. This camera is a blast. No need to develop film. No waiting for pictures and purchasing pictures you don't want. If you have a special program on you computer you can change the color of the pictures or change/add features. 

     For quality pictures at home make sure you use special photo paper. If you use regular printing paper the picture won't be as detailed or nice. 

     Rent or borrow one from a friend and experience the satisfaction of taking pictures you want when you want. I'm thinking of purchasing a camera to keep in my car at all times and one for the house because on occasion I have forgotten it at home and regretted not taking it with me.
