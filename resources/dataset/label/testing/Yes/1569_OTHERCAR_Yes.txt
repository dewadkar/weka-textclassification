            Over the objections of everyone in the family I bought a new 1995 Dodge Grand Caravan SE 5 years and 100,000 miles ago.  I figured it would be good for my business even though all I needed was transportation not hauling.  What I figured was that it would be great for the anticipated grand-kids.  There was only one at the time but today there are four and one more coming.

Needless to say, it became the focal point for joint transportation.  Nobody liked it but they flocked to it for long rides.  It seats seven comfortably and rides like a passenger car not a truck.  Most reviews at the time gave it a decent review but was concerned about frequency of repair.  I have had no unusual problems.  My only regret is that I bought mine the year before dual sliding doors.  This feature has to be the biggest auto improvement since power steering.

My advice to any family with small children or a family with 3 or more kids is forget the gas guzzling SUV and get a Caravan.<br><br>
