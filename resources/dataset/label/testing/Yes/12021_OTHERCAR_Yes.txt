            This car is THE best sports car under $40,000. Sure it doesn't have a lot of torque, but it makes up for the tach fast once it hits 6000 rpm.

What I love about this car.

1. Stick shift. 
I always thought that Miata had the best stick shift, but S2000's is even better. Its precise linkage, short throw makes it by far the best shifter I've ever driven.
2. The engine.
The engine truly comes alive when it goes above 6000rpm. You have to watch carefully to notice it for the first couple of times, but it's definately there. When you downshift from 6th to 4th gear and give some gas on a freeway, you'll feel the thrust.

What I hate about this car. 

1. The radio. 
Urg. What's up with the radio cover??? The buttons on left side of the steering wheel should allow me to turn the radio on and off. It doesn't. It just lets me change stations or skip tracks. 
2. Plastic rear window.
It isn't that bad, but for a 30 grand car, it should have a glass window.
3. Exhaust note.
I wish it had the exhaust sound more like a Porche's. It's too thrashy. It doesn't have that Porche's mechanical sound.

Overall, killer engine, precise shifter, nice handling definately makes this car a sports car for people with brain. :)
