            Three years ago I leased my first Honda Accord. 
I finally gave into the fact that I no longer could tool around in two door cars, anyone who has tried this with an Infant knows exactly what I mean. Friends and coworkers had been telling me about the merits of Hondas for quite some time and I decided to try it. I was happy with my fist Honda, so when my lease was up I decided that I was going to stay with Honda and the Accord in particular.

I have been driving my Honda Accord V6 for a few months now and I have to say, once again I am impressed with what Honda has done with the Accord.

When I looked at the 2000 Accord my first impression was
 just how solid the car looks from all angles. My only complaint was that the rear end of the car is a bit boxy.    
That impression was further solidified when I first drove the car; you get the feeling that you are sitting in a substantial automobile.

I decided pretty quickly that I would lease this vehicle, mostly because of my good experience with my first Honda.
A few months down the line I remain impressed with this vehicle. The standard VTEC engine is silky smooth and very responsive, acceleration and highway merging are no problem, this car has enough power to get you in and out of trouble!!!. 
Steering is, �drive with one hand� responsive and the car decently handles corners at speeds your not really supposed to corner at!!!.
I�m sure this has to do with the car suspension, I�m no expert but the car rides smooth, hard or bumpy roads do not present a problem. Double wishbone suspension is the technical term. For me that translates, to �Hey I�m doing 85 and it does not feel like it.
With the windows up, interior car noise is not an issue compared to my old 4cyl Accord.
I think the larger wheels and wider wheelbase on the 2000 has something to do with this as well.
I choose the leather interior, which really gives the car a luxury feeling, a moon-roof, which I love to use, fully powered drivers seat, which is highly recommended.
Car came equipped with a CD player, the sound system is not that great, but you can change CD tracks and radio stations from a control on the steering wheel, this is a great deal in my eyes. All controls are within easy reach from the driver�s position.

From a safety perspective, the car came equipped with driver and passenger side airbags; in addition it comes with side impact air bags. Again, when you drive this car, you get a sense of substance and safety.

Fuel consumption is okay; I�ll pay for that for having the extra power at my disposal. 

This is a good car, is it a Ferrari, a Mercedes, a Porsche, of course not, but as a middle class family guy, It�s a car that serves my family well and still gives me some driving pleasure. I would make the same choice again.
