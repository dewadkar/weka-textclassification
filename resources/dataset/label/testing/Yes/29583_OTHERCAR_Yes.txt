            With everyone running around looking for a big van, there is still a group that wants a smaller van and not a station wagon.  The Quest satisfied that requirement for us.  

We recently retired our 1994 Villager GS van and replaced it with a 2000 Quest SE.  The Villager and the Quest are sisters, built in the same factory.  The SE handles great and has some great standard features like second row captains chairs and a built in VCR/6&quot; screen.  Between the captain's chairs and the TV you can actually go for long trips without the fights.  The radio even lets the kids listen to one source of music while the adults listen to something else.

The 2000 Quest has double sliding doors and more trunk space than the 1994 Villager.  However, it probably is not big enough for those that pack heavy or travel a lot with more than two children.  

The Quest really handles nicely, only time will tell if it is as reliable as the Villager it replaces.  After only 1000 miles the vehicle has averaged ~21 mpg with mostly highway driving.
