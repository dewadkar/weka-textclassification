            A 1993 Chrysler Concorde, what else is there to say? One day I went out looking to buy a car. The first dealership I went to had this beautiful, emerald green 1993 Chrysler Concorde that hadn't been sitting in the lot for more than 10 minutes. This car is in perfect condition. An older couple had owned it before and didn't do a lot of driving. There was only 60,000 miles on it. Right away I knew that this car was perfect for me. 
I went out looking for a car that was roomy enough for five people to sit comfortably in, but also look sophisticated. The Chrysler Concorde fits that description perfectly.  
This car contains many perks that anyone can appreciate. It has power locks, power windows, and power seats. It also lets you control the temp inside the car. Say you want it to be an even 72 degrees F inside your car, just switch the knob to 72 and you are sitting comfortably. This particular Concorde came with a pioneer cd player, which worked very well. My favorite feature of this car is the huge trunk space. You can fit at least five dead bodies and a shovel back there. Ooops, bad joke.
I have had this car for a little bit under a year now, and I have had no problems with it. It accelerates very smoothly, and is really quite an enjoyable car to ride in. This is the first car that I have ever owned, and I am very happy with it. I'm a teenager in high school, and all of my friends love it, so you know it's not an old man car. If you want a whole lot of room (especially in the back seat, if you know what I'm saying) but still want to look sophisticated, I would seriously consider getting yourself a 93 Chrysler Concorde. What a ride!   <br><br>
