            RESPONSIVE!  That's the one word that comes most clearly to mind when I think about the Mitsubishi Galant ES (V-6).  

The slightest touch on the accelerator results in immediate and effortless acceleration.  Moreover, this torque reaches throughout the power band so the car accelerates well from virtually any speed.

Moreover, the handling is fantastic for its class of car.  I have never driven a 4-door sedan with such tight steering and road-hugging capabilities before.  This car is unbelievably fun to drive.

Also, the standard equipment package is great!  Standard includes automatic transmission, airbags, ABS, CD-player, remote keyless entry, anti-theft device, etc.  No extra cost!  Plus, the controls are very intuitive and well laid out.  

Overall, I am very, very impressed with the job Mitsubishi did with its 2001 Galant ES (V-6).<br><br>
