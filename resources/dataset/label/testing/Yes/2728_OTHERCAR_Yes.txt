               I purchased this vehicle for my wife and, at the time, 2 children (now 3)in 1997. I was 26 years old and had only owned foreign cars. I have to say this is the greatest vehicle on the road for traveling, shopping, or just pooling kids around.  The gas tank is large, and the ride is smooth and seemingly effortless, as well as very safe.  On the other hand, I have replaced the front brakes twice, replaced a set of tires, replaced 2 batteries, an alternator and the fuel pump, not to mention an electric window motor, the drivers seat bracket and all before 34,000 miles.
   With that being said, I am in the market again to replace this suburban and have shopped both the Excursion and Suburbans.  My wife does not like the &quot;trucky&quot; ride of the Ford Excursion, so I am waiting for the 2000 Subs to arrive at the dealer.  They have added side impact airbags for even more safety this year and run larger 4 wheel disc brakes to prevent the rapid wear.  
   I would suggest that anyone who enjoys a comfortable, safe and convenient ride purchase this product.  We had a few setbacks, but the roadside assistance was always super helpful whether the vehicle was actually roadside or parked in my driveway.  I could not get my wife in any other vehicle.  When she shops with her friends or family, our Suburban is always first choice.<br><br>
