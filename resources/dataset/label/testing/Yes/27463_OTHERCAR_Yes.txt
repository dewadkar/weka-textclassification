            I just bought a very cheap new car a few weeks ago, and this was my second choice.  While I didn't buy the Accent, I did rent it for a week to see if I could live with it as my car (plus I'd sold my problem-laden Galant and needed something to drive while I shopped).

My rental Accent was the GL hatchback with automatic transmission and air conditioning air conditioning, but nothing else.  It had a cassette deck, which meant that had I bought one, I'd have to upgrade the stock stereo, which while it sounded good-enough, I simply don't have tapes anymore.  There is a CD option, but it only comes with power windows and locks, which in my opinion don't belong on a simple little hatchback like this one.

The car has a 1.6 liter engine that while not particularly powerful, doesn't have very much weight to move around.  The result is that even with the automatic transmission, the car accellerates well and has plenty of passing power, though it won't win any drag races.  The car also gets very good mileage, rated at 25/35 by the EPA, my automatic tester gave me 33MPG in mixed driving, with a highway tank (75MPH, AC off) netting 41MPG.

Another area of this car that I feel qualified to review despite not owning one is highway cruising.  I am in the Army Reserve and my unit is 350 miles away from my house.  When I rented this car with "unlimited mileage", I really got my money's worth in that 850 miles weekend (I drove around a bit up in San Jose).

Driving up I-5 at 75MPH the Accent was actually pretty comfortable.  The driver's seat has adjustment for height at both the front and rear of the bottom cushion, which is MUCH better than the single adjustment on my old Galant, plus adjustable lumbar support.  For an economy car, this is an excellent seat, with firm, supportive cushions and a shape that doesn't lose its comfort after six hours.  In fact, my drive up was non-stop, and I rather enjoyed it.  I borrowed a cassette adapter and plugged my Minidisc player into the stereo and really enjoyed the ride.

The ride in the Accent is perhaps its best feature.  The car is very smooth on the highway, and despite its light weight and diminutive exterior proportions, it handles crosswinds safely, though you do feel it.  The car smothers bumps and unlike the economy cars I've owned in the past (88 Dodge Colt, 86 Chevy Sprint, 94 Kia Avella=Ford Aspire), the Accent doesn't bob and pogo on worn Los Angeles freeways.

The engine is very smooth and quiet at speed and the automatic transmission is well matched, shifting at just the right time, and while I could feel it shift, it wasn't in any way harsh or annoying.  As evidenced by the fuel economy I saw from this broken-in Accent (my rental had 7,000 miles at the start of my week) and its lively acceleration, I would buy it with the automatic over the manual.

Normally I prefer a manual transmission in a small car because small cars tend to b sporty, just as a side-effect of low weight.  Not the Accent.  This is the one area where the cars performance let me down.  The Hyundai Accent is equipped with 175/70/13 tires, that's right, 13 inch.  These are perhaps the smallest tires on any car sold today (according to Edmunds.com) and there is nothing high-performance about them.  THey are quiet in steady cruising, but howl and squeel when the road turns twisty.  I neverlost traction, but then again, I slowed down for turns that I would have taken much faster with better rubber.  Hyundai makes a GT version that has larger 14 inch tires and a sportier suspension, but with cars like the Accent, I am more interested in a low purchase price and keeping things simple.

While my test car (and all 2004 Accents) had side airbags, I obviously didn't get a chance to test them (thank goodness).  Still, including them standard was a terrific choice on Hyundai's part, and is quite unexpected on a car of this class.

If you think that I liked the Hyundai Accent, you are absolutely right.  So, you may ask, why didn't I buy one?  The answer is simple, as good as the Accent is, Hyundai just couldn't match Mazda's rebates on new Proteges.  With the total $3,500 cash back I got on the Protege, the two cars ended up costing the same.  The Accent is a very good little hatchback, but the Protege was simply a better value for the same final price (Hyundai was offering only a $500 rebate).

What really was tempting at my Hyundai dealer, however, was a very lightly used 2001 Accent, equipped exactly like my rental (minus the side airbags), with 18,000 miles (2.5 years and 42,000 miles remaining on the warranty) that I could have bought for $6,500.  I've never liked buying used, but in this instance I was VERY tempted, especially since that car drove every bit as well as the one I rented for a week.
