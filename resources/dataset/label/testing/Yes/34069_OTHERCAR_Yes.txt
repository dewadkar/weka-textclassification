            I could sum up this car with one statement. This is the only car you could feel comfortable in going up to someone in a mercedes and saying...  &quot;Mines Bigger Than Yours.&quot; and you wouldn't be lying.  That pretty much tells you what this car is.  The performance of a Mustang with the Luxury you would expect from a Lincoln.  The back seat may not be roomy but for 4 average sized people the car is very comfortable.  I have a 1992 model year Mark VII with most of the very few options available for it such as the nicer wheels premium sound system and anything else you can think of except for a sunroof.  The car has 83,000 miles on it and it still runs and looks like it's brand new, in fact most of my friends think it's a 1997 or 98.  As for power, it has a 5.0L V-8, the same as the Mustang GT had in 92, putting out 225 horsepower and 300 lb-ft. of torque.   The car can reach 60 in about 7 seconds and run the quarter mile in about 15.  I've even heard that with a cheap computer upgrade the car can run the quarter mile in like 13 seconds.  The sound system is phenomenal.  It has a 140 watt JBL amp in the trunk, from the factory, two woofers that appear to be about 8 to 10 inches in diameter with 2 midrange and 2 tweeters and in the front 2 full range drivers.  The seats can adjust to almost any concievable position and as far as reliability goes.  My godfather has had one for a few years the car is at about 200,000 miles and when he took it to the shop for an oil change the mechanic told him he was still using the factory spark plugs that came with the car.  He has never had any problem with the car.  He has never had to take it to a shop or have anything fixed.  The same holds true for me so far and from what I've heard at the Lincoln dealership I can expect to get about 300,000-400,000 miles out of the car if I do all routine maintenance.  The car is a dream to drive, it has the soft ride of a Town Car but the ability to hold the road like a Mustang.  It has smooth shifts and a quiet interior.  Lincoln used this car as a testbed for new technology so it has more gadgets and gizmos then you would ever use at one time but if you know how to use them it can make any trip more interesting.  Only problem with this car is its gas milage.  the car is advertised as having 17 city 22 highway but i've only gotten 13 average.  With gas prices the way they are this car is expensive to operate but worth it.<br><br>
