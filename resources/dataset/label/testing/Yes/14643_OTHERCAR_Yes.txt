            We purchased our 1992 GMC Safari SLE (EXT version) as a brand new vehicle in August of 1992, mere days before our third child was born. I had tried to fit three car seats into the car we traded in and it just wasn't going to happen. (we had a 6 passenger Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme) We had done our homework and test drove just about every minivan make available in town before coming back to the GMC's Safari. We had wanted a vehicle that would hold a growing family, with 4-wheel-drive capability, (since we live in snow country) and towing capability. Those requirements had seriously narrowed down our field that year. 

We have been happy over all with our Safari. Ours has the 8 passenger seating option which has two high-backed fabric bucket seats up front and two 3 passenger fabric and vinyl bench seats. The bench seats are removable but are too heavy for me to move alone-and I'm not a weak woman by any means! Behind the second bench seat there is plenty of room for the huge amount of groceries I buy to feed my &quot;army&quot; two or three times a month, and it will hold all of our luggage AND Christmas presents for our long overnight drive to Grandma's house for the holidays. (and that is one heck of a LOT of presents when there are five children involved as well as their parents, cousins and grandparents too!!) The rear tail gate of our van was the final selling point that made us choose this particular vehicle over any others. It is what GMC calls a Dutch Door and the top half of the gate swings upward while the bottom half opens to the left and right like many van doors do. This allows for a clear view behind us while driving and allows me to really pile in the groceries without them falling into the parking lot! (can you tell we like to eat, here?) The top half of the rear gate has a defogger inside the glass as well as a windshield wiper with wash feature. I find that comes in very handy around here when the snow melts into a nasty, muddy slush that completely obscures the rear window! 

Other features our van has which I like are the storage bins on the side of the trunk area to keep things like our jumper cables and First Aid Kit in. Also, three of the outside passenger seats in the rear have storage in the armrests which our children find very handy when taking that long trip to their Grandma's house for Christmas. They can put their small toys in there to keep them from becoming a hazard inside the van during transit! There are two cup holders for the rearmost outside passenger seats and two cup holders in the front console for the driver and front passenger. Our van has 4 map lights which are handy in the night. Two are for the middle bench seat and two are for the driver and front passenger seats. In the ceiling console which holds the 4 map lights, there are also two small storage areas that work great to hold our sunglasses and garage door opener and a couple of maps. One of my favorite features in this van are the height adjustable front passenger shoulder belts. I am a short person (5' 4&quot;) and it has been nice to always have my seatbelt fit in the right place on my shoulder and not scratch and irritate my neck. Also, the sliding passenger door has a catch built in the door that holds it in the &quot;open&quot; position so that when the van is parked facing downhill the door won't keep sliding closed on those trying to get in or out. I can't count how many times this has saved my children from being smashed by the door! 

Some features I wish were different or could have been added to make things better would be to have a set of vents near the rearmost bench seat so the heat, air conditioning and defroster can work back there. In wet weather, with our whole family in our Safari, the windows get so steamed up and they just won't clear, no matter how long the defroster is on! It also stays hot in the back in the summer despite having the air conditioner on, and stays cold in the back in the winter despite having the heater on. I know that was an option when we bought our van, and if we ever get another one, that will be on our &quot;have to have&quot; list! The Safari could also use more cup holders (there are NONE for the middle bench seat's passengers!) and the pair in the front could be designed better to hold the larger cups that most fast-food places have now. A McDonald's size large cup won't fit in the front cup holders because it is too tall due to the dashboard hanging out over the two front cup holders in our model. The one thing I really don't like about this van is the way the seatbelt doesn't fit comfortably for the right seat of the middle bench seat. It hits me just below my right ear and scratches and hurts even for short distances. It does this even for anyone who has ridden with us that is of an average height. I believe the design for that particular seat was poorly done. It would also be nice to have one more set of map lights for the rearmost bench seat passengers. One last gripe about this van is that the buttons that keep the buckles on the front shoulder belts from falling all the way to the floor have both fallen off which makes us have to open our front doors to retrieve our buckles so that we can buckle up as required by law. When I contacted the dealer about this problem we were told that we would need to purchase a new seatbelt to solve this problem because  we were totally beyond the warranty when this occurred. I think I'll just sew on a big button myself to take care of the problem! 

The Safari drives relatively smoothly as far as 4 wheel drives go but doesn't corner too easily. It's also a bit unnerving when the anti-lock brake mechanism kicks in and vibrates my foot when I have to stop too quickly. The 4.3 liter V8 engine gives us plenty of get-up-and-go and enough power to tow our 23 foot sailboat to local lakes in our high altitude. The gas mileage for our particular van runs an average of 18 mpg in the city and we have gotten up to 22 mpg on the highway with an average of 21mpg for highway driving. 

The durability of this vehicle has been great as far as repairs go. We have just under 65,000 miles on ours and have replaced our battery twice, the muffler once and all four tires just once. The reason for the more frequent battery replacement is due to the dome lights in our van and our children not being able to shut the sliding passenger door completely. That leaves the dome lights on and when left on overnight they completely drain the battery. When this happens too often the battery needs to be replaced. We now keep the dome light switch in the OFF position! GMC would do it's customers a service if future models of this vehicle have a built-in timer for the inside lights that would shut them off after a certain amount of time if the engine is off. I also have to say that the fabric in our van has held up so nicely despite having five children ride in it regularly! 

I would recommend this vehicle for anyone with a large or growing family, or for a smaller family that has needs to haul lots of equipment like are needed with soccer or skiing. The GMC Safari is such a versatile vehicle and I don't feel like I'm driving a minivan when I'm out running my kids to and fro in it, either.
