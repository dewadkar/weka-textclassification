            My dad has just recently bought this car. I have driven it around sometimes,
                                        and this thing has so much power. We had just driven up to Vermont, and
                                        that's right, mud season up there. The place we stay at is up hill, off a dirt
                                        road, which was all mud. THis car went up it like it was nothing. Even the
                                        neighbors pick-up couldn't make it up the first time, and he was amazed at
                                        the power. Power isn't the only thing though. This car, once it gets rolling is
                                        actually very fuel effecient for an SUV, especcially on highways. It handles very
                                        well, and rides like a BMW. It also sticks to the road very well, you could
                                        probably make a moderately sharp turn at 50 and make it. I wouldn't
                                        reccommend trying that, but you could very easily do it. This car, if you have
                                        the money to spend, get it. It's awesome, I have never seen anything else
                                        like it before. It's a little expensive, but well worth it.<br><br>
