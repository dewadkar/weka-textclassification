            Back in October of 1999, my wife and I decided that with my new job commute of 62 miles one way, my 1990 Dakota 4X4, with 165,000 miles, wasn't going to cut it. It only gets 18 MPG and I didn't want to kill it (we kept the Dakota). My commute takes me from the extreme west side of New Jersey to just 10 minutes from the George Washington Bridge along I-80. 
What we wanted was something that got good gas mileage and was a 4X4 to handle the snow and other fowl weather. With my Dakota and my wife's Pathfinder, we became spoiled to the benefits of 4X4. It was going to have to be a used vehicle (having sold Hondas for three years, I realize that the best value is a 2 to 3 year old used vehicle), because we didn't want to spend much more than $14,000. 
I got on the internet and started investigating several makes and models, Jeep Cherokee, Kia Sportage and the Subaru Outback. 
After about 3 weeks of my investigation we went out looking. We test drove a '97 Cherokee, but weren't impressed. The second dealership we stopped at was a Toyota dealer and they had a '97 Sportage and a '97 Outback. First we test drove the Kia. It was OK, but lacking head room in the back and power under the hood. The automatic transmission was also lacking crispness. Then we took out the Outback wagon. Within the first mile I was sold. This Subaru has the 2.5L engine, automatic (I would rather have the 5 speed), cruise, power windows, power mirrors, 85 watt stereo cassette, AC. The dealer was asking $12,495. The car had 70K miles on it, but according to my information, this was still a $14,500 car. My wife told the salesman that if he'd make it $12,000 even, he'd have a deal...and he did...so we did.
Here it is, now March of 2000 and no problems at all! 27 MPG, roomy (even the back seats)and I still look forward to driving it every day. It's fun to drive, very responsive and the AWD was great in all three snow storms. 
My wife's Pathfinder now has 237,000 miles on it and it's getting tired. Soon we'll be looking for her next car and, you guessed it, it'll be another Subaru...this time we'll look at a Forester.<br><br>
