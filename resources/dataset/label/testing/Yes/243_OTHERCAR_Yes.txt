            If you are thinking of buying the Canon G1 or the Nikon Coolpix 990, then this review is for you.  I have a lot of experience with each of them, and can give you a list of the pros and cons of each.  If you have narrowed your sub $1000 digital camera to these two cameras, than you are a pretty smart person, as these two cameras are the best out there, in my opinion.  
   The people at Canon have done their market research, and are listening to the consumers very well.  The desires of a hotshoe, durable body design, fast FPS, a remote control, a swiviling LCD, and longer battery life have all been addressed in this camera.  The 990 was my favorite camera for shooting people, because it always nailed the exposure and white balance perfectly, where many other digicams have failed.  Now I have switched to the Canon G1, and have no regrets.
