            This minivan has been a wonderful thing for my family.  I bought this car used about a year and a half ago.  And it is absolutely wonderful.

The sleek and stylish look mixed with the comfortable spacious interior got me stuck on this minivan.  And the fact that it drives like a car really turned me on to this minivan.  It allows my family to all travel comfortably.  

I have not had one problem with this minivan at all.  It has been smooth riding since we bought it.  The van can hold up to 7 people comfortably and if you wanted you could fit 8.  Both of the back captain chairs fold down and the bench in the back can be taken out for cargo use.  

The features in this van are very nice.  It came with cruise control, power windows, wonderful AC, and many more great features.  I would like to focus on the AC since it is summer.  The Ac has been a blessing for God.  It keeps the whole car nice and cool and we have not had 1 problem with it.  The car has great brakes which has saved us a few times.  The car has great gas mileage at 22mpg which really helps out since the raise of the gas prices. 

So if you are looking at a Mercury Villager then you are looking at the minivan.  So go out and check this car out.  I've enjoyed it and I am sure you will to.  Have a good day!!
SPACEOUT!  <br><br>
