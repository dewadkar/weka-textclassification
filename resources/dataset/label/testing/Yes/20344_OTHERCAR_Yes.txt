            Car shopping for many can be a huge hassle. Haggling over price, safety not to mention style and color can lead to a huge headache. Recently my wife and I went through the ordeal until finally deciding on the Nissan Altima. We had heard from others and did our homework and decided the car was right for us. We originally were looking for new but decided to take a used, why? Body style. I was totally turned off by the new Altima's body style. While style should not be your biggest reason for buying a car. (some might disagree). it can be the deciding vote. The new Altima is hideous. The older style was much more curvy and seductive. The new style seems to reach out and smack you in the face, saying &quot;Here I am!&quot;. The Altima is a great, affordable car, but trust me on the older models.<br><br>
