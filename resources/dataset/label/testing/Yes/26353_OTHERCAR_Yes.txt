            I picked up this Sony camera and was immediately impressed by the quality of the photos.  3.2 megapixels should be enough for just about anyone, and is more than enough to generate high quality pics with this camera.  Even on lower settings, though, this little gem proves it's worth.  

FEATURES
The camera features a 3x optical zoom backed up by a 2x digital zoom.  The optical zoom is usually enough, and won't generate any pixellation or loss of quality like a digital zoom does.  

The camera came with super long life rechargeable batteries and a small recharger.  The manual says not to use regular alkalines, so if you don't have any charged, you may find yourself in a pickle while on vacation.  Fortunately, the batteries last quite a while, and I have only once had to change over to a spare set.  

Although there is a built in flash, I rarely use it.  Even indoors, the camera takes superb photos in low light.  For still shots the SCN setting leaves the iris open a bit longer so that you don't have to use the flash.  (Obviously that won't work for action shots.)  For darker environments, you can turn on the flash and/or the red eye reduction feature if you like.  

This little baby also takes video captures.  Unlike most cameras that limit your capture to a few seconds, Sony will let you fill up your memory stick if you want.  With my 128MB stick, I could capture about 7 minutes of 640x480 video if I wanted to.  There is no microphone, so the captures are truly video only. 

The camera has many features that standard digicams and 35mm cameras don't. For instance you can set the simulated 'film speed', or the focal length to override the autofocus.

You can also trim and resize images right on the camera, but looking at the small images on the LCD display makes it difficult.  The 1.8 inch screen is big enough to act as a viewfinder, and view previous images, but I wouldn't recommend using it for any editing.

There is a multitude of resolution options, including a regular and fine setting for each resolution.  The menus seem easy enough to operate, and navigating them is a cinch.  Although I still haven't learned what some of the advanced settings do, it's nice to know they are there.  

ACCESSORIES
Aside from batteries, the camera comes with a hand strap, a memory card, and a few cords.  There is no carrying case, so you will need to pick one up to protect it.  There were two cords, a USB cord for the computer, and a yellow video cord for the TV.  

The USB cord allows files to be copied over to your hard drive, and the video cord allows you to display the photos and movies on any TV with a video input.  If you want to save your battery life, Sony sells a PC-Card adapter for your laptop, as well as a card reader for the PC.  Either one will read your memory stick.

Accessories are expensive, but the prices are coming down.  More vendors are starting to make the Sony memory stick, so there is a little competition out there.  If you splurge on a 128 or 256MB stick, you probably will never need to change it.  If you do, a neat thing about memory sticks is that they have a write protect tab, so you don't accidentally erase something.
