            I bought my 1998 VOLVO S-70 (T-5) last September after returning from living overseas for several years and being spoiled.  My last car there (In the UK) was a 1993 VOLVO 440
and I had LOVED almost everything about it except the fact that I couldn't afford to bring it back with me since it was a UK spec car and the steering wheel was on the wrong side for the USA.
  I bought the new VOLVO for $17600 including an extended waranty good for 24 months or 24000 miles from the time I bought it.
 It came with loads of bells and whistles such as AM/FM/cassette AND single CD player, power windows, mirrors, power automatic locking and keyless entry and power sun roof with wind deflector, side curtain air bags and leather interior.
  So far I'm averaging for the long run 24.0 MPG.
 The best mileage that I've gotten so far was on a road trip from Arkansas to Nebraska where I got just over 28 MPG highway most of the way.
 The car has a powerful 5 cylinder TURBO engine that is capable of great speeds if you are a weekend drag racer (the fastest that I've gotten it up to before chickening out was 115 MPH and climbing and no I'm not admitting to any law infringements here nor am I advocating extreme speeding without cause on public highways)
 This is the smoothest ride that I've had in ages.  The only thing that has come close is my aunt's Luxury car that set her back used $24000 the Avalon.
 There is a minimum of road noise with the windows up and with the wind deflector at the front of the sun roof if it is open there is not a lot of whistle as some cars without the deflector have.
 The sound system isn't show quality but can put out a decent sound level unless you are trying to entertain the entire neighborhood but only has minimal EQ built in (Bass, Trebel and fader.)
 It dosen't have heated front seats but I think that option IS available for an extra charge in some models. (My old 440 had it and it was a GREAT luxury in the winter months).
 As for handling It handles curves well and holds the road nicely but has a bit of a wide turning radius. Mine is a front wheel drive and I like the way that it handled in all of the snow and ice driving that I have done in the  winter.  There are shifting option buttons on the automatic for sport economy and winter/wet weather that do help a lot for the nasty winter that we've had. 
 The major con to VOLVOs of any variety is the service cost and replacement parts.
 A normal full service/tune up at a VOLVO garage can run into the neighborhood of $350 or more especially if there are parts to be replaced.
 The timing belt alone was quoted to me at $320 pluss labor when I took mine for a check up earlier this week.
 When I called for insurance quotes before buying it I was told by the reps at USAA and GEICO that VOLVO is in the lowest category for insurance purposes due to all of the safety features that are built into them.
 They have crumple zones in the front and rear as well as break away engine mounts so that if you are in a collision the engine won't (99% of the time) end up in the front seat occupants' laps, Air bags all round front and sides are available as well as ABS.
 For long trips the S-70 T-5 is great!
The driver side seat has 4 buttons that allow you to program the seat settings so that the whole family (mom, pop, and 2 kids) can have the seat just the way they like it and not have to spend ages getting it right after someone else drives it.
Just push and hold your button after you set it and the seat will return to the JUST RIGHT settings that you had it at last time.
 The seat can be angled up and down, raised and lowered as well as scooted forward or back and there is a dial for lumbar support as well for the front seats.
 The rear windows are child sate (only going down @1/2 way and the door locks and windows can be controlled from the driver side as well as locked out so that the driver only can raise and lower them.
 The sun roof has the option of tilting up at the back or sliding back to open completely and seals great.
 The emergency flashers button is in an inconveniant place if you get the automatic as it is located right in front of the shifter and is prone to be hit and turned on when either puting the car into or taking it out of park.
 Day time driving lights are standard and will not drain the battery if left on completely.  If you leave just the parking lights on then it MAY drain the battery if left on for an extended period of time.
 My T-5 also has reading/map lights for both sides front and back seat and a back glass defroster.
 I have had no problems with the car so far and the only time that it has been in the shop is for routine servicing.
 It is a 4 door and the back seats can be put down in several ways depending on your needs.
The seat backs in the rear are split to allow for 1 or both ro be dropped and there is a pannell in the center as well that can be dropped to allow access to the trunk from inside the car or transport of long items such as skiis or the Christmas tree and still have some room for 1-2 pax in the back.
 The front has lots of leg room, I'm 6'4.5" tall and weigh about 240-250 and have lots of leg room.  The head room is fair but I can't sit perfectly straight without brushing the roof of the car.
