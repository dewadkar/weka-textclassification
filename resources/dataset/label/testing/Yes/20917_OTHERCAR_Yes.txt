            Hehehe, what can I say? I love this car! I don�t own one�YET. But soon, very very soon we�re getting this freakish automobile. Is it a car, is it a van, is it a truck? No one knows. It can be an anything you want it to be vehicle, because it is just that versatile. It has comfortable seating for a maximum of five passengers, and there are so many extras that come with the standard price that you could drive off the lot with the base model. We actually ordered a red PT Cruiser last April, despite the ten-month waiting period, with nothing more than the basic package. It comes with a sporty 5-speed, air conditioning, power windows, radio, and that awesome design you see in the advertisements. 
	It�s based similarly on the Dodge Neon, yet it can carry more cargo despite the fact that it�s eight inches shorter. It is very similar to a four-door SUV of today, but I think it looks very reminiscent of the old Chrysler Airflow. This car has everything (or at least darn close to it), and for around $20,000, you can have it decked out with all the bells and whistles you want. 
The main reason I like this car so much is because of the external design, but it�s not just for show, this car has a very nice interior. But don�t look under the hood.  It�s not very powerful, especially if you get the automatic transmission. Chrysler has plans for making a PT Cruiser with a more powerful engine, so if you�re one of those power hungry Americans, I suggest you wait until then.
