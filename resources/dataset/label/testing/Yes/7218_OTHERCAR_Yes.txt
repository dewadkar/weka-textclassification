            A 99 red Cougar V-6 engine was rented to me by a Hertz agent who felt I really needed something to cheer me up.  I drove it about 500 miles in one
day.  It was one of the high points of my little life!  That little Cougar wanted to do 90 mph; it wanted to do more!  100!  Great control and manageability at any speed.  Tremendous power and style.  A thing of beauty inside and out.  As lovely and graceful in design as it was in hugging that road, so quiet, so smooth.  I believe it became airborne at one point.  The drive from Albuquerque to Gallup was a pleasure.  I hated to return it.  &quot;If you are weary, feeling small, if tears are in your eyes...&quot;  get behind the wheel of a Cougar, and say goodbye to the blues.
Fabulous mileage, too! I will not accept any payment for this testimonial.  There is a bright, red, beautiful streak all over my blues.<br><br>
