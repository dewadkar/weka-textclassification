            I sold a Jeep Cherokee, County model for my Mountaineer. What a huge difference! This is one great vehicle. Great comfort and driveability, especially for long trips. To me it doesn't really drive like a truck like my Jeep did.  It has most, if not all, the bells and whistles. I especially like the control button features located on the steering wheel to adjust radio/tape/CD volume and air/heat fan and temperature. The on board computer system used to track fuel level and oil life are another great convenience item.

I've had my Mountaineer for over a year now and have had zero maintenance problems.

I would recommend this vehicle to both individuals and families. Individuals because of the luxury features and feel of the vehicle, and families because of the storage space and comfortable ride and leg room. <br><br>
