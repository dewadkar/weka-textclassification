            The Agfa e1280 is a very versatile amateur camera and I do stress the word amateur I have noticed some people trying to compare this camera to pro models which is unfair it would be like comparing a VW bug to a Ferrari sure both are cars but both were designed and priced to do very different things,and for the price the 1280 do's a very nice job indeed setup on your pc is a snap using a serial bus cable link just turn the camera on play, plug in the cable to download your pics and the pc will do the rest. Onboard on the camera is a wide array of settings that are very intuitive to use including self timer,resolution,white level settings
and many more. The couple of cons that I would list are if you set the resolution to the lowest power you will not have enough battery power to take all the pics,but agfa did provide two sets of nickel metal hydride batteries and a charger,the other thing is an optional docking cradle for the memory cards my question would be why? it is absolutely not needed since you can use the camera to download the pics into your pc.Also the time between exposures is not exactly going to win any speed contests so if you think you will be able to rapid fire off photos think again it takes a while for the camera to write the image to the disk!
So if your not looking to receive the pullitzer in photojournalism or your not a fashion photographer this camera will do just fine and if you want higher resolution check out it's big brother the 1680 all the same features just higher resolution  <br><br>
