            90,000mi on a 97 Elantra and I've yet to change the brake pads.  My vehicles take a beating: I brake hard, I go over potholes and curbs, and since I lived in rural NY the car often went off-road.  I'm sometimes neglectful of even the routine maintenance (oil changes, alignments, tune-ups, etc).  I'm now in CT; highway driving is what I do mostly.  Hyundai has a 24hour roadside assistance that alleviated my fears of late-night breakdowns, but so far the car has not required me to use the service.  
I must preface that I don't know a lot about cars.  I want to post my opinion on an older model for those of you who are considering the newer ones.  After graduating from college I didn't have much cash and needed better transportation than a bicycle.  I wanted something reliable like a Volkswagon, or a used Volvo.  Besides, I remember when Hyundai was turning out lemons a few years ago.  After some research, with financial considerations winning out and little thoughts to the comfort, style, or handling of the vehicle, I went for the Hyundai Elantra.  I got a manual transmission with all the options except the ABS.
The Elantra has great gas mileage.  It's very roomy, the seats are comfy, and the sound system isn't bad.  The noise level is pretty low at high speed.  It likes to drive at 75mph; I don't like driving over 85 or 90mph in this car.  You don't feel the road very well (a soft ride?), so pushing the speed on a curvy mountain road or highway off-ramp in not-so-good weather conditions is out!  It's a fun little car to drive, considering it isn't a sports car--the turning radius is excellent!  U-turns on two-lane roads are not a problem.
One complaint I have is the cupholders.  Who makes cups that small nowadays??  It blocks out the radio panel and the lighter outlet too.  
My next car will be a Hyundai too.  I'll save my money for traveling!
