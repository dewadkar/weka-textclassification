            I purchased the Mazda MPV Minivan two weeks ago and am very impressed. I traded in a 95 Nissan Sentra when I learned that my wife and I are expecting our second child. 

I looked at many reviews before buying. I was leaning towards a Sante Fe Hyundai SUV but my wife convinced me a Mini Van was what we really needed. What held me back was reading about troubles that many Minivans have with motors and transmissions. Mazda owners seemed to have fewer problems.

I visited two dealerships the first was Town North Mazda in Richardson, TX and the Second Was Big Billy Barret in Dallas, TX. Big Billy Had a "Loss Leader" advertised in the paper at $19,949 this was $1,800 less than at Town North Mazda even after I brought the paper in and they matched Big Barry's discounts.

When I showed up at Big Barry's they had one and only one at the advertised price. It was not stripped down either. It has the 17" Alloy wheels, roof rack, and Dual Air conditioning. I felt I got a great deal. Big Billy also financed me at 5.5 % for 60 months bringing payments to $364 after Tax Title and License and a $2000.00 trade in.

The Van has a quite powerful 3 Liter V6 that can provide up to 200 horsepower. It also came with ABS Brakes and rack and pinion steering. It has a 5 Speed Transmission, which shifts very smooth and works in perfect sync with the engine.

After driving a little Sentra, I'm getting used to driving the much larger vehicle. I tend to take it more slow and easy but all in all driving this Van is a great experience. I like being higher off the ground and feel that the drive gives great control. This Van is also super quiet. Everyone can be heard in the cabin at highway cruising speeds no matter where they are sitting.


The inside seating is well thought out. The driverï¿½s side seat has two Knobs that manually adjust seat height and levelness. It is quite comfortable once adjusted properly. The first van I test drove had electric seats, which I liked less. I'm 6' feet tall and feel I have plenty of foot and headroom. 

The back seat easily folds down into the body of the van to create instant cargo space. It also folds over half way so that you can open the back door and sit comfortably to watch a game from the tailgate.

The middle seats can be configured to form a bench seat or two captain chairs. When configured as captain chairs, the driver and passenger side front seats can fold back towards them so that the people in the middle captain seats can stretch their legs over the front seats, making one long sofa. This will come in handy for over night camping.
The middle seats also can fold down towards the front to provide a tabletop to the people sitting on the back seats.

All of the manipulations are easily performed and have been well thought out.

Other features to this van include: Integrated Child Safety Seats, AM/FM Stereo CD Player, Cruise Control, Power Windows, Power Mirrors, Keyless Entry, intermittent wipers, and Tachometer.

On the bad side, the air conditioning controls are hidden from the drivers view by the shift control lever when it is in "D" for drive. After awhile I'll learn where they are by feel but it seems to be poorly thought out. The back door also seems to take more than one push when trying to shut it. I expect to get used to this over time also applying more pressure. Gas mileage is not great for this van, but it's a trade off for the extra power. It is rated at 18 MPG in the city.

The Warranty is for 3 years. 50,000 miles it could have been upgraded for $900.00 dollars. I choose not to.
