            This car really deserves a more aggressive exhaust note with it's super smooth v-6 which pumps out more than enough power with 225 hp.  I test drove a GS300 recently and was amazed with the performance that the car had to offer, accelerated 0-60 in 7 secs. Wow, even with it's heavy weight  the car accelerates quick and powerful as it really gave me the sensation of getting my back pulled into the seats when I floored the pedal.  However, shortly I realized that the self proclaimed &quot;sports sedan&quot; had a engine rev. sound of a family sedan much like the LS400.  That was one of the major reasons I decided to purchase a BMW 5 series, which is one of the direct competitors of the sports sedan models.  Other than the muted roar of the engine all the other aspects of the car are perfectly designed 
to accomodate the driver.  I would really like to compliment the car's luxury and comfort division as Lexus never falls short in terms of luxury. 
This car is very comfortable and convenient for long and short trips. All options such as auto up-down windows, 10 way power seats, and automatic tilt-telescoping steering wheel are all standard.  The only body parts I used to drive the car was my legs,arms,and my eyes, every control was in close distance to me, the driver.  The car I test drove had the premium package which virtually made the GS300 into a 400.  It upgraded the car by having a great Nakamichi sound system which delivers 280  watts, leather upholstery, and heated seats.  I would recommend this car to anyone with a luxury minded individual who prefers luxury and performance.      <br><br>
