            I recently needed a digital camera for my wife to use with her horticulture business. I did extensive shopping both online and in the stores. After reading several reviews and playing with several cameras I bought the Nikon Coolpix 800.  It has turned out to be an excellent value.

The camera has the absolute easiest menu. The functions are laid out simply and clearly without a lot of the non-sensical symbols found on other cameras. The camera is easy to operate and requires only a minimal number of steps for each function. It has a fool proof automatic mode, and a fairly comprehensive manual mode for people with a little more photography experience. The compact flash card is easy to use and seems more durable to me that the smart media card.(It also is available up to 128MB if you can afford it)The camera operates on 4 AA batteries or the rechargeable batteries. Although a longer lasting battery pack would be nice, it's good to know if you need batteries in an emergency you can find them at any store for a low price. The power consumption is about the same as all digital cameras, but is quite manageable if you make only minimal use of the LCD.  

The photo quality is superb. My wife and I don't want to worry too much about changing the settings every time we take a picture, so we don't alter them much. She takes pictures of all kinds of plants/flowers/ shrubs/, including macro photos, outdoors and indoors, under all sorts of lighting conditions. Whether using a 1600x1200 or a 640x480, the photos come out great. The maximum resolution photos come out great and even shows excellent detail when magnifying. Once again switching between the modes, deleting photos or downloading to the computer is all done with a few easy steps. 

If you want a camera that takes great photos, is easy to use, and is backed by a company known for it's great quality lens, this camera is the one. Shop online, I saved $200 by buying it over the internet. Don't worry it still came new in a box with an extended 4 year warranty. <br><br>
