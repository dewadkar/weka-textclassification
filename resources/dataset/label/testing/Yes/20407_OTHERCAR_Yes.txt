            I just bought a 2000 Jetta GLX and it's one sweet ride, but when it came to paying for it, I got taken for one. It's a great car, don't get me wrong, but I made what I feel is a poor decision in shelling out a few thousand more for the GLX model. I decided to splurge for the GLX and go top-of-the-line, but I really don't think it was worthwhile. In fact, most of the best features in my GLX are available as options on all models. There's no reason to buy the GLX to get the V6, for example. Some GLS models offer it. Since so much has been written about the Jetta already, I'll confine myself to advising you on whether or not to go for the GLX model.

VW Jetta feature comparison:

The pricing strategy of the Jetta is to offer a nice range of customizeable options: leather, sunroof, V6, etc. But the kicker is that they've thrown a few exclusive bells and whistles into the high-end GLX, in an effort to make you go for broke. If you get suckered into the GLX, bear in mind you will also be buying ALL of the standard options like leather seats, just to get those last few bells and whistles. I would recommend in general that you find an in-between model that has the options you want, and save yourself a few thousand by avoiding the GLX.

Here's what you get extra in the GLX and why I don't think it's worth it.

EXCLUSIVE (and expendable) IN THE GLX:

These are the options you only get in a GLX Jetta, and why I don't think they're worth it.

Power memory seats. This is the feature that will save 3 seat and mirror postions for you, allowing you to switch between them witht he touch of a button. Excellent for couples who have to share a car, or for people who want one city driving position and one more comfortable highway driving position. A great feature, although I don't find it works very well. At all, actually. I have set the memory positions repeatedly, but the car keeps forgetting them. You cannot switch memory positions while the engine is on (for safety reasons), and even with the car stopped you have to hold the memory position button in the entire time it's changing. No one-touch and go unless the door is open and the engine off. Sound complicated? It is. Do I use it? Never.

Self-dimming mirror. The rearview mirror has a small eye beneath it which points backward, and in low-light, will detect headlights behind you. When headlights come up behind you, the mirror darkens itself, becoming the tint of a blueish sunglass lens. This feature works reliably. Never goes off in the daytime and definitely saves some eye strain on the highway at night. BUT: it's also out of your control. Sometimes you may want full visibility, even if it is a bit painful, and you won't be able to control the mirror's tint. It looks much as if you had dark window tinting on your back window, and not all drivers will appreciate this. A simple, hand-operated tilt mirror is fine for me. I'll use it occasionally: while being tailgated by an SUV at night, for example, but most of the time I'd rather turn this feature OFF. Can't.

Electronic Climate Control. AKA a friggin' thermostat. This is just not worth it in my opinion. With doors opening and windows going up and down, there's too much ventilation in a moving car for the cab's air temperature to be finely controlled. I just prefer to be able to turn on hot air, or cold air. Immediately. By cranking a big old knob. With this fancy electronic control system, you have to turn the fan on, pressing again and again until it reaches the blow level you want, and then you have to press the red temperature button until you reach a temperature you want. So to turn on a blast of hot air can be as many as 14 button pushes! Irritating! Also a problem with the electronic controller is that it forgets which vents it's set to every time you turn it off. If you had it on face vents last time you drove, get ready to set it to face vents again. It defaults to all vents every single time it's turned off. Annoying in winter, when I want it to stay on windshield defrost all the time. 

Rain sensor. Neat. Kind of nice. Repalces intermittent wipers. Rather than just swiping every minute, the wipers swipe when a certain amount of water has collected on the windshield. Theoretically, you should not get the spine-tingling squeak of wiper on dry glass, ever. BUT, in my experience, it's impossible to set the threshold of the sensor low enough. A LOT of rain has to collect before these things will swipe, and that's on the most sensitive setting. Not worth it, overall.

Heated windshield spray nozzles. Give me a break.

Special wheels. Okay, whatever. 

Trip computer. This is kind of cool. It's nice to see your average speed on any given trip, your average gas mileage overall. Things like that. But not terribly useful. Just a toy tacked on to get you to go for broke.

Rear sunshade. Stupid. It's a piece of cloth that unrolls. Big deal. 

BOTTOM LINE:
I like the V6 and the Monsoon stereo. They're great. I could probably have done without the leather seats and the above bells and whistles. The sunroof is indispensable, but the dimming mirror and rain sensor... not worth it. I wish I had bought a GLS with a V6, sunroof, and Monsoon stereo. That would have made me perfectly happy. The wood dashboard effects on the GLX look out of place on what is, frankly, supposed to be a young person's economy sedan. I'd say that the value curve drops way off as you approach the high end of the Jetta line, and you should stick to the base options you really want and skip the rest. These things can get expensive if you go all the way, as I did. About now I'd rather have the $5000 back.
