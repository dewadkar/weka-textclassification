            2001 Dodge RAM 1500 Quad Cab Automatic

We vowed never to buy a new car again.  It was the whole litany of it losing 3 grand in value as you drive it off the lot.  Plus, we;d found lots of used cars that were great deals...why did we need to get NEW.

Because the Dodge RAM 1500 Quad cab truck was sitting there smiling at us, that's why. We took it for a test drive and loved it.  Bought it, drove it home, and loved it more.

This truck is fun to drive, big, burly but only requires a light touch in handling.  My wife, who is fairly slight, drives it all the time (it's OUR version of the minivan without the stigma attached) and loves it to death.  It's got great capacity inside and out (we have the regular 6' bed), and great power.

The QUAD CAB is and excellent option; with the TWO doors that open in the back.  We looked at Ford F-150s but just didn't feel good about them; plain styling, single door in the back, not to mention the Ford dealer treated us like idiots.  

There is plenty of sitting room in the back for regular sized people.  If you have long legged people up front, your long legged passengers may be a little cramped in the back but if the front seats are moderately forward, you should have plenty of room back there.

Our two kids (3 and 5) can climb in and out easily, although they DO climb.  This truck is high even with stock tires and I would recommend getting either the side steps or a set of nurf bars for just that reason.  They make entry and egress much easier even for grown ups.

I would recommend a bed liner as well.  It just saves your paint job and prevents scrapes that can rust.  And if you're going to haul a lot, don't rely on screwing a ball into the back frame.  Go with a full hitch bolted underneath.  They're not that expensive and you can be assured of hauling large loads if need be.

Whatever you do, get the bars, liner and hitch after market.  The dealer gets you on these by about 25% or more.  Hold off on the extras till after you're home so you have a chance to evaluate your needs and get the pricing you want.  You will save a few hundred bucks at least.

There is a full bench seat in the back and a full compliment of safety restraints including on for the middle passenger in the back and front making this a true 6 passenger truck.  However, the middle passenger in the front might be cramped by the drink console (if not folded up) and the 4WD stick.

This is a truck.  It's not a commuter car so don't count on good mileage.  We get about 12 on the big V-8 with 75% city style driving and 25% highway.  

The truck fits in the average sized garage (although I would bet the long bed at 8' wouldn't).

One thing I would like to get is tires that fit the wheel wells.  This only for looks as the stock tires look kinda puny in that big space.  But there IS space so you can add fairly large tires without having to add a lift kit and mess with the warranty.

The price is good for the amount of truck you get, too.  A lot of truck, a lot of power, good utility and comfort inside.  This is one of the better vehicles I have owned and I would highly recommend at least a test drive if you are in the market for a new (or even used) pickup.  

One other note.  There have a been a few recalls on the 2001s but we have not had the problems so I am thinking the issues are isolated to only a few trucks.
