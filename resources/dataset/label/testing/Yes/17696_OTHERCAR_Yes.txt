            I bought my 1994 used Saturn SL 2 1/2 years ago.  It has been a joy to drive and has never caused me problems.  It handles like a dream, even in the rain which makes Los Angeles' streets and freeways slippery as ice.

If you're looking for a maintenance free, dependable car, you should get a Saturn.  It has more power than you would expect from looking at it, and makes a great family car.

I would highly recommend a Saturn to anyone looking for a used car.  They're very dependable and easy to drive.  They're affordable and hold up very well.  I plan on keeping my Saturn for several more years.  And when it comes time to get a new car, I'm getting another Saturn.  Not only are the cars great, but the customer service at the dealership is everything you've heard it was and more.  They really make you feel like you made the right choice when you buy it, and after you drive it, you'll know you made the right choice with a Saturn.<br><br>
