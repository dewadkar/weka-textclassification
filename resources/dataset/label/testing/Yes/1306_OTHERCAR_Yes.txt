            Being a trusting consumer of Toyota vehicles, I needed a vehicle for the family to hit the back roads of Idaho.  Our van just didn't like the abuse of the dirt roads and unimproved camping areas.  I have come to admire the  usefulness of the 4-Runner in off-road and city driving.  The availability to shift to 4WD while still moving is wonderful.  I have been getting about 20 mpg while in the city.  3 years of regular oil changes with no mechanical problems whatsoever.  I know a new vehicle should be problem free, but that is not my experience with other makes.

The interior is big enough for four comfortably, but can fit more.  The rear seats fold down easily for any large cargo you need to bring home from the Home Improvement stores.  This does however reduce the amount of passengers.  Cup holders are available, but I feel Toyota could have spent  some more time and money on making them better(not a big deal).

Anyone who would like a SUV that is excellent in the city as well as the country will enjoy the experience of driving/riding the 4-Runner.
