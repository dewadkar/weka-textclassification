            My husband and I just bought this vehicle last month.  We're the parents of 2 kids and have 2 more on the way.  We needed a vehicle with ROOM!  I was convinced we would have to buy a mini van to get the room we need, but this Durango offered an exceptional alternative.  (I wasn't too excited about driving a mini-van -- and with the price of cars these days everyone should be excited about driving it!!)

I love the 3rd row seat.  Our six-year old thinks that is her own space back there and her feet can actually rest comfortably on the floor as opposed to dangling in traditional car seats.

I dislike the back door because of the weight of it.  It is very easily opened but requires both hands to close it (not always easy with kids in tow).

Driving this vehicle is very comfortable.  We drove a Ford Expedition when we bought the Durango and the Durango is much less bulky to drive.  The Expedition felt like a boat in comparison.  I've made several long drives in it already and it was very comfortable.

I think this a great family vehicle with lots of room.  The SLT comes with everything you need.  Enjoy!<br><br>
