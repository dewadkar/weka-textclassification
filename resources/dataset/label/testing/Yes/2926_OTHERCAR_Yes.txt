            I recently purchased thr rsx-s and can say that it seems to be a great value for the money. I had considered a 2002 Celica, but after driving both and looking at the difference between what you get on the Acura vs. what's optional on the Toyota this made up my mind.

Not only are the standard features generous, but the warranty is 1 year and 14,000 miles longer.

Now for the driving impressions, I have owned BMW's and other Toyota Celicas and I have to say this car is equal to any of them. Power does come on about 5000 rpm and rockets to the 8000 rpm redline. Handling for the spirited driving I do is more than adequate, I didn't buy this car to be a road racer so it's perfect.

Two things about the car that some may find objectionable. There are no side mouldings, so watch where you park. Secondly the stereo sound is great and has great acoustics, but for those that prefer a very high volume, it just won't do it. To me these are minor things and it wouldn't and did not deter me from this purchase.

In closing I personally feel this car offers more fun and features than other comparable vehicles in it's class.
