            My wife is an avid 35mm camera buff and is still not sold on digital photography. Well I came across a good deal on a Polaroid PDC 1300 camera and despite some shortcomings, I am quite impressed of what you get for the price.

First of all, Windows XP users may be a bit frustrated. The camera will not work with the simple and easy to use "built in" digital camera software that works so well with scanners and other input devices. So, you have to install the Polaroid software though a compatibility wizard. It installs but I was unable to use the USB cord, so I had to go with the much slower (seems like it) serial plug. A good solution would be to spend a little extra money and get a universal CompactFlash reader that works like a disk device in Windows XP. Makes it much easier!

Now, on to the camera. It takes really good pictures. They are clear and crisp at all resolutions. The only bad picture I had was when I was taking pictures outside at dusk. They seemed to be quite dull. There isn't an adequate zoom on the camera, so you really have to move in to fill the frame. The LCD screen and the menu options work quite well and are an added bonus for the low cost to the camera. 

The included software is pretty basic but if basic is what you want, XP's software is much easier and faster to use. Windows 95/98/ME users will have no problems installing the software.

The camera consumes the batteries quite quickly, so be sure to turn it off when not in use. The LCD screen also eats a lot of power. When the batteries are low, there really is no warning and when you go to take a picture, it will flash and then turn off. I would recommend taking a pocketful of batteries with you on trips. 

It also includes a USB and Serial cord, a protective case and an 8 Meg card. I would recommend getting at least a 32 meg card. 

Overall, if you can find this camera for under $200.00, it is a great price and very good for basic use. Those wanting more features are better off with one with more "bells and whistles."
