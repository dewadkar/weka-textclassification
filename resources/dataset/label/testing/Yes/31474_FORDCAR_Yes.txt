            When in the market for cars about three years ago, what i wanted was a fast car that i could keep throughout high school and college, and sell upon graduating and getting my first real job. I was stuck for the longest time trying to decide between a 1988 BMW M3 or M5 and a 1990 Mustang GT. Each car had its benifits. The BMW's were more luxerious, A little more rounded, and newer looking. However The mustang was just plain fast, and beautiful.  When i started test driving cars in the $10, 000 price range i found that all the beamers were either horribly beat up either on the inside, the outside, or mechanically. Upon looking at the mustangs, i found my baby with a mere 32,000 miles on it. It was gorgeous, bone stock, two tone silver paint,and in perfect condition. After purchasing it i did all the things i have always wanted to do to a muscle car. I put on saleen rims, spark plugs, wires, cobra intake, K&amp;N filter, big beefy BF goodrich 225-55-ZR16,100w hella foglamps, xenon headlight halogen conversion, white face gauges, clarion deck, mb quart components, precision power amps,and jl subs.

The thing i love best about the car is that it is so mechanically sound, i have had it for 3 years and the only thing that has gone wrong was that an oxygen sensor broke ($15.00) and one brake light went out ($1). I highly recommend this car for anyone that doesn't have to make a long commute to work, has a little money for gas (only 13mpg), and wants a really fast car.

The only things i found annoying with the car is that the trunk is tiny, and the suspension could be a little better, but then again if that was my most important thought i would have bought the BMW M3
