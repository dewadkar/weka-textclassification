            This is my second Saab and first-ever convertible. As a marque, Saab may be quirky, but it's the quirks that give Saabs their undeniable charm. Unlike virtually anything else on the road today, my Saab still turns heads, thanks in part to the manufacturer's great factory-installed &quot;Styling Value Package.&quot;(The package includes special BBS 16 in. alloy wheels, stainless-steel exhaust system and tailpipe, front air dam and side/read lower body cladding, and rear-deck spoiler. The exhaust note alone is positively breathtaking!)

My experiences with this car have been, in the main, extremely positive. It's very reliable, well-built, and, so far, mechanically trouble-free. The only problem I've had to date is with the electrically-operated soft top. Until an adjustment was made by the dealer's service team, the top would stall in the middle of its closing routine (a symphony of whirring solenoids, folding canvas, and closing tonneau covers -- when it works properly), and I would have to give it a tug to get it to continue. That problem's been fixed now, but since then, a new glitch in the closing routine has developed. This one's only a minor inconvenience.

The light-pressure turbo of the 9-3SE gives this car far more acceleration its 4-cylinder engine might suggest. It can blow the living doors off our other car, a 6-cylinder 1999 Audi A-6. Yet, because it's a 4-cylinder engine, I get great gas mileage in the Saab: averaging 30 mpg highway, 25 mpg city.

Reviewers in the automotive press often criticize Saab's quirkiness and idiosyncratic styling. In this age of homogenized aero-boxes, Saab dares to be different. I only hope that, under GM's majority ownership, the marque doesn't lose any of its traditional uniqueness. <br><br>
