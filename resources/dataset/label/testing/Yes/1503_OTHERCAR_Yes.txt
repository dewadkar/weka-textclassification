            My Husband and I were in the market for a used vehicle that was good looking, and would be right for our family.  We came upon this car from a used car dealer and it has been wonderful!!  It handles like a dream, has great pickup and cornering ability.  I do hate the fact that the base model, which I own, only has speakers up front not in the back like most cars will, but besides that, it has been a wonderful car.  I am very loyal to manufacturers that make a solid product, and this is as solid as they come!!  The car handles almost like some very expensive sports cars, has great pickup when needed even up steep hills, and it will take a corner at a higher rate of speed than it looks like it would.  I have had to do some city driving in Atlanta, and it gets me through traffic like a charm!!  It comfortably seats 4 adults, with a lot of room to spare!!  The trunk area is enormous, and you can get the seats down if you needed more room.  It has been a great car to have and when I am in the market for another car, Saturn will be my #1 choice!!

My only concern was for some of the buttons to control the heat/cooling system.  They should not be below eye level for safety sake, they need to move them up higher in the console.  Other than that, it heats and cools wonderfully!!

I have the 5 speed model, the gear shifting is wonderful, I have had many people comment that they could not feel the shifts happening.  I have always driven a stick shift, and this has been the smoothest shifting car that I have ever driven.<br><br>
