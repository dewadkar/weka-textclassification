            I purchased my Eclipse RS in August of 1997 brand new. It was a standard, had a sun roof, AC, and that is about it. It was my first car out of college and the first car I had ever bought without my parents. This little car was the best thing I had ever driven.

The things that made me purchase the car was how cute it was, the reasonable price, the fact that the dealer took my old car as a trade in, and how I knew all my friends would be jealous. At the age of 22 I didn't think much past those features.

I love a lot of things about that car, it could take a corner so smoothly and it could turn on a dime. The fact that it was a standard made the 2.0 engine seem like it was a 5.0 and it could take most cars of &quot;the line&quot;, even the Ford Mustang I raced a week after I bought it, though in the long run he got me by a mile.I got great gas mileage, averaging 33 miles per gallon, which was great when the gas prices were rising out of control. I also loved how comfortable the front seat were. They were height adjustable which really helped when I was still driving it at eight months pregnant. I also love this car because in the three years and 55,000 I owned it for I never had to take it in for any major maintenance problem.

The major thing that I disliked about this car was the lack of room in the back seat. I could never have more than three people in the car at once, one in the back seat and two in the front. I also had a minor problem with wind noise on the driver side window which we could never seem to get fixed. 

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a nice, fast, reliable car who does not have small children or a lot of people to drive around. I just replaced my Eclipse because I could not see how I would be able to  easily place and remove a child seat from the car (I still own it I just don't drive it). It really is a great little car and a lot of fun to cruise the beach with and just drive around for no reason. It is also reliable and economical enough to drive everyday and everywhere. It was always a joy to zoom around in.
