            For the shutter bug wanting a taste of digital photography without spending much money, this is a good camera to try.

You can take fair pictures with surprisingly good colors but only in the right conditions.  Plenty of light is required...forget using the flash, its either too bright or too dark. I tried a little black tape over part of the flash to tone it down....except for an amusing puff of smoke when the flash hit the tape (I'm telling you its bright!) I seldom got a good picture.

Battery cost is a problem.  The battery, at $2.00 a pop, doesn't last long enough and using the included power supply when downloading pics is a must.


I still like the camera, it fits in your pocket, can take a fair picture, and if you can get it for under $60 you really haven't lost much if it falls in the lake. Personally, I got one to try out digital photography before buying that "expensive" camera, and for what I learned I got my money's worth.
