            A few weeks ago I decided it was time to get rid of my 98 Grand Am for something newer, and better.  I drive about 40 miles a day to work, and travel semi-occasionally, so a good car is important to me.  My old Grand Am was doing ok, but it was getting close to 60K in mileage, and I still owed quite a bit on it, so I was getting worried it wouldn�t last until it was paid for.

So I went shopping, and I looked around at several different cars and dealers, and finally decided I wanted a new Grand Am.  I have always liked the Grand Am, for every generation of it, the car has looked good in comparison to other cars of the time.  Never has that been truer then the redesigned Grand Am that has been on the roads since, I believe 1999.  The new body style is bold and attractive.  So here�s what I ended up with.  Having a need for decent things, I settled on the GT1 version of the Grand Am, because it�s the nicest.  Now normally I might have gotten a car with a little less on it, but I wanted an �02 to get the rebate ($3,000 at the time) and this is all the dealer had left, about 6 of the same car, all GT1�s.  So my car has the 175 HP Ram Air V-6, leather interior, sunroof, CD Player + Cassette  + the excellent Monsoon Audio system, with 8 speakers, etc.  It�s got a performance suspension, power everything (including driver�s seat) � basically all the bells and whistles.  It�s a great car, and at a sticker price of 23K it�s packed with features.  I got it at invoice though (about 22K) and also the 3K rebate, so all in all I paid about 19K for it, comparable to a base model Grand Am, price-wise.

<b>So how does it drive you ask?</b>
Well to be honest pretty well, although for the weight of this car (a whopping 3200 lbs, roughly) the 175 HP engine is good � but not great.  So far the suspension seems to be smooth and the car rides great overall, with just slight wind noise at high speeds, but with the Monsoon Audio it more than covers that up.  All the controls are very easy to get to, mine has steering wheel radio controls, but even if it didn�t the radio console on this car is easy to reach, being tilted towards the driver for that reason.  Acceleration is good, again not great, but it�s more than ample for normal driving.  

So I have to say, this car drives well, looks great, is packed with features � and all at an affordable price.  Comparable to other cars with the same features I would say this is a great deal.  And it really is an awesome looking car.

<b>Some of the added features I really like about it:</b>
--The rear cornering lights are handy when backing in tight spots at nighttime and DO actually help a lot. 
--The steering wheel radio controls are SO handy and you don�t have to take your eyes off the road to adjust things.  I can change stations, volume levels, and change between AM/FM/or CD without reaching over.  I can even mute the whole sound system with one steering wheel button.  All the other controls in this car are well placed also, easy to get to, easy to use for the most part.
--The sunroof is a nice added feature on this car, as are the bigger, performance tires.
--The radio has both a CD and tape player, so either works in this car
