            Briefly, this SUV rides like a sedan, is reliable, looks good, and is comfortable on long rides.  Only negative, and this is the third pathfinder i've leased since 93, is the dashboard controls for ac, radio, etc. are a little hard to reach at times, esp if you're tall and ride with the seat further back than most people.  

nissan customer service ain't great, and their service departments the california bay area leave much to be desired -- very different experience from the sales experience, which has improved a great deal since 93.
