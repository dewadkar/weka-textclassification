            Hi folks,

One of the popular reviews on this vehicle is written by someone extremely uninformed about cars in general, and his name is &quot;roadtripper&quot;. Not only does he lay blame on the car for simple and inexpensive repairs that he should have known he had to do, but he admits that he &quot;fell in love&quot; with the car and bought it that night, and yet for some reason, all of his complaints didn't surface until he &quot;saw it in the light.&quot;

I was just going to leave a comment, but I felt this required a review, so that everyone who might be persuaded to believe the misguided young man could see the truth.

I will also be reviewing the car itself in the next 'installment.'

Dear roadtripper,

First, shame on you for not doing your homework first and then whining as if it were the car's fault. What did you really expect of a cheap used car that has a three-cylinder engine composed primely of motorcycle parts at a whopping 52 horse power? A used car that, even more so, was only $8,000 when it was a year old and had 15k miles on it? Most cars today would only depreciate about a thousand with that little mileage, and that just goes to show how bloody cheap Metros are -- and cheap in price equals cheap in components. What $9,000 new car exists today that you would buy? You, like everyone else, would be awfully suspect of such a low price tag. Had you never heard the phrase, &quot;too good to be true&quot;?  What did you expect, gold plating?

<b>The Leaking Convertible Roof</b>
Secondly, convertible roofs are consumable items. If your roof leaks, you replace it, and it only costs a few hundred dollars. Furthermore, the back window on the 92 Metro LSi convertible is sew-in style and can be replaced separately for just $80, including labor. You should've taken the car to the shop, like any other sane person, and for less than the cost of dinner for two at a nice restaurant, your car's interior would have been spared the elements and we would have been spared your uninformed whining.

<b>Lack of Foresight</b>
I have a Geo Metro LSi (the convertible) and while I would not exactly sing its praises, I feel you gave it a very bad rap just because you waltzed into the car store and bought the car based on no actual research whatsoever. You were &quot;hooked;&quot; you &quot;fell in love.&quot; Bad idea, kiddo.

Think: would you laugh at a person who buys a house without looking inside, and who then complains that the interior is in crummy shape? Of course you would. You executed the same level of foolishness when you &quot;fell in love&quot; and brought the car home without ever taking a good look at it. If you had, you would have realized BEFORE you plunked down money that it was a &quot;girlie&quot; car, BEFORE you plunked down money that the interior parts were plastic and the exterior seemed flimsy, BEFORE you plunked down money that it was slow (did you not realize that 52 horse power is half that of even a Corolla!? Did the 400  lb weight limit not clue you off?) Did the car metamorph overnight? Was it not the same car you just &quot;fell in love&quot; with? 

<b>Comfort and Other Details</b>
Firstly, if you set foot in the car, you could tell that everything is plastic. Actually, everything in other cars is plastic too, unless it's metal or wood (unusual). Maybe you don't consider vinyl door linings or dashboards plastic, but that's what vinyl is. What do you want, a burl wood accents?

As far as the shakiness of the car goes... of course it shakes. You take any awesome car and kill a cylinder (the 92 model in question has only 3 cylinders), leaving an odd number of cylinders, and that car will shake as well. Ever wonder why there aren't more 5 cylinder cars? Now you know. If it's a convertible, it'll shake even more, because solid roofs offer a lot of structural integrity to a car, and without one, all of that integrity is lost. That's like saying a convertible should have a roof rack.

<b>Reliability</b>
As for the timing belt and other issues... I guess if you managed to test drive it and still not realize that the car takes about 20 seconds to get up to 60mph from 0 mph, that you also bought it trustingly from the used car dealer without having a good mechanic look it over. I have just one word for that: &quot;Duh.&quot; Used car dealers are so notorious for screwing trustful people over that they have become the icon of American sleaziness. Not to say that all used car dealers (or mechanics) are bad, but the stereotype is so pervasive in the culture that I can't believe anyone would walk in and buy a car without an independent inspection. If they do, they lose all complaining rights.

And frankly, I doubt how well you took care of the car. Any car will break down if it is not regularly maintenanced, including as someone else pointed out, a Lexus. Just doing oil changes isn't enough, either. If you didn't even know about the $80 sew-in back window to prevent all the leaking (it has to be replaced!), how could a reader trust your review on the car's reliability? Not to mention that a mechanic should have noticed the timing belt if you had it in for any sort of regularly scheduled maintenance, like your 30k one. Especially considering you're supposed to do regular maintenance every 30k miles (and your timing belt broke at 32k!), and a routine check-over before any very long, grueling road trip (a Geo Metro broke down on a mountain overpass?! You're kidding me!). It's one of the first things they check, whether it's due to be done then or not.

<b>Overall</b>
If you pick a lemon, it's not the car's fault, it's yours. Your car wasn't actually a lemon but due to your lack of care for it, you lost out. When I read your review, roadtripper, I busted out laughing -- for anyone to buy a 52 horsepower, 3-cylinder car, and then complain of its slowness... well, it was a truly humorous moment, and I thank you. That also says just about everything about the review that anyone need know, despite my long spiel.<br><br>
