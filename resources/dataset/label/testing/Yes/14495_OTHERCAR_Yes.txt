            In August of 1999 my wife and I purchased a 1999 Hyundai Sonata GLS.  This car came standard with 170 HP V6, sunroof, wood grained interior panels and a whole lot of ride for the money.  We paid about $15,000 for this car.  After comparing the Hyundai to Chevy Malibu (which we almost bought), Toyota Camry (nearly $10,000 more), VW Jetta, Dodge Cirrus, Honda Civic, and Ford Taurus we fell in love with the Sonata.  

The car comes with a 170 HP V6 (optional except on GLS), ABS, driver and passenger air bags, beautiful styling, and excellent interior space.  The only thing that may be a drawback is the trunk space which I believe is about 3-4 cubic feet smaller than the Malibu.  But the trunk is still large enough to hold 4 weekend bags very easily plus a bunch of other stuff.  This car makes up for the lack of trunk space with a super quiet and smooth ride.  I consider the ride tops of all the models we tested.  The seats are a little firm, but offer excellent support for all but the longest drives.  We had to stop every 3 hours or so just to walk around on a long trip.  The gauges and radio are all well located, but are more accessible to the driver than the front seat passenger.  Our model came with both CD player and Cassette player.  Plus we have a fold down rear seat arm rest with storage for rear seat passengers.  Very helpful for keeping our children apart on long trips, and comfortable for friends on trips around town.  But maybe the best thing about Hyundai is that they give you a 5 year warranty bumper to bumper on the vehicle, 10 years on the power train, and a 3 year roadside service similar to AAA all free.  Talk about peace of mind. 

If you are interested in a very nice car in the small to midsize range the Hyundai Sonata deserves a hard look.  We were very surprised at the quality and warranty.<br><br>
