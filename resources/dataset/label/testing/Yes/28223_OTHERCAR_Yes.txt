            It all started out when we needed the extra third seat. Actually, I fell in love with the Dodge Durango.  It was a real big decision, since the vehicle was so expensive.  We finally made our minds up about the color, leather seats, and the running boards. We ordered it  around Christmas time and the day before Valentines Day it was in.  We were so happy.  Shall I say, we were real happy until alot of things started going wrong. It seems like our beautiful vehicle was turning into a nightmare! First of all, the power window and locks stopped working! On top of that, the air conditioner, defroster, and heater stopped working. Then, soon the fog lights went on the blink,  Imagine That!!!!  Well, needless to say these items were fixed, and now we are having problems with the heater a second time.  Oh well, These days what do you really get for your money????<br><br>
