            Go out and take a good long test drive in this car to really see whether it fits you or not.  If you like a soft controlled cruising car that gets good fuel economy for its size, has a low real delivered price, this might be the car.  Despite the fact it has a 4 cylinder engine, it has adequate get up and go once the engine is allowed to warm up fully.  The engine noise below 4,000 RPM is hardly even noticeable inside the car.  It cruises well on the interstate at highway speed and as a bonus gets good highway fuel economy.  The amazing thing is how well the fit and finish is on the body.  If you carefully look at several of the cars you can really see how the detail of the assembly of the metal really stands out.  The paint job is one of the best looking I have seen from just about any make of car, it looks as though it has real depth to the paint.
It is with the interior where the minor flaws are really found.  Some of the earlier cars had slightly mismatched plastic colors, Possibly because the dash was getting vinyl guard and the rest was not.  The air conditioning on max makes a bit of noise, but it works well.  There are other minor details, but just look to see which ones you notice and how important those are to you, some things might really bother one person while be totally unimportant to someone else.
The overall feel of sitting in the car is good, especially after careful adjusting of the seat and driving position.  I am 5' 9'' and had plenty of room in front and rear.
To specifics of initial impressions on my first test drive.  Car was extremely quite going down the road, except for slight wind noise.  Acceleration seemed very weak when I first started driving the car.  I found out that once the engine warmed up the engine accelerated MUCH better, but did have some good sounding engine noise when really pushed.  The car had no problems maintaining highway speed even up hills.
The more I drove the car, the more it seemed like a much nicer car than most others in the $15,000 and under range.  I like a soft almost quite ride and good fuel economy.  If you are looking at cars in this lower than average price per feature range, you really should take a long drive in this one.  Other cars with similar equipment in this price range I also looked at, Dodge Neon, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Used Toyota Camry, Used Buick Century, Hyundai Sonata.
Many of the So-Called expert reviews simply dismiss this car from the very beginning.  There is very little on the market in this price with this kind of a nice ride.  No, this car is not going to please everyone.  If you want neck shattering performance, sport sedan handling, or the same car everyone else says you should drive, this is not for you.  If you want a car with a near luxury ride like the larger cars some of us grew up in years ago, but with better fuel economy, you might really like this car.  

Now if we only knew for sure that Daewoo had really good reliability.  But given the big current price discounting on the Daewoo cars, you can afford the extended warranty for at least the first many years you own the car.  As to So-Called residual value when you go to trade in your car, just plan on the car not being worth much at the end just in case. If you trade cars every couple of years, you are probably better off leasing in the long run any way.  If you keep cars almost forever, you already know the difference in actual value is very little at the time you get rid of it, unless it is a collector car.
