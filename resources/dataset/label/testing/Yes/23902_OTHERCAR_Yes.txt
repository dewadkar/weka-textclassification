            The TT under review is a 180 hp, FWD, 16&quot; Wheels.  

Ergonomics:  Seats are very comfortable.  Full leather with excellent support.  Can sit for hours without getting sore.  The seats do not hold the driver in place as much as I would like at the speeds that the TT can take the corners.  The gauges are all well placed and very viewable.  All the controls are easy to use.  The only door lock when sitting in the car is in the center console which takes getting use to.  Also the switch for the electric windows takes a little getting use to.  The window goes down until you hit the switch again.  The rearview mirror adjuster feels a little cheap and is difficult to use.  The stereo is easy to access and easy to use.  The steering wheel is very nice.  It moves up and down and also telescopes allowing you to put it in exactly the right position for you.  The sound of the engine from inside the car is quiet yet there is a high performance groan to the motor that will please most gear heads.  The automatic ventilation system although it works correctly I still do not know how to turn off the AC.  The cruise control works perfect and finger tip controls are very accessible.

Driving: The car is a kick.  It tracks around corners just as you steer it.  It holds the road and provides neutral steering around corners.  Backing off on the gas in a corner causes some oversteer but it is quickly recovered by making small adjustments with the steering wheel or reapplying throttle.  The steering is very precise it feels like a race car.  The car is fast enough to pass cars on the freeway quickly and nimbly but having a little more quickness would be fun.  I was able to follow five other TT's through some mountain roads and watching them in front of me was exceptionally impressive.  The cars look like they get sucked around the corners with no body tilt what so ever.

Cargo:  The car has back seats but don't let anyone sit back there.  Fold the seats down and you can carry two bags of golf clubs and enough luggage for two people for a month.  I would call this the ultimate Sport Utility Vehicle. 

Styling:  I think you either love it or hate it.  Personally I think it has classic timeless styling.  Only time will tell of course but with the flowing lines, the front angles and the rounded rear this car is a head turner.  

Warranty:  The car is covered under Audi's 3 year 50000 mile warranty and all service is free.

Comparisons: BMW Z3, Porsche Boxter, Mazda Miata.  

Pricing:  $30,500 and well worth it.  This vehicle has good value for what you get.  <br><br>
