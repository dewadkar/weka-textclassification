            I hold so much gratitude for this truck and it's short-lived life with us. We had it for about a year and 15k miles before my unfortunate accident. I can surely guarantee had this accident been in a car, I wouldn't be here right now. Our beloved truck was a white 1996 F150 4x4 XL, complete with a standard cab and a long bed. It came with a strong, reliable 5.8L V8 (AKA the 351 Windsor) and a 4spd automatic. With no frills, my family wasn't afraid to get this truck dirty. Really dirty.

<b>The Walk-Around</b>
The quite simple body design is tough-looking. With square headlights and rectangular tail lights, this truck definitely looks good without being eye-catching. We had a rear window guard and a plain white tool box to make this truck look and perform even more utilitarian. The 15" aluminum wheels add a sense of toughness to this truck.

The 1996 F150 was available in either regular cab or supercab configurations; with a short bed or long bed; and in either 4x2 or 4x4 drive configurations. Trim levels include XL, XLT, and Lariat.

<b>The Interior</b>
Our interior was truly spartan, having just a bench seat and no carpet on the floor. Roll-up windows and manual door locks. Perfect for those who didn't want to be afraid to track mud inside the truck. The dash sat up at a level that most trucks do. The speedometer went up to 85MPH, and there were several other gauges to keep track of the truck's vitals. No tachometer was disappointing, but it is available on XLT and Lariat trims. Our truck did come with cruise control, but that was the only creature comfort this truck had (we didn't even have cupholders!).

The bench seat is somewhat uncomfortable for long rides, but roomy enough for three adults to sit in the truck. It is also very hard to adjust, and with me and my dad switching off during long 7-hour+ trips, it was a pain in the neck.

The radio is very disappointing. The truck came with an AM/FM/Cassette stereo and four low-quality speakers. Sounded okay at lower volumes, but adjusting bass and treble levels at higher volumes caused much distortion. If you like sound quality, you will be changing out the entire stereo system.

<b>Performance</b>
Performance with this truck was about average. Having somewhere around 210 horsepower and close to 300ft/lbs of torque when stock gave this truck more than enough power in acceleration from a stop or at high speeds. The 85MPH speedometer is very misleading; this truck is more than capable of higher speeds. Passing a line of three semi's, two cars, and a truck hauling a camping trailer, we must have reached a speed of 110MPH. Unsafe I know, but we were curious. Overall, it's acceleration isn't neck-breaking, but it's no slouch.

Besides, this engine has a proven track record of reliability and toughness. We had absolutely no problems with the engine in our course of ownership, even though we really worked it hard.

Gas mileage left something to be desired, but the dual fuel tanks made it nice for long trips.

<b>The Ride</b>
We had problems with brake fade in our truck. It only happened once in a while, but it's that once in a while that counts (it contributed to my accident). When the brakes were there, stopping power was average for this truck. You needed to push the pedal significantly to effectively slow the truck.

It most definitely rode like a truck should, especially if there was no load in the back. The truck was predictable in its handling characteristics, with no wheel hop around corners. There was some looseness in the steering, but it's expected with the high mileage it had. It did, however, drive straight as an arrow.

<b>Did it perform like it should?</b>
Heck yeah, it did. If only you could see the things we did with that truck! We used this truck in some very hardcore mudding treks, and this truck is stock. Sure, we got it stuck numerous times, and we abused the heck out of it when we did. One time we had the truck so hopelessly stuck in some of the thickest swamp mud that all four tires wouldn't spin anymore, even when flooring the pedal. All you could hear is the differentials clicking and grinding away. I thought for sure that we had busted a gear or two, but once we got the truck out, it drove like it did when we bought it. We've even did a little dune-hopping in the truck, and the most air we've ever caught was about three feet for all four tires (we have it on video). No problems came up whatsoever. The truck's components were extremely tough.

We also did some long trip hauling where the truck did feel weighed down. Then again, we must have had more than 2,000lbs in the back of the truck. There was more body sway than normal, but it was expected.

And last, but definitely not least, this truck saved my life and the lives of two others riding with me. None of us had our seatbelts on when we went headlong into a utility pole and broke it in half. I, fortunately, was the driver and hit the airbag and walked away without a scratch (I had some airbag burn on my wrist though). The middle passenger hit my rear view mirror, but also walked away without a scratch. The window passenger hit the windshield, and cut up his forehead a bit. All in all, none of us needed to go the hospital. The truck and the pole were the only casulties. The truck itself was totaled, but unbelievably, the engine would still start flawlessly. If that's not tough, I don't know what is.
