            I purchased the Olympus C-3000 Zoom as an upgrade from my Olympus D-340R. I was very happy with it, but I wanted the ability to control some of my photography more and to be able to print large sized prints with little or no quality loss.

The Olympus C-3000 met both of those requirements--and then some.  One of my biggest complaints with the D-340R was lack of depth of field and no way to control it.  While the C-3000 has a program mode for the beginning amateur, it also offers a full set of controls to adjust aperature, shutter speed and focus, just like a 35MM SLR.  When shooting in the higher quality resolutions, large size prints come out looking like a 35MM quality print.  I think Olympus definitely knows what they are doing when it comes to digital!

On to features:  this little camera has plenty of them!  Not only can you take pictures in color, but you also have the ability to photograph in black and white or sepia tone as well.  The lens offers a nice range of wide-angle to telephoto and with the digital zoom you can get some nice close up shots without being on top of your subject.  The lens also has a macro setting which I've used quite a bit with very good results.  

The viewfinder is relatively easy to use and offers a diopter adjustment for users who wear glasses.  I particularly like the location of the viewfinder in relationship to the video monitor screen--no more nose prints!  The video monitor screen is about the same size as on other models, but with one major improvement--it is easy to view at just about any angle, you don't have to hold it right in front of you to get a good view of the screen.  

The buttons on the other hand are a bit confusing and will require you to carry the manual around with you for quite some time.  I've had this camera about 3 weeks and I'm just now starting to feel comfortable with where everything is and what it does.  The manual on the other hand is very poor and very basic--no real explanations as to how things work or why you should use some of the settings which I find to be a real disadvantage for the beginner or novice photographer.  However, when the camera is set in program mode, it produces very nice images, so I recommend this for someone just getting started.  I tested the program mode in several conditions--one being a shot directly at a lamp which was turned on, and the resulting photograph was perfectly exposed!

One of the neat features on this camera is the ability to film movie &quot;snippets&quot; with sound--the quality isn't what you would get with a standard video camera, but could be fun to use in situations where you only need a few seconds of video.  You can also add sound to a still picture which I think would be nice for sending e-mail photos to grandparents and relatives.  I wouldn't recommend buying this particular camera just for those features tho as they are still a bit primative, but it's a nice added feature to someone who wants a quality digital camera.

For some reason, Olympus packages this camera with two lithium battery packs that are not re-chargeable.  I think they would have been further ahead to have stuck with including rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger for them than to go this route.  Not only are the lithium batteries expensive, but I've had no luck finding anymore of them in my area and I'm back to using my rechargeables.  

The camera itself is very compact and lightweight, even with the batteries in it weights under a pound!  Another change from previous models of the same type was to add texture to the body, (as opposed to a smooth one) making it easier to grip and keep a hold of.  Might sound like a trivial thing, but when you are carrying around $800 worth of camera, it's a nice peace of mind.  

One of the biggest complaints I've heard about this camera is the lens cap--and I'm afraid that I don't agree.  I personally don't like to have my lens cap attached because when you are shooting down on to a subject, it's just another thing that might swing into the area of the lens, ruining the photograph.  The lens cap is small enough to easily fit in a pocket and if you are worried about losing it, I recommend going to your local camera store and purchasing a lens leash for it--problem solved. 

Overall I am VERY pleased with this camera--I just got back an 8 x 10 print I had made from an image shot in the highest resolution JPEG setting--and it is beautiful, very clear and the color is terrific.  I would like to stick it in with a group of 8 x 10's shot with a 35MM and see if anyone can pick out the digital image--I don't think they could.  My next test is to have an 11 x 14 printed as this is the big selling point for the 3.34 megapixel cameras--but even if it doesn't come out well, I'm still very happy with this camera.  A bit pricey right now, but I'm sure the prices will start dropping as the competition increases.
