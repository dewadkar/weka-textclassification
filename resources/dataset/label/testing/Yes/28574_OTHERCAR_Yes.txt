            It's a lot of fun, but for what they give you, it's not cheap. You have to make it worth it for yourself. If you own a Jeep, act like it. You can't expect a smooth ride or a quiet ride or to be able to take sharp turns over 20mph - even that may be too fast. 

I love mine. There's lots of +'s and -'s but to me, it's worth it. I'm 23, and I think the Wrangler appeal is aimed towards my age bracket. And it lured me in. It's what I always wanted and i'm glad I've got it, and I'm proud and other's are SO jealous... thats just an added benefit for me :)

The Jeep's body hasn't changed... If it ever did, it would not be a Jeep. the only difference is they went with square headlights for a few years. Blah. It's boxy. It looks boxy, feels boxy and rides like you're in a box, especially on windy days. It's amazing how... simple these things are to build. If you have 2 hours to spend, you could disassemble the entire vehicle. With a few exposed bolts, the windshield detaches. A few more, the doors come off. With some velcro and zippers, the top is gone. Want the back seat out? That's only too more bolts.

I went for the base model. Why have a/c when the to comes off?!? That's the question I asked myself. Well, on a hot, sunny day, when you're at a redlight for 5 minutes with the top down, you'll wish you spent the extra cash, but it's part of the experience. I also got the 4cyl. thats my BIGGEST regret. Not much pick-up, but when you're driving a Jeep, are you really looking to race someone? I'm not. 

It's very noisy, actually quieter with the top down, but in the northeast, that can't be done. The stereo doesn't have the output to cover the roadnoise all the time, unfortunately. The soundbar helps a lot, but I don't like it. The overhead section seems to cluttered. The old Jeeps had nothing but one roll bar up there. that looked better.

As far as handling goes, just remember that you're in a Jeep, don't drive like an idiot and it won't flip over. You get used to how it performs pretty quickly. It's a lot more comfortable than the older models but it still needs improvment and the back seat.... stay out of it. It's still a kidney-buster. The dashboard however is completely up to date, no more cheezy looking gauges one by one next to each other. It's better than what you'd see on M*A*S*H, that's for sure.

I haven't lost control of it and I've been able to do everything that I wanted to do with it. What gets me is that, well.. I wonder if I've been inducted into some sort of cult. If you ever drive a Jeep, I'm sure you'll notice that guys in other Jeeps will wave as you pass them. Whats up with that? I guess it's a Jeep thing. :)<br><br>
