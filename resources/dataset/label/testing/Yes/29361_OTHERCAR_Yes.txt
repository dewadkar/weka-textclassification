            With our first child coming, I was ready to trade in my 11 year-old Honda Civic and opt for a vehicle that offered more accessibility when loading a baby and all the baby stuff. 

Loyal to Honda, we checked out the CR-V '98 and I immediately fell in love on the test drive, already 7 months pregnant. The car has a great seat level for getting in and out.  The back seats are roomy and have proven to be so even with a center-mounted, full-size baby car seat. I love the simplicity of the overall design and the fact that I don't feel crammed in. There is great head room as well. It really feels like you are driving a car, only the ride is somewhat more like a small truck...a tad bumpy. 

Drawbacks! There are a few. The controls, for example. I find the button for the rear hatch very difficult to locate, still after 2 years. I find I am constantly feeling around on the left-hand panel.  The auto door lock feature by the driver side door handle should also be mirrored on the passenger side. The comparable button on the passenger side actually operates the window, which is confusing.  The window controls for the driver are on the left front dash.  The engineers could have gone for more symmetry in these areas. 

The driver must become a pro at using side mirrors when in reverse, because visibility through the four head rests is virtually non-existent. Once learned, the side mirrors are fine for maneuvering in parking lots.  The right-front roof support (only about 5 inches wide) actually creates a rather large blind spot for the driver. I have repeatedly pulled out into what I thought was a clear street, only seconds later to find a big truck barreling down on me from the right. The roof support is just wide enough (in perspective) to conceal an approaching vehicle. &quot;Holy cow...where did he come from!&quot;  It happens a little too often.  

If Honda has since fixed these kinks in its subsequent years' models, then the CR-V is a true dream car.  I plan on keeping mine for another ten years!  And since it's a Honda, I am sure I can!
