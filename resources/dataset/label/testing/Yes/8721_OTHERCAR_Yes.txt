            We purchased out Bonneville in 95.  It is a 1995 SSE.  It gives a good look at the road and spits it out the tail pipes.  The Bonneville is a unique blend between sport and luxury.  It has about 230 hp and boy it needs it to push this rather larger car (by today's standards) down the road.  It has plenty of extra power just for fun.  The leather interior is nice but, if you have children you might better get cloth.  The power seats are wonderful.  They can adjust to just about any person and their preference.  If you are not careful on trips you creep up on 80 MPH or faster.  The road is not even heard at high speeds.  I like this car although the air knob broke off after 3 years.  The car is good in the roomy dept. there is so much room there is almost an echo.  Trunk space is also good.  We havent had many problems with our car as of yet.  I do find it hard to see out of the side mirrors I think they are too small.  Our door locks and windows quit working in the back about a ear ago.  I think this is worth the money you pay for a GM semi-luxury car.<br><br>
