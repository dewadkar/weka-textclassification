            Well we had been out shopping for a new car at the time I bought my new Alero..I had test driven a number of cars and was offered a 1999 Olds Alero (Demo) to take out for a test drive..well I had wanted a new car but since this vehicle only had 21,000 kms..I decided to try it..and the price was right..only 16,000 cdn.
This is just a great car..I love it...big enough for 5 adults to ride comfortably..and the 6 cylinder has all the power you will ever need...I drive police vehicles for a living and this vehicle has more power than most of these vehicles..
I have taken it to Florida from Nova Scotia..with 2 adults and 2 children and it was a very nice riding vehicle..it come loaded with all the options you need..pw/cd player/air...it has a range of approx. 525 kms on a tank of gas..which is just great. The only thing I have found that I dislike (after 12 months) is the seat belt retractor sucks..and there is a little road noise from the front wheel drive..although I had the Pontiac Grand Am and the Trans Am out for a test drive and they are nosier than the Alero...
Take my advice this is a great car..I personally recommend it to any who ask..and when you spend 12 hrs a day in a police car..I know a good car when I see one..<br><br>
