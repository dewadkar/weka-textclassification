            My Geo Metro has proven to be an amazing car for the money I paid for it. Back in the summer of 1997 I was about to transfer to a decently far-away college, and I needed a car that was more reliable than the car I had been driving. The Metro was not my first choice actually, that was the Ford Aspire. Really, what I was looking for was something small and cheap! As fate would have it the Chevrolet dealership was first on the way to the Ford dealership, so I went there first. Obviously I never made it to the Ford place, because there sitting on the lot was a brand new Metro reduced in price because it was actually a year old. It had been sitting on the lot since '96, so I was getting a 1996 model year car in 1997, but that made no difference to me � I got a great deal. From that day on I was to be the proud (yes, proud) driver of my Geo Metro. 

The car has hardly had any problems to speak of. I believe the first time I took it back to the dealer (besides oil changes) was when I noticed a tiny rise pushing out from the hood. That was not the car's problem, it was the dealership's � they had taken the battery of my car out before I got it and put the wrong one back in. No problems here, the bump was flattened out and I got a brand new battery, which was good because the one that had been in the car had obviously been sitting on the lot for the year. 

There were no problems until the summer of 1999 when I went away for a few days and left the car behind. When I came home I found that the engine was making a clanking sound. I was still covered by the warranty so I went back to the dealer � they told me I needed a new alternator, so it was replaced and I was sent on my way with the car. The next day the sound returns � I ended up leaving my car in the shop for over two weeks. They took apart the engine, and when I finally got my car back � well, the sound was still there, but it was quieter. They couldn't figure out what it was. Nothing seemed to be out of sorts with the car, so I gave up. Over a year later the sound has diminished a lot � I hardly ever hear it, but occasionally a slight sound appears. It�s just a mystery. 

One wouldn't think that a Geo Metro could handle all I've put it though � but it has, and for the most part, with flying colors. It is flat where I live, so on a daily basis the little engine does not have to deal with hills and mountains, but that�s not to say it can't. I went to college for two years in central Pennsylvania, and it handled those hills well. I've had the car out to Pittsburgh and Elysburg PA. It's been down to West Virginia. The car has driven from the Jersey shore to Niagara Falls Ontario. I�d say while it may not be comfortable to someone sitting in the back seat, driving myself alone or with a passenger in the front, my Metro does great on the highway. I have no problem doing the speed limit (or higher), the only thing that some may find daunting is driving alongside trucks � they seem incredibly large when placed next to my tiny Metro. Still, it does well. 

Not only has my Metro driven all over the place, it's also been packed up to the roof. You�d be amazed to see the amount of books, luggage, etc you can fit inside the car. When on mountain roads, having a packed car takes a little away from the power, but those steep winding roads can be dealt with, maybe not at 65mph, but 55 works. 

The last and most important thing to mention about the Metro is the gas mileage. It's amazing � it's almost as if the older my car gets, the better the mileage. I frequently get around 50 miles per gallon � and that is even with local driving. My Metro has had a steady diet of regular unleaded fuel, and if you want to get specific, I've put Getty gasoline in most of the time. The car has a very small gas tank, so usually I go for about 250 miles (give or take, depending on what kind of driving has been done) on one tank of gas, which usually costs me $7. So a Metro won't put a dent in your wallet to keep it full of gas, and at the same time, you won�t be polluting like so many other large vehicles. 

After a three years and three months after I bought my car, it�s got under 35,000 miles on it, and it hardly seems any different than the day I brought it home. I love my car � and I am so happy that I stopped at that Chevrolet dealership instead of going straight to Ford. I plan to keep driving my car for many years to come � as many as the car will let me have � and I�m sure the car won't let me down.
