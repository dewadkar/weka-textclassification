            I bought a brand new Jeep Cherokee Classic in the summer of 1998. On Dec. 5, 1998, I totaled it. I was traveling 55 MPH when a Toyota Pickup ran a stop sign right in front of me. I slammed on the brakes and swerved left to try to avoid him, but I hit him knocking him in the ditch. I went down into another ditch, but managed to get back on the road and pull over, minus my power steering that was gone. I was surprised that I didn't roll over at the angle my Jeep was in. When I got out, the front end was gone, and the Jeep was knocked off it's block. Totaled. My husband was in the passenger seat, and my 2 kids were in the back. The kids were fine, just very scared. My husband and I both received neck and back injuries and I also have a shoulder injury. A year later, I'm still having injury problems. My airbags never deployed. The rescue team said I was better off that they didn't. I believe that if I were driving the vehicle I traded in for this jeep (1990 Chevy Lumina APV) we would have been hurt real bad. Or a possible fatality. I believed in this vehicle so much that I got a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic. I feel so safe in it just by knowing from experience how it took the blow it did. I spent 5 months looking for that first Jeep, and after the accident I didn't want to look again. So I had a local dealer do a search for me and they found the same exact one, except newer. Same beautiful black, same accessories, same quality. In short, I really love my Jeep!
