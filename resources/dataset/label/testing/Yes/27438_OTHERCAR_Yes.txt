            The Neon is a good first time buyer car.  I have a 95' Neon and 
it is ok I guess,  I mean it is a standard and has power nothing.
I would have to say the main thing I don't like about it is well
it doesn't have a tac,  and for me being a new standard driver 
it kind of sucks.  Yet if you are the kind of person(guy) who 
likes to suit up your car, well then you can go buy you one of 
those fancy tac.  This car is pretty cool all fixed up,  but it
sucks any other way.  My gas mileage isn't as good as everyone
says it is I can put $5 dollars in it in the morning and then 
I have to put $5 more dollars in that evening.  And no I don't 
drive everywhere in the book.  And as for price, well I was ripped-off.  I had a offer for almost the same car yet less 30,000 less 
miles and an automatic for the same price.  I was going to come 
and pay for it the next day because my bank was closed and 
they sold it that night to someone else.  Yet that wasn't the 
cars fault. <br><br>
