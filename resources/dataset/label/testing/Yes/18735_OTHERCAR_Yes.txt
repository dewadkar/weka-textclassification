            I recently purchased a 2001 JGC Laredo - Loaded, so it is actually more similar to the Limited than a stripped down Laredo.  The 4.7L V8 provides for a powerful yet comfortable ride.  The engine purrs at higher RPMs and the 5 speed automatic-transmission shifts very smoothly.  I've gotten quite a bit of use out of the QuadraTracII 4WD system as I live in New England and I can tell you that it handles beautifully in poor/snowy conditions.  On dry pavement, the new JGC drives as much like a luxury car as an SUV can.  If you get a decent package you can enjoy such features as the above mentioned V8, leather interior, heated seats, heated exterior mirrors, full sized spare (located very conveniently under the floor, inside the car), large sun-roof, handy overhead display, 140 watt Infinity Gold sound system, auto-dimming mirrors, towing package, fog lamps...the list goes on and on.  Yes I got all this in the Laredo for about $30K (the sticker was about $36).  I have driven a similarly priced 4Runner which felt very underpowered and sluggish compared to my jeep.  The 4Runner also handled more like a truck - and lets face it people, it doesn't look half as cool as the new Grand Cherokee.  Oh, and the suspension is excellent - there is no rolling, rocking, bouncing or anything of that sort (one reviewer was going on about how it was terrible - I have no idea how somebody could arrive at that conclusion after driving this SUV - but hey, I guess everybody's got an opinion). 

The cons, I really do not know of any yet (I will admit, I only have a few thousand miles on it).  Yes, the gas mileage isn't great, but it is an SUV, and a powerful one at that (with the V8 anyway).  My view is, if you can shell out over $35K for an SUV, an extra mile/gallon isn't gonna run you dry - and you'll have a much better driving experience.

In a nutshell - this is an incredible car - go test drive one and you'll see what I mean
