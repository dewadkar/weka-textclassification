            I first saw the newly redesigned Passat in 1998 and I was taken aback.  I had owned a beetle in the early nineties, a '76, which I loved...but the Passat never caught my eye.  While the bug was just plain cool, the Passat was an eyesore in my eyes.  Luckily for me, that all changed in '98 when the newly redesigned Passat was released.

In the Silicon Valley, class is everything.  Everyone wants to out-do everyone else and cars are a big part of that.  During the hellacious commute that we all put up with everyday, you see Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, and all the rest everywhere you look.  You become accustom to it.  But when the Passat was released, I was in awe.  Every time I looked at it, I was dumb-struck...this is just an awesome-looking car!  So classy, yet so subdued. Sleek, yet edgy.  Fast, but gentle.  I wanted one sooooo bad, but I knew I probably couldn't afford it.  Had to be in the $30's I told myself.  I didn't even want to look.

Well, that all changed in 1998 when the '92 Geo Metro I had been driving since college gave up on me.  I was stranded without a car and I figured I would just go out and buy a Honda or something.  They are suppose to be good cars, right?  Well, I start looking at all the cars and realize that no matter what I buy, I am basically going to just get a basic version, because EVERYTHING is extra.  Want windows with that car...Extra.  Finally, I decided to go to my local VW dealer and look into the Jetta (hadn't been redesigned yet).  So there I am standing there looking at this Jetta and out of the corner of my eye I can see all of these Passats...begging me to look....and so of course, I do.  Man was I amazed...95% of all the options that I would pay for in other cars, Standard!  Price...$25K!  Man...I could probably swing this!  So I did, and I have never regretted it!

THE GOOD:  The model I have gets on average about 23mpg.  I know there are HWY/CTY figures on the window, but I don't really like these...I wanna know how much on average I can expect from my car.  In this case, roughly 330 miles to the 15 (13 with 2 reserve) gallon tank.  Having said that, I have never pushed the limit..when I reach 300 miles, I refill.  You have all seen the redesigned exterior, so I won't go into that.  It's just too cool.  The inside is just as nice:  sleek black leather dash, red and blue display lights, comfortable & roomy seating, and Tiptronic (manual & automatic) gear shift.  The drive feels great also.  I have driven both Mercedes and BMW's in the past and the VW ride is close enough...for half the cash. Plus, it's so quiet...both the engine and the outside world can barely be heard.  Sometimes I can't tell if the engine started or not (can be a bit embarrasing when I try to start it a second time and get the "Starter-Grind").  In 3 years, the engine has never failed to immediately kick over.  The handling reminds me of the BMW I drove while in Germany...not sure how to put this, but I can take turns fairly fast, and the car just seems to grip the road...I have never lost control.  As far as power, I am not really a car guy, so I'm not sure what to compare it to, but lets just say I have only been out-driven once...And I am still trying to figure that one out.  I'm sure the V6 is much more powerful, but the V4 gets me closer to a speeding ticket than I would like to be...everytime I look down at my speedometer, I am doing close to 90...and I don't even feel like I'm doing more than 60...go figure.  The stock sound-system in the car rocks...again, I am a practical guy, so I will never upgrade this radio, but really, there is no need to...unless I want a cd player...because the radio rocks; crisp, clean, powerful sound.  The trunk is also one of the roomiest I have ever seen.  I could fit a cow back there!  The full spare tire is hidden under the trunk mat, while the 2/3 back seats fold down for ski's or long packages.  I just love this car!!!

THE BAD: About 2 months after I bought the car, a spring popped through the back seat(Fixed for free!)  The rubber coating on the interior door handles began to rub off after about 6 months(Replaced for free!)  The cup holders in the front are spring loaded and they broke after about 4 months(Fixed for free!)  Unfortunately, the cup-holders still block the ashtray...but I quit smoking, so it doesn't matter much anymore.  The ashtray in the back seat won't stay shut.  The spring on the front ashtray broke (fixed for free!)  The door trim on the passenger side came off...fixed for free, but came off again.  Finally I just super-glued it on.  The license plate holder on the front of the car is kinda flimsy.  It bolts onto the front bumper, which is plastic, and most screws just strip the holes and come right out of it.  Again, super-glue works wonders.

Over all, the car is the best I have ever owned.  I would definately buy it again if I had to do over again.  In fact, I'm not sure if I will ever buy anything but a VW in the future.  Although this model seems to have had a few minor issues with Quality, the most important parts (the engine, transmission, comfort, power) all work excellently and I have had no regrets for buying this car. A definate winner in my book.
