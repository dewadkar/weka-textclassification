            now, you�ve probably heard of the huge Ford Excursion: the Biggest SUV on the planet. I don�t actually own one of these vehicles, but I have test driven one and I can see why they are so popular. The ride is very smooth, not like I was expecting. It also turns on a dime. 

Being over 19 feet long, over 18,500 lbs. in weight, and 3.3 inches wider than it�s leading competitor the Chevrolet Suburban, the Excursion truly is the biggest vehicle out there with less than 18 wheels. With it�s V8 engine and 4x4 option, it�s a great vehicle for towing. You can tow 10,000 pounds with this vehicle. 

Environmentalists are complaining about the Excursions gas mileage saying that it gets 10 to 11 highway m.p.g., but that is in the worst scenario. The turbo-diesel version of the Excursion actually gets 17 to 18 m.p.g. If you ask me, that�s pretty good gas mileage for an SUV.  Also, Ford only produced 10,000 of these vehicles, so there aren�t going to be many of them around since Chevy is said to meet this challenge next year with their three-door Suburban. 

If this vehicle is so excellent, why didn�t I myself buy one? Well, the main reasons for this were 
1) Gas mileage. The Excursion that we would have purchased would have been the one that gets 10 to 11 m.p.g. on the highway. 
2) The price tag. We wheeled and dealed with our local Ford dealers and could only get them down to $40,000.00. Keep in mind we were looking to buy a Ford Excursion Limited 4x4 (the most expensive model). If you are looking into one of these vehicles I would strongly reccomend wheeling and dealing a little bit with your local dealer. Because of the price, gas mileage, and all of the bad publicity, most Ford dealerships are selling their Excursions at invoice. This is a great chance to own one of these great vehicles.
