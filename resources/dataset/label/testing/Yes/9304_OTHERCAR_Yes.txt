            This Car is suppose to be a new breed of crossover utility vehicles but unlike the nissan murano and the highlander it keeps more of a sports utility look. The look is unique and very subjective for each person. Its design has some strong lines to it and feels a bit boxy on the sides but rounded in the front and back. I personally like the look very much. Just felt like it had a more rugged look than the other crossover utilities I was considering. The ride itself is very good. Felt like a car most of the time. I still prefer the Murano's CVT (especially for the gas mileage) but that does not make a huge difference to me. The intereior of the car is also very unique. Somehow I felt like I was sitting in a big Teflon cooking pot with leather seating. The dash is unique and rather large but gets the job done. There is not much wrong with this car except just some minor things such as compartments and small extras. Also I feel awd should be standard on all limited models. Oh don't forget the kick a$$ infinity 315 watt sound system which just tears up your eardrums, very sweet indeed. If I were to get the same options that I had gotten on my endeavor on a Murano Pilot or Highlander I would have spent near 3000 to 5000 more and thats without the 2000 rebate mitsubishi is offering.  But I opted for the 0% financing which saves me even more. So over the 5 years I plan to use this car I will have saved a good 7000 to 9000 over the competition's car which did not offer 0% financing.

I had a hell alot more written than this but somehow my aol instant messenger screwed it all up and most of it got erased and only the above was posted.

This car comes with a 3.8 liter 215 horse power engine which seems a bit low for a 2ton car but with its class leading 5000 rpm its more than enough in the power department. I have no problems merging into traffic and no problems passing another car. Breaking on this vehicle is great. Breaks from 60-0 in 160 feet or so. Endeavor handles like a dream and have no problems making a sharp turn or backing up. So in the handling and power this vehicle is way up there.

The car came with some little blue lit intrument panel with no option for a navigation system which I was somewhat disappointed in. The materials used in this car seems durable and feels great, especially the leather. The cargo area stands at 76.4 cubic feet with the back seats down. Now thats not the largest in its class but its not the smallest either. Its more than enough room for me to haul around what I need to (usualy beer). Hell at one time I even loaded 18 cases of (24pack) corona in the back cargo area without even putting down the backseats. If thats not enough room then I suggest upgrading to a cargo van. The 315 watt infinity sound system is great and has no cracks or hisses even at loud volumes.

As far as safety goes the Endeavor feels sturdy and you feel very high off the ground. The limited model which I got came with side and front air bags standard but the side air bags are optional for xls and not available for ls models. I do wish it was side curtain air bags instead of just side air bags as the coverage area is much smaller with the kind that plops out of your seat. But none the less I feel mighty safe in this car and feel I can survive a good size wreck.

I feel like I made a great purchase after 3 weeks of researching and running around town looking at cars. The final selling point for me was like I stated before the price. It gives everything I want for a price I don't feel like I am being ripped off on.

Only thing I can say from here is go test drive one.
