            Our 1999 Chevy blazer has been a big hit at our house.  We tend to take a lot of long trips and carry a good bit of luggage and the Blazer has been a real work horse thus far.  It rides well, has adequate power, and has been exceeding reliable.  (This is more than some of our other recent vehicles)  

It is not however a rough and tough &quot;4 wheel drive&quot;.  It is pretty much a city car and should be purchased with that in mind.  It is also not all that roomy.  I am a little taller and bigger than the average man, but not much.  Large people may want to consider a bigger car or take up yoga.<br><br>
