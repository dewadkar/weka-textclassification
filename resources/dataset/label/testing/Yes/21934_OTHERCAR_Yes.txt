            $39,000 for a used car is a load, but after a year of driving, I think it was quite reasonable. Get into this car and you automatically put yourself in the top 2% of true road performance vehicles. On top of that, you do it in a 4-door salon car where elbows don't have to rub together. (I had a 3-series previously) Put on your Tuxedo, and you look right at home in the drivers seat. Put on your driving gloves, and flail the devil out of a Camaro on a backcountry road. There is truly nothing this car cannot do almost perfectly. I feel more comfortable at 100 mph in this car, than 75 mph in anything else I have ever driven, and you can test that theory in a very few seconds from a standing start.

Safety is first rate. The Stability control and anti-lock braking were amazing in the first snowstorm I encountered. No other 2-wheel drive car, front or rear drive, could make it up my driveway, save the BMW. Even with your foot planted to the floor, the engine will drive each wheel only as fast as the road will allow. I do not exaggerate when I say that I felt safer in my 540 than I did in my Chevy 4x4 Suburban when it came to slick streets. The car practically drives itself out of trouble in rain or shine. Dive into a sharp turn on a gravel road, and the safety systems cut your power, individually apply your brakes, and all but steer you back straight in the road. It almost makes it hard to wreck even if you WANTED TO. There are air bags all around you if something bad does happen. 

This car reminds me of a wild tiger. At rest, it is elegant. Sleek and graceful lines and muted contours cover the heart of the beast. But under the skin is the ripple of 600 pounds of nothing but muscle, claws and teeth. You feel like you can pet it, but it will eat you for lunch in 10 seconds flat if it wants to! The beauty of the BMW 540 is the fact that you can drive it CLAWS OUT, or CLAWS IN
