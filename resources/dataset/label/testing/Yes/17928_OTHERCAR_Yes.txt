<TEXT>
            I own a 1998 Avalon XL with many extras. I am a dedicated Toyota customer currently owning a 93 Camry, 93 Corolla and 98 Avalon. The Avalon offers a great ride, virtually no road noise, a great interior with a spacious back seat. The exterior integrity of the Toyota's is the best I have ever seen and the Avalon is no exception. In over two years I have had only routine maintenance as mechanical operation has been what I have come to expect from Toyota.  For my money, if you find a Toyota that suits your taste you won't find a more reliable or better riding vehicle for the money.<br><br><br>
