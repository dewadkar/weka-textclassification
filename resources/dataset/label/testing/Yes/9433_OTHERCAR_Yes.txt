            There are, as I write this, 119 other opinions about the VW Jetta. Why I would decide the world needs 120 - well, it's just a feeling I have in my bones.

I have a 1994 Jetta. If you travel around the United States, that model, much less the year, is a rarity. In Canada, we seem to have a surfeit of Jettas; you can't go a block without seeing a half-dozen of the auto-formerly-known-as-Rabbit (or, actual Rabbits and even the occasional Fox).

You need to know why we decided on the Jetta.

I had only two criteria on my list: I wanted cup holders, and for the rare occasion I was in the back seat, I wanted leg room. The former was to make up for years of driving a Jeep while holding scalding coffee between my thighs - deadly in summer, when you're wearing shorts. The latter was to allow my 6'4&quot;, 240 lb generally inactive body some room.

My wife had far more substantial list of items she wanted in a new car;  she commutes daily, so her list of 'wants-needs-must haves' was important.

Gas mileage: when tuned, the car can get between 550 and 675 km to a tank (around 330-400 miles); Comfort: the seats are comfy, recline, there is ample leg room, headroom and the dash controls are conveniently located (even of you're elfen in stature); Air conditioning: it was optional, but the value of having it FAR outweighed the cost of buying it. 

There was more, but we're getting to the homestretch of 'why' we bought the car.

Having tried perhaps a dozen similar cars, we narrowed our choice down to two: the VW Jetta, and the Mazda 626. 

Why we liked the Mazda: far more leg room in the back seat.

Why we like the Jetta: (this is critical - consider this when buying a car) the lower portion of the trunk opening was wider; the Mazda's was narrowed by the location of the tail lights. Take a large suitcase with you when looking at cars - you shouldn't have to lift it too high to get it into your trunk.

Why did we decide on the Jetta?

The trees are thick in the Muskoka region of Ontario, and in fall there is a Festival of Colours. Bus loads of tourists traverse these roads so the wonderous autumnal colours of the deciduous trees can be seen.

Near our cottage in this area, there is a country road that is very hilly. The trees over hang it, and form a dramatic archway. Once they begin to drop, driving this road of rust and red and yellow and orange creates a wake of leaves behind the car - something you have to see to feel the full impact.

And we have seen it. So...

Having traveled this road countless times, we decided that of the two cars, the Jetta was the one in which we would look the coolest driving through the tourist infested, insanely colourful areas of Cottage Country.

Of course, every car has its faults: in our 1994 Jetta, we seem to have a qwirky electrical system. It tends to go through periods where headlights burn out too quickly, the dashboard lights fail, and during super cold winters the driver's side door lock freezes.

But, given the general quality of the car, and the really cool way you look driving it in fall - I recommend the VW Jetta to anyone who wants something really nice in which to carry their coffee.
