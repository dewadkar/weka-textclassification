            The MX-700 was my first digital camera and was an excellent step in the direction of high tech photography.  I had received the camera as a gift and was intimidated at first.  I let the camera sit a while and collect dust because I was afraid to go near it.  When I finally needed to transfer some pictures over the internet, I forced myself to learn how to use the camera.  Amazingly it took all of 15 minutes to figure out how the camera functioned.  It is surprisingly easy to use.  The MX-700 is almost like a point and shoot camera.  Its little dials and buttons may seem a little scary, but if you can work your microwave or maybe even your VCR, you should have no problem.  :)  Basically, just load in some memory (in the form of SmartMedia), charge its battery, turn on, twist the dial and take pics!  It's literally that easy.  The dial and buttons are clear and obvious of their functions.  The LCD screen is a great touch and has a nice resolution of 1.5 megapixels (1,500,000 pixels).  The battery life span is average and goes down if the LCD monitor is in use.  The MX-700 is also a very compact to the point where somebody with larger hands may have trouble handling this tight package.  Overall, the camera is extremely convenient, takes nice pics and is a great launch pad for any beginner to the digital camera movement!<br><br>
