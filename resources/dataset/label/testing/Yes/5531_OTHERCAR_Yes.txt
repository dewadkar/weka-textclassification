            We had a great experience in purchasing our 2003 Denali through CarsDirect.com.  We were having difficulty finding a low miles, white, sun-roofed used Denali because a car broker friend of mine said that people are hanging onto them.  Having no success, we researched CarsDirect.com and had our new car exactly like we wanted with neither hassles nor frustration in 4 days.  

The Denali is our dream car with exceptional good looks and finish from its unique grill to its polished wheels.  The standard features are optional on other cars of its class.  The leather interior is well made, firm yet very comfortable.  Back support, height and distance can all be adjusted electronically.  We both found different but comfortable settings.  There is an "easy access" in or out setting that you can select.  It lowers the seat to get in or out automatically when you turn off the engine but we found it unnecessary and needless work on the system for our needs.  For much shorter people, it would be helpful.

When you unlock the Denali with the electronic remote, the drivers seat, gas pedal height, exterior side mirrors and entertainment center automatically adjusts to your personal settings.  Once inside, you can use the seat warmers which can isolate the seat, the back or both. It has OnStar, cell phone capabilities, Statellite stations (XM, one month free, monthly charge after), two CD Players (single player and 6 disc player), casette player, AM-FM which plays to a Bose 6 speaker system.  All can be controlled from your steering wheel.  All electronic adjustments and settings can be made from your steering wheel and door.  I am still learning all the features.  There are three-zone climate controls where, for instance, the passenger side can be isolated from the drivers and vice versa.

Besides front air bags there are side air bags as well.  There is a third row of seats where adults 5'10" or shorter can sit comfortably.  The rear cargo seats can be flattened, raised or removed.

We plan on pulling a light weight Airstream trailer.  The Denali is properly equipped to handle it with a 6.0 liter Vortec engine, transmission cooler, heavy duty ABS brakes, tow/haul selector, 7-wire harness, StabilTrac system and heavy duty towing package.  The power of the Vortec engine, 320 hp, is responsive and smooth when entering the freeway, passing and going up a grade. I drive a 2002 Crown Victoria, police special while on duty and the power of the Denali is distinctly superior.  I have a steep and lengthy grade going into town and the Denali cruises up the grade in 3rd gear, 3000 rpm, at 75 mph with no redline in sight.
The Denali smoothly passes around slower vehicles with power to spare.  Larger wheels, i.e. 22 inch rims with low profile tires could improve braking and handling but probably at the expense of a firmer ride.  It is not worth the cost and the expense of a comfortable ride.  The steering is very responsive and corners very well with no rollover feeling like we had with our Mitsubishi Montero Sport.  

The ride is comfortable and firm on the 17 inch polished wheels and tires.  I would prefer Michelins when the time comes but the handling is still really nice.  The brakes feel a little mushy because of the weight of the vehicle and mostly due to the ABS system.  It will be interesting to see when I will need to replace the pads.  Again, lower profile tires would improve braking response but the stock wheels are just fine.  

When you park the Denali, you can electronically fold the mirrors in for more access around your car in the garage.

It's just a great vehicle and worth every penny.
