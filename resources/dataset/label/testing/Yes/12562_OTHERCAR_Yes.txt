            I bought my 2002 Corvette Convertible in August as a birthday present to myself.  It is by far the best purchase I have ever made.

Before making my purchase, I test drove several 2-seater sports cars.  I drove a Porsche Boxster S, the Honda S2000, as well as a couple of BMWs.  I ended up getting the Corvette convertible in triple black, with all options save for the adjustable suspension.

The first thing that will strike you as you drive this car is the unbelievable torque.  Even if you're not so hot at gear selection with the 6-speed manual transmission, if you put your foot down, the car goes - and it goes fast.  Over the summer, I had a Boxster S come up behind me in my rearview, going at least 80 MPH while I was cruising at 60 MPH in 4th gear.  Without downshifting, I floored it and was gone before the Boxster could even think about flashing his brights at me.  A friend of mine took my car for a cruise and described the big 350 as being able to produce "ridiculous power on demand," regardless of gear selection.

Handling-wise, the Corvette excels.  I have been driving Porsches and other foreign cars noted for their handling, and I think the Corvette puts many of the Porsches to shame, considering the comparative sticker prices.  The car has an awesome active handling system that senses intended direction and will apply brakes to the appropriate wheels in order to pull the car out of a skid or to assist in cornering.  When the system engages, you know about it right away.  I ran into a situation on the 59th Street Bridge approach in New York City where I had to change lanes very quickly (right lane to left lane) and then immediately jam into the right lane again to avoid a stalled car.  After executing the turn into the right lane again, I could have sworn that the car somehow moved sideways.  The entire time, though, I felt as if the car was definitely in control.  Had I executed a similar maneuver in my old Porsche 944, I would have been part of the right-hand retaining wall.

This car holds the road very well, a testament to the active handling system and the sheer amount of rubber it puts on the road.  It comes from the factory with 17" rims in the front and 18" on the rears.  The Goodyear run-flats keep the car on the road very nicely.

Styling-wise, the Corvette looks natural with the top down.  On the Convertible, a quick 10-second operation puts the top under the "waterfall" that sweeps down from the exterior of the car to the center console.  Surprisingly, the top doesn't take away too much trunk space.  It stows under the waterfall and in the forward part of the trunk, so you can still fit two sets of golf clubs in it (with the top down) and still have a little room to spare.  I am a musician in my spare time, and I am able to put a Marshall combo amplifier and a guitar case in the trunk, even with the top down.

The polished aluminum rims are very tasteful.  I was concerned (before I saw the car) that the rims would look too "chrome-y" and would resemble something like one of the aftermarket rims that a teenager might put on his cheap Honda.  However, once I saw the rims, they looked natural on the car.

The interior looks really nice, especially the leather seats.  They are extremely comfortable and supply support in all the right places.  I took a long distance trip recently (400 miles each way) and felt comfortable the whole way there and the whole way back.  The side supports help when you're cornering really fast and help to keep you in the proper driving position.

One option you're sure to want is the HUD (Heads-Up Display).  It can project your speed, tachometer readings, fuel level, turn signal indicators and a few other critical readings on to your windshield, such that you don't have to take your eyes off the road to look at the dash.  I have found this feature incredibly useful.  It is also customizable, so you can project only the things you're interested in seeing on to the windshield.

I also love the on-board computer.  It gives you ready access to two trip indicators, your gauges, odometer and several other pieces of vital information at the touch of a button.  You can even see the tire pressure in each individual tire with a couple button presses.

If there's one thing that I could say I don't like about the car, it's the 1-4 shift thing.  Occasionally, when you start downhill or try to shift out of first gear too soon, a yellow indicator light shows on the dashboard, indicating that you should shift directly from first to fourth gear.  As I understand it, Chevy did this to get around gas guzzler laws and such.  It is kind of a pain if it catches you by surprise because you'll try to shift into second gear and will feel resistance until you shift into fourth.  Aftermarket providers sell kits that enable you to defeat this "feature," but I haven't done so.  I find that when the light comes on, I can give the car some gas and the indicator light shuts off.  It's just a matter of letting first gear run its course.

All in all, I am very happy I made my purchase.  I can't picture myself driving anything else.
