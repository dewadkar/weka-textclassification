            I bought the Ford Escort in 1999 when my long time Nissan Sentra bit the dust.  I bought a very scaled down version as my budget was tight and the last thing I wanted was a car payment. Overall, I like the car. It's very pretty and very roomy for a compact.  The only thing I don't like is that it is a little noisey, and does not have the pickup that my old Nissan had.  Given the price, I would buy it again.  I chose the slate blue and just love the color. Since I did not add features to it, other than air, I will tell you some unique fun features.  This may seem lame, but really did turn out to be important to me.  First of all, the dual cup holders are very deep and you can remove it to take inside the house to wash out.  Nice Feature!!!  Also, the ashtray is removable.  I don't smoke, so I can sit it in a back seat cup holder and use it for pocket change or whatever.  The AM/FM stereo is nice..has nice sound.  I like the fact that the back seats fold down so easily for more trunk space or to access the trunk.  I don't like that there is no trunk popper...maybe that is an option, I forget, but I don't have that option and wish I did. Other than that, I say &quot;yes&quot; to the Ford Escort if you are on a budget like me.<br><br>
