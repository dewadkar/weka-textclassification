            I bought this Sony product FD-85 a while back and I am still very happy with my purchase.  I wanted a camera that easily interfaced into any PC, so I figured the 3.5 floppy format would be great . . . I was right!

Immediately after opening the box, everything was to my liking.  The camera and components were in good shape, the battery was a breeze to charge, and the graphical interface was very user-friendly.  I had hundreds of old floppies laying around, so my data storage was nearly unlimited for photos.

Here�s what I <b>like</b> and <b>dislike</b>.

<b>LIKE</b>

1)	<i>The whole floppy thing</i> - Man, leave it to Sony to take a dead technology like floppies and turn it into something useful.  Forget the expensive memory sticks (yet also compatible with these via optional adapter), the floppies hold plenty of pictures (and they make good Frisbees).  Just cram the floppy in and click the a: drive.  It�s just that easy.
2)	<i>Lots of fun features</i> - Solarize, sharpen, black and white, high and low resolutions, macro and numerous focus options, flash control.
3)	<I>Battery life</I> - I use the camera outdoors a lot and in the cold.  When I break the camera out, I usually have about 95 minutes to go.  Not bad considering it is the stock battery and the conditions.
4)	<I>Oh yeh, the MPEG thing</I> - This is such a bonus.  The resolution options are not super, but this is a camera, not a camcorder.  You get 15 seconds of medium resolution (320x240) per floppy, and about 1 minute on low resolution (160x112), all with sound included.  Wow, what a fun option!

<b>DISLIKE</b>

1)	<I>LCD screen</I> - This display is great, but only in low light areas.  When outside during the daylight, it is really hard to see the picture on the screen.  The brightness can be adjusted, but not the contrast . . . bummer.
2)	<I>Slow recording</I> - Since the pictures record to the floppy after every exposure, there is a couple seconds of down time where another picture cannot be immediately taken.  Not good for action shots, but the MPEG mode sort of makes up for that.

I recommend this camera for the casual user who likes GREAT PICTURES with an extremely easy interface.
