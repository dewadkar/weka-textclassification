Three years ago, you would never of heard me utter the word <i>"minivan"</i> let alone talk of wanting to have one.  Nope, not me.  I was too busy looking <b>too good</b> in my Gray on Black, V8 T-bird.  =o)

My husband tried for years to talk me into getting a minivan, but I was dead set against.  I told him if he wanted to buy me a SUBURBAN, I might consider changing, but there was no way that I was going to be like every other MOMMY in the world and drive around in a funny looking minivan.  After all, there is just no way to look cool in a van, LOL!!!  =o)

Well needless to say, my mind changed. All it took was one 15 minute <b><i>"crammed"</i></b> drive home in my T-Bird after giving birth to our third son. It was at that point that I decided to give in to my husband.  I still wasn't thrilled with the idea, but knowing that we couldn't afford a Suburban <i>(at that time)</i> and that a van was the only other option for our rapidly growing family, I was willing to sacrifice for some comfort and to not have three screaming children yelling in my ear in such small quarters as my T-bird.  It was well past the time to turn in my "Bird" for a Family Car.

During our search we looked at the Plymouth Grand Voyager, the Dodge Caravan, and the Ford Windstar. Over all on exterior, interior, comfort and price, Ford Winstar won out!!! The only thing that I didn't like about the Ford was that it didn't offer the 2nd sliding door on the driver's side, which the others did. Even then,  after looking over the statistics on how it is actually safer to only have the one sliding door, I even changed my mind on that as well.

My Ford Windstar has many wonderful features in which I have grown to love.
�  Dual Airbags  <i>(Driver side and passenger side)</i>
�  Anti- Lock breaks
�  Power steering and brakes
�  Automatic door locks.  <i>(Full control to all windows on   the drivers door.  Children don't have access to control themselves.)</i>
�  Driver door safety lock system. 
�  Surround sound speaker system plus controls in the back of the van to adjust setting from back their.
�  Individual heating and air condition controls in the back seat.  <i>(But, a main control up front to turn off and on if you don't want your children messing with them.</i>
�  Back seat that sits down for more trunk room when needed.
�  Tinted windows to keep the sun out.
�  Back windshield wiper and wiper fluid dispenser.
�  Compartments on the ceiling for Change, sunglasses and a drop down mirror to watch those kiddos in the back seat.


In the two and a half in which I have owned my Ford Windstar, I have changed my mind drastically to how I feel about Minivans. I never thought I would hear myself say this but I love everything about my van! It is roomy, comfortable, reliable and able to take the daily wear and tear from my three boys.

 It has been a wonderful car that the whole family has grown to love. <i>(I have even gotten many compliments at how nice my van looks, which you don't hear too often when it comes to vans.  Maybe I can look cool????  Nah...... )</i>

As far as quality, I have not experienced any problems with my van at all.  The only time it has been in the shop was to have it serviced.  <i>(Oil changed, filter changed, tires rotated, etc...)</i>  It still drives like it did the day I drove it out of the Ford Parking lot when I first purchased it, brand new.

I would definitely recommend the Ford Windstar to anyone who is considering purchasing a minivan.  <i>(The newer models now even have the second sliding door for those who find that a necessity.)</i>  I just can't say enough good things about my Ford Windsor.
