            if it hadn't gotten hit by a cadillac in 1999 :(

I bought this car in 1989, when it was 3 years old and still in excellent condition. I had been shopping for an older car and came across this one, once I drove it, I truly believed in love at first sight.

After test driving this car, and bringing it to my mechanic, I went back to the dealership and told the salesman I wanted it, I didn't even bother to haggle, I wanted it and I wanted it yesterday. I got it.

I picked up the car the following morning and drove it home, the car handled great, it was a 5 speed transmission with red exterior and a gray interior. All electronic including a electronic sunroof. The car also had power windows, power breaks, power steering and everything else you could think of. 

The inside of the car was a bit cramped, mostly in the backseat, I still have this vision of my 6'2" neighbor scrunched into the backseat. I still wonder how we got him out. The trunk of the car was fairly roomy.

The car handled great in all sorts of weather, it was great in the rain, it never floated all over the road as alot of cars do, and also handled well in the snow. I did hesitate to drive it in the snow, only because it was low to the ground and I didn't like to take chances with it. 

I took this car on several long trip and never had any problems with it. It handled well on the highways at high speeds as well as around town.

The car lasted a long time, I never had to do any major repairs. This car was kept in excellent condition which is the reason it lasted as long as it did. 

At the time the car got hit, it had over 110,000 miles on it and was still running strong. I considered fixing it, but there was too much damage to it. If it hadn't been hit, I probably would still have it and be driving it today. 

I would recommend this car to anyone whos looking for good, reliable transportation or to use as a second car.
