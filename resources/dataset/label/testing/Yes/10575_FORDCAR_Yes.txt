            Hi All!

I've owned a 2000 Ford Ranger 4x4 XLT (with the off-road package and lots of other fun goodies) for almost 3 years now.

I really can't say I have any complaints other than minor ones.  The truck runs fine and I haven't had any serious problems at all.  And I beat on this truck something awful.  Woman driver.  I tend to hit curbs and stuff a lot.  Backed into a house with it and got a dented rear fender.  

Lately I've been hearing some strange squeaks from the rear axle so that has me concerned that something is failing back there.  But my truck has over 54,000 miles on it and hey - it may need a little tune-up back there.

Brakes work excellent.  Haven't replaced them yet (maybe that's my intermittent squeak in the rear!).  Car handles well in most conditions, it did slide out in a snow storm going up hill but I wasn't going fast and was able to regain control quite easily.   Handles well in the rain - I've never felt that the truck was out-of-control or slippy.

Engine runs fine - very smooth except at when idling, sometimes it will seem to sputter.  Apparently this is a "Ford thing" and is documented as an "issue".  And it apparently "means nothing" and isn't a "problem".  I've never noticed any strange noises or shakes in the car so I assume that it is okay.  My truck has a 4.0L V6 engine - a very wise thing b/c the truck can MOVE when it needs to.  

The 4-wheel-drive works as well, I haven't had any problems with it.  Sometimes it makes a "clunk" when it engages but the manual says that is normal.  It handles quite well in 4x4 High and can tackle most anything in 4x4 Low.

I've used this truck to travel all over creation and it has towed a car, a 21' boat, and (in multiple trips) has hauled the remains of the entire roof of my house to the dump. (we stripped my roof and re-papered/re-shingled it)  It seems to handle these tasks with ease.  It comes in very handy for Home Depot trips as well.  It works VERY WELL off-road in 2x4 and 4x4 High - the truck is definitely running its best when it is bouncing over bumpy dirt roads and mud puddles.  :)

I have the extended cab without the doors (I wish I got them) b/c stuffing stuff in the extended cab can be a pain with the sliding seats.  Sometimes the seats don't lock right and they rattle when driving.  However, the truck fits 2 adults (one 6'2") comfortably and fits all of our stuff in the extended cab when we travel.  It also fits one 92 lb. male Akita quite nicely (but not with all the stuff - that winds up in the pickup bed). :)

The stereo and cd player work fine and the A/C and heat and defogger work fine as well.  I DO notice a smell when the A/C kicks on - that moldy smell.  Another reviewer commented on this as well so that must be what I'm smelling.  However, I haven't cleaned the A/C unit or flushed it or anything, as I've noticed after a minute or two the smell goes away.  Either that or I get used to it.  

It does consume a lot of fuel - I commute 75 miles round trip a day and I have to fill the tank 2x a week.  This is not a vehicle for commuters.  

But if you want a decent truck and you are willing to pay lots of money in gas, this truck will fit your needs.  I will never be without a truck - although I am not sure whether I'd buy another Ford.  I am concerned whether the truck is going to make it to 100,000 without a serious repair.  I suppose 46,000 miles from now I'll find out.
