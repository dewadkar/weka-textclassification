            Mazda Protege5, 2003

Zoom-Zoom!

You have seen it in a television commercial; the Mazda Protege5 is the car that goes by the young boy in the commercial, which is followed by the whispering Zoom-Zoom from the boy. Well the commercial is popular enough, the question is will the Protege5 ever become as popular as some of other Mazda successes such as the Miata and the RX7. 

Will see, only time will tell.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Mazda is offered to consumers in four different trims, the base trim is the SE, than there is the ES and LX and follows the Protege5 which is a wagon like vehicle but Mazda insist that it is only a wagon like vehicle.  

The Mazda Protege5 is an interesting looking automobile from the exterior styling point of view, I am not particularly over enthusiastic about this styling but this is a personal opinion and what I do not like may please someone else.

The Mazda Protege5 has a curb weight of 2747 pounds and a wheelbase 102.7 inches. The length of the Protege5 is 174 inches and its weight is 67.1 inches. The front track of the Protege5 is at 57.7 inches and the rear wheel track is at 57.9 inches

The Mazda Protege I drove was a Protege5 trim, so the remainder of this review will concentrate mostly on that model.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As soon as I opened the driver&#146s side door, I was surprised to see what I would call an art deco styling interior. The one thing I like is that it is very clean, but with all the brushed aluminum and pewter, I also find cold. Now this is a personal preference and it does not mean that there is something wrong with the inside of the Prot�g�, actually instead of cold some may find it very cool.

Immediately after sitting behind the steering wheel, adjusting the seat and mirrors, I looked around. The driver will have an excellent all around view from inside the Protege. Even if I mentioned that I was not too thrill with the cold looking interior, I do liked the fact that the gauges are very easy to read.

The front seats felt very comfortable, Mazda writes in their brochure that they are using a Pluma-Flex board, which makes the driver seat stiffer at the bottom and more flexible at the top. Both front seats also have lumbar and lateral support. They definitely are very comfortable.

Seating arrangement can change according to your needs, the back seat can fold  (60/40) and there is enough space to carry your gears and groceries.

The Mazda Protege5 I drove had had the following standard comfort features; power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering wheels, cruise control, AM/FM radio, CD player, rear window defroster and alloy wheels.

It also had the following optional and package features: air conditioning, moonroof with air deflector, anti-theft factory installed alarm and 4-speed automatic transmission.

In the Protege5 the front head and legroom are excellent, as for the rear seat both head and legroom are at a premium.

The exterior:

The exterior styling of the Protege5 does not turn me on; again this is only a personal taste opinion because there was nothing wrong with the paint or the body of the Protege5 itself.

The cargo space is 19.8 cubic feet only; this is very little space for this type of vehicle. Extra space can be added by lowering the 60/40 rear seats.

The styling of the alloy wheels is excellent; they do fit well with the protege.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

As you probably noticed in my review, I was not overly impressed with the interior and exterior appearance of the Mazda Protege5. But as I also noted, this has nothing to do with the quality of the car, it is a personal preference in taste.

Actually the Protege5 handles real well on the highway, I would not go as far as saying zoom zoom, but it is better than broom broom.

As for driving within city limits it is excellent, you will have a good all around vision and it handles well on city streets.
