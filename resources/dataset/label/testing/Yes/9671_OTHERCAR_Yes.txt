            My boyfriend and I bought our 1997 Dodge Neon the first week that they come out on the lot.  Big mistake maybe because we ended up paying way too much for it.  I do however like a lot of things about the car.  I love the size.  It's not too big and not too small.  I don't feel as though I have to sqeeze in everywhere yet we have enough room for our daughter's car seat and two extra people in the backseat.  This car also has extremely good room height-wise.  The car also handles turns extremely well and I really like the steering.  However, we did have some problems.  For one thing there was a recall on the airbags and there was a problem with the cooling fan not turning off TWICE which was a little annoying.  I guess maybe my attachment to this car maybe mostly sentimental and I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this car unless it was really cheap.<br><br>
