            We purchased a Ford Explorer Ltd. as we had heard so much about them. We decided to purchase a Sport Utility vehicle this time instead of a car for the comfort and dependability of a 4 wheel drive vehicle. After purchasing and having the vehicle for a short period of time we knew our decision to change from a car to a Sport Utility vehicle was the best thing for us.
 
We really love the leather interior, the climate control, the compass and temperature feature and the way it handles on the road. The only thing my husband does not like about the the Ford Explorer is for him there is not quite enough leg room when he is driving. For myself it is fine. We love the way the vehicle handles and the ease of changing to 4-wheel drive.
 
We recommend this vehicle to anyone who is contemplating purchasing a Sport Utility vehicle or needs room for a growing family. If you are looking for a vehicle that is great on fuel consumption then you may want to think twice. We do average approximately 15.9 miles to the gallon. We love our Ford Explorer and would purchase this vehicle again when we should decide to buy.<br><br>
