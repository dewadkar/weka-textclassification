            The Subaru wagon, one of the most popular cars in my hometown is an automobile many Connecticut citizens rely on. Available in almost any exterior finish, the Subaru is a great midsize wagon that gets excellent gas mileage, has unbeatable kick, and is priced and packed for under 19,000 dollars. This car has 60/40 folding seats, will easily fit any large load, skis, or even an upright bass for that matter. No doubt about it, the car will get you and your needs where you need to go.
    However, the car does have some downfalls. The handling on this vehicle is not up to par. In comparison with other wagons of it's class, the toyota wagon, or ford, the subaru lucks out. Also, for the more expensive buyers, the leather interior and the cd player have no match to the luxurious taurus wagon. The space is nice in the car, yet the dimensions are not as wide as the two other leading competitors.
   I personally think this car would be great for high-school kids, or college students that need to carry a load wherever they go. The car is relliable, and has that Subaru name that many townspeople trust.
