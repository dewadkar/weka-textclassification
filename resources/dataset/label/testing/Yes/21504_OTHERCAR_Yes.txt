            This is a terrific car in almost every area, so the few minor negatives are easy to overlook. It's been one of the most popular cars in Europe for two decades and I've never understood why U.S. buyers have ignored it in favor of ugly, inefficient, or more expensive cars. In fact, the Golf is just about the only 4-door hatchback sold in the U.S. that is not an SUV or minivan.

I have always been a loyal Honda owner, but got frustrated by Honda's lack of a 4-door hatchback, and the tiny trunk in the sedan. VW's new Golf has tons of features, ABS, side airbags, nice sound system, and an interior that has a quality look and feel that makes it seem like a much more expensive car. I'm certainly no professional driver, but the Golf handles nimbly and solidly - much more &quot;German&quot; than my old Hondas. I feel much more secure on the road, in any weather. I wouldn't exactly call it a sports car (though you could get the 6 cylinder version), but for normal driving it accelerates fine for me and is great fun to drive. The cargo space is gigantic for a car this size. I can easily fit 10-12 full bags of groceries in the trunk without putting the seat down. With the back seat down flat you can stuff huge pieces of furniture in the back if you need to. It has easily as much cargo room as the smaller SUVs I've seen.

The Golf is definitely a car for small people, which I am. I'm sure tall or wide people would feel cramped, but for a subcompact it's as roomy and comfortable as anything I tried. The seats are firm but comfy, and I've gone around 5 hours in them without feeling too bad. I have only two minor gripes: First, the visibility is not so great. Not bad either, but I was spoiled by my Civic. (Then again, here in Boston, nobody actually looks for other cars anyway.) Second, the mileage is good but not good enough for a car this size. I get around 28-30 in mixed driving. I hope VW is planning to bring hybrid technology to their lineup soon. If my Golf could get 50 mpg I'd think I'd died and gone to heaven. 

I was a little worried about reliability since the previous generations of Golf had a history of problems, but the new version seems to be doing well from what I've read, and I've had no problems at all so far, at least in the first year.

I'd highly recommend the Golf to anyone looking for a small car that drives great, feels great, looks hip, and has tons of room. Americans seem to be flocking to the Jetta in droves because of their propensity for sports sedans, but if you want a sporty subcompact that doubles as practical, get a Golf. You'll love it. Given that it's not a big seller for VW in the U.S. the dealers should be willing to give you more wiggle-room in price negotiations. 

Oh, and the dashboard lights are *so* cool.<br><br>
