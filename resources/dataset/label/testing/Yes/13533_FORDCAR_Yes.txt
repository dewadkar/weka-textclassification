            I can honestly say, after purchasing this car, I don't know how I ever lived without it.  I can not say enough good things about this car, in the sense that it gives me everything I could ever want in a car, plus the little extras that are always nice to get when making a large purchase.  For the regular outdoors men or for the average soccer mom hauling kids from game to game, this is the car for you.

The spacious room is unbelievible.  When you go from a little Toyota to a Explorer like I did, you feel like you're in your apartment.  The comfort level is excellent, and also for a large vechicle it handles the road very well while giving you a smooth ride.  Ford is a realible company and is definatly worth the money if you are looking into a sports utility vechicle for yourself.

The lone down side is the gas/mile ratio.  This car is a &quot;gas guzzler&quot;.  If you plan of driving long distances or driving extremly fast, better be prepared to make a few pit-stops along the way.

Overall, best car I have ever had and plan on keep it.<br><br>
