            I have owned this car since 1994 and I have almost a 120 thousand miles on it at the time of this review. I will say that it will hopefully be the last car I own for the next 10 years. I just love driving it. It is smooth, powerful, with just a hint of understeer that make it a blast to drive. Mileage is around 16 ish not bad for a 12 cylinder car. Top speed is 155 mph with z rated tires. I chose to put lower speed tires (which have a longer life) I did this due to the fact that I never go 155 mph or anywhere close so sr rated tires are fine for me. Maintenance has been fairly simple and not horribly expensive. Usually around two to three hundred a year. The sound system is great and the ride is very quiet. The back seats recline and are heated to boot. The kids love to ride in the back. In fact it is one of their favorites to do is play with all the buttons back there.

Trunk room is spacious and the gas tank holds about 26 gallons.
But the real draw is under the hood. Those twelve cylinders really separate the wheat from the chaff. It is like have a turbine under the hood the power just builds and builds with an effortless grace. Many a Porsche has seen my tail lights due to that engine. I cannot begin to tell you the looks on the hotrodders faces when I pop the hood on a gleaming aluminum overhead cam twelve cylinder. This is a supercar motor in a four door sedan. All in all, it is a blast to drive and a treat to own.<br><br>
