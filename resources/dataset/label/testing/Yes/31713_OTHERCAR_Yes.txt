            Of all the vehicles I've rented, test driven, or borrowed over the last couple of years, the 2000 Dodge Intrepid ES was the only one I wanted to keep. (besides my own Grad Prix...)

<b>A glorious week</b>
On my trips, my company specifies &quot;mid-size&quot;. Most companies provide the Ford Contour. Ick. I took the $8 upgrade to the Dodge Intrepid. Best money I've ever spent. The first thing I noticed was how cool this car looks. The cab forward design, and the large aluminum wheels give the car a very aerodynamic raked appearance.... which is very sporty for a larger car. 

<b>Impressions</b>
The seats are very large and very comfortable. The seat controls are easy to use. The trunk has a very high lid allowing you to put a whole families worth of luggage in (plus the whole family too!) with some space to spare. The doors are large and easy to get in and out of, but it makes the car a little harder to park- leave plenty of room. The windows, especially the raked windshield, provide a great view. One thing I did notice was a slight distortion at some points, but it depended on the angle of the sun. All the controls were very easy to use. Getting accustomed to how to use everything only took about ten minutes. 

<b>Driving</b> 
O what fun! The Intrepid's 205HP V6 power plant makes very little noise but plenty of GO! The wide stance and long wheel base make this a very stable car with plenty of pickup. Couple that with the great view of the road and the excellent sound system and this Intrepid is ... almost as fun to drive as my car... (very tough to say- and don't tell my car I said so)

<b>What else is there?</b>
Who should buy? Well if you are considering a minivan consider this; 
Two of my sisters have Intrepids and their's have the same size doors, which makes unloading children and toys very easy. The large trunks also can hold a massive amount of groceries or other child associated things. That gives you a safe car that's fun to drive and can comfortably handle your responsibilities. Without the embarassment of driving a minivan. You should also put the Intrepid on your list if you just enjoy the driving. My rental did not have all the options, but I still had a great time driving it. 
Both of my sister's Intrepids had early teething troubles, but these were early models. I would recommend checking reputable auto sources for repair histories, but otherwise the Intrepid gets a strong thumb's up.    <br><br>
