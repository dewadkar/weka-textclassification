            I originally purchased the 2020-Z based on professional trials and am very satisfied with this camera.  It is easy to hold due to the ergonomics and all of the controls are placed for ease of use.  One of the features that is head and shoulders above the competition is the ability to shoot in color (with extremely high  resolution), black and white or sepia tone.  Thus it allows the camera to be more of an artists palette than just a point and shoot medium zoom camera.  I am using the floppy disk adapter for downloads to the computer and that allows for very fast screen images versus the standard download methods.  

There are two things that I feel they should do to improve this camera:
(1)  Set-up the camera to download thru a USB port on the computer which would save the expenditure necessary to purchase a floppy adapter.  The serial port download is much too slow,especially if you are doing it on battery power.
(2)  The battery charger (uses Nickel Hydride batteries for best results) could also double as an ac adapter to save battery power when downloading to the computer or the television.<br><br>
