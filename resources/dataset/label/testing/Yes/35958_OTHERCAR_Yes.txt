            I recently purchased a Honda Civic.  I bought the car because it had everything I wanted and it was perfect for my budget.  There are different versions of the Civic, so I can just speak of the one that I have.  The Civic gives both Comfort and Convenience.  It offers a heating and cooling system, audio system, keyless entry, cruise control and many other features.  A couple of the safety features the Civic has are the airbag and the ABS(Anti-lock system)brakes.  The Civic  runs smoothly and is &quot;good&quot; on gas.  I think the Civic is good for college students or those who are single or who have a very small family. I definitely would not recommend anyone with a family larger than four to purchase a Civic as their primary or family car.  I love everything about my Civic and I do strongly believe you will too. <br><br>
