            My husband owned a black 1987 Pulsar when we first started dating (in 1996) and we ended up keeping it two years after that, and then gave it to someone in the family, and it is still going strong. My husband didn't have to do hardly any work to it, except for replacing an upper radiator hose and an alternator. At one point, he was even delivering pizza with it, so it withstood a good deal of use and abuse. It even survived three wrecks, had the fender and hood replaced as a result, and looks none the worse for wear.

Of all the cars we've owned, the little Pulsar had to have been the one that gave us the least trouble. I remember it used to purr like a kitten, and was a smooth, quiet ride. As it was a standard and ran on four cylinders, it gave us excellent gas mileage, from 28-30 miles per gallon on average. On the outside, it was sleek and stylish, a sports car first and foremost. On the inside, however, the design was practical, modern, and comfortable, even if a snug fit.

Our Pulsar had over 140,000 miles on it when we passed it on, and as far as we've heard there have been no problems with it since. It was a sporty little car, with t-tops to boot. It was the first standard (a five speed) that I learned to drive and will always hold a special place in my heart. I enjoyed driving it as it was small and would &quot;scoot&quot;, and handled very well. I always thought it was a fun car, and it could always be depended upon to get you from A to B. 

The only drawback is that it does not make a good family car. Room is not one of its better features. The two doors make climbing in and out of the backseat a formidable task. The backseat itself is practically nonexistent, although it is there, and can fold down to allow more room for the trunk.. The bucket seats up front were comfortable enough, but you fit snugly into them. 

It makes a good &quot;sporty&quot; car for a single person or a couple without kids. However, when my son came along, we knew it was time to think about getting a roomier automobile. Believe it or not, I always managed to fit my groceries into it just fine. The trunk space is actually roomy and the hatchback-type opening in the back allows for easy access.

My husband informed me that they no longer make Pulsars, so if you want one, you'll have to keep your eyes open for a good deal. I see lots of them out on the road, so don't let the small size fool you-they can keep up with the bigger 'mobiles. It's not quite a convertible, but equally gratifying.
