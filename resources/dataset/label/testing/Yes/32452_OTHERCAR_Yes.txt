                <b>U</b>sing the Porsche 944 Turbo as it's main target, Japanese giant 'Nissan' set out on a mission to transform the image of its sporty yet dated 300ZX; a task in which it succeeded. The last models were (1990-1996) one of the fastest and best handling sports cars of its day!


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
  
  <b>Acceleration</b> form a full stop is excellent! Compared to cars like the Mustang GT and Camaro Z28 TPI, the 300ZX was more of a refined demeanor about its off-the-line acceleration. Mated with the 5-speed, this car can burn rubber almost through 3rd gear, and does so without making the driver feel like he or she is going to lose control. 

<b>Handling</b> is awesome, and is one of this car's strongest attributes.  The steering, the braking, the wide tires, all make for an experience you will never want to forget. Hills can be taken in any gear, this car has enough power to take any hill without fuss. <b>Cruising</b> is excellent, the ride is not too hard, yet not too soft. Bumps, road, and engine noise are isolated from the driver giving occupants a hushed environment.

The <b>suspension</b> sets the Nissan apart from the other Twin Turbo cars, such as the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4. With the help of two huge cray supercomputers, double wishbone suspension was developed to complement the four wheel steering system which comes into operation at high speeds. Such precise suspension also required an extremely stiff body shell.

 <b>About the engine:</b> Nissan spared us no technical trick with the iron block-alloy head 3.0 liter DOHC V6. There's four overhead cams, and 24 valves of course, but also <b>variable valve timing</b>, that's right, Honda was not the first company to come out with VVT! The 3.0 also featured direct ignition with separate coil for each spark plug. Two hybrid Garett T2/T25 turbochargers are used, one for each bank of cylinders blowing through twin air to air intercoolers. For engine tuning, the induction pipes from each turbo are very long, each running across the engine.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
      
The <b>interior</b> of the 1990 Nissan 300ZX is simply awesome! Supportive black leather seats offering plenty of bolstering, a 'super cool' leather wrapped steering wheel, power everything, etc. The cockpit is so refined you could not tell the difference from the interior of this early '90s sports car to the interior of a sports car for 2002, perhaps the 1990 300ZX's interior looks even more modern compared to many of these 2002-2003 models. One thing I adore about the 300ZX is the quality of the materials used throughout the cabin. While cars like the Mustang/Camaro were using cheap plastics for this year, the 300ZX's interior was all about quality.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
           
The <b>exterior</b> is very good looking. Very handsome, sleek and sporty at any angle. The 300ZX for 1990 had to be one of the best looking cars on the road under 50K. Even for the 2002 model year the 1990 300ZX looks relatively fresh, not giving other drivers a hint to how old the design is.

<i>Pricing:</i> 
   
The <b>price</b> is right for this car, they are going for less than $15,000 in some cases! Even if you can grab a non turbo model it's worth it. These cars are sure to be future to be classics, if not already.
