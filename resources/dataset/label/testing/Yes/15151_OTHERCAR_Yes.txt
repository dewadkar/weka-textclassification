            The 1996 Pontiac Grand Am was purchased new due to its styling and the V-6 power.  However, the automobile shortly after delivery developed problems.

The problems started small and were easily corrected by the dealer.  Such a problem was serious wind noise from the rear window.  Next was the altenator being replaced.

Soon the major problem started after fifty thousand miles.  The check engine light kept coming on.  The dealers machine indicated it was related to the transmission, but when driven by the mechanic, no adverse condition was found.  This went on for several months until the Service Manager did drive the car and the transmission did slip.  The Service Manager did order a new transmission, but had to get authorization from Pontiac.  The transmission was replaced, but I was not compensated for the lost time from work and the time just setting at the dealer waiting for the auto to be serviced.

Unfortunately to Pontiac, I will look to another manufacturer when I plan to purchase a new car in the coming year.  <br><br>
