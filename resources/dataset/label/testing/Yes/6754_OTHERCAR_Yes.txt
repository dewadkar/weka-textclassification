            I never have like Hyundai. My parents went out and bought thier 3rd brand new vehicle and with me leaving the house for my basic training in the army, they could afford to go out and buy a sports car, they bought a tiburon. Now when I came back 3 months later and saw this coupe I began to wonder what the heck the Honda designers were smoking. I commented to my dad that I liked his little Honda and he quickly corrested me. "Its a Huyndai.", he says to me. Well with the army paying me, I figured it was well time I bought my first vehicle and had my father take me out.

The First place we stopped was a Hyundai dealer. I wandered through the lanes of cars Accents were to small, Elantra didnt have an armrest, Sonata's looks made me run away, Tiburon would kill me on insurance (I'm only 19 so Insurance is a rather large factor), and the XG300 was to exspensive. I thought Hyundai was now out of the picture when my dad litterally dragged me over to behind the building where the Santa Fe was hidden. I guess it was love at first sight. At least for me.

The Santa Fe caught my eye namely because it didnt look like a run-of-the-mill SUV. It was more rounded, with large plastic bumpers front and back. Most of my freinds like it, but some think its treally strange looking. Inside was more attractive, some plastic materials stretched out for acres but they look like thier of good quality. A very good stereo, power everything. The only thing it lacked was no air conditioning, but I will have to do without. The most important feature was the <B>Shiftronic</B> Transmission. It allows you to drive the car like a standard and manually change gears, just without the hassle of the clutch. The best of both worlds. 

The engine and transmission seem to work well expecially in the Toronto area where the speed limit is unnofically about 150k/ph (90 mph) where having the ability to downshift and use the 180 horsepower from its 2.7 L V6 to rip past slower cars make this fun. Light off-roading is also good, but watch out for tree stumps over 12". (I hit one with minimal damage to the skidplates.) Off and on road the suspension is superb. Simply Super. You really dont feel things on the road such as stones, cracks, curbs (ok, im not the best driver :-)).

I dont really care for the power window controls, they are wierd looking but not hard to use. I suppose I will just have to get used to them. 

I belive that just about anyone can get use out of the Santa Fe, unless you have said "oops" more then 3 times and had lots of darling little children because of it. :) My main concern was my mother complained she had little visibility in it, she is barely 5 feet tall and claims she couldnt see over the dash. Im not sure, Im 6 feet tall and have no problems.

I guess the final push for me buying this truck was the fact that Hyundai offers unsurpassed lease rates. I pay $450 CDN for mine, including 15% sales tax. I didnt appriciate that Hyundai has yet to bring its Long Haul Warranty to Canada, so I feel kind of ripped off. I also Didnt appriciate the conditions of the lease, having to put a months payement and security, which came up to $900 bucks up front. But Thats the price you pay and in comparison to Ford's "Red Carpet Lease" Im still saving $200 a month on the lease.

Overall Im really impressed with both the Tiburon and the Santa Fe! They are still going strong after many months and have caused us no grief as of yet. Im still wary due to Hyundai's past track records but only time will proove they have gotten better in some people's minds. I can tell you one thing. They really have come up in the world since the Excel.

Well it like Hyundai says - Driving Is Believing.

Well, the truck is no longer exsistant. Yeah I had an accident with it on the highway.

What happened? Traveling at 100k/ph I was t-boned by a ford taurus. The truck slid sideways and its airbags went off right before it rolled over - twice. The side airbags really saved my rear as my girlfreind told me that my head hit it. It then slid another 100 feet before it came off its roof and stopped on its driver side. I was stunned and me and my girlfriend hopped out of the side door UNSCATHED. It was kind of like in a movie where the hero hops out of the wretcked vehicle through the other door. The taurus' front end was completly torn off the vehicle and you could see where the santa fe hit.

The truck had massive damage, mostly to its body but the cabin looked like it was just bought, apart from 6 airbags hanging out and airbag dust all over. 

So we waited for police but the most hilarious part was that they started the truck up and drove it onto the flatbed. In my opinion if it was not for the side airbag, I would probably be a vegtable, so check in hand, I now hunt for a new vehicle. 

Thank you Hyundai for saving my rear end.
