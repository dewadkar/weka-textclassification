            When my wife and I finally accepted that our old 4WD minivan was on its last few miles, we decided to explore the world of SUVs. After test driving everything from a Jeep Wrangler to a Chevy Suburban, we were dismayed at their lack of comfort, economy and practicality. We then looked at 4WD sedans, but found them to be too small, inconvenient and expensive.

We finally stopped by our local Lexus dealer and examined the RX-300. We could not believe that I was driving an AWD vehicle. The level of comfort was extraordinary, and the fit and finish was worthy of the Lexus moniker. It rode and handled much like a luxury sedan and accelerated more powerfully and smoothly than any other SUV we had tested. We put in our order that very day and have enjoyed our vehicle for over a year.

The standard sound system, with it's 6 CD changer is powerful and easy to operate. With an efficient climate control system (which includes seat warmers) and adjustable power seats (with two position memory), it is easy to get very comfortable in the RX.

Three full sized adults fit easily in the back, while still maintaining ample storage space behind. The luggage rack on the roof allows for additional baggage and skis.

To our surprise, the gas mileage has been comparable to our sedan (a Camry). Since Lexus provides for free routine maintenance (including free loaners), keeping the buggy in tip-top shape has been a breeze.

What do I dislike? Not too much, really. I even like the &quot;busy&quot; display of which some other reviewers complain. There is plenty of useful information to be found there once you get accustomed to it. The turning radius is larger than I would like, and on occasion I do have a need to seat more than five passengers.

My experience with the RX-300 has been positive. Whether in the heavy Midwest snow of last winter, or cruising the streets of a modern metropolis, our RX is comfortable, competent and confident. 

In summary, Lexus has done a clever job of blending a comfortable sedan with a useful SUV. The resulting hybrid is the remarkable RX-300.<br><br>
