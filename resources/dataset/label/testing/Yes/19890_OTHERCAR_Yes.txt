            I was not really in the market of looking for a digital camera as I already own a JVC 500 digital camcorder/camera.  Yet, when I received the HP camera for christmas I was impressed so much that I put my other camera up for auction on Ebay.

This camera is in the cheaper end of quality cameras and is only about 2 mega pixels or so in sharpness but do not let such things fool you!!!

this camera has it all, easy transfer of pictures to email, one touch printing, and a digital zoom for when the standard 3x is just not enough.  

the camera comes included with USB & firewire cables, something that is found less and less in computing products these days, this saves you a good thirty to sixty dollars in quality cables.

the camera have a 16 MB built in memory to store pictures but also has a slot for SD cards up to 500 MB.  

Picture quality is well above average.  In addition to great pictures you can also add audio to the pics AND there is also a video capture.
The pictures you take have many settings for various lighting, in addition to the flash on the camera you also have a red eye reduction and much more!

Of course, there is a slight downside to using this camera.  BATTERIES are a slight problem here.  this unit consumes batteries like a thirsty man in the desert!  There is a good remedy though, you can purchase a rayovac quick charger for AA batteries and charge your batteries in just fifteen minutes.  These special batteries also last longer than standard batteries so you can relax with that problem solved (for only twenty dollars).  

There is no docking station that can be sold as an extra for this model of camera but it comes with an adaptor to fit the docking station intended for a higher model.  With the battery charger and the firewire and usb cables that come with the camera though, you have no real need for one!
