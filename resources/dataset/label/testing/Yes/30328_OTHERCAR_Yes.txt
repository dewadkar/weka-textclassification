            I have always been a thrifty person. Over 24 years of driving, I have only owned six cars, and when I buy a new car I expect to keep it for ten years. My first new car was a 1990 Acura Legend Coupe. So far it has been the most durable car I have ever owned. I wouldn't say that the dealerships' service department or the Honda/Acura corporation is nearly as good as the car they produced. I had mediocre support from the dealerships generally, and there was once situation where the rotors wore out so quickly that I had to write a few letters to the manufacturer to get things resolved. But over a nine year ownership period and 180,000 miles (no typo), the only things that ever went wrong with my Legend besides the rotors was the master cylinder needing replacement once, the retracting radio antennae wearing out (I never fixed it), a plastic strip from the moonroof fell off (never replaced it and never missed having it) and that black-painted headliner (the metal strip above the windshield) started flaking-off some of the black paint. Other than the above, all I paid for was tires, gasoline, oil changes - the usual stuff. I did have a couple of expensive brake jobs due to the way I drove this car (high speeds followed by heavy braking). I traded in the Legend just before my second timing-belt needed replacement, and this was the only expensive maintenance item ($1000 I think - it was about 5 years ago when I had it replaced after 90,000 miles). The engine felt as strong as it did when it was new and probably had another 100,000 miles in it before any major engine rework was needed. The ride was always very quiet - until my drivers side window was broken into and replaced with another window that did nto fit as well. But I really drove this car hard and got my money's worth - I hope I have such good luck with the car I traded it in towards - a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.<br><br>
