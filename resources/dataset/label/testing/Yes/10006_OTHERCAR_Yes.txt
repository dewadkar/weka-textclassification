            I bought a Sephia in May, for Mothers Day, for my wife.  It wasn't a hard choice at all.  All I did was find the color she liked and decided which of three packages I thought she would enjoy the most.

It wasn't a hard choice for the simple fact that we have 5 more in our extended family.  The first was purchased by a cousin in 1994.  I had seen the great ads for it, but didn't know if I trusted them, being a new company and all.  I had worked in car dealerships for several years in my late teens and early twenties, and felt I had a good set of criteria for REALLY testing a car when I drove it.  She let me drive it, and not only was I impressed, but amazed!

When I hear a new company coming up, especially charging for the cars what Kia does, I can't help but assume that the corners they cut are quality amenities, comfort of driving, and vehicle performance.  I was, and still am, always impressed that these vehicles are put together solidly, with comfort in mind, and they perform quite well.  The only thing I don't like about the Sephia is the gear ratio.  I am pretty assertive driver, I like a car to respond immediately for an increase in speed.  I drive a maxed out police car 40-50 hours a week, and have always had sport cars, so I am accustomed to that style.  For my wife, who is actually quite a timid driver, she loves it and has no complaints.

My wife spends about two hours a day in it, driving back and forth to work.  If she fills the tank when the light comes on, it takes about $16.  But then she gets anywhere from 300-400 miles out of it.  It rides quietly and smoothly, and all the power parts - windows, locks, steering and brakes - are set to comfortable levels.  She is even happy that she doesn't have to pull the seat all the way forward and can still see out of the vehicle, she is only 5ft!

Since that first Kia experience, I bought a Kia Sportage1996, my mother bought a Sephia in 1997, my grandmother bought a Sephia in 1998, and then I bought another Sephia, for my wife.  All of these cars have never broken down.  Except for my 2000 Sephia, we have never had a major repair, and have never had to do anything but normal maintenance.  My Sportage has been hit 3 times by others, and it still works perfectly.  I still drive it today, and will never trade it in.

My 2000 Sephia, much to the chagrin of the dealer had a problem in the transmission right at the beginning.  A light kept coming on that the transmission wasn't in overdrive.  The car ran fine, so I knew that it had to be a switch somewhere.  They had the car for the first three weeks of owning it, checking every possible switch, the electronic cables and devices, and finally just decided to a put a whole new transmission in it.  I was glad that this was done at the very beginning, so the transmission and engine could break in together, and they were grateful to have this happen to an already faithful Kia owner.  Since the fix we have had no problems.

I recommend to everyone buy a Kia.  There will always be that one that turns out to be a headache, but so far we are 5-5, which is more than I can say about any other vehicle I have owned.
