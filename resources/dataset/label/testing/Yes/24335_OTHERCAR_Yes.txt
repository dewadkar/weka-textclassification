            Could lightning strike twice for me?  As the past owner of a '92 Dodge Dakota Club Cab with 204,000 miles on it, I was hoping so.  Had it not been for an untimely auto accident I would still be driving that truck.  But, alas,  it was time to replace that vehicle and the Dakota Club Cab seemed perfect.  As my daily work vehicle it was spacious inside, with room for all my work related equipment, yet smaller than the full size pickups which are difficult to park in urban areas where parking space is at a premium.  I am also a frequent camper and the truck works well for that.  Lot's of room fore and aft for gear, food, and people.
This new pickup has the 4.7L V-8 and boy does it get up and go!  Great power and almost the same gas mileage as my old V-6 model on average.  The four-speed automatic works well with crisp shifts and effortless passing at any speed.  Handling is very good and wait till you get a look at the size of that sway bar up front.  Massive!  With no load handling can be a bit stiff.  I am averaging 18 MPG with almost 50/50 city and highway driving.  The on-board computer may be partially to thank for the mileage as I find myself driving to maximize fuel economy.  The newer, Ram-inspired body style, gets me looks the older model didn't.  I had the optional 15 X 8 wheels and 255/65 15&quot; Goodyear tires and they perform well.  I ended up purchasing the factory fender flares later, though, as the tires stuck out about an inch past the fender wells and the flares keep the truck cleaner.  
The bucket seats are a bit of a disappointment as they seem cheaper and less supportive than the ones in my '92.  Lot's of adjustments on the 6-way power seating, however.  I love the rear seats compared to the ones offered in the Chevy S-10 and Ford Ranger.  Comparatively roomy and forward facing with storage compartments underneath. First vehicle I have ever bought new that didn't have to go back to the dealership for ANYTHING!!!  Buy it and don't look back!<br><br>
