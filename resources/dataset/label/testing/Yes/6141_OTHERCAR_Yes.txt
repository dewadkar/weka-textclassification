            Every 4 years I get to choose a new company car: must be 4 drs 6 cyl midsize or larger and domestic.  My allowance is $23425 plus tax and tags.
I looked carefully at Olds Intrigue Chevy Impala and Dodge Intrepid and also drove the new Taurus and Sable.
The Impala is a decent sized car with a smooth and powerful drivetrain...It reminds just how far cars have come since the rotten 
'70's.  I concentrated on the LS although some dealers have been ordering base models and building them up with the 3.8 engine(which gets you most of the LS engineering goodies but eliminates things like the stupid spoiler.   The car goes and stops well and if the dealer will let you actually drive it,(most seem to want you to do little-old-man-around-the- block tours) you will be impressed. Problem is the interior- while the seats in front feel comfortable the leather seats look low end plus the dash is best described as 'chaotic'- Trunk's big but not overwhelming. After reading reviews on the car, somewhat disappointed and just not the car for me- so I bought an Intrepid. In a year or two when GM gets the interior sorted out and polishes this car a bit I suspect it will be a very good car-and ps- GM, why don't you folks make it into the last american full size station wagon?<br><br>
