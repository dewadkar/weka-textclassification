            A couple of months ago, I purchased a 1998 Chevy S-10 four cylinder five speed pick up truck.  I was looking for a reasonably priced vehicle without a lot of bells and whistles.  In our area of Illinois, they are all over the used car lots.  Many are corporate fleet trucks.  This was a replacement for my 1990 Nissan pick up.  That is definitely a hard act to follow.  That vehicle ran for over 150,000 miles with little or no maintenance.  But, this review is about the S-10.  

So far so good!  I like it.  The body style is attractive.  Bumpers are adequate.  The truck bed is large enough for small loads.  Mine came with a bed liner.  This is the first vehicle I have owned with a bed liner.  It is definitely a plus. The tint on the rear window is pretty dark.  It is a little hard to see out of when backing at night.  But, I don't know if the tint is standard on a new vehicle.  The center arm rest, change holder, cassette holder combination is great.  But, there is only one cup holder.  There are two outlets for cell phones or other use.  The seats are very comfortable with good back support.  I am six foot one inches tall.  Leg room and head room is good for this type of vehicle.  Otherwise, the interior is somewhat small, but very adequate.

The engine has sufficient power, thanks to the light weight of the vehicle.  It will get up and go.  However, it does whine a little at speeds over sixty miles per hour.  I have driven this vehicle in the rain and light snow.  It sort of bobs and weaves on wet pavement.  I am a little worried about the reaction of this truck to our Midwest winters.  The transmission shifts satisfactory with the exception of third gear.  It sticks slightly.  But, again I did not buy this vehicle new.  The ride is a typical small truck ride.  

While I cannot make a judgment on the engine reliability, everything else about the 1998 S-10 seems more than average. I hope it proves to be a match for my old 1990 Nissan pick up.  I am pretty satisfied at the moment.  I hope I do not have to revisit this review at a later date.

As of the moment, it has my recommendation.
