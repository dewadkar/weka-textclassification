            My husband has a 1994 Dodge Ram 4 wheel drive pickup with a Cummins diesel engine. He loves this truck so much that he's been wanting to trade for three years, but he looks at the new ones, finds a couple he likes, starts to deal on them, then decides he's just not ready to give this one up yet. He has over 140,000 miles on his truck and it still performs better than any other pickup he's ever had. He's had the usual maintenance done on it. He even likes the color so much that when he does finally trade, he plans to get the same color again. We pull a fifth wheel camper with it about 6,000 miles a year and he's very satisfied with the pickup's capability for that.He calls it his 'man's truck', cause he says it will do anything he needs it to do and will out perform all the other pickups on the market.<br><br>
