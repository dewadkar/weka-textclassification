            Others have gone into detail on other topics, so I'll just say:

My main buying criteria was unlimited-length video.  Only a couple do that: I tried this Sony and the Toshiba PDR-M81, which was about $150 cheaper.  The Toshiba did everything I wanted but the picture quality wasn't hardly as warm, and the camera felt small and cheap.

With 2 small kids, I love having a video camera at the ready, small enough to bring everywhere.  With a slow frame rate -- 15/sec? -- and max size 320x240, they're the movie equivalent of sloppy snapshots, but they're really fun and look OK on my computer screen.  And you can email them to the grandparents!  (Granted, they'd probably look terrible on a TV screen.)  And I've found that it's BETTER to have an array of short videos than the traditional long tape: just as you can leaf through printed photos easier than a slideshow, you can look at scenes of interest, run them again, etc.  And that task of assembling scenes into a perfect movie, that you never get around to?  You never need to.

Sure, a "real" video camera would take better movies.  But then I have to lug it everywhere, keep it around in case of unscheduled precious moments, etc.  The littleSony's just always out and at the ready.

Excellent picture quality.  I was reluctant about digital cameras because of color quality; I'm a Kodachrome-o-phile because of the warm tones.  Shots I've taken with the Sony have that same feel.  The Toshiba's pix were significantly bluer and "cooler".

The USB interface makes moving photos to my computer ridiculously easy.  Plug it in, and the camera appears as a disk drive full of JPG files.  Just copy them around.

The body is indeed a bit bulkier than the Toshiba, but it feels much more solid.  We decided to spend the extra money because the photos are precious, though the Toshiba's a great choice at $400.
