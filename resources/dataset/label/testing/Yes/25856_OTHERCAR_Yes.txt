            If you are considering purchasing a new sport utility vehicle your search should begin with the new 2000 Jeep Cherokee.  I have used mine to handle a number of different terrains, with no problems in sight.  I began by putting it through a Buffalo, New York winter.  For those of you who have never been to Buffalo in the winter, I mean snow and cold.  By putting my jeep in four wheel drive I had no trouble maneuvering through the half foot of snow.  Then when I returned to school in Tennessee I put my jeep to the test in the smokey mountains and some off road trails.  The jeep handled amazing well for one of the few SUV's under $25,000.  I would encourage any outdoor adventurer to buy this vehicle.  It will not disappoint.<br><br>
