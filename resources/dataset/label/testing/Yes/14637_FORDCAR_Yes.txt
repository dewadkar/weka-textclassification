             I have purchased a 2002 Ford Focus SE Wagon in Fort Knox Gold.  The handling is that almost of a European sports car.  A very quiet and comfortable interior with three cupholders, height-adjustable driver's seat, pencil holder, and a center armrest with storage inside.  The car's engine is very smooth and quiet, yet eager to rev up to fast speeds.  Even fully loaded with 5 people, the wagon still gets up to speed, although without quite as much pep.  The handling (of European design) is unmatched in its price range.  The wagon handles just as well as the sedan.  A great sound system includes a standard CD player with Automatic Volume Control and a removable anti-theft panel built in.  It also comes standard with remote keyless entry to unlock doors, or even the tailgate.  The tailgate can also be unlocked from the inside via a button on the drivers side, or with a standard key from the outside.  Theatre dimming lights are a nice soft touch.  The seating position is comfortable in all seats, and a tilt/telescoping enables anyone to find a comfortable seating position.  It's amazing Ford can include all these wonderful options at such a low price.  This is the best fully-loaded car money can buy for under 20!

 The wagon body of the Focus is by far the best.  With slight adjustments made in suspension the wagon rides better, has just as much pep as the sedan, can easily carry more, and has better rear-end styling.  Why not get the wagon?  Wagons are becoming increasingly more popular, and it's not hard to see why.
