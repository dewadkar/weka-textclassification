            I love the European look of this car at the low cost.I would recommend spending the extra money to invest in the ZTS. This 4 door model has leather seats, CD and a 2.0 liter
Ztech engine,power windows, power door locks, etched windows with the VIN#. (My insurance company gave me a reduction for this feature).

This car is very compfortable. It easily accomodates anyone from 5' to 6'. The front driver's seat has a manual height adjuster.The seats also offers lumbar support and is amazingly comfortable. The back seats offer plenty of leg room for a 6 footer.

The ride is fun. This car offers incredibly quick acceleration. The engine is smooth and rides equally as flawless on a highway as it does on a small country road. The car hugs the road. The ride is abit tight, but very predictable. I carpool with 2 men who state that the ride is exceptionally comfortable and like them, I feel that it rides like a much more expensive luxury model.

This is a car I enjoy driving! The brakes are great and the FOCUS has ABS brakes for emergency stops. I used them once and they worked flawlessly. The Focus rides well in the snow, which actually surprised me since it was a small car.

The instrumentation is easy to read quite accessible while driving. It is also very simple. No need to bring out the manual to find out where things are located. The headlights are BRIGHT. When I first drove at night I thought that I had the high beams on. No, the headlights just offer incredible illumination at night.

The mileage averages around 28MPG with mixed highway and city driving. I have received as much as 30MPG on exclusive highway driving. However, the average MPG is in the 26-28MPG range. 

I always ask my friends to take the Focus for a ride and they cannot beleive how much it feels like a higher priced, luxury card. Ford has gotten a bad rap and it seems like America has turned to the two giant Japanese cars as their choice of vehicles to drive. 

Why spend thousands of $$$'s extra when you can get a car that is nimble, luxurious and fun to drive?

I bought this car because I loved the way it drove. I test drove those "other" Japanese cars and found that the FOCUS
hugged the road, had great visibility over the hood and the back window, offered extreme comfort and rode smooth and had great acceleration. I compared it with the other cars and the FOCUS came out ahead in all areas.

If I had to recommend a great quality vehicle at an affordable price I suggest the FORD FOCUS ZTS.

Thumbs up for Ford!
