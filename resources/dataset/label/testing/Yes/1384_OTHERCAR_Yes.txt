            After having sold my little Mazda Mx-3 92', i decided to buy a Volkswagen Golf 3, which was a celebration edition.
I had searched very well before finding this great car. Firstly, it had 36,000 miles and that was very good for me. It is  white, 4-door with automatic tranmission.
The car was just perfect..
Now i had this car for 4 months, and the only thing i can say is that i love it. This car is perfect.. I love the way it handles the road, the wheel is so steady, and when i am driving it ifeel so secure.. it just is so great.. Not only safe, but the gas is economical too.. 
Not like the other mx-3 i had.. This one feels good..
I always loved German cars.. 
I understand though that the parts are too expensive but that doesn't matter for me because now i know i have a small, and reliable little car..
Needless to say, this car is a rocket.. and so lightweighted..
It has ABS on it and it is just perfect..
The only cons i can say about this car is that the side doors squick a liitle, but this is known to many Golfs..
Overall, i wouldn't change it for the world..
Good luck Golf lovers in finding yourselves a Golf.. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
