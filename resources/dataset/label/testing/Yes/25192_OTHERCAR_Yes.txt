            After 16 years driving a 1986 Plymouth Duster I finally broke down and bought a new (used) car in May of 2001...a 2000 Mazda Protege.  I call it a new used car because it did have one previous owner, though the car only had 2334 miles on it.

What I like:  My model is an LX w/power everything, including a moonroof.  I'm so use to a car with power nothing that power everything is heavenly.  It's a tight little sedan that looks good and is fun to drive (as long as you are not driving it up a hill).  The Protege is easy to park, has good sight visibility, and is surprisingly quiet.  With city and highway driving I am currently averaging over 29 mpg.  Five months into my purchase I have experienced no mechanical defects.

What I dislike:  Acceleration, though smooth with a four speed auto transmission is sluggish with the 1.6 litre engine.  I recommend sacrificing a little mpg and go with a 2.0 engine.  The only other thing I don't like is the lack of a coin holder.
