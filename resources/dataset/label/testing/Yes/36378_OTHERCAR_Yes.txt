            I drive 94 EX model.  I have owned 84, 87, and 92 Accords before.
This simply the best economical car that anyone can buy.  Mine
got close to 90k and still running like a new car.

The performance is stunning.  What I like the most is the dependability.
It is very hard to find a used Accord in the market for a cheep price.

I have been driving it for the past two years with no mechanical
problems.  Accord simply tells you how a product should be
evolved.  Since 1980s, its quality has been improving.

I have recommended Accords to many of my friends and they
love it.  I am hoping to drive this another 10k and move
on to the next model.
