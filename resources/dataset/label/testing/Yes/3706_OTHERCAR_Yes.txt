            Our Chevy pickup truck is a 1987 with 120,000 miles on it.  We bought this truck used 3 years ago.  We needed something dependable and strong to pull our rinker speedboat.  So since we was wanting a 8 cylinder we was looking at very high prices.  In our area the price of trucks both new and used run rather high.

We don't regret a bit buying this used chevy truck.  It has pulled our boat with NO problem at all.

It's big 350 engine is plenty for the short and long hauls to the lake and back.

We hope to get a NEW truck this year and this model will be one of the 1st we look at.
