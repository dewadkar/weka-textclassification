                After shopping around for a vehicle that would have room for us and our three large dogs, hauling building supplies and yard equipment, and camping (with the dogs), we settled on the Dodge Ram Cargo Van. 
   We decided on a full-size van for the following reasons. Because we rarely expect to have non-canine passengers, we ruled out a passenger van that would have required taking the seats out to have space in the back. We also liked the low steps/loading areas and the easy access to the back of the van from the front seats compared to a pickup truck. And with the three dogs, ourselves, and camping equipment, minivans would have been too small. 
   After deciding on a cargo van, we looked at a lot of vans, new and used, at different dealers, including Dodge, Ford, Chevy, and GMC. We quickly ruled out a used van after seeing several. In all of these, the back was trashed. They had clearly been used to haul heavy loads on a regular basis, leading us to expect that there had been significant wear and tear on the engine and the brakes. Because we were looking for a reliable vehicle that would not require much maintenance in the coming years, we didn't want to buy such a heavily used vehicle.
    Next, we began comparing the prices, quality, and options for the new vans from different dealers. Dodge had significantly lower prices for comparable models than any other brand. The only drawback seemed to be an interior that was not quite as sleek and updated as the others. But the Dodge still had a cassette stereo, large cupholders and storage bins, very comfortable seats, and the option to turn off overdrive. It didn't seem worth paying several thousand dollars more for basically a prettier color scheme and fancier dashboard styling.
    Seven months after we bought it, the back has been carpeted and paneled. This cut down significantly on road noise, which had been somewhat loud in wet weather. We have taken it on a 2,000-mile trip, in addition to regular driving, and have had no mechanical or structural problems.
  The van handles well and is surprisingly maneuverable for such a large vehicle. It also rides relatively smoothly for a big vehicle and is comfortable on long trips.
  We opted for the 2500, V-8 knowing that we'd want to pull a trailer with it at some point. Driving over the continental divide pulling a fully loaded trailer posed no problems for the engine.
    We only have 2 complaints. The first is the dismal gas mileage (about 13+ mpg), though that seems comparable for other vehicles in its class. The second is that it doesn't handle well in snow unless there's a lot of weight in the back. After sliding off the road once soon after we bought it, we put 280 lbs of sand in the back and didn't have any more problems after that.
    Overall, we are happy with our Dodge Ram Cargo Van and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a reasonably-priced, reliable vehicle big enough to haul stuff.
