            I recently totalled my 1996 Jetta III GLS in a rainy highway accident. The car protected me from all injury but that is another story.

The only vehicle I would consider to replace my &quot;buddy&quot; was another Jetta. From the first test drive of a 2000 VW Jetta, I knew there was no other car to look at. With that in mind I still tested the Camry and the Accord. The Honda and the Toyota matched the reliability of the VW in all reports I researched but behind the wheel neither of them gave me the feel and confidence of the Volkswagon. I purchased my Jetta GLS automatic at Tischer in Columbia, Maryland. I told them exactly what I wanted and what I wanted to pay for it and they gave me just what was ordered. I drove one home the first day.

My Jetta, &quot;Jenna,&quot; is a base model GLS with automatic transmission and mudflaps as the only options. She is black with beige interior. In the five months I have owned her I have driven 6500+ flawless miles and I am even more in love with the car's style and handling than ever. The automatic transmission is so smooth you forget what gear you are in. The ride is so smooth it feels like you are floating, but you can still feel the road and the suspension gives great feedback. The cupholders have been improved and multiplied. A spacious glovebox is a nice addition too. Raising the hood is now accomplished with gas shocks, no more prop rod! The doors close snug and road noise is considerably less than my '96. The trunk space is still large, however, my golf clubs don't seem to fit neatly lengthwise anymore like they did on the '96. New 15&quot; Goodyear Eagle tires offer incredible grip and ride. A major improvement over previous years' 14&quot; wheels.

The only flaw is the slightly narrower trunk and the low powered speakers. There are eight speakers, one midrange in each door panel and tweeters near the inside door handles. The tweeters lack power and distort rather easily. 

I still give this 2000 Volkswagon Jetta GLS as many stars as are allowed.<br><br>
