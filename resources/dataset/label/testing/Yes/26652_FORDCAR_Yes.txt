            Yes Folks!!! I get thirty-plus miles to the gallon on the highway and at least twenty in city traffic.  What a joy it it is to be able to drive two-hundred and fifty miles between inconvenient fill-ups!!! The car is reliable, it's continually being updated (mine is a '95), and it's cheap.  I HIGHLY recommend this car to any college student because of the low cost of purchase and maintenance--especially in warmer climates.  

It has an excellent heating and cooling system, a big trunk and a big spare tire. A two-door hatchback, the escort is excellent for hauling medium loads without borrowing your friends' pickup-you can even camp in it!! I do a lot of travelling and commuting in my car and I've never really had any major problems with it.  The features of this car are a little weird being that the seatbelts and mirrors are automatic and the antenna and windows are manual...but that suits me just fine. It's easy to find a space for this compact anywhere and even my fifteen year old brother can parallel park it with ease.  In addition, it's got a great sound system which won't eat your tapes.

This car can corner very well due to it's small size and sensitive steering system and believe it or not I feel safer in it on winding roads than I have in my friends sports cars.  Overall this is a great deal on a car...and if just under $12,000 is still too steep for you then buy a used one (like a '95).

See ya later,

LCATT34
