            I really liked my Mustang the first year I had it.  I drive a long way to school and work every day, so the fact that the car provided a nice ride made my daily trips a little easier.  I have some major complaints now, though... First off, it's such a noisy car.  Any kind of road noise seeps into the car, and it has all sorts of rattles and creaks after only 3 years of driving it.  Second, the air conditioner is already shot.  It doesn't even spit out cool air.  Third, the cigarette lighter was broken almost from the start, and for some weird reason, the mechanic can't fix it for under $250.  So unfortunately, I can't charge anything in my car now.  (I should have had it fixed while it was still under warranty)  Also, even though the Mustang is pretty roomy for a sports car, its still small, and doesn't have a lot of storage space if you have a lot of stuff.  Other than that, it has everything I need and gets me from point A to point B, and its never left me stranded.
