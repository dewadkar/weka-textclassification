            My 1999 Ford Escort is the first new car I've ever had.  I've been through a couple of used clunkers, but this is the first new one, so maybe my opinion is a little biased.  After all, I have had no other new cars to compare it with, but I'll give it me best try.

O.K. I'm a freak, but my friend and I have always named our cars. He has had Bessie, Celesta, and Artemis.  I have had Omar the Omni and Gigi the LeMans.  My Escort was a hard car to name.  Why is any of this relevant you may ask.  Well don't ask, it just helps to describe my car.  O.K.  first of all it's an Escort; that's a hard model to come up with a good sounding name.  

Omar, was easily a masculine car; he was clunky and dark gray, he just seemed like a guy to me.  GiGi was a girl, she was red and had a perky little horn, well, I don't know, I just knew she was a girl.  Right now you're thinking I've lost it right?  Well, I probably have, but that's beside the point.  When the time came to name my Escort it was very hard.

First of all let me explain what my Escort looks like.  Sure, you probably know, but you would be surprised how many think the Escort is still the square little hatchback of the eighties; well it isn't.  My car is sleek and rounded, no squares at all.  I picked a silver one because I thought it was classier looking, it makes it look more like a luxury car; not that it's close.  But someone the other day did ask me what my car was.  When I said Escort, they were completely surprised, they told me they thought it was an Acura; obviously they don't know much about cars, but hey it makes me feel good.

My Escort is a very dependable car, it gets great mileage.  Well great compared to my LeMans; it gets about 28-30 miles per gallon.  It runs really well, you can't hear it at all.  When I have my radio off and my air off, I can't tell if it's running or not when sitting at a red light.  It also came with a six c.d. changer included.  I have the SE model.  It is safe, it has dual airbags.  It also came with cruise control.  It really is a nice car, I don't have any problems with it at all.  I love it.

However, back to the subject of naming it.  It doesn't really have a feel of a certain sex; it's androgynous.  I tried and tried to think of androgynous names and one day I happened to watch the Matrix.  All of their names are androgynous, especialy Neo and Morpheus.  There was something about the name Morpheus that stuck to me.  I really liked that name and I know that Morpheus was one of the lower gods in greek or Roman mythology.  So that is the name I decided to use; I tried it for a couple of weeks and it really works.  Morpheus is calm and elusive, and the god isn't as important as the others, but still Morpheus is a god.  That's what my car is like.  It's calm and dependable and seems to have more power and prestige than it actually does.

So I really love Morpheus.  Morpheus is a great car.  It has never given me any troubles; not one.  It runs super good, warns me about everything.  And you know my favorite thing is the engine.  I know how to change oil, but I never knew where anything else was.  Well on Morpheus, all of the fluid containers are very well marked, you can easily read them.  I really like that; I mean, I take it to the Ford Garage, it's still under warranty, but when the warranty is up, at least I'll know how to do a little bit.  Actually I take that back, my very favorite thing is the keyless entry.  I have an anti-theft system and automatic lock that I can use from my key chain, it's really nice and make me feel safe.

I have nothing but great experience with my Escort.  I don't know if everyone has had such luck, but I really do like my car. Of course they don't make Escorts anymore, last year was the last year, but if you're looking at Escorts, I recommend them.  I know I love my Morpheus.<br><br>
