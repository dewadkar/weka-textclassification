            I have always wanted a Digital camera since they were first introduced.  Of course back then they cost quite a bit more then they do now.  I really wanted the digital camera to be able to take pictures of my family.  We have several relatives that live far away and itï¿½s nice to share pictures with them via the Internet. Not to mention it would just be a darn fun thing to have.

I wasn't really sure what I was looking for when I first went shopping for a digital camera.  I was just sort of reading whatever I could find on the topic and looking around a lot here on epinions.  I saw in the newspaper that the Sony DSC-S30 was on sale at the electronics store near my home.  It looked nice to me in the ad so I went over to check it out.  I really didn't need a digital camera that was on a professional level. I just wanted something that would be easy to use and would last.  Upon arriving at the store I was overwhelmed by what a big selection of camera's they had on display.  How would I ever decide?  Of course the sale guy who was all of 18 was no help.  He didn't care what I was saying he was just interested in showing me the most expensive cameras. 

I looked a bit at the various cameras that they had.  I liked the Sony DSCS70 also but with a price tag of 800.00 I decided that I didn't like it that much.  I found the DSCS30 and started looking it over.  It offered me many great features for a good price.  After spending about 25 minutes playing with it, taking pictures of the useless sales guy and reading the instructions that came with it. I decided that this would be the camera that I went with.

Some of the general specifications of this camera are:

1.3 mega pixel
3X Optical Zoom
6X Digital Zoom
Auto Focus
Auto Flash
2&quot; LCD Display screen that is crystal clear
Removable 4 MB Memory stick
USB port and Cable 

This digital camera is also capable of being hooked right up to Sony's Digital printer to print out your photos right on the spot.  That's something I may consider at some point.  The camera itself is small easy to handle.  Not bulky or hard to carry.  There is a great menu system in it with a one-button control.  I really didn't have to read much of the instruction manual to figure it out.  It was very user friendly.

Taking the pictures is a breeze you simple point it and click the shutter button down half way. You are able to delete out any pictures that you don't like. You store them on your memory stick and then you can view them either on the LCD display or by hooking your camera up to your computer through the USB port.  There you can download your photos in either
Jpeg or Tiff format.  Then simply save the one's you want on your hard drive.  Another great feature is that you can hook up the camera to your television set to view the pictures on the larger screen in a slide show type of presentation.  This is great for a family get together.  The pictures appear clear and sharp with color.

A Lithium battery is included with your camera as well as a charger for it.  It takes about 2 hours to charge it to full power and then will run at least that long.  On the display is a number indicating how long your battery has left so there aren't any surprises. Also the LCD display allows you to see several other things like the zoom power you are using.  Also when you go from Optical zoom to Digital zoom. How much room is left on your memory stick and much more.

The camera is very easy to set up and take virtually no time to go from the box to taking photos.  I simply popped on the strap, lens cover and inserted the memory stick.  One thing I would recommend is to spend a bit extra for a larger memory stick.  The 4mb one that is included can be filled up very quickly.  Over all I think this is a great camera that will last us for a very long time.  It was highly worth the price we paid of 499.99.
