            I bought the Mitsubishi Mirage in 1998 because it was the cheapest way out of my 1995 lease on a Mitsubishi Galant.  I had gone WAY over the allotted mileage in the terms of the lease, plus I could tell several things were about to go wrong with the car so I didn't want to buy it out.  The only option we had was to buy another car from the dealer we had leased from.  I didn't want an Eclipse because I formerly owned an Eagle Talon (the sister car to the Eclipse) and it simply is scary to drive in the winter because it did not adhere to the road.  So basically the only option I had was to buy the Mirage.  I still had to finance some leftover money I owed on the Galant with the cost of the Mirage.  I think I will be in debt to Mitsubishi forever.

I was pretty happy with my purchase initially.  I bought (NOT leased this time because I knew I would be putting on a ton of miles) a red 2-door manual transmission, just the basics, black interior.  I especially liked the way it looked from the outside.  It looks pretty sporty for such a cheap car.  I also like the solid feel to it.  I have had good experiences with Mitsubishi sales and service. Twice they have honored the warranty slightly after it expired--even on expensive repairs($1000+).  The console looks nice considering the cost of the car and the floor mats aren't cheap looking.

Overall, I would say that the car handles very well, even in the snow.  I feel safe in it for its size.  The windows can be pretty noisy at times--usually when it's windy.  It is not all that comfortable, but it is bearable for a few hours at a time.

My car now has over 70,000 miles and hasn't even needed new tires.  I have done only the basics for maintenance.  I believe I had trouble with the air conditioning at one point, but it was covered under the warranty.  Generally with Mitsubishi's I always have a major air conditioning problem and transmission problem sometime before the 60K warranty expires.  I did not have any trouble with the transmission on this car probably because it has a manual transmission.

I really don't like the pattern they added to the seat covers and inside the doors.  I think it makes it look even cheaper than it feels.  They should have stuck with solid colors.  Also because the interior is black, it always looks dirty.  It is often necessary for me to eat breakfast or dinner in my car, and I can barely tolerate it.  Every crumb shows.  The console also looks dusty all of the time.  I am one to keep a clean car, but it is nearly impossible with this interior and my busy lifestyle.  I've learned that I never want black interior ever again!

I was in a very low speed accident where the front bumper cracked.  This also happened with another Mitsubishi I owned, but hasn't happened with other cars even at higher speeds.  It is very expensive to repair because the whole bumper has to be replaced when this happens.  (I am not a terrible driver--my husband and I just drive a lot every day so it's bound to happen!)

The thing I am most dissatisfied with is the fact that the door hinge broke on the driver's side damaging the door over time (before we knew there was anything wrong with it.)  The door no longer can be opened for fear of it not lining up correctly to be able to shut it.  The extended warranty does not cover the door hinges although it covered a flat tire.  This seems very bizarre to me.  It will cost $700+ to replace the door and I'm not sure whether that included painting it or not.  Since we cannot afford that right now, we are climbing in from the passenger side in order to drive it.  Needless to say I am not all that happy with my car right now.  The scary part is that the passenger side is heavy and squeaky at times just like the broken door was for a time before it broke.  Oh no!
