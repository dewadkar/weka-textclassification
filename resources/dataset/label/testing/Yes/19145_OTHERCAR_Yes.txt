            This car is one of the best looking passenger wagons on the market.  It comes with all the basic essentials as basic equipment.  The interior is laid out nicely.  All the interior parts are high quality.  The turbo four provides more than enough acceleration with a stick shift.  Meanwhile it provides excellent fuel economy.  I have had only one minor problem with this car.  The car leaked power steering fluid.  This problem was repaired at no charge under warranty.  This is also another big plus about Volkswagon, their warranty coverage is excellent.  
I bought this car because compared to the ford taurus wagon, it is a much sexier proposition.  The car is composed during hard cornering and handles  bumps with aplomb.  
Quibbles: The back seats are a little to firm.  My only major problem with this car is the seat adjusters.  To recline the seat back, one needs to turn a little knob. The car is a bit pricy compared to a taurus wagon .<br><br>
