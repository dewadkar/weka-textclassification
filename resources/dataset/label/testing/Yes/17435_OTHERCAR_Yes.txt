            Many people do not realize that Isuzu Motors makes the Honda Passport. So why would anyone buy a Passport over a Rodeo? It depends on what you are looking for in a sport utility. 

I like the looks of the Passport to begin with. Not every one is driving one of these around. Next is I spend a lot of time in the vehicle so I wanted to be comfortable. The EX model has all the amenities you may be looking for that just are not offered on the Rodeo. Moon roof, floor mats, AM/FM cassette, wood grain trim . . . It makes it seem as though I am in a really big car and not a covered truck. Comfortable.

Not convinced yet? Are you going to drive this vehicle forever? Than resale is not important to you. If this is going to get you around for just a few years look at the resale of a Honda compared to a Isuzu. The difference was large enough to push me to the Passport.<br><br>
