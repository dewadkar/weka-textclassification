            This is the third Dodge Caravan I have owned, the first being an '87 and the second a '96.  The '87 was a good vehicle, had good acceleration and ran well for the first 7 years, but then played out; the transmission and air conditioning both began to have regular problems.  The '96 Grand Caravan ran very well with only one exception, the transmission.

My new '99 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport is far superior in all aspects to the first two.  It accelerates and handles extremely well, is an attractive vehicle, and the air conditioning and heating have met the needs of my entire family.  The CD, tape deck and radio all function very well, and the speakers have really good sound.  I very much enjoy driving this van.  The only possible exception is that I have lingering worries about transmission problems with any Dodge Caravan, but so far so good.  Also, personally I would have preferred a little more leg room when in the driver's seat.  This vehicle will be a good buy and a good experience for any one who enjoys driving.  It rides well and is fun.  It has met all the needs of my family for long-distance trips and for around town travel.  <br><br>
