            This past weekend, I sought to escape the hyper-active island of Manhattan for a more serene setting so, I went to Dollar's website and reserved a Dodge Intrepid for the weekend.  Fortunately, when I went there, they didn't have the car in (making me wonder why I made a reservation).  They upgraded me to the next class for free.  And so, I pulled onto 54th street in a close to brand new (about 400 miles on it) 2001 Chrysler Concorde.

What an excellent car this is.  Realize that I only had it for a weekend, but I have very little to say against this car.  Let's begin the review, in no particular order.

-----

LOOKS

It is my honest opinion that the new Chrysler cars are some of the best looking cars on the road these days, even when compared to the high-end cars made by those funny European types.  More so on the Chrysler LHS, but there's something about that front end that looks really, really cool.  The rental came in this beautiful silver color.  I've seen this car in other colors, but silver is definitely the best, though black looks pretty darn good.  For a $22,000 car (base price) it looks great.  The interior has a nice luxurious feel also.  No wood trim, but who the heck really wants that anyway??

-----

COMFORT

The seats are the perfect combination of support and softness.  I felt like I was sitting in an easy chair the whole time.  The radio and climate controls are on level with the steering wheel and close enough to the driver that I had just had to move my right hand a little to operate both.  Cupholders pop out of the armrests.  They aren't going to hold big-gulp cups very securely, but their placement means I don't have to lean forward to grab a drink.

The ride is also incredibly smooth.  Even riding around the beat-up streets of Manhattan (on the way out of the city!!) I was really impressed with how even the ride was.  My girlfriend in the passenger seat was putting on her eye make-up.

-----

NOISE LEVEL

When I first started the car, I was still in the parking garage where Dollar has there cars stored, with the car doors closed and the windows up.  I turned the key and heard nothing.  Not one sound.  I had to open the door so make sure the car was actually running.  On the highway, it was extremely quite.   It has a very aerodynamic shape, so there is very little wind noise.

-----

SPACE

This car is HUGE.  There is space everywhere.  The glove box is big, the armrest storage is big, the backseat is big (YES!!)  The trunk is a monster!!

-----

PERFORMANCE

This model was the LX with a 2.7L engine and 200hp.  Don't know 0-60 times or braking distance or anything, but whizzing around the city streets, I think it handled really well.  This isn't a Porsche, but the steering is really responsive, the brakes are good, and for it's size, I found acceleration good also.  If you are more performance minded, consider the LXi, which has a 3.2L engine and 22 more horsepower along with ABS braking.  ABS braking is important to me since I drive aggressively (which is not necessarily a good thing).  22 more hp?  Not sure if it would make that much of a difference.

-----

SIZE OF THE CAR

This car is fairly big.  While a bigger car feels safer, has a more luxurious feel, and has a lot more space, the size takes away from it's nimbleness.  It's harder to park and you can't squeeze into a tight spot as easily.

-----

BLIND SPOTS

The car slants upward from the front, which looks really cool, but when you are trying to look over your right shoulder to back up or to get over into a lane, it is hard to see.  The "C" pillar ("A" pillar is the part of the frame that is on the left and right side of the windshield.  "B" pillar is the frame between the driver and rear passenger windows.  "C" pillar is the frame right over the shoulder of the rear passengers.) is huge and also cuts off the view.  Even worse is the rear view.  The trunk is so high that it reduces the size of the rear window considerably.  Also, you cannot see the front end of the car at all.  My last car was a Jeep Cherokee so maybe I'm spoiled.  I could get that right front bumper on my Jeep within an inch of anything.

-----

MILEAGE

I paid $2.07/gallon, so this is something to really consider, especially since a lot of people think prices are going even higher.  This ain't no Honda Civic; I got gas mileage in the high teens with a mix of city driving and highway driving.

-----

RADIO

OK as is.  AM/FM tape deck with four speakers.  Music is very important to me.  This car has such good sound deadening of outside noises, it is really a shame to have a bad sound system.  The upgrade to AM/FM/tape deck/CD Player with 8 speakers for $527 would be a must for me.

-----

PRICING

This is the interesting part.  If you take the LX and add all the options you can to put it on par with the base LXi, the total cost is $2564 less than the LXi. (Please, please don't take my word for this.  I could have made a mistake easily in comparing options with standard features, etc.  Go to edmunds.com and check it out yourself.  I used MSRP for convenience.)  The only option you can't get is the engine.  So, you are in effect paying $2564 for 22 horsepower and .5L.  Again, it might be a noticeable difference.  Check it out at a dealer.

At base with no options, I think the LX is still a good deal. For 1300 more than a Honda Accord EX, you get a much cooler car.

If you do end up with the LXi, I would seriously, seriously consider spending the extra $2000 and getting the Chrysler LHS (I drove one last year.)  Nearly everything you would pay for on the LXi is standard, plus you get a 3.5L engine, 253hp, a cooler front end, and other things that you aren't standard on the LXi.  That is a near perfect car and a steal at the price.  I've seen it going for under $28K on the internet.  It's my realistic dream car right now.
