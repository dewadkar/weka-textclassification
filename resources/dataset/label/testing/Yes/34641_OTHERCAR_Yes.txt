            I have just purchased a 2000 Montana.  I previously owned a Plymouth Voyager.  After 3 transmissions in five years I decided I needed a change.  I had already test driven a Pontiac and decided it was for me.  I can't say enough good about the van.  It handles better, it's roomier  and I get the same gas mileage in this 6 cyl. as I did in the 4.  Friends riding in it commented on the cornering and the comfort even in the back seats.  Who should buy it?  Everyone and anyone, I have already recommended it to my 80 year old parents.<br><br>
