            <b>FIRST IMPRESSION:</b>

I saw a commercial for the new Honda Odyssey during a football game. looked sharp.  As I was going to work, I stumbled across one on the freeway...it looked <i>really</i> sharp.  The older Odysseys didn't really catch my attention, but the new ones did.  I also read about the so-called 'magic' rear seat and the 210 HP V6 engine that come standard.  I'm not a 'minivan'-type of guy, but the Odyssey sure looked good.

<b>TEST DRIVE:</b>

My test-drive experience with the Odyssey was good.  It felt solid when getting in.  The doors shut and the cabin was isolated from the outside noise.  The instrument panel was very well laid out and the controls were within reach.  The shifter may get in the way, but it's something very little and you can probably get used to it fairly quickly.  The view from the 'cockpit' was grand.  The road ahead is clearly visible and checking blind-spots isn't all that bad.  It has quite a bit of pick-up-and-go and the road noise is kept to a minimum.  Handling a minivan can't get any easier.  There may be times when you think you're driving a car, not a minivan.  

My father-in-law was looking into buying a minivan, so he had the usual list of vans to see.  The well-known Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager, Toyota Sienna, Mazda MPV, and the Ford Windstar.  The main reason he was considering the Caravan/Voyager was because they were one of the first minivans to roam the planet, thus, they <i>must</i> know how minivans should be made...right?  And the ever-so-popular Toyota Sienna raised an eyebrow because it rated fairly well in crash tests and Toyota is rated well in Consumer Reports...but was it as good as it was said to be?  The Windstar looked promising and it was backed by the Ford badge.  And finally, the MPV looked like a good contender.  I just had to butt in and tell my father-in-law about the Honda Odyssey.  He went to the dealership and found that the Odyssey was a very well made minivan with all the right options he was looking for.  He eventually bought the <b>LX model</b> because it came with just the right options (plus, he had no need for the remote sliding doors that are standard on the EX model).


<b>FEATURES ON THE LX MODEL:</b>

The LX model comes equipped with the following as standard:

- 3.5 liter V6 engine
- 4-speed automatic transmission
- 16&quot; steel wheels w/ covers 
- 20 gallon fuel tank
- AM/FM Cassette stereo w/ 4 speakers  
- Retractable 3rd row <i>Magic</i> seat
- Plenty of cup-holders
- Dual airbags
- Anti-theft system
- Power front &amp; rear-quarter windows, locks, steering, brakes
- Cruise control
- AC for front &amp; rear
- Center console with cupholders and shelf
- Rear-seat heater ducts
- Privacy glass


<b>FUEL ECONOMY:</b>

For the amount of power this puppy puts out, the gas mileage is pretty good.  It's estimated at around 18 MPG in the city while being able to achieve 25 MPG in the highway.  I heard from my father-in-law that he got up to 30 MPG when traveling from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and back.  He said even city driving got him about 22 MPG.  Not bad at all.  


<b>WARRANTY:</b>

The Honda Odyssey comes standard with a 3-year/36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.  It also comes with roadside assistance.  


<b>SUMMARY:</b>

My father-in-law loves his ride.  The Odyssey really puts a smile on his face and all is good.  I really dig the <i>Magic</i> seat.  I'm wondering why the other auto manufacturers couldn't come up with the idea.  Taking out the seats are a pain in the <i>you-know-what</i>.  I had to help my friend put back, what was suppose to be an 'easy installing' rear seat in his parent's Dodge Caravan and we almost died of a hernia.  It was more rigorous than a 30-minute Tae-Bo workout.  The new Honda Odyssey eliminates the pain of removing/installing and also the storage of the 3rd seat when you don't need it.  For that alone, I would buy this minivan!  The other traits that come with the Odyssey are great.  You pretty much get the Honda quality and the physics of a minivan.  I'm guessing that one problem you're going to face is trying to buy one for a good deal.  These vans are HOT.  Good luck getting the color and model you want.  In any case, you'll have to go to you nearest Honda dealer to check it out.  This minivan is a <b>2-thumbs up</b> in my book.  <br><br>
