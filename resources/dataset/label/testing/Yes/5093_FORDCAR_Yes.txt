            My husband and I have owned several unreliable cars over the last 15 years.  The worst car we owned was a 1990 Chevy Lumina.  The best car we've owned is our baby, our 1997 Ford Taurus.  We wanted a reliable and safe car.  I had done some research on the internet and learned that the Taurus is rated very well for safety.  We have always liked the style of the Taurus, so it was time to buy one.  We bought our 1997 Taurus in July of 99.  Our dream car!  We have owned our Taurus now for eight months, and have not had one single problem with it.  It's a very comfortable ride, very safe and secure feeling while driving, the size is perfect, not too small, not too big.  It has driver and passenger airbags, and a very sizeable back seat, which fits my daughters carseat very comfortably.  An extremely reliable, comfortable, family car.<br><br>
