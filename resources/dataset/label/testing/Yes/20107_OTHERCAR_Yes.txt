            The new BMW M5 combines extreme performance and supreme luxury in one masterpiece of a car. BMW outdoes itself again with the production of the M5. The M5 produces 394 hp and 368 lb of torque. Making it the most powerful BMW on the market. The M5 comes with a V-8 and goes 0-60 mph in an amazing 4.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 155 mph. The manual version also comes in a sweet six-speed for those family men with a desire to punch it through all six gears. When was the last time you saw a luxury car BEATING Porsche's and Vett's? This is the first time for me.

This car is definitely for those out there who wanted a rommy and fast car because they had a family. Most family people have to get cars with space and that are usually slow because of their size. Not only is the M5 fast it can fit up to five people. The car looks great too. With its low to the ground body design and big threatening intake. The M5 also comes with some nice sporty 18&quot; rims and wide 275 tires in the rear and 245 tires in the front. That's also really rare, a family car with nice rims. BMW must have asked the family man for his dream car when designing this beauty. 

I would definitely go out and buy this car, if I could. The definite drawback to this car is its price. Coming in at about 70k not many family people can afford it. The idea is wonderful though of owning a family NSX. This car is also not recommended for those who want a car with extreme performance. When BMW designed this car it was for fun speed on the road, definitely not the race track. I do not recommend this car to all my racing friends out there.<br><br>
