            To summarize the finer points of the Focus, I use the following few words: style, power, and economy.

I bought my Ford Focus from Henson Ford in Madisonville, TX (a great dealership)... and I immediately drove it 2200 miles from Texas to Colorado and back.  It never skipped a beat.  The gas mileage wasn't as ideal as I had hoped, but I was carrying a heavy load of camping gear and clothes.  

The interior is charcoal black, cloth seats.  I've never been a big fan of dark interiors, or even cloth, as they are so hard to keep clean.  However, this interior is much easier to keep clean than I would have imagined.  

I got the package with the 2.0L Zetec engine, which winds up being basically the same as the base engine in terms of fuel economy, but gives you considerably greater power (I tested this notion in the test-drive).  I never had a problem climbing the hills/mountains of Colorado, or having enough power to pass the occasional driver who dared to travel merely at the speed limit.  

Great trunk space, loving all the fantastic features... I highly recommend.<br><br>
