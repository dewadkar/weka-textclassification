            The Olympus C-2500L is an excellent digital camera if you are looking for something that has crisp, high-quality images without the heavy price tag of the professional models.  Being an SLR-type camera, it is pretty easy-going on its battery resources.  It comes with 4 NiMH batteries, and a full charge is good for around 200+ flashless shots, or around 100+ shots using the internal flash.

There are a few drawbacks to this camera.

1.  You can't exchange lenses like you can on professional digital cameras.  You can 'add' filters and zoom attachments to the existing internal lens, though.

2.  Get an external flash for Macro shots!  The macro capability of this camera is quite good!  However, the barrel of the lens will block the internal flash.  If you don't have good ambient lighting, an external flash is a must for the macros.  The internal flash is quite powerful for standard snapshots, though.

3.  There are only 2 aperture settings.  If you want to get fancy with this camera, you are limited somewhat in what you can do.

4.  No analog manual focus.  This camera can do manual focus, but you must enter the distance.  I.e., if your target is 5ft away, you must push the manual focus button until it displays '5ft'..  there is no lens barrel to turn to do it analog-style.

Aside from those 4 main drawbacks, this is an *excellent* camera.  You will find it *very* difficult to fool the autofocus on this camera I think I've only had to use the manual focus 2 times in the 6 months I've been using this camera.  I have not been disappointed with it yet!  You should be able to find them for under $800.00 these days, as well.<br><br>
