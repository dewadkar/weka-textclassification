            My family bought our Beretta GT brand-new in 1990.  We needed a new car because my mother's old car died.  We shopped around a while and finally decided on this maroon beauty.  Or at least it used to be.

Now, ten years later, the car is still running fine.  My mom has gotten another new car and the Beretta has been passed on to me.  I have had very few mechanical problems with my Beretta.  In fact, it has been very dependable.  We have only had to do the normal fix-ups common to ten-year-old cars.

The problem is more superficial.  The appearance has become somewhat less than beautiful.  Today, my Beretta has peeling paint on the rear spoiler.  Instead of maroon, parts of it have turned yellow.  Also, on the inside, the door panels have fallen off and the rest of the interior shakes violently when I get to around 50 mph.

The car has been pretty dependable.  Its just that I would expect the appearance to keep up with the mechanics.  If something like this doesn't bother you, then a Beretta can be an excellent purchase.<br><br>
