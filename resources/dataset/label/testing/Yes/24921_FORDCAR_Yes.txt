                   You got to love a Mustang. They are so awesome.  There is nothing getting behind the wheel of one of these. No matter what year or style.  I am an owner of two wonderful Mustangs.  One is a 1990 GT 5.0, covertible....and a 1999 GT 4.6.  I am in love with them both.  I am currently looking for an old Fastback.  Anyways,  The Mustang is the far best thing Ford has ever built.  It is great on pick-up, and it hugs the corners like it is nothing.  What I like best is the looks you get when go rumbleing by.  You should see one of these things lay a patch. It is totally cool.  If your looking for something with power and looks you are looking at the right thing. It has style, looks, and power. Mustang is the way to go.<br><br>
