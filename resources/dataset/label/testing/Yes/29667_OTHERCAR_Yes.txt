            The $21,695 Regal LS is powered by a 3.8-liter, 200-horsepower V-6, which has five more horsepower this year. The $24,395 GS model has a supercharged, 240-horsepower version of that engine, along with a stiffer suspension and wider tires to handle the added power. But the well-equipped LS has plenty of muscle for fast merges and quick passing. It has sharper moves for 1999 because its newly modified suspension improves handling and takes unwanted float from the smooth ride. There's a $600 sport suspension with wider tires, but most LS buyers don't need it. The engine is hooked to a smooth four-speed automatic transmission that allows the V-6 to loaf at 1,900 r.p.m. at 65 m.p.h. No wonder the LS delivers an estimated, impressive 30 mpg on the highway.
