            I picked this camera up from mobshop, and put it through
some tests. This camera has been given negative reviews,
so I was dubious of its quality.

I have to say it's not as horrible as some people have
painted a picture. The camera was easy to get ready,
and I took a few pictures and then uploaded them to my PC.

The first thing I noticed is you must have great lighting
conditions first. I just left the flash on all the time,
and that fixed most of my picture problems. 

The second is to make sure you have the latest version
of the camera software, which can be downloaded from the
corporate website.

The pictures are 640x480, which is good enough for taking
pictures of stuff I want to sell on eBay, but it's not
as good as a Kodak or Olympus digital camera.

If you can find this camera for $50 or less, it's worth
a shot. But if you have to spend $100, find a better camera.
