            I recently bought a black 1992 525i fully loaded with 92,000 miles. It is a gorgeous automobile; however, I got to drive it about 5 days before it overheated costing over $3500 to bring back to road worthiness.

It seems that the impellers on the water pump are made from some sort of plastic that rots over the years. This was the original source of my frustrations. When the pump went out, so did my radiator (cracked), the thermostat, the heater core, and of course, the head was warped. By the way, do not apply any pressure to the hose where it connects to the radiator. It too is plastic and will snap off in a heartbeat. You will have to buy an entire radiator (approx. $400) just to fix a snapped off hose neck.

It took almost 2 months to get it out of the shop and when I did, it still gives funny signals on the on board computer indicating something may be wrong....but it's just not sure what.

I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone wishing to buy a BMW; however, be sure to spend the extra money to have a qualified BMW mechanic inspect the vehicle prior to purchase,<br><br>
