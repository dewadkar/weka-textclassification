            The pictures are breathtaking. As a graduate student in this advanced age computer work is becoming increasingly important. When I needed a digital camera for my projects in archaeological research but didn't have $800 to spend, I decided on the Olympus 360L and it was a great choice.
I paid around $270 for this 1.3 megapixel camera and have never looked back. Unless you are a photographer and can tell the difference between 1.3 megapixels and 2.0 or higher you don't need the higher pixel count. This was a concern of mine when I started looking at cameras, but when I held up shots from this camera and a 2.1 megapixel camera I couldn't tell the difference. 
There are some things that might rule out this camera for you. These are as follows:
1.lens: it is glass which is great but you cannot remove this lens and add a zoom.
2.zoom: only has 2x digital zoom which might not be enough for you or if you need a higher quality zoom look for a camera with optical zoom.
3.size: for me this is a plus since I needed a smaller camera in which the lens can be closed for protection but you might want a more professional feeling, bigger camera.
4.memory: This camera uses the thin Smartmedia card type memory over the compact flash. It doesn't bother me but you have to be very careful not to break the cards.
5. Connection: it connects to the computer trough the serial port. Just be aware of what you want.

I don' want to give the impression that this camera is not good because I love it, but all digital cameras are meant for specific things. You have to find the one you need for your projects. The battery life of this camera is awesome and so is the pictures quality. The LCD on the back is nice and bright and easy to see outside. It takes great pictures inside and out and includes several types of flashes for every type of picture.<br><br>
