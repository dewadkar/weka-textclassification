            I am an extremely picky car person and had done a lot of research before buying my wife a Jeep Liberty.  I am 6'2" tall and can fit comfortably into the drivers seat.  The best thing about the Jeep Liberty is its reliability, features, and cost.  We have had no problems with our Liberty and there are all the major functions and accessories.  Ours has the 6 cylinder engine for the get up and go aspect.  Power everything, and the stock CD Stereo system is above par.  The full sized spare tire is also a major plus.  The leather seats are comfortable and roomy as well as all the extra outlets for cell phones and other gadgets.  The Liberty is not as large as most SUV's and gets pretty good gas mileage as well.  The back seating area gets a little cramped when I sit in the front because of my large stature.  We also wished it had the visors with extenders to block the sides.  The Liberty is also more of a feminine vehicle to me as well.  My wife had the unfortunate situation on the highway where she was rear ended.  The pickup truck that hit her was totalled and our liberty only needed to be washed and have some scratches buffed out!
