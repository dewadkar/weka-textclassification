            When you're driving down the road in a mustang you just know that everyone is checking you out.  At least that's what I think when I'm driving mine.

The Ford Mustang is the true American car; it is the embodiment of Henry Ford's dream.  The pure power behind its V6 engine is incredible, and the pick up is great (only regular gas is required!).  The interior seems very large in the front and the back seat is only somewhat cramped.  The sound system is good but if it's not enough it can always be upgraded.  The trunk is huge for such a sporty car (the first time I opened it I figured I could put a lot of bodies in there...but uh, never mind).  One of the best things about this car is of course its body, which impresses everyone who sees it.

My advice is that if you're looking to purchase a new or used car, then go with a Ford Mustang.<br><br>
