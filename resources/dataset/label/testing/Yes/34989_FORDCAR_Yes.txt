            I didn't always drive my 1990 Ford Probe GL.  I used to have a cherry (I made it that way) 1965 Ford Mustang that was my ride; however, after getting it into a minor accident (his fault) I decided it was time to switch until I graduated from college and could take it to a safer place.  Now anyone who knows me, knows I'm a car nut, especially with nice sports cars.  I was looking at new Bimmers (3-series coupes), new Mustangs, and all sorts of nice cars for a replacement.  I was kinda stumped, since being a college student, I did want a nice car, but I wasn't sure if getting a new 30,000$ vehicle was really all that practical. 

A fellow coworker of mine was selling his car, and had been for the last year.  It was a 1990 Ford Probe 2-door GL (2.2L DOHC 4-cylinder), Front Disc/Rear Drum, A/T for 3000$.  He was asking over 5000$ for it when he first had it for sale, but after no offers for 12 months he kept reducing the price.  The car was in good condition (he meticulously kept all the records for it) was never in an accident, had only 96k miles on it and looked good to boot.  After a test drive, I figured that this would make a good transition car---something I could use for 2-3 years until I graduated, that would be reliable but not something I would worry over (like a '65 Stang).

And after owning this car for a year, it has kept up its end of the baragain fairly ok.  The car does have occasional minor problems (ie--exhaust leak, wipers stopped working, driver side lock doesn't work, automatic seatbelts are quirky) but mechanically it runs well.  The GL only packs a 110HP 4-banger (the LX and GT both have much more powerful engines) but it gets the job done, with mediocre performace.  The mileage is above average--anywhere from 20MPG for lots of city driving in the high 20s/low 30s for long drives.

The trunk has a fairly large amount of space, and the rear seats fold down for extra storage.  (However there is no trunk release which is sort of annoying).  The front seats are pretty comfortable, but the rear seats I can only recommend for small children (unless you're making a trip under 20 miles).  Another little problem area is the windows.  The roll down windows (just 2 of them) have no frame on top. This is kinda nice, however because of this, it has a tendency not to rollup all the way, and sometimes I have to open the door and pull up on the window to get it to go up that final quarter inch. 

Because of it's small size and weight distribution, the 1990 Ford Probe handles really well.  In fact it's one of its strongest points.  This car can rip around a corner with amazing agility--even with only 14&quot; tires.

<b> Conclusion </b>

All things considered, this car has done pretty well and doesn't have to  last much longer.  It does have its share of annoying problems--but these have all been minor issues, and don't involve the drivetrain.  It's a perfect sized car for a college student (great for parallel parking--even for beginners) and the price tag is pretty cheap.  The car is reliable, fun to drive and a good value for your dollar.<br><br>
