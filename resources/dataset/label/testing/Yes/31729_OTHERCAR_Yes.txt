            Great looking design - very sporty looking car. I find the seats very comfortable.  It has a surprisingly very large trunk.  My only complaint is that you cannot see the tail end of the car through the back window and that makes it hard to judge to parallel park, however the steering is amazingly maneuverable.  I may not be able to see my back end, but I can maneuver this into parking spots so much easier than the Olds 88 that I used to own.  It is great on gas. I've only owned this 6 month and it has never been in the shop except for an oil change.  It runs like a charm and handles great.  Front bucket seats are roomy and comfortable and the gear shift is a comfortable feel between the seats.  The back seats seat 3 easily with plenty of leg room.  Air conditioner works great with easy to figure out controls.  Steering wheel adjusts easily.
