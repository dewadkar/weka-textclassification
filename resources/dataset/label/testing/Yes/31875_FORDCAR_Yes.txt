            Well...

Ford Escort...I bought a demo model in 1997, it had 15,000 miles on it, and my wife wanted it, it was affordable, so....we bought it.  I know, I know, you say &quot;c'mon a Ford Escort?&quot;, remembering the old &quot;Ford Escort World Car&quot; I had one in 1981, one of the first years. It had the WORST underpowered engine with the worst automatic transmissions I had driven to date...I went to Nissan for many happy years...I would never go back....or would I?

I drove the car, I thought..this feels in the front end like a tight Japanese car, like a Toyota or Mazda (I like Mazda), till I found out that this Ford, had more Mazda in it than Detroit Ford. Comfortable, stable, predictable performance, and GLORY HALLELUIA....THE FRONT END ALLIGNMENT STAYED IN ADUSTMENT!!! WOO HOOOOO!!!!!

I now have 86,000 miles on it and use for work myself, great car, no service except for a replaced pulley on the fan belt (bearing went out).  Before spending the extra money on a Toyota, or Mazda, et all, take a look at this little car.  

Gas mileage with the automatic, air, 4 door sedan has been 28-34 miles per gallon, and I did add automatic transmission fluid to my fuel for 2 tanks of gas under advice from my mechanic to straighten out a spark knock in the engine. Oh, bye the way, the engine is VERY peppy for a little 2.0, much, much better than the Chevy Caviler, or the Toyota Corola.

Good car, comfortable ride, easy to park in the lot, and very reliable, what more could you want in a sub compact?<br><br>
