            I got this car to go to college in, I have had it 4 years and have put 65,000 miles on it.  I have kept the oil changed religiously and have never had to put it in the shop.  This car has been so reliable, it has never failed me on my 6 hour trips from college to home.  It has great power and hugs the road beautifully.  It get's great gas mileage, I can fill up when I leave to go home and not have to get gas until the next day after I arrive home.  The sunfire rides smoothly and has good brakes.  The car is very roomy, the front seats are large, and the back seat is very comfortable, very spacious.  The only drawback are that the car is very noisy, the dashboard rattles and the windows leak air, but I just drown it out with loud music.  I would defintly recommend this car to anyone, wanting a good reliable car.<br><br>
