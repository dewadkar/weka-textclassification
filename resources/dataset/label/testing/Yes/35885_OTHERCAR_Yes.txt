            Yes, I name my possessions, and I affectionately name my Jeep the "Red Thunder."  Why?  Because it's red, and it thunders down the road.  Easy enough!

This car is a great vehicle for any use.  I'm a very avid skier and outdoors-man, and this baby can haul any of my skiing or hiking equipment with ease.  It can also accomidate a trailer hitch on the back.

A thing to note about this car is that if you're stingy with gas, this sure isn't the car for you.  It loves its gas. Although its gas consumption isn't horrible, it's not terrific either.

Furthermore, this car is physically smaller than the Grand Cherokee, and I've driven both.  I've noticed that the Sport handles better and it's easier to maneuver than its larger cousin.

The seats in this car are also a little harder than normal, and the car produces a little more noise than the Grand Cherokee, but the ride is overall comforable, and it's a pleasure to drive.

Guys, this car's a girl (we must be PC, right?) magnet.

Gals, guys will love this car.
