            I bought my sentra after i had it with my Mitsubishi Galant.  i looked at several types of cars, and finally decided to go to a Nissan dealer.  i had seen the Sentra on TV, and thought &quot;what the hay.&quot; so i went to the dealer and looked at the car.  i drove it and loved it.  i did however had to settle for the GXE model.  i on the other hand am very impressed with the performance of the little thing.  the gas mileage is what makes me love this car so much.  i bought it in May of 2000, and it is now November, and my odometer reads 20,000 miles.  completely trouble free and very comfortable ones at that.  in my last car i had trouble with the support of the front buckets, and had to stop alot when on long trips, no i can drive this one till i need gas and not get uncomfortable.  i love my little car, and look forward to putting 200,000 miles on it before i get rid of it.  i highly recommend this car to anyone looking at it....it is a great piece of machinery.
