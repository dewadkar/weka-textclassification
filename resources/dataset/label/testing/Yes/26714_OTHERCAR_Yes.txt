            I bought this camera because I wanted to take some skateboarding pictures and I thought that it would be very helpful to use the picture screen to delete the unwanted pictures. I paid $300, which is pretty good for what I got.

It took me a day-or-so to completely figure out all the little options this camera offers and the controls are fairly simple. You can control the flash and if the flash is on it doesn't create any red-eye when taking pictures of people. 

Image quality is, in my opinion, exceptional. Very bright and colorful. 

Like other digital cameras this thing EATS batteries, you can't even make it through an entire 36 exposures on 4 Duracell AA Batteries. Solution: Rechargable batteries. Buy rechargable batteries! They cost like $15 (4 AA batteries and charger) and they last for like 500 recharges, think of how much MONEY YOU SAVE. And they're still as powerful each charge. 

Here's my problem, though. I planned on using this camera to take pictures of myself and friends skateboarding... If you plan on using this camera for things like sports or anything else the requires a fast shutter speed you're going to be very disappointed. The shutter speed is very slow and that causes alot of problems for me while I try to take pictures of people skateboarding. I have to catch them right in the air, or right in the middle of a flip trick and that requires a quick shutter.

Another problem is that there is no zoom. There is something like a 2x zoom but that does nothing. 

If I were to buy another digital, I would buy one with a zoom and fast shutter. If this camera had those it'd be perfect.
