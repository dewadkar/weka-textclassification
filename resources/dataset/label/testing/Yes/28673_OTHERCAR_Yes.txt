            The 1995 Chrysler LeBaron GTC convertible is a good looking, very quick, and fun-to-drive car. We bought this car as a second car for my wife, who really wanted a convertible, but my budget couldn't afford more than about $6,000.
We were fortunate to find a used one locally, and the owners seemed anxious to sell, since they had two other cars, and lived in an apartment complex with limited parking. The only downside was that the car had some minor front-end cosmetic damage, which I knew I could repair. The car only had 68,000 miles.
The car is nicely equipped, with leather seats, and power everything, in a nice compact package. With the top down, and the boot in place, it really looks very sporty.
The car is basically the last of the Chrysler k-cars- which Chrysler began building in the early 80's. So by the time they built the 95 LeBaron convertible, all the bugs had been completely worked out. The engine is strong and torquey, the transmission smooth, and the steering precise and light. The engine is a v-6, which provides a lot of power for such a small car. Surprisingly, the car gets very good mileage, well over 20mpg around town. The power top works smoothly and easily, with a built in glass rear window that makes rearward vision as good as in a regular coupe. The headliner in the convertible is also quite nice, with velcro strips holding the headliner in place when the top is up, for a finished look that is much nicer than many convertibles with exposed bars and mechanisms.
As a bonus, the car is also very easy to work on. The engine compartment is accessible, and I was able to do an oil change and change the spark plugs and distributor cap/rotor all in one afternoon. 
On the downside, the trunk is quite small, with a lot of what would have been trunk space taken up by the convertible top mechanism and storage well. You will have trouble getting two sets of golf clubs in this trunk.
For around town, this is a great little car, that's fun to drive, and available at a good price.
