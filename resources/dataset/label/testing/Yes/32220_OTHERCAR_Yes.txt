            My wife researched the heck out of this one before we bought it used in 1997.  It has a unique 5 cylinder engine with plenty of pep and great control on the road.

If you get one of these cars, make sure you get the optional motorized sun roof and definitely get the spoiler on the back.  The spoiler makes the car look 100% different than the other Vigor's on the road.  I still have people say, 'That is a really nice car, what is it!'  

The car does have a few setbacks.  The first is that it has no cup holders.  Also, we have found that the car really benefits from expensive tires on the front like Yokohamma's or Eagle's.  Without them the car can be a little slippery up front.  Lastly, you will need to fill the tank with medium grade gas.  

Other than routine maintenance, we have not had any problems with the car.  The four doors are handy when having to move a few extra passengers but the rear leg room is not for 6 footers on for really long trips.  The leather interior is very nice and comfortable.

If you are looking for a reliable, sporty, yet practical vehicle, this is a perfect choice.  It looks great and still commands looks.  A well maintained Vigor should last a long time!<br><br>
