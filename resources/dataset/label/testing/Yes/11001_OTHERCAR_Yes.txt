            We bought a '92 Astro because we wanted to separate our kids while driving. That was in '93, 7 years and well over 100,000 miles ago.  The seats, carpet, heating and cooling, inside and outside lights, brakes and other major systems have held up well. It can take a hit - it is on its third rear bumper, with no other damage from those two incidents. Upon removing the two rear seats, lots of cargo room is revealed for moving a household across town, a student to college, or 50 cinder block from the warehouse. On the other hand, the coolant sensor corroded out twice (we knew the symptoms the second time around!), the GM Bright White paint peeled off of the hood in sheets (and off of various parts of all the white Astros in town), the middle bench seat outside seat belt is dangerously uncomfortable because of poorly angled ceiling connection, both middle and rear bench seats are difficult to adjust and are short on leg room, the front passenger seat has no leg room at all, the driver's (plastic) outside door handle broke, and the left radio speaker doesn't work very well. I am also getting too old for climbing up so high so get in. We plan to keep the Astro until we have paid off the loans we took out against it to redecorate our house.  Then, a real car again.<br><br>
