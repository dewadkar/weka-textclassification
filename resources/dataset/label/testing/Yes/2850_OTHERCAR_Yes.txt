            the new honda prelude SH is good everyday car.i think of it as the luxury
side of an integra vtec.the ride is smoother,quieter but due to the active torque transfer technology,this car handles great,maybe better than
a integra.accleration is decent with good torque and high rpm vtec power.the vtec profile is much diffrent than a integra also.the integra's
vtec is a screaming,never ending power pull,where the prelude's vtec range isnt as mean.it seem to be there to really just help the heavy car keep accleration going,not feeling acceleration increase as with a type-R.
mid 15 second 1/4 mile time are the average stock times.because of the weight of the car,it doesnt feel like 195hp,even the 170hp integra edges out the prelude in the 1/4 running low 15's.the prelude is really about 
quality,comfort,style.those wanting the car for performance can have their cake and eat it too.companies like Drag and Fmax make great turbo kits for these vechicles and expect awesome power output.it's very easy to
attain 300hp with one these turbo kits and run the 1/4 mile in the 13's.
i think its a great dual purpose car and the sticker prices wont cost a 
arm and a leg.<br><br>
