            Back a few months ago, my jalopy of car died on me and I was left without wheels.  Quite a difficult thing for a 21 year old guy.  So I sat down with my mom and step dad and told them what I wanted.  The first thing they said is that I needed to set a price range of no more then $20,000.  The first thing that popped into my mind was getting a Honda Civic.  The first time I ever drove one was my friends 1995 model.  So within a week and a half of going to the Honda dealer, I drove away in my brand new 2000 Honda Civic LX.  The price isn't the only reason I bought the car, it wasn't even the main reason I bought it.  My friend let me drive his Civic all the time and I loved it.  It wasn't the fastest car but it was quick enough for me, spacious, nice ride, everything you could look for in a car.  What I love about this car?  One word:  EVERYTHING.  Since I have only had it for a month I really haven't found anything that I hate about it.  It's such a nice car.  The car handles fairly well for a car in its class.  Driving it is amazing.  The acceleration is decent, top speed is ok, handles good like I said.  If you are on a limited budget and you are looking for a new car, I strongly suggest getting a Honda Civic.  If you are a teenager or young adult that likes to modify cars for racing or shows, the Civic is positively the best car to do this to.  I have seen my share of Civics that just looked absolutely beautiful.  If you are looking for a car with a stock top speed of 130 or more then this car is not for you.  Sorry folks :-(<br><br>
