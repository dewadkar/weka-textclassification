            Upon receiving a gift certificate to an on line store, I chose the Umax Astracam 1000. This one did not come with the charger, voice recorder, etc. It DID come with batteries,USB cord, and incredible software. It's the perfect point and shoot digital camera; weighs under four ounces! The software is easy to learn to use. Although the camera does have exposure settings (4 of them) the software allows you to change settings after the picture has been transferred to the computer. Now that's a nice touch.
This camera should be available for about $100 soon. Go get one, but don't forget: It's a snapshot camera. Quality is far from the best.
