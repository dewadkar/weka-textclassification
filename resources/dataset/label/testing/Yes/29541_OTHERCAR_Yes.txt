            I got the DC240 as a Christmas gift, and was immediatly impressed.  As soon as I took it out of the box, it was smooth sailing.  It is VERY simple to use and the menu system on the screen is awesome. Some of the great features this camera boasts are: 3x optical zoom, built-in flash, rechargable NiMH batteries, several flash modes, self timer, and redeye reduction.  The included USB cord makes uploading your pictures very easy and very quick.  This camera takes high quality pictures, at a fairly reasonable price.  Printed out on photo paper, it is almost hard to tell the difference between digital pictures taken with this camera and photos developed at your local photo mart.
