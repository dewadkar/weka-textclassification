            Are you looking for a sporty car with all the amenities for a price that will not break the bank?  Look no further than a used Nissan Maxima (SE).  I bought a 1992 SE with under 60,000 miles on it 2 years ago and it is sweet!  It is the perfect car for someone right out of college that wants to use their money for things other than a $30,000 car.  I have had no problems with my car.  It is full leather, sun roof...the whole nine yards.  I was one of those people that thought that when they finally got THE job, they should buy the car of their dreams.  Well, by doing a little research, I got a great car at a reasonable price.  My parents bought a 93 Maxima GLE at the same time and they love theirs too!  The SE is my favorite because it has tight steering.  The GLE is much looser (too loose for my taste)  It is more of a &quot;parent&quot; car while the SE is much sportier.  The SE also has a nice v-6 vtec for more power.  All of your friends and family will also fit nicely into this roomy car.  I found my car through a classified ad (which is a good way to go if you want a great price and know what you are looking for).

Get 'em while you can.  The older models are Hot and usually sell as soon as the classified is run!  I was in a bidding war for mine and it was the same day it was in the paper!<br><br>
