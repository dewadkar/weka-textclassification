             About 5 years ago I was in the market for a small car for my girlfriend(now my wife). We looked at many cars and wanted something small, with some pep. I found a add for a place that sells wrecked cars and called them on a nissan, at that time there was a Geo Storm in back with a crunched front end, so I asked about it and the dealer said it was $1,000, so I bought it. We spent another $900 on parts and the Storm was on the road.
 
 The Storm looks very much like the Isuzu Impulse and is very much the same car. The engine in the Storm is made by Isuzu and built on the Impulse platform. One thing the Impulse has over the Storm is a better Lotus suspension and more h.p.
 
 I really liked this car and was very impressed with the handling and power it had. The little 1.6 liter has decent power with the Storms 2,292 pound curb weight. The fuel economy is fantastic(I averaged 34 miles to the gallon) and I always used cheap regular unleaded gas. The shifter was like driving a go kart and always went into gear, it also made the storm fun to drive(I had the 5 speed). With 95 horsepower and 97 lbs of torque, I never thought a car could feel this peppy. The front wheel drive was well suited for the car and never tried to pull the wheel from your hands.

 There is a lot of wind noise when driving and you can easily hear the engine. The 4 way struts help take the jar out of the road and rides rather nice. I also liked the brakes and they were always quiet and stopped well. Being the car is so light, it was easy to get blown around the road during very windy days.

 The interior of the Storm was pretty bland and cheap looking. Some of the heater knobs would fall off regularly and the interior material was cheap. the back seats were pretty small and a person over 5 foot tall cannot sit in the back comfortably without having to bend their head sideways to not hit the rear hatch glass and knees were very cramped. There is not a lot of room in these little Storms at all.

 My Storm was the base model and everything was manual(nothing electric). The 93 Storm did have a drivers airbag and air conditioning as a option. Mine did have a cassette player/radio, but that was the extent of it.

 I feel the Storm is a very reliable car and will give most people many years of reliable transportation. There is one thing to note: trying to find body parts can be expensive and almost impossible to find. The front end cover(a big piece of flexible plastic) was $500 used and I had to get it from Arizona.

 If you have more than two people in your family I don't recommend this car to anyone, unless everyone in the family is under 4 foot 11. For a car to get back and forth to work or a single person this could be an ideal car.<br><br>
