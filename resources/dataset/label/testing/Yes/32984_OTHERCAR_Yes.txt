            The  Toyota  Camry is  one  of  the most  competent  cars on  the  road. My  1997  LE  model  has just  over 35,000  miles  and has never  needed  
any type  of  unusual  repairs  or servicing.  The  ride  one  gets is solid  and  smooth.  Over  bumpy  roads  or  railroad  tracks its  a  little  stiff  but overall  comfortable. The  rear  seat  handles  3 average  adults fairly  comfortably.  The  engine  and drive  train  are  well  matched  with  plenty  of power  for  easy  movement  in  a busy  highway   environment. The  4 cylinder  engine  gets  great mileage ( 25 MPG, city; 34 MPG Highway) and  is  not  very noisy.  The exterior  has held  up  well with  no  rust  spots  to  date.  The  interior  is  convenient  with  everything  that  is  essential   within  easy  reach. I bought the  vehicle  due to the  many glowing  reports  I saw  in  Consumer Reports magazine  and  since  every  Camry  owner  I  know  has kept  their  car  a  long time.  Anyone  looking  for a  dependable and  reliable  vehicle  with little  upkeep  needed will  find  the Toyota Camry a  very smart choice. This  is  not  a car for  a large  family  but  a  good starter  for a  new  family.         <br><br>
