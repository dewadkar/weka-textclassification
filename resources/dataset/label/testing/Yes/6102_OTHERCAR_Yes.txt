            I have been driving the 2000 Chevrolet Impala for the past six months.  I can honestly say that this vehicle offers a superb ride in almost every way.  The 3.8L V-6 engine offers plenty of power when it is needed.  The suspension system in the car affords the driver and passengers comfort along with smoothness.

  The stereo system is more than adequate.  I have cassette and CD with controls not only on the dash but also on the steering wheel.  Also, the stereo system headquarters the controls and alarms for engine repair, security system, etc.  The car is equipped with a GPS system, outside temperature gauge and mileage indicators which can be useful.  The dash on the car houses all the normal gauges along with an indicator which alarms for low fuel, engine trouble, low tire pressure, etc.  It comes with standard safety including Daytime Running Lights, child safety locks, tinted solar glass and rear child seat tethers.  I have leather bucket seats which are equipped with heaters that come in handy during cold weather. 

 Trunk space is very large and can be accessed from the rear seat which folds down.  Fuel mileage seems to be around 20 miles a gallon which is probably normal for the larger V-6 motor.  The one negative that comes to mind with the car is that the rear of the vehicle seems to sit higher than normal.  When backing up or in reverse it feels as though that you cannot adequately see out the back window.

  All in all I would recommend the 2000 Impala as a new car purchase.  Chevrolet has many options on this vehicle that you only find on more expensive models.  I really as though you could not go wrong choosing the 2000 Chevrolet Impala as your next car.<br><br>
