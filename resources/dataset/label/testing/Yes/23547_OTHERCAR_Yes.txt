            Well, the 1990 Range Rover had served it's purpose, as well as lined the pockets of the local dealership for frequent (and costly) repairs.  The things I truly loved about the Rover were that I could drive it practically anywhere my eyes could see and it was a unique vehicle.  Now that I'm a little older and have little mouths to feed, the time has come to find a suitable replacement.  I'll post an opinion later on the Rover for more information . . .

This is a third vehicle for us, and will be used on the weekends and for family drive trips.  I reviewed all of the available SUV's that had material size, starting with the Jeep/Blazer size and up.  The Suburban seemed to fit the bill, with a combination or size, comfort, luxury touches and reasonable cost (at least when compared with others in it's class . . .).  To capitalize on the packaged feature approach, I selected the LT trim line.  Not needing heavy towing capabilities I selected the 1500 version (as compared to the heavier duty 2500).  As we do like to drive on the beach from time to time I selected the 4WD version.  

One of my requirements is rear controls for HVAC and audio.  My wife is more sensitive to fluctuations in heat/cold and I'm tired of continually adjusting the temp and fan speed, especially on long trips. This is standard on the LT, as long as you do not have a sunroof (the wring goes in the &quot;ceiling&quot;).

When I began this journey back in May of this year the 2000 Suburban was in high demand and low supply.  There were fewer than 10 on lots within 75 miles of our home and only 2 were LT's.  Neither had the required rear control feature.  All of the dealers were expecting their final allotment of 2000's at the end of June, half of the allotments were already sold and they could not do a custom order, so I decided to wait and order a 2001 model.

I placed the order in mid July and took delivery last week.  The vehicle is everything I expected, and then some.  The ride is great and it corners much better than I would expect from such a large vehicle with a high center of gravity.  All of the comfort and convenience features are excellent.  It had been nearly 20 years since I purchased an American name plate vehicle and I was surprised by the apparent high quality of the fit and finish of the vehicle.

The &quot;and then some&quot; is the size.  It looked big, it drove big, but it parked in my garage even bigger!  It barely fits the width of my garage door and I have to fold in the driver's mirror to get in the door.  The size has benefits though if you have to carry other people.  I drove it to work one day (gotta show off the new toy . . .) and volunteered to drive to lunch, seating 8 of us.  One of the passengers in the 3rd seat is large (6'2&quot; and 225 lbs) who owns an Expedition.  He said that the third seat is roomier and more comfortable than the 2nd seat on his Expedition.  Everyone else said the ride was great!

Thus far there is only one problem.  The enhanced audio system with rear control was not installed, just the &quot;regular&quot; radio/tape/CD.  Chevy/GM somewhere along the way changed the specs that this is an optional feature with the LT, even thought the dealer still shows it as standard on their ordering system.  The dealer is working it out with GM and I'm sure they will resolve it to my satisfaction.

The vehicle is actually in the shop now to have some after market items added (vcr/video and a CD changer) so I have driven it very little, but I'll keep you posted.<br><br>
