            Last week I had a chance to thoroughly test my father's newly acquired 95 Seville STS with the Northstar Engine. 

Lissen whut I say: This is NOT your usual Daddy's Cadillac!

I got the first glimpse of the car when he picked me up from the airport with it and just to look at it when its in motion is a sight not to be missed. It just looks like its born to burn up the road, right down to these four exhaust ports sticking out in the rear -and it doesn't disappoint you when you actually try. 
You will miss the tire smoking 'punch' a venerable big block delivers, but the car is extremely fast by any standards and it has something not usually associated with American cars: Roadholding. 
I had it up to 120 mph on German Autobahns and it gives you the feel of total control even at these speeds. There is no rolling or wobbling, nor does it feel 'light' like so many other cars. Amazingly, this stableness is not sacrificed by any lack of comfort. The steering gives you a 'feel' at any speed and pssst, lissen: no wind noise, even at 120. 
The car feels a little nose heavy on twisting country roads, but that is something you would expect from a fwd car of this heft. 

That legendary engine (now I know why it is praised so much) never ever sounds stressed, regardless at which speed you nail the throttle, and believe me, you do this a lot with total confidence. 
Don't worry, the car has the brakes to boot and not these 'push and wonder' binders of yore. 

There is nothing wrong with the ergonomics either, Cadillac even copied the foolproof seat adjusting controls from Mercedes (sorry, DaimlerChrysler) but they feel a little bit 'cheaper' than the originals. Cadillac finally did away with this fussy array of 'gold teeth' poking out of the armrest somewhere. The seat adjusting is just something else. I really liked the adjustable lumbar support and really everybody should be able to find a comfortable, yet firm, seating position. 

The leather is sumptuous and the carpet like you expect it to be in a Cadillac. Fit and finish is light years better than it was just ten years ago. I don't have a clue what that wood really is, but it sure does look good. 
Instruments are easy to read and the controls in logical, easy to reach positions. Only that multi-function stick poking out to the left of the steering column still gives you that brittle and clumsy feel it always did in any American car.
The only other weak point (at least in my opinion) that I found in the car, is the trunk lock. It is that nice power operated one, that pulls the lid close after you ever so gently pushed it into proximity of the closed position, but why does it have to be so far away from the edge of the trunk? Just imagine what it does to a jacket or something you erroneously threw over it. It practically renders the rear five inches of the trunk useless.
Would I buy this car nevertheless? You bet -if I could afford it. But I'd still keep my old Imperial to occasionally still be able to experience that 'American-Car-Feel' of times past -for nostalgic reasons. That Seville completely did away with it and Cadillac seriously proved that it is still capable to set what it always did: 

The Standard of the World! What else do you need?<br><br>
