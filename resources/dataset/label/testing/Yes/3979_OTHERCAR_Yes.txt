            I bought the car about 2 months ago.   The dealer was good, but they
seemed a little too over-friendly and agreeable.   Well, at least the
salesperson I spoke with did. (Saturn of Minneapolis)   I still wish
there had been a loaded LS2 *minus* the spoiler available.  Oh well,
it's better than waiting a month for it to be custom built and delivered.

The only problem I've encountered so far with the car is the key fob.
The first week I had the car I had just parked my car at work and forgot
my 12-pack of Cherry Coke. I turned back and had already &quot;armed&quot; the car.  
The key fob stopped working completely.   So I opened the door - the
alarm (horn) went off and I put the keys in the ignition to acc. on to
disarm it..  Later I removed the battery and put it back in and it
worked fine.   This seems to be a common problem from what I've heard,
but far from severe.

I've also heard about engine recalls, but they don't seem to affect the
majority of the cars they've made.

It has about 3100 miles on it at the moment.  I drove it from Minneapolis
to Chicago (about 400 miles) a month ago.  (about a 9 hour trip out there
 -- the roads were bad with snow in southern wisconsin, and a little under
7 on the way back)   The seats are extremely comfortable -- though I wish
I could say the same for the shoes I was wearing on my way out there.

The stereo in this car is very nice.   (The 8 speaker w/amp CD/Cass
system)   I sometimes feel like sitting down in my car to listen to
music since it makes my home stereo sound like c r a p.

The only thing I don't like about the car so far is the gas tank.  They
apparently took the gas tank they were throwing on the SL series and
threw it on the LS series, not taking mileage into consideration.  13.1
gallons is hardly anything.   They seem to have corrected this in the
2001 model of the car.

The LS2 is also only available with an automatic transmission which
some people don't like.  I would have purchased an automatic either
way.

Also, the ceiling portion near the sunroof opening seems really flimsy.
There is also the fake wood which some people don't like very much.

I really like the feel of the car too.  Quite a bit different than
driving my Cadillac DeVille. :)

If you are considering purchasing a 2000 Saturn LS2, you might want
to wait for the 2001 model unless you'd like to spend more time
at the gas station.
