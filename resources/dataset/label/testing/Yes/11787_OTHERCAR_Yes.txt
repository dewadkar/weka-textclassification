            I did a lot of research before deciding on the Exilim EX-M2.  Having worked with both digital and 35mm cameras for years, I was aware of all the trade-offs. Sure, a 5 Megapixel camera with 10x Optical zoom would have been great, but I quickly realized I'd never have it with me for those unplanned spontaneous events.  And those tend to be my most treasured photos.  So when I saw the EX-S1 at the 2002 PCExpo in NY, I new I had found something special.

True, it was only a 1.3 megapixel camera, which was a bit of a show-stopper, but it would fit in my shirt pocket!  Luckily, the product was virtually unobtainable for many months, and by then the EX-M1 and later the EX-M2 came out.  The Ex-M2 is a 2 Megapixel camera, distinguished from the EX-S2 by its ability to record audio and play MP3 music through a wired remote control and earphones (supplied). 

About the camera:  Physically, the camera is the size of a credit card, and about .5" thick.  The lens housing protrudes a bit from the body.  Overall construction is quite good.  Button layout is ok, but I would have preferred the on-off button somewhat further from the shutter release.  Until I got used to it, I was continually shutting the camera off, just when I wanted to shot the photo!  The rocker switch takes some getting used to also;  you have to hit it dead-on to set your function - I often found myself changing settings instead of setting them.  

The camera comes with 12Mb of RAM, which it uses by default, unless a SD or MMC card is installed.  Then it uses the card.  Files may be copied from card to internal memory.  MP3 files are maintained on the card.  I was hoping to be able to upload jpg images from other sources to display on the camera, but they wouldn't.  A 128Mb card is good for about 120 hi res jpg's or 40 songs; I split my card down the middle.

About the MP3 player: It's good.  The wired remote is easy to use.  Volume is more than adequate, even on the subway. It has an LCD display which backlights when you select any function, and track name and number are displayed, as well as volume and mode.  Mode selections are single, replay single, and replay all; no random selection. The remote also shows battery life. It attaches to the same port as the docking station, so you can't charge the camera or transfer files while you are playing music.

About the display:  It's very crisp, but can be busy.  Shows picture number, quality, battery life, flash mode, date and time.  Not possible to disable info.  Can zoom in on saved photo.  No multi photo mode.  

About the pictures:  Very acceptable for a 2 Megapixel camera.  Fixed focus.  Sharp from about 2 feet to infinity. I've made 8 x 10's but 4 x 6's are much better.  Very good for emailing and web photos.  Saturation good.

About the flash:  What do you expect?  It's fast and small, so it's range and horsepower are very limited.  Maximum effective range was about 10 feet, but mostly, the photos were underexposed after about 6 feet.  Good enough though for portrait snapshots.

About the video:  320 x 240 with audio.  30 seconds per clip, about 10 seconds before the camera is ready to do it again.  Limit is memory.  About 3Mb per 30 sec.  Can go frame-by-frame on replay.  Fun for recording phone numbers or panning to show someone a view. 

And that's what this camera is about: Fun. Quick, easy, on-the-go shooting.  I keep it in my pocket, and use it alot.  It's fun, but it will never be my bread-and-butter camera.  If you are looking for a small, easy to use camera that is unobtrusive, this is it!  And people seem to love it!  Nobody turns me down when it comes to posing for this device!
