            I have used 35mm cameras in the past and some other digital cameras and the Kodak LS443 puts all those other ones to shame.  Once you start taking pictures then you will know what I'm talking about.  When you first download the pictures to your computer, you will be amazed at the picture quality and how vibrant the colors look. Also the camera comes with the docking station that makes the transfer of pictures very fast and easy.

Now for the review.

<b> Picture quality and memory </b>
First off, the picture quality.  The camera has three settings for picture quality.  At the highest setting the pictures are very close to what a regular 35mm film camera would do.  Also at this setting you can get some great 4 by 6 or 8 by 10 prints.  The specifications say you can get up to 20 by 30 prints but I have not tried those.  I think the recommended size is up to 11 by 14.  With those three sizes this camera is perfect for most users.  The highest setting of the camera is 4 mega-pixels, the second setting is 2.2 mega-pixels and the last setting is 1 mega-pixel.  I mostly used the 4 Mp setting when taking most of my pictures but I have used the 1 Mp setting when I want to send emails to people.  At the highest setting the pictures are about 1 megabyte in size so I would recommend buying a memory card of at least 128 MB.  I personally bought a 256 MB card and with that I can take over 200 pictures at the highest quality setting and about nineteen minutes of video in movie mode.  The difference in price between the 128 and the 256 MB card is not that much.  The actual specifications on how many pictures you can take depending on the card size can be seen at the Kodak site.

<b> Controls </b>

In some reviews that I read some people have said that the shutter button is spongy and it is hard to control.  This was not the case with me.  To get the camera to take the best pictures possible, you would hold down the shutter button half-way and then the camera would automatically set the focus and the flash settings.  When it does that then you just press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture.  Some people said that it takes a long time to auto focus but this is not the case.  The camera is ready to take the picture quite quickly.

The zoom is quite good.  I just recommend that you don't use the digital aspect of it, only the optical.  I took a few pictures using the digital zoom and the picture quality dropped off somewhat.

The camera operates in several modes.  The only one that I haven't used yet is the night mode so I cannot comment on it but all the other modes do exactly what they say they can do.  For example, my little nephew was running around, so I put the camera in sport mode and the pictures came out great.  Very focused with no blurring.  This is another thing that other people have complained about and I don't see why.  That is why the camera has all these different modes, so you can get the best pictures during different situations.

The camera also has a lot of manual controls for setting up the exposure, white balance, where to focus, ISO and other things so there is a lot of stuff that novice picture takers can play around with.  Most of the time I have the camera set in automatic mode, but to get all the other features to work right you just have to experiment and take pictures in different conditions to see what works best.  The manual guide of the camera explains each function pretty well so you can pick up all the features pretty quickly.

Every time you switch to a new mode, there is a quick explanation of what it does so this makes the camera very easy to operate.

<b> LCD </b>
One of the cons of this camera is the LCD.  First of all the picture quality in the LCD is not good at all.  When I took a few pictures I thought they were all coming out bad when I viewed them using the review feature of the camera.  The photos don't look clear and the colors look a bit off.  That is a different case when you see the pictures on a computer.  Then you can really see what the camera can do.  Also, I was taking some pictures outdoors, and you can barely see the image on the LCD screen.  Also at night you can't see anything on the screen.  It would have been nice if they would have added controls to the LCD screen to change the contrast or the brightness to adjust to these conditions.  These drawbacks are not that bad and can be overlooked because of the picture quality of the camera.
