            I purchased the Sony Mavica Camera Model #71 about 12 months ago.  This camera to me is truly unique.  I take my pictures and if I do not like what I see (in the camera) I can delete the shot immediately.  I can take up to 40 pictures on a regular 3.5 diskette.  The pictures are truly great and sharp as a tack.  After I have finished taking pictures I can work on them on my computer.  I know exactly what I have and can improve them to a certain degree.  When printed on glossy paper the pictures are the best I have ever taken.  I have taken pictures at weddings, birthdays, golf outings and luncheons.  Maybe I have been lucky but I have not had a bad picture.  The only drawback to this camera is that it is easily set on taking pictures for e-mail and when this is done you only get about 28 pictures because of the programming necessary to send e-mail.  The price of the camera was a little high but I have found out it was worth it.  The newer models take about 60 seconds of movie pictures and I understand they also take sound.  I cannot give an opinion on the newer models because I have never seen one up close.<br><br>
