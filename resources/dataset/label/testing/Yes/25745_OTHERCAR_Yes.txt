            Ever since I learned to drive in one of the old beetles, I've wanted one, but by the time I could afford one, they no longer manufactured it.  When it was announced that they were back but re-designed, I looked forward to it with some apprehension.  Then I heard they were coming out with the turbo and I got real excited but I needed to test drive it first to see if it would be worth waiting for.  To make a long story short, I went back the next day, traded in my Saturn and drove off the lot with my 1999 New Beetle.  The drive and handling was responsive and the car itself is solid.  Very solid.  I've had people over 6' riding in the back so the back seat is not really an issue, and the front seats are comfortable enough for a long drive.  The road noise is minimal and all the safety features a real plus.  The sound from the radio and CD is very good.  I've had it now for almost a year and am still in love with and not disappointed.<br><br>
