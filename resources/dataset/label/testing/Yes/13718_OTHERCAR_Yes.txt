            First of all, let me say that the 1999 BMW 328i is a tremendous car.  I think there are very few cars that compare to it in terms of quality, beauty, ride, and overall solidity.  Having owned the car since April of 1999, I have had the chance to really understand and appreciate it's good qualities.  And, as a long-time BMW owner (this is my third - a 2002 and a 1988 535is preceded this one) I have a long familiarity with the BMW sports sedan.  And that's where the &quot;but...&quot; comes in.  As great a car as it is, I think it lack a certain, I don't know, &quot;feel&quot; that was present in both of my previous cars.  To be truthful, both the 2002 and the 535is models are considered classics and are still highly sought after in the used car market despite their age.  I think what I am saying is that this 1999 328i, as good as it is, doesn't quite get there.

By now you probably have figured I'm a bit of a car buff.  That is true.  However, I am also a sober, MBA educated, high-tech startup executive who loves to accelerate out of a turn.  So that's where I come from.

OK -- to the car.  To be specific, my car has both the premium and sports packages, in addition to the heated seats and an in-dash cd player.  Black, with tan leather sports seats.

Pros -- and there are a lot!  Beautiful car -- the new body style is a great improvement over the previous.  Great interior -- well laid out, nice wood touches, great leather.  Most comfortable seats I've ever had (the bolstered sports seat are incredibly supportive and the heaters work very quickly and well).  The car handles extremely well -- very tight and well-mannered.  Decent pickup.  Great BMW service plan and warranty.  No problems at all with the car except for 2 recalls early on (quickly fixed by the dealer), auto-sensor windshield wipers that sometimes think it is raining when it isn't (but you can always just turn them off -- hasn't been a big deal), and, maddeningly, floor mats that bunch up under the pedals (no effective way to hold them in place - you'd think on a $35,000 car they'd hit that detail). 

Cons -- just a few, as I mentioned, and most related to drivability.  In general, I think the car is a little underpowered.  It could perhaps use both a little more low-end oomph, although it isn't bad.  However, in 3rd through 5th gears it really could use some more pull -- mashing the pedal down to pass or to get onto the highway really doesn't do much.  Another nitpick -- the clutch flywheel must be really heavy, because there is definitely inertia to overcome in the shifts.  This makes shifts smooth but acceleration into the next gear perhaps a little leaden.  Finally, cruising at 75MPH in 5th gear puts you at 3000 RPM, which in my mind is working a little too much -- 2500 would be more like it.  Finally, a few little rattles which drive me nuts (I'm a musician and have sensitive ears).

So to summarize, I really like this car, and I know that a lot of people do as well.  I really can't complain.  It's just that...I guess it doesn't elicit the passion that my old 2002 and 535is once did.  Maybe it's a little too smooth, a little too muted, a little too nice?  If you are looking for a really nice smallish sports sedan you'll love it -- I really think there are few to no other cars that can compare on the road today.  If you are a BMW enthusiast, though, perhaps you'll understand what I mean.  I guess what I really wish is that BMW would bring a 4-door new body-style M3 to the States.  That's the solution, although it's not for everybody.
