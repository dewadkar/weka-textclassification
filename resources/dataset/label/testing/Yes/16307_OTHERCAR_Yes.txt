              I have been selling digital cameras for some time now at a leading office supply store. The HP C200 is giving the other high dollar digital cameras a run for their money. An added extra is their P1000 printer which is a great sidekick for printing the photos with or without a PC present!
  The Hewlett Packard C200 digital camera is so easy to use, even I could just pick it up and go...without 14 manuals to carry along with me. I didn't even need a private tutor to figure out the how to use this camera. The main selling point I encountered was the printer that was designed by HP to print these digital photos, the Hewlett Packard P1000 Photosmart printer. A very impressive pair at a reasonable price. The HP C200 digital camera has a 8MB CompactFlash card/ removable, holding up to 80 pictures depending on how fine of resolution chosen. 
  The other leading digital cameras do however have a higher resolution at a higher price, making this camera a great family choice for most. The resolution options may warrant a second look for the more serious camera techies who are doing photography on a professional basis. The HP P1000 PhotoSmart printer is however a great choice for those who would like to print their digital photos without transferring their data/pictures to their hard drives. 
  Overall a great family camera or for those who want to just get started in the Digital Photography hobby!<br><br>
