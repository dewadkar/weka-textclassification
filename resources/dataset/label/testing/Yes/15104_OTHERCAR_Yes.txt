            Ok.  Well I have a 1999 Nissan Altima and I recently got into an accident and the air bags did not come out.  it was a head on collision and the sensors we correct.  But no Air bags.  Everyone be carful and get your Nissans checked before the accident.  I had the tested and they were default.  It is ok now I am told.  But next time i'll have them tested first.  I like the car and it runs really great.  it is affordable and dependable.  Just check the airbags.  

This car is a great family car.  It takes us everywhere.  I am not saying it is a bad car.  Every car should be inspected.  But I just have seen this alot in Nissans.  And the service center refused to take any fault.

Everyone should stand behind there product good or bad<br><br>
