            For my wife's birthday back in April 1999 my mother in law went to her local Dodge dealer and picked out a real pretty purple Dodge Neon.  I was totally shocked that she would buy her daughter a car for she must really love her to do that.  As it turned out after the first couple of payments it was determined that I would make all of the rest......how that was decided is a long story in and of itself and not something I can write without throwing in a lot of hard feelings.

For about the first 15000 miles my wife drove the car and as far as things went she loved every mile.  About that time my 1990 Pontiac Bonneville slipped a cog and went down for the count and the neon was turned over to me.  Having only driven the thing for maybe 10 of its first 15000 miles I was very much against having to drive it.  All of those hard feelings getting in the way.  But having no choice because I had to somehow get to work everyday I grudgingly swallowed those hard feelings and took to the open road.

If you ask my wife all I ever did was complain about the Neon, but deep down inside the little car came to grow on me.  I drove it roughly 100 miles a day for over two years and in that time the only problem I had was the head gasket going out at 64000 miles.  It seems as if just about every Neon going back to 1995 had a problem with this but Dodge didn't feel obligated to issue a recall.  Four people I knew with Neons said the head gaskets went on them too.  Some with less miles than when mine went.  500 bucks later I was back on the road with nary a problem in sight.

I loved the interior of the car, everything was in reach and easily accessible.  The seats were comfortable both on the driver and passenger side, and that back seat had plenty of room for adults.  Usually is was just kids back there but it was good to know I could haul around a grown up or two.  The handling was very good and the ride was very nice.  Road noise was a small problem and when the wind blew the driver side window really howled.  The trunk was of average size but if I needed to haul something big the rear seats folded down.  

I put over 118,000 miles on my Neon and just recently traded it for a Ford Focus ZX3.  Why didn't I buy a new Neon you ask?   Well as much as I liked my Neon I decided to buy something different as a way to get rid of some of the hard feelings I had not dealt with.  I did test drive a 2002 Neon but decided that you just can't go home again.
