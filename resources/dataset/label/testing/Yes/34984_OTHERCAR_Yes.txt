            So you want to know how the Century stacks up against other Buicks?  Well, let me begin by saying that GM is the best domestic car company (in my epinion), and that Buick has the best dollar:features ratio of any GM car company.
Now that that is out of the way, you want to know what I think of my mother's '99 Century?  Simple.  It's not a LeSabre or a Park Avenue, but I still love it.
I drive it about 5 times a week, and do all the work on it... she bought it used, and the only thing I've had to do is fix the exhaust (minor pin hole) and reset her tire inflation monitor system.
This car, for a Buick, gives you, the driver, a wonderful amount of power for a relatively cheap amount of gas.  Now that prices on gas are rising and rising, it is important to note the fuel mileage.  The Century does not disappoint.
All Buick parts are relatively inexpensive, and they are simple to maintain.  They are also reliable - this car is no exception.
The interior is not like my Park Avenue... but it is more comfortable than many similar sized cars.  The seats support your back well for long drives, and there is plenty of room in the back seat.
When driving this car, there is a small amount of lag when he stomps on the gas.  This is most likely due to the smaller engine Buick chose to package with the Century.  But, it will still burn a lot of cars on the straight-away (even when over-taking on the highway).  And, contrary to popular belief, this car does not handle like a boat.  Nor does it handle like a racecar.  It handles like a family-class 4-door.
With a newer used Buick, you really can't go wrong.  Just make sure you get good records of your car, and keep up on the upkeep.  Thanks for reading!
