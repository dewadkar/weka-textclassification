            I wasn't really looking to buy a car this past February. However, I discovered that Uncle Sam wasn't going to claim an extra chunk of cash in April. At the time I was driving a 1996 Accord LX 4 door sedan (with a 5 speed, a big mistake). It was a great car, comfortable, great gas mileage, safe, and handled very well for a sedan. The only maintenance it ever required was oil changes and a set of brakes. 

A quick trip to my local dealer revealed that the 2000 models were roomier and an even better car than my old faithful 1996. I settled on a gold 2000 Accord SE. I was told that they don't make the SE model every year and I'm not sure if this is true. It is essentially an option pack at a very reduced price with a slightly different interior. The SE option is an Accord LX with an automatic transmission, power everything (like the regular LX), anti-lock brakes, alloy wheels, and a keyless entry anti-theft system. The overall sticker price was 22,215 (that's before the SE packages savings) the standard sticker price was 20,500. This isn't a bad price for everything you get. Remember these cards hold their value very very well. I traded in my 1996 with 138,000+ miles and still received 6000 for it, try that with another midpriced sedan with that much mileage. Granted I could have got more if I sold it outright but I didn't want to go through all that. The final price before my trade-in was 19,100, the discount was directly the result of information consumers can get on the web. Armed with the actual dealer cost info I was able to negotiate a price of just under $500 over their cost. 

So bottom line on this car is that its worth every penny. The new engine is smoother, quieter, more efficient and has almost 20 horsepower more that the LX I had previously. As for fuel economy it get about the same as my old LX did with a manual transmission. This car also handles better, probably due to the combination of the alloy wheels and tires that come with this model. The anti-lock brakes also make my morning Boston commute a little safer. The front wheel drive is pretty good in the snow as long as you watch your speed and its great to know that the abs system is there when you have to slow down in inclement weather.

This car has loads more interior room with larger back seats and an enormous trunk for a mid-sized sedan. The glove box is small but you have a 2 compartment center console to supplement that storage. The adjustable front seats are firm yet comfortable. The quality of the interior materials also feels superior to that of my wife's Toyota which is another great car.

If I had to do all over again I would definitely get this same car. The only downside to the SE model is that they only make it in 3 colors, gold, red, and green. 

Do your homework, get the financial numbers for your area, and test drive one. Its a great car and might but just what you are looking for.
