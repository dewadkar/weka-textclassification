            If you're on a limited budget, you can't do much better than an older Mercedes Diesel.  Mercedes are built to last, and even after 300,000, 400,000, or more miles, the Diesels roll down the highway in style.  For anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000, you can land one of these &quot;autos&quot; (don't you dare call it a car), and if you're like me, you'll never go back to standard cars.

The Mercedes Diesels suit a particular type of driver, so take a moment to consider whether or not this is the right vehicle for you.

----------

The Drive: Diesel engines are different from gas engines. Unlike gas engines, which use a spark plug to ignite the gas, diesel engines operate by compressing the fuel until it explodes without the aid of a spark plug.  To handle this high pressure, diesel engines are far sturdier than gas engines, and they are also more fuel efficient.  Here's what this translates to from a driver's perspective: diesel engines have very slow acceleration, but once they get moving, they cruise down the highway with the best of them.  I often find myself sailing by newer compact cars or other gas cars that are spinning their engines to keep pace.

The older Diesels are heavy cars, which means that you have a sturdy and solid ride.  Built before the days of aluminum and plastic, the Diesels rumble beneath you, and the bumpers can absorb just about any mid-range impact without visible damage.

The Diesels drive like first class autos, with an oversized steering wheel and phenomenal cornering capabilities.  The original brakes leave a little to be desired as compared to modern anti-lock systems.

The Diesels also get great gas mileage.  My 1981 240 model gets over 30 mpg on the highway, which is great considering the size of the car.

On a down side, the Diesels take time to wake up in the morning.  Older models will often take a minute or two to warm up before you can start them, and then they can often sputter for the first minute of driving.  Don't worry that it's something wrong with the car -- it's just the way of the Diesel.  Also, don't be alarmed by visible (and stinky) exhaust.  You're driving a truck engine, and that's what Diesels do.  California and other states offer grandfather clause exemptions to diesel vehicles for smog and emission requirements.  Sorry, folks!

----------

The Ride: You'll never escape the fact that these Mercedes are luxury cars.  The style of luxury -- leather interiors, walnut dash, and graceful curves -- never seems to go out of fashion, which is part of the appeal of these classic autos.  You can also sense that these cars were the top-of-the-line when they were built: you'll hear a solid &quot;whoomp&quot; when you shut the door, and even the original floor carpeting is still plush.  No sound from outside penetrates the cab of the Diesel, but you will find that the rumble of the engine throbs throughout your ride.

----------

How to Shop: In addition to looking for proof of regular maintenance records, etc., you'll want to check the &quot;engine compression&quot; to determine the condition of your Diesel.  As I mentioned before, diesel engines work by compressing the fuel until it explodes.  It's critical, then, that your engine is tight and doesn't have any pressure leaks.  If your engine compression is weak, you'll have trouble combusting the fuel and you'll have an inefficient and slow ride.  In order to check your engine compression, you need to do the following: 

1. Take your Diesel to the top of a hill and aim down
2. Turn off the car but leave it in 4th gear
3. Release the brake (and parking break) and see what happens.

IF your Diesel remains stationary, held by the engine, then you're in good shape.  But IF the Diesel begins to slip down the hill, you've got poor engine compression and you'll need to reconsider the purchase.

----------

I know it's easy to be skeptical of the Diesels -- after all, why would anyone want a car that's over 20 years old?  If I can't convince you, maybe everyone else in the Diesel club can -- next time you're on the highway, keep your eyes open and you'll begin to see Diesel after Diesel cruising on its way.
