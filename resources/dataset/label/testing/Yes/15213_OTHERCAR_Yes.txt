            My wife and I have owned several vehicles throughout our years together.  Each has had a few things that we didn't like about them and we have never bought the same make and model of car a second time.  The Sienna will be the exception.  It has been a fantastic van.  Ours now has over 30,000 miles on it since we bought it.  It hasn't given us any trouble.  The ride is exceptional.  It rides like the Camry or Avalon.  The Sienna is roomy and very comfortable.  It doesn't have those bumps and bends in the floorboard like so many other vans.  We decided on the Sienna based on a report that the Sienna was the safest vehicle ever tested (Today show Oct.(?) 1999 "Five safest vehicles for 2000").  The acceleration is great.  It has no problem with Houston traffic.  The visability is great and there are no "blind spots" to worry about.  It has no problem manuvering in tight spots and tucks into a one-car garage quite nicely.

The down side to the van is small.  The seats are heavy and it takes some effort to remove them to allow for cargo.  Our dealer found the cheapest tires he could to slap on the van.  I strongly recommend trying for a tire upgrade in the deal (although another Sienna owner told me that getting better tires was the hardest part of the negotiation).  Finally, if you want leather, a moon roof, cd changer, etc.  Stand and deliver.  The Sienna on the showroom floor next to ours at $24,600 MSRP was fully equipped and the top of the line.  It's MSRP was $33,990!  Leather alone was $2000!
