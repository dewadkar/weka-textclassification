            i have owned an infinity qx4 for over a year now. it is a 1998 model, beige exterior with a tan leather interior. this car is extremely nice both in luxury and in performance.  the leather seats are very comfortable, the dash is laid out very well, and the controls are very accessable.  the bose stereo produces excellent sound on all levels.  room is very nice up front and also nice in the rear, except that there is a lack of rear headroom due to the sunroof compartment.  the engine performance is swift and responsive, while the gas mileage is normal of an SUV at about 15mpg.  the 4WD modes are amazing and have gotten me through terrible snow and mud.  i recommend this vehicle to anyone who can both afford and enjoy what infiniti has to offer in a luxury suv.<br><br>
