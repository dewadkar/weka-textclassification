            The Kodak 280 is my first digital camera, and I have had it for about 9 months now. Unfortunately for me, the price has dropped significantly last time I checked but that can be said for all the other digital cameras. Everything I expected from a d.c. was fulfilled from this model. The menu in the preview screen is easy to use, and one can take many different kinds of pictures such as black and white, high resolution pics and sepia. In addition, the camera includes an automatic timer and somewhat of a zoom, but you'll notice that most d.c's don't have much for a zoom as of now. My favourite feature is the USB connection for transferring pics. With Adobe Photodeluxe (provided), pics can be sent to your computer very quickly. After using a d.c., you'll never want to go back to the familiar and annoying routine of developing pictures for every roll of film. Using the preview screen on the back, you can delete photos that don't interest you. However, printing photos will require an above average printer if you want the same quality as a commercial photo finisher. Nevertheless, the advantages which accompany this camera far out weigh the down sides.
