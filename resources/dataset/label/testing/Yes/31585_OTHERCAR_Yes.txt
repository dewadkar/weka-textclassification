            I sell a lot of items on Ebay and I was tired of trying to scan everything with my flatbed scanner to use as pictures for my items. I knew it was time for a digital camera. I visited a few camera shops around town to ask advice and physically hold the cameras.
The minimum camera I wanted to buy would:
1.Be able to take decent lo res pictures for my auctions
2.It must be able to take decent macros. 
3.Be able to take family event and vacation pictures with good enough quality that they are printable from my photo printer.
4.User friendly: I don't want to be fumbling around on that &quot;special&quot; occasion
5.Must have a zoom
5. Sturdy 
6. Under $500.00
I narrowed my decision down between the Epson 750z and the Nikon coolpix 800.
I choose the Nikon because of the higher resolution and the Nikon name.
(I figured Nikon has been building cameras longer than Epson)
I ordered the Camera from www.Buy.com for 400.00 including shipping.
The camera arrived three days later and I was ready to roll.
The camera was almost everything I hoped for.
It fulfilled my whole punch list to the fullest but...not without some things I did not think of:

1.The only interface for downloading was a serial cable (no USB). This method of uploading pictures is very slow!
2.You must use their proprietary software (Nikonview) to upload pictures and that software is not very good. It is very basic.
3. It is not twain compatible. If you have a scanner you should know what twain is. I allows other picture and graphics software the ability to use your device. This feature is important. (I went to their website and cruised the message boards and found a lot of complaints about it not being twain compatible.
4. The lens cover is not attached to the camera (very small and easy to loose) 
5. Takes more battery power than the Bigfoot monster truck.
6.No ac adapter included.

I cured most or the software/ twain issues by buying a Lexar 4x compact flash card with USB reader. Now my computer reads it just like any other hard drive and the picture transfer is very fast. Because it reads it like a hard drive you can use any program you want with it and have no issues.
But some NiMH Batteries! (It takes 4) I bought eight. These batteries are the best you can get and they are rechargeable. They are a perfect addition to this camera. They last through many pictures and outlast alkaline 10 fold. 
 
I can HIGHLY recommend this camera but only if you buy a USB or similar reader and a USB compatible compact flash card. If you buy this as a &quot;set&quot; you will be very happy with this camera.
