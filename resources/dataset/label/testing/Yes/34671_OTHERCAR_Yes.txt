            The Pontiac Firebird is the ultimate muscle car.  Unfortunately, low sales brought it to its demise.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The Firebird just screams muscle car!  The optional SLP Firehawk package adds high-performance tires, 17-inch painted alloy wheels, Ram-Air hood scoop, and an upgraded suspension.  I prefer the look of the SLP Firehawk over the other Firebird models.  To me, it's sportier, and intimidating.  There is a $4,000 premium for all that style, though.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: When you first fire up the engine, the sound alone will immediately remind you of past muscle cars, like the Chevy Chevelle SS 454, Dodge Charger R/T, and Ford Mustang Mach 1.  Most people consider the exhaust rumble "tiresome", but I love that sound!  The instruments are very easy to locate and understand, and very stylish.  The doors are rather long and heavy and make getting out of the car in tight spaces a little difficult.  The hatchback can carry a LOT of cargo room with the rear seats folded down.  Folding the rear seats up makes virtually no sense to me.  Their only real purpose is to keep already high insurance premiums down, as 2-seaters are much more expensive to insure.

<b>ENGINE</b>: Although there is an available V6, my favorite engine option would have to be the 5.7-liter, 345-horsepower, SLP modified, Corvette-derived V-8 engine.    The engine produces a whopping 350 lb./ft. of torque.  Although most buyers prefer the stiff, notchy 6-speed, I actually like the automatic version better.  It's relatively smooth and does not hesitate to downshift.  Most cars with automatic transmissions need substantial rpms to get off the line as quickly as possible.  However, this is not the case with the Firebird.  All I have to do is mash the throttle let the torque do all of the work!  I averaged 14.5 mpg on the recommended premium fuel, but GM says regular can be used as well.  

<b>HANDLING</b>: If you're going too fast while turning on a bumpy road, the rear end WILL step out.  You can thank the dated live rear axle for this characteristic that plagues many other muscle cars.  Otherwise, the wide 275/40ZR-17 tires are very effective at gripping the road.  I love the way the car steers too...very responsive.

<b>RIDE</b>: Obviously this car was NOT designed for comfort.  the ride is very rough.  With a stiff suspension and low-profile tires, it feels as though sometimes I'm crashing over bumps.  If you want a better ride, avoid the SLP package altogether.  You can still get V8 power without the harsh performance/handling package.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: While driving, I did hear a rattling noise coming from the rear axle while driving, but before I returned the car, it went away.

<b>VALUE</b>: In my opinion, the Firebird is a good performance value.  The car is far from a daily driver, but it's still very fun to drive.
