              I liked my 2001 Prerunner Limited Double Cab V-6 when I saw it on the showroom floor just a few short months ago. I was about to buy a Tundra but the rear leg room cramped my legs (I'm 6ft even and mostly legs) when I set the driver seat to a comfortable position for me and then jumped in the back seat.  Ooomph.  Then when I was about to walk out I saw the Double Cab Prerunner on the floor.  I performed the same test on it.  Much better leg room. I didn't really need the V-8 in the Tundra so the V-6 was just fine.  

  This truck seems to lack refinement in a few minor areas.  The gear shifter is a bit out of reach even for me.  It is between the seats over the tranny, but more to the passenger side.  I can barely see the tranny gearshift selector window to see what gear or position the shifter is in.  Secondly, the clock is in a position block almost completely behind the steering wheel.  The gauges lack a voltmeter but I am a gauge freak.  The fuel door is located on the driverside (read: correct side) of the truck but it has no lock. Mine came with the cheezy drop in bedliner.  I have a Line-X sprayed in liner now.  Cheezy SE Toyota alarm remotes need to be better.  The remotes eat batteries like crazy.  A new energizer will work from about 20 feet away.  But just after a few uses you have to be right next to the truck for it to work.  Why did Toyota not make a place for foglights?  Now I have to install a brush guard to mount the foglights on.  I have not yet checked my gas mileage but I get less than @300 miles per tank.  And I'm in flat land Florida. Service department stole $$ out of my truck while getting factory options installed after the sale.  The entire service department seems to have been having a bad day - everyday I deal with them.


The pros are typical Toyota.  Fit and finish to this novice are simply better than any in this class.  I like the seat positioning and was able to see the front of the hood and not just the top of it(GMC).  The rear doors and seats are actually big enough for me and I could ride there for a few hours if needed. The rear windows actually roll all the way down. It does ride like a 4x4 at times but hey, "It's a truck not a sedan". I like the ground clearance.  I used to drive a Honda Accord to this is a real step up for me.  The motor is smooth but it took me some time and a few service visits to get used to the slow starting of this distributor-less engine.  That TRD supercharger looks pretty sweet. My girlfriend likes the factory running boards.  She looks like she is climbing into a big rig.
