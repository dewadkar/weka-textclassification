            I drive a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban.  I would not buy a Suburban for several years because of the price.  However, I needed the room and comfort for work and family.  My car dealer told me that he never sells a different type vehicle to someone once they own a Suburban.  And I think he is right.  Now that I own one, I will never drive anything else. 

The Suburban is comfortable on long trips and has enough carrying space to haul all the suitcases, golf clubs, coolers, etc.  In my work, I need the hauling space for various size boxes and computer print-outs and computer equipment.  The Suburban is the only vehicle that has the kind of space that I need.  

The one thing that I do not like in my Suburban is the cup holder in the front.  It pulls out from the dash and has two holders but one of them is not deep enough to hold cups if you are driving over bumpy roads.  And it rattles.  I would think that Chevrolet could design some kind of cup holder that is located in a better position and deep enough to safely hold cups.       <br><br>
