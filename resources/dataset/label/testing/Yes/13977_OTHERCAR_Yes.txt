            I am the proud owner of a pre-owned Lexus SC300.  I purchased this vehicle from a Lexus dealership &amp; have been happy the whole way.  
I have previously owned 5 cars.  All of which were American. Sadly, I will probably never go back to owning an American made car.  My Lexus has 105k miles on it &amp; it still drives the like the day I bought it with 53k miles on it.  I can't get over how reliable this car is.  Most other cars would have clunked out or taken me to the cleaners on repair costs.
My father even works for Ford Motor Co. &amp; does agree w/me as to the reliability of this car.  I have owned a Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Tracer, Ford F-150 truck, Mercury Cougar &amp; a Chevy Caprice.  None of these cars even come close to the performance of my Lexus.
There are higher costs associated with owning a car like this.  Tune ups are not cheap; usually in the range of $500 or so.  And everything must be be original factory parts; which always costs more.  But, if you take your car to the dealership for regular maintenance, they treat you very well &amp; will even provide a courtesy car for your time if needed. Now that's service!
I also love the respect this car demands from the road and other drivers.  Yes, people do get jealous when they see you in this car.  How could they ignore it beauty.
I even took mine for a nice road trip to South Dakota &amp; it was great fun driving around in those Black Hills &amp; the Badlands.  It was just like a car commercial with all the sharp turns &amp; straight aways.
I would highly recommend this car to anyone.  If you can't afford a new one; well, not many could; definitely get into a pre-owned car.  You will not go wrong &amp; you will have this car for a long time if that is what you are looking for.  Plus, these cars keep their value nicely.  Much better than any American car.  If you are considering this car, go for it.<br><br>
