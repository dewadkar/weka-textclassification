            Have you ever owned a car that no one could identify? Recently, over a week ago, my wife bought a 2000 Kia Sportage. She has been wanting one for months. She loves it. I kinda like it too. I live in a small town. No one knows or has ever heard of Kia. We are the lab mice. We enjoy riding in the Sportage. The suspension carries nicely over rough railroad crossings and the CD player never misses a beat. With two kids, we needed plenty of room in the back seats for growing legs. The Sportage has enough room for adults to sit easy without too much cramping.

We traded in our Ford Aspire, which is made by Kia, in on the Sportage. It was a very good car and well built. Kia has a good reputation with us and that helped in deciding on a Sportage. From the other SUVs, the Sportage has all the same creature comforts as the more pricier models. Even though, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; didn't think very much of the Sportage, we think they missed the overall concept. So far, our Sportage is very well made. Initially, the spare tire rack was hard to lock into place. After a slight adjustment at the dealership, it shuts fine. But hey, I have never bought a car that didn't need 'something' done to it.

We like our Kia Sportage. It is cute, well made and not too costly.<br><br>
