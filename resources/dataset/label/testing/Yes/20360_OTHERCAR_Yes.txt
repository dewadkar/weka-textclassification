            I got this car from dad back in Winter 1998.  I have got to tell you that this has been one of the best cars that I have ever owned. Dodge knew a thing or two when they made the dynasty. They put a powerful 3.3L V6 that takes full advantage of the car. The motor is built for speed and reliabilty. The car has many options compared to some older vehicles including anti-lock brakes and drivers airbag.

So far I haven't had any real problems except for a fuel pump going out and costing $150 to replace with a lifetime warrenty.  Before I recieved I do know that the transmission has been rebuilt before.  But personally I haven't had any transmission problems.  The car itself has over 180,000 on it which is alot for a 92. I plan on driving it until it wears out completely.  This car was made to last a lifetime.
