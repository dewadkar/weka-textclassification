            Let me start off by saying this is simply the best system on the market in any car in terms of useage and abilities.  I sell Hondas and have this system in my Acura Cl type S  You can get the same system in a few of the Acuras.  This system is dvd based so you never have to change discs on a long trip like on some of the cd based systems.  You can pick a destination by address and it will take you right to the location with great accuracy.  The voice on the system is annoying at times but it is easy to understand and gives precise commands.  The map is in color and the screen is easy to see and read.  Another great thing about the system is the touch screen to enter information.  If you are going to a location and traffic hits, just hit detour and it will calculate a new route.  You can make the system give you the most direct route, the route with the fewest turns, make it avoid freeways or toll roads and even avoid specific roads along the trip.  Another great feature is the ability to save previous destinations for later use.  A very useful idea is the places locator, if know the name of a specific place such as a restaurant or building the car can pull up that location as well.  It allows you to look up types of places such as chinese restaurants and lists the distance to travel.  Need gas or money and it will point out the closest atm or gas station for you as well.  The price for this system is 2000 dollars right now but look for it to drop in the future as these systems become more mainstream.    <br><br>
