            I really like the Olympus's C-2500L, I would have bought it if I didn�t have the Kodak 290.  I am �borrowing� the camera for reasons of review (or at least I told that to Bill, my Manager friend at an Electronics store. I couldn�t believe he actually had one of these, so here goes�


Price: $1289.00

Image Quality:  A 2/3 inch, 2.5 megapixel CCD producing a maximum size image of 1712 x 1368 pixels, boosts the C-2500L past other 2-megapixel cameras in terms of image size. But the quality is not THAT much better than the 2 megapixel cameras out there (Notable the Kodak 290)
The TTL viewfinder is where the real strength of the C-2500L comes through. It is fairly bright and shows a sharp image comprising 95% of the frame. TTL viewfinders are hard to beat by any other system, which is why it is the system of choice for the majority of professional cameras. However, they are also more expensive to produce and likely represents one of the major reasons for the cost difference between the C-2500L and other 2-megapixel plus cameras.

Features:  3X Zoom lens and YES, it is a real zoom lens, not the chintzy digital one found on most cameras.  In low light, the Autofocus is assisted by an illuminator, placed just below the lens, which fires extremely bright red beams to help the camera focus accurately. The system is effective, but can be downright nerve wracking for your subject.  Program, Aperture Priority and Manual.  I suggest the program mode where the camera does all the work.   The LCD on the top of the unit gives you the status of a seemingly hundred meters.



Ease of Use:  Out of the box, it was fairly easy to start shooting right away.  I was bothered a bit by the learning curve on the camera features, but I guess I will have to spend the time to learn, seeing that it IS a pro camera.

Although I did not get the additions to try, it has a fantastic flash available for (extra cash of course)   That makes this camera better than most others in the same range.

Ease of transference:  Uses a serial cable connection, or a video out port.

Best Feature:  I like the overall image quality.  I do not have to import the pictures into Photoshop and do immediate color correction like most cameras.  The color reproduction is superb.  When you play with as many digital photos as I do, you appreciate the little things.

Worst Feature:
No USB and it uses Smart Media cards�.  These STINK in my opinion.  I like compact Flash, probably due to the fact that all my other cameras have used it, I have two card readers and I do NOT want to buy any more readers.  Why can�t the manufacturers all use the same media?????

Bottom Line:
If you need a serious camera and are looking for something to replace the norm, Get the Kodak 290, it�s my personal favorite.  This one comes in close second, but it is not worth the extra money.  I am sure the next camera will be, but right now with camera prices dropping each week, you should wait.
