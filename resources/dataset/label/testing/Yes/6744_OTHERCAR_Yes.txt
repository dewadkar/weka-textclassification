            I bought my 1990 Honda Accord last year. The main things that drew me to this particualr used car were price and reputation. What I really wanted was an '85 Monte Carlo, but with the gas prices now, I'm glad my fiancee made me test drive my Honda. 
My car has about 130,000 miles on it, and is now a 10 year old car. I don't notice either one of these things when I look at or drive it. It is in great condition, minus a few cosmetic details inside, and drives wonderfully. I haven't had to put any work into it outside of routine maintenance. 
I didn't think that my car was very noticeable, after all, it is an extremely popular model of car, but I get compliments on it all the time. Thats a real added bonus. Its economical, easy to maintain, and actually looks pretty good. Plus its fun to drive. Of course its only a 4 cylinder, but those ponies like to run. It has some get up and go, and doesn't rattle and shake and strain on the highway, unlike my last car, an Escort. 
The comfort factor is moderate. Not a lot of frills or anything. I love my hidden cup holders though. Good amount of trunk room, especially when the back seat is folded down. 
All in all, I am greatly satisfied with my purchase. I feel that I got a fair deal for a car that I'm told will last me many many more miles. I would definitely consider another Honda for my next car. <br><br>
