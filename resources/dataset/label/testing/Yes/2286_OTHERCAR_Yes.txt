            Shortly after buying my 1999 Kia Sephia I wrote an epinion about it, but my opinion has changed quite a bit over the last year. I can now compare what enticed me into buying the Sephia versus the reality of owning it over the last 14 months.

We bought the Sephia in October, 1999. We needed to replace a 1999 Chevy Metro that was totaled in an accident. The accident would have been rather minor if the Metro wasn't so flimsy. We decided that we really needed a larger car for safety sake; however, we also didn't want to spend more than $10,000. We were rather pleased to find a car that could supply us with more safety while meeting our budget needs. The Kia Sephia is a 4 door car that looks attractive and has a base price well below $10,000. It is a good sized car but by no means a &quot;boat.&quot; It feels solidly built, and has dual air bags.

We bought a pewter colored, automatic transmission LE model with beige interior, floor mats, radio/cassette player, and air conditioning. We had intended to buy a manual transmission, but we got a really good deal on a slightly used model (4,000 miles) so we bought it instead. We paid less than $9,000.

Initially, I was most happy with how the car looks. You can park it next to a $20,000 car and not think that it looks cheap (other than the little red and white KIA emblem.) That holds true today--it is a fine looking car. I was initially happy with the interior as well. They didn't do anything crazy with the colors or add a goofy pattern like some cheap car makers do. The material is obviously not top quality, but it is still holding up well. The piece of plastic that holds the center console down has broken off now, but I haven't had any other trouble with anything like that. The glove compartment is very solid and the lock has held up well, especially considering how much I stuff in there. Overall, after 14 months of ownership, I don't have a problem with the interior. I might choose grey over beige because the floor mats look pretty dirty at this point, but it's no big deal. I definitely recommend using a spray on stain protector, because the seat covers stain easily otherwise.

Initially, I thought the gas tank was extremely small. I couldn't even travel 300 miles without having to fill up again. I received a recall notice where they fixed the gas gauge. This solved the problem momentarily. Eventually we took it in and they did something with the tank and the gauge (I think) that resolved this problem. Thank goodness, because I couldn't have lived with that much longer. I commute over 150 miles every day and was having to fill the tank up every day. Now that it is fixed, I just have fill up every other day.

With today's gas prices, gas mileage is certainly a concern. The Sephia gets close to 30 miles per gallon driving mostly on the highway. My husband gets better gas mileage out of it than I do because he drives more conservatively. I tend to accelerate and decelerate more quickly than he does. I probably get about 27 miles per gallon.

If comfort is an issue with you, I wouldn't recommend buying a Sephia. However, it is much more comfortable than cars of similar price (like the Chevy Metro.) FOR IT'S PRICE, it is pretty roomy and comfortable for short distances. A lumbar support pillow (for low back comfort) should be added to the front seats--at least for the poor driver! 

It is immediately noticeable that the car is slow to accelerate and also has a lot of engine noise upon start up and acceleration. It also often hesitates to start. It's almost like as soon as I get concerned that it will flood and go to turn it off, then it starts. Let me make it clear that it has always started though--even in the extreme cold.

One nice thing about the Sephia is that it has front wheel drive. I have never slid off of the road, and lately that has been a big concern as my area has had so many snow storms. I have spun on the ice though; I would recommend a manual transmission if this is a concern for you.

The only thing my car has been to the shop for is the fueling system like I mentioned and the radio/cassette player. They actually had to replace the radio twice.
Overall, I am satisfied with my Kia Sephia. For the price, I haven't found anything better. I just look forward to when I can afford better.<br><br>
