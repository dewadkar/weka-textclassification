            My mom owns a 94 model Camry that she bought new, and I really like this car.  It has been really reliable, it performs well for the class of cars it is in, and it even looks pretty nice.

The model my mom got is the V6 XLE, with about a 200 hp engine that can actually get the Camry off the line pretty fast.  Actually, this car is probably faster than about 80% of the cars on the road today, and has really good passing power.  My own personal acceleration tests put it at about 8 seconds for 0-60 (highly unscientific, mind you), and it remains stable up to and including at least 120 mph.  

The brakes definitely have significant stopping power, but not quite as much as some of the more expensive German rides (the Audi A6 springs to mind).  The handling is smooth and responsive, with a good on-center feel.  Road vibrations are not felt quite as well by the driver as I would like though...a little more feedback might be nice.

I dislike the fact that no manual transmission was available, but the automatic shifts at the appropriate time (especially in the &quot;power&quot; mode), and does so relatively smoothly.  Also, a car with this much horsepower should be available in RED RED, not the darker red color that we got.

The leather seats are comfortable and have worn really well, partly because we treated them with a lot of leather care products about 2 years ago.  The leather is pretty high quality for the amount this car cost.  Some of the nicer luxury details are lacking, such as wood trim (settle for the molded plastic, it's not that bad), but overall, the cabin appearance is pretty nice.  This car was made before a lot of the whizbang luxury features were introduced, such as dual-zone climate control, but it does have a lot of nice things, such as a really nice 6 way power driver's seat adjustment.

This car has never had any significant problems, and has started every time.  There have been a few unscheduled trips to the mechanic to replace the radio which mysteriously shorted out, and to replace the battery which died (right on schedule for it's expected life), but this car has overall been very dependable.  It starts in any weather, and performs well in the snow (especially with Blizzak snow tires...those things rule).

Overall, for a relatively nice family sedan, the Camry has done very well.  I have no real complaints about it other than little nitpicky things.  Anyone looking to find a good used family sedan should look to a Camry from around this timeframe.<br><br>
