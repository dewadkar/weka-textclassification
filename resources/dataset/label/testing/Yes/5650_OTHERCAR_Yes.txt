            I just traded in my 1999 M Roadster for a 2001 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro. Needless to say my focus has changed, but I wanted to share my experience. This car was in the shop 15 times in 24 months for a variety of problems ranging from a new transmission to a persistent glove compartment rattle. This car will beat you to death, but boy will you have fun dying! I got constant attention (good and bad) in this car. It is faster than almost anything on the road (0-60mph in 5.2 seconds). Problem is that most kids want to test you out. I am not a boy-racer anymore and the constant prodding from 16 year old kids in their modified Integra R's wore me down. The quality problems bugged me and I even wrote a letter to BMW to complain. I got the traditional &quot;sorry but there is nothing we can do&quot;. I was relieved to finally get the car out of my life but I will miss it on sunny days. Everyone should own a car like this at least once. I think it is like that &quot;bad girl&quot; in high school that you know is not good for you but is a LOT of fun to go out with (keep in mind that you don't marry her). If you ever get the opportunity to at least go for a ride in a M Roadster on a nice day, take it (just don't buy it).
