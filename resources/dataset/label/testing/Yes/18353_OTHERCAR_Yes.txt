I leased an Acura Integra LS  sedan in Dec. 98 for $255 per month after trading in a Mazda Protege.

I purchased the Acura for its great shifter, reasonable size and Honda fit and finish, and so far the car has not disappointed. Compared to other models in the price range, it has similar features, but is much better built. I wasn't concerned about the lack of a V6 engine because the four-cylinder gets better gas mileage and has sufficient power.

The car is a pleasure to drive both on the highway and on more challenging roads. The stereo and sunroof are excellent, but I wish the CD player was higher on the dashboard so it could be reached easier.

The car has good space in the cabin for four people and a decent sized trunk, but its small opening make it hard to put anything large in the trunk. The smaller doors also make it hard carry large boxes and the like.

Gas mileage averages around 30, but the small fuel tank means more trips to the gas station. The headlights are particularly powerful and the windows and mirrors give good visibility. 

The short-throw 5-speed shifter is the best part about the car along with the good clutch and smooth revving engine.

I would recommend one of these to drivers seeking a smaller sporty sedan that is low on flash, but high on dash. It is also a good value in the segment of small, pseudo-luxury sedans.
