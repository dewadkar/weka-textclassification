            I purchased my 1995 Dodge Ram 1500 2WD in Aug.1999 from a local Virginia dealer. When purchased the truck had 55,000 original miles. I have since the purchased put an additional 10,000 miles on the vehicle.  Needless to say it does not sit in the drive often.  I enjoy the smooth ride and the power of the 8 cylinder engine.  It is very good on gas between 12 to 15 mpg on the highway.  With the 35 gallon tank you do not have to fuel up often.  I have maintained regular oil, transmission, and fluid changes.  The only other service that has been preformed is that I had new brakes put all the way around.  I find it very comfortable to drive even though I am a small woman.  My only complaint is with the front windshield pillars occassionally the drivers side pillar obstructs my view of the road when making sharp left hand turns.  Thie vehicle gives one a good view of the road.  You sit well avove the other traffic around you.  I can see clearly above most cars and I am not imtimidated by other larger vehicles.  It is a smooth handling truck.  It towes very well.  You can even get into your local Wal-Mart parking lot spaces without problems.  I feel that this is a good vehicle for all drivers.  It is the best truck on the market.  I will purchase another one after I have worn this one completely out.       <br><br>
