            I still get compliments on my 1997 Mazda 626.  I've been driving it for almost 4 years and now have 79,000 miles on it.  I plan on driving it at least until it is paid off.

I bought this car in 1999 as a Certified Used Car with 18000 miles on it and a 4-year, 60000 mile warranty.  I was able to buy the car at Blue Book value.  The dealer was trying to get me to buy a new '99 626 or a Protege, but I hated how cheap the interiors looked.  Then I met my 626 and fell in love.

The styling on the interior of the '97 626 was so nice, that Mazda finally wised up and went back to the same look on the recent models (I drove as rental cars).  It sounds silly, but door handles can really make a nice car look either cheap or classy.  Little details made a difference in my decision: split folding rear seats, rear armrest, pockets on the bucket seat backs, front door storage, a coin holder, cupholders (more on that later), and swinging air vents.  It is extremely roomy, even tolerable with three large people in the back seat.

As far as the engine goes, I should have gotten a V6.  At first, I thought that a 4 cylinder would get better gas mileage, but the car weighs so much that the engine uses more gas anyway.  The car does all right as far as acceleration, but I wouldn't call it "zippy".  However, at high speeds, it's ZOOM-ZOOM.  There's not much it can't keep up with, and it has great handling.

The automatic transmission is a different story.  In rush hour traffic it's the worst.  When it tries to find its place between low gears at slow speeds, it can be rather jarring.  It is also rough when shifting into reverse sometimes.  I tried to address this repeatedly while the car was under warranty, but nothing was ever deemed a problem by the dealerships, and I have never had any work done on it.

I do wish the cupholders were relocated, as they are in the way of the cigarette lighter, a problem that was fixed on recent models.  I also wish that I had gotten the moonroof and a spoiler.  I do hear squeaks from time to time where plastic meets plastic around the gearshift and such.  I don't have any major paint problems, but my trunk lid is dented in a few spots and I don't even know how.  My check engine light comes on for a while and goes off every now and then, but my dealer said that it wasn't storing any codes, so I don't think it's serious.
