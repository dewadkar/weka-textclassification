            I have a 1999 Passat and it's the best car that I've ever driven. Without a doubt my favorite feature (since I am really into music) is the sound system. It rocks. I think the premium sound option with the 
6 Disc CD changer is a must for any person thinking of buying this car. 

The other feature I recommend is the Tiptronic. This feature allows you to switch from automatic to standard driving and vice versa - at any time. It's great to be able to have it in automatic on stop and go freeways and then be able to switch into standard to blow people off the line at stop lights. 

As for the dash lights - well if you haven't heard yet you need to see for your self - it's the first thing anyone who has gotten into my car at night comments on.

Other adjectives - spacious, comfortable, sleek, impressive, reliable, powerful <br><br>
