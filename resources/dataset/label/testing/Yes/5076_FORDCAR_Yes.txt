            My very first car was a 1956 Ford Fairlane with a Fordomatic transmission.  It was a dream car for the oil industry as I put at least one quart of oil in the car each day.  It shook, rattled and rolled appropo to the 50's and the engine finally blew up one dark night on old Highway 80 near Stanton, Texas.  I vowed never to buy a Ford again and agreed with the Fix Or Repair Daily derogatory description.

Fast forward forty years.  I married a very nice lady with a 1997 Ford Taurus.  She was very pleased with the car but I still had my lingering doubts.  After three years of driving it when she's too tired to drive, I have to admit that my doubts were baseless.  This is a very good automobile that Mr. Ford would gladly welcome to his family of cars.

My wife and I are doing kind of a tagteam review here because she drives the car much more than I do.  She is an RN who drives 90 to 120 miles a day to work in area hospitals.  She loves the car.

Let's examine why we both like the vehicle: 

1.  Comfort.  The car seats as many as six people very comfortably.  The seats are very supportive without being overly hard.  There is ample room in the back seat for adult leg room.  The creature comforts within the car are also excellent.  The air conditioning and heating systems are as good as I've ever seen.  

2.  Roadworthiness.  The Taurus holds to the road like pit bull holds its prey.  The turning ratio is excellent although not as good as my Honda Accord.  The car takes corners easily and is very predictable.  High winds which plague West Texas have never been a problem with this car.

3.  High performance.  The Taurus responds well to any situation.  Its acceleration is top notch and works well on the flat West Texas roads passing an 18 wheeler or on a freeway entrance trying not to get flattened by an 18 wheeler.  The brakes have never been a problem on her car.

4.  Economical.  Although I would never have thought that such a responsive car gets good gas mileage, this one does:  28 mpg on the road and 22 mpg in town.  Also the car does not need continuous oil additions like my old clunker.

5.  Stylish.  O.K., maybe the car doesn't look like a Lexas but for a fraction of the cost of that overpriced Toyota, the Taurus is sharp looking.  My wife has tinted windows which help keep the harsh Texas sun from baking her and add a touch of class.

6.  Good sound system.  The car has front and back speakers which can be adjusted left and right or front and back.  They provide excellent sound for radio, cassette, or portable CD.

There has been one negative to this car:  its transmission.  However, my wife had an extended warranty which completely covered the replacement of the transmission around 60,000 miles.  She now has 120,000 miles and has had no more problems.

In short, this is a great car at a reasonable price.  The car cost my wife $13,000 for the Taurus when it had 18,000 miles on it.  To us, the old slogan for Ford is no longer valid.
