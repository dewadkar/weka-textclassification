            I purchased a new Oldsmobile Cutlass in 1999.  By 2002, it only had 40,000 miles on it but was breaking down every other month.  After the transmission had to be replaced in February of 2003, I decided to trade the piece of junk in and get a reliable foreign car.  

I shopped around and the Honda CR-V seemed to fit my needs the best.  Although it is only a 4-cylinder engine, it has 10 more hp than my 6-cylinder Cutlass did.  I get slightly better gas mileage (1-2 MPG.)  It is just a few inches narrower, about 10 inches less in length, and 10 inches taller.  It fits in my garage as easily as my old car.  

Overall, I am very pleased with the CR-V. There are some really cool features like storage cubbies everywhere.  No more excuses for a disorganized vehicle!  There is also a picnic table that doubles as the cargo area floor.  You can find lots of information on the web about this vehicle&#146s specs, so I won&#146t go into all of that here.


There are a few things that I don&#146t like about the CR-V.  They are mostly minor annoyances or things that my old car had that the CR-V does not.

   Center armrests in the front seat are too small.  You  can buy aftermarket replacements so it looks like other people find this to be a problem, too.

   Seats could have a little more padding.  (This is in comparison to my old Cutlass.)

   Not enough foot room for front seat passenger to stretch out, especially if they have long legs and big feet.

   Only one accessory plug in front.

   Intermittent wipers could have more settings

   No daytime running lights.  I got used to this on the American cars and I miss it.

   No power door lock button on passenger side.  

   No audible indicator on Low Fuel.  The light comes on but there is no bell.

   Rear door opens toward the curb.  This is very inconvenient.  Wish I could have a hatchback instead.

   Cargo cover rattles and squeaks when going over bumps. 


Would I buy the CR-V again? Absolutely.  It&#146s a great vehicle and the minor issues I have with it are not enough to rate this vehicle any less than 5 stars!
