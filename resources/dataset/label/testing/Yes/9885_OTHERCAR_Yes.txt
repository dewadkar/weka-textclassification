            I purchased my 1998 Dodge Dakota in Sept. '97. Ever since then I've used it from everything from the short drive to the long, and I mean long, several state highway drive and the bed has had everything from landscaping materials to a college dorm room hauled in it. 

Current Mileage: 50,400

Exterior: The exterior is tough and can handle a lot of punishment. The paint looks the same as it did 3 years ago, esp. after a good wash and a coat of wax. A few nicks and scratches, but I expect those. Bed does not have a liner, but scratches in the bed have not rusted. I've backed into some stationary objects, by accident, and there haven't been any visible damage. 

Interior: The cab for me is a perfect size, I'm 6', I have head room and good leg room. There are a few places to store things, even some room behind the seats, but not much. So don't expect to secure a lot in the cab. If you want to secure a lot, its probably a good thing to get some sort of locking bed cover. The seats take some getting used to but after a while they are ok. Gauges are clear and easy to read, dials and switches are easy to get at and work. Roadway noise is low when driving at high speeds. The stock sound system isn't bad.

Engine: The 3.9L v6 is a great engine for this truck, I would not consider getting a anything less. The engine is powerful enough to handle having the AC cranked all the way up and maintain a highway speed of 70 without any loss of power. The engine compartment is big and spacious, everything is easy to get at. When driving at highway speeds still has enough power in reserve to pass.

Ride: It rides like a truck, but its a comfortable ride.

Handling: Handles like a car. Very responsive.

Reliability: Very reliable. The only maintenance I've had are the regular oil changes, 1 break job, and tires.

Other: With the v6 and a larger fuel tank the truck can be expensive to keep fueled, esp. with todays current gas prices. Breaks are expensive to replace (break rotors, at least a year ago, were hard to find). The set of factory installed tires are in my opinion worthless. They wore out in 24,000 miles. Also expect to pay at least $400 for for good new tires all around. There are only 4 tie down points in the bed, wish there were more.

Overall: If you are looking for a great, dependable, tough, truck and don't need something like a Ram then the Dakota is the way to go.
