            The very first car I ever owned was a little blue 1991 Toyota Tercel. I bought it used for $4500 six years ago, and consider it the best money I have ever spent. This little car is attractive. It's shape never goes out of style, so even though it is ten years old now, it looks like a newer model car. As I said before, we have had this car for six years. We have NEVER had to do any work on it. Unbelievable huh? It's needed new tires occasionally, oil changed, new battery once, and the air conditioner broke at one time, but considering the hot Texas weather it was forced to endure, I can't blame the poor thing. ;-) Aside from those things, nothing has ever been needed. It starts everyday like clockwork. It is small enough to maneuver through traffic perfectly. It has no need for power steering, and even with the 4 cylinder it has more pep and get-up-and-go than our larger 6 cylinder car. I am still amazed at this car. 

We get about 35 miles to the gallon. I have talked to other owners who have gotten up to 45 per gallon. These days that is a life saver. Or fortune saver, rather. Ours is a four speed, is a comfortable drive, easy to handle and never sluggish. The back seat is comfy if compact. There are cubby holes for two people to sit in, making it a relaxing ride. The trunk is huge, considering how small the car is. I have been able to fit things in there that would make you shudder. 

This isn't a luxury car. No cup holders, usually no tinted glass or electric gadjets or sunroof. It's a sensible car for people who just want to get somewhere. It has no trouble going faster speeds, or speeding up fast. I just cannot say enough that our car is ten years old and has never ever needed any type of repair, aside from that air conditioner problem. We are working on 200,000 miles on this car. It runs as smoothly as it did the day we brought it home. Definitely got our money's worth. 

On the down side, the seats are vinyl and tend to rot in the sun. We park in the sun, and it is brutal here in the deep south. Also, the car uses a lot of oil. I don't know where it goes, and as long as I don't see any signs of a leak I am not going to question it. It's always been that way, and putting in a quart every few months is okay by me, as long as she runs as well as she has been. 

Also, the Tercel's resistance to dents, scratches or hail damage is amazing. We have been through some terrible hail storms, some so violent that I thought it would break the windshield. And never has there been a dent found on the car afterwards. Buggies hit the car, cats jump on the car, limbs and braches fall on the car, and never does it leave even the slightest mark on metal or paint. We have had cars parked to either side of it during storms, and seen what they suffered in damage, and the difference is astounding. Hail damage for our SUV. Hail damage on neighbor's cars and trucks, and no scratch nor dent on our little blue car. 

So, I highly recommend this car for the student, or the single men or women who need dependable cars. It is inexpensive, cost efficient, low maintenance and oh so fun to drive. We have moved on to a larger car since starting a family, but we will never sell this car. My husband drives it everyday to work, and we save quite a bit of money on gas. If you need a small, no nonsense car to get you where you're going, get a Tercel. Nothing else will be as good.
