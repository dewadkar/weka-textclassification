            I can honestly say I am not near as worried about my safety as I would be if I drove a smaller vehicle. This car is solid. My nickname for our Crown Vics 1985, and 1987 models, has been Tank, and I think it suits the cars description very well. Yeah it's not as easy to park as a smaller car would be but I have been very pleased with this model for 10 years now and we bought the two we've owned used even!! It's an extremely dependable car with an excellent motor. Regular tune ups and oil changes and that's about all we've ever had to do to our cars. The power locks and windows can be a pain at times but after 150,000 miles these things are to be expected. We first decided on this car because we have a large family and this was really before the minivan got so popular. If you need space and something that will take the abuse of kids and long trips this car does nicely, If you want to look totally cool and stop and go really quick then look elsewhere! It has great power but the shear size of the vehicle doesn't allow for super quick acceleration.
