                 First off, I'm real sorry about what happened to that first guy who's truck burned up, but he must have gotten a bad apple.  This is my second Mits. truck.  First was a 87 that left my hands at about 230k miles and is still on the road.  It's a little rough looking around the edges, though.  Anyway, I can't speak for 4wd/v6-auto units, but the 2wd 2.4L 4cyl-stick shift reg cab short bed has been very good to me.  Bought it in mid 98 from some kid with 140k miles.  Drove from TX to MD (almost 2k miles) a week later with no problems except for a tire puncture, which doesn't count.  So far, the only forced repair that I've done was a blown heater hose.  It was the original and was 10 yrs old.  Happened while driving in town, so at a light I saw the steam cloud and shut it down b4 the engine overheated.  
     I Learned a lot from the first truck as far as precautionary maintenance. 1:  Replace lower control arm bushings with polyurethane ones.  It will hold front end alignments much better that way.($30 parts, bout $100 or so labor...I did it myself)  2:  Replace the timing belt and balance shaft belt every 50k.($60 parts, $100 or so labor...did myself in 45 min)  3:  Replace the thermostat every couple of years.  I had one stick closed on the first truck and almost cooked the engine.($7 parts $25 labor...did myself in 15 min, but made small coolant mess)  4:  Seat belt buckles may act up.  There's a recall (#: SR-95-002 Date: 951001) so you can get them fixed for free.  By the way, in 10 years, that is the *one and only* recall.  Not too shabby in my book.
     I've also had a thorough cleaning of the radiator (rodded out is what to ask for) done, put in a new clutch kit (friction disk, pressure plate, throwout bearing, and pilot bearing), and replaced U-jount bearings, brakes, ball joints and tie rod ends, and plugs-wires-cap-rotor.  None of this stuff was pressingly needed, but helps keep it running and driving as good as it possibly can.
     I bought this truck because it looked good cosmetically and because the last one was so good.  It turned out not to be a mistake.  The truck has 181k miles now and the only mechanical problems are a rough idle, some oil-smoke on start-up(likely valve stem seals), and a little valve train noise(likely loosening tolerances in hydraulic valve-lash adjusters).
     Watch out, though.  As my father has discovered the hard way with his Mits. truck, these engines DON'T tolerate amateur-hour rebuilds.  Some yahoo did his and he's had nothing but trouble from it since.  I would walk away from any truck for sale with a rebuilt engine in it.  I can't justify the risk.  With proper care and feeding, there is simply no excuse for anything less than 200k miles of service from the factory engine.
     Gripes:  Wind noise, rattling trim at high speed, non-stellar acceleration, squeaky rear suspension, squeaky steering column, wears outside edge of front tires(more negative camber may help but would likely increase steering effort), bouncy ride(tons smoother in long wheelbase versions), lousy sound deadening(bad for peace and quiet, but good for hearing problems before they reach critical mass).
     Loves:  Engine durability, stiff rear end handles heavy loads well (but rides badly when empty), good overall build quality takes abuse in stride. 
     Summary:  While it's no cream puff, it's a darn good piece of basic utilitarian transportation that will give many years of useful service.  The only thing that I know of that can compare is the Nissan Hardbody pickup.<br><br>
