            I bought this car from my best friend (the original owner) for the measly sum of 200.00.  It had 220,000 miles on it, and was in dire need of a head gasket.  I am a courier who tends to put approximately 215 miles per day on a car, so I needed something that was not only dependable, but got great gas mileage as well.  And my 91 Metro has turned out to be all that and more!!!!

The seats are really comfy, and although acceleration tends to be sluggish, I don't think you could find a more dependable car if you tried. (I've owned 2 Chevy cavaliers with over 200,000 miles each which were great cars) I am proud to say that my Metro has 334,000 miles on it and still sounds great, gets around 53 MPG, and runs as good as the first day it drove off the showroom floor!

This isn't a 'babe' car, but if you are looking for really great transportaion at a reasonable price, not to mention the fact that 10.00 will get you a long way as far as gas, then the Geo Metro is definitely the car for you!!!

My only complaint other than the fact that it does tend to eat up timing belts, is that the heater is really subpar.  It seems that you can never get the interior warm enough.  But hey, that's why god gave us jackets!!!
