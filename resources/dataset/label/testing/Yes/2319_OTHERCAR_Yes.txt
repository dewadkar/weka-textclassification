            After our beloved pickup truck took it's last drive, we needed a new car. We wanted to check out the Kia Sportage, but ended up purchasing a Kia Sephia instead. While looking at Sportages, we spied the sleek, affordable little Sephia. Took a test drive, and my husband and I fell in love with it. It was exactly what we were looking for in a car. The model we got is the 1999 LS. It has comfy upholstered seats. Air conditioning that is sure to make even the hottest California commute pleasant. The automatic model is zippy and great on gasoline. Stereo system is excellent, no problems with CD player what-so-ever. 

We kind of took a leap of faith based on the test drive, as we hadn't really done any research on the Sephia. It has been like a dream come true. The car runs nicely and is something you can drive around in feeling good about. The ride is smooth, especially on freeway. The model we got is black with spoiler and looks a little like a more expensive car, such as a BMW. Attractive tail lights and overall lines.

This car would be great for a small family. It is affordable and roomy.
The only problems we've had have been 2 parts on factory recall (which Kia dealerships replace for free). Windshield wiper bolt and a fuel pump line that leaks fumes that they want to recall because it hurts the environment. 

We are absolutely thrilled with our '99 Sephia LS. Take a test drive and see for yourself.<br><br>
