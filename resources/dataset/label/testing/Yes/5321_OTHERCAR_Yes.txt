            Of the Japanese cars, this would rank average.  While one would ask what a red-blooded American is doing in a Jap car, one must consider the ridiculousness of the Taurus in recent years.  While the Taurus 2000 will shatter its competion, the Ford has laggered behind in previous years, leaving the Camry and Accord.  The Camry, riding on its referrals definately costs too much.  The Accord is the onyl one left.

That doesn't sound too good but that's what it is.  However, it's dependable and quick with the turn.  What it lacks is a keen exterior that will attract buyers.  Obviously, it attracted me.  Well, not really, I was going for the sticker price.  It has smooth handling and its not bad when it lasts you over 150,000 miles
