            I just bought myself a spankin' new Millenia Premium with 48 miles on the odometer...for $19,995.

The price reflects the fact that Mazda is trying to get rid of the existing inventory to make way for a new model.  Regardless, with a MSRP of $29,058 for my car, it meant that I could trade in another car with a serious balloon payment and still come in over $2000 under MSRP on the financed amount.  If your local Mazda dealer has several on the lot, right now is a good time to make a deal.

Now, if I were reviewing this car at it's MSRP, I would not be quite so enthusiastic.  But for the going rate of $23,000 including Mazda's $6000 rebate, it's one heck of a value.

The best thing about the car is its comfort.  The seats are simply awesome.  The leather is soft and supple without the perforations you find in a Camry.  The ride is firm enough to keep the car stable and soft enough to keep the car quiet on all but the worst roads.  The car is very comfortable for tall people, a classification I qualify for at 6'1" and for wide people, which I also qualify for at 300 pounds.

Mazdas are also known for being well built.  This is my second Mazda, the first being a 1989 626 Touring Edition which I would still be driving if not for an unfortunate flood.  The Millenia feels as solid as the proverbial bank vault.  I've driven BMW and Mercedes vehicles and am impressed with the solidity of the Millenia's space frame in comparison.  The fit and finish of the interior are superb for the $23,000 going rate, and not bad at the $29,000 MSRP.  Accord and Camry don't offer leather that comes close to the Millenia's.

The only real shortcoming of the car is its base 2.5L V6.  It only has 170hp and it shows.  The automatic doesn't help matters because it tends to short-shift the upshifts unless you are being really aggressive.  If you engage the Hold mode of the transmission things get a little better, but you loose 4th gear in the process.  When a car is underpowered it tends to live more at higher RPMs and thusly fuel mileage suffers.  I have not put enough miles on the car yet to have a representative consumption rate, but so far it hasn't been close to the EPA estimates.

The one creature-comfort that is sorely lacking from the P model is the 6-disc in-dash CD-changer.  An optional trunk mounted unit is available, but in-dash units are standard in just about everything in the $30,000 neighborhood these days.  In the $23,000 neighborhood, 6-disc in-dash changers are almost always a reasonably priced option.

When comparing the Millenia to cars in the same price range at the street-price level, the competition isn't quite so stiff.  Only the Camry and Accord really offer quality approaching the Millenia, but you get much more luxury for the money with the Millenia.  Even the decked out Camry (at $27,000) falls short of the Millenia's leather and finish.

The real question here is do you care that a new Millenia is around the corner and that this model is about to become last week's news?  I didn't.  The value of getting a car with a 3 year, 50,000 mile warranty, road-side assistance, and very good fit and finish with plenty of space for the family was more than the $19,995 sale price.  My dealer is even paying for all of the scheduled service for two years.

Overall, if you can pick up a Millenia with the $6000 rebate, you're going to get a fine automobile for the money.  If you're dealer kicks in some discount of it's own, you're going to get one of the better values on the road.
