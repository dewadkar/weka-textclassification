            I'm writing about my 1992 Accord LX, 4dr.  I originally went to buy a Honda because I knew they kept their value.  I didn't have a particular model in mind, but was attracted to the Accord because of the way it felt on the test drive. I was 22 yrs. old and still wanted a fast car, but I also figured it was time for more of a &quot;family&quot; sedan. It was so comfortable, yet it would also fly when I laid on the gas.  The suspension was great, taking bumps in the road very smoothly - without shaking the entire car! It was a great car for long trips, and four medium to large build adults could fit easily and still have room for a six foot sub!!!  Really, it was nice to be able to pick up a few people for an outing and not have to apologize for &quot;no leg room&quot;.  Plus, you would have to look at the speedometer to see if you were speeding because 80 mph only felt like about 50! Which would explain why I had to go to defensive driving school because of the speeding tickets I got in my Accord.  

Mechanically, the car was also a dream.  I only changed the oil every 3,000 miles and never had to have any major work done.  The distributor had to be replaced due to a recall on that particular year, and the CV boots were replaced, which I have since learned is a problem with a lot of Hondas.  Other than those minor repairs, it ran beautifully until I
fell asleep and drove it into the side of a 18 wheeler at about 70 miles per hour on the highway!!  That car is part of the reason I'm here today -besides the fact the airbag discharged, I feel the strong build of the car made a difference as well.  The windshield was shattered and the front end was crushed into the front seat, but I'm still here to write an opinion about it!! Had I not demolished the car in this fashion (the mileage was at 130,000), I'm sure I would've been driving it for the next 8 years.<br><br>
