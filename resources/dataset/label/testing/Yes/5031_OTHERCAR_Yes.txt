Call it a poor mans STS but make no mistake about it, you won't feel poor when driving this car! The loaded GS has it all,leather interior, astro-roof, dual-climate control, steering wheel radio controls, on-board computer that monitors things such as PSI boost, fuel remaining, low tire monitor &amp; oil life. The Monsoon sound system is crisp and clear and since there is hardly any road noise you don't have to blow your speakers when on the freeway. The guts of the vehicle derive from the 3800 V6 SUPERCHARGED engine. GM claims 0-60 in 6.5 seconds and I wouldn't doubt a second of that! It is a sleeper and the 1999 Mustang GT I had fun with can attest to this! In closing this car is nice, really nice. Comfortable, stylish, fast, roomy, quiet. I would consider this as a viable alternative to the higher priced Euros and Cadillacs... <p>
