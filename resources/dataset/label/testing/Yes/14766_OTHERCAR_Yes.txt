            American society has now embraced the relatively new trend in SUVs. Presently more and more car company's make SUVs. With this increase in SUV production, comes in increase in car buyer's conflict over which SUV to choose. Since a good number of the people that purchase SUVs are not extraordinarily rich, a question over price to quality is often stressed for the car buyer. The best solution to this conflict comes in a Mercury Mountaineer.

What Is The Interior Like?
Well the interior of any car can vary depending on the car owner. He may decide to change the interior, or maybe he is a slob. I do not meet those standards so my description can be used as a good representation of the Mountaineer. The Interior is very comfortable. My particular car comes equipped with a cd player, a am/fm cassette, power everything, and the seats will put passengers to sleep.

How Does The Mountaineer Handle?
Well in my experiences I have listened to many people complain about their particular SUV and how it's handling is not very extraordinary. The first time I went for a joy ride in my Mountaineer I noticed how wonderful the handling is. I almost forgot that I was in an SUV. It handled almost as well as a high performance sports car. The seats can be adjusted with a power switch that allows the big and tall extra room behind the steering wheel.

Where Would I Be Able To Purchase A Mountaineer?
Purchasing a Mountaineer should not be a major problem. I would suggest looking in your local phone book to find a local Mercury car dealership. If you have trouble another good place to find help would be the Mercury website. Mercury Mountaineers are not terribly expensive, and perform better then their price.

Did You Have Any Trouble With The Mountaineer?
I must admit that it was very hard to find anything wrong with the Mercury Mountaineer. After a lot of thinking I can only come up with one minor problem. Driving any SUV around can be difficult to get used to. Especially when you've been driving regular size cars around your whole life. Driving a SUV is fun however, and will not take too much time to get used to.

What Other Types Of SUVS are there?
Well other SUV models include: Ford Explorer, Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and many others. If I had to pick one SUV out from this crowd that was the best deal and the best SUV, I would have to say that the Mercury Mountaineer meets these standards. Mercury stands out above these cars like the Explorer due to the more comfortable interior and superior handling. The Explorer in my opinion is a decent SUV. However to those people that are looking to buy a brand new SUV I would strongly recommend the Mercury Mountaineer.
