            I initially purchased this vehicle to transport myself and my possessions to and from school in Virginia.  As I live in New Jersey, the trip is quite long and I only make one trip.  Thus, the car had to large enough to hold my 6'5&quot; frame and all of my stuff comfortably for seven hours.  In addition, I am a car fanatic and needed something sporty.  Also, I am rather picky and required that the car was a manual shift and had a sunroof.  The Integra provides all of these features at a reasonable price, and in addition has a reputation for bullet-proof reliability (well maintained Integras will easily pass 180,000 miles).

Loves and Hates:
LOVES: The shifter and clutch are buttery smooth.  My stick-shift experience was very limited, and I was shifting smoothly within a few weeks.  The clutch is also very strong (it had 35,000 miles on it before I &quot;learned&quot; with it, and it still has lots of life left in it).  Its handling is superb.  The acceleration is certainly adequate for ANY merging or passing situation.  The versatility provided by the hatchback style is great.  No other body style matches the sporty look with cargo hauling ability so well.  The interior is also upscale looking and feeling.  Gas mileage is very good; I average 33-36 mpg on long highway trips averaging about 75mph with a fully loaded car and the AC on.

HATES: Engine rpm at highway speeds are a bit too high for my taste (2850 rpm at 60mph), and the engine gets &quot;boomy&quot; above 3500 rpm.  This means that long trips above 80mph should be accompanied by loud music (Note: The base stereo is rather weak, but installation of an aftermarket stereo will take the inexperienced less than 2 hours).  Headroom for my 6'5&quot; frame is a little tight after 7 hours.  Exterior styling is a bit dull.

Driving this vehicle is a blast.  It takes corners with the verve of an M3 (well, almost).  Low-end torque is certainly adequate, though I advise against starting in 2nd gear.  Also, adding a few passengers and running the AC seriously diminishes performance.  Around town you find yourself shifting quite a bit though it is certainly not a chore with the buttery shifter.

This car is perfect for any child-less (back-seat is cramped) person looking for a solid, reliable, fun to drive, practical, sporty... car.

Numerical Review:
Engine: 9 (smooth and powerful)
Transmission: 10 (like butta)
Styling:  exterior: 6.5
          interior: 9.5
Handling: 9.5
Reliability: 10
Cargo hauling: 8
Safety: 8 (no airbags)
Comfort: 7 (Much higher if you're shorter than 6'5&quot;)
