            Why buy --  I have not purchased, I have rented several base models of 1999 and newer, during my travels.  This automobile is classy and sporty in appearance and performance, with a price under 25,000 USD.

Enjoy --  Room for large people front and rear, deep trunk.  Smooth body lines interior and exterior.  Long windshield and low nose permit good visibility.  Soft-off interior lighting, super air conditioning, a disc brake per wheel, power and cruize controls, and much more.

Dislike --  High rear deck obscures view of nearby road surface and short objects, much like the visibility from within a sport utility or mini-van, but a needed sacrifice for cargo volume.  This automobile cockpit is for people taller than 62 inches (~158cm).  Its driver seat swallows my 65&quot; sister.

Driving --  Good torque.  Engine seems to gasp for air at and above midrange RPM.  Steering is smooth with pivot radius, and turns are firm.  Base model needs more muscle for hills, but it seems more agile than most mid- and full-size sedans.<br><br>
