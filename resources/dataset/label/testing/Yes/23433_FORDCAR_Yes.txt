            The 2000 LX we have just purchased is the third version of the Taurus we have owned.  We had one in the early 90's, then a 1997, and finally this one.  Each has been a very different car, both in design and handling.

I actually liked the radical styling of the '97, oval though it was. In fact, when it was time to replace our Explorer, I even considered buying a '99 Taurus just to get the last model year of that design.  However, we went with the 2000 instead, and that wound up being a good decision.

The 2000 LX is the base model of the line.  However, the car is so well equipped, that it can hardly be considered a &quot;stripped down&quot; version of the real thing as some entry models are.  It comes equipped with a Vulcan flexible fuel V6 (it can run on ethanol if it is available in your area). There are also touches like a built in security system, inside trunk emergency release (in case someone gets locked in), re-designed air bags and power windows that make this a wise choice.

The engine is powerful enough to make the merge into highway traffic easy. I drive a combination of highway and local streets to get to work and it has averaged 21 miles per gallon.

It fits 5 comfortably.  We also own a 2000 Saturn LS (read my full review of that if you like for comparison).  Both the Saturn and the Taurus are classified as &quot;mid-sized&quot;, though the Taurus rides like something a bit larger. It is quiet and stable.

The only annoying thing we have encountered has been the Check Engine Soon light.  It popped on 4 hours after picking up the car.  We had everything checked out and a fuel sensor was replaced.  A couple of weeks later, the same thing happened.  In reading the instruction manual, it appears that this car is particularly sensitive to the amount of pressure in the gas tank. Make sure the cap is on tight, or the light may pop on unexpectedly.  It will go out after several successful starts once the condition is fixed.

The security system is key driven.  Without a properly programmed key, the engine will not start. This is a nice feature.  Be warned though, spare keys cost over $20.   If you lose one of your original keys, and don't have a spare, the car must be brought in for the replacement keys to be re-programmed.<br><br>
