            We purchased the MPV (2001 ES) last year and could not be happier. First things First; We previously owned a Jeep.  Great car, except that it was 8 cylinders and cost a pretty penny in gas. My wife enjoyed being able to see above the road as opposed to driving a car but was not ready to say "I drive a minivan."  Living in NY does not make it any easier, parking is tough enough as it is and most other vans were larger (and not as stylish). So, we went for the Mazda. (Believe it or not, one friend thought it was the Acura MDX from both inside and out!).

Pros; Has Style, affordable on gas, fits many comfortably car pool is a breeze), rear heat / AC controls, rear windows go down, plenty of cup holders, captain chairs, seats are easily collapsible / removable, ample trunk space, great sound system, short length, drives like a car. 

Cons; acceleration, handling in snow is poor (unless I just got too used to 4WD), Driver comfort is fair on long drives (not necessarily poor), slightly poor design in reference to radio controls (1 & 2 are hard to get to or see from certain angles of the tilt wheel).

Considering the cons, that really not so bad. We love it! Roof rack is a should have. It allows for you to get any of the attachments or for extra luggage for a long trip, as well is the cargo net & rear AC controls.  We went on a ski week with 3 kids and needed a soft roof bag in order to fit all our (bulky) stuff. For convenience if you can afford it get the multi CD changer, I didn't but I think it's worth it now.  We paid about $23,500 ? from Cars Direct.com.  Very happy with the price, but the dealer could have been closer.
