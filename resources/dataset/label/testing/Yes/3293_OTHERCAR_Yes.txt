            I've had my 1998 Millenia for about 5 months now and I must say that overall, I'm very satisfied.  This car provides a level of comfort and luxury that you simply cannot get from the average Camry or Accord on the street.  In fact, at $16,000 I paid just about the same as a used Camry or Accord would have cost.

The car is very comfortable, with heated leather seats, and an automatic climate control system.  Just set the temperature that you want and the system will maintain it automatically.  The factory sound system is fantastic.  It's a Bose, 5-speaker, AM, FM, Cassette, CD player.  Plenty of power for whatever kind of music you like.

In terms of driveability, the car handles like a dream.  Very stable steering; the car simply goes exactly where you point it.  

I only have 3 complaints about this car.  First, I have the standard 2.5L V-6 engine.  While being adequate enough for typical city/highway driving, the engine doesn't produce quite enough power for my taste.  This is the same engine used in the 626.  However, the Millenia is several hundred pounds heavier, it it shows in the car's pick up.  Secondly, the fuel economy is less than spectacular.  Requiring premium fuel, I am averaging about 18-19 mpg in city driving.  Again this is probably due to the weight of the vehicle.  Finally, the level of engine/road noise that enters the cabin is just a bit more than one would expect from a near-luxury car.  However, I must confess that part of the engine noise is due to the K&N air filter that I have installed.  That filter allows a larger volume of air to reach the engine (supposedly to increase horsepower) and as a side effect, makes the engine sound louder.

Overall, I am quite pleased with the car.  I think if you are looking to spend 16-18k for a used car, you should definitely take a look at the Millenia.  

And, you won't be just another Camry or Accord going down the road!
