            My first car was a green 1992 GS model Eclipse with a standard transmission and 68,000 miles on the odometer for which I paid $6200.  At the time I obtained it the car was four years old, and I had it for a little over two years.  During those two years I never had a single mechanical problem, and got respectable gas mileage.  Since it was a standard it was a blast to drive, but with the 4 cylinder not to powerful to overwhelm my inexperienced driving skills.  The hatchback was very useful for toting large items.  Many of my friends with Civic and Corollas could not fit as much in their trunk as I could, and on top of all this it is just a good looking little car!  The negatives to my Eclipse were that Mitsubishi dealers can be few and far between, and that the paint quality was less than stellar.  The covering on the wheel rims of my Eclipse had already begun peeling away at 4 years and were not covered under warrant, nor were any of the numerous places where highway gravel chipped the paint off.  My mom had a 1991 Mazda without any of these paint defects. I live in a very hot part of Texas, with heat indexes regularly topping 100 degrees.  After I sold the car for $5500 in favor of something bigger to take to college, I heard that the man who bought it had been forced to pay a thousand dollars to have the computer timing chips replaced because they had all melted in the heat.  I doubt if this is a common problem, but I do think that it illustrates how Eclipses are not cheap to repair.  At least for me though, I had 2 wonderful trouble free years in a stylish ride that I was very sorry to see go.  No car is without problems and the Eclipse has its fair share like any other, but if you are looking for a mechanically sound and economically reasonable ride with style, then you should seriously consider the Eclipse.  <br><br>
