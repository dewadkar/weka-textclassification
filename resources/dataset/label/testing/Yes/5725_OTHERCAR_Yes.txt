            I once rented a 1992 Plymouth Acclaim for two weeks for a business trip.
My rental car had a champagne finish and dark brown cloth interior. It also had the 2.5 liter 100 hp in-line four mated to a 3 speed automatic.

My personal car at the time was a 1989 Cadillac Brougham and I found the Acclaim, an economy car, very comfortable for the 300 mile trip. I was surprised at how roomy this much smaller car was and how much luggage could fit in the trunk. The interior was nice and the instruments were easy to read. It was beauty in its simplicity.

The Acclaim was hardly a hot rod, but the four cylinder engine provided adequate passing power on the PA Turnpike. The radio reception was crisp and clear and the air was so efficient that my hand closest to the vent felt like it was getting frostbite. This was great considering I was wearing a suit and it was the hottest summer in the past five years.

One could say that the name &quot;Acclaim&quot; was Plymouth's way of cashing in on Honda's &quot;Accord.&quot; If one looks at the Acclaim, it's easy to see that its styling is an evolution of the old Reliant K-Car, yet it comes off much better. It doesn't look as dumpy as its ancestor despite still rather boxy styling. The grille on the 1993 and later models is prettier than the 1992. If one has the gold package, the car looks really shape. Dark green metallic with the gold package and cast aluminum wheels is the sharpest-looking configuration of an Acclaim I've ever seen. It almost looks like a luxury car.

My rental wasn't the only experience I had with the Acclaim. I used to carpool with a woman who owned a 1993 Acclaim and three of of sat very comfortably in the back seat. The Acclaim may be boxy, but its squared off roof provided adequate head room for a 6' rear passenger. 

If there's anything bad I can say about the Acclaim, it isn't much. Some of the plastic interior panels looked cheap and the doors were rather thin, but one can't expect Cadillac or Lexus quality at this end of the spectrum. My experience with the Acclaim was one of the factors in deciding to check out a Plymouth Breeze with my girlfriend to replace her aging Mercury Tracer. I consider the Breeze as the Acclaim's sleek-looking descendant. The Breeze even had an Acclaim-like grille. But, alas, Daimler-Chrysler stopped making the Plymouth.  

It's a shame Daimler-Chrysler cast Plymouth adrift. Plymouth used to be the third best-selling make in the USA. GM has put a lot of effort toward reviving Oldsmobile and its results were the awesome Aurora, Intrigue and Alero. Daimler-Chrysler should've put the same effort toward Plymouth and brought back a revived Fury. The Prowler was a nice experiment, but you need more mainstream models to revive a make. Like it was from 1928 through mid 1950s, Plymouth could've become the no-nonsense value leader of the D-C pack - a lot of car for very little money. It seems Plymouth's old role is now being filled with the likes of the vastly-improved Hyundai Sonata.<br><br>
