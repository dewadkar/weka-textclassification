            I did preliminary research on some of the "cheaper" SUVs because I wanted one.  My husband and I checked out the Xterra, Isuzu Rodeo, Toyota RAV4, and Honda CRV.  The Xterra seemed like the best vehicle for the price.  

My husband got it because I wanted it.  But after a few months of driving it, he admitted that he likes the car much better than he thought he would.

The Xterra is basically an enclosed truck.  It rides and drives like a truck.  It's not a designer SUV.  You can take this one places.  It's good for driving over curbs.  :)  

We haven't had a problem with our Xterra yet.  It is almost 3 years old and runs great.  We haven't had to take it in for any repairs, just basic maintenance.

As for the features of the Xterra, there are 12V outlets in the dash and in the cargo area, which are convenient.  The cargo area is spacious, and has a pull-over cover to hide the contents of the cargo area.  The first-aid kit attached to the trunk door is neat, although we've never used it yet.  (I guess that would be a good thing.)  My only complaints are that the back seat is not too spacious, and the glove compartment is way too small.  And the speed is limited at about 95 mph.  But I guess you don't need to be going that fast in an SUV anyway.

The car handles great, but could use more horsepower.  Although it doesn't have as much horsepower as the "bigger" SUVs, like the Pathfinder and Cherokee, it still goes when you want it to.  I know the later models have more horsepower, so Nissan is paying attention.
