            I recently bought an Olympus 360 based on numerous opinions of people and the price/feature ratio. What I found out was more then I bargained for.

Many reviews that I had read stated that the pictures quality was good (not the best), the battery life was OK (not the highest) and the serial connection for loading pictures was mediocre (not zipping along on USB). What I found after buying this camera was the following:

The picture quality was WAY better then expected!!! Even shooting in the standard mid quality mode the pictures turned out beautifully! 

The battery life was AMAZING! Many of the web sites I had visited stated that you could expect to be changing batteries often. We took the camera to the zoo and shot over 200 pictures on one set of batteries. The trick: Use your viewfinder INSTEAD of the LCD display. Even using the LCD to focus in on your subject for many shot we still ended up not even needing to swap batteries during the entire 6 hours.. and the camera was on for most of that!

The loading time for the images from camera is not all THAT bad. While it is a little slow in serial mode ( I haven't tested it on USB yet) it is really nothing to fret about.

The software that Olympus provides does the job very well of being able to catalog your images and viewing them and also allows some functions to be carried out over the camera such as erasing the media cards and such.

There is a slight learning curve in learning all the features despite it being a point and shoot camera. You do have some control over lighting expose and wether the flash goes off as well as zoom/not to zoom... the standard stuff. It's worth the cram session with the manual just for some of the pictures you can take with it alone!

Overall I was very impressed by the camera and I have to give it a many thumbs up due to the fact that the quality far outweighs what I had read in many other reviews and it is WELL worth the price!<br><br>
