            The new AGFA Photo 780C is an easy-to-use, fairly low cost way to enter the world of digital photography.  At a street price of $175-$200, it takes photos which are of fairly high quality.  It gives you the ability to select 4 flash modes (always on, always off, auto, and red-eye auto) and 4 levels of resolution.  With the included 2MB SmartMedia card, you can take between 12 and 96 photos, depending upon the selected resolution (you can mix resolutions on one card).  It comes with a cable to transfer photos to a PC through the serial port, and also has a cable for displaying photos from the camera directly through the PC.  When shooting pictures, you can either use the viewfinder or the LCD display on the back of the camera (but you have to hold the camera very steady to use the LCD viewfinder).

I do most of my shooting with a Nikon SLR, and did not intend for the Agfa to take its place.  I purchased it to be able to quickly send images to friends and relatives without having to get film developed and prints scanned, and it certainly fills that purpose well.  It's simple to learn, simple to use, and people have consistently been impressed with the quality of the photos it takes.

The only complaints I have about the camera are that it seems to drain batteries fairly quickly (I'm using rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries - 4 AA), the battery indicator does not seem to be particularly accurate at times, and the flash indicator in the viewfinder is so bright that it can be very distracting.  Even so, I would still recommend the camera to anyone looking for a simple, relatively inexpensive way to get started in digital photography.<br><br>
