            After 170,000 + miles on a 1990 Pontiac Grand Am, we decided it was time to get another car.  Let me add that the '90 Pontiac was taken all around the country not only for vacations, but also when moving place to place (Texas, North Carolina, Maine).  Plus - it was driven from one place to another, not only carted.  We never had any kind of major problems ever with the '90.  Of course we took care of the automobile and had regular oil changes and check ups, but after a lot of highway driving from one coast to the other, the miles were adding up, and before we knew it we saw an obdomitor reading of 160,000 +.  The hunt for another car began.  We knew we wanted another Pontiac simply because of the reliability, and durability, and that is what we purchased.  By the time we drove our new '99 home, the '90 read 170,000 +.  Even with 170,000 + miles, the car is probably suiting a young teen learning how to drive just well.  Our new Pontiac is great - it rides better than a &quot;caddy&quot; and was very affordable compared to other cars on the market.  When making such an investment, it feels good to pay less, and to get a car that will last and last.<br><br>
