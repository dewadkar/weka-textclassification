            I love mercedes !

I have just bought my new 2001 c240 and I am impressed with styling, handling and everything. It is a very cool car. V6 makes it hasty. Body styling makes it sexy, bright lights makes other cars envious, and The Person on the wheel gets a glimpse of heaven. Its a true heavenly experience driving a car that has power and has looks that puts shame to BMW or lexus.

Best interior design award goes to mercedes C class. I seriously looked at BMW 328i and Lexus IS300, IS300 interior was the ugliest I have seen in lexus. BMW was very tight interior as well.

Cool Features take it to TOP : This car is packed with cool features like sun screen for rear passengers, remote trunk, press a button and flip down head rests, GPS system, Electronic Slip Protection, big wheels, cup holders are the coolest I have seen. 

This is also one of the safest car on road with 8 airbags and all other Mercedes safety features.

I think anyone looking at BMW or lexus should definitely test drive this puppy and things will change. I BET on that.<br><br>
