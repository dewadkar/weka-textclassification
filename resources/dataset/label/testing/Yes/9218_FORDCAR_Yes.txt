                My second Sport Trac (traded in a '01) is a yellow XLT Premium with leather, 6 CD changer, sunroof and bed extender. Call me nuts but I traded early simply because I liked the color! (no yellow in '01). The changes for '03 are: 2-tone leather, 4 wheel disc brakes, improved door handles and some minor bits. I bought another one also because this is the most practical vehicle I have owned. It will carry 4 adults in comfort with rear a/c and stereo controls and a load of topsoil in the back. The ride is comfortable, less trucklike than the F-150 and acceleration is brisk with V-6 gas mileage. With the bed extender, longer items fit in back, but the truck can fit in a standard parking space. Other neat features include the rear power vent window, 12V bed plug, storage bins behind the rear seats, overhead console w/temp and direction and dual 12v dash plugs. The 2-tone leather looks sharp but it's Ford "pleather"- my Lexus GX470 has real soft leather- at a price.. Controls are logically placed,  Pioneer stereo is good and truck handles better than I expected. I got a U-haul hitch and pulled a loaded 6x12 trailer- the ST was working hard but managed well. Wind noise is much less at speed than my '01- seems to be "tighter".
   I considered the: Avalanche- too big for me, plastic funk. Nissan frontier- cheesy dash, slow. Dodge Dakota- less rear seat room, not as luxurious. All other vehicles seemed to start with a pickup and graft in some seats, while Ford's approach of adding a bed to the Explorer cabin yields more creature comforts and a fresher look.
   Finally, the price was right- $25,200- over $2600 off sticker and 0% for 60 mo. If you are considering the ST visit  mysporttrac.com  for exhaustive analyses of every facet of this impressive vehicle.
