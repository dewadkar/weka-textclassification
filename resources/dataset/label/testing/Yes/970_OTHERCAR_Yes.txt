            When i was looking over digital cameras (as expensive as they are), i saw one that looked interesting, it was the Richo RDC-4200.  It looked strange because it had a view lens that rotated 180ï¿½ and came with alot of things.  It only had a 4 meg Flash card, but can be easily upgraded to more, and it had a video that came with it and two great photoshop type programs that let you edit your pictures in many ways.  The price is reasonable for a camera that takes 1280X786 resolution pictures and looks excellent even at 640x480.  It has a flash and can take black and white pics and sepia ones also.  For those of you that want to take a picture of yourself, it also has a self timer.  For the bundle, this is one great package at a great price which makes the Ricoh RDC-4200 my favorite digital camera.<br><br>
