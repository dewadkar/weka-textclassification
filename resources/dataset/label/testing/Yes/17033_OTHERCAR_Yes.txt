            Ah, Durango!  What a great riding SUV!

For a while I thought the Jeep Cherokee was the best looking SUV on the road, especially in red, but the Durango, in any color at all, has it beat.  What a great looking vehicle.  The coolest looking SUV by far.  Not too big, but masterful-looking none the less.

And what a ride!

We rented a Durango for a week of rambling around the West.  We could not have made a better choice.  Its easily adjustable seats were incredibly comfortable.  The spouse and I are not good car travelers.  We get restless easily.  But not on the Durango trip.  We settled down quickly and enjoyed the ride.

The interior was roomy, with lots of space for luggage.  The front seat gave everyone lots of room.  And so did the back seat. Our son, who is just about 6' tall, accompanied us on parts of the trip.  We took turns in the back seat, and all of us were completely comfortable.

The Durango ran perfectly, the climate control provided even heat in the back and the front, and winding, steep hills were no problem at all.

Best of all, the car made even the longest stretches of empty road fun to drive.<br><br>
