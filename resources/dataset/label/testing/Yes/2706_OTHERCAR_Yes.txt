            I purchased my 95 T100 W/ 75k on it The truck now has 88k and runs very well. I purchased the vehicle after retiring my 85 4runner. I am an avid toyota enthusiast and consider the T 100 an excellent truck. I recently replaced the rear springs with some custom made springs and I also installed some custom torsion bars. The truck now rides firm but not stiff and carries a load much better. The truck also sits about 2&quot; higher now.This was a very worthwhile upgrade for me, the stock suspension was not acceptable for a mid/full size truck.
What I love about the vehicle: looks , 3.4L 4cam direct ignition hemi head engine is race car inspired but has excellent torque and horsepower, mileage is good too, since suspension upgrades truck handles great on and off road, very roomy interior and high quality paint job. I also like the fact that these trucks are not as common as the tacoma, it certainly can be a hard to find truck.
What I dislike: Clutch pedal brackets will break on all 5 spd. T 100s, Annoying front end creak (must be bushings), reverse gear is way too fast, Horn button is way to big, stock suspension is weak/shocks are tiny,the bed on my truck is developing cracks on the floor by the front bed mounts.
I use synthetic engine/drivetrain oils and have noticed better shifting and MPG. I also installed a K&amp;N Air filter which I believe is worth every cent. I try to keep the truck clean underneath, my worst fear for this trucks longevity is rust. This is a never ending battle here in northern New England.<br><br>
