            I purchased this camera as my first venture into digital photography.

If you are going to buy a digital camera, be prepared to buy all the extras that you will need. You have to buy rechargable batteries, a camera case and a larger memory stick. This will add up to around another $100.00.

The directions for the camera were clear to quickly learn how to point and shoot and then download into the computer.

The flash takes forever to recharge, but the flash is necessary. Otherwise you get dark, fuzzy pictures. Sure the dark pictures can be made lighter on the computer, but then they come out all grainy.

The auto-focus is tricky at times. Make sure that the focus frame is on the subject. Even the slightest movement during the focus phase will cause the picture to come out blurry. 

The camera hooks quickly into the computer via the USB port. The download is easy. If you really want to play with the pictures, then you will need to buy a better photo editor like Microsoft Picture-It.

When printing the pictures, be sure to purchase photo paper that is 8 1/2" x 11" where the picture can be "punched" out of the paper. Most printers and programs have trouble handling photo paper that is smaller.

The pictures can take up a lot of memory on your computer, so if you have a CD-RW drive, be sure to move the pictures off your computer and onto a disk.

All in all...a good first digital camera.
