            I love this car.  There is no question about it, and not qualifiers needed.  I bought my 1989 Toyota Celica GT two years ago this month.  I have purchased cars that were older and younger than this one and this one is the only car that has been wonderfully trouble-free.  I have only had to have routine maintenance done and I think that that is wonderful.  It drives superbly.  The ride and pick-up are excellent.  It is zippy and provides excellent mileage.  City and highway mileage at the age of 12 is still incredible at 26/33.  I believe that the key to maintaining a keeping a car of this age is to maintain it well, and don't mistreat your car.  I treat mine like a member of the family, and it has proven to be wonderfully beneficial.

My car is the 2-door GT sedan (which Toyota sadly does not make any longer).  Taller people have trouble getting into it, and if you are over 5 foot there is no way you will fit in the back seat.  My daughter is about the only one who rides back there.  The sunroof works excellent and the factory radio is still going strong.  I never have any trouble finding parts or people to fix it, and it truly is a joy to own and drive.

This car has smooth steering and corners unbelievably well.  The engine is a magnificent workhorse that will probably run for another 180,000 miles.  The car already has 136,000 miles on it, and I trust it to take me anywhere, anytime I want to go.  This definitely a car for a single or a couple.  If you have a family, then this definitely not the car for you.  It has short headroom, and no space in the backseat.  However, if you are looking for a wonderful little zippy sportscar, then this is most assuredly the car for you ... no matter which year you buy.  <br><br>
