            This car is awesome.  I may not be the best person to take advice from, just being a 16 year old who just got his license.  But i know this car is great.  It is a black 1998 model, but i don't see much difference from the newer models.

It has a V6 engine and is four doors with leather interior.  It came with a CD player already installed.  It has a rear spoiler and a sunroof. It has enough room for a family of 5 and is very roomy.  It has a very large trunk and seats that fold down in the back for extra long packages.

This car has great speed and power.  It handles great and hugs all the turns.  If you are looking for a nice car, not to big, and not to small, this is the one.  This car has also got consumer reports best buy.  It has been rated among the top midsize cars out there.  This car is great.<br><br>
