            I used to associate Kodak with film, not camera, because I found their products to be unequal to other names in the business. But Kodak is really keeping up in the digital technology, in my opinion. The DC240 Zoom is a decent camera, pricey, but you get great resolution and the zoom is better than the DC265, which was more expensive(originally). It has a color LCD for review and preview, again, like the more expensive model, plus the optical viewfinder. The focal length is about a 39-117mm, again very comparable to higher priced digitals, and it has 4 flash modes with a range up to 9.8'. It comes with the Kodak 8MB picture card, and is compatible with most systems.<br><br>
