            Aftyer careful consideration of my vehicle purchase , I decided , based on information given to me , and consumer reports to purchase my 2000 Ford Explorer Sport .

I have owned this vehicle less than one year , and have tallied up a little over 8000 miles on this auto .

Due to an defect in the engine system , although Ford doesnt at this point want to recall this engine , nor do they really want to deal with it either , I have a loud knock in my engine ... why ???

I was told by my dealership after having my car for 4 days that it is said by Ford that simply , some Sports do this others dont .
They build up massive ammounts of carbon on your pistons and Wha La .. youhave a knock . Of course Ford can remove the knock ( I can to with 50 Wt motor oil )but they refuse to look any farther into why this occurs .

I am looking forward to the next 5 years on my lease of nothing but engine hassles and even though it is covered on an extended warranty , well the hassles remain .

Also Ford custmer service center is basically a paper trail office set up why ? because the Government requires it to be there .
The customer service is non exsistant and basically you are told you are at the mercy of the dealer , even though Ford develops the guidelines the dealer must follow .
They dont care about the customers at all .. they just want your money .
If you have the extra 30,000 dollars and want to take a chance on this vehicle , go ahead . If your like me and really cant fathom the idea of a 440 a month car payment and spending 30,000 on a less than adequate vehicle STAY AWAY FROM FORD .
The topper , the customer service and solutions that the Ford Motor Company comes up with are less than adequate , and basically they just dont have the time to listen , nor investigate these complaints , at least thats what RHODA , the supervisor at customer care ( Thats a joke ) told me .
