            For anyone who's serious about getting a better car, this is it.  You could spend thousands more and not get anything significantly better than a nicely-equipped Toyota Corolla.  Sure, you won't get a 10-speaker stereo system, a full leather interior, or 0-60 in 4 seconds.  What you will get is a wonderful car that's extraordinarily fun to drive and whose reliability is legendary.  The new Corollas are even pretty darn attractive to look at.

I just got a 1999 Toyota Corolla CE as a replacement for my 1989 Corolla DX.  My mom just got a 2000 and is on her fourth Corolla.  Some things are different -- the newer ones are 4-speed instead of 3-speed, they have a 125-hp engine, it rides much smoother...But down to the core, it's the same old Corolla, only more fun.

Everyone I know who's had an older Corolla has gotten at least 120,000+ or so miles out of it without any major problems.  With that kind of reliability and now that they're about as fun to drive as anything else out there, there's absolutely no reason to get anything else.<br><br>
