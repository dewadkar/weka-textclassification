            The Camry VXLE &amp; V6LE

The Camry may not look like a fancy car, but it sure does run well. With a V6 Engine and ABS brakes it goes really fast and corners very well. It's acceleration is perfect for the freeway. When you come on to an onramp you need to go from like 25-60 in a few seconds. The Camry does that with no problem. 

Inside its equipped with a 6 speaker stereo and a Cd-Player leather/cloth seats the back seats move down to get into the trunk without getting out of the car.

When the car is off and the doors are closed the headlights automatically turn off. when all the doors are closed and locked someone sneaks in through the sunroof . If he tries to unlock the doors they'll automatically lock again. If the driver door doesn't open to get in. The car wont start, So you cant go through a different door or the something.

These are some great features of the Camry.
