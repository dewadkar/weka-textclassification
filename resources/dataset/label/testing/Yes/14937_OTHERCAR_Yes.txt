            I bought the Digital Mavica MVC-FD73 for my mother about one year ago to help her with her Ebay company.  A digital camera is a wonderful and handy thing for someone who puts up 15-30 auctions per week up on Ebay. (Shameless Plug - Check out her auctions, UserId is atticus14.)  She uses her camera an endless amount every week and I use it occasionally with my friends.

<b>Notable Functions</b>

* Extremely light weight - Not so much so that you don't know that its on you, but it's not a burden.

* Carrying Case / Shoulder Strap - Convenient and helps protect camera.

* 10X Zoom - A year ago this was one of the best in it's class.  Now, it's decent, useful - just not top-of-the-line.

* Picture Effect Option - Adds an artsy touch as it changes color affects of the picture that is about to be taken.

* Self Timer - Great for family and friend photos!

* Flash - Lights up the picture more than an actual flash at the time the picture is taken.  This also helps serve to light up the screen showing what you are about to photograph.

* LCD Screen - Easily visible, shows exactly what the picture will look like before it's taken.

* Compression/Quality - 20 better end quality pictures fit on one 1.44 MB 3.5 disk.  Also, several types of quality can be chosen from BMP, HQ JPG to LQ JPG.

* Extended Battery Time - After a full charge the lithium battery will last 210 minutes.  



<b>Pros</b>

One of the major pros to having the Mavica MVC-FD73 is that you save on developing fees.  Also, the pictures are already in digital form which means that sending them to family members and friends is a complete cinch.  These cameras are great for people who are setting up their own webpages, commercial or personal, or for people who are into online auctions who need to market their products - like my mother.  Hey, what can you say?  It cuts out the aggrivating process of scanning.

<b>Cons</b>

It only really saves on developing fees if you take a whole bunch of pictures.  The camera is a bit costly at $499 dollars.  (It's about $460 now as newer models have been released.)  You would have to take a whole lot of pictures before the price actually balanced out.  The only other real down-side to this camera is that the quality isn't the same as a real picture.  It's still a computer graphic (be it jpg or bmp) and while the quality is outstanding it's not real life photography.  

Over all this is a good purchase for people who have a specific purpose for a digital camera or for people who take an immense amount of pictures.  Setting up a website that is going to be chock-full of pictures?  This camera is for you.  Photoholic and you spend 100 dollars a month on developing?  This camera is for you.  Some kind of weird pervert who takes pictures of people when they aren't looking and it would be illegal to develop them?  This camera is for you. (I'm kidding, it's a joke... everyone relax.)  Average individual who only develops 100 dollars worth of pictures in a year?  Stick to disposable cameras.
