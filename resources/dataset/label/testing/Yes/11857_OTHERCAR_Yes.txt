            Nice package: Honda Civic Sedan LX, 2002

Pros:
Powerful and economic engine
Surprisingly spacious

Cons:
Seems less solid that comparable models
Honda insistence on their own maintenance fluids

I leased this car near end of 2002 model year to get advantages of seasonal incentives and I wish at times that I was able to buy it instead. Powerful and thrifty engine, although not as powerful as Toyota Corolla's. You can use any 86 to 93 Octane gas, other than the ones that are too enriched with ethanol. We only have to do scheduled maintenance on it. Being Honda a more cutting-edge company, they design their products with slightly more exacting mechanical specifications. Miles per gallon figures were excellent, thanks in part to it's U-LEV engine design technology in addition to their 4-speed automatic transmission.
Civic's ride is quite confortable and soft with tire-pressure set per user's manual, stability in cross-winds and high speed curves is solid and the interior is surprisingly spacious for a car of it's class specially for rear-seat passengers. I suspect that this due, in part to the elimination of the mid-cabin floor tunnel that many rear-wheel drive and even several front-wheel drive cars still have. Hey, you both American and Foreign car makers, why you need this hump stuck in the middle of the passenger cabin on front-wheel drive cars? Remember: no more front to rear axle!
The only gripe that I really have is that the metal stock for the body seems softer than others. It can be easily dented. And it can use more resistant paint. It tends to scratch easily, too. If you tend to over inflate tires 5 psi over recommendations, you may get more miles per gallon, but ride will turn rougher. And, last Honda insists on their dealer supplied motor oil (5W-30, due to more exacting mechanical specifications) and radiator fluid over any other brands with same grade.
My overall impression is quite favorable. The Civic should fill the bill even for those souls that like high-speed curve taking driving style. As a lease return, this is model should provide years of service if taken due care of it. Remember: Honda engineering is more "avant garde" than other manufacturers.
