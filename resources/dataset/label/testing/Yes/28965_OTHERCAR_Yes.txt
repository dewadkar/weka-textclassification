            Oh, how I hesitated to give up the solid and reliable 1996 Mazda Protege for a......Hyundai!?  The minute I signed the papers and forked over the keys to my Mazda, a sinking feeling in my gut told me what a fool I was.  But, 10 months and 10,000 miles later, the feeling in my gut has subsided.

I wanted a car befitting my leap from adolescence to adulthood; no more tiny cars.  But a Camry or Accord, a Taurus or Lumina, a Grand Prix or Regal?  All too financially burdensome for this high school teacher.  So for a time, I allowed the excellent Mazda Protege to cart me around.  Loved the car.  Wanted more exciting styling, more room, and more power.  But not more payments.

Hyundai offered me a warranty, a low payment, and a great looking car (I submit that the Koreans currently beat everyone on the planet in terms of making vehicles that look good).  I was surprised to learn how quiet this 4 cylinder standard Sonata drove on the highway.  Amazed.  Cruise control, power locks, windows, mirrors.  Good sound system with tape and AM/FM.  

I found a Sonata that indeed looked great, drove well, and offered mid-size roominess.  It also lowered my monthly payments by about $40 from the Mazda. 

Initially two problems with the interior scared me.  The passenger front window would not quite seal when closed, causing wind noise.  This was fixed free of charge of course and has not re-occurred.  One sun visor had a clip that snapped off.  That was also fixed immediately and free of charge.  That has been the extent of my problems with Hyundai.

I have driven the car through desert and mountain, snow and heat, and I have absolutely nothing but praise for its reliability and capabilities.  If I could have, I would have preferred a V6 because the 4 cylinder Sonata is no power horse when climbing steeply.  It does, however, beat my Mazda.

This car is a viable option.  Do not react to Hyundai's (partially deserved) reputation.  It is a relevant and attractive addition to those familiar cars such as the Camry, Accord, Taurus, Galant, Malibu, etc.  Don't pass it up without test driving it.  You will be surprised.
