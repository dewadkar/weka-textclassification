            I love my mtnr... I was shopping for an explorer but found this by accident. My mileage isn't as bad as most - I get 20mpg... downside would be the stability on the road - it tends to bounce and weave a bit on the open road - on poor roads though it sails! I am a youth pastor and this vehicle really works hauling kids and stuff around - plus for gigs I can fit a drum set, a bass, a bass amp, and stands all in there without scratching anything - I have even slept in it in Mexico instead of staying in a tent - and it was comfy.  My brake release broke off and the plastic shield next to the driver seat broke, but the truck is great! For a five year old SUV people still think its new (the dealer card on the front plate helps) - and everyone tends to appreciate it - it is a very beautiful truck and it runs great - the only downside is the mileage in this gas gouging time, but its all good - I reccommend it over the explorer - it seems to have a tad lower resale value off the lot but you get an explorer XLT for it, so bonus!
