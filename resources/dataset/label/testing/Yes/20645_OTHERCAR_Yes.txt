            this is a great car. it pulls like a v10, but does not guzzle as much gas. it handles so well that it can not be compared to almost anything out there on the road. inside is as beautiful as outside. it has a lot of room all over and can carry many things. the font and back have enough room combined for at least five people. the shocks are so good that you do not feel any bump. the insulation is built well so that the engine noise and other noises do not come into the car. its looks and its handling are the best features. usually i have seen this car being driven by college students and high school seniors but its for everyone. <br><br>
