            I have been the owner of a Plymouth Acclaim for about 8 years. When I was making my decision, I also looked at the Ford Tempo as well as some smaller and larger cars. These two cars were about the same size and price, and had many of the same features. For a family, the Acclaim is a much more suitable car. 

The Plymouth Acclaim isn't the most reliable car on the road, but isn't terrible. I would be wary of buying a really old Acclaim, but it really depends on the specific car. As my Acclaim ages, it does to the shop more, but I put many miles on mine. It's easily past 100,000 miles. 

The engine is fairly quick. I have the 2.5L four-cylinder with eight valves and one overhead cam. It's not real advanced, but with the manual transmission, it moves well and gets good gas mileage. The handling is not great, but I never feel jarred in the car. It is pretty heavy, so in does hold its ground. The suspension is also good. I have never tested the handling or suspension in a real racing/performance environment, but I have never had a problem or felt uncomfortable in normal driving. If you are looking for a used family car, this is a good bet.  

The Acclaim has a very spacious interior. The back has the most room of any car I have been in. The cabin is just big. If you have kids who are large for their age, or just want extra room, this is a good car to look at. The car doesn't steal this room from the front seats. They are also spacious and have great seats. The seats don't hold occupants as much as I like, but they are big and comfortable. The controls are all in obvious places, with the exception of parking break, which is near the break pedal. There are many storage spaces, like in most Chrysler cars. 

The Acclaim (used model) can be purchased at a low price, and is probably worth it, if the car is in fair to good shape. The space of the car is really the biggest plus and the reliability is the aspect which you should be most cautious about. 

Note: When I first bought the Acclaim, I didn't make many trips to the shop, but now they are more frequent.<br><br>
