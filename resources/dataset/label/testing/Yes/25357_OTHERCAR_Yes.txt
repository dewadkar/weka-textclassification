            Tha AGFA CL30 is a good camera at a great price. I researched and tested several digital cameras in this price range, and the CL30 came out on top, so I plunked down the $300 to buy one.

The first thing you notice about the CL30 is that the LCD screen is nice and clear and bright, giving a clear preview of your shot. Unfortunately, this LCD also eats batteries voraciously, we get about 20 pictures to 4 AA batteries. Note: If you buy this camera, pick up some rechargeable batteries and a recharger, it will save you money.

The camera has several options for flash, timer, image quality and so forth. These options are nice in a camera in this price range, and give you plenty of flexibility. 

The software bundled with the camera provides an easy-to-use interface between the CL30 and your computer. AGFA's Photowise software is very accessible to new users. Images can be rotated and touched up in a matter of seconds. The CL30 attaches to the computer with either a serial (PC) or USB (PC or Mac) cable, and pictures download from the camera relatively quickly.

Unfortunately, the camera only comes with a 4 MB CompactFlash card, the memory in the camera that holds the images until they are downloaded to the computer. This doesn't hold many photos at high resolution, but works well for website photos or e-mail snapshots.

It's been almost a year that I've had our CL30, and I have no major complaints. If it had more memory in the CompactFlash card, it would be perfect.<br><br>
