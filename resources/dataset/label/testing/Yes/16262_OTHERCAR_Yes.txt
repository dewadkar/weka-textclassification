            We leased this vehicle after driving a Saturn for three years.  My thoughts were that, since we had a baby on the way, we couldn't go wrong with a Toyota.  They have a good reputation for durability and safety, and I thought it would be a little bigger to better accommodate a carseat.

Well it's actually smaller with less leg and head room than I had anticipated.  My husband is 6 feet tall and fits OK, but one couldn't be much taller or the person sitting in the back seat will have absolutely no leg room.

We have the high end LE model with the Touring Package which includes a special amber-lit instrument panel, sunroof, cd player, auto windows, cruise, etc.  We are happy with everything so far, but I have seen other cars that I consider to be &quot;better&quot; cars advertised for less than what we paid for the Corolla (such as a Jetta).

It's a nice car to drive...very quiet and smooth.  We found the stock tires to be lacking in grip from the start, but other than that, everything is holding up very well so far.  We may have paid a little more, but like they say, I guess - you get what you pay for.<br><br>
