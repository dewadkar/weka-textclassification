            This car is one of the fastest cars i have ever been in. My aunt just purchased a brand new 3000gt, and boy do i love this car. She let me test drive it one day i took it out on the parkway and the power and acceleration is unbelievable. I have one complaint about this car is the back se3at has very little room and is not a car for a big family or a person who is over six feet tall because you will really be cramped. The car is very comfortable in the front seat and is a great sports car for half the price. The handeling ability on this car is very good it could turn on a dime. It is soo hard to tell how fast you are going because the ride in this car is smooth like any other.<br><br>
