            The 1991 Chrysler LeBaron, in my opinion, is one of the better cars on the road today.  Taking in the consideration of it's gas usage alone, any other car in it's class does not come close.  Origionally built as an affordable alternative to larger, more expensive 'upper-crust' vehicles, the LeBaron should not be passed by as just another 'econo' car.
The interior, built to withstand high usage, was excellently done by the company.  Rugged, yet elegant, carpeting, plush seat material and durable accessories are just the start of what you will find inside.  Depending on what grade of model you are considering, rest assured, only quality parts were used in their construction.
The exterior of the vehicle does experience the otherside of the 'good/bad' spectrum.  The paint used by Chrysler/Mopar in the early 1990's  was under par in conparison to similar models of other automakers.  The paint will typically begin to 'peel' and 'flake' in portions of the car that are not normally prone to wear and tear.  These areas may include the roof, trunk lid and hood.  To help prevent against this, regular washing and waxing is personally recommended.  Just as a side note tip, if you are experiencing this on a small scale, and you car is of a common color used by other automakers, try using touch-up paint or even nail polish to cover these blemishes.  Make sure to check to see if any rust has formed first before application.  Underneath the car also has some issues.  The transmission being the main problem.  Chrysler/Mopar, in my own personal belief, designed the transmission in hast, not taking in account of drivers actually 'using' the cars to their full extent.  If you do experience difficulties in shifting, such as 'sticky gears', or hesitation from one gear to anther (like myself and many others did), be sure to have a professional take a look at this problem before it supernovas into an expensive replacement.  If replacement is the only option, expect to pay from 1,000.00 to 1,850.00 for a quality rebuilt or reconditioned transmission.  Any type of extra weight, weather it exists within the car or toeing a trailer, watch out!  Make sure to check the transmission fluid before during and after such an event.  It would not be a bad idea to have the transmission drained and filter replaced every 10k miles if you are using the car to haul or pull heavy items.
All in all, for long trips or short runs the 91' LeBaron is an excellent choice for any driver who wants to experience a quality automobile at a reasonable cost.
