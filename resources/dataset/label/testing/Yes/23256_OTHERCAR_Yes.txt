            I bought this vehicle new in 1995. I wanted a sport car, and I needed a back seat. Although I have always had manual transmissions, my wife was going to use the car as well. So, I found a deal on an automatic and took it for a test ride. Well after driving it, I HAD to have it! It was exactly what I was looking for.
I had the cars for 5 years and it was one great automobile. Loads of fun, zero major problems, some minor normal things that happen to any car over a 5 year period.
What I loved about the car was its build quality, performance, style.
What i was not pleased with were cost of service work performed after the warranty, and even though performance was great handling wise and steering feel, it was under powered for a $40,000 car. Europe had the 320 horsepower version, while the US had a 240 horsepower version. I never did understand that. I have heard all of the explanations and I don't buy them. When you have Acura's and GMC Jimmy's beating you at the stop light.........The point is, I am sure the manual performed better, but at $40,000 I feel at the time (1995) 280 or more would have been more appropriate.
The M3 did shine though, in the curves and twisties in the North Georgia mountains, and it has the best brakes in the business, except for maybe Porsche. Overall, it was an entertaining ride, it was pretty quick and I know BMW has answered the Horsepower situation with the new yet to be released and long waiting list 2001 M3.
The new one will really be an M car to reckon with!
If you are looking at a used one of these - I would go with manual of course and low miles - and you will have yourself a superb German engineered car that has razor sharp handling, great road feel, tight suspension, quick acceleration, and style.<br><br>
