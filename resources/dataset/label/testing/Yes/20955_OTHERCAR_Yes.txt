            We've had our Cruiser for about 6 months now, and we've found very little that we don't like about it. Although it doesn't bother us personally, the biggest complaint we've heard about it is it's sluggish accelerator. It looks like it would be fast but it's really not. Our car is a family car though so we have no reason for anything with too much power. It was a good compromise for us because we originally wanted an SUV so we'd have plenty of room to tote large items around, but we couldn't find an SUV we liked in our price range. The cruiser is great because it's comparable in price to a sedan, but the seats are so versatile that we can fit practically anything we want to into our car. The front seat folds down completely flat and we've found that more useful than we first thought it would be. With the front seat folded down we let our dog ride there so he doesn't scratch the seats, and our son can see out the front window of the car from his car seat. We ordered the limited edition with all the upgrades we could get. We were unsure about how we would like the leather in the car, but so far it's been easy to clean up and still doesn't show any wear. One of our favorite things about the car is that all the seats have plenty of leg room. It is very irritating to me to be in the back seat of a car and feel cramped, there is no problem with leg room in the cruiser though. We are also really happy with our gas mileage, it really helps out with the high gas prices.
