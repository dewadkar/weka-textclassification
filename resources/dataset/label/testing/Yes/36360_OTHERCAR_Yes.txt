            I bought this vehicle because it has a great look to it and many of my friends have it and they have said what a graet car it is.  It gets good gas milage and the space that is in the trunk is tremendous.  I have has this car for about 5 years and have had hardly any problems with it.  The new Honda Accords are awesome.  The new design and look are wonderful and i reccommend it.  If you have a lot of kids you shouldn't buy this car though because the room in the back is not to big.<br><br>
