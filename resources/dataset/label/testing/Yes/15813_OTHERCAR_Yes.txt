            When my husband and I started looking for a car to replace my Ranger, I had never heard of the Solara.  In fact, it was the last vehicle that we test drove. 

The first thing I noticed about the car was that the ride was very smooth and quiet.  We could have a normal conversation while driving at highway speeds.  The back seat was roomy, for a two door car.  And since it is a new type of car, there are not very many in town (not like say, a Grand Prix).

Since the purchase, I have put over 10,000 miles on the car.  We have yet to experience any problems with it, and have received many compliments from friends and co-workers.  I even rode for four hours in the back seat (I'm about 5' 5&quot; tall), and it was more comfortable than I expected.

I have driven the Solara in large cities and rural roads, in rain and snow.  I have no complaints about how it handles in the snow (just like most other front wheel drive vehicles I have driven), and the anti-lock brakes are fine.  The car accelerates very well, making it easy to get on a freeway or pass.

The one thing that almost turned me off about the car was it's styling.  It was not something that I though I would buy.  However, it still is very unique in my area, and the design has grown on me.  The other issue is that the mileage isn't as good as I would like.  I suppose that is due to the V6.

The trunk fit luggage for 4 for an extended weekend, and two sets of golf clubs plus luggage for 2.<br><br>
