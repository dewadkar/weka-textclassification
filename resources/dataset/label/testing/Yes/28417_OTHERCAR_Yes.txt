            When I bought my first Maxima back in 1995, I new I am getting a great deal for the money, but I had no idea that I was getting a sports car as well as a very luxurious sedan. The Nissan Maxima at that time was compared to Toyota Camry, Mazda 626 and Honda Accord. Even though they are all very good cars, they do not stand a chance considering the performance, speed, luxury, options and even the price. The Maxima was definitely a greatest buy.

In 1998, I had a chance to lease another vehicle and once again I ended up with the Maxima for the obvious reasons. No other car came close for the money I paid and the options I got.

My lease is coming to the end next year and I can't wait to get my hands on the new model. The 2000 model has luxury and even more boost. Even before, I thought that the Maxima had plenty of power and torque, but now that they made it 222 hp, I bet it is even more appealing and even a better buy. Once you drive Maxima, it is very hard to switch for another car in that price range
