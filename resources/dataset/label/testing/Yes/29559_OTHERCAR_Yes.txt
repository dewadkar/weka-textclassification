            My 91 Dodge Stealth RT is an important asset. The reason I bought my Stealth is because it has always been my dream to own a sports car (Stealth in particular).Well, my dream has come true and it is almost everything I expected. I bought my Stealth off the internet for a measly $8,600.00. She only had 49,000 miles on her. When I went to see her.....she stood out like a sore thumb. She was red, looked like brand new, and drove even better. I had always been afraid to drive faster than like 70 miles per hour. That was until I bought her....now I can reach speeds in the 100's without even being able to notice it. She feels so secure and well built...I never pay attention to how fast I'm going. I feel invincible. She's quick and sweet. Everyone looks at her in envy. I feel proud to be an owner of a Stealth. Don't get me wrong, I have had a few problems with her, but my warranty covered it all almost. The worst problem I have right now is my muffler, which will be fixed soon. She was pretty badly abused when I got ...which I didn't raelize until I got her home, but with a little TLC she got better. As long as you treat them well they will treat you well. I wouldn't get rid of her for the life of me.<br><br>
