            I have used a sony digital camera now for two years.We have an antique market and to be able to send take a picture of  a piece to either send it to a customer or to give them the disk to take it home is so simple.I don't even use a poloroid any more.
Usually I just take the shot and e-mail it to them and it is waiting for them when they get home. They don't have to worry about losing the photo.
There are cameras that are smaller and some that hold more pictures,but the ones with the flash cards are more complicated to use and the flash cards are expensive if you lose or break it. With my sony I just take any old or new floppy I have around and use it They only hold about half the photos,but look how cheap floppies are these days.Plus their are no cords or special connections to use. Just pop it out of the camera and pop it in the computer. It just can't get any easier.There are some that are cheaper in price,but This camera is worth the money.<br><br>
