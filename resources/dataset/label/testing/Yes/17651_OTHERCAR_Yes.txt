            This car is my third Volvo, so that should tell you something about Volvos - people who buy one usually continue to buy them, and there's good reason why.

My first Volvo, a 79 station wagon that my parents bought me in college, was totaled in an accident in which someone hit me in the driver's side at about 45 mph.  I walked away very shaken but physically unharmed; as soon as I started looking for a new car, I was reading the "Volvo" section of the classifieds.

My second was a 1985 740 GLE, which was a wonderful car, but of course as it approached 200,000 miles, all of the parts that wear out did and they cost a good deal to repair.  A few months ago, I made the decision to stop THINKING about getting a new car and actually DO it.  My old 740 would get another 100,000 miles, I am sure, but I wanted to go ahead and make a long-term investment in a new(er) car.

So I began searching, my number-one criterion being that the car be a STICK SHIFT.  I live in the Bay Area, where apparently no one wants a clutch, so I was getting a bit desperate.  There were so few (newer) stick shifts out there besides the overpriced offerings of dealerships.  And then one day, I found the ad -

I didn't know a lot about the 850 model but the ad sounded good so I went and looked at the car.  After a quick test drive I offered the guy a deposit so that he wouldn't sell it to anyone else, and we struck a deal shortly thereafter.

Why is this the best car in the world?  Well, I should start by saying that THIS ONE is not a standard 850 GLT.  The original owner, the woman before the guy I bought it from, had every last option put on the car.  It's got a spoiler, leather interior, premium 8-speaker sound system, 6 CD changer, alarm and remote entry, cold weather package (heated seats, headlight wipers, TRACS traction control system, front AND REAR foglights) on top of everything else.  I love that this car has power EVERYTHING, dual climate control, huge trunk, rear seats that fold down (if I ever need to put something really big in the trunk), dual airbags AND side airbags, all the child features such as safety locks on the back doors and car seat adjustments on the seatbelts (if I ever need to have kids in the car).

I bought this car in early May and began driving it about a week later, after it was registered.  In less than three months, I have put over 6,000 miles on it because I LOVE DRIVING IT. It has great power and acceleration, tight steering, and is very quiet inside.  It's getting a bit squeaky and rattly here and there, but I can live with that.  I guess it may be a bit bumpy on uneven surfaces, but I don't really mind that because the seat is SO COMFORTABLE, what with the lumbar support and nice leather.  I took this car on a road trip through the South West this summer and let me tell you: the air conditioner was awesome, instant ice-cold air - so cold in fact that I often had to turn it down; the engine never overheated, not in the slightest, and I didn't even have to add fluids; and, even using the air conditioner frequently, the car got upwards of 30 mpg!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I have found that this car does really good with gas mileage at higher speeds.  If I travel at 75 mph or faster, it can get up to 33 mpg. Not that I drive that fast, that's illegal :).

Anyhow, all in all, I am SO GLAD I bought this car.  I am going to keep this one until it dies!
