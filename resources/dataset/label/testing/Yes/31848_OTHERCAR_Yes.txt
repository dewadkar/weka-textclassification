               Being an avid photographer and looking to get into the digital camera market, Kodak let me demo the DCS-560 for a week to see if my company would like to purchase it.  After we tried it out, we fell in love with this camera and if you are a professional photographer and try this camera, you will as well!
   The features of the Kodak DCS-560 are quite numerous and elaborate.  First of all, The Kodak DCS-560 includes a 1.8 inch LCD (liquid crystal display) screen so you can see what the picture will be like before it is taken.  With this LCD screen, you can also change the amount of light in the picture, fix odd shadows that may be in the picture and add such things as the date and time as well.  You can also display up to 9 images in this LCD screen at once so you can see 9 pictures instead of the usual 1.  One of my favorite features of this camera is that you can create folders (through the use of the PC Card) and put specific pictures in there so that they are organized when you bring them back to your computer.  All the information one can need which included mode, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, lens focal length, exposure correction level, date/time stamp, and white balance is recorded automatically with the image file and is displayed when you open the file.
   The removable and rechargeable battery (which is included with the camera) stores up to 100 images and since it is rechargeable, you can take it anywhere anytime and if your battery dies, just recharge it!  With a 32 MB DRAM buffer, anyone can take a burst of 3 frames, 1 every second, before writing to the PC card, a very helpful feature!
   If you are a first time photographer looking for a digital camera, I do not think that this camera is for you because the features are too complex for a first time user.  If however, you are a professional  photographer, looking to purchase a digital camera give this one a chance, hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do!
