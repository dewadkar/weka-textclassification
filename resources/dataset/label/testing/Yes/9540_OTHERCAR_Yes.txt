            Toyota has reputation of making cars that are economical and far from flashy.  The Celica has been an exception for a number of years and the new model is no exception.  

I drove a 1993 Celica for the better part of six years and loved it.  I only wish that the new model would have been available when I was in the market for a car about a year and a half ago.  The new model is very sporty and, in my opinion, has taken on the look of the Lotus that appears in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.  At any rate, here is a look at what the new Celica has to offer:

*  16 valve DOHC (I have no idea what this means, but I know the Celica    really moves and this is a big reason why)
*  Power windows/locks/sun roof
*  Dual airbags
*  Anti- lock brakes
*  Power steering
*  CD/Cassette Player
*  Six speakers
*  

Ok, nothing out of the ordinary like the ability to lift off and fly over traffic, but a lot of the basic amenities that you look for in a car.  

What I like best about the Celica is that it is sporty, but not overstated.  In other words, you will turn heads, but you will not have a bunch of people looking at you and wondering how in the world you can afford such a car (i.e. the Porsche Boxster).  The Celica also has great pick up and handles like a dream.   Toyota also did a good job of placing the controls in an area where they can be accessed while keeping the eyes on the road.  Always a positive in my book.  

Additionally, the seats are quite comfortable and the the legroom is plentiful- especially in the front seat.  The two door car also truly offers a back seat.  In other words, two people can sit in the back of the car without being totally uncomfortable.  Finally, I have never had any sort of mechanical problems with the Celica and this goes back to the one I owned for many years.  It seems as if Toyota has managed to transfer their reliable parts and technology into a car that is pushes the upper end of the price range. 

What do I not like about the Celica?  Well, this is a search because there is not much that I would consider a negative.  The trunk is a little tight, but not tiny.  The wiper blades are not great when it comes to removing heavy grit, grime, or bugs.  Yes, they tend to smear a lot.  Finally, as with any sports car, the clearance is not great for those who are tall.  You will be bumping your head if you are over 6&quot;2, but you can always stretch your legs out since the car has more than ample leg room. In all honesty, these are about the only things that I have found that are not great with the new Celica.


I would recommend the new Celica, or the old model for that matter, to anyone who is looking for a sporty car with a reasonable price.  The Celica is reliable, fast, and will meet all of your basic needs- except for hauling seven kids.  Oh, and the back seat, well I think it would be best if you found out for yourself.<br><br>
