            Wow !  I haven't been so excited about driving in 20 years.  I just bought the my Jetta this weekend and I can't wait till I drive it again.
I traded in my 1997 Mitsubishi Montero Sport for this car.  the only
thing I miss, is my cargo space.  The car is a real pleasure to drive.
I strongly recommend you get the leather package for just a little more.
It feels very luxurious for a small price.  The trunk room is bigger
than what you would expect.

This car is a eye catcher.  Price was $18,200 nicely equipped.  here is
a list of things you can get for the price.
Alloy wheels, Leather seats, Sunroof, AM/FM/Cass w/6CD changer, keyless entry, alarm and 5-speed manual Trans.

I recommend this car to anyone who likes to have fun, but enjoys a 
little luxury for a small price.
