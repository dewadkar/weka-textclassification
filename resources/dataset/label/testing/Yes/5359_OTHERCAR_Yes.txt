            I bought my 1995 BMW 325IC from a certified used BMW dealer in 2000 with 46k miles and pristine condition. I have driven the car 16K miles since then with not one mechanical flaw/failure...knock on wood!

The car has been an absolute joy to drive, but I have no children or extras (other than my husband) to pack in the car. The front seats are roomy, and I can get four people in the car (including myself) but not for long drives. The 2.5 liter 6 cylinder engine is THE WAY TO GO with the 3-series...pickup is great and zippy...drives right by the 318.

One bummer about the car is the soft wheels that are on the car (as on most BMW's). When I hit a pothole going 30mph or so, I had to replace the wheel at about $490 each...but, nobody said BMW comes cheap. 

Other considerations that come to light when you are deciding to buy ANY convertible include the lack of trunk space...where do you expect the roof to go when it's down? Noise inside is another minor setback, but you get used to it. Sounds a little noisy and creaky compared to normal hardtop sedans, but not bad.

Overall, this car has been a joy to drive. We are living in the Colorado area now, and it's even actually very good to drive in the snow with ASC traction AND Bridgestone Blizzak tires...BUT don't go without the tires in the snow.

If you find this car, even being a 1995 model, you will be sweetly surprised.
