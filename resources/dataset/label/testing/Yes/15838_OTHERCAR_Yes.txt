            This camera is everything I expected from a $200 2MP non-zoom camera and more.  The features allow for great pictures in most conditions.  The Scene mode takes excellent night pictures.  The shutter lag is almost zero once you are in focus.  The picture quality is above average, but not the best in class.

The plastic LCD screen is difficult to clean and easy to scratch.  Also the USB/video cover seems flimsy, but hasn't been a problem yet.  It was difficult to get used to the "center" press of the 5-way control, but is not bothersome anymore.  Any editing by a windows program, even just rotating, renders the pics unreadable by the camera, which I use sometimes for slide shows on the TV.  I have not seen other cameras capable of this, but I would think some would, being they are just JPEGs.

If you think you want a zoom, do not consider this camera.  The digital zoom is completely worthless as I have had better results blowing them up on my PC.  The price on this camera has come down to $189 and is an even better value.  

I recommend the starter kit, as it gives you a much needed quick charger, extra batteries.  You will also want a bigger memory stick, you can get Lexar ones for less than the Sonys ($50-60 128MB), and they come with a better 5-year warranty to boot.  You can get $20 off any accessories from Sony when you register your camera online, and they also have an excellent free website to post full-resolution pics.
