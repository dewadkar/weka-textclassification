            To accommodate visiting family members, I rented a brand new 2000 Excursion from my local Ford dealer. With one of my family members 6'4&quot; I didn't feel we'd be comfortable in my beloved Explorer on an extended. Once inside the Excursion, I was immediately comfortable - not at all what I had expected. At 4'10&quot;, I had expected to feel dwarfed by the &quot;monster&quot; SUV everyone was talking about. Not at all! Everything was completely within reach, including the gas and brake pedals, which are even a stretch in my Explorer.

It ran very quiet, with passengers in the third row being able to converse at normal speaking levels while doing 70 mph down the highway. 

Off the highway, I did not feel like I was driving a vehicle as big as it is - it has a great turning radius, handles cornering well (within reason), and did not submarine over bumps.

 My family (Lincoln and F250 owners) were extremely pleased with the comfort, especially the wide door openings. This did prove difficult to get in and out of the vehicle in tight parking. In todays cramped parking areas, this vehicle will see alot of door dings and cramped parking spaces.

 The most innovative feature are the dual side mirrors, and I say dual because there are two mirrors on each side - a regular one on top and a smaller, more convex (?) mirror on the bottom to give extra side views. 

As for the mileage, we stayed around 17-18 mpg. The engine seemed very capable, very quiet, and you could hear little road noise inside the vehicle. The three doors that make up the tailgate were very easy to get used to, especially with my short stature. The two bottom doors have a dip in the middle, making it easy to reach in.

 In summary, the Excursion is pleasurable to drive, and gets alot of looks. Think twice before trying to park this in the driveway, however, ands hopping at the local superstore will bring you parking anxiety! I would recommend this vehicle, if you can justify needing the room, or just want to own the road.<br><br>
