            The Lexus IS 300

A Lexus-Beamer!

Of all the Lexus I have driven this is the one that least inspired me.

Not that it is a bad car, to me it is just as if the designers at Lexus ran out of ideas and decided to copy ideas from another automobile manufacturer, in this
case it would be BMW.

I feel that if they want anyone to spend close to $30,000.00 on their product the least they could have done is to try to give the car a character of its own.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

It is fairly easy to describe the Lexus IS 300, is a copy replica of the BMW 3-series. It has very similar exterior dimensions, an inline 6-cylinder engine with about the same characteristics and some interior features that resemble
enough the Beamer 3-series.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Once you open the doors you get an eye-full, the interior has a racecar look with aluminum pedals and a speedometer that looks more like a chronograph. I have to admit it is very well put together, the material used and the
workmanship is excellent.

Sitting behind the steering is comfortable; there is sufficient head and legroom for the average body person.  The all around vision is excellent maybe with the
exception of the vision from the rear window if you are backing-up. This is due to the higher trunk, which takes away from seeing close objects when backing up.

All the gages are well located and can easily is seen from the driverï¿½s position. Also all the controls and buttons are within easy reach.

One flaw I could see was the tight legroom for the rear seat passengers, but aside from that it has a beautiful interior.

The exterior:

The exterior dimension and style of the Lexus IS 300 does resemble a lot the dimension and style of the BMW 3-series, too much for me to say something
positive about it. 

I know that carmakers nowadays tend to copy the other fellow
popular design, but I think there should be a limit to how far they do that,

As far as I am concern, Lexus went over the limit here.

I also do not like too much the alloy wheel design, I think they could have come up with a nicer one. On the positive side I do like the wide side-view mirrors.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Under the hood of the IS 300 you will find:

Engine: A V-6, 3-liters DOHC developing 215 horsepower.
Transmission: A 5-speed automatic with E-Shift.

Safety: Driver, passenger and side airbags.
            Traction control.
            Child safety locks.
            Remote keyless entry.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Lexus IS 300 comes with an excellent selection of standard equipment to make the driving pleasant and comfortable. 

It is a fun car to drive, I had the opportunity to take on the highway and it does move quite well.

The only major thing that displeases me is that it looks too much like a Beamer.
