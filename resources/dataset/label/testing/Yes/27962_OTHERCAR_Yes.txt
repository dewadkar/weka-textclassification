            I lusted after this truck for months and finally purchased a new 2000 Tacoma 4x4 Regular Cab in November 1999, but I actually sold it at a loss shortly afterwards when the reality of truck ownership set in.

Other readers who think they're in love with this truck might benefit from  my experience. At least it would give them some pause, especially if they have never owned a pickup before (like me).

<b>My Truck Specs</b>
2000 Tacoma 4x4 Standard Cab
2.7 liter 4 cylinder engine
manual transmission
value package + convenience package
bucket seats, aluminum wheels, 265/75R15 tires,
A/C, cassette/stereo, tach, rear sliding window.

<b>Engine should have been a six</b>
The four cylinder performed well under normal city driving conditions. Shifting was like a truck with long throws and trouble engaging some gears. In retrospect, I would strongly recommend a potential buyer to consider the six cylinder engine. I chose the four because it had the same horse power (150hp) as the six cylinder used in pickups and 4Runners before the recent redesign. I needed to find reasons to keep the price down too.

As far as Toyota reliability goes, I've driven a Toyota Camry 1988 with 170,000 miles and it is still smooth and trouble-free. I know a Camry is not a Tacoma, but it proves to me that Toyota <i>knows</i> how to make great engines.

<b>Outstanding interior, mediocre seats</b>
The Tacoma had a great looking interior. The controls and dials were high quality and well placed compared to other compact pickups such as S-10, and Ranger. The fit and finish was superb with quality materials and properly approximated seams. Things I couldn't stand about other pickups were cheap plastics and buttons, and poorly fitting dash panels.

One problem I encountered had to do with the seats and the standard cab. The seats really needed to be beefier and more supportive. They were also placed so low that I got the impression I was sitting with my bottom on the floor of the cab. Because I got the standard cab, I also could not recline my seat back. This is a serious deficiency that I thought I could overlook, but the seating position became really uncomfortable after moderate drives.

<b>Is this the perfect vehicle?</b>
When I bought the truck, I thought it was a very practical decision. I am a student who moves frequently. I like to go camping and mountain biking.  I need an utterly bullet-proof engine. I commute to school with at most one other person. Since I didn't have a lot of money but wanted a &quot;fun&quot; car, the Tacoma seemed perfect. Was it?

<b>No.</b>
After a short while, I began realizing that I needed a different vehicle. Because of my truck fantasy, I overlooked many of the trade-offs that became apparent with use.

The compact bed is really not large enough to help me move much furniture or sleep in the great outdoors with. The standard sized cab didn't allow me to store much gear or groceries in a secure location. When I make long commutes, it really takes a toll on my tush as well as my pocket book. Although I enjoyed the great view from my 4x4, the truck wasn't as fast or responsive as I'd like in traffic.

<b>Tacoma is still a great truck</b>
Don't get me wrong. I still think the Tacoma is a great pickup. I would have preferred to get the V6 and the Xtra Cab version. I also think the seats could be better. When I compared Tacoma 4x4 to S-10/Sonoma, Ranger/B-series, and Frontier, it was no question in my mind that Tacoma was the way to go.

What I am trying to get across here is that I was so swooned by my truck fantasy, that I ignored all the things I came to dislike about owning a pickup in general. I wanted to contribute something so that other folks intoxicated by truck fantasies like I was, can come to grips with pickup reality. Let's face it, I am <i>not</i> a pickup person, and I don't want others to make my mistake too.<br><br>
