                I bought this car used in July 2000.  It had 47,500 miles on it.  I purchased this car because of its reputation.  This car is elusive with only 5,000 being made each year.  The chances of getting this car are very difficult.  If you manage to find one, you automatically enter into an exclusive group of SVT owner's. You could count how many you see in a month on one hand.  I have to say that the looks drew me in first.  The first time I saw it I was in awe.  I had never seen such a car.  So when I accidentally came upon one, I immediately called my wife down and we purchased the car that night.  
    
This car is fast with a very unique engine noise that is not easy to find on a V-6. The car is very tame until it gets into the power-band.  It takes a little peddle mashing to get the car into the power-band but once its there it stays in the power-band through all 5 gears. As soon as you hit it, the acceleration is explosive.  With 195 HP this car has all the power you could need.  The car handles like a dream.  I have yet to experience any understeer.  The only problems I have had are due to the lowering of the car which have put a lot of stress on the stock shocks.  Of course I found this out trying to chase a Porsche on a curvy mountain highway (speed limit 45mph) at 80 mph (not recommended!). The car is incredibly smooth at all speeds (even at 120mph; don't ask). It is also equipped with a short shift kit and performance clutch.  These two working together can make for some fun burn outs and quick shifting to keep up with those high priced BMW's.  
    
The interior has a very simple layout which is easy to use. The leather gives it a luxury look; although the midnight blue color takes a little getting used to.  I have heard many complaints about the location of the radio being to low but this has never bothered me. The seats are probably the most comfortable seats I have been in.  My wife gets sleepy every time she rides in the car, even short trips to the grocery store. 
    
There are some down points however.  The manual says that this car has a 16.2 gallon tank but I have never been able to get more than 12.5 gallons into it.  The gas mileage leaves much to be desired.  (Of course I am constantly pushing the car every day.)  I get about 17 in the city and 22-25 on the freeway.  That's not good.  On top of that, the SVT requires 91 octane gasoline.  With todays gas prices, this leaves a big hole in your wallet.  Also, the rear seat is not suitable for anyone taller than 5 feet.  Its bearable for short trips but forget about passengers getting any sleep on long trips.  There is a lot of noise coming from the clutch area during city driving.  It a little annoying but disappears at freeway speeds.
    
Overall, I think this car is worth the money.  If you have a big family and are using it for your main commuter this is probably not the car for you. It would probably appeal more to a male crowd (although I have seen some adventurous females behind the driver seat). It has a unique look that will be turning heads and you'll probably get tired of everyone asking, &quot;What kind of car is that!&quot;. (well maybe not) It's a four door sedan but with a racing engine.  This car could be called the affordable &quot;American&quot; BMW. Take it for a test drive and push it.  I guarantee that you will love it.  Visit www.contour.org for a more diverse look at the SVT.
