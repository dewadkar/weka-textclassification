            I bought this car used in 2001.  It was fresh off of a lease.  I really didn't shop for the car.  My car was falling apart, and this car happened to fall into my affordable range.  I test drove it and fell in love with it.

The car looks so sporty and stylish!  It rides like an expensive car.  It handles like a dream!  The transmission sometimes jumps between 0-15 mph.  That can be very annoying at times.  If you take your foot off the gas to hit the brake quickly, it jumps also.  Apparently this has happened to a lot of people I know who own this car, so I guess it's just a quirk.  The standard engine can be a little noisy at times, but that's ok.  Sometimes the pick-up can be a little sluggish, but once it gets up to where you need the speed to be, it's smooth sailing from there!  This car loves highway driving.

The interior is very roomy for the "average" person.  I have a friend who is like 6'3" and weighs almost 400 lbs, and needless to say, he's not too comfy in the car.  It's fine for me though.  I'm a big girl, but I'm short.  The car is very comfortable for me.  The factory CD/stereo is awesome.  Much better quality than I thought it would be.  I thought I was going to have to add a bass tube or a box in the trunk, but no need.  The speakers are good, but I am starting to notice just a tad bit of rattling if the bass on a particular song is too low.  It corrects itself after I adjust the bass.  I have taken many a road trip in this car, and it's very comfortable.

The car is very good on gas.  Maintenance is very basic.  I get my oil changed regularly every 3,000 miles.  I have had to replace the windshield wipers, front brakes, the battery and 2 tires (I had a spin-out-the car handled very well during the spin out!) 

The only gripe I have about this car isn't even related to the car.  It's related to the insurance rates for the car. This car can tend to be kind of expensive to insure.  When I asked my FORMER insurance about why my rates were so high for a Mazda, all she could say was that a Mazda was in the same insurance class as a Mercedes Benz!!!  Needless to say, I got rid of that insurance company!  The company I'm with now (Erie Insurance Company) has awesome rates and I'm very pleased!

Overall, this car is a very smart purchase.  It's a great-looking car.  It's quite sporty.  It's overall inexpensive.  Minor maintenance.  Solid construction.  Great sound system.  Great for the student all the way through to the senior citizen.

I highly recommend this car!
