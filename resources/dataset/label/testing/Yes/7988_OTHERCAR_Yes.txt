            I did a lot of research on cameras before deciding on the Minolta Dimage S414. I wanted a camera that was more than 4 mega pixels, had a decent optical zoom, the ability to attach lens filters/additional lenses, had manual features, and was priced reasonably. 

The Minolta GT zoom lens was a big deciding factor in my purchase, combining compact size with high quality. The camera can store images as TIFF uncompressed images, and for someone like me who is working with portraits, that is a great benefit. The manual features are great and offer plenty of flexibility, and the auto features are great for when you want to just point and shoot.

The macro on this camera is great, and when used with a macro lens and the focus lock, you can make some really interesting pictures. From the first pictures I took with this camera, I was impressed. 

The tripod mount is in a strange location, but it really doesn't effect the image quality or performance of the camera, so I can't list that as a con. If you turn the flash off in auto mode and then review the image in the PLAY setting, your changes won't be saved. On the right side of the camera, [looking from the back] the camera strap loop gets exactly in the way of the access door to the compact flash card, USB interface and A/V output. Once again, these things do not effect image quality, but are just things I have noticed.

After using the S414 for a week or so, I continue to be impressed by the image quality and ease of use of this camera. The menu functions in both auto and manual modes are intuitive and easy to navigate. I also purchased a lens kit for the camera that includes three lens filters [UV/Fluorescent/Polarizer], a 2X Telephoto lens and a Wide Angle lens. These have made an excellent addition to the camera, but are not needed to create stunning work.

The image quality shows excellent color depth, and the built in features like http://elsnaibs.com/cgi-bin/i/ashshoot/Ash03.jpg, http://elsnaibs.com/cgi-bin/i/ashshoot/Ash08.jpg and sharp color settings give you a chance to be creative with your pictures with just a few clicks of a button. The ability to change the virtual film speed is also a great option, especially in outdoor settings and capturing people or objects in motion. Color depth, focal range and depth of field are all great with the Dimage S414. 

Overall, this is a powerful camera with plenty of room for amateurs and professionals alike. I highly recommend it.
