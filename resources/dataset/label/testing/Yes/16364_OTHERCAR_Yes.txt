            Through the kindness of a friend in a high place, I have been able to borrow many types of computer hardware including several digital cameras.  The HP C200/C200xi is an excellent camera when comparing price and quality.  It's easy to set up, provides great resolution pictures, and unlike some other digital cameras I have used, it's not a battery eater.  You'll get many hours of use out of this one before its time to refresh the batteries.  When transfering pictures to a PC, its fast, reliable, and error free.  Some of the other cameras I have used are difficult to set up and take a lot to tweaking to get them to work.  The HP C200/C200xi is simple and fast.  Overall, when looking at quality, price, and ease of use, this is an excellent choice.<br><br>
