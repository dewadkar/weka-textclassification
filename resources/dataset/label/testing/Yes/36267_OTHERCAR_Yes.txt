            Just the name Toyota should be enough...I have always owned Toyotas.  They seem to be extremely dependable with very little maintenance. I recently leased a Toyota Corolla.

 I have a 4 year old daughter and when considering which car to lease, one of my concerns was , of course safety. This car not only has the usual air bags in front but also on the sides of both the driver and passenger seats.

 The engine in this car is terrific For a 4 cylinder it has quite kick to it. The only thing I do wish is that it had a little more room in the back area. When my daughter is riding with me in her car seat it seems she can't help but hit the back of my seat with her feet. Another thing is I would have liked to put her car seat in the middle, to protect her better but it doesn't seem to sit properly.

 Overall this is a great car for the price. If you are looking for reliability this is the car for you.<br><br>
