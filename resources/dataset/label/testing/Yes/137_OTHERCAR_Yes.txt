            I have doubted many other digital cameras in the past but this camera I have to say can get the job done. I have used it at parties, for ebay and yahoo auctions. So far I can say the pictures come out clean and crisp.  The flash works well in complete darkness too.  I would have favored a larger smartmedia card because the 4MB they give you just isn't enough when you're on the run.  And the batteries died out on me quick, I tried w/o out using the LCD screen, but the viewfinder is just too small.

Overall I would recommend this camera to any person looking for something decent and just to say they have a digital camera that works, but for high end applications you might want to look for the new Sony MVC. <br><br>
