            I bought this car as a used car in 1996. It was my first car and I was excited. I never thought it would last as long as it did. When I bought it it had 114,000 miles on it, to this day it has 215,000 miles and is still running strong. Nothing is wrong with it. The only problem I had with the car was the radiator. I had to put two brand new radiators in it. Driving this vehicle is almost like driving a nice sports car. I would suggest this car to any college or high school student. It doesn't give a lot of problems and it does not drink a lot of gas. It is the best car for students. Anyone who wants a reliable car should buy it, but unfortunately I don't think Pontiac makes the car anymore so buying a brand new one is out of the question. I gave the car to my aunt and uncle a month ago because I bought another used car and yes it is another Pontiac. It is a 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix. I love this car too.<br><br>
