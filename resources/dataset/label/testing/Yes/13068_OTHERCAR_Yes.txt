            I recently purchased my third Isuzu Trooper, a new 2000 model.  Previously I have owned a 91 and a 93 Trooper.  Obviously, I think they're great vehicles.

I live in the west where I get lots of opportunity to beat up vehicles.  I've taken my Troopers places that I didn't really believe I could get to.  They've never failed me yet.  I've never seen a tougher, more durable vehicle.

My new 2000 trooper is great.  It has A LOT more power than the 93 model (one of the few shortcomings of the older models) and feels a lot smoother and quieter.

So far, I've only got 3,000 miles on the new Trooper, and I haven't had a chance yet to really test it's toughness, but I'm looking forward to a lot of years of rugged service.

By the way, one of the reasons that I purchased a new Trooper (I still have the 93 model) is the great rebates that my dealer was offering.  I was able to buy my new car, complete with seat heaters, 6 disc CD, trailer hitch, and a few other doodads for less than $23k.
