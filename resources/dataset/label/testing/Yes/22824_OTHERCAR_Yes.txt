            I recently bought this particular model of car, the 2003 Oldsmobile Alero, in September of 2002. I went to Florida in march of this year, and rented this particular car, the 2002 model, from Alamo. I drove it while I was there, and fell in love with the car.

I test drove the 2002 Alero model before the 2003 model came out. I wanted the newer model (2003) because I liked the design better than the previous model. The setup on the dash, is much more user friendly and more trendy than other cars I have owned previously.

I paid $26,500 CAD ($17,150 USD) for the car, getting A/C, power-locks, windows and key-less remote entry. I got a 2 door, GX Coupe, black leather seats, (option package B), with CD player, 6 speaker surround sound, and tinted windows. The car came with a 60,000 Mile/ 3 year power train warranty. I purchased an extended warranty of 2 years, for an extra $1000 CAD.

Since I have owned the car, I have had no problems. I have noticed that the trunk space is smaller than previous models, but the back seat has more leg room.

This car, with 4 doors, although not the typical family car, would make an excellent choice. The gas mileage, is very good, although it has a 2.2L engine.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this car to everyone!

<b>Update #1:</b>

Since this was one of the first reviews I wrote, I left out some helpful ideas that might be useful to the readers of this review.

I find this car has a very sporty look, and yet, I admitted it was a good family car, it has it's own sleek style, that will turn a few heads. I have a 4 year old daughter, and she keep saying, "Daddy has a cool car", so, that almost speaks for itself.

I have found that handling to be very trustworthy. The other day, I had to swerve out of the way of another driver, who decided to take a turn, extremely slow and only left me half a lane to go by. I was able to quickly manuever around the car, and continue on.

Since I am a guy, I love the feeling of acceleration. You know, zoom zoom. Well this car, although it has a V-6 3.4 Liter engine, the fuel economy is pretty average and it still gives you the feeling as if you were driving something like a Mustang.
