            I just happened to be thinking about getting a new car, and I happened along a red Saturn sitting along the side of the road, and I just knew I had to have it.  Now, it sits in my driveway, and I wait to run outside yelling and screaming at any bird who cames near it.

For you see, the only bad part about this car is that the birds seem to love it more than I do.  While visiting my sister's house- where she parks her 1998 Midnight Blue Saturn, and her boyfriend parks his 1968 Purple Camaro- even for the shortest period of time, my car always gets hit by the birds, while theirs remain clean.  But, if nothing else, it gives me the satisfaction of knowing my car is better liked than both of theirs, as well as the satisfaction of having a clean car every week, because I can't stand to see such a blemish on an otherwise near-perfect car.

And when I say near-perfect, I mean it does everything and more.  It is the <i>ideal</i> car, which many other makers should look up to.  It is un-real how much slander is out there about this company.  When people heard I was looking at a Saturn, I heard it all: comments about the plastic panelling, guys with egos telling me it wasn't even worth the time for me to try and race them (though I didn't plan on trying), and people with no experience sitting in one complaining about the seating area.  All this coupled with the rude looks when people found out what I was getting really made me wonder how such a well-organized company earned such a reputation.

How could anyone despise a car where you can have full control of everything that goes on in the car while barely moving your body from the driver's seat, and also the comforting feeling that you will be safe while doing it (if the driver is a safe one to begin with).  And, if children are a concern, the rear doors are equipped with safety locks which can be activated before the trip begins, and the rear windows have an option which allows you to disable the rear controls, locking the height at whatever height you choose.  Nothing can be reached from the rear seats, so a safely belted youngster is nothing to be concerned with.  And adult passengers can ride in safety and comfort in all of the seats, no matter their size.  Everything adjusts to the preference of the passenger, without compromising another (unless, of course, the constant complaints when tall persons are seated behind one another).

The engine and all of the running parts of the car are reliable in any weather, and it is all set up to the point that, if I were any less brighter, I would be confident that I could drive it undersea without any difficulty.  But, of course, these are not the days of Speed Racer and his Mach V, though I am confident that me and my Saturn could take him any day...
