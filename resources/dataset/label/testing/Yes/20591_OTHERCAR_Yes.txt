            Why the Audi A4?

I wanted a smaller 4-door car or a larger 2-door car.  My new car was going to be my first, and I knew it would have be around for the long haul; 5 to 7 years.  With these two parameters in mind I also tried to find cars that were stylish, easy to modify, had relatively low insurance rates, and some get up and go under the hood.   After about 3 months of research (actually about 5 years�I love cars and have always played the �if you could own any car in the world� game with many of my good friends) and several test drives, I decided to go for an A4.  

What do I think of my A4?

I would be lying if I didn�t say I loved it. Here are the major uppers:
- The little things!  From a first aid kit to the hazard triangle Audi thought about it all.  I could go on about this forever, but let me just sum it up:  I give everyone the dime tour of the gadgets in my car�and everyone loves them!
- The red dash.  I think they are easier to read and just plain cool.
- The manual transmission.  Easy to master, and even more fun to push to its edge.
- The finish and looks.  Go see one in person.  Tell me I am wrong.

 I would also be lying if I didn�t say I have a few problems with it.  Many of the little things I plan to fix, but there are some big ones that I can do nothing about.   The major downers are:
- VERY limited room in the back!!! Don�t try to fit 4 average to big guys in this car for a long haul�they will hate you.
- With the Sun Roof open and at the right speed (about 40mph) a repetitive thumping noise is generated from the wind
- The brakes generate a lot of brake dust that makes the wheels look very dirty very fast.  

Closing thoughts:

I would buy this car again.  No questions.  Just know the limitations of this car and your goals for it.  Look for more in the future.
