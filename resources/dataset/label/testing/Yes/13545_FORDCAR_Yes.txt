            We bought the Ford Explorer because it had more room than the Mazda Protege we used to own. I absolutely love my truck. My husband and I bought it with all wheel drive all the time. I like the way it rides, it feels like we're riding on a pillow. The only complaint I have about it is that it guzzles gas, but that's because in order to get the all wheel all time you had to buy the V8. The V8 has awesome pick up-its the 5.0 engine that used to be put into a Mustang. It's a lot of fun to drive. The people who want to buy it is someone looking for a bigger vehicle. It may be a little more expensive than some other Sport Utility Vehicle's, and that might make a person not want to buy it.<br><br>
