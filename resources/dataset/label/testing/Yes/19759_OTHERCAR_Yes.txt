            Well, definitely first thing which go when you get married is a luxury :). I had 1999 Acura 3.2 TL which I sold after start thinking about having a family (read bad for car seats and mess which come along with the babies - btw we are expecting first one :)).

After looking a number of cars on the market, and evaluating my options (budget), this 1998 Mazda 626 LX V6 came as a winner. I already owned 1997 V4 Mazda 626 DX and I kind of knew what to expect from the car. For about $7500 US - around $12000 CAN with taxes, I bought the car in February 2002. 

Well let's start....

Performance - Engine:

Mazda 626 V6 engine is a very nice performer. Acceleration is nice, and engine is relatively quiet. Engine is still nice at 75K miles (115K KM). No problems on that side

Transmission:

Well, I had a major problem with my 1997 Mazda 626. At about 15K miles (25K KM), my transmission died. I was on the business trip and about 400 miles away from home when tranny go nuts. Second and forth gear died and I needed to drive back home for the repair. Imagine going 45 miles per hour on the highway for a 400 miles. Quite a experience. New Mazda, well lately I hear some noise from the trany on this car too, and I hope that it will not be big problem, because is out of the warranty now. Let's see what will happen there

Interior:

Very nice, roomy. Seats are comfortable for big guys. I am 5'11 and around 300 lbs. CD/Speakers are also good quality

Fuel Consumption - Average speed of 75 miles (120 KM):

City: 20 miles per gallon (12L per 100 KM)
Highway: 23.5 miles per gallon (10L per 100)

I would recommend this car for anyone on the budget.
