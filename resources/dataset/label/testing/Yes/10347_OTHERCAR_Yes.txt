            It Is Hard to Change a Winner

Toyota Corolla CE, 2001

When you have a winner it is hard to make change. So for the 2001 Corolla model Toyota did very minor changes.

To see any changes you have to look first at the front of the automobile, newly designed headlights chrome trimmed for the grill and a lower bumper is new. For the rear the 2001 model received a new set of taillights and that is it for this year.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

For the new millennium Toyota has eliminated the VE base model and replaced with a new trim, the CE which has more base equipment than its predecessor does.

The CE is the trim I selected to test drive and I will focus more on it than other trim in the Corolla line up. The other model available under the Corolla banner is the LE, it is the sportier looking one and it comes with cool stuff like body skirts, rear spoiler, tachometer, fog lamps and alloy wheels.

For the same price you would have paid a VE trim in 2000, with the CE you will get as base equipment an AM/FM cassette radio with a CD changer.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The inside of the Corolla CE I drove was fairly basic, it is a loaner that the dealership offer its customers when their cars has to stay in the shop for a few days.  Nevertheless, I did like the space available for the front of the cabin, but for the rear seat space especially legroom was at a premium.

Once in the driver seat you will have an excellent all around view, I did not like too much the smaller side view mirrors but since the Corolla is not a very long vehicle did will do anyway.

Behind the steering wheel all the gauges are easy to see and all the controls are easy to see and reach.  

As I mentioned the car I drove was very basic, it only had the standard AM/FM cassette radio with CD changer and the rear window defroster. I do not understand what Toyota really means when they say in their literature that the new CE trim comes with more basic features the 2000 VE.

The CE I test-drove also had optional air conditioning which when it was turned on it greatly affected the performance of the engine.      

The exterior:

I did like the lines of the Corolla all the panels fit tightly and the design is excellent.

In the trunk you will have 12.1 cubic feet of volume to transport your groceries.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Toyota Corolla I test drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 1.8 liters, 4-cylinder engine that develops 125 horsepower at 5600 RPM&gt;
Transmission: An optional 4-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: Front discs and rear drums.
Tires: 175/65R14
Safety: Dual front airbags.
            Child safety locks.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I was disappointed with the Corolla I test drove, I thought that it should have more basic safety equipment such as ABS brakes and keyless remote entry.

Nevertheless I will still recommend it since the car can be up graded with options.
