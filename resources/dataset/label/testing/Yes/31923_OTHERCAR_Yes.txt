             After looking at and test driving the 2000 Honda CRV and the 2000 Toyota RAV4, I opted for the 2001 Subaru Forester S and coudn't be happier with my purchase. I've owned this
vehicle for about 8 months now and I still can't wait to
get behind the wheel each day. The AWD is seamless, no
flipping of levers or pushing of buttons, just get in and
go... the Forester takes care of the rest. It works extremely well on wet roads, even better on dry pavement, and after the New Years snowstorm here in the northeast, I couln't wait to test it out. As expected, it works great.
The winter weather package(heated seats, side mirrors and
windshield wipers) is a must, and all work to perfection.
    My drive to work is 80 miles round trip, so a good stereo is a must. Although the 6 disc in-dash changer is
great, but the factory speakers suck. I upgraded the system with MB Quart component speakers(separate mid-range drivers and tweeters with crossover) in the front doors. They fit nicely into the factory openings. For the rear door speakers I used MB Quart coaxials to round out the sound. I put a 100 watt X 4 amplifier under the fron passenger seat and then installed a Bazooka Bass Tube in the rear cargo area. The bass tube easily unplugs if I need the space. Needless to say this system ROCKS.
    The only other complaint I have is on the cup holders.
they're flimsy and not located in a good place.. right in front of the radio and air ducts.
    All in all the Forester is a GREAT buy for the money, I
would recommend it highly.
