            I really hate to write anything negative about this camera. I really enjoy using it, it is simple to use, and it does take very good pictures in almost all light conditions. However, there are some negative aspects that I think any prospective purchaser should understand.

First of all, let me emphasize that this camera was a Christmas gift from my in-laws. I had minimal previous experience with digital cameras, and to be quite honest, I'm not much of a picture taker to begin with. In that light, please take my comments with a grain of salt, particularly if you're an avid photographer. 

The D-490 has many good qualities. It gives me several picture quality options, which is nice when I just want to send someone a picture over email. I don't have to be sending multiple-MB files and clogging up my dialup connection. It also has a viewfinder like a standard 35mm camera. This is very nice because I can put the camera right up to my face and look through it just as I always have. This also saves on battery power, because I only have to have the little screen on if I want to change options, or if I want to review the pictures I've already taken. 

Other things I like about the camera are the media (the wafer-thin disk that holds 16MB of pictures is GREAT!), the small size, and the similarity to other Olympus cameras. My wife has an Olympus 35mm that she got a few years ago, and just having taken a few pictures with it, I had almost an instinctive knowledge of where to look for some gadgets on the new digital.

However, there are some problems I have with the camera. The placement of the viewfinder with respect to the screen is inconvenient. I don't know which to recommend to Olympus to move, but every time I look through the viewfinder to take a picture, I get a nice little smudge on the screen from the tip of my nose, as the screen is located directly below the viewfinder. Over time, this pretty severely degrades the image on the screen until I get around to cleaning it. 

Other, minor issues I have with the camera are the fact that the flash is manual, and that the viewfinder doesn't seem to quite line up with what the camera is actually filming. I call these both minor issues, and I will explain. The flash issue isn't too bad for two reasons. First, the camera takes VERY good pictures even without the flash, and second, the few times you would need a flash are probably very dark situations, and you shortly get into the habit of flipping up the flash when needed. Similarly, the viewfinder alignment is a quickly formed habit of just aiming the camera a bit (I'm talking inches here) lower than it looks like you'd have to through the viewfinder. Voila, the picture you thought you were getting :)

I'll admit my lack of experience here and tell you, gentle reader, that I have not experimented with all of this camera's features, so please read nothing into this opinion that I haven't specifically addressed. In particular, I haven't used the movie feature, so I have no idea how well it works. 

Okay. I hope I've provided some useful information to someone. Good luck out there!
