            I've upgraded my digital camera from an Olympus D360L to the Fuji Finepix 2650.  Originally I wanted the 2600 model because it uses the Smart media memory card and my Olympus uses that too.  That way I don't have to buy different memory card.  However, the 2650 model uses the x-D picture card developed by Fuji and Olympus.  So I guess this would be compatible with any of those 2 brands that will use the x-D picture card.  In one sense, the x-D picture uses less power and writes faster.  Also in the future the x-D picture card can hold up to 1 Gigabytes of data.  Most card are now around 128 megabytes.  That's like 8 of these 128 megabytes cards for storage.

Externally, the 2650 is very light with batteries.  Even with batteries, it pretty lightweight; compared to my Olympus which uses 4 batteries.  The 2650 uses only 2 batteries.  If you don't use the LCD, you can take pictures all day if viewing thru the viewfinder.  I always use rechargeable NiMH batteries.  They would last for about 1 1/2 if left on constant.  So if you use the LCD, take pictures, turn off and turn on to take pictures, it could last hours and hours.

The good thing about this camera is the built in len cover to protect your lens.  The only thing I don't like about this is that you have to expose the lens and power on in order to view your pictures.  Unlike the Olympus, you can just leave the lens cover in place and just power on.  More wear and tear on the lens popping in and on everytime you power on and off.

The other good thing is when you take a picture, there's a light indicator that turns green to let you know when you can take another picture.  On the Olympus, you had to look at the top of the camera and make sure the "writing" symbol disappear.

Navigating thru the mode is easy.  It's a dial up button.  One setting is for taking pictues, one for reviewing pictures and one for the movie mode.

The buttons near the LCD is to navigate thru the menus such as setting the date/time, picture resolution, beeping on/off, macro mode, etc.  It also serve as the yes/no button for your selection.  

The buttons near the dial up button on the upper right is the zoom button and left/right buttons for navigation.

It's pretty easy to use.  Point and shoot.

For excellent 5x7 prints, you should choose the 2M Fine mode.

For excellent 4x6 prints, you can choose the 2M Normal mode.

On a 64M card, you can shoot around 159 pictures on the 2M Normal mode or 100 pictures on the 2M Fine mode.  I prefer the 2M Normal mode because I get excellent 4x6 prints or on a 17" monitor, it would fill it up.  Also on the 2M Normal mode, the jpeg picture size is about 300K as opposed to the 2M Fine's 500K.  Also on the 2M Normal mode, you wait about 1 second before you can take another picture as opposed to the 2M Fine mode 3 or so seconds.  It depends what you want.

The 2650 also comes with a 3x optical zoom.  Digital zoom only crops the picture and will lose resolution while optical zoom uses the lens to bring objects closer.

There's no connection to connect to a TV to view your pictures which the Olympus have.

The flash is a little slow but I think most camera flash is slow.

Downloading your pictures to your PC is easy.  Just connect the USB cable to the camera and turn it on basically.  The supplied software is pretty good.  The Finepix viewer software gives you thumbnails snapshots.  The Photoimpression software is great.  I use this to print.  You can make greeting cards, calendars or various sizes and configuration of your photos.  Also included is a software to make a VCD photo album.  Unfortunately it didn't support my CD burner.

So for $199 for a 2 Megapixel camera, it's a bargain.
