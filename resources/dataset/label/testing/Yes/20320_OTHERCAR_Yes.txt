            I own a 95 corolla and I am very pleased with how it has held up over the years. It is a decent looking, safe, dependable car. It was also relatively inexpensive. The corolla has airbags, a pretty good stereo, automatic transmition, and power windows. All of these features are great to have. The corolla doesn't give you anything you dont need. It is a good family car because of its durability and because it seats 5 people. Since I have owned my corolla I have not had any major problems with the car and it has started up everytime i have turned the key. This includes cold temperatures in new england, as well as blazing hot summer days. Speaking of cold and hot, the corolla has air conditioning and heat. One great thing about the corolla is it gets great gas mileage. This will save you a lot of money in the long run. The car has good handling, and a decent acceleration. One negative is that the heat and air conditioning in the corolla take a little while to start working. All in all the corolla is a great car and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. One last negative for the corolla, there isnt that much room. The back seats can be crowded for adults.<br><br>
