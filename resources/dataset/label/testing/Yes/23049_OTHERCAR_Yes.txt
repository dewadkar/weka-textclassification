            The Polaroid PDC640 digital camera is amazingly simple to operate.  Just open the window, hit a button, and preview it on the small screen.  This digital camera also has lots of storage space and offers extremely clear images with editing options.  The images are of great size and clear and bright in .jpg format.  This camera has better quality and bette photo taknig abilities than cameras $100-$300 more in price than it.  This is deffinately the best under $200 digital camera out there, leagues above the &quot;Jam Cam&quot;.  I bought my Polaroid PDC 640 at the local Wal Mart Supercenter at under $200.  The PDC links up to the computer so no disk is needed.<br><br>
