            The Kodak DC-210 is the perfect combination of extras and ease.  The viewing window allows you to delete pictures after viewing them with ease.  You can view the photo you have just taken, delete it and take a new one in less than 1 minute, allowing you to free memory space and get a second picture before you lose the opportunity.  This feature also allows you to take multiple pictures of the same scene and review them when the action has ended.  You can then delete the ones you do not want, save the ones you do and continue taking pictures.  The viewing screen can also be on to set up the shot but this will drastically reduce your battery time. 

The zoom feature is limited to 2x and may not be sufficient if you wish to take pictures from a great distance.  

The flash has an easy button to change between flash when needed indoor or outdoor, no flash and always flash.  

The status screen is easy to read and very informative with the number of pictures remaining, battery status and the quality level you have chosen.  

Downloading your pictures to your computer can be tricky at first but once you have your computer set up it is really quite simple.  Unlike many digital cameras this camera does not require you buy any additional equipment or software to download the pictures.  

The resolution can be as high as 1152 X 864 pixels giving you great editing and printing.<br><br>
