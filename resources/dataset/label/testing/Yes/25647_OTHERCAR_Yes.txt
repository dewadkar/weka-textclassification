            Saab has a reputation for quirkiness and being a car for those who like to drive. Even though now owned by GM, Saab retains that sportiness and sparkiness that makes it a great car for car enthusiasts to drive.

With its Saab trademark key on the center transmission console to its &quot;beautiful&quot; retracting cup holder and supple seats and spirited engine, the Saab 9-5 is a wonderful car to drive.

Having formerly owned a Saab 9000, 5-speed stick shift, the only thing we miss is the extremely useful and versatile hatch back design. However, Saab has now provided a station wagon to its line up so those who want more space, can be happy.

Compared to our former 9000 however, the quality of the 9-5 is greatly superior in every way. And it is as much fun to drive!
