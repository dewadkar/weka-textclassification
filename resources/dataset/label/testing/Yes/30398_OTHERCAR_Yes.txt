            I love my Aztek! It has plenty of power and its ready for anything you can throw at it.  One complaint I have of the Aztek is the darn radio button, it seems like such a small thing to dwell on but, its something you use every day and often. When you are trying to adjust the volume nearly everytime it never fails, you turn off the radio. Since, to turn the radio off you just push the volume button in, and this control is very touchy. 

 I would give the rear seat comfort a zero, the seat is so low to the ground and is rock hard. However, there is plenty of legroom in the back. I love the front seats, i wish we had opted for rear captains chairs.
 
 We have not had one problem out of this vehicle and it now has 24,000 miles on it, reliability seems to be good. Our last car, a 1998 Chevrolet Blazer spent more time in the shop than it did in our driveway, it had 2 new engines. As you can imagine we are happy that we got that off of our shoulders. 

And, the little computer like screen on the console tells us when we need to change the oil. And, this is not based on milage it is based on the condition of the oil. 

The interior reminds me of a cockpit, with sharp lines and grips everywhere.

I love my car and would recomend it for everyone, the only thing I think I would add is the 1,000 dollar Pioneer stereo system which has diferent controls, it is really worth it.
An ours was a steal at only 16,500 for a new car that had only 8,000 miles on it.
