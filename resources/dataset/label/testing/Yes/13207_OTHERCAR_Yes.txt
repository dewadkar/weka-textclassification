            When you power the camera up, it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it's ready to shoot. Once it's ready, you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully. Now you have a pic! You can review it on the LCD if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds. The LCD screen measures 1.5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness.
Next move inside to take some flash pictures. Here you'll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light. There's a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash, when you focus, it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus. This eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all. Also inside, you'll appreciate the fact that Canon put a decent flash on this little guy. It has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting.
Picture Quality is very good. Pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones. I do get red-eye sometimes in indoor shots but, not always and, not to the point that I would consider unacceptable. 

Software, etc.

Canon supplies you with two software applications. One their own and the other is ArcSoft's. Both applications are good for basic image editing but, if you want something more you'll likely use Photoshop.
Downloading photo's is pretty straight forward once the software is installed. Hook up the computer with the supplied cable to a USB port, flip the mode switch, turn it on, and your computer (PC) will either open the appropriate program or, you'll have to. Once the program is open, pick the images you want and, hit File, Transfer. That's about it. You can also view images, and movies on a TV with the supplied cable.
The only other things in the box (aside from the manual) are a 16MB Compact Flash card and, 4 AA batteries. In the highest resolution, you'll get 8 pictures on this card so, you'll probably want to also purchase a 12x 256mb Lexar online for $50. The 4AA batteries will last about 100 pics so, consider purchasing $30 Rayovac 15min rechargeables also. The batteries and the CF card will set you back about another $80 but, you'll thank yourself later. I would recommend these for anyone purchasing a digital camera.
