            Dear Readers,
  In '94 I purchased a Jeep Cherokee Sport.  I thought it was a decent price for a sport utility vehicle, since it was $3,000 dollars less than an comparable vehicle in its class.  

Since buying this vehicle new I thought it would be trouble free.  I picked it up and 2 days later had it back to the dealership to have a leaky steering dampener and tire fixed.  They fixed the dampener and informed me the tire had no leak.  Funny I had to fill it up about every three days.  Maybe that tire just needed more fresh air than the others? 

The only other repair other than regular maintenance to this vehicle up to this point of about 40,000 is we had to replace the shocks.  A little soon I think.

Most of the driving my wife and I have put on it is highway mileage and have had it for six years and have just less than 60,000 miles we have only had one more problem with it.  It seems the metal in the door jamb (drivers side) gets weak after a certain period of time.  Either it was no thick enough or was of lower quality.  My wife failed to take it to the dealership not wanting to deal with the hassle of that so she had it welded to repair it.

Other than the stated problems above we have been pleased with this vehicle.  I will, once returning to the states let the dealership know the door situation so I can see if there was a recall or if this was a fluke.
