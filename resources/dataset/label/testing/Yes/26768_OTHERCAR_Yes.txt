                 So you think you want to buy a Jeep.  I mean come on they're everywhere, movies, rap songs have been written about them, and even the police are using them instead of their usual cruisers.  I know they have tremendous cub appeal, but what really goes through the mind of a Cherokee owner after the initial joy of owning a sport utility vehicle has worn off?

     I must admit I too was swayed by the &quot;cool factor&quot; of owning my very own jeep.  I could do anything if I just had a sport utility, and a Cherokee is among the founding fathers in the field.  It is a nice looking vehicle and offers some pretty nice options for the interior too.  Mine happens to come with a extra over head compartments and a built in thermometer (both Fahrenheit and Celsius)and compass which come in handy while trying to find my way around the sprawling downtown Tampa area.  I also have a CD player and power locks and windows, which if you have a four door car I have found is less of an option and more of a necessity.

     In a Cherokee four can fit comfortably, and cargo room is abundant.  The trunk is also a great place to stick your friends when they've had a little too much to drink and are getting a little on the annoying side.  The V6 seems to have adequate power and can accelerate pretty quickly from a stop.

     Had there not been the recent gas price explosion, I might have enjoyed riding around in my Jeep Cherokee Sport a little more.  However, with a 20 gallon tank, 15 miles to the gallon and gas costing at least a buck fifty (for the cheapy stuff), I'm finding everyday more of a challenge to enjoy my jeep as much.  The Cherokees are also a little on the noisy side.  They're fine while tooling around the city streets, or around some mud pits, but get out on the highway and over 60 and you'll have a harder time hearing those factory 5 and 1/2 speakers.

     Being that I live in Florida, I really haven't had the chance to try out my jeep on any sort of non-paved terrain, although speed bumps are no challenge for me, in fact I refuse to slow down for them anymore.  Over all though it has been an incredibly dependable ride to get me around town, and I love the look people give me when I tell them I drive a Jeep.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with the money flow to afford the gas, and who isn't spooked by a rough ride.  Much like the rides at Disney though, if you have a weak heart, back problems, or are prone to motion sickness, be warned, this ride may not be for you.
