            This isn't your typical review of the Toyota Sienna. I bought the van in August 2000. Shiny and new. My girls (ages 4 and 7) nicknamed her "Sparkle." 

All was well until this past Friday (not the 13th but sure as heck felt like it). As the statistics go, I was rear-ended by a teenage driver just a few blocks from my house on a rainy morning. I guess the teenager just didn't realize that there was a huge line of stop-and-go slow-moving traffic ahead of him (HELLO!!) I think had the misfortune of being the last in line. Then, WHAM (sound of glass shattering). And WHAM again. (An SUV rear-ended him, too).

Screaming frightened kids, back already starting ache. I turned around, expecting to see shattered glass and ugly wreckage but....nothing!

After making sure my kids were alright, I got out of the van, expecting to see a gnarled bumper and shattered tail lights. But...just a minor dent, lights not even touched. And let me tell you, this guy really plowed into me. Both his front airbags deployed, his front windshield was smashed, and his car needed to be towed! He was driving a Volvo, can you believe it! I drove my van away (to the hospital, then to the drug store for ice packs, then home). I was in bed on ice packs and loaded with Ibuprofin for the entire weekend. Fortunately, it seems so far that I'll be ok. Time will tell. Still pretty stiff. The kids are fine, thank God. Good thing I'm a stickler for proper car seats and auto safety! Good thing also that my kids were in the middle row, lessening their impact.

Today I got my car inspected by the auto shop approved by the insurance company. No structural damage to my car. But replacing the bumper will run $800 including labor. I assume that I will not have to pay for this. I'd like my van to look shiny and new again. After all, as of today, it is only six months old!

I come away from this experience in awe of my minivan. Those bumpers are fantastic. They live up to their advertisement. I feel very safe in my Sienna. 

I only have one peeve about my van. The automatic door can be deployed WAY too easily from the remote. I wish Toyota had recessed this button further into the remote, making it harder to engage. I must be very careful when handling the remote, so I don't accidently open or close the auto door.

Now if my back and left shoulder will stop aching, I can play my Stratocaster again (I MISS PLAYING MY GUITAR!) I'll have to scrounge around my house for that other "Fender" bumpersticker to put on my bumper after it is fixed. Long live rock, and rolling along in my Toyota Sienna!
