            I've recently purchased Toyota Camry 2000 model.  I was skeptical about buying foreign car at first, but everyone I knew told me that I'd feel different about Camry.  What do I think about Camry?  I LOVE IT!!!!
I love my car, it's quiet and smooth.  Power needs more work, but it is still very good.  When you turn on the engine, you barely noticed that the engine's on.  That's how quiet this car is.  

If I have to point out few bad things about Camry, it is its blind spot, and its power seat.  Camry's driver's side headrest is located too close to the window which blocks your blind spot.  It took me two months to get used it.  I guess if you over use power seat, it's bound to cause a problem; it took my camry 3 months before it started to make weird noises. 

If you want a smooth drive and dependability, rather than power, Camry's the car for you.
