            We were getting ready to replace our Lumina in the summer of 1998.  Unfortunately GM was on strike at the time and LUMINAS were not to be had.  My husband had purchased a used Saturn from a Saturn Dealership and really liked it.  SO he said, &quot;Honey, let's get a second one.&quot; 

The dealership, our salesman and the ordering process were superb.  They were hospitable, offered us a soda--got popcorn for our son.  Everything was organized and professional and NO last minute surprises.  I was so surprised when we came to pick up the car and here it was in the front window with a big RED BOW on the top of my 1999 Blue Saturn SL!  Boy did I feel special.  Then they gave us each a rose and took a picture of us with our new car.  I felt like I had one the Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes!  

Well we have now had the car a year.  We have had NO service problems, get good mileage (28 on the road, 20 in the city).  It has 22,000 miles on it and just buzzes along, as doesn't it's garage partner the 95 Saturn which has 100,000 miles on it.  The only major repair on the 95 has been the muffler and the alternator--haven't even replaced the BRAKES.  

My only complaint is the car is just a little too small for 4 people on a vacation.  But how often do you go on vacation anyway??  If you are looking for a dependable car, Saturn is a Good bet!<br><br>
