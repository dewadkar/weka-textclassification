            My experiance with the Sony Mavica CD500 has been a very good one. The camera takes beautiful pictures that load on to your computer simply and easily. The camera is light, has a very professional look and features that would turn on anybody.

I bought this certain camera because it is the top of the line version of the Sony Mavica series. The Sony Mavica series is a group of cameras that take digital pictures and instead of recording the photo onto a memory stick it stores it on a Floppy Disk or 3 inch CD. This camera, the CD500 records the memory to a 3 inch CD. I needed this technology and I will be leaving the country for an extended amount of time without a computer. The sony site (www.sonystyle.com) lists this as one of the prime reasons to buy this camera, and I have found it to work very well for this reason.

The CD500 has very large (2.5 inch) and very beautiful LCD view screen. The screen has a special light for ilumination which can be shut off to save energy.

The CD500 has a 3x zoom on a Carl Zeiss Lens. This is the perfect amount of zoom for most non-pro users of the camera. When using the Macro button on the camera you can enhance and zoom in on close objects or distant objects.

The CD500 can take MPEG Movies, Pictures with sound, 3 burst pictures (for moving targets) and TIFF photographs.

The CD500 has instant review and deletion options and lets you review all the pictures on that disc and their settings.

The CD500 can link to you computer via USB and comes with software to capture and edit the photos you take.

The CD500 can take pictures in 5mp, 4mp, 3mp, 1.2mp and VGA modes and can add the option of Email sizing (perfect for emailing pictures).

The CD500 has anti-red eye and depth perception abilities for the auto exposure option.

I do not know that much about Manual exposure photography but this camera is capable of doing it and my friend who does know how to use these functions was able to pick up the camera and master them in a VERY short amount of time.

I have loved having this camera because it takes great pictures and it can transfer to my computer very quickly. I have loved every second of owning this camera.

The CD500 is very delicate, the LCD can be scratched and smudged easily and the lenses are delicate.
