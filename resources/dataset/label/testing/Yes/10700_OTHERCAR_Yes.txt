            I recently purchased the Fuji Film FinePix 6900 Zoom camera and have had nothing but success in picture taking.  The various options in file size and quality all produce crisp, quality, printable images.  The 6x optical zoom is one of the highest optical zooms I have witnessed on consumer digital cameras without going professional.  The dual zoom controls are easy to use and the rotating image mode selector makes selecting modes quick.  The shutter speeds are nice to experiment with, though you are limited to 1/1000th of a second up to 3 seconds.  The preset modes such as night, landscape, etc also do a good job without having to mess with the setting manually.  The 2 time delayed shots (2 sec and 10 sec) make up for the lack of a shutter wire support.  The bright lcd screen also is clear and useful, however the viewfinder is just a scaled down version through an eyepiece.  The built in flash is bright enough for most common distances, and there is an external flash capability.  While the video clip shooting is nice, it lacks a microphone for sound- something other finepix models have.  The USB transfer rate is adequate with the smart media cards, but a card reader is faster.  All menus and options are fairly easy to use with a little experience behind you.  Battery life pretty good.....it will last you a decent amount of time without recharging for a high-end camera.  Also available are adapters to ad certain filters and lens to the camera.  I recommend purchasing a tripod if you do not have one.....it comes in handy.  The price is a little up there.....if you shop around you can get some deals- less than the 1000 recommended price tag.
