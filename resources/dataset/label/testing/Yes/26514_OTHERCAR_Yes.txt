            When I first bought the S-10, I didn't think it would be such a smooth ride for a 4 cylinder.  When I took a long road trip in it though, it was surprisingly comfy too.  It has a nice sound system and a very handy console with lots of storage room.  The back, though, isn't made for adults.  It also handled pretty well on mountain roads. It also looks very sleek and bold, compared to what they looked like a few years ago.  Overall, the truck is very nice for the money, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small truck with room for storage and a comfy ride up-front. <br><br>
