            I picked mine up on ebay about a year ago. Mine is a 1997, Turbo Convertible with only 50K miles. This car is a great vehicle in every sense of the word. The top is one touch, and has a built in cover. The turbo kicks in (not like a Viggen however) nicely. The interior still looks brand new, and is very well appointed.  The sound system is solid, the climate controls are wonderful, and the heated seats are fantastic. 

Comments on some areas of the car: 

Acceleration: Not nose-bleed fast, but can really get up and go. The Turbo engages and you feel a little rush. 

Body integrity: Wow. these things are solid. I've seen few cars built so well. Slam the door, and all you hear is a solid "thud". 

Tires: this is cool. Mine came with OEM "Gslaved" tires. Known as the "Swedish Tyre brand". Hugs road through ice and rain. I'm going to try to buy these for all my cars. 

Paint: Doesn't chip every easily. 

Engine: It's inverted. That's really cool. 

I've noticed these things age gracefully, and I look forward to doing so with it.
