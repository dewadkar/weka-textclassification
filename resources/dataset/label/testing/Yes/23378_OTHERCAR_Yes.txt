            When they decided to start building Sport Utilities, I thought to myself, �what is going on?�  I didn�t think they could do and make it unique, cool, useful, and affordable.  Well, they did.  Let me start by saying that I am not the biggest fan of the styling.  It just looks like a warped station wagon to me.  But some like it.

I drove this thing down to Key West about two years ago.  They had just come out and everybody on the road had no clue what it was.  It felt top heavy to me.  This inside was extremely nice in classic Mercedes style, but nothing to special.  The engine had juice, but not enough to make me scream.  The handling was cool, but not exciting.  Kind of blah.

The reliability is great.  I have never heard of anyone nor myself having any problems with this car (because that�s what it is; a car.)

Now, skip forward two years.  Last weekend I drove the ML55�the fastest stock sport utility on earth.  This thing will get your heart racing.  They have really put some effort into this one.  

There is little roll in the turns and the motor puts out nearly 400 HP.  It will fly.  The inside is much nicer and comes with the command center that will do about anything you ask.  It tells you how for you are away from the proper exit and then show graphically to the foot how close you are getting.  It will then tell you which lane to get in and where you can grab a burger.  It is amazing.

The 55 has huge AMG wheels that have to be the fattest tires I have ever seen.  They should belong on a Porsche.  I haven�t had it off-road but I am told that it is incredible.

I am sold on this one�but the price.  WOW!  $68,000.  I really think that before I spend that on a �truck�, I going to take a look at the Range Rovers.

No doubt its fun, but I�m not sure it�s worth it.  Get an E-Class and a used
