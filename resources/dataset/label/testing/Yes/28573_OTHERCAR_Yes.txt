            I was looking for a vehicle that would bring the girls in and be able to do all my hunting and four wheeling. I fond the 2000 jeep wrangler sport. This 4x4 jeep is the best. I love it. It is a sporty looking vehicle but also can handle the rough country. One of the best thing i like about the jeep wrangler is that you can take the soft top off. You can cruise around town show off to the ladies. Then pull of the road and do what men like to do 4 wheel. Their are a few things that are bad about the jeep. The gas mileage is not great and on a long trip its not the best. But if you are looking for a all purpose vehicle. I highly suggest the 2000 jeep wrangler sport<br><br>
