            The BMW M3 is perhaps the most desirable car I have ever driven.  It combines good looks, vault-like build quality, and out-of this world performance in a way no other car available today can quite match. Yes, there are cars which accelerate more quickly, and there are cars which pull higher g-forces on the skidpad.  The magic of the M3 lies in it's ability to combine steering, braking, and acceleration in a completely harmonious way. In a Corvette, for example, you might get down a twisty two-lane a few MPH faster, but you exert yourself manhandling the car.  In the M3, you go just as fast but you can do it while listening to Bach on the CD and drinking a cup of coffee.  The car is so competent, you really have to watch your license. If you drive at the speed at which the car seems comfortable, I guarantee you'll be breaking the speed limit by at least twenty MPH. 
In addition to the powerful 240 Horsepower six-cylinder engine, the cars steering is perhaps the best in the business. Communicative without being harsh, it works with the excellent sport suspension to give you a vivid picture of the cars attitude and the road's surface. I doubt many M3's are victims of spinout crashes, because the car tells you seemingly weeks before it's going to do anything even slightly hairy.  
Like a linebacker wearing ballet slippers, the car also has a gorgeous interior with excellent ergonomics, first rate materials, and a plethora of features.  It has a usable if not downright comfortable rear seat, a generous trunk, a great climate control &amp; sound systems. 
If you want to go fast, be comfortable, and enjoy exclusivity and style, buy the BMW M3.<br><br>
