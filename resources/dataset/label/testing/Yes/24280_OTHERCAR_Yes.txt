            For those unfamiliar with the Grand Cherokee, it's the shapely but expensive sister to the Cherokee.  Of course, it's price is in line with some of it's larger competitors.  The question is, "Is it worth the money?" for this less roomy SUV.  My reply is, "I'm almost as in love with my vehicle as Jeep is it's replacement parts!" In addition to it's attractiveness, the Grand Cherokee generally has ample interior features available, and has more the feel of a car than an SUV. 

I have a Laredo with a dark-green exterior, dark-gray moldings and light gray interior.  This is a sharp combination, but it now seems overly popular.  The '95 Grand Cherokee usually comes with a 4.0L, inline 6, and 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission.  Of course, those with a few extra bucks, say $5-10k more, may have opted for the more powerful V8 in a 4x4 version or upscaled to the Limited with more features.  I don't regret purchasing my Laredo. Both are generally received as quality vehicles and continue to command popularity.  I believe this popularity is not mis-placed... although pre-'97 models are known to have increased maintenance problems.  The AC and transmission are the biggest complaint areas through 1996, but otherwise this is a solid vehicle.  Following are some specifics of my experience:

<i>Purchase Price:</i>
I paid about $9k through a friend in early '99 with about 113k miles.  It now has over 150k.

<i>Price When New:</i>  
Estimated $25-30k

<i>Current Retail:</i>
Blue-book recently listed from $10-$19k.  This is 50% value retained over 6 years.  

<i>Overall Condition:</i>
Both interior and exterior paint are still in very good shape, although the flat black paint on the luggage rack is starting to fade.  The interior is also in good condition, although the carpet is beginning to wear from normal use.  
Tire tread wears evenly, and replacement tires are reasonable.  After fixing the items listed under <i>repairs</i>, I consider this vehicle to be in good shape.  In fact my wife drives it daily.  I notice a low road noise (roar) which may be the rear end, but has been there 2 years.  Still runs well.

<i>Repairs:</i>
1) Horn out when vehicle purchased.  This was bypassed until I can afford the $500-700 the mechanic wanted to work inside the steering column.  It seems he fears deploying the air-bad.  (I probably just need a re-quote)
2) Replaced fuel pump ($500) at 135k.  Don't count this against the vehicle, since I ran low on fuel several times (user abuse).  Word to the wise... keep 1/8 tank of fuel MINIMUM at all times.  One might note the price quoted for the pump was from $350-700 for part and $200 labor.  You may not get the deal I did if you make the same mistake.
3) Replaced oxygen sensor ($40) at 145k.
4) Rebuilt transmission ($800) at 150k.  Again, I guess pulling that Ford tractor may not have been a smart idea. Note: Most quotes were $1,200-$2000.
5) That's it!

Safety:
MSN Carpoint rates this 4 of 5 stars for driver & 3 of 5 stars for passenger.

Fuel Economy:
16-18 city, 21-23 highway 

<i>Detailed Description:</i>
2 wheel drive, 4 door with the standard 4.0L, 190 hp inline 6, 4-speed automatic with Overdrive, PS, PB, PW, PL, PM, AC, Driver Side Airbag, Cruise Control, Interval Wipers, AM/FM Cassette, Tilt Steering, Inside fuel release, Reclining cloth front bucket seats, Center Console, Fold-Down Rear Seat, Tachometer, Digital clock with mileage/trip computations, Map Lights, 235x75R15 Tires, Tinted Glass, Luggage Rack, Rear Window Wiper/Washer/Defroster, etc.


<i>Summary,</i>
The 1995 Grand Cherokee is a definite buy... if the price is right.  This is a solid vehicle.  However, one must realize all vehicles wear over time/miles and this is now a six year old.  When repairs do come, expect to go to the bank!  I would suggest a '97 or newer unless earlier models are discounted at least 10% or comes with a warranty.  Then again, if you had $35 grand, you wouldn't be checking into a '95 would you?  Of course, you can always go buy a Yugo.  <b>NOT!</b>
