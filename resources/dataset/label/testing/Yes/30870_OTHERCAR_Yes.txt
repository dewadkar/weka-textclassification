            I have had a GV 2000 soft top for 6 months, after two Toyota RAV4's. I bought it because the top comes all the way off so it's been great for summer. There is less boot (trunk) space than the RAV but this means more room for the passengers, and the seats are more comfortable. I don't miss the full time 4wheel drive of the RAV as the GV handles great but it's not as nippy or fast as the RAV. The top comes off in two parts which means that you can pull back the first stage and have open air motoring most days out of summer, but taking the whole top down is easy. It's the putting it back on that is a bit of a nuisance and takes a while, so don't get caught in a sudden shower. However it does draw admiring looks on the freeway.
Added August 11th. Since new I have done 6,200 miles and I have logged all the petrol put in. The consumption works out at 32.8 miles per gallon. Mind you I am light on the pedal and easy on the brake and I have not had it off road yet.
