            I am in love with the Jeep Grand Cherokee. My parents bought it in 1993, when I was 13, so I have spent a good deal of time in this car, both as a passenger and driver.  The things that appeal to me about this car are it's height.. I like the feeling of being high up while driving.  The power steering is very smooth and dependable, and the entire car is very roomy and comfortable, making it ideal for long trips with children.  We have had a few problems with the vehicle, mainly with the onboard computer and electronics.. we have a few sensors go a couple times a year, but it is basically an annoyance and nothing more than that.  I hope our family keeps this car until it dies... It is in wonderful condition today at 7 years old and 57,000 miles.<br><br>
