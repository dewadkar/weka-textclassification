            If you've been looking for a reliable, great, and over all affordable car, this is the one you want. The '95 Toyota Camry. After being in several car accidents, I wanted a car that I could feel safe in, would last me awhile, and would be durable in any situation. I asked around, and next to Honda, Camry's came up every time. 

The overall quality of the car is great. I can drive about 300 miles in town on a 15-gallon tank of gas. With the high gas prices, I don't have to fill up as often, and save myself some money. Some other benefits are over/drive, power steering, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, air bags, and an exceleration button. My Camry has a ton of extra features as well. It includes a sunroof that tilts and slides, back seats that fold down to have trunk accessibility, cup holders that slide into the dash, an arm rest with a compartment, power locks with security lock, lock/unlock remote, and a lot more. If I wanted, I could also add an alarm for extra protection. The space is amazing. In the front and back, there's room for every leg size. The seats are also extremely comfortable to sit in. The ride is so quite it's hard to tell if the engine is on or not. The Air conditioning works very well. Being from Texas, I need A/C that will cool the entire car and fast. The Camry does this. 

Toyota's have proven over the years to make excellent cars, and this is one of them. Much like the Honda Accord, but with many differences.
