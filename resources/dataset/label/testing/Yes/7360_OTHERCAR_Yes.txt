             I have recently purchased the 2000 model CL500, on a trade in of a 1999 S500. and i must say there is no comparison of the cars. the sleeker faster body style of the CL500 is so eye catching, people just want to stare. The S500 is a bulky car i will admit, but it is the flagship of
mercedes and one hell of a ride. now that mercedes has beefed up the CL class the S class has a run for it's money. One of the greatest things the mercedes has started using on their vehicles is the G.P.S system. i will admit that i don't use the G.P.S all that often but it is one of the many great toys the they have added on there car in the last few years.

 Now i can say the drawback to the car is the price it is a bit high, but i can say if you can afford it then get down to your local mercedes dealer and at least give this car the privilege of a test drive because it deserves it. <br><br>
