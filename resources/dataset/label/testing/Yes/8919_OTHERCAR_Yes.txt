            We bought our 1998 Grand Caravan because we needed a bigger van. We had a 1993 Caravan, which just didn't have the cargo room required for three children, a stroller, groceries, vacation gear, etc.! The Grand Caravan, which at thirteen inches longer, is just the right size. It is very comfortable for our family of five, and great for carpooling. After having the &quot;old style&quot; Caravan, I truly believe mothers must have been involved in designing the newer ones. I don't know how I managed with only one sliding door, because the additional one behind the driver makes it so much easier, especially when getting little ones in and out of car seats.
Keeping my fingers crossed as I write this, we have not had any problems with our van. The ride is very smooth and luxury car-like. The only thing that could be improved as far as the ride is that it is a little noisy, especially for highway driving. This would not be a drawback to buying one though, and I would definitely buy another Grand Caravan. In fact, in a magazine we get occasionally from Dodge, they were highlighting some of the changes and improvements they have made for 2001, and it sounds like they have made a great product even better.<br><br>
