            What does it take to make the �<b>European Car of the Year</b>?� Well, you must have just the right blend of key ingredients, not to mention a lot of hungry customers. The <b>Ford Focus</b> seems to have just the right recipe for that, clinching the award in 1999. Yes, Ford cooked up this &quot;world car&quot; to establish an even stronger foothold in the <i>European</i> market... and it worked.
Suffice it to say, Ford had a hit. A BIG hit. So tasty was the Focus for the European palate that Ford decided to try their luck in �The Motherland.� The less-than-successful Contour (badged the Mondeo in Europe) and Escort models will be discontinued next year in the U.S., and the Ford hopes the Focus will be a worthy successor.
So far, so good... review after review has been favorable. In fact, the Focus has been <b>selected as one of the &quot;10 Best&quot; cars for this year by <i>Car &amp; Driver.</i></b> 

But does the Focus have what it takes to appeal to everyday <i>American</i> interests and needs? I tend to discard initial reviews (even Car and Driver) because there always tends to be a little �new car� positive bias. So I ventured out with my girlfriend (who needs a new car) to investigate. After a day with the Focus, here are my impressions: 

<b>EXTERIOR:  8</b>
The press release for the Focus heralds its styling as &quot;...progressive, adventurous and distinctively different from the softer, more traditional proportions and silhouettes of other small cars.&quot; While opinions over the Focus� looks are certainly debatable, I agree that the sharp, edgy styling certainly gives the car distinctive styling over the competition, and gives it a <b>new appeal</b>. Plus, with new designs come new improvements: the Focus now boasts the <b>longest wheelbase in its class</b>, which translates into more interior room as well as improved ride and handling. The thing that I like most about the Focus� exterior is that it comes in three different body styles: a hatchback, a sedan, and a wagon. The hatchback appeals to the younger crowd with its low prices and sportier styling (commercials on MTV already abound for this model). The sedan and wagon appeal to the economically conscious singles/couples and families, respectively. I think the hatchback looks the coolest out of the trio (it�s the kid in me), but I already know the sedan will be the most popular. And because my girlfriend�s vote always overrules mine, our test drive was with the sedan model!

<b>INTERIOR: 8</b>
Before I describe the drive to you, let�s step inside. High seats and wide doors make entry and exit very easy in the front and the back. The seats feel supportive, although I question how long that will last. The dash is certainly functional, with every major control within easy reach of the driver- even comparable to the Honda Civic�s in its functionality and ease of use. To me, the �swooshy� styling leaves a little to be desired, and the plastic wood accents in the ZTS model we were driving look cheap. C�mon� the fact remains that this is an <i>economy</i> car and those �wood� accents aren�t going to fool anybody. My girlfriend disagrees vehemently with my reservations about the styling (and saw to it that I let you know). She was quite impressed with the interior. Other features she liked were excellent outward visibility and the height adjustment controls on the driver�s seat.
Better still is the interior room of the Focus. The long wheelbase makes for increased leg and cargo room, as mentioned previously. The high roof made for plenty of headroom: standing at 6�3�, I never felt claustrophobic. The Focus has the <b>most interior space in its class</b>, and that comes as little surprise to me.
The air conditioner is pretty strong, although I feel that darker colors (ours was beige) would take a little longer to cool than I would like. The stereo is unimpressive- a sad characteristic of Ford cars. The VW Jetta, for instance, comes standard with an 8-speaker system, which is far superior (in all fairness, it also comes standard with a higher price). One number the Focus� stereo has over many others is a <i>removable face</i>- an excellent safety feature against thieves. Just pop it off and take it with you. The standard power windows, locks, and mirrors worked well during our drive.
The backseat is roomy for a car in this class, and can be folded down for increased trunk capacity. Space in the trunk is ample. In addition, hydraulic struts are used to hold the trunk open as opposed to conventional hinges, which normally intrude into the cargo area. So, no need to worry about smashing any suitcases or glass sculptures. The trunk, by the way, passed our &quot;grocery test&quot; with flying colors, easily swallowing a cart full of groceries.
Overall, I can tell that a whole lot of thought (focus?) went into the Focus� interior, and <b>I commend Ford for a job well done</b>.

<b>ENGINE:  7</b>
If you�ve read any of my reviews, you know me by now. In typical �Tim Allen-esque� fashion, I have a natural craving for power... the Focus doesn�t have much. It�s 2.0L DOHC 4-banger gives out 130hp, which is <b>more than enough to get you around but <i>not</i> what I would call zippy</b> (0-60 in 9.6s). As a comparison, the Hyundai Elantra offers a class-leading 140hp engine that gives noticeably more oomph. I�d like to see Ford top that. Still, I feel it is a much better option than the standard SOHC engine, giving you 110 exasperated ponies. Shifts with the automatic are smooth, but it saps what little giddyap power is left and is hesitant to downshift. We drove the manual also and it definitely gets my recommendation. <i>Note: Rumor has it that 160 hp &quot;GT&quot; and 200-220 hp &quot;SVT&quot; models might be in the Ford recipe book. Watch out... extra spicy!</i>

<b>RIDE:  7</b>
As with the engine, the Focus didn�t do a whole lot of shining in the ride category. It was <b>satisfactory</b>- don�t misunderstand me- but no more than that. Engine noise is more than noticeable when reaching higher revs, and wind noise makes itself known at highway speeds. The ride itself is a few notches better than stiff, but also is confident without any rattles.

<b>HANDLING:  8</b>
The handling this little car gave us <b>pleasantly surprised me</b>. Steering was quick and responsive, though it needed a little correction here and there when cruising on the highway. It was fun to zip it around corners, and when taking a cloverleaf turn I only felt modest body lean. Further research uncovered that the Focus has better lateral grip than the Honda Civic.

<b>RELIABILITY:  7</b>
Although the Focus hasn�t had much time to prove itself here in the States, it had about <b>average</b> reliability in Europe- pretty standard for Ford vehicles. But lucky for you, I�m sure that the availability of Ford dealerships for you is more widespread than for our European friends. As a side note, Ford's increasing popularity in Europe is changing all that (according to a fellow auto expert, mkaresh).

<b>VALUE:  8</b>
I think the Focus gives you good bang� well� <i>go</i> for your buck. As far as compacts go, the choice of flavors for the Focus make it appealing to a variety of socioeconomic tastes. Prices shouldn�t top $17,000 for a loaded-to-the-gills model, according to my sources. In addition, a friend has informed me that Ford made sure the Focus was open to many after-market add-ons, so we may see some modified Focuses (Foci?) out there. I don�t know if I believe that the Focus is the <i>best</i> value in its class, but it�s certainly up there.

<b>THE VERDICT: FINALLY, A SMART MOVE BY FORD?</b>
I think that Ford�s onto something here. The Focus is a long overdue replacement for its aging cousin, the Escort, and some redeeming grace for its questionable Excursion project. (<i>While I�m on my soapbox, I�d like to say I�m glad Ford didn�t give the Focus another �E� name. Think about it: Escort, Explorer, Expedition, Excursion, Escape (soon to come)� I digress, I know. But I had to mention it.</i>)
Yes, I feel that the Focus will keep you happy with your purchase decision (assuming it proves reliable), so it gets my nod (for my girlfriend, too!). 
Does the Focus have what it takes to be the �<i>American</i> Car of the Year?� Well, I think that many ingredients are certainly in place. All it needs is a little stir from the American public and it�s ready.
