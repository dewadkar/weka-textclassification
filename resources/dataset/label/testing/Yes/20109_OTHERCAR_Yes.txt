            Why did I buy this car? Simply it�s passion.I have to say that�s my third BMW M,I had the 1990 M-3,1996 M-3 and in January 2000 the M 5.
The M series it�s something very special,only for people that loves a race car for the street.The M 3 are very funny cars,like go karts,a feeling like the Porsche 993,but the M 5 it�s amazing.
When I had the last M 3 ,after five years I was thinking which car I should buy,or the new M3 year 2001 or M 5.The new M 3 has a similar size to the older model,so I thought now it�s the time to get more space and
power.
I flew to Germany and I spoke with some BMW dealers,but they had not the car in stock with all the extras and colors I wanted.Finally I found one dealer in Holland that had in the showroom an spectacular M 5 ,metallic black,black leather, titanium inside,tv monitor,gps,telephone,digital audio system,crystal roof,...complete.The dealer had one M 5 for test,so when I drove on the motorway ,raining,the sound that I listen was like music.I feel the acceleration like a race motorbike and all the security systems like DSC 3,etc... they gave me a feeling that everything was under control.
You also have a sport switch,that switch gives higher revolutions and the steering wheel gets harder.I use to switch it when I drive on highways or mountain roads,because the sensation it�s spectacular.You can drive
on the 6 gear from 70 km to the top speed (max.show on the clock 270 km before injection cut-off).
Men�s if you are thinking to buy this car you have to be informed that your testosterona could take you to serious situations,because when you are on highway ,belive me ,if you don�t want no car will pass you.You only have to quick the gas to get an incredible acceleration and leave the cars far away in your mirror. 
It�s a very comfortable car to drive in the city or in long trips.
When I bought the car one of the things I was worried was the  city consumption that BMW was showing in their leaflets.I have to say that 
I had never match that 21 liters/100km.I use to make around 13-14 l/100km,and of course using the gas.
Something that�s incredible is after 32.000 km, I�m still using the original tires,thanks to all the security systems.
I have to inform that during the first warranty year I had some little problems in the car.If you decide to buy with inside titanium ,in some places suddenly starts to peel off,they don�t know why,but I saw it in more M 5s.The rest of the problems were,subwoofer,car computer fall,PDC
one eye was out of order,...but I have to say that all those little things they had been replaced new by the BMW agent in Spain,without any
trouble,so the service was very good.
I only find a problem with the M5,which car will be next??
Very difficult,but at this moment I don�t want think about it let�s BMW
Motorsport to think for me.
I think after reading this letter you can find out if you like this type of car or to choose something else,but if you decide to buy it
I think you are making a great choice,and of course buy it with all the equipment,you will enjoy them.

This is pure passion ,how will it be our live without passion?
