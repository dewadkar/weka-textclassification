            We drove an Olds Silo Van with touring suspension on a 2600 mile trip and then 2 weeks later drove the SuperCrew on a 3000 mile trip.
The wife says "I want to take the truck on any trips from now on" that pretty much says it all.
1. The truck handles well. The suspension is comfortable, a lot like the large luxury cars, but with a performance feel to it. There was no doubt we were riding in a truck with a (car like) ride, but we think that was a +++++. 

2. In the interior the amount of headroom and legroom is phenomenal! I am 6'4"and my wife is 5'3", the electronic pedal adjuster is just what we need for both drivers to be comfortable.

3. With the hard lid on the bed we were able to take a lot of extra gear to Yellowstone, most of which we used, yet I can haul topsoil for yard work and just hose out the bed when I am done, you can't do that with an SUV.

4. The SuperCrew construction is quality, with a solid, durable feel. There are no squeaks or rattles. This truck is practical for my primary purposes - lite cargo hauling, yard work, around-the-house chores, and to and from work, added to that we will now take it on all long trips.
