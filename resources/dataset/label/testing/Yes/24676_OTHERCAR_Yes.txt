            Hello !  My Name is Deborah Loyd. On November 26th.1999, My Family purchased their third Minivan. The first two were GMC Safari's, 1986 and 1993 models. We travel a lot and these were great for traveling with two smaller children, dog, etc. We noticed In January of this year that our latest GMC would need replaced fairly soon. It had led a good long life and had accumulated over 120.000mi. We have elderly family members out of state and we always have to be ready to run on very little notice, and sometimes very little cash. 
I have Fibromyalgia and Arthritis, My husband brought up the subject of buying a car this time, so that I would not have to climb up into a van. I loved the space of the van and knew that I would not be satisfied with a car as long as we still have kids at home. We have a 16 year old daughter and a 12 year son. We are always using the space for baseball equipment and dance or art projects. Not to mention the occasional friends that accompany our children at times.
I told my husband to find something that was easier accessible to me and still keep the room of the van. I held little hope, because I had looked inside and even been a passenger in smaller vans. My GMC had them beaten in space. We even discussed getting a suburban, but this was just out of our Budget.
My husband Larry, met my challenge. Our GMC van started having major repair needs in the early fall. We decided that we really needed to get busy and find something new. He asked me if I had seen the new Chevrolet Venture and I had only seen the commercials for the Loony Tune series. He got online and had an information package sent to us. I still had my doubts because it still just looked small to me.
The week of Thanksgiving we decided that since he had a couple of days off, that we would look around and see what was available.
We had several possibilities that we had considered and talked about looking at them.
The day after Thanksgiving we got up and decided that since it was the busiest shopping day of the year, maybe we would avoid the crowds at the malls by just shopping for a new vehicle instead. We went straight to the Local Chevy dealer, &quot;Leo Martin&quot;. Dave Henderson, our Salesman came out and showed us the &quot;Ventures&quot;. I was amazed at the interior space, It had much more available space than the Safari, and I could get in as easily as if it were a car, a luxury car I might add. The Venture had so many features that made it almost sell itself. It has it all, comfort, easy fold seats that allow more room. The comfort features and easy access to all controls made it a pleasure to drive. We took it out for a test drive, where usually we discuss, what we want to look at next, But this time, We only discussed which color we wanted. This is the first new Vehicle we have ever bought that was unchallenged by competition. The price was right for us, the fuel economy is very good, this one even has a computer that measures fuel economy,estimates mileage per tank,gives outside temperatures, and has a compass readout. Plus much more.
We even got a better deal when we added it onto our insurance. Our rates actually came down, And we have a teenage driver. They came down because of the anti theft and safety features that are on the Venture. I am one very satisfied customer.
