            Nikon brings about round 2 of the 5 MegaPixel wars with the CoolPix 5700.  Nikon released an awesome camera in the CoolPix 5000 about a year ago and now releases this monster upgrade to the 5000.

My experience with the CoolPix 5700 isn't from an owner's perspective this time (I can't afford to buy every new toy/gadget/technology that comes out there).  A good friend of mine purchased the 5700 and I was able to compare it to my collection of digital cameras.

<i><b>The Short Take</b>

A major update to the 5000 model Nikon CoolPix line, you get an optical zoom of 8x combined with a 5 MegaPixel camera.  Not enough to wet your whistle?  You get legendary Nikon feature sets, 4x digital zoom on top of the optical zoom, the ability to add several Nikon accessories like external flashes and lens, and a cool Electronic Viewfinder.

However, all these features are not without its price.  The MRSP of the CoolPix 5700 is a princely $1199.  A major hinderence to purchasing this camera.  The use of the Electronic ViewFinder (EVF) looks cool but puts a bit of a strain on the batteries...  on top of that, you can't turn off the LCD to take photos since there is no optical viewfinder.  If you'll looking for a small camera then look elsewhere, this is NOT a small camera.

Overall, this is a great camera but a little too pricey for the general public.  If you need a camera with a high megapixel count, ridiculously long zoom, and tons... and I mean tons of features, the CoolPix 5700 is a good choice if you have the cash!  Personally, I find the 4500 to be a better choice for my uses... and more cost effective as well.

<b>Pros:</b>

1) 5 MegaPixel Camera (really a bit more than 4.9 megapixels at 2560x1920 resolution)
2) 8x Optical Zoom
3) EVF
4) Nikon Feature set for the camera
5) slightly upgraded color accurracy from CoolPix 5000
6) Solid construction
7) Easy to Use
8) 1.8 inch swivel monitor
9) Hot Shoe for external flashes
10) Uses Compact Flash Type II card
11) Standard EN-EL1 battery used in all the high end Nikon consumer digital cameras even the 995 model
12) Accessories!
13) Can use 2CR5 battery if you're hard up for power!

<b>Cons:</b>

1) PRICE
2) EVF
3) High battery consumption
4) Small memory card included in package... need to buy a bigger one
5) Many similarities to CoolPix 5000... and $200 more expensive if you don't need the 8x zoom (3x on the 5000)
6) Some design issues

</i><b>Camera Details</b>

This camera has too many features and details to include for the scope of this review... you can www.nikon.com for the lists of feature sets and details. Other review sites like www.dpreview.com and www.imaging-resource.com have extensive previews on pre-production models and hands-on on production models with sample photos as well.  Epinions.com member Howard_Creech also wrote an excellent review for feature sets and how he found the use of these features from the perspective of a professional photographer.

Again, I don't claim to be a photographer... professional or otherwise.  I buy/play with electronics because I love gadgets.  I don't know how to apply the more advanced features of these cameras... heck, I'm still learning the feature sets of my Canon PowerShot S40, S330, and my latest camera... the Nikon CoolPix 4500!

I should get back to the CoolPix 5700... huh?

The 5700 has dimensions of 4.3 x 3.0 x 4.0 in... so it is not a small camera by any means.  It weighs a hefty 16.8 oz.  Note that the weight is prior to adding a memory card or battery to the unit!  Compare that to the CoolPix 4500 which has dimenions of 5.1 x 2.9 x 2.0 inches with a weight of 13.2 oz.  For comparison sake, the Canon PowerShot S40 is 4.4 x 2.3 x 1.7 inches and 11.4 oz.

I guess if you could place the 5700 into a very large jacket pocket... however, I wouldn't recommend it.  The overall design is very reminiscent of the 5000 CoolPix.  It retains much of the CoolPix 5000 look and feel overall.  There is an easy to grip area on the right side of the camera... although I don't think I would use the camera one handed.  The increased weight of the camera make it a bit unwieldly for one handed use... at least it did to me.

Like the CoolPix 5000, you still have a 1.8 inch supposedly 110,000 pixel (hey it's only a 1.8 inch monitor) color LCD that can swivel out.  For the price of the camera, you do get anti-glare coating on this LCD.  The EVF is for all purposes a mini version of the 1.8 inch LCD.  You can call up all the menu functions and selections on the EVF as you can with the regular color LCD.  It gives the camera a nice coolness factor although a bit impractical when I tried accessing the menu this way.  The text on the screen is small (duh... due to the EVF's size) and in actual use... the unit is close to your face (so you can see what's on the EVF) so it is difficult to access the buttons on parts of the camera.

The right side of the camera holds the cover to the Compact Flash Type II card slot (accepts IBM's Microdrive too!) and an eyelet for the camera strap.  There is also a rubberized surface to help grip the camera.  The left side of the camera holds a second eyelet and a panel that covers the A/V out, DC power in, and I/O digital ports.  Since the left side is quite large (due mostly to the huge lens), Nikon added a few controls to the left side.  These include 4 control buttons such as flash/ISO, Image Quality and Size, AE/AF Lock, and Focus mode.  This makes it easier to use some of the functions of the camera when you're looking through the EVF.  The top of the camera has a B&W LCD display for camera settings and the like (battery power), a hot shoe for flash accessories, a power switch, exposure compensation, mode, function, and illuminate buttons.  Oh yeah, you have a shutter button too.  The bottom of the camera you have a centered tripod slot.  You also have the battery cover on the bottom of the camera... thank goodness Nikon stuck with the EN-EL1 battery used with the most of the high end CoolPix cameras.

The back of the camera you have a monitor select button, a rocker button for the zoom, a menu button, quick view button, mode switch, 4 way D-pad for menu choices, erase and display buttons.  I've already talked about the EVF and 1.8 inch swivel color LCD.

Despite the tons of buttons on the unit, the 5700 can still be used as a point and shoot camera.  Good for naive photographers like me.  Of course, you probably didn't have to buy the 5700 if you just needed a point and shoot camera.

<b>Shots and Colours</b>

Overall, to me the 5700 seemed to be slightly better with color accuracy although slightly less saturated and bright compared to the 5000.  You can easily take 8.5 x 11 photos without a loss in detail and with good color reproduction.  Since this is a 5 MegaPixel camera, I believe the actual pixels correspond to a 5x9 picture... (I keep forgeting the conversion of MegaPixels to 35mm print film sizes).  The 8x zoom... geez... there's no reason not to get a decent shot with the above average quality lens on the 5700.

Overall, the 5700 gets some great shots in average lighting conditions.  I did not try the camera in low light or harsh/very bright light conditions.

Personally, I preferred the CoolPix 4500 pictures over the 5700 in colour saturation.  I'm unsure whether the 4500 and 5700 use the same color deciphering programs.

<b>Bonuses</b>

The CoolPix 5700 can utilize standard flashes on the hot shoe and several lens accessories from Nikon.  The hot shoe is a very nice touch.  I can't comment much about lens accessories since my friend didn't buy any yet.

<b>Battery Life</b>

The 5700 drains power rather quickly since you always have one of the LCDs on whether it is the EVF or the 1.8 inch monitor.  I got about 150 shots with the 1.8 LCD on.  I was using the same EN-EL1 battery from my old CoolPix 995 camera.

<b>Features</b>

This camera has way too many feature for me to go into in this epinions review... heck, I don't know what some of these features are (remember, I'm still learning the feature sets of even my much less complicated S330 PowerShot as well the PowerShot S40 and CoolPix 4500).  You can choose from multiple resolutions from as low as 640x480 to the maximum 2560x1920 and save to 3 different picture formats (JPEG, TIFF, and RAW) with 3 level of compression for JPEG files.  There is a choice of 2 image ratios 4:3 and 3:2.  ISO of 100, 200, 400, and 800 can be selected.  There are multiple white balance modes, a full manual setting, adjustments for aperture and shutter priority, various metering settings, a noise reduction mode for sharper pictures, the ability to shoot short movie clips, multiple flash modes... and more features.  This is an extremely feature rich camera!

This is one of the most... if not the most feature rich cameras for its price range.

<b>Minor quibbles</b>

At least Nikon decided to include a 32MB Compact Flash card... you can stick a few more photos on that card.  This is a 5 MegaPixel camera... if you plan on using the best possible settings for picture quality, you would be lucky to get 10 shots on the 32 MB CF card.  I would highly recommend buying a CF card with a minimum of 128MB memory... and suggest a 256MB over the 128MB.

Because of the high battery demand for the 5700, I would also recommend a second if not a third Lithium-Ion battery.  The good part is that the battery can be purchased from third parties for as low as $35.  That's what I got my EN-EL1 battery for (not made by Nikon however).

<b>Overall</b>

This is a great camera overall.  Definite a must buy if you require a 5 MegaPixel camera with 8x zoom.  However, if you don't require some of the high end feature of this camera, the CoolPix 5000 is a better choice at MSRP of $899 (5 MegaPixel and 3x optical zoom).  I actually preferred the CoolPix 4500 which retails at $699 (4 MegaPixel and 4x zoom).  The camera I've listed have extremely similar feature sets.

I'm not a professional photographer in any sense of the word.  At best, I'd say I'm a casual photographer who loves gadgets.

Regardless, Nikon continues to prove why they are such great camera makers and why they have such a large and loyal following in the camera industry.  If the camera fits your needs, buy it!
