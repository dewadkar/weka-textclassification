            I was just looking at cars at a local dealer when I saw a 1999 Black Accord EX V6.  Since I only look at 6 cylinders this immediately got a fair share of my attention.  After 1 minute I had to get the keys and give it a drive, the first Honda I have ever driven mind you.

I suppose at this point I fell totally in love and after 20 minutes left a down payment and took it home a few days later.

Now for the good stuff,- IT IS FAST!!  I know a lot of people say that about cars, but this is really and truly quick.  It only comes in stick at this level but it works just as well in my opinion.  It has every luxury you could think of, sunroof, climate control, cd player, cruise and other stuff that is equally as cool.  It drives better than any car I've ever had and that's saying alot.

Now, bad stuff-If you smoke, good luck. No ashtray!!!
And dont take this the wrong way, but the transmission was replaced 2 weeks after I got it.  The car had 33,000 miles on it so I'm chalking it up to that.  I will say the dealership was really good and the Honda factory warantee was no problem to work with.
