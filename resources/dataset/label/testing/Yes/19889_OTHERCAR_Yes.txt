               The Hewlett Packard 635 Photosmart camera packs a lot of options into a compact package.  After a bad experience with a previous HP camera, we hesitantly decided to give HP a second try.  We were pleasantly surprised!  

   We are impressed with the camera's focus.  Every picture we have taken results in beautiful color and clarity.  With a total of 12X zoom you have a wide range of choices. (3X optical, 4X digital)

   Another feature we were pleasantly surprised with was the video option.  We really doubted it's ability to take descent videos, but it has proved us wrong.  The color and clarity are great.  The sound is lacking but present.  This is a memory hog however so be prepared to buy extra memory cards.  

   There are more picture options than the average person would use, but it is nice to have the ability to change the camera's picture taking parameters.  Some of these include: self timer, EV compensation, exposure mode, white balance, ISO speed, color, saturation, & sharpness.

   The buttons are laid out very smartly and easy to use.  There is nearly no lag between the button press and the picture being taken, as experienced with our other HP camera.  It is very easy to scroll through options and pictures with the navigation button pad.

   Camera uses 2-AA batteries which we suggest should be rechargeable, since this camera uses them up really fast.  Camera also comes with 16MB of memory built in, but we also suggest the optional memory card, at least 128MB.  Connection is through USB (provided) or optional docking station.
