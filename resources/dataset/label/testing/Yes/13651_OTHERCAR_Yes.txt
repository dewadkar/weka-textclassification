            I used to hate large vehicles. When I drove my last car, I hated not being able to see anything more than the rear-end of some huge road hogging SUV, pickup truck or van. So, I decided that in order to have a better view of the road, I needed to get higher up.

No having much cash flow, I looked at some of the entry level SUV's, like to Honda and the Toyota. Both seemed cheap and clunky. The dashboard didn't fit right and the seats were uncomfortable. Then, I drove the Kia Sportage. Less expensive than the other two models, everything looked well built. So, I bought it.

I got the 2WD EX package (who *really* needs 4WD in Florida?) for about $18,000, and that includes power windows, locks, CD player, AC, and alarm system.

Now, I can see the road in front of me, and I'm very very happy. I have 31000 miles on it in less than 18 months, and I've had no real trouble with it. I strongly recommend the Kia Sportage as the best entry-level SUV out there.<br><br>
