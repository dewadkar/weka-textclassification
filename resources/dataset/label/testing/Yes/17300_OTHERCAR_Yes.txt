            The main advantage American cars have over their import counterparts is price.  Most American cars offer more features at a lower price than Japanese or European cars.  The Chevrolet Malibu does, in fact, offer many features at a fairly low price.  The trouble is, once a car like the Malibu moves into the low $20,000s there are many, many great choices.  The Malibu must measure up to the big boys in the mid-size car marketplace � Camry, Accord and Taurus to name only three.

From the outside, the 2001 Malibu is a good looking car.  While Camry and Accord are somewhat bland in their styling, the Malibu has slightly sportier look � it�s not so generic.  The Chevrolet Malibu and Saturn�s L series cars seem to share some styling cues, and in LS trim, the Malibu seems to be a more substantial car.  15 in. wheels and fog lights give the Malibu LS the looks of a more expensive car.

Inside the Malibu is exactly what you�d expect.  The LS has optional  leather seating, but the material feels more like a synthetic leather. The LS is available with an optional sliding sunroof, which is quite large. Honda�s idea to put the sunroof switch on the dash is terrific, more companies should use this.  Seats in the Malibu are comfortable, and long trips should be no problem, however the cloth seats seem a little more comfortable than the leather.  Rear passenger room is adequate, but may be a bit cramped for taller adults.  At first glance the interior of the Malibu seems to be smaller than Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus, actually it is just as large as both the Camry and Accord.  In fact, the Malibu has more front head room than the Camry and more rear seat leg room than both Camry and Accord. Look can be deceiving.  

Toyota and Honda have yet to offer the RDS (Radio Data System) system found on many GM car stereos.  It is a way to quickly find radio stations broadcasting the information or music you want to hear.  Press the �TRAF� button, and the radio will find a station giving a traffic update.  The same goes for types of music, turn the knob until the screen reads �country,� and the radio will find a country station, this is a great feature for travelers. (all stations don�t yet have the signal RDS reads, it is more common in larger cities).  The stereo in the Malibu has only 4 speakers, well short of the 6 or 8 found in many of its competitors.  Frankly the stereo sounds fine, and you�d swear they�ve hidden some extra speakers under the seats or something.

On the road, the Malibu LS lives up to its sporty looks.  Handling is fairly well controlled, and body roll is minimal.  The 3.1L V-6 makes 170 hp, far short of Camry and Accord�s near 200 hp.  So far the Malibu seems like worthy competition for the import sedans, and on paper this is true.  The Malibu looks great on paper.  However, one stint behind the wheel of a Toyota Camry and it is painfully obvious where the Malibu falls short.  There is a level of refinement cars like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and even the Nissan Maxima deliver that the Malibu simply cannot touch.  From behind the wheel, the Toyota Camry feels like a car that should cost $40,000.  Granted you don�t get standard features like fog lights, alloy wheels,  and a power trunk release, but both Camry and Accord make up for this deficit in sheer engineering genius. 

The main advantage with a car like the Malibu is value/price.  In LS trim, with a sunroof and leather, the Malibu can easily hit the $24,000 mark.  That is too much for a Malibu.  Lay off the luxury items and you can raise the price to value ratio back to where it belongs. 

The Malibu is not bad car, it is simply adequate.  If you are on a VERY strict budget, then the Malibu allows you to get a good sized car, for an economy price � just say no to the extras. A Honda Accord or Toyota Camry will probably cost more, but one short drive in either of those cars and it will be obvious where the money was spent.

This car is recommended only for those on a tight budget, or those shopping for their first family car. The base sedan starts at $17,605, while the LS starts at just over $21,000.
