            I walked into a Ford Showroom in September of 1996 and first saw the new Ford Expedition. I drove it that day and leased it that week. The Expedition is a vehicle that has so many purposes wrapped into one. It can be a luxurious driver or a hard tough work vehicle. The Expedition handles very well but maybe has a little too much body lean. The vehicle feels extremely safe and stops well. Another knock on the Expedition is the gas mileage. All in all my experience is a most favorable one and would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
