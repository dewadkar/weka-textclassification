            I bought my Corolla new for &lt; $10k and have had the typical Toyota reliability problems-NONE.  I wanted a car to commute back and forth to work on my 60 mile round trip.  I wanted something inexpensive to buy and maintain and the Corolla fit the bill.  I got the 5 speed and a/c as the only options.

Engine-INCREDIBLE-I have over 185k miles on the car and have not had a single problem.  With the 5 speed, it has plenty of pep and goes from 0-60 mph pretty quickly.  I can still chirp the tires in 2nd gear.  The manual transmission gets the most out of the engine.  The original clutch shows no signs of fading.

Interior-The grey cloth seats are still in excellent shape, even the driver's seat.  The hardware is a tad cheap, but as good as most in its price range.  I had to replace one of the inside door handles and a window knob ($12 total cost).  Other than tires, brakes, mufflers, this was the only thing that would not be considered normal.  

Brakes-This is definitely the weak point of the car.  I found the brakes to lack good emergency stopping ability.  But my emergency stops are a lot harder than most people.

I planned on selling the car when I bought my new Maxima (great car), but decided to keep it to drive in snowy weather.  With the 5 speed and front wheel drive, the car is like a snowmobile in the snow.  I have never gotten stuck and I live in the northeast.

If you are looking for a great commuter vehicle that costs nothing to maintain, this is the car for you.  Toyotas last forever, so don't be afraid to get a used one with &gt;100k miles-they are just getting broken in.  The car would also be good for families of 4 or less.
