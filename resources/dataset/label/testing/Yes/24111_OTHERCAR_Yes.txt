               I own a 1991 Legend &quot;L&quot; Coupe, I purchased it about 4 years ago as a replacement for my 1988 Porsche 944. While I was immediately impressed with its abundant horsepower(200 stock) its handling attributes left something to be desired compared with my 944. Legend Coupes are front drive vehicles and about 60% of there weight is over the front tires. This configuration makes them tend to plow going into corners too hard. The fact that Acura equips them with fairly soft springs make it even worse.

 Shortly after buying my Coupe I purchased a set of lowering springs,I dropped the ride height of my Legend 1.5 inches. I also purchased a set of 17&quot; wheels along with &quot;Z&quot; rated tires. Doing this transformed my Legend Coupe from a luxury sports coupe into a sports luxury coupe. Corners that had my tires squealing at 40mph were now being taken flat and fast at 55mph.

    My next upgrade was to have DINAN engineering install a engine management chip. Dinan claims that their chip increases horsepower in a Legend to 214, and they claim torque goes up to 233 ft.lbs. I didn't notice any significant performance differences after installing their chip but my next upgrade could be heard as well as felt.

     I've always enjoyed the sound of a healthy exhaust note coming from a car. Sometimes I'd rather just listen to that then the stereo. I added a GREDDY stainless steel exhaust system to my car and love the sounds it makes. Once again manufacturers make all sorts of claims regarding horsepower gains, Greddy claims 10+ hp gain with this system but who am I to dispute them. This upgrade coupled with the Dinan chip really seems to have made my coupe wake up and come alive. 

    I've sort of gotten of track here discussing upgrades rather than the car itself. This is really a great coupe, and with an overall length of 192 inches it really is a pretty large car, 4&quot; longer than a BMW 5 series. It does not however look or drive as large as it actually is. When I first purchased this car 4 years ago it had 80,000 miles on it. Today it has 150,000 miles and has been virtually trouble free. The quality of materials Acura uses to assemble this vehicle is first rate. 

Its leather bucket seats are easily the most comfortable I've ever sat in. The stock Bose stereo with optional CD changer in the trunk is the best stock stereo I've ever listened to. The steering wheel mounted stereo controls are a great idea as well. I think what impresses my most about this car is that after 150,000 miles this car is still totally free of any squeaks or rattles and looks more like a car that has been only 50,000 miles. Would I buy another? Absolutely!! Too bad Acura stopped making Legends after the 1995 model year. There are still plenty of excellent used Legends for sale out there. I'd recommend 2nd generation cars(those produced from 91-95)

 My personal favorite to keep an eye out for would be 93-95 coupes. These were available with a 6 speed manual transmission and put out a healthy 230 horsepower in stock form. I'd imagine with a few simple upgrades 260 horsepower would be a reasonable goal. Happy shopping.<br><br>
