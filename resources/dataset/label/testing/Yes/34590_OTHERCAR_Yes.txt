            The Saturn SC2 is a fun, safe, economical and sporty vehicle.  With its 16 valve engine, it definitely has a lot of pick-up for a 4 cylinder engine.  It hugs curves very well and drives very smoothly.
This car is not the best choice for anyone over 5'10&quot; or so.  My husband is 6'4&quot; and has to lay his seat back to avoid his head hitting the roof.  But at 5'5&quot;, it's perfect for me.
Similar cars in this type class include the Ford Probe and Mitzibishi Eclipse.  Neither have the protective door structure like that of the Saturn.  Saturn also offers a 36,000 totally inclusive warranty package that replaces anything from bumper to bumper.  This warranty is included and not an additional option.  Another bonus for Saturn's - one price, no haggling (unless of course you buy from a private owner like I did).  I own a 1995 Saturn SC2 and have found that it has held its NADA value very well.
I'm at 81,000 thousand miles and am looking forward to the purchase of my next Saturn - I'll never drive another car again.
