            I must say that this report will be very biased. My wife bought a brand new Geo Storm in 1993 and ever since I met her, we've had problems with it. Finally, last Thursday and at 106K+ miles, the transmission went out. We had first and reverse, but when you live 50 miles from work you can't even limp it home. Luckily, it happened right before she picked me up so we just left it at my work.

We had to make an emergency purchase so we went out looking right away Thursday night. We first saw a Dodge Neon. I thought they were pretty good cars, at least I hadn't heard anything bad about them.

I must admit though, I never knew anyone who had owned one. After I found out about the head-gasket problem here on epinions, I quickly started looking at other options. My first choice was a Ford Contour. However, I felt that if we could get a good deal on a Taurus we'd go for that. The Taurus is just a lot more car for the dollar.

We went to a local dealer and my wife fell in love with a light amethyst, (sort of charcoal metallic gray with a purple pearl) LX model. I wasn't crazy about the color, but the options blew me away. Leather, CD changer, moon roof, climate control, keyless entry, and something the Geo didn't have, cruise control.

I took it out for a test drive and it handled superbly. Almost as good as the Geo. The ride was comfortable yet sporty. I wouldn't suggest driving this on a country, gravel road, but on an open back highway this car shines. I drove it for about 30 minutes and had decided this was going to be our next car. Of course, my wife had already decided and my opinion didn't really matter.

I love the 3.0L Duratech engine. The 24-valve really has a lot of get up and go. I call this biased because the Geo didn't have any gumption and you had to dangle a big piece of cheese to get it to go up a steep hill.
There really is no comparison on the two cars.

So far, we love it, but since it is a used car, I am a little skeptical about it. I will report later if there are any problems.<br><br>
