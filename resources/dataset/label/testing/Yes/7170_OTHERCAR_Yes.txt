            When I made my Astro purchase in 1996, it pretty much came down to Astro vs the Chrysler Minivans. I fell in love with the Astro because it is a real van, it looks like a van, it drives like a van. The driver sits higher up and consequently gets a better view of the road, not to mention a boost to the ego. Last time I checked, the Astro and the Town & Country have the same cubic footage, but the Astro is taller, while the Chrysler is longer.  I am 6'2" and I like lots of overhead. 

I loved the way the new Astro looks and I still love it today. I think it is one of the best van styles to come along in years, 'specially that grill. It's a matter of taste. I also was pretty much bowled over by the new interior, especially the overhead lights and compartments. I am extremely pleased with the ample supply of interior amenities, pockets, compartments, cargo nets, and so forth.

The dutch door in the back is an immensely valuable addition all by itself. It is essential for easy loading and unloading of groceries and any other items. I especially recommend getting power, remote controlled door locks (along with the non-standard security system which I picked up for an extra $500 at the time of purchase). At the press of a button on your key ring, the rear hatch pops open, or the doors open. Unbelievable convenience. 

I was aware of Consumer Reports' statistical reviews on GM cars -- very good on the power and drive train, less favorable on the little details. My experiences have been somewhat consistent with this. Little things do break or need replacing here and there. But after 80,000 miles, what does one expect? Well, I'll provide a laundry list of the items. 

in 80000 miles I have:

1) never tuned up and the van still runs quite well, will get tuned before I reach 100K
2) had the trans fluid changed twice, no trans problems whatsoever
3) had the brake pads changed maybe 3  times (pretty good!)
4) now in my first year on the third set of tires
5) The pneumatic "mighty lifts" for the rear hatch have been replaced twice
6) Jusst had the compressor of the AC rebuilt for $760, some of the seals had allowed all refrigerant to leak out
7) The windshield wiper control module has been replaced once
8) The rear bench seats have developed a small hole where one of the springs or some such hardware has worn through the seat fabric a little bit. Whether this is due to the fact that I have 2 kids, I can't say. Seems like a manufacturing defect since the same wear spot occurs in the same place on both bench seats.
9) Front air control panel keeps popping out of it's seating. Each time he removes the dash and puts it back in, he swears there's no way it can ppo out again, but it does.
10) Shocks were recently replace for the first time -- buy em at auto supply at $20/ea!

In terms of my original order, my only regret is that I didn't order the rear air conditioning. On long trips, and in Summer especially, the back of the van can get a little stuffy. I definitely recommend getting the rear ventilation system. At $500 extra, it would have been well worth it.

I have used the Astro for carrying kayaks to the ocean and to lakes. A few weeks ago I drove in the snow with chains in Lake Arrowhead -- great fun! On an evening of heavy snow, we piled 12 Scouts into the van for a short hop to the Lodge. 

The Astro is uniquely capable in it's towing capacity, but I have not yet installed a tow hitch, because I really don't have anything to tow....yet. towing capacity is one of those things that'll be there in case I need it.

I have owned two Chevys in my life, and I have been more happy with both of them than with any other cars I've owned. The other one was a used 71 Chevy Camaro. Wonderful car from my salad days. Too bad I had to sell it at the time. One recommendation: always try to buy a used car from a lady, not from a man.

While I unfortunately do not have a garage to put the Astro in, I have steadfastly made a sincere effort to really take care of this "car" I love so much, wash it regularly, change the oil every 3500 miles or so, and I also occasionally like to have the interior professionally cleaned once in a while. 

I plan to continue driving the Astro as long as I can. I'd rather pay an occasional repair bill than go back on the ritual of payments. As I recall, my original payment schedule was $5000 down and $525 a month for three years.

Would I buy it again? Yes. Not much has really changed since '96 in terms of what's available out there. All the Ford and Chrysler and now even Toyota offerings look like each other. I really liked the Previa, but Toyota doesn't make it anymore -- what a shame. That was a great looking van! But then too, I love the Astro grill and front end. Let's face it, the emotional thing that motivates anyone to buy anything in America is the shine. Sell the shine. 

The Astro is a solidly built, industrial-strength van that'll leave room to grow for your family. Sorry if I sound like a spokesman for GM, but I ain't (sic), and I'm not joking. Good luck to you.
