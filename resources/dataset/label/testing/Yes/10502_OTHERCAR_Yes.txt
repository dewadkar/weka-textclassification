            I purchased my TL about 2 months ago.  It's the third Acura I've owned, so I may be a bit prejudiced.
The TL's combination of comfort, handling, acceleration, safety features and terrific list of standard features is tough to beat.  
No one will confuse the TL with a sports car, but it handles well, has that terrific Acura steering, excellent brakes, hauls 4 adults in great comfort, and goes when you put your foot in it!  The trunk is large - we put a couple of golf bags and 3 suitcases in it for a recent trip.  My mileage - a combination of city and highway driving - is averaging 25mpg, and the car has less than 4,000 miles on the odometer.
The list of standard features is incredible:  ABS, traction control, VTEC engine (225hp), Bose sound system with CD, cruise, 5 speed auto with manual shift option, security system, keyless entry, outside temp gauge, auto rearview mirror, alloys, heated seats, heated mirrors, power everything, moonroof, leather, high intensity discharge headlamps, the list goes on and on.  The only factory option is the GPS navigation system, which actually is considered a separate model.
The car is good looking in an understated manner.  Don't put a front plate on it!  Ours is White Diamond Pearl with parchment leather.  Of course the car looks a bit smaller in the darker colors...  something to keep in mind. 
A tip or two on buying this - or any new car, for that matter:  do it at the end of the month, when dealers are striving to hit their monthly quotas; try to remain as dispassionate as possible - people do goofy things when they get really emotional; and, check prices at Autobytel.com or Carprices.com and ask the dealer to match or beat them.  My local dealer matched the Autobytel.com price; it ended up being a hassle-free experience and I got a good deal.
The TL is rock solid and unflappable, and everything about it - the switchgear, the sound the doors make when you shut them, the shifter action - has a positive, solid, QUALITY feel to it. Love it, and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a high quality, luxurious, ultra-dependable (read:  Honda) sedan for under $30K.<br><br>
