            An excellent minivan in every way. The best feature is the back seats that fold into the floor very easily (I can fold them down and I'm 8 months pregnant).  The back seats also become "tailgaitor" seats, which is a cute feature for picnics, etc. The ride is smooth and the seats are comfortable.  The a/c and heating work well, but the rear a/c option (about $595) is very important to get so it doesn't get overheated for passengers in back. 

Lots of cup holders and other intelligent interior design (radio controls on the steering wheel, a little table between the two front seats, CD storage bin in front). The middle two seats can be easily pulled apart for a more roomy feel (or if you have two kids who fight when they are sitting too close together). Nice CD/radio system, and the van looks very stylish and sleek.  It is not too big, and is easy to drive and park, but large enough to fit 7 people comfortably, as well as lots of cargo.  

It drives better than my husband's Toyota Camry--a smooth ride with excellent pick-up, and decent gas mileage for a larger vehicle.  I recommend it highly.  Plus the price was much less than the competitors. We paid $20,700, which included about $1000 in options (including the rear a/c).  A good deal, especially compared to the Honda Odessey, which is much more expensive, and the first trim level doesn't even come with a CD player, which seems so standard nowadays.  

I have never driven as nice a vehicle as the Mazda MPV (and my husband loves it too!). I feel it is safe, reliable choice for families with kids, and/or people who need a vehicle with lots of space, but don't want to drive a huge van.  The MPV is a roomy van, but feels more like a car in handling.  Great car!
