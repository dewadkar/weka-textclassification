            2002 has seen a lot of changes in the auto industry.  One of them is the rediscovery of the sportscar, thanks to the new Nissan 350Z.  Also from Nissan is a new family sedan set to take on the likes of the top-selling Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.  It's the new-for-2002 Nissan Altima.  So what's so special about this not-exactly-nondescript 4-door?  Read on, and you shall see.

The new Altima is a totally new car, and shares nothing with its previous iteration except the name and that little badge on the hood.  The model I test-drove was the 2.5SL, and was equipped with the 2.5L four-cylinder.  Now I'm sure you're thinking, 4-cylinder=dumpy acceleration, but this was not the case.  That little four-banger has quite a bit of get-up-and-go for its size, and the majority of buyers should be quite satisfied with it.  The motor is rated at 175HP--more than Honda or Toyota's base 4-cylinder.  The Altima is also available with a 240HP 3.5L V6, but I don't think the more powerful six suits the character of this car.  This is a vehicle made for schlepping kids and such to and fro, and in this respect it would perform well.  The automatic transmission in this car was typical Japanese.  In other words, it doesn't hunt, it doesn't jerk, it just does its job quietly and that's about that.  It did its job well enough that I almost forgot to mention it.

Ride and handling are a strong point of this car.  While not BMW-caliber by any stretch of the imagination, the ride was pleasant, soaking up various bumps and irregularities with relative ease.  Handling was also quite good (as I found out in a surprise emergency maneuver), and the car felt composed even as I was tossing it from one side of the freeway to the other to avoid a ladder in the middle of the lane. (don't ask)  The steering is well-weighted in this type of car.  It's not too heavy, not too light, and has a good on-center feel.

The interior of the car is a little bit of a mixed bag.  It felt a shade or two on the small side to me, but not extremely so.  The seats were comfortable enough both front and back, and there should be enough room in the rear for an adult to situate himself relatively comfortably.  The driver's seat is a nice place to be in this car, however.  The test vehicle I had was pretty well loaded, with heated leather seats, an in-dash CD changer, auto up and down windows, ABS and side-impact airbags.  I'm a little disappointed that ABS was only an option on this car, and not standard. (this is true of most Japanese sedans of this caliber).  The instruments are easy to read and placed in three round recesses in the dash.  HVAC and stereo controls were also an excersise in simplicity.  Why, oh WHY must luxury car manufacturers feel compelled to replace everything with a blasted touch screen?  Just give me a few round knobs and some simple buttons and I will be happy.  Needless to say, I am happy in the Altima.

Styling-wise, I really like the way this car looks.  It's got a little flair (something severely lacking in this segment) and it stands out in a crowd.  The taillamps are a nice treatment here.  On many cars with the aftermarket "Altezza" lights (as they're called) the treatment looks horrid.  Here, they look just about right.  The design of the back end also allows for easy access to the trunk, which is, to put it lightly, huge.  I don't know the exact measurements, but there's a lot of space in there for whatever stuff you feel the need to stuff in there.

So the verdict?  In my honest opinion, I think Nissan has a good, solid vehicle on their hands with this new Altima.  Now that it's finally a legit contender to the Accord and Camry, I think you'll be seeing a lot more of these on the road.

If for some reason the Altima doesn't tickle your fancy, there are more alternatives to consider than one could shake the proverbial stick at.  There is, of course, the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, the current class leaders.  There's also the Chevy Impala, Ford Taurus, Dodge Intrepid and Stratus, and the upcoming Mazda 6 (the 6 is a 2003 model set to debut soon)
