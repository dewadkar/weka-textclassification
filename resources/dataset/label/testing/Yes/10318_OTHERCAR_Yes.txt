            I was very pleasantly surprised by all the space and amenities of the Altima compared to the rather sanitized look of Honda and Toyota. Jerry Hirschberg, the Altima's designer at Nissan, knows how to give a family car sex appeal, and he did it well with the Altima. She gets lots of comments from family and friends. Her flawless deep maroon paint has held up amazingly well over the years - far better than the paint on most American vehicles of the same age.

The value is where it's at. The Altima is a four-door, 4-cylinder, 150 horsepower people mover that does exaclty what the cookie-cutter Honda Accord does but with more curves and a hotter engine. You don't even really need the manual tranny to get decent performance out of it. My '95 has airbags, but no ABS. I'd like the ABS, but I will have to buy the new model to get it. I will too.

I should mention I bought this car as a rental return with 30,000 miles on it. The test ride was the deciding factor; The car is quiet and solid, so much so that road surface "feedback" was a little vague. But this is a passenger vehicle, not a rally car so I won't fault it. Have I found ANYTHING wrong with it yet? No. Nothing. Drives like new with 90,000 miles on it.

Passing gear is tremendous in this car. You will actually walk away from V6 cars once you're at about 4 grand, or 60 mph. Dump the throttle and listen to the roar of those 16 valves. Once in the powerband (which ambushes you in a very immediate fashion you can't ignore) you can really use this thing. This car is no quitter. Handles a little loose in the corners at speed with nominal understeer in the front, but if you move up to a Michelin Pilot Series tires the understeer and "plow" is diminished greatly. Predicatble but not amazing brakes, and extremely quiet and composed interior on the highway.

I'm 6'2" and 200lbs. and I fit easily in the front or back. Ample headroom and legroom all around. The fake walnut trim on the dash adds a touch of luxury, shifting is smooth and progressive, and the instruments and other controls fall to hand and eye easily.

Wife says she can't "find the corners" in parking lots because of the dropoff of the body panels. Can't argue with her, but I have no problem with it because of my height. Overall this is a safe, reliable choice that you will be glad you made. I'm going to get the new one next.
