            I just brought a Sante Fe about 6 months ago and I am impressed by a lot of features about it: 

1) A very smooth and quiet ride. The suspension system is great and the noise level from outside is very low while you are driving, when the windows are up. It handles the road very well. It gets through the snow well but don't expect it to handle like the bigger utility vehicles. It can handle  a little more snow than the average car. It does have a 4 wheel drive system.

2) Very Roomy. You can fold down back seats and have plenty of storage space in the trunk. It sits about 5 people comfortably. Plenty of cup holders for the drive in or long trips.

3) A Nice Sound System. The CD player, radio and speaker system are great. Good quality sound.

4)Good price and a great warranty. It prices below $20,000 and came with a 100,000 mile warranty.

5) Good looking body style will get you noticed on the road. It also has luggage carrying straps on top of vehicle. It is about average on gas consumption.

All in all a great deal  for the bargain conscious consumer in my opinion.
