            This is a great car to cruise around in.  They are available with the 4 cylinder engine which is underpowered.  It only supplies 21 to 27 mpg.  On average I get 23 mpg.  I love the design but the location of the controls can be better.  The power windows are located on the dash above the radio and climate controls.  Hard to locate if you are not used to this vehicle.

The limited has a side airbag, leather seats, 6 speaker cd changer, and keyless entry and security system.  A computer console is located in the roof that displays temperatures and other info for the driver.  There is a removable rear seat and a shelf in the back. 

The ride is very quiet with no body roll in the crisp turning.  Engine noise is minimal except for harder acceleration and high speeds (above 70) on the highway.

There are a number of colors to choose from and the price is more than reasonable.  It can range from a high 15k to mid 18k fully loaded with all the bells and whistles!
