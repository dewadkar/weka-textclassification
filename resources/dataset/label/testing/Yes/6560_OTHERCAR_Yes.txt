            We were in the market for a big truck, like a Suburban but unfortunately our wallet wasn't in the same market! We were both put off at first on buying a minivan because we still consider ourselves pretty young. But after seeing this van and test driving it around we've been pretty happy!! We have 3 kids, 2 car seats and a Great Dane. So we needed lots of room!!! This van offered the room and comfort with out the price tag. The double doors with keyless entry are such a comfort. We have a Grand Caravan that has more &quot;trunk&quot; space. We easily fit a double stroller and a friends stroller plus our shopping bags!!!  Our dog is 160lbs and is 6'4&quot; when he stands on his hind legs and he can easily sit, stand and turn around in the back. So far so good with us!<br><br>
