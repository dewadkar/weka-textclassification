            I was in need of a new toy. Something new to focus on.
My thought was a new car since it's something I deal
with daily. Can't get to work without it.

I was looking for something sportier than the 1999 GrandAm
that I was driving. I had no problems with the GrandAm, 
only had 19,000 miles on it but it was time for a change. 
I needed to be stimulated behind the wheel. Thoughts of my
old 1967 GTO rattled in my brain. Are there any true,
throwback type muscle cars out there that I could afford ?
Something with a <b>"kick"</b> and a little class ?

I researched so many new cars (especially at the website
most car buffs know - www.edmunds.com) that my brain
was starting to fog up. I finally narrowed it down to 
three.

All 2002's, the Mustang, the Camaro and the Firebird.

Obviously, since I'm writing under this heading I chose 
the Firebird. Believe me, there wasn't a whole lot of
difference between the 3. Prices are very similar, 
engines, options and performance are all fairly equal.

My choice was based on two main items. First, 
availability with the color and options I desired and
secondly, was the offer that was made to me.

I chose a Navy Blue Metallic, 3.8 Litre, V6. My choice
was based on the fact that a V8, here in the Miami 
area is useless. You go 5 mph in rush hour, 5 days
a week, so it really doesn't matter if you have 1000
horsepower or 200 like the V6 has. It still has plenty
of get up and go when you do have that rare opportunity
to use it!

The options I chose were as follows:

1SB package which includes automatic transmission,
6 way power driver seat, Theft deterrent system, and
a massive 10 speaker, 500watt  Monsoon stereo/CD player
with graphic equalizer. It is LOUD but the sound
quality is excellent! <b> Cost: $1,755.00 </b>

I also chose the performance package which consists
of dual exhausts, touring tires and limited slip rear
differential. <b> Cost: $355.00 </b>

Traction control for those heavy rain days, flooded 
highways and pitted roads here in sunny Florida.
<b>Cost: $250.00</b>

The base price of this model was $19,515.00 plus
$575.00 destination charge which brought the
invoice value of this car to $20,090.00.
Then you add tax, registration, license which
came to an additional $1,400 for a bottom line
of <b>$21,490.00</b>. Then tack on the $2,360.00
for the selected options and that comes to $23,850.00

After some negotiating, I finally agreed and paid
$20,000.00 including the rebate (see below).

Pontiac also has a low financing option or $1,000 cash
rebate. I chose the rebate simply based on my personal
situation. Most would probably be better off taking the
financing discount.

O.K. we've covered the options I chose , now a list 
of the standard features which are plentiful:

<b>Dual front airbags
Carbon Shocks
4-wheel Anti-lock brakes with 4wheel power disc brakes
Pass key theft deterrent system
Concealed Halogen headlamps
Fog lamps
DRL (Daytime running lights)
Integral rear deck spoiler
Dual sport mirrors
Power antenna
Air conditioning
Reclining Front bucket seats
Fold down rear seat
All kinds of bells and whistles (tachometer etc)
Power windows and door locks
Controlled cycle wipers
Cruise control
Electric rear window defogger
Tilt steering wheel
Front and rear floor mats</b>

There is nothing special about the Pontiac 
warranty. Standard 3 year/36,000 mile deal.

Performance and handling on this model are excellent.
It has plenty of punch for a V6 and the styling is
a real head turner. Low, wide and sleek. At the
price of this vehicle, I don't think you can go
wrong. There are cheaper imports out there but
this total package blows them all away.

I also like the fact that 85% of the parts are
made in the U.S. and Canada. The final assembly
point for the car is in Ste. Therese, Canada.

My only problem is that now, I have to lose some
weight and do stretching exercises so I can get in 
and out gracefully ! It is low to ground but fairly comfortable as long as you stay in the front ! The rear seating (bucket seats) will accomodate two butts 
of small to extra-small size. No normal sizes will fit comfortably. Thank God I'm a mature (old ?) adult and 
won't have to spend any time in the back seat - LOL !

All-in-all, price-wise, options offered, drivability 
and styling, I would recommend this model to anyone who wants to add a little "pizzazz" to their driving habits.

<b>I love my new toy !</b>
