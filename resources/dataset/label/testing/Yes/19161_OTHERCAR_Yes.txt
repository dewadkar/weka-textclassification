            The VW Passat is a great car in many ways - it is clean-looking, has good power (has the same engine as the Audi A4), it is perfect for a young single professional (like myself), and it is sufficiently roomy as a family car. My girlfriend's brother just bought one, and he has two kids ages 3 and 5. I didn't buy any of the options, like the V6, sunroof, leather interior or 6-CD changer, but you don't really need them. It comes equipped with power everything, alarm, etc. You should test drive one and check out all the funky extras - you may hate how the dashboard lights up in neon purple and red at night, or how the key costs $300 to replace. I don't - I plan to keep this car over 7-10 years. However, in the first 2,500 miles I have driven the car, a strange clicking has developed in the steering wheel. I took it to the dealer where I bought it, they checked it out and found nothing. I've got my fingers crossed, and the clicking comes and goes. However, I have read about a few new Passat lemons through deja.com, and I hope mine isn't one of them. The worst story I heard was about a guy who has replaced the transmission twice in the first 6 weeks he has owned the car. But so far, no serious problems. I will say the defrost is shockingly bad. My German friend tells me these are the hottest cars right now in Europe - everyone in Spain wants one.<br><br>
