            For years I had heard about the benefits of owning a Toyota Corolla, a car that could last a lifetime if properly maintained.  My daughters had owned them and couldn't say enough about how great they were.  Never having owned a Toyota before I took their word for it, but still kept driving a Ford Taurus.  When I moved to Florida a few years ago all that changed.(NOTE:  I use WebTV and cannot paragraph so I use dots.).........................................................................................................................The lease on my beautiful metallic saddle tan Taurus expired just prior to my moving to Florida.  The purchase price was more than I wanted to get into so I decided to purchase my daughter's 1997 Toyota Corolla.  She had been using it on a lease deal through her company.  Since it was a company car I was able to drive it for two years without any payments until the lease expired.  In return I helped out at her business.  I learned to love the car and felt buying it would be the right thing to do. ..........................................................................................................................I'm not good at remembering numbers, but it seems to me that when the lease was up I bought it for something like eight or nine thousand.  Not cash mind you, don't I wish.  I'm making payments like most other folks.  But when it's paid off it'll be mine and will hopefully give me many more years of service.  I like the maneuverability of the Toyota Corolla.  It's big enough to make you feel safe, and yet small enough to easily fit into parking spaces.  Mine is one of those dark green shades.  I'm too lazy to go out to the car and check out the official title, but you know the color I'm talking about.  It's a four-door, which I also like because sometimes I need to install a car seat for one of my younger grandchildren. ..........................................................................................................................I wish it had remote controlled door locks, but I can live without that feature.  I often drive to Sarasota, which is about an hour and a half from Fort Myers, where I live.  The trip is always pleasant.  I can easily stay at 70 or 75 mph on the Interstate without feeling like I'm going to leave the road.  I feel like I am in control and have confidence that my Toyota will get me there safe.  Mine isn't loaded with all the bells and whistles, but I do have a tape deck (wish it were CD) so I can listen to Elvis, or Pavorotti, or Bocelli, or Neil Diamond, or Edith Piaf, or whomever else I'm in the mood for. .........................................................................................................................My car is roomy enough for me and I rarely have more than one other person in the car with me so my passenger is also comfortable.  If I have to get three or four in the car, those in the back seat won't have as much leg room as they'd like, but as long as it's not a long-distance trip it doesn't really matter much.  I like the way the car handles on the road and in town.  I wish it had another setting on the windshield wipers.  It has two settings, one fast, one medium...I'd like a slower one for the light rain that often frequents S.W. Florida.  The trunk is also very roomy.  Since I use it for storage space, that is much appreciated.  When I pick up a friend or family member at the airport the luggage goes in the back seat.  There's no room at the inn in my trunk. ..........................................................................................................................What I like best about my Toyota Corolla is that I have not had much maintenance.  I had to put two new tires on it a year ago and a new battery was needed about six months ago, but outside of that it runs like a top.  One of my sons-in-law says it could use an oil change, so that's on my priority list.  They always say, keep the oil changed and your car will love you for it.  Right now, my car has never been cleaner.  One of my daughters scrubbed it outside and inside for me, a payback for frosting her hair. She said she's going to give me a detail job as a Xmas present.  Isn't that a novel gift?  This guy comes to your home and details your car.  I have a few swirly marks that need to be taken care of so I look forward to that visit...........................................................................................................................Years ago someone came up with the expression &quot;Never Buy a Ford.&quot;  I wouldn't go that far because I did love my Ford Taurus, but no more than I like my Toyota Corolla.  It's a great car for economy, looks, maneuverability, and comfort.    <br><br>
