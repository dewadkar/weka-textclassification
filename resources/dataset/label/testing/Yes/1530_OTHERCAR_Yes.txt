            I bought my SL2 Saturn as my first car. I love it! i enjoy driving it, it is comfortable and rides nice. It is definitely worth it for the money. I would buy another one all over again. Even buying the car was fun! Everything that is positive that is said about the Saturn buying experience is true. They were friendly and nice and knew their stats. If you are looking for a first car or a economical car, then this is it! The one thing that I disklike is the loudness of the engine, but if I wanted quiet, I would have bought a BMW. I recommend his car to anyone looking for a good deal and a great car!<br><br>
