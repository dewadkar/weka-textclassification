            I bought a Mavica 83 some time ago and my only regret is sticking with the old film format for so long.  I find the 3.5 floppy to be the best feature you can find in a camera! You dont have to take up a serial port for connecting it, and it can be used on ANY computer, just snap a pic and slap the disk into a computer.  It saves in .jpg file format, the most common format for pictures.  This camera is just incredibly easy to transfer pictures from. One disadvantage of the floppy format is its not incredibly slow, so if you hope to take fast pictures, get a compact-flash based camera.

The resolution is very good, but not quite as good as comparably priced units. You pay for the different format, but its worth it.  It has a nice clear 2.5 inch LCD display with a backlight for displaying your pictures, which is a must for a digital camera. This camera also has some fun picture modes including Black&amp;White, Sepia, Solarize, Negative, etc..

Another great feature is the ability to take short mpeg videos. They are not great quality but they're great for e-mailing to family. At Christmas, I made an mpeg of each picture my grandson opened, and e-mailed them around the family when I got home! The direct picture can also be output in NTSC format for viewing pictures on a TV or recording to a VCR just like a tethered camcorder. This feature would also be GREAT for putting up a presentation of pictures of a future project or something.

Overall, this is a great camera for family, professionals, or even casual sightseeing.<br><br>
