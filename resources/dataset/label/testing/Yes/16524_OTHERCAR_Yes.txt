            I chose to buy this vehicle because I previously owned 2 VW rabbits, and loved both of them. Although they had their issues...but that's a different story. I thought a new VW would have the power I wanted, the options I wanted, and a Price I could afford.  And all three of those were true.

The price of the car is very good for what the car offers. The options included in the basic car are very good, CD player, Moon roof, Power everything, A/C..the list goes on.  

The power of the car is very good, especially in the VR6 model... I am not sure of HP and those things but when I need to merge on the freeway, I can get there no problem. 

Storage space in a car this size is unbeleiveable...the trunk is HUGE..

One thing I have noticed, is that when something goes wrong, ie a sensor is broken, you muct take it to the dealer and get it fixed their... and their rates are very high... but this is another review.

Overall I would recommend this car to everyone.

*****UPDATE MAY 8 ******

Ok, well a few things have changed, although I still recommend this car.  It seems that sometimes somethings can happen without any warning at all.  example: This weekend, I was driving around, I stopped the car, turned it off and when I got back in to start it, the alarm started going off... which was odd... AND it completely disabled the motor, which is a good sign.  So I called roadside assistance to see what the deal was, and they said the alarm needs to be reset.  She told me how very simply and I tried it.  It did not work.  So I had to call again and get a tow truck.  I will spare you the details but it turns out this happens quite often to VW's, and I also assume, all cars with alarms... but this turned out to only be a drained battery... very inconvienient...

but I still love the car

***** UPDATE 02/28/01 *****

We sold the Jetta because we were leasing it and some problems started to happen, the molding fell off the car, engine was knocking...some other things but it was a while ago.  now we bought a 2000 VW Golf Turbo, a very nice car.  I will soon post my review on it, since we've had it for about 5 months now...

**** END UPDATE ****
