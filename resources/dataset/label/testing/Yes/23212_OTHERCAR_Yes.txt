            Since I am becoming a more responsible, upstanding young man of the world...(finally, at 25).....I decided that I was going to make the ultimate informed, can't go wrong, gonna get all the quality-bang-for-my-buck digital camera purchase decision.  And, (breaks arm patting myself on back) I believe I have accomplished my goal.  :)

I was completely digital camera illiterate when I wandered into Best Buy.  (What's a Megapixel?)  Luckily, I had a friend who worked there who is a total electronic junkie and he set me on the straight and narrow.  I wanted to stick to a name brand camera, with an easy to use interface, a good, large number Megapixel, and as inexpensive as possible.  

I researched more, realized that for the price no other digital camera came close to offering 2.2 Megapixels.  So, after much pondering, I brought the DX3500 home with me and hoped we would hit it off.  It was love at first click.  We have been inseparable ever since.  Here is a quick rundown of my new mate's best and worst features:

Best:
1)  The price.  (I love bargains)
2)  The quality of the photos it takes.  (The first time I transferred a picture from the DX3500 and saw it full blown, full color on my computer, I think I had to wipe up the drool from the keyboard.)
3)  The ease of using it.  (I am notorious for not reading instructions...to my rare surprise, I barely had to.  The camera basically teaches you itself.)
4)  The weight.  (It makes my old camera look like a barbell.)
5)  The software that accompanies the camera is very easy to install and to use.  With a few simple clicks you have the photos zapped from the camera to your system.


Sadly, nothing in life is perfect.  There are a couple of things (mainly small stuff) I would change about my new camera.

The Bad Stuff:
1)  Battery Drainage.  The batteries that came with the camera were kaput in about three weeks.  I used my camera quite a bit during that time frame, but not enough that it should have drained my batteries to zero.  
2)  Flimsy strap.  While on vacation, I noticed that the strap was so slippery and flimsy I was afraid it was going to slide off my arm or break.  (So I found a new use for an old shoestring.)
3)  I find the LED screen hard to see and not very indicative of the picture that it takes.  From what I have noticed, when I take pictures using the LED as my vantage point, the picture doesn't turn out with the same parameters as it should.  Perhaps this is my fault being a novice, but I revert to the old peep through the viewfinder routine.
4)  When I zoomed in on something, even a small bit, I experienced quite a bit of fuzziness on the photo.  It was also rather tricky figuring out how to zoom the camera.


On the whole tho, I could not be happier with my purchase.  My friends are already tired of it ("Are you bringing that thing with us AGAIN?")  but I am happy as a lark, and I think that this camera would satisfy everyone from a beginning photographer to a seasoned pro.
