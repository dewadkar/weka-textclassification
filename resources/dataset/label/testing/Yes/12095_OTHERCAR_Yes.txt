            We bought our Suzuki Grand Vitara because we had had so much fun with the little Suzuki jeep convertible that we had bought second hand.  That little vehicle had been driven all the way to South America and had over 250,000 miles on it.  It was still in great shape.  It was a little small and I didn't like the way it handled when you went around corners.  So we decided to get a larger Suzuki.  We have been very happy with it. It is a V6 but it gets better gas mileage than my 4 cylinder Dodge Spirit did.  It is very comfortable and handles very well on the highway and on dirt roads.  The heater works well.  It warms up quickly.  Sometimes it gets moisture on the inside of the windows as the defrost does not always work as well as it should.  I have had to get used to all of the blind spots in this vehicle.  There are head rests on the front and back seats which block your vision and the solid portion of the vehicle around the windows gets in your way.  It is a classy looking vehicle.  We got the special front and back bumper kit and the running boards.  We had it all painted gold.  I get many stares and questions about what kind of vehicle I am driving.  We looked around before buying the Grand Vitara at other sports utility vehicles.  The Grand Vitara was the most reasonable priced vehicle. I think it is a lot of vehicle for the money. <br><br>
