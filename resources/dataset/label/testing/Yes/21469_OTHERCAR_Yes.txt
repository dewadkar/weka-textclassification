            One of the vehicles we used at the TV station I worked at, on a daily basis was the Suzuki XL7. If I could say one thing about this SUV, is that, it&#146s generic. It&#146s not going to win any points for it&#146s styling, interior or exterior.You can read my review about the <a href="/content_117394476676">2003 Chevrolet Tracker</a>, and I only mention it because GM and Suzuki did a type of joint venture to design the Chevy Tracker and  Suzuki Grand Vitara, and the XL7 is frighteningly similar. The only difference about the XL7 is that it has 3rd row seating and a wishbone suspension. Now, let me just say something about the 3rd row seats. They&#146re useless. Putting 3rd row seats in a compact SUV, was quite possibly the worst idea I&#146ve seen in a vehicle. The whole time we used this vehicle, we never even raised the rear seats, they were kept folded down to load equipment. One time when we were cleaning it, we raised them and I tried to get back there, and unless you are a toddler, good luck. I can&#146t even imagine riding back there for the shortest of trips. And about the wishbone suspension. I drove the XL7 quite often, to all corners of the state. I didn&#146t notice any smoother of a ride than my sisters Tracker. The engine peppiness seemed a little more sluggish than the Tracker, but it really held it&#146s ground when traveling 60-70MPH, unlike the Tracker which would shimmy and shake. This may just be because it was a longer SUV, or maybe it had something to do with the wishbone suspension. Almost every other aspect of this vehicle was similar to the Tracker. I'm sure that Suzuki added all kinds of minor refinements too it, but they only mean something to me if I used or noticed them. Even in the Limited model we had, all i could think about when i was driving it was, this is a Chevy Tracker.
  
     One of the good factors is the field of view. The whole top half of the vehicle is windows...so it's bright and airy, and I didn't encounter any blind spots. The defroster is terrible. It would clear little patches of condensation off the windows, leaving visibility to a minimum. The tailgate opens like a door, on a hinge, and doesn't drop down, which is a poor design element, especially in tight parking lots when you're loading and unloading, and you get trapped.

     I had the pleasure on several occasions to drive the XL7 on slushy roads. Even when the 4WD is on...the SUV slips and slides, and has no connection to the ground. It was a frightening experience. Combine that with the shoddy defroster...and you have yourself a winter nightmare on wheels. The gas mileage was mediocre, maybe 20 MPG tops. The engine itself wasn't particularly noisy, but the bad aerodynamic design of the vehicle gives you a LOT of wind noise.
