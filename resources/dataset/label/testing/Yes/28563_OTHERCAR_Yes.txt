            If you are looking for a true 4-wheel drive vehicle, this is the one you need to get.  I have had mine for 6 months and have never been happier with a car, it is a true SUV in every sense.  The 4.0 liter in-line 6 has more than enough power to get you over a fallen tree or past a slow driver.  The narrow wheelbase makes it virtually impossible to get stuck (and believe me, I have tried), and the ground clearance will get you over objects that would high-center almost any other vehicle on the road.

However, this is not a car for everyone.  While it is unparalleled off-road, it can be a bit on the road.  It is loud, handling leaves a lot to be desired, you can't fit more than your dog in the back seats, and you will be lucky to get 20 mpg.

The 2000 version has a number of improvements that add those extra creature comforts.  The bucket seats were still comfortable after a 1000 mile trip on highways and off-road.  If you have ever been in an older Jeep, you will appreciate the fact that the climate controls actually work.  And, having a sound bar, I can actually hear the music with the top down on the highway.  All of this for under $21k, you will have troubles finding a better deal.
