            This was my first digital camera.  I've had it for 4 months now and I have to agree with most A40 owners here who really love this camera for its features, picture quality, and offering both ease-of-use and many creative possibilities with manual settings, effects, panoramic mode, rapid-fire shooting, etc.

Since the time I bought it (July/02), the price has gone down by about 20% so it's even a better deal now!

I won't talk about the major pros/cons of this camera that others have covered better than I can, but I'll add a few personal thoughts.  

<b>Pluses</b>
I believe that the Compact Flash storage is a major plus - this is a cheap and well-supported format, and the cards are robust.  You can now get them in sizes up to 2.0 GB, which would store about 3200 A40 shots in fine-highres mode.  This may seem like a ridiculous amount, but if you're on vacation for an extended period of time and you have the freedom to capture photos of anything that interests you, plus take small video clips, you could actually use it up.  Also, I've found the camera to be very handy as a "portable photocopier" - for capturing information from forms, flyers, the writing on museum plaques, etc. so the shots quickly add up.  Probably it's more manageable (and cost effective) to get a bunch of 128 MB cards, or even find a store that will burn your CF card on a CD-rom so that you can erase it, but at least the possibility to go bigger is there and costs will come down.  Meanwhile, Sony's memory sticks seem to be stuck at 128 Megs. (Note - added Mar 3/03. Sony now has higher capacity sticks called the Memory Stick Pro, which are offered by multiple suppliers and store up to 1 Gig, so as usual nothing stays put.  However, the new sticks won't work on older Sony cameras except for the F717.)

The accessories for the A40 are potentially significant - not every model offers a waterproof housing.  This is great option for protecting the camera in harsh environments as well as doing underwater shooting.  I haven't done this yet but I plan to get one soon.

I was on vacation in Italy and I quickly found how useful the panoramic (stitch-assist) mode was.  Sometimes the result of stitching multiple photos together is a little distorted, but it nonetheless allows you to get an impression of a wide area that you simply would not be able to do any other way (photographically that is). So, I find myself doing them quite often.  Being greedy and wanting more, I would like to see the ability to stitch photos in both directions (i.e. vertically and horizontally) at once.


<b>Minuses</b>
You can't beat the A40 for what you get for the money; however, now that I've had some experience with it, and know a little more about digital photography, I know what I'd like to see improved.

I believe that the A40 is really not that suitable for indoor shooting. If you're using the flash, it's not very strong, so things/people in the foreground are really bright and the background is dim.  I've seen similarly-taken shots from other cameras (including my cheap automatic film camera) which are much more evenly lit. 

If you attempt to not use the flash, the A40's lens doesn't really let in enough light and the shutter has to stay open for a relatively long time.  So unless you've got really steady hands, and your subjects don't move at all, it's really easy to get blurry shots.  You can try to compensate by using a higher ISO value and thus speeding up the shutter, but I personally don't like the extra noise that shows up on these photos.  My friend has a Sony 707 (a 5 Megapix camera whose price is 2-3 times the A40's, and it's a huge beast with a big bulky lens, so it's an unfair comparison) and you can really see the difference in the clarify of non-flash indoor shots, even at the same resolution.  The main difference I believe is the speed of the lens - the A40's best aperture ranges from 2.8 - 4.8, while the Sony's ranges from 2.0 - 2.4. While I'm more than happy with the quality of outdoor/well lit shots, if you're truly serious about indoor shots, then A40 is only just OK and there are other packages better suited for this. Anyone out there agree/disagree with this?   (Note: added Sept 6/03.  I've now come to the conclusion that for indoor shooting, the best practical solution is still to use a small automatic FILM camera.  The weakness in consumer digital cams is actually the sensor - they are currently too small and insensitive to provide noise-free shots in poor lighting conditions.  With a film camera, if you want to upgrade the quality of your sensor, you simply buy faster better quality film; have your prints output to a CD or scan the negatives if you want digital copies.  If you want to stay completely digital, you'll have to use a big expensive (circa $1000, though dropping) heavy SLR-type camera to get equivalent results, and both the size and cost may cramp your style.  Examples of such cameras would be the new Canon EOS 300D, or maybe the Sony F828. Sorry for omitting other brands; these are all I know)

It's been mentioned many times the general problem of digital cameras to focus in low-lighting conditions.  The A40 is no exception and I've been extremely frustrated at times trying to get the darned thing to focus!  It's very important to use the A40's focusing modes (macro, portrait, infinity) to restrict the focusing range to what you require, so that if there are focus problems at least you won't be too far off.  Also, the A40 lets you lock the focus, so you can focus on a well-lit object that is the same distance from you as your intended subject, lock the focus, and then shoot at your intended subject.  So, there are workarounds to the focusing problem that you may be able to make use of if you have the time.

While the 3x zoom is better than what most cameras offer, it is possible to get a camera with a better zoom without having to screw in another lens.  I'm now looking at the new Olympus C-730UZ - the "ultra-zoom" with a 10x optical zoom on a fairly compact body. Again, this camera costs at least twice as much as the A40, but you need to consider how important a good zoom is to you.  I have found several occasions where a better zoom would have been really nice.  At the other extreme, a better ability to shoot close-ups would also be nice - a cheap and goofy workaround is to put a magnifying glass infront of your A40, which will allow it to effectively focus on closer objects.  The other alternative is to buy the optional close-up and telephoto lenses that are available for this camera.

The manual mode is something that you simply don't get with most other cameras in this range, but I should point out that there are only 2 aperture settings available! This was a bit of a shock to me. The range of shutter speeds is however, very wide and fine grained (from 15s to 1/1500s), so I've gotten to live with it.  Also, the noise reduction that the camera performs on long exposures is a pretty high-end feature.

By the way (a bit off topic), if you're new to digital, make sure you get into the habit of backing up your data - I had a scare with a flaky disk that temporarily died holding some precious photos which I thought were lost forever.  Fortunately it came back to life after being refrigerated overnight (beware of the Fujitsu MPG series drives - it's well documented on the net). Now that I've learned my lesson, I've created multiple copies of all my images in different formats (i.e. CD-ROMs, my website, and considering the ultra-reliable magneto-optical disks).

<b>Overall</b>
I've mentioned more negatives that positives, but that's not my overall impression of the camera. In fact, it's quite the opposite. But, it's not perfect and one should possibly consider moving up, depending on what kind of photography that one is into.  Would I personally buy this camera again knowing what I know now?  Probably,  especially at today's prices. Actually, when I think of the money saved on film and development, the cost of the camera is relatively insignificant.  Still money is finite and the A40 is the best combination of a compact package, good price, and a ton of useful features (again look at the other reviews for a better description of the features).  This was my first experience with Canon and I've really come to like this company and its products.  At the same time - and partly because of what this camera has taught me about photography - I can't wait to see how this camera evolves as I know that I will want a better one someday. Those of you who like the A40 because of all of its features, may also be the type who ends up looking for slightly more - especially having a better zoom and better performance under non-ideal lighting would make the A40 much more useful for me.

Note (added Mar 3/03):  Canon has recently announced the A40's successor - the A60, which on paper seems to address a lot of A40 grievances mentioned by other reviewers - better navigation, better macro, more control (focus, aperture priority, shutter priority, custom white balance), longer video recordings, voice annotation ability and 
an orientation sensor.  It also has a new processing brain, which promises faster focusing ability, and possibly (I'm guessing here) better battery life.  However, the lens and sensor seem basically the same, so whether it can actually produce better pictures than the A40 remains to be seen by the first who get their hands on an A60.  If it doesn't take better non-ideal lighting pictures, then I think the A40 could still provide the best value for money as they try to clear out the stock of A40s at bargain prices to make way for the A60.  I'll be watching the developments with great interest...  Another new offering from Canon is the A70, very similar to the A60 but is a 3.2 Mpixel camera that can take VGA resolution video clips - very interesting!
