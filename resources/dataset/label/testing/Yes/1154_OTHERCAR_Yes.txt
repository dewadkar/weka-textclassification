            I previously owned a 1999 Dakota R/T which I had many problems with.  Having traded a Neon which I loved for the R/T, I decided I should check out the 2000 ES.  
I absolutely love driving my Neon ES.  It corners wonderfully and accelerates a lot better than most people expect.  The ride is smooth and very quiet compared to the previous generation and many of the problems plaguing the 95-99 models have been corrected.  In order to truly appreciate the Neon, you must drive it.  
A couple issues I have are the sunroof creaks and the passenger seat has a loose hogring that vibrates at idle.  After 8000 miles I have had no other problems besides those and absolutely love the car.  
Anyone that is looking for a fun small car to drive should consider the Neon strongly.  It is quicker and more nimble than cars much more expensive and the aftermarket industry is still growing tremendously for the Neon.  <br><br>
