            My best friend took possession of a new S2000 about a month ago, having been on the waiting list for one for nearly a year.  By some miracle, he actually got it at MSRP (this was stipulated in the contract he signed to reserve one, before the dealer clued in that the car would be an incredibly hot ticket), but the dealer is now charging an $8,000 markup on others that have arrived.  I'm in the market for a new roadster myself, and I've already evaluated the BMW M Roadster and the Porsche Boxster, so my friend has let me drive it a bit.

Biggest impression: the analogy of this car being &quot;a motorcycle on four wheels&quot; is totally apt.  Good GOD does this thing scream over 6000 rpm!  I used to own an Acura Integra GSR, which also has a VTEC engine, but the S2000 blows it away by a country mile.  On the downside, it's severely lacking in torque, a *big* problem in city-driving situations.  The M Roadster blows the doors off the S2000 below 5000 rpm.

The handling is what you'd probably expect: absolutely mind-blowing.  I hate using the term &quot;surgically precise&quot; due to its overuse in the major car magazines, but that's an accurate description.  Still, I think I prefer the handling of the Boxster; it has more of an edge.  Which leads to my big complaint about this car, as well as every other Honda I've driven: it simply has no soul.  Everything is just *too* perfect, and even Honda's attempts to give the car some interesting &quot;quirks&quot; (e.g. the red push-button starter) seem pretty phony.  OTOH, this car has the lightest, niftiest shifter I've ever experienced, though I'd worry about how hot a titanium shift knob will get in the summer here in Texas.

Inside, it's pretty cramped.  Not Miata-level cramped, but tight nonetheless.  But, that's par for the course for a two-seat roadster, I'm sure (though the BMW and Boxster both seem more airy).  OTOH it has lots of useful storage bins.

Overall, if you don't have a problem with impracticality and want a roadster that's not too taxing to drive in rush-hour traffic, the S2000 is a can't-miss bet.<br><br>
