            The <b>POLAROID PhotoMAX PDC640 Digital Camera</b> is a <i>GREAT</i> camera.

I just recently obtained one and would like to share some information on it with you.  

<i>It comes with the following accessories when purchased:</i>

* Camera case
* Polaroid PhotMAX Image maker products CD-rom
* AA Batteries
* Camera-to-TV Connector (Video Cable)
* 2mg memory card
* Camera-to-computer connector (RS232 serial cable)
* AC power Adapter
* PDC640 Digital Camera
* Wrist Strap

<i>Here are some features of the camera</i>

* Self-timer LED
* Optical viewfinder
* Built in Flash
* Sliding Lens Cover
* 3 Distance settings (normal, close range and distant)
* Tripod socket
* Battery status indicator
* Lock mode to prevent accidental deletion of photos
* 4 different resolution settings
  * 640X480 super-high resolution (stores up to 12 images)
 
  * 640x480 high resolution (stores up to 24 images)
  
  * 640x480 standard resolution (stores up to 36 images)
   
  * 320x240 stores up to 96 images

There are 4 different flash settings as well.  Auto, flash on, no flash, and flash with red eye prevention.

This camera has a lot to offer in it's class.  It is very simple to use and takes great pictures.

It offers a serial hookup connection to your pc or if no pc you can use the video cable and store them on a video tape.

I wish that it offered a optional USB hookup, but this can always be solved by purchasing a serial to USB converter.
