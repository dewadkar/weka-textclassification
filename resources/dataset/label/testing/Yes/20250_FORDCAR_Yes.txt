            Ford Broncos never appealed to me before.  I just didn't see anything in them that I would like or need.  My husband, however, loved the feeling of climbing a steep hill, or going to the mountains through the snow or going to the beach and just driving in the sand.  Well he got his wish in 1997, we went out and bought a 1990 Eddie Bauer Bronco.  As old as this bronco is, it has never given us any problems.  It's a 4 wheel drive, cruise control, tinted windows with power locks and doors.  We go everywhere in it the snow, the ice, the sand, without having to worry about getting &quot;stuck.&quot;  It now has over 150,000 miles and is still doing great, has a beautiful paint job and looks like it was a 2,000 model.  So for anyone wanting to purchase a bronco, I would say &quot;go for it.&quot;

And I didn't even like Bronco's before.<br><br>
