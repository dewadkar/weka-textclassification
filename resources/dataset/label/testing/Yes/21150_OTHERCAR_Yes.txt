            I bought a Cybershot DSC-S50 a few months before finding a deal on this model, and quite honestly I feel both have their strong and weak points. (See my review of the DSC-S50 on Epinions as well).

First off, the <b>zoom lens and picture quality are great</b>. There's no doubt about it. The manual focus option is rarely seen in digital cameras, as well as the amount of focusing modes. The display is clean and can be turned off to save power on the battery. And stylistically, the camera is one product that could be shown in design museums.

But, there are downsides. This camera is best for photographers and possibly studio work. The size of the camera is not easily transportable like the DSC-s50. The <b>lack of viewfinder</b> might be a problem when manually focusing, since you have to rely on the lcd screen. Also, charging the battery can only be done out of the camera (most other Cybershots just need an adapter plugged in).

For general design and photo uses, this camera is great. Specific features and <b>design of the camera make it less desired for the family gatherings and quick takes on vacation</b>.
