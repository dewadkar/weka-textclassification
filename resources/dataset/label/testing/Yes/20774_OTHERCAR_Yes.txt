                    I have had pretty much no problems with this camera. The only thing that I do not like about this camera is it takes the photos to slow. Besides that it is great.
        For starters the camera is pretty small so it is easy to take places and it fits about anywhere. It is silver in color. It has a blue strip on the top of the camera. I purchased the camera at Best Buy. 
        Mine came with two batteries and a battery charger. It did not come with a case. That would have been nice but you cannot have everything. Of course all the wires to connect it to your computer.The battery life you can get up to 3000 shots and up to 2.5 hours. It also comes with a memory card. The memory card can store about 50 email quality pictures or maybe even more I am not totally sure about that but I know it is at least 50 if not more. It can store 13 normal size pictures. It cannot store them at the same time. It is either one or the other.
        Some of the features are it is 2.0 Mega Pixels. The zoom is 3 times the precision digital. It has MPEG Movie HQX with no sound. In English that is more understandable. It can make a short movie with no sound. I thought that was pretty good. The only bad thing was that I would have liked to send it through an email for my parents to see but it was to big of a file.
         The reason I decided to get this camera is that me and my husband moved away from our families and we just had a baby. This way we could send them pictures through the computer so they could see how she is growing.
         It is a pretty self explanatory camera. You can use it pretty easy. You just turn a nob on the back to do different things. One feature of using the nob on the back is you turn to SCN and are able to scan all the pictures you took. Another feature is you can delete a picture right on the camera if it was not what you expected. To zoom in and out with the camera there is a little button on the back you can push. To either zoom in or out. There are two little circle buttons in the back of the camera which can be used to show the menu (it says menu right over it) and a display button and it also says display over it. The power button is on the top of the camera and it is small and blue. It also has Power written on the side. To take a picture there is a silver button bigger than the power button to push to snap the picture. It is located diagonal from the power button.
         A lot of people think it is so much money to buy it but if you think about the money you save in the long run it is a great deal. You do not have to buy film for the camera. That saves you a trip to the store. You also don't have to develop the film you just download them to your computer. And you don't have to mail the pictures to people you just send them through email.
