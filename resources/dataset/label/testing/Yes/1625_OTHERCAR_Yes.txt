            Let me be totally honest.  I had and LOVED my VW Jetta.  It was stolen after the second year mark.  When I reported the car stolen the police department informed me that the car was worth three times more in parts.  That fact discouraged me from buying the same car again.  I began my quest for an stylish car that I could depend on, and still afford on a teachers salary.  I needed a car that would not be high on the theft list, yet high performance.  I read good reviews in consumer reports about a car; Chevy's Prizm.  Everything I read about the car has been true.  The car is dependable, no major expensive repairs (all have remained below $250 each time), even after 6 years and 75,000 miles.  Only last month did I have to replace the original battery.  The car is roomy, it fits 5 adults.  I was able to the the LSI version with a sunroof, cassette, power everything, auto, ac, ABS brakes all for the same price of my original cars base model.  I would suggest that you also include alloyed wheels, the car looks sleek when all wheels capped, and losing hub caps are costly to replace.  You will save money in the long run.The only down side of this car is it's weight, it is on the light side.I have been extremely happy with my decision to purchase this car six years ago.  I expect to easily get another three or four more good years from this car.<br><br>
