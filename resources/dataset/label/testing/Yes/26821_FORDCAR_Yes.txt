            Hi I am a new member to epinions and I would like to share my opinion about the Ford Expedition we just leased.
I am so glad that we decided on this vehicle. I have never felt more secure in any other SUV. Some may think that it is very hard to drive , but i am 5'4 and have no trouble at all. The seat can move up or down, forward or back. You also can get the option of the gas pedals that will move , if you have short legs like me. It does not drive like a truck. it drives like a car, except for the gas mileage. 
I have a family of five and a Golden retriever, and we are sooooo comfortable. The back seat has lots of leg room for my 6'4 husband, and enough room acroos for my 3 children to have &quot; their space&quot;. I also have two of those children in car seats.
I wouldn't buy this vehicle if you do alot of city driving or commuting back and forth to work. Gas mileage is not the greatest. It cost 25-30$ to fill and it goes fast. If you don't mind that , then go for it. I do recommend the side rails to get in and out, especially if you have kids.
Thanks for reading,
Have a wonderful day.
