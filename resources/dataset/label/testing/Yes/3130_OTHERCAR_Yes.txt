            Let's put it in perspective.  The Hyundai Elantra is a quality car at an affordable price.  You aren't going to get performance, luxury, and looks from your friends when your car is roughly $12,000. But, with the Elantra you come close, well kind of.

The price and warranty were what sold me on the car.  10 year-100,000 miles bumper to bumper? Whoever heard of such a thing. I did. 5 year-50,000 miles on motor and tranny, you can't beat it. 

The looks of the car are sharp. Ergonomically, I have no complaints. The forest green with the beige interior look very nice.  The interior room is excellent in front and back.

Power windows, AC, rear defrost, power locks were standard.  That is a  lot of bang right there. The only other options were CD, Alloy rims, and moonroof. 

140 horsepower motor was decent for this car.  It's a pretty strong motor compared to the other 125 horses that are in most cars.

If I had to complain, and at this price I am not sure I have a right to, is the way the car handles.  It doesn't exactly hug the road.  Also, don't even think about having the window slightly open if it is raining, you will surely get drenched. Also, I found it strange that cruise control was not an option on 5 speeds.

If you are looking for a car, that is well priced, offers a lot of extras for no charge, and a warranty that should give you piece of mind, the Elantra is for you.  

When the time comes, I will seriously consider the Sonata.  Once again, what you get for the price, and what the critics have been saying is very impressive.  The other companies out there should keep a close eye, on the up and coming Hyundais.<br><br>
