               I've owned the Neon for 3 months now &amp; no problems or complaints.
The car has lots of pep, gets 26 mpg in town &amp; 35 on hiway &amp; rides &amp; handles extreemly well. For all practical purposes, it rides better than my Audi A6! I had a '95 Neon &amp; liked it so well, that I was an easy mark for the 2000, which is even better than the '95. Both cars were sticks &amp; it is my opinion that automatics have no place in small 4 cyl. cars. They rob too much power &amp; are wasteful with gas. The seats are very comfortable &amp; the fold down back seats are handy for hauling stuff like a ladder etc. I don.t believe there is another car in it's price range that can match it for performance &amp; gas mileage.<br><br>
