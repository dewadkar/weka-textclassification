            The Maxima is Nissan&#146s top of the line sedan. It has good handling, a great engine, a nice interior, and a great price.

The Maxima has some nice interior features including the sound system, comfortable seats, and well placed controls.

The sound system comes with an optional CD player. The system has a large number of high-powered speakers. They are strategically placed to make excellent use of the stereo&#146s 160 watts. The controls for the CD player are mounted on the steering wheel so that the driver can manipulate them without removing his hands from the wheel. This is especially nice for those who like to search and move about on the tracks while listening to music.

The seats are well contoured. They are supported in the right spots and are soft in the right spots. All seats, including the middle back seat, come with three point seat belts. All seats, this time exempting the middle rear seat, have head restraints. The seat belts can be moved up and down in the front seats to conform to the height of the occupants.

There are some aesthetic problems with the car. The shape of the car is appealing to some, while most unappealing to others. I personally hate the look of the car. I think it is reminiscent of the elephant and not the sporty family car it is supposed to be. Even the shape of the doors bothers me. The highly rounded doors seem as if they would impede loading of large objects into the back of the car.

The trunk of the car is one of it&#146s nicest features. It is cavernous. The only problem with the trunk is storing long and moderately wide objects. The rear seat folds down in the standard 60-40 format. This means that each seat folds down and the center seat folds down with one of those seats. The problem with this is that the hole that is opened into the back is very small. The dimensions of the hole are about 2&#146 by 2&#146. This allows for easy storage of skis, but not many pieces of lumber or a bike.

The engine of the car is one of the best in its class. It has a lot of power and easily propels this car forward. The acceleration is great and makes getting on the highway much easier and consequently less dangerous.

The handling is almost as good as the engine is. The car corners at high speeds without much roll and easily grips and handles the road well in all conditions. The grip of the steering wheel is comfortable. It is well contoured and makes for pleasant long trips.

The size of the front and rear seats allows for easy transportation of five adults. There is ample legroom front and back and each person has room to stretch. The shape of the center rear seat is also an improvement over earlier cars. It does not elevate the sitter as high as older cars used to do.

The Maxima is a pleasant car to drive and slightly less pleasant to look at. The combination of the price and performance though, outweigh the strain this car places on one&#146s eyes. This car is for those looking for a joy to drive for about 25,000. It performs well, feels well, hits the pocket about right, and only hurts when you see it from the outside.
