            After several months of searching for a very cheap ($1500) used car, I bought this Mazda and have been delighted ever since.  This car was obviously very well-maintained by the original owner; still, you would expect a few creaks and rattles out of a car this age - and there are none.  The handling is comfortable without being sloppy and the ride is far superior to the choppiness that is typical of cars this size. This vehicle takes bumps very well and if I closed my eyes I would swear I was driving a Toyota Camry.  The 5-spd transmission shifts smoothly and quietly and acceleration is anything but sluggish.  The dash is easy to read and everything is where you'd expect it to be.  I especially like the fact that any part of the center steering wheel will trigger the horn.  Some cars have little horn buttons and who has time to search for a little button in an emergency?  As a long-time owner of old, inexpensive cars, I feel lucky indeed to have come upon one that - to me - feels new.

On the down side, there is a problem with a seatbelt cable that is under recall.
