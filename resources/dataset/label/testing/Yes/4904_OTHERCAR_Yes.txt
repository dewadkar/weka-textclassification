            I've ever used Sony's digital camera before. It was the first model of Cybershot product line. I think it couldn't be compared with this newest model. Size, style, resolution, memory, battery life, functions and many more were concerned.

<b>Looks</b>
This camera was very impressed at my first sight. Sony made a good homework on its design, at least better than previous model in the line. Every buttons were in the correct place and not too many to be confused. The power button was designed not to accidentially activated. The unit could fit in my hand firmly.

<b>Functions</b>
This camera could record still image and short video clip. By the way, I need to take photos with only 640x480 of still image. As a result, it would be better if Sony released another sub-model with only still image function so that the price and size could be more reduced. I've also tried higher resolution and found that more memory and power have to be sacrificed. Only 5 highest-resolution pictures could be stored in a 8Mb memory stick, compared with more than 100 pictures using lowest resolution.

Another wonderful function is &quot;video output&quot; which could help me a lot on powerpoint presentation on TV without notebook. This camera have both 3x analog and another 3x digital zoom function (totally 6x). The lens was protected by pieces of thin plastic in the front but it is quite fragile.

As a physician, I sometimes need to take picture in the operative field. The problem of too much &quot;spot&quot; &amp; &quot;reflective&quot; light was not occurred with this camera.

After taking enough photos, all I have to do is pulling the memory stick out and insert it into floppy disk adapter to be copied to my PC. Unfortunately, the floppy disk adapter is compatible with only plain 1.44Mb floppy disk drive, not the superdisk drive of my notebook. At present, I carried only a camera, a floppy disk adapter and a floppy disk driver. (Floppy disk adapter is optional)

The enclosed USB cable could be used for transforming the camera to a memory stick drive to manipulate any files. However, the unit could detect only photo file with the name &quot;DSCXXXXX&quot; where X means number.

<b>Battery life</b>
It would be wonderful if I could take as much photos as I need without concerning the battery. Nevertheless, Sony's &quot;Infolithium&quot; battery, which means battery that could send its information back to the device, was quite impressive because I could know when will the charging process be finished.

<b>Optional Bag?</b>
I couldn't explain to myself why Sony didn't give any &quot;bag&quot; for the camera in the package. I think this is the most important point which couldn't be concerned by only &quot;profit&quot; reason. Another interesting option is water-resistant protective case but I think I don't need it right now.

<b>Summary</b>
The camera would be my partner for a very long time, using only lowest resolution of still image.<br><br>
