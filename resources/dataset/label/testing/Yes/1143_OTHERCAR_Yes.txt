            I have owned a couple of economy cars ('94 Mazda MX-3 and '87 Nissan Pulsar).  However, since then I have moved on the mid-sized bracket and am pretty much happy with the cars I own now.  

So, when I went to visit a friend, I decided to save a couple of bucks and try out a Compact car rental for a week.  I got either a Neon or Cavalier, and with my disdain for GM, I tried the Neon.

Let me first say this is a stripper model.  No power windows, no power locks, no tach.  

The positives: 

Engine: The 2.0 I4 engine was always torquey and powerful, but in previous models, it always sounded like it was sitting next to you.  This engine is much better isolated and quieter, but not less powerful or restricted.  It can really gun the car to highway speeds in a decent amount of time (unlike my old Pulsar with it's 70 hp engine), or at least it felt that way.

Suspension: It was pretty compliant and quiet.  It also handled very well, better than a friend's 1999 Civic I drove a few weeks earlier.

Controls Ergonomics: Everything is where it should be and the quality of the controls felt very solid.  I liked the controls of the A/C more than in other cars I have driven.

Room: Lots of it, and in the trunk too.  Didn't try the backseats but no one complained.

Weaknesses: 

Transmission: Who the heck still puts in 3-speed autos any more?  This makes the car louder than it should be on the highway.  Trust me, if there is a 4 speed auto on this car, take it.  I was always waiting for it to go into overdrive to no avail....

Radio: It is a poor radio and poor design, I have seen this design date back to Chryslers in the 1980's.  There are too many controls and the pathetic 3 band eq (with it's tiny controls need to be replaced).

Seating: The seats are too flat to provide much support.  While comfortable on the butt, the seat back hurt my back after an hour of driving.  They also ride low and I like to put my arm on the window sill, but couldn't due to the seat height.

Cupholders: A minor complaint.  I like the fold up type, not the one that is molded into the ergonomics of the front dash.  It is also non-adjustable as well.

Noise: There was a rumbling at 50 mph.  It was annoying, but had no idea on what it was.  It sounded mechanical.  Not good on a car that had 4500 miles.

Overall, it is a nice car with good power, decent refinement and no real outstanding problems (or redeeming qualities).  However, I have no information on it's reliability but all Daimler-Chrysler cars have been pretty lackluster on this regard, but I wont hold it against them.
