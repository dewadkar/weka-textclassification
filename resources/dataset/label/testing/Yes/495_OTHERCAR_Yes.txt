            My '90 Mx-6 has been a trusted friend. Not surprising since I purchased it from a good family friend. I bought it with 100,000 miles on it. Considering its high miles, I didn't expect too much. It was cheap and I needed a car. Now four years later and another 45,000 miles, I am sold on Mazdas!
   The interior comfort is really amazing. I can sit for ten hours straight and not mind. The control layout is logical, not as quite as good as a Honda, but close enough. I've only had minor work on the car, mostly preventive procedures and not bad for a car with nearly 145,000 miles. 
    The style has worn well. It still looks good in and out without a trace of rust. The engine is powerful for a four cylinder and the steering and handling are above average. The automatic transmission is not the best I've driven. Shifts with a shudder sometimes and hunts for the right gear. Also the motorized seatbelts are a major drawback. They are slow and get stuck often.
   Overall, I've been very happy with my MX-6. The superior reliability, performance and comfort especially after all of this time make it a winner.

Update: As of 10/19/00 my MX-6 is no longer with me. On a sharp curve on a wet night, I lost control of the car hit a curb and destroyed the front suspension. The cost to repair the damage was more than the car was worth. I'm heartbroken over the loss of the car but I will always highly recommend this car to anyone, many wonderful years and memories.<br><br>
