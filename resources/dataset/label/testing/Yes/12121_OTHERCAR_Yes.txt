            I rented this car on a business trip and was surprised and pleased by how well built this car really is.  It's a good solid car and well priced.

<b>Power:</b>  This car is actually pretty peppy for a four-banger.  The automatic tranny know when to shift for quick passing and acceleration isn't bad either.  I was really pleased by how well this car did on the freeway.  You felt comfortable making those last-second decisions thanks to other drivers.  For those of you who like numbers, 130 hp @ 5500 rpm and 130 lb/ft of torque @ 3000 rpm.

<b>Interior:</b>  The room and comfort of this car was excellent.  I felt very secure taking a corner at high speed and the radio controls were very easy to reach (although I never tried both at the same time).  There was plenty of room in the glove box and the center console.  I also find the swinging air vents in the middle front to be totally cool.

<b>Trunk Space:</b>  The trunk seemed to have plenty of space for two people to take a week's vacation.  Plus, the rear seats fold down which allows even more stuff.  I don't have any kids so I wouldn't know how much they have to pack.  There shouldn't be any problem though.

<b>Options:</b>  You can option this baby out to your hearts content.  You can get a V-6, 16 inch wheels, Bose stereo and traction control.  I have only seen one totally optioned out in pictures and it looks great!  This car would look very cool in my garage!

<b>Overall:</b>  This car is an exceptional car for it's price.  The designers really did their homework and should be commended for their talent.  The only problem I have is with the warranty; three years/50K miles.  I miss the days of the five year/60K warranty.  That would show the manufacturer's confidence in their product.  Even with that, I would definitely recommend this car to my friends.<br><br>
