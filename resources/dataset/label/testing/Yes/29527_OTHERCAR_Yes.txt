            This is a fantastic camera.  It's VERY easy to use - I didn't need the manual to get started.  You don't have to manipulate settings to get a perfect picture.  I've printed 8x10s and they're beautiful (not quite as sharp as 8x10s from a regular camera, but pretty close).  

The controls are all logically placed and the menus are very easy to navigate. It comes with the rechargeable batteries and battery pack and all of the cables you need to get started, but does NOT include an AC adapter, which I highly recommend for transfers to your PC. I use my USB cable and the pix download to my PC very quickly.  

The only extras I  bought were the AC adapter, a camera case (which I got for $13), and an extra set of rechargeable batteries ($15).  Coupled with my inexpensive color ink jet printer and some photo paper, I get near-photographic quality prints. And best of all, I don't waste money developing pictures that don't turn out right half the time, I don't miss important shots, and I can easily categorize my pix on my PC (and avoid sorting through, identifying and captioning boxes full of pictures).  If you don't have the space to store your pix on your hard drive, there are now many free online services that let you store your prints (and create cards, etc.).  This camera is the best thing I've bought in a long time.  Highly recommended!

P.S. I bought it refurbished from Ubid.com and it has the same warranty as a new one. <br><br>
