            A quarter of a million miles and still running every day.  

My car had dropped its gas tank on the pavement on the way to school and it became apparent that I would need to get another vehicle.  My parents steered me down the road to the nearest Toyota dealer.  At the time they were advertising $1500 for anything you could push pull or drag onto the lot.  I ended up leasing (never again) an '86 Truck.  It was the basest of all trucks on the lot.  No air, no fuel injection, no radio.

Now, 13 years later, it looks old.  It has been in a couple of fender-benders.  It has gone through 5 clutches (1 flywheel), 3 alternators several sets of tires and several sets of brake shoes.  I have NEVER had a serious problem with this vehicle that was not caused by one of the afore-mentioned fender-benders.  All I have to do is change the oil religiously and put gas in it (recommend Amoco silver--runs better and gets mileage to warrant the extra expense).  I have just put in the 3rd set of spark plugs.  (Original-BoschPlatinum and now SplitFires.)

If you need a good used vehicle and you have an option to buy a mid-80's model Toyota pickup with lots of miles--have no fear.  The fact that someone has put those miles on that truck should tell you that it runs almost every day and as long as it's not blowing blue or white smoke out the tailpipe will give you service for several more miles.<br><br>
