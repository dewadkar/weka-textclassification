            INTRO:
I recently picked up one of the PowerShot A20s shortly after purchasing a Powershot A40 for myself.  I was impressed with the A40's quality, and wanted to pick up a camera for my mother who didn't need the manual controls the A40 offers.  Since the Powershot A20 was on close-out, I managed to get it for $200.

PERFORMANCE:
Wow.

The resolution was on-par with the A40s. Color quality and fidelity were very, very comparable to those on the A40.  It had less options to mess with, which is a plus for many.  Lag time between pressing the button and the image being taken was about 3/4 of a second, which is perfectly acceptible.  The 3X zoom works smoothly.  The LCD is useful in all but the brightest lights.

COMPATIBILITY:
I use iPhoto on MacOS X on a Beige G3 (upgraded to a G4) as well as Canon's own software under Windows XP on an Athlon XP.  MacOS X and Windows XP recognized the camera on plug-in.  Impressive.  Since the A20 uses standard compactflash type-1 memory, it can use just about any solid state media out there, which can be used in readers, printers, etc.  It will not, however, support IBM's CF Type-2 mini-hard drives.

THE BIG TEST:
My mother, whom the camera was purchased for, was a total digital newbie.  After about 10 minutes of showing her how to use it and some Q/As, she's now shooting like a pro.  She knows that the 1600x1200 resolution is for printing, and 640x480 is for sending via email.  She doesn't bother with her old Kodak Advantix anymore; the A20's much more substancial.  She uses her sub-photo quality Lexmark for making quick prints and she takes her CF card down to the camera store for bigger prints.  So much for her insistance on using film. :)

OVERALL: Recommended
If you need an easy to use, no frills camera that will give you astounding quality and clarity, time after time with a real, true optical zoom of 3x, I recommend this camera if you can still find it.  However, if you either can't find it or need more manual aperture and exposure controls, pick up the Powershot A40.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
Buy a set of 8 1800MA NiMH batteries and a larger (64-256MB) Compact Flash Card.  The 8 batteries will leave you with 4 spares if you need them and the larger CF card will allow you to shoot all day/week.
