            I first came in contact with this camera because I am a web designer, and a client needed to download their photos from it for their website. He was having trouble figuring out the ins and outs of it, so it was up to me to get the images from the camera. On first inspection, it seemed like a nightmare. I am very familiar with manipulating digital images but not familiar with all the tools of photography. This particular camera had extra goodies. It came with a tripod, fisheye lens and lots of software. 

So, what did I do? I took a deep breath, got the manual out and handled it with kid gloves. Step by step, I began to learn this camera. I found out that there was nothing to be afraid of, if you could actually figure out the effects from each setting, you were rewarded with stunning images. 

After taking my first pictures, it took me a week to get the images off the camera. I was having trouble with the software to detect the photos, but it was all made better once my computer crashed and I blanked out the hard drive. After installing the software again, I found my photos. I do not believe that anyone else I know had this trouble, just me! 

I was very impressed by the photos it took, and since I am having to use this camera often, I am still consulting the manual. The battery seems to last fairly well, much better than my Vivitar. I enjoy using the fisheye lens and can't wait to see my images with IPIX. It is not the camera that infuriates me anymore it is IPIX! 

They charge to use their software by making you pay for registration keys or they also charge for a membership. This is well worth it for my client since he is in real estate, but I feel that if you purchase software, it should be ready to create with, not ready to milk people for more money. By the way, I still haven't figured IPIX out completely. Call me stupid, I don't know; perhaps I am just brain dead, but it needs to be more user friendly for us not completely familiar with photography and algebra concepts. I already have enough to figure out with scripting languages!

I feel that if you are ready to purchase a great camera and are ready to invest the time it takes to learn how it works, then you will be very pleased with the Nikon. It takes great photos. It does get easier, it is just IPIX that is my headache!
