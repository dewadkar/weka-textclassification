            The Fuji Finepix 4900Z is my first camera. With that in mind, please don't expect this review to be highly technical from a pro's point of view. I don't even know how to operate most of the functions on my camera, although I've had it for 1 1/2 months now. This is just a basic review from a beginner's perspective.  

I bought the 4900Z in Dec. '00 after reading several glowing reviews from several websites. My initial intention was to use the camera to take my own photos as an actress, saving the professional photography cost. I have taken some satisfactory shots, but nothing that compares to my pictures taken by a pro using film - and I don't expect that. However, for the price, I don't like the fact that the photos are grainy at times.  

Within the first week, I shot a lot outdoors. I was surprised by the clear, sharp quality. My hands are shaky, but most weren't blurry. 

I really don't understand the point of having the capability to shoot short videos without AUDIO?? Cheaper cameras have THAT capability! 

I am using the HP Photosmart 1218 printer and am impressed with most of the prints from the Fuji. They look like postcards! 
 
Not having prior experience with other cameras to compare, I guess I'd say this camera's alright. At times it seems to have the quality of a disposable. For other shots, great quality. But I regret not having saved a few hundred more to get a Sony because the Sony online shot samples were much better - like film. However, once I learn to use the Fuji, I'll probably see the results that so many are raving about.
