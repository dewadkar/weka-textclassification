            I purchased my Dodge Durango in June of 1998 after my 1996 Chrysler Town and Country mini Van failed to take me to my summer home because of a light dusting of snow....the van actually wound not make it up the steep mountain incline.  I chose the Dodge Durango because of its very unusual style body and the fact that it had 3 rows of seats...that comes in handy when you have 4 children.  When I first saw the Durango, I was impressed with what this truck had to offer.  I was a little spoiled from my previous car.  I had an overhead console with trip monitor, I also had a VCR and a Color TV...I really wanted to keep all the options of what I previously had to my new purchase.  I searched many dealerships till I found what I was looking for.  I had my Durango equipped with an overhead console, Infinity CD player with 10 speakers. 3 seats (7 passenger), rear heat and AC and power windows, door locks and seats.  Also it had to have a powerful engine to take me up the mountain.

Well, I have this truck for almost 3 years now and I have much to say about it.  First, this truck is really not a cruising car...it is a truck.
It handles winding mountain roads with ease, it hugs the road.  When switching from regular road to off the road (4 wheel drive), it is done with ease and anyone can do it.  I sincerely love my Durango for short trips, but when taken on the road for longer than 3 hours, you get what I call Durango Butt....a new type of illness.  It is a pain that stretches from your lower back to your thigh area.  That is if you sit in the front seat.  For those who sit in the middle seat, you are prone to leg cramp.  And as far as the rear fold down seat.  If you are not an infant or a really small child, I truly suggest you don't go back there...there is absolutely no leg room there.

When it comes to Cargo area there is plenty when the rear seat is folded down, but when it is up, there is only room for 3 or 4 bags of groceries.  If you have more than 4 bags of groceries, it is suggested you purchase a plastic container or a grocery net to stop the bags from rolling all over the place...(I just found some groceries under my front seat...how it rolled all the way over there I shall never know).

This vehicle really is great for off the road.  But if you plan to use it for city driving, I suggest you invest in a gas pump on your property...this baby sure can eat gas.  Don't get me wrong....on long trips it really is great considering it is a large 8 cylinder.  I can go 300 miles on one fill up.  But short distance driving the gas really goes.
If you plan on purchasing a 1998 Dodge Durango, make sure all the factory recalls have been performed on it.  Since owning my Durango, I have had to bring it in to the shop on several occasions.  The worst problem I have had with mine is a problem with the steering column and ball joints.  After only having the truck for a few months, I started to have some problems with the front end and the steering wheel.  After calling Chrysler the problem was repaired. I have spoken to a few other Durango owners and they too have had this problem.  I also have just been notified about another recall on a part for the gas tank.  At least Chrysler is taking care of the problems.  I find that very impressive.  
The Dodge Durango is a great little truck but it does have some problems, but for what I use it for it is perfect.  When purchasing this vehicle, make sure it is what you are looking for in an a SUV.  Make sure this is the vehicle for you.

As far as maintaining this vehicle, there is very little you have to do other that check the hoses and change the oil every 3000 miles.  Also remember when washing this car, be very careful with the paint...it can easily scratch.  Do not use abrasive cleaners or brushes.  Wet the vehicle down first to remove any grit.  With a soft sponge or cloth soap the vehicle down and than rinse.  Dry with a soft cloth of chamois.  When you wax this vehicle, use a good quality wax or bring to a professional detailer.  You will only have to wax this vehicle once a year.
My overall view of this vehicle is a really great truck.  Great for short trips and great for off the road driving.  I give this vehicle a thumbs up for the ladies as far a ease of switching from regular driving to 4 wheel drive.
