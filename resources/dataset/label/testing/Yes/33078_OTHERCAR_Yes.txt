            MY FRIENDS GMC SONOMA WAS THE BEST TRUCK AROUND. YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE BEATING THIS TRUCK TOOK. TRY TAKING YOUR TRUCK THOUGH A CORN FIELD, 40 MPH THOUGH ALLIES,AND JUMPS GALORE. I CAN ALWAYS FALL BACK ON MY WORD THAT GM IS THE BEST, BECAUSE THIS TRUCK PROVED IT TO ME. IN THIS TRUCKS 14,000 MILE LIFE IT SHOULD HAVE HAD 140,000 MILES ON IT. AFTER SENDING IT INTO A LIGHTPOLE AT 30 SIDEWAYS, AND 2 MONTHS LATER IT STARTED AND RAN GREAT, IT STILL WANTED MORE PUNISHMENT. IT REALLY SUCKED THAT THIS TRUCK WAS TOTALLED BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEATING THIS TRUCK COULD POSSIBILY TAKE. IT WAS VERY PEPPY FOR THE STOCK 2.2 LITER. IT COULD ALSO MATCH THE POSI MARKS OF A 1968 PONTIAC LEMANS WITH A 6.6 LITER ENGINE, VERY IMPRESSIVE. AT 70 DUMPING IT INTO 3rd GEAR WAS NO PROBLEM TO PASS THAT STUBBORN ELDERLY PERSON WITH THEIR BUICK THAT INSISTS TO DO 55 MPH. IT COULD VERY UNCOMFORTABLY SIT 3 EVEN BEING STICK SHIFT!!! THAT LITTLE TRUCK WAS THE ULTIMATE TRUCK FOR ANY PURPOSE IN MIND. THE ONLY COMPLIANT THAT WE HAD IS THAT STUPID MPH LIMITER, AT 96 MPH YOU COULD NOT REALLY FIND THE POTENTIAL OF THIS WANNA-BE HIGH PERFORMANCE TRUCK. ONE OTHER COMPLIANT WOULD BE THE STUPID REV-LIMITER, WHAT IS THAT FOR???? OHHH WELL DOESEN'T MATTER. THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT SOULD BUY THIS VEHICLE IS THE PERSON THAT CANNOT AFFORD A HUMMER, YES A HUMMER. THAT IS HOW STRONGLY I FELL ABOUT THIS 2wd, 2.2 LITER, 5sp, POWERHOUSE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY A VERY AFFORDABLE TRUCK I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TRUCK FOR EVEN A FORD LOVER. <br><br>
