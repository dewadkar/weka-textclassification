                 The Escort has long been Fords &quot;money car&quot; not meaning in sales but after overhead is payed they make the most off of the Escort.  I bought a 99 ZX2 hot addition about 7 months ago and while pleased with the sporty look and even more sporty accleration these cars are still Escorts and are not made to go fast.  I recived my proof when I droped the transmission after 7,000 miles.  The cars are perfectley fit for a early to mid 20's, because there sporty look ease to drive and also a great factory sound system.  People with kids might want to look into a diffrent version of the Escort due to the limited rear leg room and seating for only 4.  Personaly I love the fact of the bad road handeling abilities of the car in rain it dosent skip a beat and in snow it only has trouble on accleration from a stop scince the car has alot of torque.  If your looking for a car that handles as well as it looks and are into driving a car with 130 HP DOHC engine wich is enough to blow a 95 Beretta GT off the road the ZX2 is your car, because of the modest price, I was able to talk the sales man down to 13,800 for the most expensive addition, The ZX2 Hot is a great car.
