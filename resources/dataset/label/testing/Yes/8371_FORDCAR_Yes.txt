            i have an older version of the explorer, a '92, with 129,000 miles on it and it still runs strong.  it was extremely tough to drive when i first started, but as i got used to it, it feels like driving a car now.  because my version has the less padded seats and less options, it has tons of space, unlike some of the newer versions.  I can fit everything i need for my college dorm room in the back with no trouble or i can fit a bunch of fraternity brothers in back to drive them over to the dining hall. The car has tons of power and drives perfectly on the highway.  and the 4-wheel drive is great in the snow and ice.<br><br>
