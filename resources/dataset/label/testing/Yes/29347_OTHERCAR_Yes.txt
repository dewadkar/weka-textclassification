            I bought a 1998 Honda CRV in Feb 2000. It was my first &quot;real&quot; vehicle - I had a junker to learn on, followed by a sweet old Accord Hatchback that lost its life early when a drunk driver plowed into it (parked). I decided to go with something that would last, and I did months of research, and decided the CRV was my dreammobile... but I had never really seen one up close or been in one. I'd never test driven a car either, in my life... but one morning I went to a reputable Honda dealership (Albany City Honda... great outfit), to do so. I figured, this is what I'd get if I liked it - but first I had to drive one. 

I already knew that they sold themselves and it wasn't easy finding a '98 - it seemed most people kept them for 3 years if they had one, because they loved it. But when I got to the dealership, they had one JUST come in - in the color I wanted. I test drove it. I LOVED it. And I hate to admit it, but I literally bought it off the lot. It just seemed so very right to me. 

Well, I can say, 10 months later, its the best rash decision I ever made :) I'm a road trip junkie, and love to drive, and the Curvy (my dad's nickname for it) has not given a moments trouble. Its smooth, really fun to drive, feels safe and solid, has TONS of room for whatever I want to pack or drag home with me. I find it very enjoyable to drive in every way. It is lacking in power, I suppose, but the beastie has some kick with it nonetheless, and I haven't had any trouble except when occasionally trying to run up a steep hill. But, I find if I change gears, it fires right up there. I would prefer not to have more power, anyway, if it is going to make it a gas hog so I'm happy. For someone who drives as much as I do - I put 15k miles on it in 10 months and I DON'T drive to work - that's just road trips - the gas mileage is fabulous as well. I cant' say what it is exactly but its not much different than I had with my car and seems very reasonable. 

I would recommend the CRV to just about anyone who asked - but it seems particularly geared to women, to urban professionals, people with kids, and its suitable for guys, with plenty of head and leg room but they might think its too weak for a boy :) <br><br>
