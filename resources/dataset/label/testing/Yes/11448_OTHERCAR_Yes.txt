            Even though this is my first digital camera, it's not the first I've used.  I got the camera in march after much searching.  It seems no one has one in stock, probably because it is the top seller in asia at the moment.  I opted for the black model since everyone else I know has silver cameras, especially canons, and I couldn't find one of the red, orange, or blue ones.
 
What first attracted me to this camera was the leica lens.  It has the latest leica DC vario-elmarit lens which has received great reviews (leica is one of the greatest lens developers in the world).  Speaking of reviews, CNet has a terrific write up on this camera.  

Second attraction was its styling and size.  I wanted a pocket camera with very good quality so I considered the pentax optio S (the one that fits into an altoids tin) and the canon elph.  Since the panasonic lumix is slightly larger than these two it is much easier to use and handle and no quality was sacrificed for a smaller size like the other cameras.  This camera still is a true pocket camera and I take it with me almost everywhere I go.  

Since all my friends have elphs and a sony mavica I have been able to do direct comparisons with them.  I am in no means a photographer.  I've owned film cameras in the past but didn't take many pictures because of the inconvenience of film.  Let me tell you, This camera is 10 times better than those cameras (well the mavica takes extremely close macro shots).  Color and clarity is amazing, and I was only using the auto modes.  Now everyone is thinking of upgrading their cameras.

One thing could be better.  Movie mode is only 10 fps at 320x240 so motion is a little choppy and small.  Many other cameras top this, at least with more frames per second but I've only taken three quick movies compared to well over 200 stills since I bought it.  Also if you happen to use the tiny view finder instead of the LCD, pay no attention to the crop marks, they end up being off quite a bit.  The LCD is much better and that's one of the great things about digitals anyway.

All in all, I'm very happy with this camera.  It's very stylish and very, very unique and as a bonus, it takes amazingly beautiful photos.  I only wish it didn't say "panasonic" across the front because people tend to dismiss it for that.  By the way, the included software is excellent as well, much better than what comes with the canons.  enjoy
