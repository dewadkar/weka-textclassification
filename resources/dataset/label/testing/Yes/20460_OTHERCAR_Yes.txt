            I'm sorry, but I really must disagree with the general Mac-like loyalty and simpering. This car was and is an unmitigated disaster - it was an absurd anachronism which came about through lies, corruption and manipulation. 
The original design concept however was a fairly clean and bold vision by Pininfarina, but from there, things went rapidly downhill. Locating the factory in Ireland was responsible for most of the flaws. The Irish workforce were under trained, under funded and under nourished (my grandfather was a worker there). They deviated from the blueprints in the interest of cost-cutting so frequently, that by the end of the line, the car was 20KG lighter than it should have been. 
The overall product of course, failed. The stainless steel veneer was inadequately glued to the body, the doors only had a single strut, the windscreen was so raked that you could barely see the front of the car. 
To sum up, I think the car (the original production model, not the heavily augmented enthusiasts' show pieces)was brutally ugly, inconsistent, ergonomically bereft, dangerous and foul.
