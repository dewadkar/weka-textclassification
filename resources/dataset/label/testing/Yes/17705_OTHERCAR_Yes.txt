            I've owned two Saturns over the past several years... both being hand-me-downs by parents. The first was a blue (my girlfriend argues green) Saturn SL '95 -- which lasted me up to 85,000 miles (before it was traded in for my sister's new, soon to be arriving, Saturn LS). I used it for many, many trips (I'm a college student) -- so whether I was off on Spring Break or just heading home (500 miles away), it never left me stranded, and I never had any major problems (besides the color disagreement). My only complaint, because it was an SL and only 4 cylinders, that it didn't have much pick-up speed. So it took awhile to catch up to speed with others on a highway, as it chugged along. Once it did pick up in speed, it ran very, very smoothly. If you're looking for a dependable, inexpensive used car, an older Saturn is perfect for you (or maybe your kids... or maybe your parents depending on who's reading this). 

My new(er) Saturn is a '97 SL1 which has 6 cylinders. So it has the pick-up speed I was looking for. (Plus there's no argument in the color... it's black). I've only had it for a few months, but so far it's a dream come true -- no problems and no complaints. It's a great car for the price, is very dependable and gets good gallons per mile. 

If you have a few extra $'s to put towards an SL1 or SL2, I'd recommend it. Although, in any case, my Saturns have gotten me through a lot of trips safe and sound. Overall, I'd recommend Saturn cars to any buyer.<br>
