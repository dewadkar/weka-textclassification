            On a recent trip I was given a Daewoo Leganza as a rental car.  When offered, I said &quot;a what?&quot;.  When I saw the car I was pleasantly surprised at it's somewhat &quot;European&quot; styling.  I even heard a few compliments on the cars looks.

The interior was equally as nice.  Roomy and comfortable.  Plenty of leg room and the driver's seat was fully adjustable.  A flaw I found was that even though the head rest has various adjustments, I could not get it to lean back and thus always had to sit driving with my head slightly pushed forward.  Another annoyance was the inability to lock the car unless the doors are closed.  That caused me to have to use the key in the door everytime I got out of the car.

The 4 cylinder engine that came with the model I had was adequete for city driving but lacked pick-up on the highway.  No numbers, but the gas mileage seemed to be good also.

Overall, not a bad car as an alternative to the familiar brands.<br><br>
