            Well, I have to say, my Cavalier has been a good little car. I have a 98' model Cavalier Z24. I bought it in September of 97'. It now has about 96,000 miles as of March 19, 2000. I have really piled on the miles in a short time. It has given me NO PROBLEMS!!! The only thing that I have had to fix is the front right spindle hub. For those of you that are clueless on what that is, it's the part that holds the wheel to the car, so it's a pretty important piece to have. Anyway, I had to replace it because I hit a pothole that was about a foot deep at 70 MPH!!! It was covered under the warranty of course, so no problem there.

My cavy has the 2.4 liter, 4 cylinder engine, and I must say, it surprised me with the power it has. I was worried about the performance of the engine when I first bought the car, because I had a 90' Cavalier Z24 as well, and it had a 3.1 liter V-6. It was rated to have 150 H.P., and so was my new 4 cylinder!! I couldn't tell a difference at first, but now that the miles are on my 98', it's showing some weakness compared to the 90' model with the same mileage. All in all, it's still a great running car.

I had most of the &quot;features&quot; installed on the car when I bought it. They included, Power mirrors, power windows, and power locks. It also came with a CD Player. I chose to go with the 5 speed manual transmission as well. It gets a little better gas mileage than the automatic. On average I get about 28-32 M.P.G. With all the electronics in this car, no problems what so ever!! Very surprising!!
