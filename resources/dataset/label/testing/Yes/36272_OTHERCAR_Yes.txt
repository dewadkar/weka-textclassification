<TEXT>
            I have been driving a '98 Toyota Corolla for almost a year and I love it.  The car maneuvers well, the engine is extremely quiet and smooth, and it handles well in winter (believe me, with these upstate New York winters, I have to have a car that handles well in snow).  The car is quite compact though; it does seat four, but the back seats always seem crowded, as there is not much leg room behind the front seats.  The factory stereo system included with mine was better (and louder) than most I've heard.  Corollas come equipped with dual airbags and daylights, features that always keeps me feeling safe.  The sleek body always gets complements, and I love every second of driving my car.  Also, there is a lot of trunk space, which is ideal for toting around whatever it is that you need to transport.  If you are looking for a family-size car and you like the Corolla, I would suggest looking into the Toyota Camry.  It is a little more expensive, but the room inside is probably worth it.  The only negative aspect of the car is that the trunk lock is embedded in the right rear tail light, so replacing a broken tail light might be costly.<br><br>
