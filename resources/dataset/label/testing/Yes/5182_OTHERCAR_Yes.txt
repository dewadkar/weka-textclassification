            <b>Update 8/00</b>

30 months and 44,000 miles.  Owning this car has been an incredibly worry-free experience (driving in San Francisco is another story).  No odd behaviors, squeaks, rattles, or strange noises.  I just got a 45K mile (intermediate) service, and even that involved very little maintenance work.  The car is still on the original tires and wheel alignment.  The front brake pads will need their first replacement at the next service.

The <i>worst</i> glitch I can think of is that the passenger door seal occasionaly sticks shut on cold nights and has to be opened from the inside.  I believe this problem affects only a few of the earliest coupes of this generation.  The next worst problem might be some paint chips on the front bumper, on the corners of the hood around the grill, and on the sides behind the rear wheels.  It's a subjective call, but I think the paint is thin and chips easily.  Using touch up paint on the bumpers is pretty straightforward and effective, but since it's lumpy with a matte finish, I wouldn't use it on a conspicuous part of the car.

<b>Original review 10/99</b>

20 months and 34,000 miles later I'm still admiring this car when I walk away from it.  The '98 Accord Coupe EX-V6 was a great buy for $23K, and it has a modest cost of ownership, plus it uses 87 octane gas.  I wanted a new car that was better than entry level, but not more than $25K, with good styling, ergonomics, comfort for four, and reliability.

<b>The drive</b>

The 3.0L 200HP V6, as other reviews have stated, is best at higher revs where the SOHC VTEC kicks in.  The car does a 75mph cruise at smooth and &quot;lazy&quot; 2500rpm -- there's more tire noise than anything else -- but when passing and merging at the 6500rpm redline you get a pleasant growl out of the engine and ample acceleration.  When idling, it's hard to tell if the engine is running.  The ride is very comfortable and suitable for 40 minute commutes.  The suspension is a little soft, even though it has anti-roll bars, and the Michelin MXV4 EnergyPlus tires squeal at the slightest provocation.  The tire noise seems excessive; some reviews cite lack of soundproofing as the problem.  The tires are also an oddball size (205/60R16), which limits your tire upgrade options.

<b>The interior</b>

The interior has seat belts and seating for five (at least for neighborhood trips).  But getting the power driver's seat out of the way is a slow process, and there's no memory to restore the seat's position.  So I find myself having everybody get in from the passenger side.  Nice touches include an overhead sunglasses holder, lots of storage compartments, and a stealthy coin holder pocket.  The stereo sound is mediocre (at freeway driving volume) and there is no upgrade option.  Apparently it's due to cheesy speakers; the factory head unit is fine and you probably wouldn't need an amp unless you wanted to add a subwoofer.  Also, the car is not prewired for a CD changer (dealer installed option), so adding one is pretty labor intensive.

<b>The features</b>

I chose the EX-V6 trim level in part because the other trims each lack some of these features:  leather upholstery and fake wood trim (easy to scratch), 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, 8-way power seat with adjustable lumbar support (takes some getting used to if you're tall), climate control, audio controls on steering wheel (terrific feature), HomeLink garage opener (lets you put away the openers), remote entry with remote trunk release (good for scaring passersby in a parking lot), power moonroof with tilt, and auto-off headlights.

<b>The changes</b>

New for '99 Accord Coupes was folding side mirrors.  New for '00 is side airbags on most trim levels, plus a more sensible set of color options -- before, some colors were only available on the cheaper trim levels.  However, the paint is pretty thin and doesn't have a lot of gloss to it.  Most colors are named something &quot;Pearl&quot;, 'cause if you look closely at a reflection, it has little ripples like the skin of an orange.  Mine was around number 13,000 of a new generation, so it did pick up some improved parts under warranty -- a redesigned moonroof glass/seal and a steering wheel with a slightly different finish.  Some weatherstripping was also added inside one door to stop a rattle.  At the time, it was a &quot;hot car&quot; and when I tried to buy it, most dealers wouldn't even take my name.  I lucked out because somebody cancelled their pre-order from four months earlier, and the fleet dealer let me slip in.

<b>The target market</b>

This coupe was targeted at baby boomers and happens to appeal to younger buyers, too.  So it's no sports car, just a sporty coupe -- automatic transmission only, just like the current Acura CL (aka Legend) that it shares a powertrain with.  It's front engine and front wheel drive, with the usual non-optimal weight distribution.   I have mixed feelings about the body kit.  Overall, it looks better, but it looks like it's just bolted on, because it is.  The car does seem like it's riding a little high.

<b>The alternatives</b>

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the choice I made.  Back in '98 there was no Toyota Solara (sort of a &quot;me, too&quot; product that isn't quite as pretty).  The Camry was too bland.  There also wasn't an Acura TL, an upscale cousin that uses a bored and stroked version of the same Accord Coupe engine to get 225HP.  The VW Passat's interior was somewhat lacking.  I didn't look at the A4, but it's eyecatching.  The Honda Prelude still looks too weird and isn't practical.  The Civic and the Integra didn't seem very comfortable on long rides.  The now discontinued Nissan 240SX was also too small.  There really just aren't that many good looking cars available in the realm of the ordinary.
