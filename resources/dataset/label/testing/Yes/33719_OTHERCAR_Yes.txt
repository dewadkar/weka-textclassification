            I got this car used a couple of years ago, and I can tell you first hand that it is a pretty good car for any situation really. It handles well and the brakes are awesome. Read on please.

EXTERIOR: 8
I have a tan Mystique and it looks great externally. The car was in great shape when I got it. The tires and paint job are excellent and flawless. Nothing much to complain about in this area.

INTERIOR: 7
The interior is tan as well and the seats are very comfortable. The best thing about the interior is that it is really roomy, with plenty of space for friends and family. There could have been a little more leg room, but overall, it's a very roomy interior. The dashboard and controls are easy to activate and are within easy reach of the driver and passenger. The car came with a AM/FM stereo cassette deck. The sound system is EXTREMELY good for a default made one and never hesitate to crank up the music in it, as it can handle it well.

HANDLING: 7
Very nice tight control here. The brakes are very good and quickly responsive. The only problem is the steering wheel, which is somewhat larger than most, but dealable nonetheless. 

RIDE: 7
This car provides a very smooth ride, the only complaint is there is somewhat of a humming sound coming from the frontend wheels. This may not be a major problem, I'm going to have it checked by the mechanics.

RELIABILITY: 7
This car is very dependable, only have had to have the battery replaced, that's it. Other than that, it's been running smooth since I got it.

THE VERDICT: A nice all around car, for teenagers or adults alike. This car handles well in all situations and is dependable. 

AVERAGE SCORE: 8.50 out of 10
VARA'S PERSONAL RATING: 8.5 out of 10
