            I personally drive a Ford Escort 1.6i 16v hatch back.  I it bought as at the time it was fairly priced, had a good mileage and has a reputation for being reliable.
Four years on, I still have my Ford, and enjoy it every minute that I drive it.  It's lively engine is quite sporty for a family style of car, getting to 60 in a about 10 seconds flat.  The thing about the Escort is that it likes to be pushed hard, especially in 2nd and 3rd gears. 2nd will easily pull you up to 60 mph should you need it to, and then 3rd will pull you on to 80 mph.  The engine is also great for going up hills, especially in 3rd.  The Escort is both great at cruising down the freeway, or just going down the pub and back, it really is a versatile car that handles anything that is put in it's way.

I also love the exterior shape of the Escort, it's smooth curves and chunky rear give it quite a sporty look, while at the same time, the lowish suspension gives a sporty feel while on the road.  The interior isn't bad either, although it is mostly plastic, it has a nice effect on the car's feel, and the steering wheel is good quality as well.   Another great thing about this car is the ICE, although it is only a standard Ford 2001 RDS, it really has no trouble is pumping out the bass notes, and it has loads of handy features such as the option of it telling you when the next traffic report will be on.

The only thing that I hate about this car is that the suspension is quite bad, after the first year of having it, the rear shocks where creaking quite badly, and so were the front ones.  However, after taking this to my local Ford dealer, they replaced the shocks with some newer Escort style ones, and they have been fine.  Other down points are that when you really do push the engine hard, it becomes quite uneconomical.  I calculated that at one point, I was only doing 20 mpg.  This can be easily solved, however, by cruising around in 4th and 5th as much as possible.  I can normally cruise around at 35 mph in 5th, and she doesn't really mind.

The Ford Escort would make an ideal family car, for the family that also likes quite a bit of fun at the same time.  They are reliable, quite cheap on the gas and the parts are easil available too.  It is also the ideal car for the person that has just passed their test.  The engine isn't so large that they can loose their license in 1st gear, but it does have enough punch to sound sporty to show off to friends.
