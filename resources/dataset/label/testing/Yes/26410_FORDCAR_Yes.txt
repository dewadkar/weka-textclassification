            I bought a 1996 Ford Windstar GL last August and I absolutely love it. Not to mention the fact that I am only 23 years old! This may seen odd to you reading this but I have 2 German Shepherds I take training twice a week! 
I needed something with more room and originally I was going to buy an SUV. I wanted something that rode a little nicer. I had always liked the look of the Ford Windstar. 
I narrowed my search down to a Dodge Caravan or a Ford Windstar. Although the Caravan rode just a bit nicer, I chose the Windstar because of the room. 
I took my dad with me and what I wanted was the dog crates to fit behind the second seat in case I ever had more than one passenger. We looked at a Dodge Caravan and measured behind the back seat and they would not fit. Then, we looked at a Windstar and I could tell that they would fit right away.
A 1995 Windstar was in my price range but I did my homework and read all over the internet about the problems others were having with the 1995's. I tightened my belt a little bit and bought a 1996. 
I was very happy with the room. I also liked the handling. Even my dad made the comment that it handles like a car. You don't even realize that it is a huge van. 
I really like (and so do my dogs) the rear air conditioning. With all that room, you really do need a separate air conditioner in the back. I think they should consider it a &quot;van&quot; and not a &quot;mini-van.&quot; 
I did have one problem with the Third door. It wasn't making contact when the door closed so the power door lock would not work. I took it to my Ford Dealer and they installed a new contact with no problem. As a matter of fact, I am ordering a rear spoiler and taillight covers for it! (Hey, I'm 23...what did you expect?)
I would recommend this &quot;van&quot; to anyone. I really love it and I would buy another one for sure!<br><br>
