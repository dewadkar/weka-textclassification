            To me Nikon has become synonymous with cameras, the company has trully set the bar for quality, and now they present a series of digital cameras.
The Nikon CoolPix 950 presents some trully great features like autofocus control, high speed continuoous shooting, great color displays.  Images can be saved as a variety of different files.  The Liquid Crystal Display allows for instant viewing of shots that were just taken.  The variety of lenses alows for a great variety of pictures being taken, and you can store them all in the camera, up to about 200.  The price for this little jewel is quite steep, about 900 dollars, but the quality this product presents is well worth the price.<br><br>
