            I brought the Agfa ePhoto 1680 to replace my big Sony Mavica MV-FD8 that I had for about 6 months. I did not like the resolution of 640x480, so I did research on a new one for about two months before I settle on the ePhoto 1680. The choices that I had down to were Agfa, Kodak DC260, and Nikon coolpix 950. All three had very similar feature, but I settle for the Agfa, because it was a little cheaper than the other two.

Now, that I had the 1680 for more than 6 months, I had really enjoy it, the layout of the camera is very simple. I only read the manual a few times for some clarification, other than that, the camera is user-friendly.

My biggest complain that I had is the short battery life, I would suggest buying a set of nicad batteries for it and use the charger that comes with it.

I am very happy using it.<br><br>
