            My second car, which I am still currently driving, is a 1991 Chevrolet Lumina Euro. We bought the car because my previous car was constantly breaking down, and my parents decided that I deserved a reward for being embarrased time after another while stranded on the side of a road. 
My first impression of the four-door sweetie was wonderful. She's little, compact, and even half sporty looking with a spoiler on her trunk. The first time I drove, it was a bit shaky since I was used to the enourmous amount of play in an older vehicle. The steering is very sensitive and hard to get used to immediately. It's nice having all the automatic controls is one spot on the door, but I had a problem with storage. The glove box is tinier than my liking, and I had to purchase a drinkholder/tape storer in order to have my organization. The trunk is plenty big to fit my eighty JC Penneys bags, so that part is satisfactory.
The only other thing I am concerned about is that the brakes are already wearing out. We are planning on purchasing new brakepads, but it's rather scary when I have to brake suddenly. Overall, she's a sweet car and very dependable.
