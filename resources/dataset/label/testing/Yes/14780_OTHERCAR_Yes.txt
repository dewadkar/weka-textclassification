            I bought the Volkswagon Fox when I was still in college. I drove it through the treacherous winters of Massachusetts. It took a beating in the snow and ice like a trooper. 

I can't tell you how many times my boyfriend and I would have to take MY car out in the cold because his newer (much more expensive) Honda Accord was frozen and wouldn't start. (Ha! I loved that.) Volkswagons do tend to have issues with the fuel line freezing in the winter though, so you have to make sure you always have at least a 1/4 tank of gas. Actually, the Fox drives better in snow than in rain. It did some hydroplaning in the rain - it's a light car. 

I learned to drive a stick on this car. I loved the clutch because it was pretty stiff and easy to learn how to feel when it kicked in. The rack and pinion steering was a little tough though - definitely not easy to drive with the morning cup of coffee. 

I drove the Fox for over 5 years and never had any problems - just the usual change of tires, tune-ups and oil changes. It was the perfect combination of new and low maintenance, inexpensive (I was waiting tables), and safe (My Mom approved).

I would definitely recommend it to a young person on a budget because you get the Volkswagon engine in a less expensive car.<br><br>
