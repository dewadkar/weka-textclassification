            When I was sixteen, my folks bought me my first car.  It was a used Grand Torino...a real piece of junk!  Never stayed out of the shop for more than 2-months at a stretch.  My second car was a new Chevy Cavalier Z-28. Let's just say that after the initial 6-months, the shake,rattle and roll was so bad that I took my girlfriend out in my parents cars or not at all. My brother went through four American cars and hated each one with increased passion.  So...I became a foreign car enthusiast. I am 31 now and have gone through a BMW and two Toyota 4-Runners since my last American car nightmare. I never...ever...ever had a major problem with any of my foreign cars!  In February, 1999, I was in the market for a new SUV type of vehicle.  I tested the Lexus, 4-Runner, Montero, Explorer, Pathfinder and Rodeo.  Based on ride quality, price, accessories, warranty and service reliability...I chose the FORD EXPLORER over the Lexus.  I did so with great trepidation!  But, I am very proud to report that my fully loaded 99' Explorer Sport 4.0, is one of the best all-around vehicles that I have ever driven.  The ride quality is smooth and nimble, the engine is strong and responsive, the interior is very comfortable and has maintained it's initial quality.  I am 5'11 and my wife is 5'8. We fit in the front or rear without any problems. However, people over 6'1 seem to feel cramped - front and rear. The gas mileage is moderate...be prepared to stop for gas at least once per week (in the 4-Runner, it seemed like much less?). Overall, I love the FORD. I don't mind the 2-doors of the Sport model but, if this was my only, daily driver...I would opt for 4-doors. I have also been very impressed with my dealers service center. I have a 1998 BMW and the service center at my Ford dealer is equal in all areas.  I will update my Explorer report again in one year.  So far...thanks to Ford for renewing my faith in American vehicles.      <br><br>
