            I bought my Aspire new in 1995.  I now have close to 120,000 miles and have never had a problem.  I don't even get the oil changed when I should.  I've changed brake pads once and replaced the spark plugs around 70,000 miles...and oh yeah, the battery is about 3 years old.  I take it on long road trips with no problems.  The gas mileage is great and it has more power than you would think!  My car is a five speed, so this probably helps with power.  Two summers ago, I was on a road trip and was a bit worried about driving through the Rocky Mountains.  I was going to go hundreds of miles out of my way to avoid it, but decided to try it anyway.  My little Aspire was passing SUV's left and right!  It smoked them!  
I was in a 6 car pile up 5 years ago with 4 of the cars hitting me.  My car looked like a cracker box that had rolled down a hill.  After a week in the shop it came out.  Usually wrecked cars never perform the same, but not my Aspire.  It ran just as good as before.  
I do not have a problem with it shaking when it reaches high speeds, but then again, I'm smart enough to know when my tires are out of balance, so when it does shake a quick trip to the tire store to get them balanced (free with my tire warranty) solves the car shake.
About 3 years ago, when I started road tripping, I decided to rip out the back seat and build a bed system.  My friends called me nuts, said it would never work.  But, now all I have to do when I want to sleep is push the seats forward, extend my bed system, and there is more than enough room for me, one other adult, and my black lab.  Yes, we can all sleep in the back with plenty of room to stretch out!
I love my car!  Who cares if it looks like a clown car!  It runs better than most cars half it's age out there!
I recently started looking for a new car.  I thought my car needed to retire because it had high miles, not because of it's performance.  Of course I started searching ads for other Aspires out there with fewer miles.  I only found a few Aspires for sale and many of them had over 170,000 miles on them.  I would have never guessed an Aspire would last 170,000 miles!  So, I've decided to keep my car for awhile longer now that I know it will run that much longer!
