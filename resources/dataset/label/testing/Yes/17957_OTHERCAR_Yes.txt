            The jeep wrangler, with its heritage of rough riding and leaking tops  have come a long way. I use to own a 1974 jeep cj5 so i was eager to judge  the new breed of jeeps. My wrangler , a sport model with extras on it to bring it up to the standard sahara package minus the color matched wheel guards. I stayed with the standard transmission instead of opting for automatic(besides whats a jeep with no manual shift on the floor).The automatic transmission offered being only a 3-speed was a bit out of date for me even if i wanted it. The 5 speed manual transmission shifts well, all tho first gear being quite low made for jerky startups  going from first to second. Once going , the jeep jumps with plenty of on road power  to keep up with the big boys.Highway driving with the standard cloth top is somewhat noisy but nothing compaired to my 1974 cj5 soft top. the ease of use cloth top is a very tight fit minimizing the flapping noise from the wind.On  the road street driving ,noise....very little.optional hard top now is a different story  very quiet highway driving, only noise you get is with the engine reeved up  wanting to be put in to a quieter easier 6th gear(maybe that will come in the near future).Sound system with the optional sound bar makes hearing the radio, tape or cd very pleasent  tho could use better speakers as there is very little bass in the speakers.The wrangler with  its new coil springs is a vast improvement over the old leaf spring system  but remember this still is a jeep.You want something that rides in pure luxury well you better  start looking at the high priced big models.The wrangler is still a tough jeep off  road as it always has been , its just got alot of more creature comforts to satisfiy us comfort minded people.The Jeep Wrangler is mostly a young persons type vehicle unless you need something very compant for off road then  its everybodies jeep. But if you are like me  in my 40's and my second child hood, the jeeps the original and the way to go. As for engines  the way to go is the current 6 banger  to keep  the noise down and power exceptional.<br><br>
