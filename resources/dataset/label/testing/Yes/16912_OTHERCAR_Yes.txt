            <b>Why the Outback?</b>
Subaru has made the 2000 Outback a roomy, sporty, and well-priced alternative to SUVs.  When it came time to get rid of our 1993 Ford Escort wagon, we wanted something more reliable and with a roomier back seat.  After looking at offerings from Volvo, Audi, and the few other station wagon manufactures, the Outback was a clear choice.  It�s the only wagon priced in the low twenties to have all-wheel-drive, and comes with a host of standard features, such as power everything, four-wheel disc brakes, tape deck, roof rack, AC, etc.  Our model also has a CD player, basic security system, and the �cold weather package,� which includes heated front seats, heated mirrors, rear-slip differential (front-slip is standard), and windshield wiper de-icer.  

<b>Favorite Aspects</b>
What we love the most about the Outback is the overall comfort of the ride.  The suspension is remarkably smooth, and both the front and rear seats are well designed.  The rear seats have 34 inches of legroom, which was more than enough to keep two 6�3� friends comfortable during a four-hour drive.  The 7.3 inches of ground clearance make riding over speed bumps, uneven pavement, and snowy driveways worry-free.  
  
<b>New in 2000</b>
Subaru redesigned the Outback for 2000 to address some of the complaints of previous models, such as the cup-holders, which used to be awkwardly placed behind the stick-shift.  For 2000, they put a large cup-holder�which holds a 32 oz drink�next to the emergency brake for the driver.  A smaller cup-holder pops out of the dashboard for the passenger.  Another complaint was the lack of engine power.  The 4-cylinder 2.5L boxer engine kicks out 165 hp, which we find has no problem getting a full load up hills (at least with the 5-speed transmission).  We understand that Subaru is planning on offering a 6-cylinder engine on future models.

<b>Minor Gripes</b>
What don�t we like about the Outback?  First, it�s supposed to get 23 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway.  Even without using the AC or making quick starts, we�ve only been getting 21/25.  Second, the rear wiper squeaks fairly loudly when used (the dealer told us it was a faulty motor, but even after replacement the noise persists).  Finally, only the Limited has seat-back map pockets and a passenger-side vanity mirror (our model has a vanity mirror for the driver).  People won't upgrade to the Limited for the map pockets, so they should be standard, and we�d rather have the passenger fix their hair while the driver watches the road.  

<b>Recommendation</b>
Overall, we feel the Outback is a great car, and well worth the relatively low price.  Subaru wagons have also been holding their value very well, so the resale value should be high.  If you�re looking for a roomy car with all-wheel-drive and don�t want an SUV, we highly recommend the 2000 Outback!
