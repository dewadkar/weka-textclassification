            We got a Chevy Cavalier when my husband and I were first married after my little unreliable excel died and we could no longer afford to put more money into it.  We bought ours in South Dakota and I was kind of worried about how it would take the winter months there.  But it proved how reliable it really was.  We had no problems what so ever.  It never failed to start in the below zero tempertures and we never had any problems driving in the snow and on the icy roads. Maintenance was low cost if you kept up on them.  This was a great little car that I trusted with the safety of my family which included a new baby girl at that time.<br><br>
