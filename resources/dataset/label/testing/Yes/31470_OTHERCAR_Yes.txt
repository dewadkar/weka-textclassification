            We had a Sears store going out of business so I was in the market for a digital camera and this is the one I bought. I paid about $200 for it, which I thought was a pretty good deal.
This camera takes some pretty good pictures, but the lighting has to be just right. The flash doesn't seem to work every time that I feel it is needed. The camera is easy to use, I never owned one before so that helped me. I used it for a little while before I finally realized that I needed to buy a compact flash card. I bought a 64 mb card and it has plenty of space for pictures. The camera also has a 2x zoom which is nice to get a little closer picture, it also has a self timer which I like. The view finder on the back of the camera is a nice size, considering the size of the camera and gives pretty good detail of the pictures. One of my favorite things that come with the camera is the software. It is a snap to download the pictures and to print them. (GREAT SOFTWARE)

The things I don't like are,
1. That the shutter speed is slow.
2. No lens cover, you really need to keep it in a case.
3. Some of the pictures turn out real grainy. If they do, you can delete them simply, and then retake the picture.
4. The batteries run out quickly.

All in all I still like the camera. It takes pretty good pictures and it is small and light weight. Don't forget the great software.
