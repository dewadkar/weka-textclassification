            From a totally superficial standpoint, the 2001 Mercury was a great choice for me. I chose the metallic red and opted for the sun and sound and sport packages (i think that's what they're called). We'll start with the interior.... All of the dashboard stuff is trimmed in chrome. The pedals and a footrest are as well. The little air conditioning vents are so cool looking...they're round and kinda look like peace signs. The seats are comfortable and can be adjusted a whole bunch of ways (up or down, tilted backwards or forwards, etc). I also love the armrest. I drive an automatic, but regardless, the armrest console thingy is great. I have the 6-cd changer in it. It sounds great. There are speakers all over the car which allow me to roll the automatic windows down and open my automatic sunroof and just jam. There are all kinds of cool features-- digital speed, miles till empty, mileage, temperature. There are also freezing weather warnings, and cool stuff like that. The only problem is the back seat-- very small. Its hard to fit people back there. But hey, I bought a sporty car for looks, not to drive a family around. 
   Now for the exterior. The color is fabulous. I get so many compliments on the color and styling of my Cougar. Guys check me out (usually 16 year old boys. i'm 19..., but that's okay). Anyway, people also tell me about my rims. Which I have no clue about. But I guess they're nice considering how many compliments I've gotten. The car has a back windshield wiper (or whatever), which is quite beneficial. 
   I have owned the car for about 6 months now. I haven't had any problems with it thus far.
   I love my Cougar and wouldn't trade it for anything. It's a young or single people's kind of car-- not to a soccer mom's advantage.
