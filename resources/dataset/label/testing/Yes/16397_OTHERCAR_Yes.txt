            I bought my Volvo wagon from an old man who couldn't figure out what a young, single guy like me would want with a dull Volvo wagon.  I was touring with the Grateful Dead so the wagons space and comfort were my main draws but I also remembered the commercials touting the turbo Volvos ability to beat Porsche 944's of the day from 0-60mph.  It was a fast car and I never found myself wanting more power.  It was good on gas and a dream to drive on the highways cris-crossing America following the band.  I had a four speed manual with an electronic overdrive button that worked like a dream and it was a pretty neat little feature.  It ran beautifully and aside from replacing the harmonic balancer (a job I knew had to be done when I bought the car), it ran wonderfully for me over thousands of miles.  I did little more than change the oil and fill it up with gas.  I'm sure the car would have run forever had I not been rear-ended on PCH in southern CA one fateful day and may I say that the Honda which hit me was mashed almost unrecognizeably while my Volvo escaped with little more than a dented bumper.  I nevertheless decided to donate it following the incident, a decision I have come to regret.  Although I love my '87 Maxima, (the car I bought following the Volvo: see my review of it here as well), it does not have the personality and quirkiness of my  Volvo wagon.  A great car to own and drive.
