            I bought my jeep used from someone who had leased it for only a year.  I got a good deal b/c it was used and she had had to keep the mileage down.  I really like driving it in the snow and I *love* it with the top down in the summer on the way to the beach.

Here are a few of my rude awakenings over the year that I have owned it:
1.  The manufacturer's radio is horrible, as are the speakers, but I have not made the investment in a good stereo system yet.  This is in direct response to:

2.  There is no security for &quot;stuff&quot; in this vehicle.  Everything I take in, I must take out.  I am very concerned about putting in a CD player or even a tape deck for that matter.  With the soft top on, there is really no reason to even lock the doors, b/c if somebody wants something, the vinyl cover is no deterrent.

3.  It is LOUD.  The hard top provides some sound absorption, but the soft top--forget it.  And with the top down, you enjoy the wind in your hair and have to be satisfied with just sitting next to your friend, not actually talking to him.  Notice those commercials you see on TV never show people smiling and having conversation like family car commercials do.

4.  In this gas crunch, I have been opting for public transportation b/c the Wrangler is a guzzler with 15 gallon tank (=$24 to fill it!)

This having been said, I will probably buy a cheap tape deck and plug a portable CD player and I cannot wait to take the top down even if it means riding around with layers for the next few weeks.  It is really a fun fun car to drive and I won't give it up until I have a baby!<br><br>
