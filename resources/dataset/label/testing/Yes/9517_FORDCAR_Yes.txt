            I bought this V6 car a year old in 96 at 12K miles in Tallahassee, FL. I was told it was a lease, I think it was a rental as the remotes were still in the plastic. However, I read in Consumer Affairs that rentals were good buys. 

About a year later the AC went; under warranty so that saved me over $300 but still cost me a trip to the dealer. I also had problems with the radio. I also took it in 3 times to fix a rattle, which never was cured!

Right before my manufacturer's 3-yr/36K warranty was about to expire I noticed the white convertible top has started wearing. At first I thought it was just dirty (car was kept outside at the time) but when I realized it was wearing I brought it to the dealer and they replaced the top with no qualms. The new top was only exposed to being outside for a year and has spent the last 4 years in a garage and hasn't been wearing as bad, but it does have 2 small holes (not bad enough to leak).

Around 50K the torque converter HAD to be replaced which would have cost me @ $700 instead of $109 under extended warranty. 

The car now has 78K on it and no problems since. In fact, I just replaced the battery for the first time! 

Like any convertible it has a rattle, but just the one! The wind doesn't whistle through the top until you get up near 80 mph. The top is easy to put up & down. Rain does not get in, but watch out for the drive-thru car wash (My Jag is the same way, so I guess it's a convertible thing)! The ride is comfortable for a sports car, not hard. However, it doesn't hug the road either! The seats are VERY soft, like a sofa. I used to drive this car on 450-mile road trips 4 times a month with no problems. Gas mileage is about 28-29 HWY if you keep up with the maintenance.

The insurance is high because this car does not do well in accidents. The Trams Am is better in that area.

I have been shopping for a new car. I drove a Spyder, which handled nice, but very little room (and I&#146m only 5&#146 5&#148 & 120) and almost no trunk or backseat. The Spyder, Sebring, Firebird & TransAm are overpriced comparatively to the Mustang. 

I get compliments on my car all the time and people can't believe it's 6 yrs old. I've had 3 cars with T-tops, after having a convertible I'll never go back to T-tops. If you have been debating about getting a convertible, do it! Every free spirit should own one!

Update 2/02 Sold for $5500 @ 89K & EVERYTHING still works & I got a ton of calls on this car. Bought a 97 Convt Jag. If I hadn't had the money for a Jag, I would have bought another Mustang.

Update 2/03 - The new owner LOVES the car!
