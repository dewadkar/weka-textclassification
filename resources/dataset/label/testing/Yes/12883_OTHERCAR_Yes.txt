     My first digital camera was a loaner I used for a week, back in late 1995. It was ghastly; its maximum resolution was below 640 x 480. It was more a novelty than anything else. A few years later I bought a Canon 500; at 640 x 480 resolution (maximum); it showed the potential for digital photography. Just two months ago, I bought a refurbished Olympus D-370 (cousin to the D-340R), at a great price, $140. That included software, an 8 MB memory card, the first battery pack, and a 90-day warranty. I've been very happy with it since. 

Resolution of this camera is 1.3 megapixels, enough to take pictures at a maximum resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels. At that resolution, you get great 3" x 5" prints, and the pictures even take enlargement well to about 2.5x, big enough for just about any ordinary recreational or business use. There are four resolutions to which you can set the camera (including 1280 x 960), and even with the highest resolution, the included 8 MB memory card will hold about 24 pictures, about the same as a roll of film. If you're happy with the lowest setting, 640 x 480, then you'll be able to store almost 60 pictures. For me, that makes buying a larger memory card unnecessary. 

Like any modern camera, shutter speed is adjusted automatically, as is the lens focus, from infinity to about 2 feet. A close-up setting (a switch on the front of the camera) allows you to take pictures from 2 feet to 10 inches (as per the instruction manual). However, I've found I can take pictures that range from acceptable to good, depending on the object, as close at two inches. That's true even for small objects, like rings, coins, and stamps, which is important for the objects I auction on E-Bay. 

Speaking of E-Bay, since buying the camera I've auctioned dozens of items with their pictures, mostly eliminating my using a scanner to make pictures of things. Still, I've found a hang up or two with pictures I've taken with the D-370. If you use an older computer, or have a "slow" connection or modem, in the 28K - 56K range, then you'll likely be limited to uploading pictures of 100K - 150K size to E-Bay. That's not a lot of detail, so the pictures will almost always be at 640 x 480 resolution. If you want to upload detailed, as in multi-megabyte pictures (taken at the camera's maximum resolution), then you'll need a cable connection. Thus, I can easily upload a 3-4 MB picture at work (don't tell anybody), but not at home. 

One thing I appreciate about the Olympus D-370 is the colors are very true, and well saturated. Objects in the pictures have the same colors as they do to the naked eye, and they are nice and bright; none of the pale, faded, "pastel" colors I saw with earlier digital cameras. The same applies to the pictures as seen on either the camera's monitor, or when the pictures are exported to a computer for viewing. 

Battery life is a weak point, though that's something I've known since my first digital camera; they all gobble batteries. Though the D-370 came with its first battery pack, 4 lithium-ion batteries, they were quickly drained. In fact, I found alkaline batteries last somewhat longer. While you can get an A/C connector for the Olympus D-370, it's an extra cost option. A good alternative to buying batteries might be rechargeable ones, but you'll need to buy a battery charger too if you don't have one. And rechargeable batteries aren't cheap; the camera takes 4 AA batteries, and you'll need 8 of them total, one set to use, and one set to charge as a backup. The 8 batteries could easily cost $25-$30. 

The documentation? Don't be fooled; it looks like a lot more than it is. You get several fairly thick booklets, but they are only that big because everything is printed a half-dozen times over, once in English, and another five times in other languages. The documentation is enough to get you started, but that's about all. Fortunately, the camera commands are very easy to learn. 

The Olympus D-370 has a lot more positive than negative points, and even though it's no longer at the front of the pack for consumer cameras, it is a very useful and practical camera at a great price.
