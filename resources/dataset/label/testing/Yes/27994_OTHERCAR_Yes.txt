            After testing Toyota Avalon and Volvo S-80, I found a better deal and I think a better vehicle in the A-6.  It is distinctive in every way, and loaded with very clever computer functions and luxury touches I haven't seen &quot;all in one car&quot;. This is the vehicle of the future, amazing Quattro drive feels good all the time, and high speed driving is very quiet and impressive.  Rides better than my previous Olds and Caddys. The fold down back seat works very easily and gives massive space, very useful.  The Bose audio system is awesome, with tweeters up high in the door for very balanced sound front and rear.  The sub woofers really do the job -- and the CD changer works flawlessly.  This is truly a concert sound system, not a stereo radio.  No others I tested came close to this sound.  I have had only satisfaction with both the car and dealer. Fit and finish and choice of materials and design inside this car exceed the Mercedes. This is definitely a product for people who love cars, but want a car that works well, and doesn't need a lot of maintenence.<br><br>
