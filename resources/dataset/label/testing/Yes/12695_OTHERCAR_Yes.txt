            We have found our 1997 Cavalier to be a very good car.  In the past 2 1/2 years, we have traveled over 12,000 miles without any problems whatsoever!  The car offers great gas mileage and a smooth ride.  Safety features include dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.  Keyless Remote is a welcome option to add! The seats are not as comfortable as some, but plenty comfy for a long trip (unless you are a large sized individual)  The back seat is roomy, though with two car seats installed it becomes small quickly!  This is not the best car for a growing family, but for an established one, it proves to be a great car for your money!<br><br>
