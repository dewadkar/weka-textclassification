            This car is expensive but it's really reliable and comfortable. who owned this car need to take care of it really nicely cause of the cost. I test drove it like couple weeks ago and I like it really much. I'm going to buy it like next year or so cause I need to safe some money. The feature on it are so nice and so much to do with it. all wheels drive system and leather sit so comfortable. I want a white one so hopefully they do have it. ok I'm going to jet now so I will be back write more.<br><br>
