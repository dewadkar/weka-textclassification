            As Volvo moves in to the 21st century I think that they have been making strides to get away from the Idea that the Volvo is nothing more than a reliable box on wheels that will keep you safe. I believe that the 850's were the first to really start moving away from the old boxes. This is not to say that the 93 850 is by any means as sporty or stylish as a Jaguar but it in not just a box. 
	I have owned mine now for a little over two years and I have had very few problem with it. I bought it in the spring of 1998 and it had about 46k miles on it. Since then I have about doubled those miles on it with little or no problems. Besides normal maintenance all I have had to do is replace a faulty switch that was causing the Gears of the Automatic transmission to slip. Minor repair for a minor problem. So all in all I have found it to be a good reliable car
	In terms of comfort it is incredible. The heated leather seats hold you in and provide all the comfort anyone could want. Being in the South I am in constant need of the AC and it has always been there for me no matter how hot it gets. The stock sound system is more than adequate and upgrade is easy if one would so desire to do so. 
	I have only one complaints about the car.  No cup holders. Now this might seems pretty minor when buying the car, but in functionality in say to day life it is a huge deal. I believe that Volvo has corrected this problem in their newer cars.
	Pretty much as the title states the 93 850 is everything anyone could expect from a Volvo with a little sport thrown in to make it fun.
