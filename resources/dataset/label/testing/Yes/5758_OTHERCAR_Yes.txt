            I bought a one-owner 1992 Mitsubishi Mighty Max p/u from a Lincoln Dealer in Ann Arbor back in 1999, and am still driving it today (4/2002) with over 170K miles on it.  I have done all of my own maintenance on the truck, except for one front-end repair/alignment, and a few oil changes. In three years of owning the truck, I've put over 120K miles on it, 90% of them being highway miles driving to/from my place of employment.  

As with any vehicle, this truck has had its "pros" and "cons".  The pros have been: gas mileage (24-26 highway), reasonable cost of repair parts (brakes, alternator, radiator, etc.), and a ruggedly built chassis that will actually haul its rated weight capacity (6-bolt axles, heavy frame and springs).  It also has a great heater that blows hot in about 5 minutes on the coldest winter days, and relatively good traction through the snow without using any "ballast", if good all-season radials are kept on the back.

The cons have been Maintenance Issues.  Primarily, my biggest complaint is that these trucks have a poorly designed clutch disc.  At 30-40K miles (or 18 months) like clockwork, my clutch fails.   To me, it appears to be a poor design, and one that I've found several "aftermarket" vendors have done nothing to correct.  The center hub of the clutch contains four small coil springs--shock absorbers.  These springs are held in place (captured) not with holders, but by thin sheet metal.  And after 30-40K miles of driving, these springs wear right through the sheet metal and fall out.  If you buy a model with a 5-speed, plan on doing at least one clutch job while you have it.

My other concerns with the truck have been with the following--1. Defective ECU's ($350--bought a repaired unit), 2. Expensive air filter (for 4cyl/2.4L it's $20--I see others similar size at store for $3!), and 3. Hardly any grease fittings on the front-end, none on stock u-joints (typical).  I did install fittings myself on the upper/lower ball joints as they had removable plugs, but there are hardly any on the steering linkage. 

The truck as a whole, however, has done well for me, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an economical ride to work, and who is capable of doing their own maintenance.
