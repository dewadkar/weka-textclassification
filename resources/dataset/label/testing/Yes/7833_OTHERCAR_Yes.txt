            A few weekends ago, a friend of mine and I decided to kill time by browsing at our local Carmax.  I had no immediate plans to purchase a vehicle, but I always like to window shop.  

After deciding that a 1997 Nissan truck was too good a deal to pass up, we gathered up another friend for a third opinion before "doing the deal."  A curled upper lip and a raised eyebrow were the reaction to the Nissan, so we decided to cruise through the lot once more.  And there it was.  A silver-grey and black 1997 Isuzu Rodeo--42,000 miles and very reasonably priced.  A test drive later, it was mine.  

EXTERIOR

The Isuzu Rodeo, and its corporate twin, the Honda Passport, are (to some) a little long in the tooth when it comes to exterior panache.  True--the first generation of these body styles is a bit boxy. But when I purchase a truck or sports-ute, I find that a desirable quality.  I prefer to think of the Rodeo as rugged rather than dated.  

INTERIOR

The Rodeo I bought was the bottom-of-the-line.  Roll down windows, no cruise control, and a rather spartan interior.  Again, these are things which might not appeal to most buyers but are just what I look for in a truck purchase.  Space was great.  The front seats were quite comfortable, and the back seat allowed passengers to stretch out.  The upholstery was plain and durable--I imagine it would take years for it to show any wear.  The carpet, even on the four year old model I purchased, was still like new.  The gauges were large and sensibly arranged--with all controls within an easy reach from both front seats.  The stock stereo system was quite good--with the rear speakers mounted on the roof of the cargo area so they really infiltrated the cabin.

DRIVING THE RODEO

The 4x2, four-cylinder, 5-speed manual model I bought had me a bit worried at first.  I drove a friend's Toyota Rav-4 on many occasions and found it to be underpowered.  I reasoned that a 4-banger in a much larger car would get me up a hill at speeds that would make a grandmother curse.  To my surprise, the car had admirable power--pulling to cruising speed quickly, with no noticable lag on grades.  I wouldn't recommend the four cylinder mated with an automatic, nor would I call upon it to tow anything, but for everyday driving, it delivered plenty.  For the most part, the manual gearbox was smooth and easy.  

On bumps and rough roads--the Rodeo again performed just as I like.  Not smooth like a luxury car, but not a hay wagon either.  You felt the road, but didn't get jostled too harshly.

WHY I RETURNED THE RODEO

Other than the fact that it was the most extravagant sort of impulse buy, the Rodeo didn't meet my expectations in cold weather.   A few days after buying it, temperatures dipped into the low twenties.  The Rodeo was no happier about the climate than I was.  I had to grind the transmission to find a gear, when I turned it off, it sputtered like 30 year old Buick, and a strange THUMP THUMP THUMP developed in sharp turns.  By evening, when the weather warmed, it was fine again--but I wasnt going to take the chance.  With mixed feelings, I returned it to Carmax.
