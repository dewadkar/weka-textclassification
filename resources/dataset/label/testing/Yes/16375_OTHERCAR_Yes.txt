            When I bought this camera is was mainly because it was the cheaper one and it was Hewlett Packard, which matches my computer. Since I've had this camera I'm glad that I didn't get a different kind because this camera works great. It takes nice pictures and it's quick and easy to download them on to the computer to print or send them through email. This camera was a great price. I was kind of uneasy about buying a digital camera but after getting this It was probably the best thing that I've gotten for my computer. I was easy to install and even easier to get started using this camera. This is also many &quot;expanding possibilities&quot; on this camera. You can get different lens for it. For example you can get Super Close-up Lens, Telephoto Lens, Wide Angle Lens, Polarizer Lens, UV Protection Lens, Star Filter Lens, and many other kinds, depending on what your needs are. With this camera, as long as you have a printer, computer and paper to go along with this camera you'll never need to or want to go and get pictures developed again.<br><br>
