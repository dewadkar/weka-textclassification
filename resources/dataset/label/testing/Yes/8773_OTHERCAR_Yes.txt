            I bought my 1990 s-10 blazer over 3 years ago. It had 75,000 miles on it when I bought it. The 4.3 liter was very strong and had alot of pick-up. (more than the 2.8 I had been used to.) After almost 100,000 miles the engine is still strong as when I bought it. I can't say that I have never had any problems. About a year after I bought it I had problems with the engine cutting out periodically. I replaced many sensors and dropped close to $300.00, but never did find out what the actual problem was. It just stopped for some reason. My blazer is a 5-speed manual transmission, which has treated me very well. I have never done any work on it, but there seems to be some wear in the driveline, because it goes through u-joints faster than normal. Overall the mechanical working has been good, but the body has been going done hill pretty quick.

In the last year the body has been rusting pretty fast and I have had to fix some holes and replace a rear quarter panel. I am not sure if I will be able to keep up with it or not. And I do not want to spend the money to get it done.

I drive 35 miles to work every day, and in the last year I have been able to count on the blazer to get me there and back. Overall I feel that the blazer has performed well and met my expectations.
