            I have now owned this car for just over 3 years and 75k miles.
It has only been in the shop for oil changes and very little routine maint.
This is the first "old-man's car" I have ever owned but I must say I am impressed with the overall quality, performance & price.
New I paid just over $25k out the door (INCLUDING 6% sales tax, tags and all that other stuff they hit you up with). 
I test drove everything under the sun before I bought this car. I liked the Audi A4 2.8 better but it was almost $10k more similarly equipped. This was hands down the best 200 horsepower car I could find for my money.
About the only complaint I have is handling. While the ride is smooth the suspension is not firm enough for me. This makes the car less fun to drive than some of the German competitors, but reliability and price more than make up for it.
Nothing has broken on the car to this point. Great reliability and resale value.

As for service, I'm a little disappointed in my dealer. They try to WAY oversell your service. Their recommended services are way too expensive because they do WAY too much service. Make sure you follow the recommended service in the OWNERS MANUAL and NOT what the dealer tells you. If I did all the service that the dealer recommended my total costs would probably be double what I actually paid for the manufacturer suggested service. These things don't break so the dealership has to make money somehow. Just not off me ;-)

What else...the heated seats are great if you live where it gets cold and the leather seems to be holding up well. The Bose CD player sounds great. Back seat is for small kids or emergency-use only. Its awful tight back there.

All in all a very nice if not overly sporting car.
