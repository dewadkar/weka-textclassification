            I am not an expert by any means but I love this camera. I have put away my old BULKY digital for this LITTLE pentax that I keep in its new case (an Altoids tin! - yes it really is a good case!). 

I narrowed my choices down to the Optio S, the Casio Elixm E3 and the Canon ES400. I thought the Canon was a great camera that took great pictures but was a bit bulky and [costs] more. Just couldn't see spending that since I would not be printing out 8x10's that often (the 4 megapixel camera is better for these large pictures apparently, although the 3.34 should do just fine for the average person like me. I'm sure a photographer will notice the difference but I probably will not). The Casio was a good camera also but I didn't go with it because it uses a PENTAX lens and was a tiny bit bigger. So, why buy the Casio with a Pentax lens when I could buy the Pentax with the Pentax lens.

What I don't like:
1. The biggest complaint I have is that you have to take the battery out to charge it. Plugging the adapter into the camera would have been a better choice.
2. The buttons for scroll through the menu are sooooo small...but a sacrafice I am willing to live with for the size of this camera.
3. The LCD screen could have been a bit bigger. The Casio has a great 2" LCD and it is a considerable difference. Again, willing to sacrafice for a good lens.
4. Movie mode is a pain to get to. You have to go through the menu to get there.
5. Software - it's horrible. Don't even install it. There are other products out on the market so go get one of those.

Things I like:
1. Obviously the size.
2. Picture quality has been great. 
3. Taking pictures at night or even in "total" darkness is very good. Compared to my old digital this is a great feature. 
4. Lots of features that help even people like me take good pictures.
5. SD slot - This was another selling point over the Canon as I have a computer with a built in SD reader and the Canon took a CF card.
6. Battery life has been incredible. I took over 150 pictures before I needed to recharge the battery and had this little guy on for almost 4 hours straight!
7. WOW factor - being a gadgeteer I always love it when peopl say "Wow, what is that!" 

I have owned this camera for 3 weeks now and while I have listed some shortcomings they are by no means any reason NOT to buy this camera. I am just pointing out these things because you should have as much info as you can when making your purchasing decision.
