                    Just after graduating college, moving to a new state and starting a new job, all I needed was a new vehicle.  My parent�s car just wouldn't be feasible any more, especially since they lived over fifty miles away and wanted it back.  It was time to find a mode of transportation of my own.  I had always liked the looks of the Dodge Dakota�s body so I went to a Dodge Dealer and checked them out.


	The first thing that I liked about the truck is the body design.  It is not plain like other pick-ups.  It has some character to it and looks pretty darn sweet to boot.  I have noticed other car companies starting to slowly adopt the Dakota body on their trucks (and we all know what they say the best form of flattery is).  The interior is very roomy even for a 6�1� guy.  I have no problems with any of the controls or locations inside the vehicle.  The dash is nicely laid out and the gauges are easy enough to read (in day or night).  I did not care much for the stock stereo and replaced it, but the speakers are stock and put out nice sound.  There is a six speaker infinity configuration inside that can crank out great sounds at all volumes.


        The middle console is big enough to hold anything (currently I have about 30 CDs � cases and all � inside of mine).  There are three different sized drink holders within easy reach (each looks to be designed for a different default combo-meal drink from the major drive-thru joints).  The back seats are two separate bench seats with three seat belts that fold up to reveal even more storage space (as well as the jack for the emergency situations).  Each side of the back has a cup holder as well.  The only drawback to the back is the lack of leg room for anyone over four feet tall.  I did manage to stuff two six foot tall friends back there for an hour drive and did not hear any complaints (though better them than me).


	The bed of the truck is great.  I have put a sprayed on lining 
inside (which I highly recommend � look for an epinion soon).  I have transported much wood and logs for friends.  The suspension and shocks on the back are designed for this kind of work and seem to enjoy doing it.  I had no problems filling the back up (overflowing) with huge pieces of wood (logs not twigs) and the truck drove like there was nothing there.  I also moved shortly after purchasing and had no problems moving full couches, a queen sized bed, shelving and everything else I owned (all though not in one trip, sad to say).


	The last major plus to this vehicle is the four-wheel drive.  With the four-wheel drive engaged (very easily, I might add, with a simple shifter on the floor) this truck can handle most anything you can throw at it.  I personally have not gone off-roading with it, but with the high ground clearance, big tires, four wheel drive and V8, I do not see much to worry about.  What I have driven in (rain, snow, sleet and ice) it has responded as one would hope.  Starts up from a stop, even on hills, without the slightest slip or fishtail.  As long as you drive within your abilities the four-wheel drive will not fail you.


	There are a few drawbacks to this vehicle.  The major detractor is the amount of money one will put into fuel.  With the Magnum V8, I do not get more than 20 mpg on the highway and only around 12-13 mpg during normal city driving.  With mileage like this I am putting $25 into the 20(plus) gallon tank each week.  Now, if I had a wife and kids this might be more of an issue.  As I am currently loving the single life, this is an issue I can live with.  The other slight drawback is something I think all pick-ups have to deal with.  The lack of traction in the back when the roads are even slightly wet and the four-wheel drive is not engaged.  This is easily remedied by bending forward slightly and engaging the four-wheel drive at any speeds (at least according to the manual).


	Overall, I am quite pleased with my 97 Dodge Dakota.  I have not had any problems with it to present and have only needed to bring it to the dealer for the scheduled tune-ups and oil changes.  The gas mileage could be a sore spot for some people but I bought the truck with that in mind and have no regrets of which to speak.  Anyone that is thinking about getting a truck, get a Dakota.  I did.
