            My mom bought the 93 Camry V6, fully loaded with the gold package, sunroof, cd, etc. at my urging in July of 93.  I'm very thankful that she did.

We were in a serious car accident in August of 1999.  A huge flatbed towtruck (that toes other towtrucks or trucks) smashed into a car behind us which smashed into us which smashed us underneath a dump truck.  Follow that?  Think of being a penny waiting to be pressed.  (SMACK!)  That was us.

Prior to the accident my mother's car was in near perfect condition.  Having bought the extended warranty, we'd only taken the Camry into the shop ONCE due to an antenna problem.  Regular tune-ups and oil changes were all that was needed to keep this car in perfect shape.

So, now the car was mooshed.  Don't get me wrong.  I almost died, so I didn't care about the car during the accident.  But, once everything was over and we were out of the hospital and standing in the autobody shop, we realized just how lucky we were in purchasing this vehicle.

The entire front end was smooshed and squished from being pinned underneath the dump truck.  The windshield was shattered, and the trunk was mooshed in.  The cab of the car, however, was virtually intact.  Crumple zones did what they're designed to do, bending the car in the middle without jeopardizing the integrity of the cab.  I can't tell you  how much that meant to me!

So, if you're looking for a good used car, this is it.  The car handles very well on both the highway, city and country roads.  Here are the most memorable points about the 93 Camry:

UPs:

*   Reliability - We never had any problems with this model outside of a  broken antenna wire.  Not bad for a car of 5 years!

*   Styling - Good interior design, plenty of room to sit comfortably and the material is not cheap looking

*   Audio - Standard speakers work well in this model

*   Safety - Driver's side airback, traction control and anti-lock brakes as well as great crumple zones!

*   V-6  - Superb "getupandgo" for tooling down the freeway or climbing hills


DOWNs:

*   Spendy... it's a Toyota
