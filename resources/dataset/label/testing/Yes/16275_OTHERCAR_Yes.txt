            We bought the Corolla when the lease came up on our Rav4...a bit of a come down  but it was worth it to buy a vehicle rather than lease (different topic...different time)

Overall this is a good car...it equals offerings in the Civic lineup and far surpasses a Sentra.  For a compact car in the Japanese market...certainly a formidable contender.  It is great on gas (especially with the 5spd), has decent acceleration (again with the 5spd), carries 4 adults...2 in comfort and 2 wondering when the hell we are going to get there, and does all things well but nothing spectacular.

I would have to call the car and "appliance".  Works well, keeps on running and doesn't break the bank.  People who buy this vehicle buy it for a number or reasons:

A) Value - It represents decent value for the dollar...take a comparably priced Pontiac Sunfire\Chevrolet Cavalier for a drive and compare the quality.

B) Brand Loyalty - If you are on a budget but still want the Toyota name on the grill...this is your car.  And come on, you have to admit, that little Echo is pretty coyote ugly.

C) Fuel Mileage - few cars can touch this little 4 door miser in terms of mileage.  I got 45 mpg on one trip! 

D) Investment - Take a look at the used marketplace and price out both a Corolla and a Sunfire.  Notice anything? the Sunfire is selling for half the price of the Corolla!

Toyota is releasing a new model in the spring, and I hear it is based on the existing European version.  It is said to have as much room as last year's Camry, more versatility and better performance.  I think Toyota needs this new vehicle to get away from the plain brown wrapper Corolla currently out there...now if they can just keep the damm price down!
