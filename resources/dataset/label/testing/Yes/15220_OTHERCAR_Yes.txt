            I bought this car because my wife wanted the room and versatility of an SUV without the bumpy ride and poor gas mileage.  The Sienna fills the bill to perfection.  It rides like a Camry and is safer than a Volvo!  The gas mileage is good and it is a Toyota, so we expect it to be dependable.

The ride is comfortable and quiet.  Seats with optional lumbar adjustment are very comfortable on long trips.  Rear A/C and power side door are great options.  Third rows seats are easy to fold up or remove.

Anyone one wants the advantages offered by an SUV but doesn't need to drive off road should consider the Sienna.  It is the safest vehicle tested in the Insurance Institute's off-set frontal crash tests.

I love it.<br><br>
