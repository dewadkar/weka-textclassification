            Currently, I am a second hand owner of a 1993 Honda Del Sol Si.  I bought it in 1998, at a Honda dealership in Toronto (Canada) for a little over $10,000 cdn. My puppy (that's what I call it), came with a little over 75,000 km, even though it was 5yrs old at the time.  I got a friend who was a mechanic to come with me to look at the car, and when he said that &quot;nothing looked fishy&quot;, I bought the car.  Let me tell you, the Del Sol is one of the best cars ever made.  The Si version comes with 127Hp, but with it's small body, it feels like your kicking 140 HP. What's even better, is that the 1994(and up) Del Sol V-tec packs a whopping 160 Hp, very similar to the new Civic Si-r. The Del Sol also comes with a removable Targa top, and a retracting rear window that turns it into a stylish convertible. In addition, the racing style seats and raised gearbox makes this car one fun puppy to drive.  You should also remember that this all came standard on my Si version, and I didn't have to modify anything to get this.  But if you are interested in fixing up your car, Honda, as you may already know, has hundreds of after-market modification products. Moreover, any modifications to the performance of a Civic, can usually be done to the Del Sol, because of their similar engines.  So, if you don't have much cash to blow on a car, and you don't want to fall into the Civic niche, then seriously, I suggest you try out a Del Sol. 

There are, however, a couple of drawbacks to a Del Sol, at least with mine of course.  Because the roof is removable, it often squeaks and rattles when I drive. Furthermore, when it rains a lot, water can trickle into the car between the roof and the window. However, at your local Honda dealer, they should be able to fix this problem, because it seems universal on all Del Sols. 
Also, some people may find the two seats to be a little impractical.  It can be at times, but overall I think it's worth it to sacrifice two seats for style.<br><br>
