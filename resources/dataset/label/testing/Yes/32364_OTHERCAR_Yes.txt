            I love my little Jetta.  My husband and I got it 2 years ago (used).  It has a sunroof and the seats are comfortable to sit in.  (At least the front seats are, I can't stand the back seats).  IT's hard to get the car seat in the car sometimes though.  The car gets great gas mileage and has a huge trunk!  IT can fit everything.  We go grocery shopping and have the stroller in the trunk too.  The only problems we've had with it is when we were driving through Kansas, we're not sure what happened, we think it got overheated on the roof, but now our sunroof won't work, and something happened to our interior lights too, but again, it's our fault.  The radio doesn't work either, but only because we won't go get the code put in.  That's kind of a downside because they won't give you the code, but you have to pay 30 dollars for them to fix it, but if the battery gets disconnected again, we'll have to pay again.  

It's a wonderful car for us, but we'll probably have to move on soon.  It's just getting to be too small for our family.
