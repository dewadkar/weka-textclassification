            Since I refuse to bear young I have latched on to my 1993 Chevy S 10. I got this truck from a company auction and it has proven to be a great truck. 

Because it was owned by one of those big old nasty companies it has a TON of miles on it and it still runs great. I have a 5 speed and I think this has added to it's durability.

As far as looks it could use a new paint job but it still looks great.It has given me no real problems other than the usual new muffler and starter but considering what it has been through as far as miles and usage it performs well.
 
The best thing about my truck is that it can go either way it's small and petite enough to be a girl truck but it works like a true Mamma! So if your in the market for a dependable truck go for it!<br><br>
