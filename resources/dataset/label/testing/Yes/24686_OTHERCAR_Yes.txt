            I bought the 2000 Chevy Venture for my family, with two children, and for business, I'm a mobile Disc Jockey.  I love it as far as the smoothness of the ride and the easy schedule of maintenance.  Things are starting to go wrong though.  Minor things.  For one, the automatic door locks do not function for the drivers side sliding door.  Also the handle for the rear door broke already and the rear factory speakers are blown.  These are minor, but the one problem that bothers me the most is when I start the engine, its taking longer and longer to start.  I have a feeling this is only going to get worse.  For the record, I have only owned this vehicle for 3 months now and I bought it brand new.  <br><br>
