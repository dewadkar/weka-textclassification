I purchased this camera several months ago, and was very happy with it for the first while.  

Inside the box one will find the camera, a 16 MB compact flash card, a USB cable, an audio/video cable, and documentation.  The documentation is detailed, and, at least in Europe, in several languages.  To take the first picture, one must simply pop in 4 AA batteries, slide the Compact Flash card into it's slot, and let the camera format the card.  

The layout of the Canon A60 is very nice, and does not take long to get used to.  There are several buttons used to navigate menus, a toggle to switch between shooting and viewing modes, and a wheel to select the shooting mode.  The LCD is very sharp, but hard to see in bright lighting (such as a ski slope).  Also, it seems as though the LCD can get scratched rather easily.

I cannot complain about the images that the A60 produces.  They are crisp and clear.  For me, 2.0 megapixels has been enough, as I have not done any printing of large pictures.  It is nice that the A60 is also quite flexible, and one can easily choose between shutter speeds, shooting modes, and turn the flash on and off.

Movies taken with the A60 have limited resolution, but that can only be expected from a digital.  Videos are recorded and played back in sound.

The bad news is, at least for me, that my beloved Canon did not last.  After about 2 months of use, every time I turned on my camera the lens would not extend properly and it made a horrible clicking sound.  The zoom lens also did not function properly.  I think the camera accidentally being turned on while in its case might have caused the damage.  Anyway, I sent it in and got it repaired for free on warranty, but I don't have as much faith in my canon as I used to.  

Other than my one problem, the Canon A60 seems to be a very good camera.  It is very handy that it uses AAs, which can be bought anywhere.  Battery life is acceptable.  Unfortunately, the A60 does not support USB 2.0, so data transfer is rather slow.  Also, the long shutter lag can be a nuisance when taking action shots.
