            The Canon PowerShot A5 was my third (out of five so far) digital cameras.  I can't say it was the best overall, but it holds a special place in my geek/gadget-loving heart.  It's no fancy, sexy megapixel marvel, but for what I wanted, and for the price, it ruled.

For me the selling point was the size.  It was purchased for use in publishing an independent, alternative, online newspaper, and when it came to getting candid shots or keeping people at ease, the A5 was perfect. Instead of pulling out a bulky, black, Batman-esque moster, making some people recoil in fear, the A5 fit in the palm, and in its life even nabbed a few shots it shouldn't have.

Because it was small, it was also dense, and thus more durable than most.  It isn't the only digicam that fits in a pocket, but it is the only one I've used where I felt comfortable doing so.

The use of the CompactFlash card, which I fit easily into an adapter to slot into my laptop, was another plus.

The A5's successors -- the A50 and above -- improve on the zoom and other little things.  But as a basic model, it was just fine for me.

One of its downsides was, oddly enough, an upside as well to me. Canon suggested use of a proprietary rechargable battery, which was expensive, but I sprung for it anyway. While it made the total cost of the camera much higher, I've yet to use a digital camera whose rechargable battery system came anywhere close to the life provided by Canon's.  Rechargable generic AAs are cheaper, but I have to change them much more frequently.

My A5 was retired not because I wanted a better camera, but because my daughter gave it a bath in the pool.  I might very well still be using it today, otherwise.
