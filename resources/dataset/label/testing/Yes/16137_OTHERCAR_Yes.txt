            We bought a Jeep Cherokee a couple of years back. It was a great vehicle that would take us wherever we wanted to go. It has plenty of back space but could have used some more leg room. The car performed perfectly for many years. However about 6 years into its life, It started to become very unreliable and nobody Would fix the problem We ended up scrapping a vehicle that was never in a wreck. The Jeep also was very difficult to do work on. In the long run, this is a good car and I'm sure that these problems have been corrected.<br><br>
