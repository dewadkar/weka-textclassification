            I bought my 1999 I30t after serious review reading and comparison-shopping.  I choose the I30t over the Acura TL, BMW 3 series, and Lexus ES 300.  For one, the I30 has a great V-6 engine.  It has been awarded the best V-6 engine in class.  The pick-up is very quick, shifting is smooth, and the T model has a sportier suspension that provides a stiffer ride and better handling.  Driving is very smooth, and quiet.  The ride is not as smooth and quiet as in a regular I30, due to a stiffer suspension and wider tires.  

The suspension on the regular I30 is a little softer.  Infiniti provides me with a courtesy car when ever I go in for service, so I have had the opportunity to drive the regular I30.  The ride in comparison is softer, and gives a bit more of a floating feeling.  The I30t hugs the corners better, and the wider tires also give a better grip of the road.  

The transmission shift very smoothly.  The I30t comes with a standard transmission, but I opted for an automatic.  The majority of them I30�s I�ve seen in and out of dealerships have automatics.  My car did develop a �soft� shift between first and second after a while, but I took it to the dealer, and they were able to remedy the problem while I was getting my oil changed.  

I had one flat tire in the car, and it could not be repaired.  The car came with Toyo tires, and at the time I only had about 2000 miles on them.  Finding the same tire was nearly impossible, and when I did it cost more that $200. They are low-profile high-performance tires, so a high cost is expected.  The lack of a full size spare tire is a negative, but the result is a very large and deep trunk.  

The car is full of accessories and amenities.  It comes standard with a Bose stereo system with in dash tape and CD player.  A 6-disk changer is also available, but the dealer wanted $800 so I passed on it.  In case you are considering it, you can get the changer from Infiniti of Scottsdale Arizona (ask for TJ) for about $460, with free shipping.  The sound system is truly the superior of those in the cars I test drove.  The sound is crisp and very clear.  The leather in the car is EXTREMELY comfortable.  I�ve gone from the Bay Area to L.A. three times in the car, and never did I have any complaints about the seats.  There is also a leather wrapped steering wheel and center armrest.  There is wood trim on the side armrests and center consoles.  The car also comes with climate control, with very nicely laid out controls. 

On the outside the T model comes with a spoiler, and better wheels and rims (wider, lower profile), and a different suspension underneath.  The spoiler does have a light in the middle of it.  I really loved the outside of this car, with its aggressive looking stance and beautiful lines.  In my opinion the 2000 model does not look as good as the 1999.

Service is a bit on the expensive side, but average when compared to other luxury cars.  The I30 shares a platform with the Nissan Maxima (Nissan owns Infiniti), and the cars are very similar.  The difference in price is attributed to the name you get, the much better warranty (100,000/10 year engine and drive train, 60,000/6 year bumper to bumper), and the fact that nearly every option is included.  The T model�s difference in performance are to my knowledge not available in a Maxima yet.  

Overall, if you want to get the best value for your money, and are looking for a car with great luxury and ride, for $31000 you can�t go wrong with the Infiniti I30t.
