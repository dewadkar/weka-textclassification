<b>Features</b>

This camera is simple to use, the ease of use is outstanding. You get nothing but good quality here. I have had the chance to use a few digital cameras. I would have to classify this camera as a good overall experience. 

The picture quality is brilliant. Clear high resolution pics. 

What I really liked about this camera is the fact you can place a 3.5 Floppy disk into the camera to place your pictures on. No mumbo jumbo cords or hook ups to view the pictures with your computer. Simply take the 3.5 floppy disk out of the camera and place it into the computer. This makes it rather convenient to carry around just a floppy disk to view the pictures on any computer. 

You can also record short MPEGs with this camera. The battery charger is portable and charges rather quickly. Some features may be a little tricky but if u read the users manual you shouldn't have a problem. The menu system is rather simple, you can sift through your PICS and delete which ever pictures you don't prefer to say on your floppy. 


<b>In Conclusion </b>

Overall I recommend this camera. The camera is very convenient and makes it easy for the user to send pictures in e mails. If your in the market for a nice quality digital came take a look at the Sony MVC - you just might like it. 

The only things I don't recommend about this camera is the bulk and size.  The price of this camera can be thought of as rather high, but you do get a quality convenient camera for your money.
