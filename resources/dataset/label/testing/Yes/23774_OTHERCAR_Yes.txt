            Are you looking for an auto that is dependable, well built, and has a company behind it that treats you as part of an auto family, not just a consumer.....then look no further.  My whole experience with Saturn has been nothing below that statement!

Your experience will start with a visit to the nearest Saturn dealership, where you will be greeted by a knowledgeable and friendly staff and then left to browse the showroom, or lot.  No salesman rushing up with a contract for you to sign!  For me it was like walking into a fresh, clean, and crisp atmosphere, a little strange at first, takes awhile to adjust your consumer lungs!

No automobile is right for every buyer, so first, I will explain who I think is right for a Saturn.  This is a small car, you should fit it, and it should fit you.  That is easy to find out, take one for a test drive.  It is also not a luxury car, look at the window sticker.  Don't want to haggle over price, good, they don't.  Everyone is treated the same at Saturn, from the price to the service.

Our first Saturn was a 1992 SL, the low end model Saturn.  It gave us very good service, until our son bought it, when we upgraded to a 1995 SC2.  It was his first car and is still driving it today.  Our second, a 1994 SL, is now in our daughters hands, and we got a 1997 SC2.  Did I mention our son also has a 1996 SL2.  That should be the best way to express our opinion on this car and company.

In closing, you can also toss your fear of purchasing this auto, because it carries a 30 day, 1500 mile money-back guarantee.  What a test drive offer that is! <br><br>
