            I am a proud owner of a 1999 Chevrolet S-10. Unfortunately, I had to settle for the minimum when making my vehicle purchase, but I am happy so far.

 There are a few problems I have encountered in the 10 months and 22,000 miles I've had my truck; First and foremost, despite an adjustable lumbar support in the driver's seat, I still find my back becomes sore after a couple of hours at the wheel. The cab is also kind of tight; I am only 5'10&quot; tall, but I still find a need for a little bit more leg room than is available. The passenger side isn't much better; Though the passenger seat doesn't contain a lumbar adjustment, it is more comfortable over distances. There is very little room behind the seats for any additions to the sound system, such as an amp or speakers.(I did manage to squeeze in a CD changer, but that's all!) With the only speakers in the dash and doors, all of the sound is in front of you, creating a kind of 'Dead Zone' where the sound is really flat. For the smokers out there, be prepared to purchase a console with an ash tray, because the ash tray is not easily accessible.(The cigarette butts also jump out of the ashtray with even a slight bump!)

 On the positive side, I get great mileage,(22-25 mpg), the 4-cylinder is plenty powerful enough to maneuver into traffic, and it looks great, which means that members of the opposite sex won't be frightened off by some funny-looking piece of junk. To anybody who is looking for a fun, functional pick-up at a good price, the S-10 might be right for you. However, if you have the money to up-grade, at least an extended cab is recommended, mainly for the additional room for carrying kids, groceries, tools, and anything else you don't want to leave outside when you're driving.

 All in all I am pretty satisfied with my investment; Chevy makes a reliable product at an affordable price. I think my next vehicle purchase will be an S_10, just with the addition of an extended cab.Perhaps I'll even stick with maroon...<br><br>
