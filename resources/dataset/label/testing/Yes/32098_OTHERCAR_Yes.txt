            I am a young punk, one of the 20-somethings that older adults merely sneer at because the statistics on our decision making skills yield lower numbers than the IQs of most tree sloths.  However, in the not so distant past I was given the opportunity to ride in, and drive a friend of mine's mother's 300M (yeah, she didn't know that I drove it).  I must say, this is a sweet car.  
Being a car nut, the first thing I did was to immediately bury the gas pedal into the floor until I was rewarded with a very impressive amount of thrust from, yes, a V6.  During this afternoon of automotive abuse, my friend and I put the 300M through its paces on twisty roads, highways, parking lots, and even the woods (don't ask).  What we were rewarded with was a pleasant, if not sporty driving experience in all conditions.  Let's get one thing straight here, this is NOT a BMW, but what it IS an American made luxury automobile that handles with aplomb and rides quite nicely while driving normally. 
And before I forget, I think this car looks freaking cool.  I don't know what it is, but there is something about the styling that howls classy like a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  This is something that my parents and I can agree on, this car has style and trunkloads of it.  Wait, are we talking 300M sized trunkloads?  Because this car has a more than adequate trunk backing up that pretty face.  
The bottom line is that when in the market for a superb luxury automobile, don't sell America short!  The 300M shows that America has still got what it takes to make a sweet ride everyone can enjoy.  Just whatever you do, please don't go over to that origami factory they have going on at Cadillac.  I thought we gave up on making cars out of right angles and boxes years ago.<br><br>
