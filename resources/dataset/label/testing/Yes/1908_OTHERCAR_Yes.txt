            I recently leased a new Nissan Maxima 2000 GLE and to say that I'm pleased with the car is an understatement.   The Maxima is a 'near-luxury' car which continues to take my breath away with each passing day.

The extremely powerful 222 horsepower V6 engine at the heart of this machine provides a perfect blend of sports car and family sedan.  The acceleration that you get out of this car is tremendous (0-60 mph in ~ 6.7 seconds) and it basically leaves the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord in the dust (if I'm not mistaken, they're about a FULL second slower).  By way of comparison, if you enjoyed Marion Jones's decimation of the competition in the 100-meter Olympic final, the Maxima would provide the same thrill and exhilaration, except you'll be running your own race and not living vicariously through that TV set. :) 
**Note: Because the Maxima accelerates so quickly, pulling out from a stationary position requires a gentle touch; in fact, I don't even press the peddle when moving out of a parking space, only when I'm parallel to the road do I begin to accelerate.  

If your spouse is not exactly thrilled with speed, he/she will be impressed with the smooth AND quiet performance.  In fact, because the drive at 90 mph is as smooth as it was at 55 mph, you'll have to keep a close eye on the speedometer.  

Some other notable features in this area I should mention:

1. Smooth Ignition - tired of the wait and crackling noise when starting your engine?  No more with the Maxima, turn the key and the engine is running immediately.
2. Flawless cruise-control - no sudden brakes/acceleration.  Maintains a very even-keeled ride.  

The Interior of the car is well-designed and functional.  The leather seats and wood-paneling in the GLE makes for a luxurious and comfortable interior.  A buddy of mine has a Mercedes Sport Utility (one of the ugliest SUVs around, imho) and after a few rides, I can say with confidence that the comfort-level of the Maxima seats beats the cr*p out of that luxury car.  (Note: Nissan does use 'fake' leather at sections of the seats but it blends in well�)   

I especially like two minor features in the interior:

1. The cup-holder, sandwiched between the gear and the armrest, allows for both standard coke-cans as well as 1-liter bottles by way of a removable tray.  Such a simple but functional detail gets my nod of approval. 
2. Dual-level armrest with Dual level storage - you can adjust the height of your armrest.  The top half of the armrest contains a rather shallow area that's great for items such as gas-receipts, loose change, gas cards etc� the larger bin (like those in most cars) can hold your CDs, Handphone etc� 

Nevertheless, it is still a 'near' luxury car and it most evidently shows by the use of 'cheap-looking' plastics/vinyl on the dash, arm-rest, doors.   However, there a much more positives to focus on such as:

1. The 200-watt Bose seven-speaker system.  If you buy this car, you MUST choose this option. From my limited experience, this is a league above any standard car speaker set.  There is absolutely no distortion when cranked up at high volume or deep bass.  Kudos to Nissan for welding together an interior that can accommodate the Bose.

2. The heavy-set doors which open and close not unlike a high-end luxury car.   The doors take little effort to close and generates the feeling that you're sealing yourself in a sound-proof, airtight cabin.   While not comforting for the claustrophobic, I feel safe whenever I close the door.

As you can tell, I absolutely love this car and recommend to all potential buyers of Accords and Camrys to take a good hard look at the Maxima.  In addition, before buying a car, be sure to check out the discussion groups at www.edmunds.com �.very helpful and knowledgeable individuals populate that message board, not to mention a comprehensive information database about every conceivable car.
