                 Best bang for the buck.  I spent three months comparing sports coupes and found this to be not only one of the best performing, but one of the least expensive.  After everything was said and done, I paid $11,600 for the car.  Compared to the Honda Civic at a base price in the range of $13,000 - $14,000.  I can not express the absolute thrill that it is to drive my ZX2.  You can feel the 130hp, really quickly.  The suspension is firm, but the ride is more fun that way.  The overall visibility is excellent (those who have had Ford Escorts in the past will know what I am talking about). Along those lines, I would also like to say that I can fit in the back seat of the coupe (2 seater) and I am 6'2&quot;.  This is the only coupe I found that I could fit in. 
     I do on the other hand have two problems with the car.  The shifter is a little bit rubbery (the 1st gear synchro doesn't seem to work at as high speeds as I would like) and the engine is a little loud when you want to use all of the horses.  This car is definitely a commuter car, or a cruising car...however listening to the engine for long trips could get rather annoying if you aren't playing loud music (that is if you cruise at 75-85mph like myself.)  
     Overall I would completely recommend this car, I couldn't love it more.  I think it is three times better than all of the Honda Civic's that I tested.  If you are on a budget, but want performance and quality, this is the car for you.  <br><br>
