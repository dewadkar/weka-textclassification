            I decided that I needed something better on gas than my Monte' Carlo, so I started asking around about the different cars that I would see.

I'm sure I drove everyone at my office crazy asking them what type of car they drove and what they liked or disliked about their cars.

One day as I was driving the near twenty miles from work I spotted a small used car lot that I'd never noticed before and sitting in front was this white Pontiac Sunbird Convertible with a spoiler on the back and factory wheels.  

I'd known other people that had owned other small Pontiac models but never anyone that had owned a Sunbird so I started checking around.

I checked with different mechanics and part stores for what information they might have on these little cars and EVERYONE said they were pretty good cars.  One mechanic however added that I should make sure it had the 2.0 liter engine that the other sizes seemed to have more problems.

I bought my 1990 Pontiac with 98,000 miles on it three years ago.  It now has over 127,000 miles on it and has never let me down.

I have had to change the rear wheel bearings but other than that it's been pretty much standard maintenance (oil, filter, spark plugs).  My car looks exactly like the one pictured above except I do have a spoiler on the back. 

The little car holds the road remarkably well even at speeds in excess of 100 mph.  (When I try out a car, I try out a car!)  

Another plus for this little car is the ease in which you can do things like change the spark plugs (they are easy to reach, no struggling to get that last plug in as I've had to do on other models) and the wheel bearings took about a half hour to change.  So all in all it's not only built to be long lasting but easy to work on as well.

This is a great little car, so if you're looking for something nice and find one, it's worth the money.<br><br>
