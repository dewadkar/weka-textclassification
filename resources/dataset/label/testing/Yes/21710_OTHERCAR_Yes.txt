            I've already got an opinion about my 1998 Chevy Cavalier on Epinions, but somehow, the category year got changed to 1987!  Anyway, I needed to change a few things anyway, so here it is again, with a few minor revisions!

For anyone who has heard people say not to buy a Chevy Cavalier because it's cheap and undependable, I just have to say &quot;THIS IS HOGWASH!&quot;

I'm in my 40's now, and I've had quite a few cars in my lifetime, new
and used. For most of my younger years, I drove various British
Leyland products, mostly MG after MG. I've always liked the smaller
cars, and the last one of these I had was a Triumph Spitfire. Again,
this was a car that everybody shuddered at, and was one of my best
experiences!

But that was in the younger, more energetic days. More than 10
years ago, I got lazy and started driving an automatic.

Last September, I decided to get a year old, 1998, BRIGHT aqua,
Chevy Cavalier. I didn't really want the four door model, and still
wouldn't particularly recommend that to anyone, but the car itself has
been an excellent buy.

The Cavalier has a very sturdy, heavy feel to it, after driving very
small cars, and I was very surprised at the smoothness of the ride.
Indeed, compact cars have come a long way since the 80's. The
motor purrs like a kitten...so quiet that you actually have to listen to
see if it is running! Although I'm not race car driver, it handles very
well, taking curves and sudden turns as well as any of my sports cars
ever did. It has a beautiful paint job on it, seeming to accept the
intense sun and salt from the ocean without a problem. The air
conditioner is GRAND! (This of course is coming from an old
convertible driver..) The stereo, which is the bare standard model,
with a cassette player, seems to have the bass and tone of the very
expensive new car stereo set ups. I work where they sell car stereo,
amps and such, and have felt no need to upgrade.

To wrap up, I've now had my Cavalier for about 10 months. It is now
a full 2 years old, has 31,000 miles on it, and still purrs along. I've not had to take it anywhere for service, aside from oil changes and tire
stuff. Everything on the car is in as tip-top shape as when I bought it.
I fully recommend this car to anyone who wants a dependable, reliable, inexpensive, and CUTE car to drive!  It also gets excellent gas mileage, possibly over 35mpg.  I'm not sure, but I've noticed no increase in gas from my last old Pontiac Fiero, and it got at least that.  Surprisingly, the air conditioner doesn't seem to make much difference here, either!

As an aside, this is why I don't like a four door. I'm not sure they are
all this way, but mine has no outside door locks on the back doors. This
sort of depletes the entire reason for having back doors in my opinion!

You have to open the front doors and reach in and around to open the back ones....and I do hate that! Because of this, it is much more convenient to put anything you are carrying in the trunk...which, by the way, is HUGE... and comes with a back seat that folds down to make it even bigger!

This one thing is the only complaint I have with the car, and it's a very minor one, considering!<br><br>
