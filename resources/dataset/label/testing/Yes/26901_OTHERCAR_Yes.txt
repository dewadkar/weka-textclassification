            I'm gonna drive it until the wheels fall slam off of it.  And at the rate we're going, that's never going to happen!

I got this car when I turned 21.  Actually, it wasn't a birthday gift, it just so happened that I go it on that day.  My dad is a car salesman and he was on the lookout for a car for me since my mom totaled my other one.

I really do love this car.  I've never had a problem with it as far as the mechanics of it go.  I have had two different occasions when someone did a hit and run number on it - once when I was visiting Virginia Tech and the other time when a fireman who lived downstairs from me slammed into it on the way to a fire.

I've had the car for 6 years and no mechanical problems.  You can't beat that.  It's got over 120,000 miles on it and still purrs like a kitten.  The old girl is getting up in the years though.  I've had a few little things to happen lately, like my gas gauge finally gave out, but that's fixable and understandable after 10 years of running.  Another thing that embarrassed the hell out me a few weeks ago was that my horn got stuck while I was driving home from work.  I honked all the way home with people staring at me and flipping me the bird.  But it was fixable too.  No biggie.

It's a nice little family car, or it's perfect for a young person who's on the go.  I like that it has four doors, automatic seat belts, automatic windows and automatic locks.  Mine has cruise control, which I adore.  I dig the rear defrost too.  

It handles well, and I feel safe in it.  It's a smooth ride all the way.

I am not a car junkie.  I think it's pretty stupid to spend a sh*tload of money on a car for the way it looks.  You need to be safe in your car, not look good.  I mean, that's just my opinion.  As long as it has air conditioning and a radio, who cares?  It's a <i>car</i>.

I think everyone should give a Camry a chance.  It's one of the best cars out there.  I know that there are new models out there, and I'm not saying you should go out looking for a 1991 Toyota Camry.  But, if you have a teenager who is in need of an automobile and you want to spend as little money as possible on the best car available, you should definitely look into this car.  I happen to think that the more miles you put on it, the better ride you get.<br><br>
