            First, I didn't buy this vehicle -- I rented it.  If you ask me, anyone who's serious about buying a vehicle should rent it first.  You get to drive it for a couple of days without some obnoxious salesperson hanging on your shoulder, and you also get to see what kind of shape the vehicle will be in after a few thousand miles of road use.  Most renters treat the vehicles pretty shabbily, but the rental companies actually take pretty good care of them -- very regular maintenance, cleanup after every use, and the like.  So, here's my take on the '99 Windstar after three days and 360 miles of driving.

I'm not a fan of Detroit iron -- the three vehicles at my house are all Japanese/American.  So I always compare quality, ride, and the like to my Honda and my two Toyota pickups.  Here's the lowdown on the Windstar:

Quality:  the vehicle I drove had 16K miles on it, but seemed to be in pretty good shape.  There were some squeaks and rattles coming from that left-hand sliding door, and an annoying whistle from somewhere in the right front at highway speeds.  I never did figure where that came from.  Unlike my three at home, a lot of the interior plastic parts seemed to be pretty cheesy.  One of the cute little ceiling compartments (a very nice idea, by the way) had been stripped of its innards.  There was a piece broken out of the dashboard cup holders, and the interior door-handle mounts rocked in their mounts.  Overall, the quality seemed to be slightly above the Detroit cars I've been driving, but not up to the standards of the Japanese imports.  There was a little more road noise than I expected, but it was a pretty quiet ride.

Handling:  Personally, I think Detroit's emphasis on a smooth ride leads to vehicles that wallow on the road like pigs in a mudhole.  This one was no better than average (nowhere near as bad as a Jeep Cherokee, though).  I drove it for 60 miles in a very heavy rainstorm, and it held the road very well, but on dry pavement it had a tendency to drift in the ruts. 

Comfort:  Well, that's what Detroit's always aiming for; QE2-level comfort.  I didn't have any rear-end fatigue after a three-hour drive, so I guess they succeeded.  I had a little trouble adjusting the steering wheel to a suitable angle, though, and I'm of very average size.

Design features:  I liked the two-sided sliding doors -- I just hope the frame's stiffened enough to stand up to a rough ride.  They had cute little motor-driven tiltouts on the rear, also nice -- no exterior ventilation in the center at all, though.  I found the location of the parking brake annoying -- I haven't seen a floor-mounted brake between the seats in a very long time.  They've put together a few other interesting features -- one of them is the chime that rings after a turn signal has been on for over a preset time (a minute, I'd guess).  That's nice, but where I live (Austin, TX) you're very likely to sit for twice that long at a stop light waiting to turn, so that darned chime would go off pretty frequently.  

Miscellany:  I had a flat (not the van's fault) and had to put on one of those truly idiotic compact spares.  It's mounted under the frame, so (since it was raining) was very wet and dirty.  Them's the breaks, though.  Besides not having a real tire, though, the worst thing was the lousy scissors jack.  Actually, it was the integrated jack-handle and lug wrench.  The jack handle kept slipping off the driver nut on the jack, enough that I was cursing the memory of Henry by the time I finished changing the flat.  That needs some attention, especially on a $26000 minivan.  Oh and one last point -- why is there no key lock on the passenger side?  This vehicle didn't have a keyless remote, so whenever I wanted to get in the curbside door, I had to walk around to the driver's side to unlock things first.  That's a dangerous, and therefore stupid, design.

So, if you're dead set on buying American (not always *my* first choice) this one looks like a good candidate.  My sister's family had a Ford Aerostar for years, and they got good value from it.  My experience with Chrysler minis has been a lot less positive, so I'd pass on those guys if I were you.
