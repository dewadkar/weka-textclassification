            I owned a 1994 Grand Prix that I purchased new in Fall 1993.  When my son turned 16 and needed a car to get to school, work and sports.  It made more sense to buy me a new car and pass my 94 Grand Prix to him then to purchase a used car for him that we had no idea of the history.  I started out looking a Subarus and I was looking for a 1999, since it was still 1999.  The salesperson was a jerk!!!  I decided to look at a Mitubishi - just because I had heard the 1999 models were all wheel drive and I thought they were cute.  We stopped at a Pontiac dealer.  I looked at the few 1999 models they have left.  I saw a beautiful car - only to find that it was a 2000 model.  This is the same thing that happened to me in 1993.  The color - Bronzemist - was glorious, even dirty.  Once I drove the car I was hooked.  Even though the sunroof removed the overhead console that I liked, I still could not find another car on the lot that I liked better.  I drove a Grand Am and a Bonneville, but still liked the handling and gadgetry of the Grand Prix.  I am not big on sound systems, so the system that came with the car was more than I needed, but I have found that I like it since (and my son is very jealous). 
The car is not all wheel drive but has a Trac system, which I have no idea what that is for as it has never been evoked.  The environment system takes a lot of getting used to.  I have found that it will start cooling or heating when I still want the opposite because it thinks the inside temperature is too high or too low.  It is very hard to adjust it to do what you want.
I am very pleased, was happy with the dealership - which I have never been back to as the car has needed no maintenance.  I think the car is perfect for almost anyone who wants a sports sedan.  <br><br>
