            We bought the Dodge Ram Quad Cab  in 1998.  I was nervous at first but we needed a larger vehicle with  three growing boys.  We had a Stratus but the back was getting tight for  the kids.  We test drove the Dodge Ram and I was amazed I could drive it. There is a lot more room in the back for the kids and with the bed ,everything  goes in there and not on everyone's lap.
 It was very surprising how much more you could actually see when you are driving.  I would always get nervous turning onto street because I could never see if anything was coming. Now I can see down the road and have no worries.  
       When winter hit I hung up my keys when we had the car. Where we live it is all hills and I just did not have the nerve to drive.  I trust the Dodge Ram , especially with four wheel drive.  I now take my kids to school  snow or not.  I have a lot more confidence behind the wheel. <br><br>
