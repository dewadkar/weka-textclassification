            I just bought a 1997 Green Sahara for my wife. 
We bought one with 70k miles on it and I have to say it seems brand new.  I paid 11,500 for it, so I don't have any buyer's remorse.  

This is a 3rd car for us, so it is our toy although my wife likes her gift so much that I wonder if her accord will be driven much going forward.  She has a 4 mile commute to the elementary school where she teaches so the Jeep is great for her needs.  I bought it from a man who was commuting to work and I just don't think that would work for many people.  It will get you around just fine, but it is not very smooth ride.

HOWEVER, it is not as bad as many people would describe.  It wasn't nearly as loud as I have read.  Actually, we were driving down the highway last night doing 55 and we laughed at how relatively quiet it was.  After reading some epinions about how you can barely hear yourself think, I was pleasantly surprised to find that we could carry on a conversation just fine. Sure, we had some road and wind noise, but it wasn't so extreme.  

Here's my take on the 4 vs 6 cyl.:  
For most people, the 4 cyl. is just fine.  If you are not going to pull a boat or off road much, then the 6 cyl. may be a waste.  I enjoy the added power on acceleration, but the reason I chose it was because I will be pulling a ski boat and need the power.  Otherwise, I would have saved a few bucks.  That brings me to a tip: shop around and you can find a deal like I did.  Autotrader.com has quite a few being offered. We considered buying a 4 cyl for 12.5k and wound up finding a 6 cyl for 1k less.  It amazed me at how many dealerships were offering the 97 sahara for 15-18k- no thanks, I'll keep the extra 3-5k in my pocket.  Take your time, you'll find a good deal.

All around, this will be great when it warms up, but its a fun vehicle even on a rainy 36 degree day in Dallas.
