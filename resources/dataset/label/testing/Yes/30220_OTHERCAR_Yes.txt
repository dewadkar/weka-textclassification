            I love my Odyssey!  This minivan is head and shoulders above all other minivans.  It is safer, cooler, taller on the inside, and the power doors are awesome when you have a squirming baby in your arms.

The interior height of the EX model (4 inches taller on the inside than the LX) comes in very handy. On a recent road trip, I was able to walk to the back and attend to my baby while my husband was driving down the highway and I'm not a small woman.

The mileage is good for a large vehicle.  I think they advertise about 23 to 24 miles to the gallon, which I find to be accurate.  It comes with the following standard equipment:  AC, CD player, radio, front and side airbags in the front, captain's chairs for the first two rows, mesh bag in the trunk (very handy to keep groceries from going all over the roomy trunk), cruise control, and power doors.  There are also nifty buttons on the steering wheel to change radio stations and adjust the volume.

The handling and instrument panel are so good it's a bit scary.  Since my hubby drives a Honda Accord, I was used to the Honda dashboard and sometimes I have to remind myself to be careful and remember I'm driving a minivan.

The turning radius is great.  Like most vans, it has practically no "nose," so you can get out of tight spots in front.  As for backing, you gotta be careful because vans have a notoriously big blind spot.  (There is an optional backing sensor and beeper which we did not get.)

I never thought I'd even want a minivan but this is my dream car.  The only thing I miss from my old car is the temp gauge and compass that I had on my rear view mirror.
