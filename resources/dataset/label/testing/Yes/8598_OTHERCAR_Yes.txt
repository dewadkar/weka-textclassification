            Why did i buy this vehicle?

I was talking to my dawg Mannie, when he was like you gotta buy this new bentley!  So I went out and bought.  I put some new chrome dubs on it, and some loud pipes, and then I was bling blingin.  This car is fast, and handles well.  

What I love and hate about this vehicle?

What I love about my new ride is that when i come through town everyone knows its me cause of my loud pipes!  This car handles well, and drives real fast.  Also, I like to keep my price tag on my bentley just to let everyone know who I am and how much money I make jsut from keepin it real and rappin.  What I hate about this vehicle is that I can't put no hydrolics in it cause it will mess up the wheel alignment.

What is it like to drive this wehicle?

This vehicle is one of the nicest rides I own.  Its fast, quick, responsive, and handles well.  If you don't mind spending the extra couple thousands, then you should put some chrome dubs on it, tinted windows, and loud pipes and then you would be bling blingin!  

Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't?

Everyone from the dirty south thats livin large should get one of these jonts.  If you some fake baller blocka, then you shouldn't buy this car.

I recommend this car for all my dirty south ballers who are keepin it real!<br><br>
