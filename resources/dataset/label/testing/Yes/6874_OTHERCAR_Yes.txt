            I recently purchased a new 1999 Hyundai Elantra.  It was one of the wisest decisions I've made in a while.  The Elantra is a very comfortable car.  There is plenty of room for its size.  I get great gas mileage.  I would estimate about 29 mpg on the highway and close to 25 mpg in the city.  The Elantra is equiped with bracket pinion steering.  With the car in park, I can turn the wheel both ways with one finger.  The engine is a 4 cyl 2.0 liter, but for its size it has plenty of get-up-and-go.  There is not a lot of wind noise, and the factory speakers are top of the line.  I definitely recommend the Hyundai Elantra to anybody whose interested.<br><br>
