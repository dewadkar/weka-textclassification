            UPDATE2: My lease is due next month and I will not be looking at another Volvo. In Nov, I had to get a new battery and tires for a car that wasn't 3 years old.  My front brakes are 1/2 worn again!  Luckily, I got some $ back from Volvo for the battery due to the age of the vehicle and mileage.
UPDATE1: My lease will  be up in April '03.  I'm debating if I should look at the S60 and the new xc90 (Volvo) b/c of the recent problems I've encountered.  I had to change my rear brakes 2 x's in 1 year and did the front ones for the first time too.  This shouldn't happen w/ a car having 36,000 miles.  I need new tires too.  Now once again I've had to change the headlight.  I also had to change the brake light too.  These lights were designed to be changed by someone w/ really small hands.  I'm a petite person and could barely change the headlight.  The space is minimal.  I had to change the passenger side light which is located in front of where the windshield washer fluid goes. You have to pull this rubber protective thing off in order to get to the light.  Then you have to disconnect the light.  YOu have no space to pull.  Then try getting the plastic protective thing back on in this space of maybe 2 inches. I'm not sure what you'd do on the other side b/c it is located in front of the battery.  Now on to the brake light - you can't remove the bulbs -  3 connected to this hard rubber piece.  More likely than not on bulb will fall off into the cramped space or will fall into the open space.  Since the space to take out the 3 bulbs is smaller than opening it is a really pain.  The plastic in the opening is to sharp my arm got all scratched.  once you get the bulb in - try putting this stupid 3 bulbs back in place.  You have to get the big thing into the small space now and course the bulbs fall off once again.  Big headache.  Now on to the brakes - I don't do a lot of stop and go traffic but the brakes warped w/in a year of being replaced.  The light didn't go on - I wouldn't have known about the brakes if I didn't get an inspection of car done while changing oil.  The company changing oil looked for recall b/c this shouldn't happen but couldn't find any.  I'm disappointed about the junky tires too.  I'm going to have to get them before the lease is up so at least I can enjoy them for a few months.   
I got my Volvo S40 b/c it you got a lot for your $.  Better than the Audi.  I really enjoy my Volvo S40. It is the 2nd Volvo in my family.  They are reliable cars.  The other was a 89 740 Gle which my sister drove and got rid of 11 years later w/ 200,000  miles.  Now onto the S40.  I leased it Jan 2000 - pretty much when it first came out. 
Don't get the 1st Service done at the dealer - you'll eat your hat how expensive it is - $200  take it to your local STS, Midas - you get the point.  YOu are only changing the oil, rotating the tires etc etc.  It's the labor that kills you.
I too had to replace the the bulbs twice.  The 2nd time I brought the car to the dealer they replaced both bulbs b/c they were having a lot of problems w/ them.  They had gotten a new type.  I haven't had a problem since then.  I have seen others that had one light out too so I new I wasn't the only one. It was covered under warranty.
Today at 18600 miles, I brought my car in for service b/c the check engine light came on several times - 2 times after refueling and 2 or 3 times after just starting it.  The 1st time it happened was after getting gas - thought the guy didn't put the lid back on tightly enough.  So I tightened it b/c that's what the manual said.  Then it happened some other times - thought maybe it was the gas I was using.  The DSA light came on twice too.  They replaced the software - so far they hasn't come on yet. It is funny b/c I had a loaner today - 2001 s40 - the check engine light was on at only 10090 miles.  (it drives nicely and has a better sound system.)
I also have replaced those stupid volvo emblems that have come off so many times I want them to glue it in.  the first time it happened the guy wanted to charge me $35/emblem which wasn't in stock.  that same day I spoke to my sales person -  he got me the 2 that i needed @ no charge.  today they replaced the one i needed at no charge! beware - not to get charged.
Does anyone have a problem w/ the driver's window not being aligned? it only seems to happen when i have left the window open for about 10 minutes or more.
I had to change the brake pads which I was surprised that i had to do - i have a 98 grand cherokee w/ 36000 miles  which i have never had to do. my husband who is a mechanic said that it is common for front wheel drive cars so early.  luckily he changed it b/c it only cost $49 plus an 1 1/2 of his time.  the dealer would have charged close to $200.
Since this is the 1st year, there are always quarks that need to get straightened out.  It is been a great car. I love it and can't complain.  I would buy another Volvo but would probably get the S60 t5 b/c it is faster and have many competitors in the family that like to race!
hope this was helpful -
