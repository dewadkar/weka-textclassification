            Just last week my family and I were able to experience the most luxurious driving machine available in its class.  I haven't experienced any of the other models, but after driving the LS 400 I can come to the conclusion that Lexus makes great cars.  The handling was top of the line.  Every turn felt as if the steering wheel was on air.  For such a large car it was as powerful as anything and could take even the sharpest turns without any sort of problem.  The back seats in the car are large enough to fit as much as three to four people with ease.  I know that I am supposed to jot down a reason for not buying this vehicle, but in the time period I used the car I was unable to acknowledge any errors.  So what I have to say to you is... if you wish to spend the money, here is the car!   <br><br>
