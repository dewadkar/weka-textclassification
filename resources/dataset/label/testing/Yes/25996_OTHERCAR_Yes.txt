               I for one cannot stand cheap salesmen.  For this reason, I found the Chevy dealership that I bought my Cavalier from to be extremely helpful.  I had a somewhat unique purchase.  I bought the Cavalier from an Indiana dealership, but through a Florida dealership.  Both were very helpful in making the purchase easy.  I have absolutely no complaints about customer servicing.  Chevrolet handles that with excellence.  
   And now the about the car.  I purchased a 150 hp, four door, 2000 Cavalier.  It has been absolutely perfect, and I mean not a single complaint about it.  I took it back to the dealership for an oil change at 3,000 miles and I left in the car almost fifteen minutes later.  The car is sporty and fun to drive.  It is extremely economical, yet it does not look like a some sort of peanut shaped enclosure that would fold up in a second in an accident.  The Cavalier is a very good car, simply put.  I also have the satisfaction of knowing that if anything does go wrong with the car, I can take it to a Chevy dealer and they will take care of it promptly.
