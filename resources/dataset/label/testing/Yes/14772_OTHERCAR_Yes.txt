            You don't think of those words when you normally think of SUV...but the Mountaineer is made to change that.  This is the most comfortable, luxurious, powerful, easy to drive, impressive, make a statement on the mind and keep it there SUV I have ever owned.  

I have never bought an American vehicle.  I normally buy foreign when it comes to cars.  But, I've always said that if I buy a SUV, then it will be American.  I started out by looking for a Durango, but then as I was looking around, I saw this SUV sitting there sparkling in the sun.  It drew me.  I got the salesman to open her up, and I fell in love...

It handles like a car, is functional like a truck but a whole lot more, it's not noisy, the sound system is incredible, and the seats fold down so easily!  If anyone out there thinking about this vehicle has dogs that you like taking with you, then this is the SUV for you.  There is no pulling the bottom bench forward...then removing the headrests...then folding down the top...then storing the headrests.  NO WAY!  All you gotta do is pull a lever, push the top seat over... the bottom slides forward into position on its own and the headrests are on some sort of swivel that rests easily against the back of the front seats.  WHAM BAM!  You're done.  

This is the mother of SUVs...(I'm actually surprised it came from Mercury.  But my hat's off to them.  They did a great job with the Mountaineer.)<br><br>
