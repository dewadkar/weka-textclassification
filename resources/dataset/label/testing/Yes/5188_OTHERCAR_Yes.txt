                 &quot;That is one tough looking Accord&quot; said one onlooker at the Dairy Queen parking lot.  This was many of several compliments I received on my then new 1998 Honda Accord EX V6 2 door coupe.  This car will attract attention, and with good reason.  
   
     Probably the single coolest thing about this 2 door hot-rod is that it looks almost nothing like the 4 door version.  Many of the styling ques have come from the sportier Prelude.  This can especially be noted by slab- sided door panels with there smooth line just below the window.  The taillights also resemble the Prelude's.  

     I opted for black current pearl (purple) paint, as well as fog lights, a decklid spoiler, and stainless steel exhaust tips.  I felt this would give my car an &quot;identity&quot;.
  
     Comfort is adequate, to say the least.  After sitting in the car for more that about 2 hours, my back starts to show a little fatigue.  I appreciate the looks of the grey leather interior, I just feel the comfort of actually sitting on it to be so-so.  The sound system is at best average, thank god for aftermarket speakers.  
     
     Despite other's negative remarks' concerning the tires, I believe the Michelin Energy MXV4-Plus to be one of the best tires on the market and to be a perfect match to the Accord.  They give excellent steering response and provide excellent wet grip.  The only other tires that I would put on it are the Perelli P-Zero or the Michelin Pilot HX MXM, but I don't believe either tire is available in 205/60R16 yet. 
     
     Since there are so many wonderful aspects of the Accord coupe, I would recommend this car to just about anybody.  I would especially recommend this to someone who owns a Ford Probe or Pontiac Grand Am who is looking to go for a little more class.  I personally came off of a Chevy Beretta and was nervous about the performance capabilities of the Honda.  Believe me, this car delivers.  There are only 2 reasons NOT to buy this car: 1.  If you cannot stand the fact of buying a car from a Japanese Manufacturer (although the Accord is assembled in the U.S.) OR 2. You can afford to buy a Lexus GS 400.<br><br>
