            My husband and I were in the market to purchase or lease a new vehicle.  We have always been loyal to Ford, but couldn't quite figure out, which vehicle would be best for our family of four. 

 There are a lot of options out there...SUV's, family cars, and pickup trucks.  The top priority for us was to have something safe.  The next issue was price.  We weren't about to sacrifice safety, so we talked to our dealer.  Our first choice was the Expedition, we really liked the size, comfort and safety of this vehicle.  But unfortunately, the price was a bit high for us to lease or purchase, so that was out of the picture.  Our dealer suggested an Explorer, but I found that too was pricey, and a little small for what we liked.  He then suggested the F-150 Supercrew.  

As soon as we saw it, we wanted it.  It was everything we were looking for.  Not only was it a good looking truck, it also had the size, the room, and comfort we were looking for.  My nearly 6 foot tall son, fit comfortable in the back.  The four fullsize doors made getting in and out easy.  We are always hauling something around, so the pickup bed was an added pleasure. But the real pleasure was when we drove it up the highway...the ride is smooth and quiet, the seats are very comfortable, and the 5.4 liter engine, has no problem getting up steep grades, or pulling out onto the highway and getting up to speed.  The gas mileage is bearable, at upwards of 22 mpg on the highway.  The next thing to consider was the price.  We were amazed that the sticker was nearly 10,000 dollars less than the Expedition.  Although the Expedition had four wheel drive, we really didn't need that option.  So we leased our Supercrew, and have been happy with it ever since.  It turns a lot of heads, many people are surprised to see the four full doors, and how much room we have inside.  We got everything we wanted, and more...safety, comfort, size, towing capabilities, and a goodlooking truck...I love my F-150 Supercrew!!!<br><br>
