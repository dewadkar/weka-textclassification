            Have 2 Jeep Grand Cherokees.

#1  1999 Laredo, 4.0L I-6, Selec-Trac. Everglade Green Pearl/Agate cloth. Has 6700 miles on it. Given me zero problems. Runs great! Going to be set-up for trail use.

#2  2000 Laredo, 4.7L V8, Quadra-Trac II. Silverstone Metallic/Taupe leather. Has 8700 miles on it. No problems! Mostly the highway vehicle. 

Very quiet. Performance is more than adequate even with the 6 cylinder. The V8 gives it more acceleration than a lot of cars! The ultimate offroad. One of the few SUV's to have a full-time 4WD system that can be used onroad. Performance offroad is better than anything short of a Wrangler, Hummer, Defender 90 or Mercedes G-Wagon. (the latter 3 costing a lot more) Personally I think it's the best value for the money. Highly recommend anyone shopping for an SUV check it out!!<br><br>
