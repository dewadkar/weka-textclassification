            I got this camera over 6 months ago, and I am still amazed at the quality and ease of use!  This was my second digital camera (I had an old dinosaur from when digital cameras first came out!).  Right out of the box, I was able to easily figure out most of the function buttons on the camera, and could navigate through the different areas with ease.

The camera uses 2 AA batteries. The kit I purchased came with 2 AA Lithium batteries. I am a "tinkerer" when it comes to electronics. I'm always pushing buttons and basically wearing out my batteries. I recommend getting rechargeable batteries. As long as I don't tinker too much or overuse the flash, I can get a 168 MB card full of pics before I have to change batteries (about 45 pics). I still use the lithiums, but will be getting rechargeables soon! 
It comes with an auto-everything feature so it's just like a regular point-and-shoot, but you can also control when the flash is used. It also has "red-eye" flash mode that removes the red-eye look when taking portraits. 

You have to get used to a little 1 second delay from when you push the shutter release until a picture is taken, but they have even given it a "shutter release sound" so there is no question when the photo was captured. A small high definition screen on the back of the camera will display for a few seconds the picture you just shot.  If you like it, great!  If not, deleting is a breeze.  You can even pre-designate what to do with the pics after you get home.  The 812 has an "Instant Share" feature that allows you to have the pictures ready for email or printing after you get home.

The only troubling photos were ones I took in low light.  However, I was able to get a great picture of my Christmas tree with no other lights on in the room except for the tree itself.  The camera warned me that it could not focus, so I put it on a pocket tripod I had.  It took a little trial and error, but it was so easy to delete the bad ones that it was a snap!

I'm the type of person who, knowing I can delete any image before I commit to printing it, takes advantage of the Secure Digital memory cards!  I have 1 256mb card, 1 128mb card, and the 16 mb card that came with it.  During a week-long vacation I was able to snap away without a care and review my selections before deciding which to keep.  By the way, I use the "4 star" high quality settings for everything.  That way if I luck out and get a really great shot I can crop or enlarge with ease.  If you have a laptop, you can use the additional cable that comes with the camera to download pictures on the road!

The zoom feature takes a little practice, but after two or three uses it is almost second nature.  I recommend using a tripod any time you use the zoom.
