              I inherited this car from my mom when somebody totaled my beetle.  I had the 1993 Wolfsburg edition Cabriolet until 2000, when I traded it in for a Toyota truck.  The cabriolet was white on white, and I must say it was a cute little car.  The Wolfsburg edition had white vinyl interior, which looks a billion times better than the cloth upholstery these days.  It also had fancy wheels, rims, steering wheel, radio, and a few other luxuries.  

  All in all it was a good car, but I lost faith in it during the 6th year.  Up until then, the car had never given us any trouble.  One time in a huge flood we went through a giant puddle which stalled the engine.  I drove it up a hill a few minutes later when it started again to drain the fluid.  Other than that, I had no problems.

  In the sixth year, in one week, it seemed to fall apart on me.  One day the battery died so completely it wasn't even funny.  It didn't fade away and then die--it just died.  No big deal, except it stranded me and took up half my day getting it fixed.  The next day, at a red light, the car started to chug and then steam came out from under the hood.  Luckily I was right by a gas station so I pulled in and then the car died for good.  One of the hoses had burst, so the engine wasn't getting any pressure. It only cost about $60 to fix it, but again it took my whole day away.  Three days after that two timing belts snapped--two!  Same story there.  Cheap to fix but time consuming.  

  After that I just didn't feel safe in the car.  I was driving back and forth to college along highway 5 in California, which is the most desolate highway in the state.  I did not want to break down in the middle of nowhere on my 350 mile one-way trip for even the smallest of things.  I bought myself a Toyota Tacoma, brand new, and traded the car in.  That little car held its value very well over the years.  I think it was still worth 1/3 its original value 7 years later.  That's pretty good considering it wasn't that expensive to begin with.  

    The stereo is pretty nice but it didn't have a CD player.  The car was crafted very skillfully, I think.  The car felt very sturdy inside and out, like you'd be fine in an accident.  It has a nice sturdy roll bar under the convertible top in case you roll (god forbid).  If you pound on the door you can feel how solid it is.  

  I also really liked the way it handled.  You had to push a little harder on the gas and brakes than a brand new car, but I liked that better because it felt more in control.  I hate when I tap the breaks in my car now and I skid to a stop.  If I want to skid to a stop, I'll stomp on the breaks anyway.  It's not like anyway just taps on their brakes in an emergency, so that is a useless function.  

  The turning radius is incredible on this car.  It pretty much rotates on an axis. You can maneuver your way around and through anything.  It is compact so you can fit in the smallest of parking spaces.
  
  The convertible top is pretty easy to put up and down, but it's not a push button or anything.  It gets obnoxious snapping the cover over the folded top and then putting it back in the trunk when the top is on.  Also, one thing I hate about the convertible is it's gigantic wind resistance.  When you drive on the freeway, you can hardly carry on a conversation because the wind blows so loudly across the top of the car--and that's even when there is no wind outside.  

  The seats are very comfortable in the front and back, but since there are only two doors, getting in and out is a real pain.  Tall men don't have a problem in the front seat, but they can't have enough leg room in the back.  The back is appropriate for anyone under 5'7" tall.  

  The cabriolet also gets really good gas mileage.  It hold 12 gallons and gets about 24 mpg on the streets and 30 on the highway.  

  Overall it was a great little car to own and I'm glad I did.  Now I'm a big pickup gal, so I wouldn't want to own this car again.
