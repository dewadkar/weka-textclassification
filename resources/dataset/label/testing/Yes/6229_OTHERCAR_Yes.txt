            I baught a 1995 se-v6.  It had 42,000 miles on it and i love it . It has 4 weel drive and an extende cab.  The only thing i dont like about it is the fact that since it is a v-6, it should have a lot more power then it has. My friend baught a 2000 truck and said there is a lot more power and there is a lot more room ! The truck has an amazing amount of power on the get go even with a large tow. The price weas afordable!!! The room in the back has gotten better sicne the one that i baught.  The thing i dont like about it is the bed has gotten smaller. I like a big bed to put -things in ..... i think the models that are comming out now with the smaller bed are ugly.
