            I recently purchased a 2000 Subaru Outback Wagon and am very happy with the product. It has been changed up a little for 2000. It is an excellent car for myself because I have a family. I think this is the car buyer that Subaru targets more with these cars than offroad drivers bacause the car is perfect for families. I would also expect that anyone driving in offroad situations woud not be caught dead in this car.


The car does have a little more offrad capabilities than the average family wagon, but I still not push mine too far. It can be comforting when the roads aren't so goo though, because you don't have to worry about the car busting. 


The Subaru's engine was beefed up a little bit for 2000. The Outback has a 2.5 liter, 16-valve engine, and 165 horsepower. The torque is 166 pounds at 4000 rpm. The Outback has a fueltank of 16.9 gallons. It gets 23 mpg for city driving and 29 mpg highway. This is my biggest problem with the Outback. With gas prices as they are it can end up costing you a lot of money to drive the outback. 

All-in-all I am happy with my outback and would recommend it to others.<br><br>
