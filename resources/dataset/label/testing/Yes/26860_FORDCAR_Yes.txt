            We own a 1999 Expedition XLT with the Triton V8 engine and almost every available option.  It is passionately known by our friends as &quot;the Mother Ship&quot; of all trucks/SUVs.  

We bought the truck primarily for size and functionality.  We have two kids and two dogs.  We are a very active family and needed the space to bring everyone along!  Our truck has very comfortable seating for 8 (plenty of legroom even in the second row of seats).  We spent the extra money and got the leather captains chairs too -- wow, what comfort!!  It rides as smooth as could be too - not the usual rough and tumble of sport utilities.

I have had many people in parking lots stop me and ask what I think of our truck.  My common response has come to be, &quot;I love it!  It's worth every single penny I spent on it!&quot;

Not only is it an attractive truck, it is really functional.  Cup holders are everywhere including the nice fold down part of the second row of seats.  This is very handy with kids in the truck.  No more holding pop between their knees.  

Get all the extras you can with this truck.  Folding mirrors (nice when pulling into more narrow spaces), movable pedals, hidden CD player with stereo controls in the second row of seats, towing package, luggage rack, get it all.  This really is the Cadillac of sport utilities!

The only downfall of this truck is that it doesn't get the 30+ mpg like our car does.  Oh well -- it's still worth it!
