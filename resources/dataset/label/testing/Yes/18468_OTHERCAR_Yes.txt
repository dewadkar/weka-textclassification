What happens when an excellent luxury auto maker goes �slumming� in the  sub $30,000 segment of today�s ultra competitive new car market?  Surprisingly  a very competent sport sedan that will appeal to young and old alike.

Lexus make great cars, there is no question about that, but many a raised eyebrow was the result of Lexus� foray into the �entry luxury� car market. The result of this venture was the very popular the Lexus IS300. A rear-wheel drive sport sedan that is changing the way many view Lexus. The formula is simple; small car, big engine, wide wheels and tires, razor sharp handling and suspension, reasonable price. But can a company know primarily for reliable luxury cars pull it off? In short the answer is yes. 

The Lexus IS300 has a starting price of just over $28,000. Not a bad price considering you�ll get a 215 hp I6, 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, power features galore, heated outside mirrors, and an 8 speaker, 6-CD audio system. The problem with Lexus (as well as other luxury car makers) is that, while the standard equipment list is lengthy, ordered with the usual options the price climbs quickly. Leather trimmed interior with power seats alone adds about $2000. This is typical of Toyota�s pricing strategy � offer a low base price on a car with few features, then add option groups based on which features most consumers want. It is a good idea in theory. Somewhat of a bargain on the options list is a power sunroof/moon roof, at $500 it is a fraction of what other makes are charging for a power sunroof. Navigation system add another $2000, so it�s easy to see how the total sticker price of this test vehicle climbed to just over $36,000. My personal preference at that price would be the new ES300. And yet the IS and ES have about as much in common as a bowl of mashed potatoes and a cherry Coke. 

The IS is really a testament to how far Lexus has come in just over 10 years. They really do have a full line of cars and SUVs to choose from � with a wide range of prices.

Outside, the IS300 is a good looking car combining quasi-European styling with a decidedly street-racer/aftermarket look. Lexus� clear taillight lenses have every aftermarket company from California to Tokyo trying to copy the look. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Lexus should feel very flattered. 

The IS300�s interior is more �boy racer� than luxury car. Some used to Lexus� near perfect rendition of a luxury interior with their other cars may find the IS300 a little on the sparse side, but the interior does its job. Lexus is going for more cool and less opulence. Worth special mention is the ultra cool instrument cluster. The speedometer, tachometer and other engine readouts are arranged in a large circular manner with smaller gauges inside the larger circle. It looks like a giant, multi-function sports watch. The LED readout for gear selection is also arranged in a semi-circular manner. Too many automakers offer sleek exteriors while allowing the interior to be forgotten � the new Nissan Altima is a perfect example. If Nissan had put as much effort into the inside of their new Altima as Lexus has with the IS, the Altima would be even more appealing.

Rear seat room in the IS300 is lacking, kids will fit with no problem. Trunk is large enough, but nothing special

On the road the IS300 is clearly intended as a performance sedan in the same vein as the BMW 3-Series. There are luxury touches inside, but this car is all about tight handling and brisk acceleration. The E-shift version is especially fun on twisty back roads � equipped with a traditional automatic transmission, the IS300 E-shift version can be driven like a normal car. However, should your inner Walter Mitty get the best of you, you can control the transmission via steering wheel mounted buttons with which to up or down shift the car at what ever point you deem necessary. It�s not quite as much control as a manual transmission, but E-shift is a wonderful compromise between real world practicality and the fun of occasional spirited driving. The E-shift feature makes you feel as if you�re in a race car rather than a sport sedan.

The IS300 handles like a slot-car. The precision of this car�s cornering ability rivals makes such as BMW and Audi. The IS� canyon carving handling makes for a rather firm ride around town, but certainly not harsh. There is a solidity to this car that belies the stiff suspension. Still, if you�re expecting a pillow soft ride, skip the IS300. The wonderful Lexus GS430 makes this same attempt at splitting sport and luxury and seems to fall more on the luxury side. The IS300 makes the  attempt but is slightly more successful in that it seems to fall more on the sport side of things. The great thing about this car (especially the E-shift version) is what a great balance it really has. Serious sportiness without sacrificing too much practicality. 

Overall the Lexus IS300 proves that Lexus, and parent company Toyota, can build exciting, performance oriented cars when they really put their minds to it. The IS300 offers something that is often hard to find in a new car � serious performance without the usual compromises. Yes the IS has smallish rear seat, and yes priced with option it can be expensive. However, no more or less expensive than other cars in its class (i.e. BMW 3-series), but compared to cars like the Infiniti G20 or Mercedes C-Class, the real (and I hesitate to use this word for a $36,000 car) value is obvious.

Don�t get me wrong, other Lexus cars are incredibly luxurious (the GS430 is probably the best car under $100,000 period!) but they often lack pizzazz. That�s where the IS300 comes in � it�s all pizzazz. A stellar performance car hiding at your local luxury auto dealer.
