            If you are shopping for a nice-looking, affordable and reliable car...look no further.  
I recently purchased the 2000 Honda Civic EX 2-door Coupe and couldn't be happier with my decision.
This vehicle is fully-loaded with air conditioning, cd player, cruise control, automatic moon/sun roof, and dual front air bags.  
Not only do you get all these accessories with the EX package, you get a car with the Honda reliabilty that has existed for over 30 years.
You get everything from split fold-down rear seats to an adjustable drivers seat to a lockable trunk from the inside.  
The Honda Civic EX Coupe is a sporty car with plenty of leg room for passengers front and back and great visibility from all angles.  
It also gets good gas mileage both city and highway.
And best of all, the price is very affordable.  At around $15,000, the Honda Civic EX Coupe beats it's competition in safety, accessories and all-around drivablilty.
