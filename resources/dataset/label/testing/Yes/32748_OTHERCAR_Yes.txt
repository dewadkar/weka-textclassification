            Let's face it. When we think of sport car competition, we think of Camaro and Mustang. So which one is better? If you know your cars and know how to read the performance specs. in magazines, you will no it is the Chevrolet Camaro. Which one is faster? well the 2000 Camaro SS top speed in 160+ MPH!
The 2000 Mustang Cobra is 149MPH? Also the Camaro has much better aerodynamics. And I love that NACA forced air induction hood on the SS model. And who does not love that 5.7 litre 320hp Ls-1 V-8?
          I bought this 98 Camaro SS because I want a very sporty and muscular car. I want a powerful engine. And I wanted the best Bang for my Buck. And that statement is known world wide for the Camaro! When I was out for the test drive, I was sold! The driving experience is great! Imagine, leather everywhere! One hand one the leather wrapped steering wheel, and the other on the leather wrapped Hurst short-throw six speed gear shifter. Driving around town, with the Monsoon 500 watt stereo on, and the t-tops off. What an experience!

            So if you want to get the best for your money, buy a Camaro. And if you like to race, it will blow away the Mustangs! Or if you just want a sporty car, I highly recomend the 2000 Chevrolet Camaro. So test drive one today.<br><br>
