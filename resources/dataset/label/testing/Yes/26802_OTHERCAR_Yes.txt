            I'm a hard-core Pathfinder fanatic.  Mine is a 1990 XE model.  No matter what I'm doing, be it cruising, running errands, riding with friends, or off-roading, the Pathfinder handles everything I throw at it with ease.
For off-roading, it's got 2WD, 4WD high range, and 4WD low range.  I put 31x10.50 BFG Land Terrains on a few months ago.  These are all-terrain tires with a deep, aggressive tread.  With these tires, combined with power, I haven't needed the low-range much.  And trust me, I get deep and muddy when I off-road.  The shocks provide enough while leaving the off-road adventure an exciting ride, which is how it should be.
On-road, the Pathie performs well.  My 5-speed transmission lets me cruise fine, or do a little racing.  While it certainly isn't the fastest thing on the road, the Pathie does get out of the blocks well.  I love surprising people in little sports cars with how this muddy SUV can keep up.  It handles well around curves, as long as you're not being stupid about them.  Once in a while I accidentally peel out, but that's due to the amount of grip my tires are giving.  The only thing people may not like is that you can't really go above 70 mph.  Above that it starts getting bumpy.  However, I don't really remember the last time I needed to go above that, anyways.  Also, contrary to other reviews, I don't find engine noise at cruising speed to be much at all.
I've been driving my Pathfinder since October 2000.  Currently, it is over 12 years old.  In the time I've had it, I've had very little trouble.  I had a clutch slave cylinder problem, which was a very simple fix.  It needed a new muffler and exhaust, and recently a new water pump.  For a vehicle 12 years old, that's doing pretty well.  I'd suggest buying a Haynes manual for your model.  I have one that has been very helpful.  In fact, I've done most of my own repairs, including the clutch line.
On to the audio.  The Pathie came stock with a cassette player, 5.25" speakers in the front doors, and 6x9's in the trunk.  While nothing incredible, for that old it sounds good.  I currently have plans for all-new speakers, a new receiver, CD-changer, an amp, and a sub.  The Pathfinder, with its perfect size, provides a good base for this.
All in all, this is the perfect car.  As I mentioned, those who favor a Lexus or Cadillac will probably not like the Pathfinder, especially the older models such as mine.  However, for those of us who like adventure, the good-looking, capable, and rugged Pathfinder is the vehicle of choice.
