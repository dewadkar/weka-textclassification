            i own a 1995 toyota corolla. it has over 70,000 miles on it and its still going strong. i bought it new and have had it for over four years. it has had its little problems, nothing to serious to not fix, every car does. i am extremely happy that it has never had to have any major work done to it. i really lucked out with this car because i believe it still has several years of life left in it. its one of the great compact cars on the market. i believe it is best suited to be one of your kids first cars. it is really easy to drive and really easy to handle and for being the size that it is, it fits 4 people very comfortably. i totally recommend this car to anyone looking to buy something new or used. it is  great little car.<br><br>
