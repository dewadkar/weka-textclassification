            I bought the 1987 version, used, and it's a two door hatchback in red.  I bought this car even though I was looking for a four door station wagon in blue.  Why, you may ask, did I buy a car that didn't meet my aesthetic criteria?

At $3,000 the price was right.  It had no rust whatsoever, which is very important when considering the purchase of a Subaru.  It has over 100,000 miles on it, but-I can't stress this enough- this is not a big issue with Subarus.  The engine is superior in stamina to all engines I have ever dealt with.  These cars will go forever, it is the bodies that die from rust.  You could say that they are prone to skin cancer...

I also bought this car because it has four wheel drive, which comes in handy in Maine, where I live.  The gas mileage tends to be good on Subarus as well.

I love the fact that my car has been backed into, and survived.  I have been driven off the road into an embankment, sustaining only a cracked bumper.  I'd say this is one of the safest and most resilient cars I've ever owned.

I hate the fact that it is frightfully expensive to get parts and labor for this import.  I also hate the fact that it's a two door, but must admit that the hatchback area is generously proportioned.  I can haul quite a bit with this car.

I also must state that the pickup of the transmission in the lower gears leaves much to be desired.  No satisfactory explanation is yielded by any of the mechanics I've questioned regarding this.

This car is ideal for those who need a modest workhorse that is safe, will hold the road in difficult terrain, and will not suffer unexpected mechanical calamity.  This car is not a showpiece, but I recently had a sportscar fanatic drool openly at the sight of my car because it &quot;performs in the real world&quot;.

Driving this vehicle is a dependable, low maintenance way to go for those who need to get into and out of small parking spaces consistently.  It parallel parks like a dream.<br><br>
