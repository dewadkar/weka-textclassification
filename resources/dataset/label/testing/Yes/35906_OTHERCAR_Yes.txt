                       The BMW M3 Series is just spectacular. This car can almost maneuver any turns or obsticles while going at top speed of much more than 150!!!! Of course, it is never legal to drive that fast on the road but this can is designed to. It was basically born and designed on the race courses of Germany. Under the hood, there is a 240 HP engine (just HUGE) and everything else is just wonderful. One of the only cons about this racing car, is exactly that, it's a racing car. It was designed to speed the race tracks and not stroll down the backroads of your neighborhood. Sometimes just sitting in that car can give you the urge to speed and drive as fast as you can because of the sleek, racing-like design of this model. It wasn't exactly built for luxury, either. The front is perfect, roomy as can be, but the back seats are a different story. They are tight up against the front seats. But not to make you unsure about buying this car. I would defenatly recommend you buying it if you enjoy the feel of a BMW. This car might just be one of the greatest cars ever built.<br><br>
