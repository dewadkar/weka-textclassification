            We needed something for our expanding family.  We seem to have a lot of people with us a lot of the time.  It holds large and small sizes.  Plus cargo!  That is a plus.  I did research on what would be the best van for least repair and recall.  Consumer reports rated other vehicles, not vans, that we previously owned and sure enough they were duds.  With high marks for a Previa, I did more research online.  I couldn't find any recalls or any bad news for this vehicle.  
We picked ours up used.  We have put on new tires and a new battery. I love the way it drives.  It did take some getting used to the rather large windshield and the short front end. (I have only driven cars.) 
Put on the cruise control and relax for long trips.  Room to move around and carry things.  The seats all recline.  Even the rear ones.  I like the swivel seat.  Lots of cup holders.  Large glove compartment. 
The rear seats lift out of the way.  That was easy for me to do as I am a little person.  
Windows everywhere for all the kids to view the great scenes. Rear heat and a/c is so nice. Speakers are misplaced in my opinion but otherwise ok.  
We love this minivan!!!<br><br>
