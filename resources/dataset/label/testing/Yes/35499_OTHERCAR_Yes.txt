            With the third child on the way there was no doubt that a new vehicle capable of carrying several car seats was to be a necessity.  I spent many hours on the internet doing research and visited several dealerships for test drives.  In my opinion there is no equal to the Honda Odyssey.  While '98 and earlier models were poorly rated and basically no more than an Accord wagon with a higher ceiling, the '99 and 2000 models have been completely redesigned and offer superb features and function.

Numerous auto web sited allow side by side comparisons of different vehicles and I compared the Odyssey with its closest competitor, the Dodge Grand Caravan, and was astonished by the differences. The Honda has 25% more horsepower than the Dodge while still maintaining gas mileage significantly better than the Dodge.  The fold down seat in the Honda is exceptional.  It is amazing how much stuff will fit into the vehicle while still holding 7 passengers.  The ride is excellent and the engine is extremely powerful.  The automatic sliding doors are the most convenient item I could have imagined.

I would not dream of owning a minivan other than the Honda.  Anyone who takes the time to do the research and compare the minivan options will certainly come to the same conclusion.<br><br>
