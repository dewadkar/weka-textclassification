              It is true, the 60 Minutes fiasco of the '80s left a tarnished image for Audi. Audi had a very rough road ahead of them. Years of lackluster sales left the company wondering if they could survive in this country. In 1996 Audi brought us the A4. Since then everything has changed, for the better. I learned this on a recent test drive. The A4 blew me away!

Powertrain:   The 2.8 liter V6 with 190 horsepower is enough to move this car well even with the Quattro four wheel drive. The Quattro really makes this car stand out since almost none of the competition has anything like it except for the new BMW 330Xi, but that car cost a lot more. The Tiptronic automatic shifts smoothly. The enigne has a great sound to it, but at the same time is quiet.

Comfort:  Audi makes some great seats. The front seats are well designed and very supportive. Head and legroom are abundant even with a sunroof.In the rear, the seat is comfortable, but legroom is tight. The BMW 3 series has a bit more room back there.The trunk has a decent amount of room for this size of car.

Handling/steering/brakes:  This is one of the best handling sedans out there. The steering is razor sharp and body barely leans in the turns. The Quattro system offers piece of mind especially when the weather in not so good. Even though the A4 handles well iot still rides comfortably too. Audi really did their homework when they designed the suspension. The antilock brakes performed beautifully.

Styling: Audi has been turning out some artful designs. It started with this A4, then came the A6 and A8 and finally the TT. If any car company has its styling right its Audi. The A4 is my favorite. Its tidy proportions are sporty yet elegant. The interior is as artful is the exterior. Everything is of high quality.

Overall:  Audi has brought us a fantastic line of cars over the past four years. This is the car that started that trend. Even though its is a four year old design, it continues to excel in almost every area. And its Quattro system almost makes it pointless to consider a big clumsy SUV!<br><br>
