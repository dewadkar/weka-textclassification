            Note: This review applies to the European model of the car. Thus the price I have given is meaningless (different taxation, exchange rate).

This is my second Volvo and I have driven it for 2.5 years now. It replaced my sporty 480 because I needed more transportation room. I bought the wagon because of its looks and capacity and its sensible price compared to BMW, Mercedes or Audi who all sell comparable models.

The car has a 2.0 turbo engine (165 hp) and manual transmission.

To me it provides a great driving experience - acceleration, road-holding and agility are all great. I find it very comfortable up to 115 mph (this is allowed in some places in Europe). The suspension is thus firm, but still on the comfortable side of things. Ergonomics are very good overall, only the switches for the power windows are a bit oddly placed (but I almost never use them anyway). The gearbox is very good, comfortable and precise. Excellent brakes with capable ABS. Good manners even when fully loaded. Fuel economy is ok for this type of engine. For the thrifty spender there is a nice Diesel model available in Europe.

I have never been to the shop except for routine maintenance and repairs after an accident. Parts are on the expensive side.

The interior is comfortable (leather interior), most cloth upholstery versions are simply revolting, but this has improved in later model years I understand. It's a bit no-frills, no feature-overload, but it gives me everything I want. The integrated children seats are absolutely great - ever had to give a lift to another child but had no proper seat? These fold out of the back bench - they are not noticeable when they are folded back.

After 2.5 years one or two noises have added to the engine growl, but nothing serious although I am a bit touchy there.

The cargo compartment is sufficiently roomy and can be expanded with folding rear and passenger seats. An extra safety belt helps keeping heavy objects at bay (remember the good breaks). The opening is a bit high but that's a concession to safety.

This IS a safe car - I had three crashes of various sorts with my two Volvos - there was never any problem. For the sake of my family I prefer that.
