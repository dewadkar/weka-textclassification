            Most people want to get the most for their money, correct? Most people dream of having the best, but think there's no package that has everything you could want for a low price. Well, there wasn't... until 1999.

Acura made a hell of a comeback for 1999. They ditched the slow-selling 2.5TL and redesigned the 3.2TL. This time, they put every single "option" in one package and made it "standard". Tired of being bullied by Lexus and Infinity, they decided it was time to go all out.

Let's start with the sound system:

Sound By Bose. When you see those words, you can prepare yourself for the most lifelike music experience ever, from the most respected name in sound. No, it won't blow the windows out of the car. No, it won't satisfy teenagers or audiophiles. But for the mature adult-world, it doesn't get much better. There are 4 Bose speakers, one in each door. On the rear-deck there is a Bose Subwoofer. The sound is crisp and crystal clear. You will swear that the person singing the song is somewhere in the car.

Okay, you can have Bose with the Infinity. You can have Nakamichi with the Lexus. These cars all have fantastic sound systems, so what sets the Acura apart? Let's move on.

Headlights:

Xenon High-Intensity Discharge (HID) headlights were not offered on the Lexus or Infinity in 1999. In 2000, the Lexus offered them as an option. The Infinity made them standard in 2002. The Acura, starting with 1999 and going to the present, has made them standard. You will not find a 1999+ TL without them. There's no real way to describe the effect of HID headlights, you would just have to drive a car with them to understand. They pierce the night with a daylight-white light with a slight blue tinge. They light up the road farther ahead and farther from side to side than standard Halogen headlights. You will never want to drive a car without them again.

So, plus one for Acura. The only one of this trio to have Xenon HID as standard (in 1999). It's nice to report that HID is standard on the new Lexus and Infinity.

Engine:

Lexus and Infinity were almost there, but not quite. The Acura offered a sophisticated 3.2L VTEC V6 with 225HP and 216TQ. It doesn't actually make it a sports sedan, but it can definitely move out of its own way. Most power in it's class. 

Plus two for Acura.

Transmission:

A clutch and 5-speed manual isn't available in any of these cars. They are all automatics, or are they? The Lexus is, with it's Camry-like shifter. The Infinity is, too. The Acura has a gated shifter with it's automatic, but pull the shifter over and you've now got a manual. There's no clutch, so you can't grind any gears. The car will not let you over-rev the engine, either. It's a manual transmission for those who don't like manual transmissions. Acura calls this SportShift. A digital display within the tachometer tells you what gear you are in. Of course, you can always leave it in D4 and it will shift for you crisply and quickly.

Plus three for Acura, only one to offer SportShift.

The winner is the 3.2TL -- and to top it all off, it's also the cheapest of the three.

You get heated leather seats, heated power mirrors, HID, Bose Sound System, Traction Control System, ABS 4-discs, SportShift transmission, 3.2L VTEC V6, Auto Climate, and a host of other things. Shopping for a used one is painless, as all are equipped the same (except for optional navigation system).

Do not pass up the Acura without a test drive. What's it like to drive, you say?

Starting from the moment you sit in the supple-leather driver's seat you feel at home. Controls are laid out in the very places you expect them to be. Ergonomically, this is as perfect as the Accord it is based on.

The differences between the TL and the Accord become apparent as soon as you hit the road, though. While the Accord is predictable, stable, and has good reflexs -- the Acura bests it in every category. The 1998-2002 Accord V6 engines were unimpressive and weak, but the 3.2L V6 in the Acura is a gem. It has adequate power no matter what speed you are travelling when you jab the throttle. The transmission shifts quickly and does not "hunt" for the right gear on inclines. 

The Acura accelerates quickly without straining, and it has uncanny stability at high speeds. In a panic stop, the ABS chatters louder than the ES300 or I30, but it gets the job done with good pedal feel. ABS is used almost in reverse for the Traction Control System (TCS). If the wheels begin to slip upon start-off, the TCS pumps the brakes to the wheel spinning. I didn't get the chance to test the TCS, but I assume it could only aid the car in slippery conditions.

All in all, the car is a pleasure to drive. It has the intimacy of a sports car, but room for all friends. The Acura is a shining example of Honda's ingenuity.
