               This car, the Volvo 940 is a great car that many people are missing.  Because of the good pick-up and slightly sporty look, the Volvo 940 is a cool car out on the road.  I am looking at Volvos right now, and the best Volvo I have found is the 940.  I have looked at the 850s, 740s, 240s, and the 760s and to compare the Volvos I have to say that the 940 surpasses all the other's is style, comfort, options and saftey.  I am about to by a 940 with 150,000 miles.  That's how confident I am about the engine and other parts of the car.  <br><br>
