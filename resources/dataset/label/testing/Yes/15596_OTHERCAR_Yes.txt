            I fell in love with the Mavica concept (a floppy-disk based system) when I took a trip with a newly-purchased FD-7 to Switzerland, Italy and Germany. I brought a powerbook with me, two batteries, and the universal charger that Sony includes with all Mavica cameras. I took over 600 photos over two weeks. Each night, I would copy the floppies to my hard-drive, and review the day's events. Because of the lack of incremental cost, I took a lot of photos that I wouldn't have if I were paying film processing costs. One feature of the FD-7 that I absolutely loved was that it took excellent photos in low light.  I was able to take photos inside the restricted Vasari Corridor in the Uffizi gallery in Florence, because I didn't need a flash. The other fantastic feature is the optical 10x zoom. The main drawback is the very low resolution of the camera: the FD-7 is only 640 x 480. (yes, so far this is is a mini-review of the fantastic little FD-7, but read on...)

So, when I heard the FD-91 was coming out with 1024 x 768 resolution and a 14x zoom, I was very interested. I sold my FD-7, and bought a FD-91, and have been 90% happy with the upgrade. The extra resolution is really nice. In the right conditions, the image quality is very good, dot for dot, sometimes better than the FD-7. The 14x zoom with steadyshot allows me to take photos of things that would require a huge amount of equipment (long lenses, tripod) with a normal camera. The MPEG movie mode is fun every now and then, but in no way obviates a video camera. 

The downsides are that, for a $950 piece of electronics, it doesn't have a really high-quality feel.  The plastics around the lens are slightly soft, and kind of creak. It's a lot bulkier than the other Mavicas, and doesn't have their quaint &quot;Brownie camera&quot; look. More seriously, however, is that every Mavica since the FD-7 seems to have a different imaging system, which reduces their quality in low light. In particular, the FD-91, even at 640x480 resolution, looks grainy in anything but reasonably full light. I was originally hoping for a 100% upgrade over the quality of the FD-7, but this aspect is definitely a step backward. Not that the FD-91 is awful in low-light -- in fact, I have been able to take indoor photos without flash that challenged film photographers with fast color film. It's just that the FD-7 would have done better.

All in all, anyone buying a digital camera these days is an early adopter.  There is no perfect digital camera. Each one has tradeoffs.  I love the resolution of the Nikons, but memory cards for them are so expensive and 3x zoom Just Isn't Enough.  The Mavicas' floppy and long-life rechargeable batteries are fantastic for long trips, and the 14x zoom is the most powerful in the industry, but the photos just aren't as sharp or accurate as some other cameras. For my purposes, though, which are mainly to put photos on-line, the FD-91 is just about right.

I can't wait for 5 years from now when $1,000 will buy a digital camera with an ASA of 400, interchangeable lenses, 6000 x 4000 resolution, and cheap mass storage. Until then, my FD-91 and pocketful of floppies will keep me pretty happy.<br><br>
