            I would defiantly recommend the Chevy S-10 to anyone who is looking for 

a cheap yet dependable truck.  It is not a massive truck you can haul 

stuff in but you can do practically things in.  I do not own a chevy S-10 

but my dad as one to work in.  He reads gas meters and is very rough on a 

truck.  But the chevy S-10 has held up to his abuse very well.  He 

drives it four hours non-stop and then another four hours non-stop.  He 

has had no trouble out of it yet and he has put almost 18,000 miles on it 

since February.  I have drove this truck and it handles very well I 

would not mind to own one myself.  It is fairly roomy for a small 

pickup.  The only thing I do not care for is how the dash on the 

passengers side sticks out to better suit the driver and it in turn 

crowds the other passenger.  I would recommend this truck for someone 

wanting a nice truck to drive around and not haul to big of loads with.
