            I got the 89 Colt Vista Wagon when I got back into field service.  I'm not big on new cars, so I was looking for something cheap and reliable.  This car certainly seems to be both.
I've put a few thousand miles on it with no major repairs, and only a few minor ones.  All the sort of things I expect to do on used cars over 10 years old.  I had the timing belt replaced right away as a general precaution, and one of the CV joints was replaced by the dealer, but other than that, it survived its first owner almost totally original.  It may be nearing time for a bit more work on the suspension, as even with new tires, it gets slightly shaky a little over 70mph.
The air conditioning leaves a lot to be desired in the Texas heat, but at full blast, it will keep the front seat occupants cool enough.  The factory stereo was pretty good, but AM/FM only, so I swapped it out pretty quickly.
The electrical system has a few quirks I discovered while putting some more powerful horns and a ham radio in, but they're nothing that the average driver would ever need to be concerned with.
Overall, I'd say it's a good car with a lot of space, and police hardly ever give it a second glance, which is handy with my lead foot.
