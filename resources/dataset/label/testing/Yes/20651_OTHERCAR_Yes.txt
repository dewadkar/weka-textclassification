            I bought my 1996 A6 Quattro sedan in October 1996. The main reason I bought the car was its incredibly sumptuous interior, which I feel is better than the interior of both the BMW 5 series and any class of Mercedes.

I have had absolutely zero problems with the car since I bought it, and have especially enjoyed its AWD capabilities in the Sierra Nevadas during ski season(the ability to put skis in the car using the rear seat ski hatch has been helpful).  I've been getting about 17MPG in the city and 22 on the highway, and it's burned very little oil(1 quart every 8000 miles). 

Again, if you're looking for an interior to enjoy, look no further. Audi's craftsmanship is better than either BMW or Mercedes; and with the 4.2L 300HP version of the A6 set to ship in early 2000, this will be a car to outdue the 540 and the S420 across all metrics.
