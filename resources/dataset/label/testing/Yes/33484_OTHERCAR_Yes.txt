            I have had this car for 10years and purchased it new.  I purchased it in 1992 as a leftover and it has been great!
It has 148,000 miles and I have never been left stranded in it.  I would like to keep it another year but it is starting to give me some problems.   A couple of years ago it started to burn some oil and now I have to put a quart in every couple of weeks.  Although, I started to put heavier weight oil in it and I don't have to add it as often.  I changed the alternator once and just changed the battery for the second time, I think.  I am not that good to it, changing the oil once and a while may be why it burns some oil.  I tune it up once in a blue moon.  Oh, yea once I could not use the clutch and just made it to my friends shop and he fixed something under the hood.  I don't remember what it was he replaced but it didn't cost that much, maybe $125.00. Of course things like brakes have to be maintained but I never had to replace calipers for anything like that.

Lately, though she has been giving me some trouble (you can see I am getting emotional), not starting in the moist weather, probably the wires, they are the originals so I probably should replace them already.  I am trying to change the heater core right now and having a heck of a time getting to it and that is why I am on line now trying to figure out how to get to it.  

Another thing, the exhaust is stainless steel and I have never changed any of it!!!

My wife is trying to tell me to let my baby go and get a new car now, maybe a Ford Escape but I am not sure if I can.........
