            We purchased this vehicle because our old car was stolen.  The good side to this car, is that is a roomy car for normal/average adults.  I am 5'10&quot; and the only problem I have driving it, is getting my knees under the steering column.  The only major problem we have had is the air conditioner, and it fixed itself.  The car drives very easily, accelerates hard, and brakes and turns pretty well.  This would be a good starter car, or small, maybe 2 person family car.  If you are over 5'10&quot; tall, I would suggest a larger car, as this vehicle is a compact. <br><br>
