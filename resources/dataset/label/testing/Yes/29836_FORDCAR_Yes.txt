            Let me begin by stating that I have very little knowledge of cars in general.  What this review will focus on are the 2 Ford Escorts which have made appearances in my life.

<b>Round number 1</b>
When I was 16, my mother bought me a used 1986 Ford Escort 2-door hatchback.  The car was 7 years old at that point, though had fairly reasonable mileage at around 60,000 miles.  The body was in excellant condition, and the interior, while less than stellar, was really not in terribly bad shape either.  Unfortunately, those were about the only things that <i>weren't</i> wrong with it.
The day after we signed the papers and brought it home, it decided it didn't want to start.  I couldn't even get the engine to turn; when I would turn the key, it simply clicked and did nothing more.  It turned out that I had a defective ignition switch, which was fairly simple to fix, but I felt that shouldn't have been neccessary on what was, to me, a new car that had been purchased from a dealership.  Not too long after that, I discovered that if it rained, the car would not start until it had sufficient time to dry out.  It would crank and crank and crank, but it absolutely would not start.  This of course did not bode well for rainy days.
A few months later, when I would start the car, the engine would rev continuously for about 10 minutes before settling in to a normal idle.  I was never able to determine the problem here and this continued until I got rid of it.
Then, I began having fairly serious problems with my radiator-- it wasn't doing a sufficient job in cooling my engine.  I took it for repairs, yet the problem persisted and some days, including hot summer days, I'd have to drive around with the heat on full blast to pull excess heat off the engine.  It was about this time that I decided I was spending entirely too much money on this peice of junk and I traded it in(a whopping $300 trade value) for a Nissan Sentra.

<b>Round number 2</b>
After my first experience with a Ford Escort, I swore I'd never own or drive one again, but as things would have it...
Last fall, our car(a Dodge Sundance) died from complications of the transmission.  As my husband requires a car for work, we needed to replace it ASAP, and went car shopping the next day.  As we weren't exactly expecting to have to purchase a new car at the time, we had to settle for what we could afford-- that being another Ford Escort.  This one is a 1996 model 2-door hatchback.  It's body and interior were in pristine condition and it handled wonderfully(and has good shocks, something my previous one did not).  We test drove it and ultimately brought it home and while I'm still a bit leery, we have not, so far, experienced any problems with it in the nine or so months we've had it.  The only work we've had done to it is routine stuff(new tires and oil changes).  It has fairly high miles for it's age(87,000), but it doesn't seem to be displaying any signs of distress yet.  It is a manual and gets very good gas mileage(about twice what we were getting with the Sundance, which was an automatic).  Over the winter, my husband had a minor run in with a guard rail(courtesy of an icy road) and what I noticed as a result of that is that the newer models don't appear to have quite as tough of a body on them.  My old one was rock solid and it took a good deal of force to damage the body(as well as the paint).  This new one barely even touched the guard rail, yet came home with a tennis ball sized dent in the side and a good scrape in the paint halfway down the length of the car.
Overall, I'm pretty happy with this newer one, even though I keep expecting something to happen to it any day now that will cost us billions of dollars like my old one did.  But, I'm willing to give it a chance, as so far, it's proving itself to be a pretty decent little car.<br><br>
