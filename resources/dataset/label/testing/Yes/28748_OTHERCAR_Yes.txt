            Was shocked when I first test drove this car.  The turbo really kicks in and you will never ever have any problems coming up to speed on the freeway onramps or passing cars on rural highways.  I'm still too scared to see how fast it will go. Haven't even come close to maxing it out.  Bottom line is this thing has power throughout the entire RPM range.  The car feels solid.  The interior makes you feel like you're in a cockpit of an airplane.  Really cool blue and red lights/gauges.  It definitely feels like a much higher quality vehicle than it's Japanese counterparts.  It also looks great!  I'm a sound system freak.  I went to school for audio engineering.  And I think the Monsoon system you can get with your Jetta is great.  This will be the first time I'll leave the factory stereo system alone.  Power everything in the GLS 1.8T with Luxery package.  (Including power sunroof)  I can't stop talking about how much I love this car.  A few things I dislike are the cup holders.  They cover up my CD player.  I have to take my drinks out and juggle it in my lap if I want to change CD's.  If you are tall like me, you can forget about having rear passengers.  Your seats will be pushed all the way back.  And be sure to really take care of the cloth seats.  They attract lint like nobody's business.  I keep a lint brush in the door pocket.  Otherwise, this car is awesome.  You'll love it.
