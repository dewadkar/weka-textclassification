            We bought our 1991 GMC Safari brand new in January of 1991.  We were in a car accident in December of 1990 and our car was totaled so I told my husband....no more cars....buy a van.  

Ours is a conversion van with the TV, remote control, all captain chairs...you know, the &quot;sitting in your living room but really in your van&quot; vehicle.  We only use it on vacations since I have a '94 Ford Explorer and my husband has a '95 Chevrolet truck that we use for our day to day driving.  

The van is respectfully referred to as the &quot;Senior Bus&quot; . . . since my husband's hair is snow white (but he's not a senior, just premature grey) and my parents LOVE to see &quot;the bus&quot; pull up and we go off for the day.  Thus, SENIOR (for my parents) bus.  They're very comfortable in the back and we even have passengers in the very back bench seat.  That seat comes out or lays down for extra storage space.  

The four of us went on vacation for 2 weeks in the van and covered 13 states in 14 days and felt like we were sitting in the lap of luxury the entire time.  And the frosting on the cake?  The van gets better gas mileage than the truck OR the Explorer!!<br><br>
