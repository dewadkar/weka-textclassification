            I have driven my Bronco II for about 3 or 4 years now and have had only a few minor problems with it considering it is a 1986 model. Ford makes some of the most dependable 4-wheel drive vehicles on the market I think this qualifies as one of the best first cars for your 16 year old child. It teaches them how to take care of a car that will have its problems but won't break down after a couple hours of driving. My car has never broken down and has been capable of taking a pounding. I drove this car through my deer lease with ease and without having to worry how much damage it will sustain because it can take a good beating without falling apart. It also has a lot of storage space, my cousin John, my freind Daniel and I all went down in this 2 door Suv and still had enought room to fit all our gear and my 2 12&quot; subs in a 3' x 1' q-logic bandpass box, and nothing was damaged or smashed. The 2 back seats fold down to allow more cargo storage and the easy opening back get allow for easy access to the equipment you carry. Also this 2.9 liter v6 engine got us up and down huge hills and ditches that blocked our path. The 4-wheel drive also became a necessity going up a ditch that most suv wouldn't make because of Fords superb 4-wheel drive capabililities. I bought my Bronco II xlt with all power windows, locks, power steering, power brakes automatic, 4-wheel drive, A/C, am/fm cassette player, and quality sound for under $3000. The price is just right for that biginning driver.<br><br>
