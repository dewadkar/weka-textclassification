            My husband and I decided to buy a new car when our son was a month old. He had been to different dealerships looking for something I would like. He came home and told me all about a Mazda Protege he had found. My first reaction was, &quot;NO!&quot; You see, my husband already has a 1990 Protege. Although he claims his car is very reliable, I disagree. And I definitely did not want another one. Now, my husband's car was used when he purchased it. It had been wrecked and he has wrecked it again himself. So, I was totally against buying a Protege. We went to a few dealerships and looked at many different cars. 

I had a few VERY important things that I must have in a car-  child-proof locks, power windows &amp; locks, spacious back seat that would accommodate a child's car seat or maybe two, and a spacious trunk that would easily accommodate our stroller. I found all of these and more in the Protege. 

As soon as I took one look at this car, I knew I just had to have it. First of all, it was my favorite color- RED! It included an AM/Fm CD player, cup holders, cruise, air tilt, power brakes, power steering, and front wheel drive. This is the ultimate car. I wanted something that said &quot;Mommy&quot;, but also said, &quot;I'm only 21!&quot; This car says both! Not only does this car look great, it rides very smoothly. I absolutely LOVE driving this car. I truly believe we made the best decision in purchasing the 1999 Mazda Protege. I would &amp; do recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a new car! <br><br>
