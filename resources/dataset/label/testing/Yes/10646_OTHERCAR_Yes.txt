            I've always wanted a Corvette for about as long as I can remember.  On January 15, 2001 I made that dream a reality.  I didn't know too much about the Corvette particulars at that time but in the year since I've owned it I've come to learn a lot.

1992 was the first year of the LT1 engine, it was rated at 300 hp as opposed to the earlier L98 engine.  The LT1 is far superior in overall drivability and it will pull hard all the way to the rev-limiter (5700 rpms) Where the L98 motor simply ran out of breath at about 4500 rpms.  LT1 doesn't make the raw off the line torque of the L98, but it more than makes up for it on the top end.

As the first year for a new engine, people tend to think that the 92 has some strange quirks.  Nothing could really be farther than the truth.  There have certainly been some changes to the LT1 motor over the years, but none very drastic.  The reliability of the motor has not been affected at all by these minor changes and revisions.  In fact overall the car has changed for what some would consider to be the worse over the years.

To determine if the car has changed for better or worse, you need to look at what you use the car for.  If you want all out performance, handling, and control, you need the 92.  Later years made slightly more power, but the 92 had the best standard options in that field.  For example the 92 came standard with 275/40/17 tires all around.  Later years had narrower tires up front with slightly wider tires in the back.  Not only does this mean that you cannot rotate the tires, but it means that the car's handling balance is shifted for the worse.  Luckily in later years GM maintained the "performance handling" package that included 275/40/17's on all 4 corners.

Another change that has taken place has to do with the seats.  In the later C4 years the seats were redesigned to make it easier to enter and exit the car, the compromise is that the seats do not support the driver and passenger as well during high speed handling runs.  Also the suspension got softer with every year.  The 92 is even far softer than the 84, but the difference in power really negates the handling differences.

From another perspective there are a great deal of people who like to modify their cars, myself included.  I'm not so interested in visual mods as I am performance.  Again the LT1 shines in this regard.  For approximately $2500 in modifications I have gone from making 269 rear wheel horsepower and 300 pounds of torque to 336 rear wheel horsepower and 345 pounds of torque.  This is not too bad for just a few minor internal engine modification, such as a cam, on stock cylinder heads.

The Chevrolet build quality has never been the best, so expect some rattles.  This is about the only thing that has improved over the years.

In the time I've owned the car the only problems I have had are a broken belt and a dead battery.  Not too bad for a 10 year old car.
