            First off let me say that I love this car.  It is a blast to drive around town, and it gets GREAT gas mileage.  there are just a couple things that keep this little deuce coupe from being perfect though.
#1 Rear seat headroom is Non-existent.  If you plan on using the rear seats often look elsewhere.
#2 because the rear window is so slanted it makes any rear speaker work near impossible unless you own the convertible.
#3 The general lack of power below 3000 RPM is almost un-acceptable.

Now onto the good things.
#1 Tight parking spaces?  No problem.
#2 As soon as the tach hits 4000 the real fun begins, and it Doesn't have that whiny sound of Hondas when they rev.
#3 The body style.  Put some nice 15's and a sports bra on this bad boy and your set.
#4 Rock solid reliability.  These things will rarely be in the shop.

Overall though if you need more than a commuter car, or a small car to zip you around on the weekends you might want to look at bigger models.<br><br>
