            My husband, two children and I cramped into a small compact car for about three years.  When our third little one came we could take it no more.  We chose the Mitsubishi Montero Sport.  We are both still relatively young and like to do things like go camping and fishing.  We go to a lot of conferences with our church and need cargo space for hauling sound equipment around.  With the Mitsubishi Montero Sport we have the versatility of a family car, and a sporty, fun weekend getaway vehicle.  My two toddlers fit securely in their seatbelts while my baby is tucked safely in her carseat.  I sit up front with dad in comfort and style.  Not to say I don't know what the back seat is like. We pick up a friend every week for church and he is a &quot;large&quot; man I let him sit in front and I sit in the back seat.  I have to say the back seat although not as comfortable as the front, is a very comfortable ride.  I can still enjoy the music and conversation as well as the smooth ride I normally get up front. 

The only drawback I can see to this vehicle is the gas mileage.  Since it is an SUV it has a tendency to really use up gas quickly.  With gas prices the way they are today, it takes about $25.00 to fill up the tank.  My husband uses it to drive to and from work everyday (about 75-80 miles a day), and we fill up about 2 times a week for his commute.  So this can be expensive for a young family of five. But this drawback is not something you'll find just in the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, this is common to most luxury vehicles, larger Sedans, as well as SUV's.

I would recommend this vehicle to you if you are single, or married with a small family.  If you're in the market for a new vehicle, test drive a few of the four door Sedans and then check out the Montero Sport.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  We were.

I am now expecting our fourth child so I guess it's time to trade up.  It's going to be a full size Montero for us next.
