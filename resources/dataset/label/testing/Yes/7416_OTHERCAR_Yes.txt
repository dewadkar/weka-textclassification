            I was one of the so called early adapters when digital camera's were introduced. Actually my first digital camera was a Casio. At that time image quality was very poor.

After having the Casio replaced by a Canon Powershot S20 I decided to go for the big professional stuff. I have had a Nikon D100 as well as a Nikon D1X. Although their specifics are not to be compared with the Casio (6 M.pixels) I never really liked them. Probably has to do with my qualities as photographer ;-). After having had to carry around the bulky professional Nikon's I wanted something small with  good looks.

I have looked at the Sony U-series which are very very small. So was the LCD screen on those (approx 2x2 cm). And they used Sony's memorystick. I dislike Sony's own standards. So I looked at other small camera's like Minolta but absolutely fell-in love with the Casio Z-3. It is the right size and looks great.

The picture quality of the pictures is amzing. Although the resolution is less then the Nikon's I am somehow more able to shot pictures that look professional. 

Color's are so vibrant: Red is really red and intense. Cobalt blue really is cobalt, etc. With other camera's I had to do some post processing for some pictures to look right. With the Casio they are the way they should be when shot.

Battery life with all other camera's I had was a bad experience for me. I frequently had to recharge. Apparently Casio has found a way to fix this. During my recent holiday I never ever had a moment that the battery let me down. Even though I frequently forgot to charge it.

Last but not least is the optical & digital zoom. There are no camera's of this size which have a 3x optical zoom. Also it has a digital zoom to extend its range even further. The algorithm which is used for the digital zoom to enhance picture quality is great. Although its best not to use a digital zoom at all, with the Z-3 the results are very good.

To conclude: I've had quite some camera's. This is the first one I am soo happy with that if it got stolen I would buy it again. Never had that with any other camera.
