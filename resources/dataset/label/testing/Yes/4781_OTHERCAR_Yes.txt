            Do not purchase a minivan from Russ Darrow in Madison, WI.  They are very unprofessional.  1) You will not get the van you want 2) You will not get the price you want  3) This dealer does not know how to negotiate.

We test drove a van on Saturday, went back to to pick it up Monday and they said it was sold from underneath us.  It is still on their lot.  They also lied to us when they said they had no base Grand Voyageurs...they had three.

My advice...stay away from these guys, and shop across town or Milwaukee.
