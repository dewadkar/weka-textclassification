            We bought a 1999 Accord EX-V6 brand new in October of 1998. Now almost three years old, we have had no problems with the car although it has only 25,000 miles.

After happily owning a 1991 Accord, I talked my wife into a 1997 Mazda 626. After less than two years she was unimpressed with the Mazda so we sold it and got her back into an Accord. 

Since we do a lot of freeway driving, we did not consider the 4-cylinder Accord-- her 1991 seemed a little underpowered for freeway merging and noisy when pushed hard. We decided on the EX V-6 with a strong 200 HP engine and automatic transmission. The EX V-6 comes standard with plenty of luxury extras, such as leather, sunroof, power everything, climate control and an in-dash CD player.

Overall we have been very happy with the Honda. It has never caused any problems and has only been to the shop for scheduled maintenance. Reliability has always been Honda's strong suite and this model is no exception.

I only have a couple of complaints on this model. The car is prone to a lot of road/tire noise at highway speeds. If you take many long trips you might want to consider a Maxima or something more quiet. We are still riding on the OEM Michelin tires but I don't think they are the cause. I have seen similar comments on this model in auto magazine reviews. The seats seem fine at first but on a long trip I found it hard to get comfortable (despite power controls for many adjustments) and got out with a backache.

Also, the factory CD player functions well but has a "tinny" sound. To get any bass at all, the bass knob must be turned all the way up and even then you don't get much. I have heard Bose systems in other cars in this price range and they sound much better, I think Honda skimped on the speakers.

Finally, the paint job on this car drives me crazy. Granted, it is black and that is the toughest color to keep looking good. But, it seems to get swirls and fine scratches despite zealous care and the use of premium waxes and polishes. The dealer applied a "paint sealant" coating before we bought the car and this could be a contributing factor. Also, the flat surfaces have some pits that perhaps could be from acid rain or something during transit (I noticed them right after we got it). If I didn't think the car would come out worse I probably would have had the dealer repaint some of it under warranty. But my experience has been that the worst factory paint job is always better than what the dealer will do in a body shop !! Perhaps I am just too picky and to the casual observer the finish is OK.

As reliable (and somewhat classy) transportation, the Accord is hard to beat, especially the top of the line EX V-6. It is really a poor man's Acura. But, if you do a lot of highway driving, I advise a highway test drive to see if you are bothered by the road noise. There are many competitors to the Honda in this class that might suit you better.
