            I purchased my 1987 Saab for $6,000 in 1992 with 47k miles on it.  It was initially chosen for the unique and sporty look.  It is red in color and catches looks and comments everywhere you go.  Tons of room for hauling things.  We have used it through several moves and to carry trees home from the nursery.  It is fantastic in the snow - I have actually plowed through snow up to the top of the hood.  It is a very heavy and sturdy car.  Because of this, I feel very safe in this car.

The downside?  About three years ago the repairs started to hit.  Finding a mechanic who is used to working on Saabs is tough.  Also, the price of parts is very high (e.g. - motor for ONE electric window - over $300).  For the last several years, we have put out about $2000 a year for repairs.  The air conditioning and heated seats no longer work.

In a nutshell - great car but expensive repairs.  I would recommend it to anybody who is prepared for the high cost repairs.<br><br>
