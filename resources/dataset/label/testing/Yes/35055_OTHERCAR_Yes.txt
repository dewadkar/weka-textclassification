            I looked long and hard and read lots of reviews on the Disco II as it's known. It was such a great looking truck but seemed to get a bad write up. I bit the bullet and found a 2000 Disco II with leather, two roofs, CD changer etc. The vehicle had 63,000km's, and was still under manufacturers warranty.

I have driven this truck for 11000km's and I'm impressed. There is lots of space inside, great visibility. Yes, the windshield is a little low for some traffic lights but it kinda helps with the sun, so it's a trade.

It does have some quirky points like the interior door handles, front cup holders and the the size of the rear door openings but you adjust to those things fairly quickly. I wouldn't use those as reasons not to buy one.

I have taken this vehicle off-road(mild) and it works really well, especially the Descent Control.

If you are considering buying a used 2000 I would try and find one with over 60000km's. The reason being that the 4 year warranty will soon expire, regardless of mileage, and they need to have been used enough to break some things under warranty. This vehicle has had a rad, wiper motor, rockers, rear door hinges and some front light wiring. These are things that go wrong as this year was the switch over from the Series I and had a few poor parts suppliers.

I have had great service from the dealer but once out of warranty either do the oil change yourself or find someone who can because the dealers aren't cheap.

I do a mix of highway and town driving and get an average of 20mpg. That's Canadian gallons.

The kids love this vehicle. I think they get a kick out of the fact that none of their friends have one and they can see out when strapped into the rear seats.
