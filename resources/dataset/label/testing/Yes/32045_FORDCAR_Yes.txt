            I have had a 1996 Explorer XLT with 4WD for just over 4 years and it has been the best car(truck) I have ever owned. It has 83000 trouble free miles on it. The only part replaced other than periodic maintenance items, tires, brakes, oil, filters, etc. has been an oxygen sensor. The truck gets over 18mpg during the summers here in the Chicago area and even gets 15 during the winter in 4wd. I originally bought this vehicle when I moved to the frozen tundra from Fl. trading in my Nissan 300ZX sports car and it has performed flawlessly. When I was looking at other types of SUV's the salesmen would say that their product was just as good as the Explorer so I tried it and they were wrong the Explorer was better. I am going to definitely replace it with another. The truck is still a truck able to haul stuff inside and on the roof so it handles like a truck and has a truck style ride which is the biggest drawback that I can see. When you drive this truck you are higher above the traffic and can see better, that in itself makes it safer in addition to it's size.<br><br>
