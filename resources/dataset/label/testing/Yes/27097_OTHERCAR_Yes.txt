            My Husband bought a black Viper ACR.  It's a beautiful automobile.  After he purchased it I realized why it was his DREAM car!!  If you feel the need for speed, this is the car.  If you don't mind lots of attention from complete strangers, this is the car.  And if you want to get where you're going in about half the time, effortlessly, this is the car.
At first, I was very timid about driving it, especially after looking under the hood and subsequently loosing myself in an hysterical laugh for 30 minutes because I had never seen anything so monolithic in a vehicle before, referring to the engine. Now, I feel confident enough to drive it, but, I never loose respect for it's power. But, I get the most enjoyment sitting in the passengers seat.  You see, I LOVE roller coaster rides!!
