            I have had my LHS for one year now, and have over 20k miles.  I have had ZERO problems.  No squeaks.  No loose bolts.  It rides beautifully, excellent pickup.  Great radio/CD/tape player.  Love the built in garage door remote, and heated leather seats.  One complaint is that its tough to wash the inside of the windshield because of the cab forward design. You have to be somewhat of a contortionist, but otherwise I can't say anything bad about the car.  Its the first Chrysler I have owned ( I'm not counting my 59 Plymouth Fury that I bought when I was 18), and I don;'t think it will be my last.<br><br>
