            As I mentioned in my last 2002 Kia Spectra review, I traded that car for the above vehicle and have about 1125 miles on the clock thus far.
 
My first impression: A++! Extremely positive. This vehicle is a step up in size for me(to mid-size) and also in "the bells & whistles" department. This car is the "base" Optima LX with a 4-cylinder motor (2.4L, 146hp) with the 4 speed Automatic w/"Sport Mode" shift option sitting on 205X15" wheels.

The Optima comes standard fairly full of goodies: Air, tilt, power windows/locks/mirrors, disc brakes all around, cruise, AM-FM/CD, handy gas and trunk release buttons (not levers), a Sub-Key (I never knew they existed) and on and on!
 
The seats are large & comfortable. The car is far roomier, obviously, than a Spectra.  Kia does a nice job with all that space, including great comfy cloth on the furniture and extra cup holders front and rear, 40-60 split fold-down rear seats, nice arm rests, map lights, lighted vanity mirrors in the visors, visor extensions, etc).
 
I am truly enjoying the Automatic transmission. It is smooth, quiet and precise, and, if I get to feeling like Barney Oldfield, I can move the lever to "Sport Mode" and do all the shifting myself (but no clutching). I will be having knee surgery soon and so I wanted the Automatic transmission as well as a larger cabin/cockpit to get in and out of.
  
Bottom line, it feels extremely luxurious to me. It's quiet in the cabin, the ride is nice and it feels BIG. When you close the doors, they make that solid "whoomp" sound.

As far as the outside appearance goes, I got a warm, rich-looking Ruby Red car that gets kinda dirty quickly but looks like a million bucks when it's not! Also, the car is very attractively designed and has a "New Look", as opposed to looking like a hundred other similar makes & models. Actually the only change from 2003 is a redesigned grill.

My next drippingly gushing comment is in regards to them headlights! The Spectra had excellent low beams and "reach out and touch someone" hi-beams; this car has a different low beam in that they are very bright and diffused close to the vehicle for a band of nice, white light in close. In this car, when you pull the lever the lows actually go out when the Halogen highs come on. These really are "Projector beams" in the truest sense of the word! They shoot a hi-intensity beam way out straight in front in a narrower field than old style sealed-beam headlights. I like to say that they "melt glass at 250 yards!". I drive alot in the dark and they are waaay cool! Believe you me, there's plenty o' light out there!


Looks-wise, by comparison, I saw a new Jaguar (can you say "Jag-You-Are", old chap?) going up the road the other day. It wasn't appreciably bigger than my car and it looked, well, sad compared to my Kia! 
No doubt, the Jag has a cord of wood for trim that my car doesn't, as well as 3 times as many cylinders and a price tag to match...

Frankly, I believe that Kia is where Honda Motors was some years back...we used to say, "Honda? Don't they make mo-peds"? Now look where Honda is in the industry...

So, watch out, Honda! Kia's a'comin'!

So far (1125 miles), the 2.4L motor is still tight so I don't know how the economy will be (24 city to 30 hwy is  advertised). I find that the engine moves the car out quite well. Clearly, it won't have the punch of a V6. I am just enjoying this car so much that I really don't care much about 0 to 60 times...After it's well broken in I'll get into performance, handling at speed, etc.

We plan to drive it to Orlando, Florida (3,500K, round trip) in April, so I'll know alot more by then and will provide an update.

(Also, I will be reviewing Bi-Lateral Total Knee Arthroplasties in about a month, so, stay tuned!)
