            I've owned the Toshiba PDR-M70 for nearly 8 months and am still extremely please with this purchase.  I've taken some amazing pictures with this camera and use it more than any camera I've ever owned.

The camera was not my original first choice.  During my shopping, I focused on the Ricoh RDC-7 and the Olympus C-3000 Zoom.  However, I found both camera's had a few more features than necessary for my needs, and the Olympus especially would immediately require additional accessories.  I discovered the Toshiba on sale for $599  -- less than the lowest Internet price for either of the other cameras (I suspect you can find if for less now).  Upon further investigation (reviews, check of features, etc.), I decided it was the best choice.

Included with the camera were all the necessary cables, a rechargeable battery, an AC charger (for battery and as a power supply to the camera), and a 16 MB Smart Media card.  During my shopping, I had discovered that some companies considered the AC charger a separate accessory.  Having owned an older digital camera already, I knew better!  These things love to eat batteries.

I've read that some people consider the fact that it uses Smart Media as a con.  At the rate technology is changing, I suspect that the storage medium of choice will change a few times before there is really a final standard.  I've not had any problems with Smart Media, and do not believe it to be a negative.  One hint though -- forget the 16 MB cards -- get a couple of the 64 MB cards.

The USB connection is far more convenient than a serial connection.  You basically just plug it in, and your computer treats your Smart Card like another floppy drive.  Plus it's way faster than a serial connection.  It doesn't even require special software.

In regards to the negatives -- they really need to rethink the lens cap.  You have to screw it off to use the camera -- and then keep track of what you did with it.  I've heard various suggestions ranging from Velcro to drilling little holes in it to run a string through it.

In the end, I'm extremely please with this purchase.  The pictures I get are as good as any pictures I've taken with a film camera -- not to mention that digital is far more flexible.
