            We recently purchased a Dodge Ram 2500 V-10 extended cab pick up truck. After driving junkers for years this is a great change. My husband went truck shopping a couple weeks ago. We were looking for a nice truck to give job estimates with because we own our own company. We only had about 11,000 to work with and were expecting to get a chevy or ford. When my husband came home with this truck I was shocked.

This has everything we wanted plus some more great features like: air conditioning, driver and passenger air bags, cruise control,tape deck etc.We also have two boys and needed the extended cab for them. This truck will be great for camping also.

After 22 years of the older style Dodge, this is a great change in the look and style of the body. Some people love the assertive front end;others hate it.We liked the fact that it had a v-10 engine.I wouldn't recommend the v-6 for heavy duty work. There just isn't enough power. We also liked the seatback center in front that folds into an arm rest and opens for storage.The extended cab version arrived in 95 which is our year of our truck.

The performance is great and there's plenty of room.We love this truck! It's big, bad and ready for family fun or work. If your'e considering this truck, you'll be very happy with it.<br><br>
