                I purchased this vehicle in Aug. of 1999. I was very excited at the time. I traveled to several dealers across the state because they were very hard to find. For the price I paid, ~20K, you just can't beat it. Considering other SUV's in it's class ( Kia Sportage, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Geo Tracker, Isuzu VehiCross) this machine has the competition beat in price, inside cargo space, cosmetics, everything in my epinion. There are some drawbacks...

    When shopping for this car, I had just graduated college so I was on a budget. This car was marketed for someone at my age and they, Nissan Marketing, hit the spot. At the time, I was mostly seeing fully loaded Xterra's which can run for 26K. This is the price range for any full sized SUV ( Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, Honda Passport) so unless you truly had your heart set on the Xterra, for that price you could have gotten the larger SUV. So this car is a great bargain but thats because when they advertise the starting price at 17K, thats because it doesn't come with a thing. Namely the roof rack which I believe is what gives it the whole look. I came across one with nothing except the sports package which includes step rail &amp; roof rack. Thats it. No power windows, locks, cruise control, or 4 wheel drive. Yes, it was a mistake not getting 4 Wheel drive becuase I always wanted to do some off roading and yes, I did try to go off roading and I got suck in mud and had to call a towing company. But at the time, I didn't have the money and the salesmen sucked and was just trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of me, so I declined. One other things is the roof rack. It looks great and you can use it but as far as purchasing some type of Thule/Yakima rack system, the standard fixtures do not match with the roof rack diameter so these companies are making things espicially for the Xterra. A pain when you are trying to haul around 4 snowboards.

I took it for a few road trips and it's been great. I got to use thia machine for plenty of snowboarding outings, bikie outings, and skating. They packed in the equipment nicely with room for the crew as well.

All in all, I am very pleased. Everytime I go to hop in the car, I know I made the right choice. 
-Reasonable Price
-Looks Dope
