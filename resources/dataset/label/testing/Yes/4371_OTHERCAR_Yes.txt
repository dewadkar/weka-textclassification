            Updated 21 March 2003 with maintenance.

In December 2000 we were looking for a replacement vehicle, new or used.  The used did not seem so cheap, so we looked at the new line-up.  Web searching lead me to sorrow as none of the cars that we could consider were permitted to tow ANYTHING! Then we realised that NO cars were permitted to tow anymore!  A look at tow permitted vehicles lead to trucks, including SUVs.  We saw some use ones, but a 4WD may be great if you get it new, but repair costs on an abused 4WD would be horrendous with all those driveline parts, then   again how would you find out how nicely a 4WD had been looked after, you often cannot see the damage, especially the expensive stuff.  A work collegue mentioned the Kia, which we then we checked and found that a local dealer had just arrived earlier in the month (just moved from a less noticed location.) Well they ended up being the closest new vehicle dealer of all (although there are many used car dealers are nearby.)

<b>The Saga Starts</b>

I went by myself to check into the dealer and found a pleasant surprise of no pressure and nice shiny new vehicles including the Sportage [up here in Canada we only get the 4WD versions and no convertible or 2WD models].  The shop was not fully up as yet, but they were related to an already established quality dealer a couple of blocks farther, so that was not a concern.  One of my personal pet peeves is that I must be able to sit in any of the seating positions of a vehicle I have, there are some vehicles where I cannot drive as my head is up on the ceiling, this Sportage let me comfortably sit in all positions front seat and rear.  I gathered some facts, pricing, brochures, and then gathered a family meeting. We agreed to test drive a Sportage and then went to the dealer at the appointed time (real cold that day, but bright)for the test drive.  We all fit in (four of the family and the saleman.) Pick-up was a bit less than the old 1991 V6 3.0L Sable wagon, but reasonable for a BRAND new unbroken-in 2.0L 4 cylinder, with 5 people in the vehicle, and unknown fuel type/quality.  The difference in height from ground also contributed to the differing sensation of speed [remember that at a given speed the closer to the ground you are the faster you feel like you are traveling - at the same speedometer speed!, this leads to feeling slower as you get higher up off the ground (in an aircraft the ground does not seem to be moving much at all, but you're travelling much faster than most cars)].

Through my financial networking I got a reasonable idea of the wholesale price these guys had to pay for the Sportage, so I felt pretty good walking in to negotiate the price from which we would be leasing.  The attractive financing rate was another matter that helped [I digress].  In the end we got one that we were very happy to have and got it in our hands just before the new year [2000/2001].

<b>Got It In Our Hands</b>

Going through the owners manual and the brochure had not given us the whole picture of the capabilities of this vehicle and of the full set of features it came with! The brochure made it look good, but it was better in real life!

Our Sportage came with lots of perks that we wanted to have that we had gotten used to in our Sable LS wagon. 

<b>Power accessories: </b>
Power Windows
Power Locks
Power HEATED mirrors - heated was not noted in literature!
Power Steering
Power Brakes 

<b>Safety & Security:</b>
Drivers side dual air bags (steering wheels & knee)
Passenger side single airbag
Power Locks
Four Wheel Drive - on the fly dis/engagement [up to 50mph/80kph]
Rear Window Electric De-Icer [mandatory in Canada]
Rear Window Washer and Wiper
Full-size Spare [ours was not Alloy, but I have seen others with a alloy wheel as a spare]
Tiny tool set hidden in floor of the cargo area
Intermittent Wipers
Air-Conditioning with front windshield defrost, selectable by driver - A/C comes on, but can be turned off
Full-time headlights [mandatory in Canada] - not executed as well as other manufacturers, as all lights, except dash lights are ON --- they do turn OFF with engine running when the hand brake is engaged
4WD High and LOW ranges on the transfer case - plus 4 wheel neutral in Standard Transmission models
Steel Side beams inside the doors
Outside Mirrors fold against the vehicle

<b><i>Comfort:</i></b>
<b>Air Conditioning</b>
<b>Driver Side Lumbar Adjustment</b>
<b>AM/FM/CD</b>, with capability to control a jukebox of CDs remotely using the dash unit
<b>6 Speakers</b> with tweeters in the front window, mid in the front doors, and the Bass in the rear cargo area
<b>Front Seat Arm rest</b> - CD jewel case holding compartment
<b>Courtesy pockets</b> in the front doors - generous in size
<b>Courtesy pockets</b> behind the front seats
<b>Two drink holders</b> for the front seat occupants - a bit awkward above the center air-conditioning vent, I catch it when shifting and cornering if it is open [I guess I should not be doing both of these kinds of activities at the same time](I've read that this has been changed in the newer models.)
<b>One drink holder</b> on the back of the center console for the rear seat occupants and a level spot above it when the Arm rest compartment lid/padded rest is adjusted forward
Tilting <b>front seats</b> - go right down about as flat as a bed, and they also will tilt forward [like in a 2 door] which helps with some cargo
50/50 folding <b>Rear Seats</b> and when both are down, they are further able to be flipped up to give a flat cargo area that extends from the front edge of the rear seats to the tailgate
12 Volt <b>Power Accessory Outlet</b> in the Cargo Area
Carpeting throughout
<b>Tilt Steering Wheel</b> - a little awkward - its a lever under the column
<b>Cruise Control</b> - EX and up, was not available even as an option in the X version
<b>Leather or cloth seats</b> - we chose cloth, as a parcel on the leather will leave a possibly permanent 'dent' in the leather, but not in cloth [also warmer in the winter]
<b>Roof Rack</b> with adjustable bars - and innovative loops built into the bars for tying down the load
<b>Anti-Lock Braking System</b> is available and may be standard on newer models, but we chose to avoid the feature which was available to us

<b>Actual Use Experiences</b>

We have driven in snow, mud, and dirt roads loaded and unloaded during the course of the period of a generous year (27 months as of this writing, March 2003).

We prefer to use the high octane fuel all of the time, it tends to be Shell Gold, so keep this in mind as it may be a factor in our positive experience. We also use synthetic oil, which may also influence the performance.

During the winter we engage the 4 wheel drive far more often and it makes a difference! The capability to use the engine through the 5 speed standard in speed control acceleration and deceleration may have helped a lot too, also in 4WD!  A standard transmission vehicle may also allow for better braking as the wheels are disengaged with the clutch for all wheel stopping on less than optimal surfaces, like ice.

We have been able to run sustained 130-140KPH [80-85 mph] speeds with a full load up and down hills, including a full roof rack and a trailer-like load [a shelf in the 2" hitch receiver] for more than two hours without the Sportage breaking sweat while running the A/C! We were coming back from a camping vacation last summer doing this, believe it!

The cargo capacity surprises everyone who has seen what it could disgorge. We have had the same folks see what our previous Sable carried.  They all said that it seems to have carried more than the Sable wagon!  We just told them that yes it does because in the Sable was all horizontal space and the Sportage is more vertical space.  Up north in cottage country our friends are over a steep hill of looser than comfortable gravel.  The old Sable could not climb that hill loaded without taking run at it.  The Sportage, well, I could stop on the hill and then resume from the point where the Sable got STUCK the previous year, with the same load!  This was with the Sportage in 2WD which still places it in the high range.  I could have crawled up using the 4WD Low range just as well. <i>Just for added info the tire width of both vehicles is the same, with our Sable built on 14" wheels and the Sportage on 15" wheels.</i>

In the whole I would heartily recommend this vehicle to anyone.

Do not expect a luxury car quiet or ride.  This is a truck, make no mistake. The main traditional basis of a luxury car ride was its wide stance and the long wheel base.  This Sportage is not so wide nor is it very long (in relation to luxury cars of yesteryear.) 

The strength of this vehicle is its ladder type frame, yes a true full length frame!

The smaller size of the 2L engine is partially helped by the use of overhead cams and fuel injection.  It will give a whine at speed, but I do not object to it as the sound system can easily overcome the sounds even at low volume settings. 

There has been talk of getting a V6 version up here in Canada, and I know that it has been used in the race version of the Sportage for the 'Paris to Dakkar' and Baja races.  The V6 is in production and installed in the mini-van and the larger Kia SUV.

Our driving is mostly city during the cold months with longer trips during the warm weather.  The fuel consumption was expected to compare with our old Sable according to the government test results.  We have found that the Sportage is much better on fuel, again the fuel and lubrication choices above may affect this matter.

We have now had the first brake work done.  This was a pleasant experience as the parts although only available from the dealer, were less expensive than most alternate sources!

Other than normal fluid changes no other work has been required making the continued experience excellent!!

<b>Trailer Use</b>

The brochure, manual, web site, etc. let us know that a small trailer is permitted.  We chose to have a standard transmission to avoid the problems with the newer shorter lives of our more recent automatic transmissions, which became expensive to repair.  This was not a Kia factor as the automatic transmission has become an expendable part on the North American cars which we have in some sense now abandoned, with sorrow.

We installed a 2 inch trailer hitch receiver, universal type, onto the frame of our Sportage.  The adjustment was made wider than Chevy trucks (which are really skinny for frame spacing), but the spacing was an existing North American truck frame width.  We have pulled our 4' by 6' flat bed trailer (including add-on sides that are up to 4' high) very handily.  The other item we use is a shelf of open grid onto which we load bicycles, peat moss bails, camping stuff, etcetera.  The load capacity of the receiver with the shelf (shelf spec) is 100 lbs. and (vehicle and receiver) is 200 lbs for a drawn trailer.
A 2000 lb maximum is the drawn capacity for the vehicle, which is not too shabby.  Consider that NO passenger vehicle car is supposed to tow anything, just check the websites of the big cars!

The 5 speed Manual Transmission version of Sportage can be placed in tow with all wheels on the ground when the transfer case is set for neutral. This makes all four wheels roll free of the transmission.

Finally, the 4WD Sportage is a Rear Wheel drive SUV when it is in 2WD.  The 2WD Sportage model is different in this respect from the way the owners manual is written.

Great vehicle.  Fits into the new smaller sized parking spaces in malls and elsewhere.  This will fit into most garages as it is less than 6 foot high, as I can look over the top even unloaded.  The spare tire swings away from the curb with the passenger side towards the curb to allow loading and no need to work around the spare tire.

Consider how many SUVs have a LOW range for 4WD, look at what price point you get this feature!  How many can offer the 4 wheel neutral at any price!

Sincerely,
Ilpo
