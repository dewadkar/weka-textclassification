            Focus a very good car at a very good price its fun for the kids and has excellent satndard feature not to mention styling styling in commendable!! Focus did a excellent job replacing the dull cheap looking escort, i think mercury should do the same for the tracer its also cheap Focus is fun to drive fast and quick at stop lights also not top notch quality but commendable quality that should be rewarded!!! Focus remaind a big component to the excellent Honda Civic !!!Focus is cool car !!! the focus remain one of the best economy cars on this palnet with its euro look and its good thought out design much better than what they did with the Escort<br><br>
