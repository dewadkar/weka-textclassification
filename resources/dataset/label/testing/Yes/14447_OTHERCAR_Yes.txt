            Solid.  That's the best word I can use to describe the '96 Camry.  My wife and I bought this car used in 1998 with 33,000 miles on it from CarMax.  The main reason we decided to go with the Camry was it's reputation for being very reliable, and it has not disappointed.  In two and a half years and about 40,000 miles of driving mostly on city streets, the Camry has come to this point without the need for repairs with one exception: the cable that opens the fuel door snapped and needed to be replaced.  Our local service station was able to repair it for about $65.

Our car came equipped with the 4 cylinder engine, a sunroof, leather seating, a wood trim package, and a gold emblem package.  The smaller engine has good pickup off the line, but sometimes feels a bit sluggish when you want to kick it up from 45 to say, 60 in a hurry.  It's also a bit louder than we'd like, but that's something that you get used to after a few minutes.

Inside, the Camry is surprisingly spacious.  The front bucket seats are firm yet comfortable, and the back seat can hold three adults, though the hump in the middle of the floor may cause that third passenger to be a bit cramped for legroom.  The leather seating surfaces show little signs of wear, even after over 70,000 miles.  The overall fit and finish of the car is still very good.  There is one minor rattle that comes from the center console.  We think it's the leather arm rest rubbing against the passenger seat.  Various climate control and radio buttons and switches are all well placed and within easy reach of the driver.  Both systems do an admirable job for an inexpensive family sedan, though I think that the stereo leaves a little too much to be desired.  It has a cheap, tinny sound quality that can't even compete with the factory system that came with my old '88 Chrysler LeBaron Convertible.  The climate control system still pumps out ample amounts of cool and hot air when commanded.

The ride in the Camry is soft, but you're still able to feel the road.  The fact that it's front wheel drive makes for great traction in foul weather.  Handling is neither quick nor precise, but that's not what you buy a Camry for.  

The Camry strives to provide high quality basic transportation, and that's what it does very well.  This is not an exciting car, nor does it turn heads.  But we're happy to own it because we know that we can run it for the next 100,000 miles without having to worry about my wife being left stranded on the road somewhere.  That was our reason for buying it, and that's why we'll seriously consider another one when the time comes.             <br><br>
