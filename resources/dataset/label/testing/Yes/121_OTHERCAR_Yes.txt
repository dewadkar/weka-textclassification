               A few weeks back, I decided to look at and price low-end digital cameras to essentially replace the point-and-shoot 35mm we'd been using.  With a couple of teenagers in the house and all their activities, continually paying for film and developing was making digital photography look cost effective.

   After my usual consumer-oriented research, I homed in on the Fuji Mx-1200 camera as seeming to have the best combination of features &amp; photographic resolution for the buck.

   In the &quot;assets&quot; department, it has as follows:
1.    1280 x 960 resolution, which is about the best I've seen for under at least $300.00;
2.    Removable media (which means you're not stuck with the 4 megabytes of storage that comes with it). I bought a 32 Megabyte SmartMedia card to slide in and it now can hold at least 80 moderate resolution pictures without unloading it (130 or so at the lower &quot;basic&quot; resolution);
3.    It comes with a cable &amp; software to download pictures directly to your computer, &amp; 2 Photo Editing type software programs for the computer;
4.    It has infrared autofocus;
5.    It has 2x electronic zoom (it's not as good as the optical telephoto units that extend in &amp; out from the front of the camera, but they cost a lot more);
6.    It's got a color LCD view screen on the back that you can use to shoot pictures if you want instead of the regular viewfinder (good for us glasses wearers) and to view the pictures you shoot to see if they're OK or if you want another shot;
7.    1.3 million pixels (one of the ways they measure resolution &amp; picture size on these things);
8.    A &quot;macro&quot; setting for really close-ups - and it WORKS;
9.    Built-in flash that can run fully auto or in one of several manual settings;
10.   Numerous viewing options that increases versatility and ease of on-camera editing;
11.   Timed photo shooting and a number of other manual settings that increases your ability to take the shots you really want. 

   In the &quot;liabilities&quot; department, it's design lacks a lens cover or even an option to retrofit one, so you have to guard the lens like a piece of chocolate at a fat-farm if you intend to keep taking clear photos.  Also, you're going to use a lot of batteries if you use the camera's batteries to electronically transfer the photos you take to your computer.  The smart and cost effective thing to do is to buy either an AC adaptor for the camera or a SmartMedia reader/writer to attach to your computer.

   In use, the camera is fantastic.  With little effort, you can learn enough to use it like any &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; camera out there with the advantage of being able to view your handy-work about 4 seconds after you take the picture.  The resolution and color are extraordinary!  If you're willing to spend more time learning how to use all the camera's electronic features &amp; the included software's editing capabilities, you'll be amazed at what you're able to do!  I'm certain there are fancier software packages out there, but it comes with a CD-ROM disk that includes Fuji's own software to download pictures to your computer &amp; edit them and Adobe Photo Deluxe Home Edition photo editing software, both of which do a good job and are easy to use.

   As stated earlier, an AC adaptor is about a necessity.  The Fuji branded product is pretty expensive at retail, but I did an Internet search for &quot;Fuji AC adapter&quot; and came up with one for $19.95 delivered.

   I also got a 32 Megabyte SmartMedia card and a SmartMedia Parallel port reader/writer for way below retail on E-bay and am extremely satisfied with both.

   All said, I'm extremely pleased with this camera and believe it's about the best bang-for-the-buck you're going to find right now.
