            I own a 1996 F150 extended cab and although I like the truck it does have some problems. Some of the problems are that it does not have that much power and it is not the most comfortable ride. Mine also has poor electrical system because when you shut the drivers door the light doesn't always go off and I have had to get it fixed twice. The good things about this is that it does get good gas mileage and it gives you a good view for the road. The other thing is that is also a dependable truck. Mine has almost 160,000 miles on it and other than the electrical the only I had to get fixed was the gas pump but that was still under warranty.
