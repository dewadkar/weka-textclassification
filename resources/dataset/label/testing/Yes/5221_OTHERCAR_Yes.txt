            This DX-10 is my first experience with a digital camera.  I had absolutely no idea what I was looking for and no knowledge of how to use it.   Then one day I was browsing at Mercata.com and found this baby.  It had a decent price on it and at Mercata, they have these things called Power Buys.  Well, it seems that the more people bid or order an item, the price comes down.  Okay, it worked for me, I ordered one.  

I have been selling and buying things at Yahoo and ebay for quite a while.  While things have been selling, it seems nothing sells an item like a photo.  I have had great success with this camera and treasure it!  I feel like it was a great investment.  

It is so very easy to use and upload photos.  My only regret is not doing it sooner.  I can even send in my email.  Its great!  Easy to send photos to family and friends that live far away.  I must say that I have only good things to say about this camera. I recommend you all to look into purchasing some kind of digital camera.  It's a sure shot!

Here are some of the features on this little jewel.  It has high quality capture with 850,000 square pixel CCD sensor, RGB color filter for accurate color and auto flash.  The DX-10 uses a built-in LCD monitor with live video output.  You have immediate image access with high speed serial interface and it uses SmartMedia storage.  You can also purchase a floppy disk adapter or a pc card adapter.  This unit is continuous shooting and has 7 different effects at add to photos.  Very cool!<br><br>
