            Hello Everyone,

I plan on buying a 2000 Integra Type R next month, and from what i heard its a great car. Its fast, sporty, and is the nicest Integra you can get. Its got over 190 horses under the hood, and plenty of power from the get go. I am a person who loves Japanese Compact Sports car and show cars, and i plan on making the Type R into a show winner.

One nice thing about Integra's are that if your into customizing your car, their are 1000's of options for an Integra from body kits, to engine mods, to custom interiors. Its one the top cars at most shows, and their are tons of beautiful integras and i am planning on adding to that number. 

The reason i want the Type R is because you are already have 190+ horses, while the GSR has around 150+ and the LS at SE only have around 140+. That means you already have a strong engine to modigy. Well thats enough for now.<br><br>
