            My wife and I recently switched from a Grand Cherokee Laredo to the smaller 2000 Cherokee Sport. We looked at both vehicles and due to an over-mileage problem on the Grand Cherokee went with the Sport. It has been a pleasant surprise.

The Sport handles better than the Grand Cherokee. It corners and maneuvers like a car. The engine is powerful, almost the same 4.0 liter v6 as the Grand Cherokee, so it is quick and has great pick-up for an SUV. The engine is also one of the Sport's biggest draw-backs. It is LOUD! You certainly feel like you are in a truck with the roar of it's engine. It takes a while to get used to, but once you do it does not detract from overall satisfaction with the vehicle.

While the Laredo goes for some luxuries, the Sport is definitely functional. The back seats are bench style, rather than the bucket seats of the Laredo. Since we don't have kids in car seats, I can't attest personally to this, but I am sure it allows for greater ease in securing a car seat. The cargo area is smaller than the Grand Cherokee, and we were disappointed that the spare tire is still on the side wall of the cargo area, a problem that they have taken care of in the new Grand Cherokee models. The driver and passenger seats are manual and don't adjust as well as they could, but they are comfortable. Whereas the Grand Cherokee has gone for sleak, rounded lines, the Cherokee sticks with the tried and true box, but it is an attractive vehicle, especially in Silver.

Highway driving can be hairy due to the suspension, which apparently was built to withstand off-roading. The ride is shall we say not the smoothest. You tend to feel every slightly large bump, although not so much that it is more than an inconvenience. It is lighter than the Grand Cherokee and more susceptible to black ice, a fact we found out the other night.

As with all SUV's, don't expect gas mileage to have been a concern in designing the Sport. A major criticism of the Sport is the small gas tank....we've gotten to know our local gas station attendants very well(ok, a slight exaggeration).

Since leasing the Sport two months ago, we have had one major problem, although that was caused by contaminated gasoline, and was corrected. Kudos by the way to our dealership, Salerno-Duane in Summit for their courtesy in handling the matter. With no loaners left, our salesman, Bob Cain loaned us his Grand Cherokee for the four days we were without the truck.

Overall, the Cherokee has proven a great value. If you like the classic SUV, and still like to feel you are driving a truck, you will love the Sport. We are very satisfied. Even after four days of driving the new Laredo, we were not disappointed with our choice.
