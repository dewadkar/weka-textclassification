            One day, I was in the market for a new car. In fact, I wanted to buy my first car. So I went to one of those funky warehouses where they claim to have an auction almost every day of the year. I don't know what I wanted exactly, but I didn't want to get stuck with a two-door, five speed rustbomb with megadeth bumper stickers all over it. I almost ended up getting one of those Lincoln Towncars for a good price, but I hated how they handled like a boat. Something at the end of the show area caught my eye. A DMC-12, better known as the DeLorean.

I think we all remember seeing this car in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. It's a really funky car. As a child, I was amazed at the gullwing doors that opened from bottom to top, rather than the normal doors which merely swung outward. But most of all, I marvelled that maybe these cars could truly take you to the future and the past, just like in the movie (keep in mind, I was 8 years old at the time!). I knew I had to have one of these cars. If not now, then at a later date. I managed to get a test drive ... I was surprised to no end. For a car that hasn't been manufactured for over a decade and a half, it ran quite well. The car that I test drove had about 150,000 miles, and ran even better than my '84 Volvo Station, which has about more 30k miles on it. The possibilities are endless for this car. It's flamboyant as hell, and it's sure to attract the right kind of attention.

OK ... so I didn't buy it. If I could have afforded it, I would have bought it, OK? Give me some time ... man, gotta love those doors ...<br><br>
