            I just spent three weeks in a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire as a replacement vehicle while mine was being repaired from an accident.  I was not happy at first with such a small car.  But once I got going in it my opinion changed real fast...this is a cool car!!  It has lot's of pickup for a four cylinder.  It has sporty looks and a well laid out dashboard.  GM deserves credit for putting a radio in a car with a TUNING KNOB not some hard to use button.  The standard stereo was better than the premium one in my Ford Ranger.  The seats were very comfortable and the pedals well spaced.My only complaints were the lack of an ashtray and the lack of power mirrors.  Other than that, you can't get more bang for the buck in any other model.This car deserved serious consideration.<br><br>
