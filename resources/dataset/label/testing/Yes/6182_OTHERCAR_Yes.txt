            My husband and I leased a new, a 1999 Chevy Venture.  We tend to lean towards purchasing Chevy products.  We had previously leased a Lumina, so we were familiar with Chevy mini-vans.  My favorite feature about this van is the battery shut-off.  We have three kids and they are constantly leaving interior lights on or not properly shutting the doors.  Instead of the battery going dead, the van will automatically turn itself off. 
The seats are easy to take out, however a little difficult to replace.  There are plenty of cup holders, although the driver's holders are on the floor and not as easily accessible.  Mileage is good, interior wear is good, it also handles nice. I have been very pleased with this vehicle.<br><br>
