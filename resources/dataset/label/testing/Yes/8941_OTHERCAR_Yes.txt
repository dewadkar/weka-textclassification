            My mother and father recently bought a dodge caravan while i was away from home in college. I was amazed at how smoothly it rides and it ability to handle mountain roads, because i went to school in the mountains. It also is very good on gas mileage, but it takes around $20 to fill the tank completly. It has an awesome radio in it because us teens like to listen to the music loud and it seats all of my friends when we go places. I dont think i would trade that van in for the world.....so roomy, so comfy, a bit dirty.....but other than my house....its my second home.<br><br>
