            I bought this truck for my husband 6 months ago from a friend of mine who was getting a new car, she was originally going to trade it in, but since my husband's vehicle was on its last leg, I asked her to consider selling it to me, and she did, at a price that I consider a steal.

First off, this truck is 11 years old, with over 100,000 miles on it, but it is still in great shape, with the exception of several rust spots, and some body rot, but but considering the age of the vehicle and I live in RI its not too bad!!

Inside is roomy and comfortable, plenty of room to stretch your legs, and plenty of room in between the seats as well, it also has a backseat which folds down for added storage. 

It gives a nice, comfortable ride, very easy to drive, its got power steering and power breaks. Its great on the highway, drives nice at high speeds, and great for around town as well. 

This would be a great work truck, first car for a student, or a great second family car.
