This is a really great car.  Right from the start I am going to brag on how nice this automobile really is.  Just from looking at this car, it has the air of a true luxury automobile, and everyone knows you can depend on the Volvo name.  The halogen lights are bright and effective, and even the hubcaps are attractive.  On the inside, this car is as luxurious as it gets without paying the big bucks.  The leather is very nice, the seats are tremendously comfortable, and there is even enough space in the back to sit comfortably for us big six foot three guys.  The radio/cassette/cd player is nice, and convieniently placed, as well as the rest of the major controls.  The wood finish on the interior is slick, and this car definately ranks up there with the rest of your common luxury cars (BMWs, Lexus, Mercedes).
Also, this car has really nice acceleration.  With a 6 turbo engine, it does not take much to get this car goin.  In fact, you wont even have to rev the engine up at all.  The handling on tihs car is good for a luxury car, but you cannot expect to get the same handling out of this car as any regular sports car.  There are not really any large blind spots, and driving this car is just as nice as it looks
Bottom line - This is a great car, possibly the best out there in the luxury category for $40,000.
