            When I graduated from college, all of my friends were getting new cars, and I was jealous...I wanted one, too.  While the car I had at the time was fine (and a paid for), I decided to let my greed win out over practicality and I decided to go for it.  After seeing the new Miata at an auto show I decided that I had to have it.  So I went out and bought it.  And I am glad that I did...most of the time.

There are so many things that I like about it--the way it handles, the way it looks (I went for the black and tan combo myself), the looks I get when it handles well...  When the weather is just right, nothing beats driving around with the top down.  And because its so small, it cools down very quickly on the days when I prefer the A/C to the "wind in my hair."  The Bose sound system is great, and you can really hear it well even when the top is down.  You can't beat the gas mileage.  And because it is a two-seater, I never have to drive when I go out with my friends (yet they al want to ride in it). I love my car.  I really do.  Really.  Except for when it rains hard.  Oh yeah...snow's not good either.

I have had my car for a year and a half and when it rains really hard the roof has a tendency to leak (thankfully, the leak is on the passenger side).  I have had this fixed twice, and I still continue to have problems with this.  This problem also rears its ugly head when it time to wash the car.  I am lazy, and I love the convenience of being able to drive through a car wash after I fill up the tank.  I can only do this with two handfuls of paper towels and my arms stretched across the car for the duration of the wash.
My Miata does not handle too well in the snow.  Now I know what you must be thinking...it isn't made for the snow.  I know that, but I am not rich enough to have two cars--I am a one car kinda gal. The car is so light, and it has a tendency to slide around.  It's best to drive behind a snow plow if you can.

Even with those problems, I love my car.  I would recommend this car to anyone not living in New England.  And I would even recommend it to those in New England who have a second car to drive.  Happy Driving!
