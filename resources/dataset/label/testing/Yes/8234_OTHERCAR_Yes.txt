            Everyone around me was purchasing digital cameras, and peer pressure forced me to start some research of my own. Well, peer pressure and the fact that I just gave birth to a very un-photogenic child� I was wasting too much 35mm film!

I consider myself a pretty good amateur photographer. I look at background and lighting, try to frame shots well, etc., but I also take pictures almost entirely just for my family and friends. The subject is usually one or both of my kids, but I tend to vacation in picturesque locations, so I wanted a decent (but not too-fancy) all-purpose camera. 

I had a good idea of what features I wanted from what camera-owning friends said they liked or wished they�d waited for. High on my list was a decent zoom. Second priority was size/appearance, and third was megapixel range. Cost was a consideration too, and I set my budget at $300.

Beginning my research, I found a web site that reviewed and rated digital cameras. In its Best Picks area, the Fuji FinePix 2800zoom was picked as the best in the 2-megapixel range. Armed with this advice, I looked further into this model, while still looking seriously at two others. Besides Internet research, I spent a lot of time at Circuit City and Best Buy-type stores holding and testing other brands and models.

I soon found that the Fuji FinePix 2800zoom is like no other in its class. 

I also quickly discovered that while you can set a budget for a camera, once you�ve gotten the necessary accessories, you�ve probably gone way over it. It ain�t just a camera you�re buying, folks, it�s a memory card, AC adapters, a case, tripod, batteries and battery chargers, photo printer, photo paper� (Do you really want me to go on???)

<B>Why I chose it</B>
Yes, it was over my budget by $100. So what really convinced me to get it? The relatively high optical zoom was its biggest pull. At the time I researched it, it was the only camera in the 2-MP range with a zoom that high. I�ve had 35mm cameras with high and low zooms, and whenever I had the cheaper, low zooms I never really got the pictures I wanted. I wanted something really good this time.

Secondly, I have to admit that I gave in to looks on this camera. No, it�s not the first reason I bought it, but I do think it really is adorable. It looks like a big fancy camera in miniature�it�s compact and cute. So many digital cameras look like basic point-and-shoot 35mm, and I wanted something that was smaller and didn�t look cheap.

Megapixels: I originally had my heart set on getting a camera in the 3-MP range, but when I read that the 2-MP are perfectly fine for snapshot-sized prints, I had to think: how often do I enlarge snapshots? Almost never! Yes, once in a while I get a really great one, but it�s so rare that I felt the increase in price to go to a 3-MP camera was not worth it for me. Don�t get me wrong�if cost were not an issue, I most certainly would�ve gotten a 3-MP camera. While there are some 3-MP cameras in the same price range as the Fuji FinePix 2800zoom, they don�t have near the fancy stuff. Basically, I sacrificed megapixels for that to-die-for optical zoom.

The 16MB SmartMedia card. Most digital cameras I researched came with a 8MB card. I figured I could deal with 16MB for general photography (since I�d never be too far from the PC to download), and could wait until I had a vacation scheduled to get a bigger memory card. This was the plan anyway� I immediately ran into a good deal on a 128MB card and bought it. (Anyone want a 16MB card, never used???) By this time my budget was hosed.

Connecting to the PC and viewing photos is fast and easy. Although I edit using something other than the included software (Adobe PhotoDeluxe 4.0), it�s not too bad as far as photo-editing software goes. 

The macro capability is something that didn�t thrill me until I tried it. Now I�m always looking for things I can take close-up shots of, just to use it again. It�s amazing to see the clarity of the close-up shots. This is not something I ever used with another camera, so I don�t know how the feature compares to others, but it�s pretty great on the Fuji FinePix 2800zoom.

Once I�d made my decision, I spent quite a bit of time price comparing on the Internet. Although I found a wide variety of prices, most stores did not have the camera in stock. In desperation I turned to eBay and found a seller who also sold new cameras from its web site, and I placed my order. I paid $349 at normancamera.com ($10 UPS ground). Check out my epinion on Norman Camera�they were great!


<B>Stuff I wish was different</B>
The LCD monitor is really dark in low light when it�s being used as a viewfinder. Although the actual viewfinder is often better, it�s still a bit dark sometimes too. Fortunately the lighting of the pictures usually turns out fine. It�s a bother, but not a huge deal to me, although I know this is a complaint of many users of this camera. 

In low light, there can be a significant delay between the time you press the shutter button and when the picture is actually snapped. I�ve read that this is a common problem for many digital cameras and that it�ll be improved in upcoming models. My best advice is to try to anticipate the shot and press the shutter button just a bit before you normally would.

Battery power is sucked down pretty quickly when using standard AA batteries. I�ve found they last longer if I use the Ultra High Power Mega Wattage Super-Duper Titanium Extra Juice variety. I have not yet tried rechargeables to see if they�re any longer lasting. An AC power adapter is highly recommended, especially when downloading to the PC. Of course, this also increases the price of the camera even further.

I thought the continuous shooting thing was cool, and when my sister asked me to take some pictures of her friends I tried it out. I set it to continuous shooting, told them to say �cheeeeese!� and held my finger down on the shutter button. Much to my disappointment, almost all of the shots came out blurry. Now, I don�t for one minute blame this on the camera; I�m sure my unsteady hand was the cause. I just think that now I need yet another piece of equipment�a tripod�to use that feature to get some good quality continuous shots. <I>~sigh~</I>

I need a case for this thing, and although I haven�t looked at a <B>bunch</B> of places yet, I�ve not yet found one it will fit into well. This is a squatty, fat, small-but-bulky camera, and a standard camera bag just won�t do. Be warned.


<B>Summary</B>
Although I�ve used a few digital cameras, this is the first one I�ve owned, and overall I�ve been absolutely thrilled with it. It does all I wanted it to do, and more. I no longer waste film when snapping pictures of the kids, and love that I don�t have to wait to develop and print them to see if they turned out. Ah, but the <B>real</B> test will be when I take it on vacation next month!

I�ve seen the price go a bit lower since I purchased my Fuji FinePix 2800zoom, so more than ever, I highly recommend this camera�it�s a great value for the $$!
