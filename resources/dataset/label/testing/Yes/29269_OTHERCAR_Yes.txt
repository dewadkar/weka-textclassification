            I have had my Envoy XL SLE for about 3 months now. At first I was a little hesitant because I have only owned Fords.
<b> I am now converted to GMC.</b> <p>
I will make this review fairly undetailed because driving is believing, but let me help you ease your fears. Although it weighs in at 6,200 pounds, the 275 horsepower engine gives it more than enough torque to get you up to 60 m.p.h. in a reasonable time. It is actually faster than the Explorer I traded in. And it weighs 2,000 pounds more than that Explorer! I have also seen gas mileage of about 17 m.p.g., so they sticker on the window was correct. My Explorer was a bigger gas hog than this machine and it had 65 less horse power. Passing is a breeze as well. On a recent road trip, the only problem I had while passing people was getting cars to let me squeeze in between them. I would pass cars that were doing 65 m.p.h. like they were standing still. The acceleration from 60-100 is very nice for a vehicle of this size.<p>
The interior is very roomy, and easy to get used to. I opted not to go with the SLT version because I live in Alaska and leather feels horrible when it's cold. The stock 6 speaker stereo (not the Bose, the GMC stereo) is very easy to use while driving and is quite loud and very clear. The only thing it doesn't have is the ability to decode MP3's on the fly. I am an avid car stereo enthusiast, and have opted not to change the stereo in the vehicle because it is all around very nice.
7 full sized adults can ride for hours and hours very comfortably and that makes this vehicle a dream for road trips. The ability for the center seats to recline makes it just that much better. The rear air extends all the way back to the third row so the passengers in the far back never get too cold or too hot. The only con to this vehicle is the heater controls. While everyone else has digital controls, or at least buttons, the Envoy still has sliders for heat temp (although it is dual climate, very nice) and rotary knobs. They are very functional, they just look out of place in such a marvelous vehicle. If I had to do it all over again, I would by this same vehicle. I am considering getting a 2004, if the wife lets me that is.<p>
I ended up paying about $39,000 in total but I got the extended warranty, all of the paint guard and cloth guards, and I also took a $2,000 negative equity for my trade in of the Explorer.
