            Let me count the ways. . .


 Oh, Honda Civic, you are so dependable
1. You SIP gas....about 26 miles per gallon and that's just city driving!!

2. Your ride is SO smooth...with all of those damn potholes in Massachusetts, you are still a pleasure to drive.
 
3. You have anti-lock brakes

4. I have yet to find a blind spot...or at least one that's really bad.

5. You LOOK GOOD!!

6. Your seats are comfortable.

7. You have a GREAT turning radius

8. Your ride is fairly quiet

9.  You have a roomy backseat 

10. And a large trunk ... and the rear seats fold down which makes moving MUCH easier.

11. You have power doors and windows  . . .cruise control, ABS, cd player, sun roof. . .  (though these are not all standard)

12. You hold your value better than almost any other car (besides  the accord)

13. You are more affordable than other cars with the same features

14. I know I will enjoy you for years to come

Honda's have a great track record and the civic is a wonderful car. It has so much to  offer.  I can't write a review full of jargon  but I can assure you that the Honda Civic is a dependable car that feels great to drive. And the new models really have a great look to them. This car is especially great for younger people ...college students and those just starting out. It is more affordable than many other cars and most importantly, Hondas hold their value! So this car is a great investment.  I LOVE MY HONDA CIVIC
