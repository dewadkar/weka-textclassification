            i did quite a lot of research before buying this camera (may 2000).  for me, it came down to the kodak 4800, canon a20, and canon s10.  i picked the a20 after considering picture quality, its newer technology, its compact size, its 3x zoom, and the fact that it takes relatively inexpensive AA batteries.  in hindsight, i think for my purposes, i definitely chose the best camera (it is also the simplest to use out of the three).

i have had the camera for about two weeks now, and i've taken about 300 pictures with it.  i am still very, very impressed with the picture quality.  with virtually no tinkering i'm able to take amazing pictures the first time around.  the camera works brilliantly in auto mode.  in manual mode, you can change the exposure, white balance, focal length, and flash mode to get more precise images.  all around, i cannot complain at all about the camera's picture quality, its build, or its features.  incidentally, the camera has a photostitch mode which allows you to take pictures in succesion and then merge them to create a panoramic shot.  i am shocked! how perfectly the camera is able to merge the pictures together seamlessly!  its definitely been the most positively surprising feature i've encountered with the camera.

there is one thing that detracts from this camera's perfection though, its battery life with regular alkaline batteries.  one of the main reasons i bought this camera was because it was suppose to have a very long battery life especially when compared to most other digital cameras on the market, but i've only been able to manage 60 or so (large, superfine) shots with regular alkaline batteries before having to change them.  the manual, and many reviews say that you should be able to get at least 200-500 shots with alkaline, and 350-1000 shots with NiMH batteries, but i haven't seen that with my camera yet.  i must admit that i have not tried ultra alkaline or NiMH batteries yet, and i do tend to do a lot of reviewing of my pictures with sucks up a bit of battery power.

overall, i am extremely pleased with this camera.  its everything i could have asked for (except for an unresolved battery issue).  i'd strongly recommend it for anyone (non-super photographers excluded) who is just looking for a compact digital camera that takes great pictures without hassle (and potentially may even have a long battery life).
