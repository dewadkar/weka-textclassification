            This Truck is awesome. Not quite a powerhouse , but surely enough to get you through those outdoor adventures,or just on the streets. I love my Toyota ! There is just enough room in the extended cab to add sub's and other accessories that make the experience more appealing. My 5 speed is an exciting addition to my pride and joy, (be careful because of its high center of gravity though, ESPECIALLY with large tires ). If you would like to improve engine performance, there is an abundance of parts and accessories to add a few horses. Like I said, this is not a Mustang, just a stud ! Nitrous oxide is available, exhaust kits, K&amp;N filters,and more. I would seriously recommend this truck to ANYONE with a desire for off road , or little duties that a truck is needed for. Have fun with your TOY and enjoy the GREAT gas mileage !!!
