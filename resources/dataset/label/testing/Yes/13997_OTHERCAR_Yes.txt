            After driving my 1999 Isuzu Rodeo for three years, and having constant break downs and things falling off of it, I was really welcoming my parents Honda.  They bought it new in 95, fully loaded and runs like a dream.
The ride is smooth and it's even fun to drive. It's also got some pick up for a smaller car..........zooms right out into traffic, and believe me, living in Massachusetts you have to be quick on the pedal!  As you know we all drive like mad men......or so most people think. Damn Boston drivers:)
After 7 years it is still in perfect condition.  No rust, no problems what so ever, not even a ding from the occasional run away shopping cart.  The sun roof is huge, letting a nice breeze in during the hot summer months.  The leather seats still look new and I don't even think they were ever conditioned. Granted the car has been taken care of very well, but I have to say that for a car with a few years, and a lot of miles on it, it still runs like new.
