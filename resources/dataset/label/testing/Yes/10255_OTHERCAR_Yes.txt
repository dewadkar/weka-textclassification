            I have just purchased at 2003 Lincoln LS. Since my finances are limited I opted for the Premium V-6. The engine is a 232HP V-6. It actually gets a full 10 miles per gallon freeway more than its V-8 cousin. With the premium package I was upgraded to the audiophile 12 speaker, 6 CD in dash and two Subwoofer stereo system which really rocks. I have never heard bass that deep without any distortion. I also got heated and cooled front seats wich work amazingly well, they blow the air through perforated leather with a small fan. They're are 3 temp settings for the seats. Another upgrade was the Stabilitrac suspension and steering which is supposed to help you out of a skid or slide. I got the cargo net for the trunk as well as rear sonar detection device that beeps in different frequencies when u back up to detect objects behind you. With the premium I also go the Moonroof which was very nice. Basically I am missing the GPS and on board computer as well as the THX sound system. That was almost another 4 grand.

The car drives like a dream. Its very nimble and powerful as well. Very low road noise but the engine noise does grumble a bit in city driving. The seat is extremely comfortable and leather is very soft as well. The controls are all well placed and I have no complaints about the interior or exterior design. The trunk is spacious. Inside the car there are lots of little compartments for CD, change, sunglasses and cell phones in the car. Glove compartment is a little small. Rear seating is a little tight but incredibly comfortable nonetheless. This car looks classy and drives incredibly well for an American car. I am impressed.

When I saw this car on the dealers lot, I never test drove it. I bought it blindly but I was very pleased to find out that I made a great decision. If you have looked at a BMW 3 series or perhaps the Cadillac CTS, Infinity G35 or Audi A6 and have not been impressed. Go take a look at the Lincoln LS. You may be surprised.
