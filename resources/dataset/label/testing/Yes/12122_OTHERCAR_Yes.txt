            I can't say enough good things about a Mazda.  I have owned three of them.  The first was a 1986 Mazda 626.  This was a GREAT family car because it was roomy and very, very comfortable.  In addition to being  suitable for Sunday rides, it was used for long trips several times and operated beautifully. It was dependable until the day we traded it in.  Not only was the 626 a dream to drive and ride in, it was also an attractive automobile.  The price was affordable, somewhere in the $10,000.00 range.  We serviced the car every 3000 miles and had NO problems with it.

The next Mazda was a 1987 323.  I purchased this vehicle new for around $7,000.00.  I still have this car.  Thirteen years old, it still has the same engine, the same clutch and the same transmission.  It has been a wonderful all around car.  For thirteen years, it was driven to and from work in stop and go traffic anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes twice a day.  There has never been a problem.  I have never been stranded and it has just racked up 175,000 miles.  Since it is a hatchback, I can use it to haul things and it has been camping several times.  

The other Mazda was a B2000 pickup.  It was suitable for our needs at the time and was a great vehicle to teach the kids to drive with a stick shift.

Bottom line is I LOVE the Mazda.  They have all been reliable transportation and vacation vehicles.  I definitely will get another Mazda when I am ready for another car.  I plan on purchasing another 626 or perhaps a Protege as they both appear to have good track records and being a recent retiree, I plan to travel extensively.  However, my 323 still has a lot of life left in her.  Did I mention the gas mileage.  It's about 40 miles to the gallon on the freeway and around 25 to 30 in the stop and go traffic.

Just in case I didn't get my point across,  I LOVE MAZDA's.<br><br>
