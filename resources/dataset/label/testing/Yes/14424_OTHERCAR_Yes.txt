            Bought my '97 Club Cab Sport new on a lease in February 1997.  It's a super truck and I recommend it to anybody, however, I hate being on a lease - it limits the miles I can drive.

Before I describe the positives, let me cover the negatives: The paint on the front bumper cracked and peeled at the end of the warranty period.  The space in the back seat needs another 6 inches of leg room.  I'm 6'2&quot; and my boys are 5' 10&quot; already.  It's too tight.  In my opinion, it's time for Dodge to design a new grill/front end.  This one was cool when first introduced, but now is boring.  The lines of the truck kind of stick-out a bit and therefore I've gotten a lot of small chips on the paint from things flying off the road.  Front seats should recline further.  Goes out of alignment annually, but that may be because a road to my house needs paving desperately.  When I bought it they didn't offer the CD/tape/radio option, which would be my preference.

The positives are the important things.  Great size.  Not too small and not too big.  Just right - Goldilocks would love this truck.  Great ride.  Very reliable.  Everything's easy to reach.  Good storage under back seat.  I recommend everyone to buy a Club Cab to keep stuff dry in the rain/snow and safe when parked.  I drive it short and long distance and it's great.<br><br>
