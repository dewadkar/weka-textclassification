            I had a 96 Ford Explorer with all of the toys.  I really enjoyed this vehicle.  However, it does have its faults.  It's towing capability isn't good. the in-line 6 doesn't have enough power.  I know your saying why didn't you get the V8.  I'll tell you.  To get an Explorer with a V8 I lose the option of 2WD.  If Ford would have not went to AWD with the V8 I would have gotten it.  

It's offroad capabilty it's great either.  Low ground clearance and poor shocks are 2 faults.

So If your looking for a sport utility to drive like a car and get car like gas mileage get an Explorer.  If you want a SUV to kick some butt, I'd look at a Durango. I have a Durango now.<br><br>
