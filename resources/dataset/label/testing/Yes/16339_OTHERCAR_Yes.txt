            I received this camera as a birthday gift this past September and I've had the best of luck with it so far!

I didn't pick out the camera myself, but if given the chance, I would definetely choose this camera over several of the others available, mostly because of price and options.

This camera is very simple to use and the software that comes with it is fast and easy to install onto your computer.

One drawback to this and most other digital cameras is that they tend to drain batteries, I'd definetely consider investing in the rechargeable type, it'll save you money in the long run.

This camera is fairly compact, it measures about 3x4" and is about 1 1/2 inches thick. It has a small screen on the back to preview your pictures with, and if you don't like the way they came out you can simply delete and retake the picture. Thats a great feature for me, since I'm fairly picky about the pictures I take.

downloading the pictures to the computer is simple and easy, you just plug the camera in and follow the onscreen instructions, once you've put the pictures on the computer, you can email them to friends, edit them and make cards or other things out of them. It takes a little getting used to, but once you get into it, you'l find it fun and easy.

The camera takes 4 AA batteries, and comes with one memory card, which you can use to take 35 low grade prints, 10 medium and 5 high resolution. The pictures come out beautiful, and you'd never know they were taken on a digital camera, I printed one I'd taken of a sunset and no one even realized it was digital.

I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for a nice digital camera whos on a budget. This is a great camera for a beginner and the price is reasonable.
