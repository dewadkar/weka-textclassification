            I was fortunate enough to be able to test this camera before I actually bought it. The single most important and desirable feature of this camera is that is stores the images on floppy disk. This means no download images to your computer, no running out of storage space while away from home. The camera has all the bells and whistles you would want.  The ability to create MPEGS, ability to do voice memos, as well as the ability to be creative in your picture taking.  There are picture effects for sepia tone pictures, reverse negative, solarize and black and white.  The best use of this camera for my family was at Christmas.  I was able to take an MPEG of our whole family at the Christmas dinner table and send it to my sister in Alaska who wasn't able to be with us. She had a moving picture with sound!  The FD-81 is hard to find now. The only difference between the FD-81 and FD-83 is body color.  If you want to buy a quality fun camera, I highly recommend the FD-81. You can spend less on a camera, but remember, you get what you pay for.
