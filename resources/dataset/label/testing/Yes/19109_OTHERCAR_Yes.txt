            After test driving the monte carlo, I was a little unimpressed.  I am looking to buy the Pontiac Grand Prix, its sister car.  please read under pontiac my review &quot;American Power&quot; and you will see why pontiac is the better car.  The Monte Carlo has the standard 200 HP series II v6  and is unchanged from the 2000 model year as far as design and interior styling.  I think the front has a good look to it but the rear I beg to differ.  It rode quiet and handled nimbly.  Steering was precise and it had a flashy dash for a Chevy.  The car I test drove had cloth seats, pwr locks, win, mirrors, dual climate control but it was analog.  The controls were on sliders.  I could not set the digital temp like in the Grand Prix or the thermometer in the house.  The rest was there as well.  Abs, lighted visors, rear window defog, ac, tilt, cruise...  The car had strong pickup with no torque steer (the feel of the steering wheel being pulled to one direction from the force of the acceleration.  It was Black on a tan colored interior.  I thought it looked very nice.  With an estimated 20 city and 30 highway it seems to have great gas mileage for its power and performance.  The braking is much better than the 95 version.  I still miss my 84 monte carlo with its 305  v8.  Not only that I think the older monte carlo had a much much nicer body styling.  This car is a little far fetched.  It looks great up until the tail.  It was a much heavier and more comfortable vehicle. Then again there is no comparison between older and newer cars.  
But for what its worth, it did not seem like a bad car.  I like the SS because it looks more  muscular from the rear with the dual pipes and the sportier package although it does not offer the supercharged engine.  The radio was very busy.  It had many features such as a weather band and displayed the type of music setting you were using such as Pop or Rock...  It had great sound to it for a stalk radio. The only thing this car offers over the grand prix is the fact that in the leather version both the driver and passenger side seats are heated and powered.  Everything is on the steering wheel also from cruise to radio controls.  Pass through center of rear seats along with the split fold to add extra storage space when needed is available.  The car has great lighting from the reading lamps on the rearview mirror to the center light on ceiling.  It has a computer control console on the ceiling displaying the temp and compass functions.  The onstar system is also available. Driver side airbag is there in the event of a side impact but not one for the passenger.
