            IU think that the explorer should atleast have the 90% mark on this chart not the 87% that like a B+ and i personally would give it a A- its one of the smartest !!I purchased my Explorer on Jan.5 99 i have had it a year already and i have to say its excellent it rides like a baby and i love that. i truly would recomended this car to anyone who wants something that will last practically forever and very dependable on the road.i enjoy my 4x4 espicailly when i got exactly what i want for only 27,125.00 for it !!. GET one today youll love it !!! you will be very safe in it in all the crash test ive read 2 companies said it was a &quot;excellent&quot; and 3 said&quot;good&quot; and 1 said acceptable and other than that NO poors or marginal thats great!! i want something that is safe and well assembled!! very carefully put together!!GET ONE TODAY!!!<br><br>
