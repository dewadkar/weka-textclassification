            It�s the classic problem, you want a nice car but you don�t have a pile of money.  What do you do?  Answer: Go see your local Hyundai dealer and ask him about the 2002 Sonata.

After visiting the major line dealerships in this medium sized Northern Wisconsin town and seeing the high prices and low levels equipment, in frustration, we went to the Hyundai dealer.

After being greeted by a staff that was friendly and seemed interested in our business and our needs, our sales representative presented several Hyundai models.  Maybe his knowledge of his product came from having to orient customers to the Hyundai Company and it�s lines in this traditionally �American Made� town or maybe it came from just having good sales technique, but it was refreshing to have a sales person that knew something about his product.

The model we chose was the 2002 Hyundai Sonata.  

Exterior

The Sonata exterior is fluid and well styled with the front being reminiscent of the �C� class Mercedes and the rear similar to the Jaguar.  Color selection is varied although the colors tend to be more elegant than sporty which is appropriate to the vehicles overall personality.  Paint quality is good with no noted overspray, ripples, runs or �orange peel�.  Fit and finish  is good with straight seams and even lines and window gaskets fit well with no exposed adhesive.  The doors have a solid feel and close with a sound of weight and quality.

Trunk

The trunk has over 14 cubic feet of cargo space and comes standard with a cargo net.  The trunk lid opens with a remote release from the passenger compartment or with the key and the lid is a �low lift over�.  The fit and finish of the material lining the trunk is of good workmanship but it does not offer much in the way of padding.  The back seats do fold down and lock to allow longer parcels to be carried in the vehicle.

Engine Compartment

I will admit that I am not much of a mechanic but the engine we selected was the 2.4 liter, 4 cylinder engine.  It runs smoothly and quietly.  The engine does have multi-point fuel injection which is very important in our part of the world where winter mornings can easily reach minus 25 and a car is measured by how easily it starts.  Service points are marked in yellow and right out front.  It doesn�t get much simpler than that.

Passenger Compartment

The  passenger compartment is a pleasant surprise in the Sonata.  The driver seat is fully adjustable so a small woman or a large man are both comfortable driving this vehicle.  Although the adjustment controls are manual, they are easy to use and effective.  Both front seats are well padded and should provide excellent comfort even on longer trips.  Controls are logically placed in  the vehicle and easy and straightforward to use.  The cruise control is located on the steering wheel and the tilt wheel adjusts with a light touch.  Power window and door lock controls are located on each door and the drivers door has controls for all windows.  The drivers window also has an auto down switch to allow for express opening of the drivers window.  Quite handy in a situation such as  paying tolls at a toll booth.  With the flip of one door lock, all the doors lock.  The vehicle may also be unlocked with the remote alarm button kept on the keyring.  The AM/FM radio with a CD player  is located in a convenient location and the controls are well marked and large enough to not become a problem.  Sound quality is good from the six speakers.  Heating and air conditioning controls, although not automatic, are clearly marked and easy to use.  Dual front airbags are standard as well as side impact airbags in the front.  The passenger front airbag has a weight sensor to detect small passengers.  The back seat has enough room for average size adults to ride comfortably although the back seat is not padded as well as the front seats.  The fit and finish of the upholstery is good but don�t expect the carpets and fabric, although of good basic quality, to be up to the standards of a luxury car. 

Summary

OK folks, the Hyundai Sonata is not a Toyota Camry, but it�s pretty close considering the Sonata is at least $5,000 less.  It�s comfortable to drive, has good handling characteristics, adequate power (even with the 4-cylinder engine)  and the styling is great.  Combine that with the bumper to bumper warranty of 5 years / 60,000 miles and an engine and power train warranty of 10 years / 100,000 miles, this car really packs a lot of bang for the buck. (Ford and GM, are you listening?)  The only major downside of the Hyundai Sonata that I can see is the trade-in value if you trade cars every 2 years or less.  If you keep this car more than 4 years you will definitely come out the winner.
