            This is an excellent SUV.  The inside is comfortable and roomy, and feels like a car.  The sound system is nice (although not much bass).  It's generally a smooth ride, although sometimes it can get rather bumpy.  I like the car a lot, but as much as people say that SUV's aren't trucks, I think that they are.  It's a heavy car, so it accelerates just like a truck.  You've got to hit the brakes much earlier, again because of the weight.  I think the steering wheel is a little bit small, which isn't such a bad thing, although at some times it annoys me.  Other than that, it's a great car.  I definitely recommend it to anybody who wants a great vehicle to get them up to the mountains.<br><br>
