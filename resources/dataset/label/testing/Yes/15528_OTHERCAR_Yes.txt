            We bought our JX on line through AutoNation and a local dealership in JX, Florida.  The transaction went very well in all regards.  I selected the green/tan JX and opted for custom wheels.  The total cost of the car, including outrageous delivery &quot;fees&quot; to benefit no one but the dealership was $23,100.  AutoNations price alone was a fantastic $21,500 for this model new in July, 1999.

The car is great fun to drive, it is sporty both in and outside, and its V-6 is more than adequate.  Standard equipment covers everything from power seats, windows, top and so forth to an excellent sound system.  The car design is extremely attractive, and engineering is solid.  It is amazingly quiet for a rag top.  While this car could easily be a year round everyday vehicle, it is a &quot;toy&quot; for us and has only 700 miles on it, so I can't comment on repairs or reliability.  The one thing I have noticed is perhaps less than perfect paint (a problem with many Chrysler products, including our Dodge Caravan).
