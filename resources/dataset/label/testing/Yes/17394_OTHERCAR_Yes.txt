            I must first be honest; this car is out of my price range.  My mother recently purchased this Volvo S60 but I have driven S60's extensively, especially hers when I am home from college.  
Why is it that the young can never afford such fun cars anyway? 
I assume one major draw to this vehicle is its sportiness.  One must not go for the exotic, a Porsche for example, to have fun enjoying the American pastime of driving.  It is all available in the Volvo.  
With the turbo or low pressure turbo, the driver can maintain a conservative image while secretly possessing a power engine with fast acceleration.  
But most importantly is regarding the Volvo image itself.  It may state that you are from New England, possibly Connecticut.  If the Volvo is a wagon you may have a golden retriever.  You definitely ski and sail and spend summers somewhere.   Volvo does not leave this image behind with the S60.
It is certainly far more upscale, however, than the 240 wagon and sedan that my brother and I have respectively.  

For one thing, there are curves.  240s do not have these.
For another, there is the acceleration that was previously mentioned.  The original Volvo's lacked that feature entirely.  
In the S60 the leather seats are wonderful, the wheel and seats adjust to the exact setting that makes you most comfortable, and the sunroof is a must. 
The S60 is not as large as the similar looking flagship, the S80.  But this smaller size give it an edge as far as handling.  There is a tighter feel to the S60.
Compared to the S40, the S60 is far faster and more comfortable, although perhaps not as nimble.

So, if you are willing to spend in the mid $30k's for a car, I would suggest looking to the Swedes for design and comfort, and also a car that looks a bit more unique than all the others at this price level.
