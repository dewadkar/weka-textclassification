            I have had my truck almost a year now and feel I can write a knowledgeable review of it. I find it interesting that many of the reviews I have read are from people not owning the truck, which is pretty annoying! Driving your great aunts or your second cousins girlfriend truck to the quick-e-mart is not enough experience to write the review, but now I'm annoying myself!


The truck I have is the Eddie Bauer version. I researched this truck for months before buying. My research consisted of Consumer Reports, talking to my mechanic, epinions, talking to other expedition owners, and talking to many new and used car salesman. This SUV (or truck as I call it) meets up to all my expectations and then some.


There are many features on the vehicle that I like. Here are just a few: the auto moon roof, the temperature and MPG display, the auto seats, lumbar support, heated seat, air suspension system (which lowers the vehicle when you park), stereo system, the auto lock option, adjustable pedals (great for different drivers sharing a vehicle), leather seats and so much more. Okay, so that was more than a few.


I have not had any problems mechanically (or otherwise), so I have only went to the shop for routine maintenance. I have went on many trips across country and the Expedition has been great. I guess the only complaint I might have is the gas mileage, but I knew what I was in for, isn't there a saying "don't buy the pony if you cant afford the oats," I don't know the saying, but that's how it goes with SUVs. The mileage I get is anywhere from 13-18 mpg, it varies as to what I'm doing.


When I first started driving this SUV I was a little nervous about the large size, but it did not take me long at all to get used to it. I now hate driving my husbands 4 door car. I have taken this expedition off road and on snowy roads and it has been great. One last thing should mention is that there is seating for eight, but the last 3 back seats would not be comfortable for adults.


All in all I would recommend this SUV!


Thanks for reading!

JUST A UPDATE-  9-29-02
The vehicle is still great! I have had it in the shop 3 times for things that were not routine maitenance. Once was for a set of new tires, the tires were a recalled item (firestone) and it was pretty cool getting nice new tires at no cost. The next time was for the back wiper. It stopped working, this was easily fixed and still under warranty, so no charges. Finally the last time was for brakes.

I still recommend this vehicle.

Yet another update: 9/12/03
Still have the vehicle and it is still running smooth with no problems.
