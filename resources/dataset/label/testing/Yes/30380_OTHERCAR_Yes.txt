            First off let me say I never intended to buy an AZTEK. I never even heard of it until the day before I bought one. I was ready to replace my reliable yet not so exciting 1998 Chevrolet Venture minivan. I have 3 kids so I need something with space for all the crap I wind up hauling around on a daily basis. I was tired of the minivan scene after 6 years of it. 

I searched for weeks for my perfect vehicle. I was looking at other SUV's (too expensive and not nearly as functional as the AZTEK) I test drove so many cars that I was becoming ill at the thought of doing it over and over again..

One day my father and I happened upon a Pontiac Buick GMC showroom. He insisted I look at the Buick Century...I drove one. It rode nice but in a word BLAH!! Across the showroom floor , dad and I spied this red thing with a tent and air mattress in the back of it. What the heck is that? It was an AZTEK! Well my dad said THIS IS IT! This is beautiful...Beautiful I thought? Bizarre is more the word I thought. Nevertheless, I climbed in it and checked it all out and thought, hey this is really pretty RAD! I like it, I like it i thought...I drove it, then I thought....sold!! 

The true test was my husband...I ran home to tell him of my great find, brochure in hand. He looked somewhat puzzled and said no way! I explained he must come to the dealer and drive it...He agreed with hesitation.

We packed the 3 kids in the back and took off on our test drive. Here is where the Aztek shines. A really pack a punch 185 horse power V6 engine. This car has some power and handles superb on the road. Turns are no problem and you could not ask for a more smooth, comfortable ride. The interior is spacious enough to seat my 3 kids comfortably and I like the fact that the middle passenger has a shoulder belt, not just a lap belt. I have never seen this feature before. The dash is probably one of the most fun features. At night its lit up in all red and makes you feel like you are in some sort of space capsule ready for blast off. All the controls are within easy reach. The rear and front seats recline and there is ample legroom to make the AZTEK ride one of the most comfortable of all the cars I have ever been in.

The Aztek has an incredible 10 pioneer speaker sound system. I never heard such primo sound in any vehicle. This only adds to the enjoyment as you trek up and down the highway jamming to your favorite tunes...

The camping package with its tent and air mattress make it incredibly functional and unique. (There are other packages available also) The air mattress is quite comfortable, and I cant wait to take a camping trip. While others are sleeping on the ground, I will be catching some serious zzzzzzzzzz's in comfort. The rear radio controls are also a plus and great for tailgating. There is plenty of rear cargo space and an optional cargo tray that can be purchased to hold this and that. Also a removable consule cooler/cd holder is something that brings versatility to this vehicle.

All in all I am delighted at the choice I made and would not hesitate to tell others..GO GET ONE...It is an absolute blast to drive and anyone not giving this car a chance is really missing out on something new and different..see ya on the road!

UPDATE

I just wanted to give an update since I have been driving this vehicle for almost a year now...I just want to let other potential owners out there know that my opinion on this vehicle has not changed even in the slightest. I have not had one single issue or problem with this car since the day I drove it off the dealer lot. It has performed to my high expectations and as I have been seeing more and more of these on the road, I no longer seem to get those puzzling looks from others. People seem to have accepted the odd looking Aztek..or so it seems to me. I was recently stopped in the mall parking lot by a couple people inquiring as to the performance/functionality of the vehicle and after I gave them my honest opinion, they responded with a "I have got to get one"..Absolutely!! go and get one!! Its an awesome car, and I love it as much today as I did a year ago.
