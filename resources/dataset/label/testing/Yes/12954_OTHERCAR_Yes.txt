            I bought my 1997 Chevy Malibu in Feb. of 1998. It was a program car that had only 3000 miles on it. We shopped around for several different kinds of vehicles. Namely Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord. One thing that put the Honda Accord down on my list was that is seemed to have an excessive amount of road noise and bad shock control (ie. jumped and bounced around when going over bumps, holes, etc). I really loved the Camry. The bad thing about it was only the inflated price, otherwise I'd have probably bought it. I went to test drive the Malibu, thinking how cheesy Chevy's would be after driving Toyota's. Much to my surprise, I found it fun, cute, comfortable, and very powerful for the 4 cyl. engine. It is actually a lot more pep and power than our other car that is a V6. My husband thinks the down side of this model is not having a power seat adjustment. This is one of the only extras that our model doesn't have. It even has a cassette and CD. It is not an LS. We have talked my mother-in-law into getting one when her lease is up in November 1999. The only reason she'll consider it is that it now comes with optional leather seats--which seems to be a must for her (even though she lives in Florida).  The seats were also a big draw to this car for me. I have a back problem that starts to kill me on a road trip if I'm not comfortable. I've never had this problem in my Malibu. Also, for us shorter people (you know who you are--and if you are--why this matters), the seat-even when pulled all the way forward-allows you plenty of room away from the steering wheel. This (hopefully) will keep you from being to injured if you were in a minor or major accident when the air bag inflates. Also, for the other side of the spectrum, my husband is 6'2&quot; and has a hard time getting his long legs in cars. The Malibu allows him to easily and comfortably fit in the seat without bumping his knees on the dash when the seat is pushed back.  Overall, I'd rate it an &quot;A&quot;. And an &quot;A+&quot; in fun, cuteness, and comfort. <br><br>
