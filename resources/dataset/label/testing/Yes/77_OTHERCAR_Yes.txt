             In December 1996, I purchased an 1988 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback. At the time I was an E-3 in the U.S. Army and my pay didn't allow for me to buy an more expensive vehicle. I have to say for this car being 12 years old it has withheld the test of time. 

 In the 2 years I have owned, other than regular maintenance, I have 2 problems with the car. One was an oil leak, which cost me around 200.00 dollars to get fixed. The other was my clutch went out. Luckily I worked with an mechanic and he offered to help me change it. That cost me about 200.00 parts and labor, I paid the guy some money to say thanks. 

 Other than looking like an beat up piece of junk, it has made countless trips to and from work, an 4 hour drive from Florida to Georgia. My wife didn't think it would make it, or if it did it would breath it's last breath once here. I can count on it to start during the cold spells we have been having. The gas can be a killer on account for, it has turbo on it. But with practice you can learn to shift gears and accelerate with using very minimal turbo.

 I am glad that the money I paid for it has been accounted for. I am glad that my intuition on wether this car would be a good buy or not was right. I expect it to run another year or 2, with luck maybe more. By then my wife and I will be in a better financial position to purchase a newer vehicle<br><br>
