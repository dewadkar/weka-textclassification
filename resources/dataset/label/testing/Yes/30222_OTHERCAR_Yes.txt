            Background:

We had looked at and actually bought a 2002 Honda Odyssey.  Luckily for us, it had a bad paint job so we were able to return it and get a 2003 for the same price.

2002 vs 2003:

There is very little difference between the 2002 and 2003 models.  Both have the new 240hp engine.  Both have the new drink holders in the rear captain's chairs... The main difference that we noticed was the new key system.  The 2003 Odyssey now incorporates a key that has a digital microchip making it very hard to steal.

One other notable difference is that the 2003 has several new colors.  You can now also get the Alpine DVD-based navigation system factory installed.

Advantages:

If you are in the market for a minvan, the 2003 Honda Odyssey is the top of the line.  We looking @ Chrysler, Toyota and of course the Odyssey.

Advantages over Toyota Sienna:

Roomier
More headroom
More storage space
More horsepower
Optional Navigation System

Advantages over Chrysler/Dodge:

More reliable
Fold down into the floor rear seat
More horsepower
Optional Navigation System

Disadvantages:

The one true disadvantage of the 2003 Honda Odyssey is that Honda continues to limit production in such a way that they are not meeting demand.  Because of that, you can expect to pay a premium over sticker price and you will likely have to wait for your van.  This is typical for Honda and creates a situation where the dealer often has the upper-hand.  Needless to say, it's not a consumer-friendly approach to selling cars...

New for 2003:

One option worth considering is the Alpine DVD-Based Navigation system.  We didn't get it in the Odyssey, but I have the same system in my 2002 Acura TL.  It's hard to describe accurately how useful this system really is.  You can find restaurants, gas stations, ATM's, etc.. on the fly.  You can bookmark locations for future return.  You can store common addresses in an address book feature.  The thing even talks to you and is voice enabled.  It costs $2,000 but if you drive a lot like I do, it's worth every penny.

Conclusion:

I wasn't thrilled about the idea of getting a mini-van...  But we needed one and I am completely happy with the Odyssey.  It's worth the money and hassle of waiting to get it.  Our friends settled on a Sienna and now that we have our Odyssey, they realize the mistake that they made...
