            850,000 Square Pixel CCD Sensor, RGB Color filter for Accurate Color, Automatic Flash and optical viewfinder, Built in LCD monitor, Live Video Output, High Speed Serial Interface, Uses SmartMedia technology, has the ability to purchase many extras.

My opinion:
             For beginners this is a fine camera.  On the PC Monitor the picture looks great, but you definately need a high end printer to get a good print of the picture.  Many features, but unable to upgrade to more than 32MB for picture storage.  Has 2 settings for picture quality, 640 X 480 and 1024 X 768. I've owned this unit now for approx 5 months and have not had a problem yet (knock on wood).  The fact that it has alot of features can be confusing when trying to capture that moment.

Paid $350 and got an extended warranty.  Never take chances on computer peripherals.
