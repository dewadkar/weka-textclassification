            <i>Update</i>:My test drive of 2003 models of the Escape and VUE has led me to significantly revise my opinions of these vehicles. For details, see the respective reviews. Hopefully I will drive a 2003 CR-V soon, though I do not expect my evaluation to change as much for it. 

Why would a year make such a difference? Well, I've driven more vehicles, and one in particular, the Subaru Forester, has raised my expectations for small car-based SUVs. The Subaru is currently my top recommendation among these vehicles. Of the three compared here, I am inclined towards the Honda, though I want to take one for a test drive soon to confirm this.

<i>Original review</i>:

Though Honda and Toyota got a few years&#146 head start, the Ford Escape became the best-selling compact SUV just months after its introduction in the summer of 2000 as an early 2001 model. This was no mean feat, since this is the hottest segment in the vehicle market right now. 2002 brings new challenges, foremost among them a redesigned CR-V that reflects all Honda has learned from its mistakes with the original vehicle and GM&#146s first entry, the Saturn VUE. 

The original CR-V did fairly well here, but did have its faults. Designed without the American market in mind, it was grossly underpowered for American tastes, and was a bit flimsy in feel. This became glaringly evident when the Escape arrived with a 3.0 liter six and a more solid feel. This year&#146s second generation CR-V has been designed with the U.S. market in mind. First off, the new CR-V has a 160 horsepower 2.4 liter engine instead of a 146 horsepower 2.0 liter. Much more significant than the boost in high-end power, the new engine produces 162 lb-ft of torque at 3600 RPM, while last year&#146s produced 133 at 4500. Given that most people speed more time near the torque peak than the power peak, this is a significant improvement. Then there is the new body. A bit larger than the old one on the outside, inside the cabin is 3.6 inches wider, contains 2.7 inches more rear leg room, and includes five cubic feet more cargo volume. The new body is also much stiffer, to impart a higher quality feel. This and other changes result in a couple hundred pounds more mass, but the larger engine should more than compensate. Altogether, on paper the second-generation CR-V is a vastly improved vehicle. 

Saturn is a logical place for GM&#146s first compact SUV. The Japanese created this segment, and Saturn was created by GM to copy the Japanese, and especially Honda, as far as product was concerned. Think of the VUE as Saturn&#146s knock-off of the CR-V, and you won&#146t be far off. Major Escape-like differences are an available V6 and a spare tire mounted under the cargo floor rather than hanging off the tailgate. Then there are the usual Saturn plastic body panels and styling quirks. Given this mix of features, the VUE promises to steal sales from both the Ford and the Honda.

So, how does the Escape stack up against these new entries?

<b>Exterior Styling </b>

The Escape is styled to look like a small Explorer. The overall look is sporty with bits of both cuteness (the roundness of most lines) and aggressiveness (the large front bumper) tossed in. The bumpers are unpainted gray urethane to give it an off-road look that probably exceeds its capabilities. The overall theme is fairly plain, but near-perfect proportions and largish wheels give it some punch. Though the Escape is six to nine inches shorter in length than the others, it actually looks larger than the Honda and roughly the same size as the Saturn, partly due to the larger wheels and slightly taller body.

In contrast, the plain stying of the new CR-V to my eye is simply bland. It lacks the flair of the second-generation RAV4, the new Jeep Liberty, or the VUE. It lacks the aggressive proportions and large wheels that save the Escape. It doesn&#146t even have the level of stylishness the original CR-V had, especially in its rounded rear corners. But for some people, notably Honda people, this is a good thing. To their eye the CR-V is just cute and racy enough. They favor the CR-V&#146s &#145sensible&#146 styling, styling that communicates that this is a useful vehicle driven by sensible people. I suppose the new CR-V looks a bit more rugged than the old, if only because the D-pillars are now painted and some Escape-like rubber covers much of the front end, but compared to the average SUV, even the average compact SUV, it&#146s still on the cute end of the scale. 

The VUE looks like a Saturn SUV might be expected to look: clean and friendly with a touch of quirky. Saturn stumbled when its designs got too plain in the late-90s, and it has learned from this experience. In the VUE, some character is provided by flared wheel openings, Audi-esque cutlines where the bumper fascias meet the body (okay, Olds and Saturn did this first, but it looks better on the A6), an upward sweeping indentation in the doors, and a hood that wraps over a bit into the fenders. 

The last warrants a bit more comment. Like the S-Series (small) Saturn, the VUE uses space frame construction. What this means is that the metal frame provides all of the structural strength of the vehicle, enabling the fenders and door skins to be made of plastic. (The larger, L-Series Saturns have plastic front fenders and door skins, but metal rear fenders that contribute to the structure.) On the plus side, these panels resist dents and won&#146t rust (not that vehicles rust much anymore, with today&#146s anti-corrosion technology). The downside of plastic panels is that they expand and contract quite a bit with temperature variations, so the gaps between them must be larger. Some reviews have criticized these gaps on the VUE, saying they allow fingers to be inserted up to the second knuckle. This has not been the case on the VUEs I have seen. The gaps are perhaps twice as broad as those on a Honda or Toyota, but they are much narrower than those I&#146ve seen on past Saturns, and very even. Now for that hood. The VUE&#146s designers appear to have incorporated wider than normal panel gaps into the design. The way the A-pillar and hood are styled accentuate these gaps rather than hide them, lending the product a hyper-functional, overtly structural character where each panel is clearly visible as a distinct part of the whole. I personally think it works. 

A few other features of the exterior design bear mention. The front end is perhaps the most car-like of any SUV, with very horizontal headlamps. Owing to these lamps, the VUE from the font looks like a car that has been given a serious suspension lift. The much more expensive Audi Allroad looks much the same way. Some people expect their SUVs to look more trucky, but then they&#146ll probably want other aspects of the vehicle to be more trucky as well. Think of this front end as truth in styling. The rear end is marked by blacked-out D-pillars, making it look as if the glass wraps around from one side all the way around the back to the other. The original CR-V was similarly styled in this area. That the new one has painted D-pillars, like just about every other SUV, suggests that Honda learned that SUV buyers desire the more rugged, stronger look of painted pillars. Though other features of the VUE&#146s styling may be quirkier, this one may cause Saturn the most heartache.

Some people will not like this or that detail of the design, but Saturn learned the hard way that overly safe designs make its vehicles too similar to everything else, and thus invisible to many potential buyers. Overall, I think they did a good job. The VUE is unique, it looks like a Saturn, and above all it looks both fun and sophisticated. Though about the same size as the CR-V, the VUE has more presence and generally looks much less like a toy SUV. I say cut Saturn some slack and be thankful it&#146s not a blatant copy of the CR-V or Escape. 

I&#146ve said the most about the Saturn because there was simply more to say about it. So how do they all stack up? Well, aesthetics are largely a matter of opinion, even more than other areas. It largely depends on what you like. The Ford is the most trucky and least adult of the three. The Saturn is the most car-like and sophisticated. The Honda is plain WYSIWYG, all function. Take your pick. For me the Saturn probably has the edge.

<b>Interior Styling and Ambiance</b>

Much the same can be said for the interior styling of these vehicles. The Escape&#146s interior is conventional Ford SUV in appearance, with the exception of the white-faced gauges. Since these were introduced by Nissan with the 1989 Maxima SE, they've been springing up inside many cars that aspire to be thought of as sporty. If you like them, chalk up one point for the Ford. The fabric in the Ford is a vinylized finely ribbed cloth that feels and looks very durable and trucky. The Escape is simply styled in and out to be more of a truck. If you want a more luxurious interior but also want the Ford, then get the leather. I sat in an Escape with leather and it certainly lent the vehicle a more luxurious air. Even then, the basic styling and materials used in the interior were functional in a work-truck sort of way. To some eyes, including mine, they look a bit cheap in places. To their credit, they at least aren&#146t trying to look like something they are not.

The CR-V&#146s sensible, utilitarian theme continues to its interior. For 2000 and 2001, an SE model with leather was available. For 2002, the range tops out once more with the cloth-trimmed EX. Anyone who requires leather will either have to buy just about any competitor or go aftermarket. The interior styling, like the exterior styling, is bereft of the racy touches found in the Toyota and Jeep. Like that of the Ford Escape, the interior design is about utility. However, unlike in the Ford, the materials and buttons used all look and feel high in quality. The cloth lacks the vinyl quality of the Escape&#146s, yet has a heavy, grippy texture that similarly suggests durability and functionality. BMWs used to have similar cloth. The combination of high quality with an absence of luxury reminds me of Mercedes interiors ante-Lexus. This combination likely appeals to the same people who like the exterior of the CR-V. Or just about any Honda for that matter. I must admit I was a bit won over by it myself. 

The VUE&#146s interior styling is more conventional than its exterior, but still racier than the others. The gauges and switches generally come from other Saturns. Overall, they look and function well. Some people will object to the power window controls&#146 location near the shifter, but I don&#146t mind it. The cloth is a patterned velour, more luxurious than the others but also much more car-like.

The basic design of the VUE&#146s dash resembles the Lexus RX 300, with the shifter mounted on a shelf that protrudes from the center of the dash. Lower down, on the floor between the seats, Saturn has included a low, non-movable center console with a smallish storage compartment and cupholders. The last might be too low to be used easily. I suspect it&#146s low to attempt to mimic the open feeling in the front seat of the CR-V. Unfortunately, the promontory on which the shifter is mounted kills that effect. I don&#146t mind the sportier ambiance this design lends myself, but there is something to be said from the much more spacious feeling of the CR-V, with its column-mounted shifter, dash-mounted parking brake, and fold-away console. A significant difference to keep in mind, either way. The Escape has a column-mounted shifter, like the Honda, but also has a large center console. This combination puzzles me. At least the center console provides more front seat storage than you&#146ll find in the others.

My least favorite part of the VUE&#146s  interior design is the door panels. The rear half of these, like the center consolve, is made of hard plastic with a pebbled surface texture. It looks and feels cheap. I really liked the padded door panels and armrests of the Saturn L-series. They are much missed here. 

Overall, the VUE&#146s interior is more stylish and car-like than those in the CR-V and Escape, but the quality of some materials takes away from this potential bonus. The higher quality materials in the CR-V reinforce its utilitarian aesthetic. Though the materials in the Escape may be even a notch below those in the Saturn, they are somehow seem less out of place in the Escape&#146s more utilitarian interior design. Redesigning the door panels and center console would help the VUE a great deal.

In this category, the nod goes to the Honda, though none is unpleasant. However, if you require factory leather, the Escape is your only choice among these three. By waiting a year to offer leather, Saturn may be copying Honda a bit much. Leather isn&#146t just for luxury cars anymore, as a company that offers it in its smallest car should know. The dealer can have leather installed in the Honda or the Saturn, but many people want their upholstery to come from the factory.

<i>Update:</i> Leather has now become available in the VUE.

<b>Accommodations</b>

I have already mentioned that the CR-V&#146s interior feels more spacious than the VUE&#146s. This is partly due to its open design, but also because it is more spacious. Though the VUE is three inches longer and an inch wider than the Honda, it has 6% less passenger volume. Most notably, it has an inch less shoulder room (more significant than it would seem) and a whopping three inches less rear legroom (front legroom is virtually identical). The Ford&#146s interior dimensions are close to the Saturn&#146s, but it feels roomier, especially in the back seat.

This last disadvantage may be the largest weakness of the VUE. The new CR-V has a very spacious, , surprisingly comfortable rear seat. It&#146s not just that the Honda has 39.4 inches of rear legroom, which is big car territory. It also helps a great deal that the Honda&#146s rear seat cushion is mounted high off the floor, so it provides thigh support to adult males. 

The rear seat in the Escape is similarly high, such that it offers more thigh support despite providing the same amount of legroom as the VUE on paper. Unfortunately, the Escape&#146s  rear cushion and seatback are extremely flat, such that that despite the available room and high position they would not be a comfortable place to sit for very long.

The VUE&#146s rear seat, in contrast, is nicely contoured but is mounted fairly low, as is frequently the case in GM vehicles. As a result, it provides insufficient thigh support; adults closer to six feet than to five will have a bit of that &#145knees in throat&#146 feeling. It does not help that the map pocket on the back of the driver&#146s seat bulges out, making contact with the shins of this 5�&#148 male. (There is a bit more room behind the passenger seat, which has a plastic back.)

Why didn&#146t Saturn mount the cushion higher? There is more than enough headroom, so that wasn&#146t the limiting factor it often is in sedans. It seems that they wanted to avoid the complexity and expense involved in having the rear seat cushion fold forward when the rear seatback is folded to enlarge the cargo area. In the Honda and Ford, to get a flat load floor the rear seat cushion, because of its height off the floor, must fold forward when the rear seatback does. I don&#146t know how much this costs. I do know its not a major inconvenience in the CR-V. Saturn should have done the same.

The Escape is not without its faults here. Unlike the others, the rear seat headrests must be removed before folding the seat. Also, the mechanism that attaches the cushion to the floor feels much flimsier than in the Honda.

Front seat comfort in the VUE is better. As in the Ford, the seats are moderately firm, softer than those in the Honda but not too much so. Though lateral support is minimal in the Ford and Saturn, you sink in just enough to feel well-supported in regular driving. The cloth grips you in the Honda. Not an uncomfortable front seat in the bunch, though the Honda provides somewhat better support than the others.

The driver&#146s seating position is highest in the Escape, lowest in the VUE, but the front seats in all three vehicles are fairly high up, and combined with a large amount of glass afford excellent visibility, especially forward. Some of the pillars in all three are a bit thick, but none obtrusively so. In the CR-V, VUE, and uplevel Escape, a manual height adjustment is standard. Only the Escape offers a power driver&#146s seat, which aside from requiring less effort allows the seat to be tilted.

Chalk up another win for the CR-V. It has an extremely well designed interior. The Ford comes in second. The Saturn, due to its rear seat, trails the others.

<b>Cargo Versatility</b>

Many people buy SUVs for their interior versatility. The Honda has about 10% more cargo room than the others, largely because it&#146s spare is mounted outside the vehicle. As a result, the cargo floor is lower in the CR-V, and a decent amount of additional storage is available beneath it. Still, many people will be more than willing to give up 10% of their cargo room in exchange for the advantages of having the spare inside. Though this means the spare cannot be full size, it stays cleaner there, and is less likely to rattle. It allows the vehicle to look more sleek and car-like. Perhaps most importantly, in a minor rear collision the spare won&#146t be pushed into the tailgate, causing hundreds of dollars of damage. This is a danger on the CR-V, and on the Toyota RAV4 as well, since the spare extends further rearward than the bumper. 

Sadly, Saturn and Ford have not gone all the way and constructed their rear bumpers to car standards. Small SUVs tend to have weak rear bumpers, such that minor rear collisions result in much damage, and those on the Ford and Saturn appear to continue this tradition.

The story doesn&#146t end with spare tires and cargo space. The Escape is the least versatile of the three. As has already been mentioned, the rear seat headrests must be removed to fold the seat. This is a hassle. Beyond this, it offers none of the unconventional features found in the Honda and Saturn. The split folding rear seat is the only configurable item.

In the VUE (and PT Cruiser, for that matter), the front passenger seatback folds forward to permit very large objects to be carried inside. The VUE also has a cargo organizer that folds out of the floor to form a box about one by three feet in size. It is a bit flimsy, but not nearly to the degree some other reviews have suggested. It should be more than up to the task of keeping small objects or a few grocery bags from rolling about the interior. Of less obvious value, the CR-V includes a removable folding table in the cargo floor. 

Tailgate designs differ among these vehicles. In the Escape and VUE, it opens upward. In the CR-V, it opens to the side. Some people prefer one, some the other. Shorter people can have trouble closing upward opening tailgates, and taller people can hit their heads on them, but they do get more out of the way.  Neither is easy to open in a closed garage. That&#146s where a separately opening liftglass can help. Unfortunately, the VUE, unlike the others, and most of its competitors, does not offer this feature. Because it often preferable to open only the glass, many buyers will be disappointed by this omission. 

In terms of cargo versatility, the Saturn and Honda each have extra features compared to the Escape. Overall, the Honda might have a slight edge here, with the VUE's major advantage being its trick front passenger seat. 

The Escape does have one ace up its sleeve for those who plan to do some towing. The Honda is rated for 1500 lbs., the Saturn V6 for 2500, and the Escape with towing package for 3500. 

<b>Powertrain Performance</b>

So far the CR-V appears to have the edge. But it lacks an available V6 engine. Can the others catch up once the competition moves to the road?

Though the second generation CR-V has a larger, more powerful engine, it&#146s still a four cylinder. The greater torque of this year&#146s engine is very evident, but I still found myself flooring it quite often. At least it avoids sounding strained when subjected to such abuse. Still, some people, myself among them, would much rather have the greater power and more refined sensations of a six. Like the Escape but unlike the CR-V, the VUE is available with both a four and a six. Both engines are slightly modified versions of those in Saturn&#146s L-series cars. They bracket the CR-V&#146s engines in power. While the Honda&#146s four produces 160 horsepower, the VUE&#146s four produces 143 and the its six produces 180.  Nearly all Escapes are sold with a 201 horsepower V6.

Performance is not a simple function of horsepower. Transmissions also affect performance. Saturn provides two unique transmissions in this class. Instead of a conventional automatic, the four will soon be available with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). I have described such a transmission in detail in my A4 review. To cut to the chase here, a CVT permits an engine to be held at the power peak as the vehicle accelerates, such that it produces full power all the time rather than losing a great deal of power every time the transmission shifts and RPM consequently drop. Though the Saturn four makes 10% less power than the Honda&#146s, the CVT should compensate for this. Weight also affects performance, but since the two vehicles&#146 weights are almost identical, their acceleration should be close.  On the downside, holding the engine at a constant RPM feels a bit strange and could result in a great deal of noise unless the engine is very refined, which the Saturn&#146s is not. Since a CVT is not yet available for a test drive, this is all theoretical for now.

The six&#146s acceleration is aided by a five-speed automatic. The extra gear compared to the competition permits a shorter first gear, for quicker acceleration, and a taller top gear, for more relaxed and more economical highway cruising. Since I drove the six, I can go beyond theory in this case. In short, that extra gear is not enough to compensate for a 10% power deficit compared to the similarly hefty Escape. The Escape especially feels stronger at low speeds. Though the Saturn six&#146s acceleration will be more than adequate for 90% of buyers, for those that value acceleration above all else the Escape has an advantage. 

I don&#146t know why the Saturn&#146s six doesn&#146t make more power. It&#146s the same size as that in the Escape, and 180 horsepower is definitely on the low side for a 3.0 liter 24 valve V6. Saturn should be able to find at least 15 more horses here without resorting to premium fuel.

Too much should not be made of this disadvantage. For the great majority of buyers that care about more than 0-60, the VUE will offer an appealing balance. It&#146s six is significantly torquier in feel than the Honda four. Though far from silent, and fairly loud when pushed, it is much more refined sounding than the gruff six in the Escape. When pushed, the Ford V6 makes a lot of noise, and this noise is not good noise. Some engines when they make noise invigorate the driver, they say "this is performance machinery" and beg to be pushed harder. The Ford engine's noise says, "I'm strained, please ease off." The Saturn&#146s six may not offer blistering acceleration, but it never sounds strained or rough. The engine is an Opel (GM of Europe) design, and its European origins are evident here. 

As far as economy goes, the numbers on the VUE&#146s sticker were 19/25, short of the CR-V&#146s 22/26, but better than the Escape&#146s 18/24, and far better than conventional SUVs. Overall, economy in any of these should be comparable to a six-cylinder sedan, with the Honda having an edge.

The VUE&#146s four-wheel-drive system is very similar to that in the Honda. Usually power goes entirely to the front wheels, but if these slip some power is automatically diverted to the rear wheels. This occurs very quickly, and is transparent to the driver. Such a system is generally intended for slippery roads, not going off-road. I drove the VUE over roads with a bit of ice on them, and it performed well. The Escape has a bit of an advantage here. Left in &#145auto,&#146 the Escape&#146s system functions much like those in the Honda and Saturn. But a switch is provided to lock the system in all-wheel-drive, such that torque is split 50/50 between the front and rear, much like in the RAV4. This provides a little more off-road capability, and subtly affects handling. That said, the Escape like the others lacks a low range, and is generally not designed for off-road use.

In powertrain performance, the VUE scores a win.

<b>Chassis Performance</b>

Handling is another VUE strong suit. Much like the new CR-V, it feels solid and composed on the road. Partly due to higher steering effort, the VUE does feel less nimble than the CR-V. Unfortunately, the higher steering effort does not translate into more road feel. The VUE uses an innovative power steering system that gets its assist from an electric motor rather than an engine-driven hydraulic pump (which should aid fuel economy). While this system was a match for the best GM has to offer, and is not noticeably different than conventional power steering, it was not up to Honda standards in road feel. That said, many people, especially men, will prefer the higher effort for the somewhat European, higher performance feel it imparts. 

The VUE rolls less in turns than the CR-V, and perhaps any other vehicle in this class. The Escape is a couple of inches taller than the others, and consequently rolls the most in turns. Though still handling much better than a conventional SUV, and thankfully  possessing firmer steering than other Ford trucks, the Escape generally feels less car-like than the others. It was the only one where I felt that &#145tippy feeling&#146 that attends a high center-of-gravity in aggressive driving.  I do not know if the Escape is actually more likely to roll than the others, but I felt the least comfortable driving it aggressively by a significant margin.

Compared to the Escape, both the VUE and CR-V are significantly quieter and generally feel more refined. Like the CR-V and more so than the Escape, the VUE rides like a good sedan. The low amount of lean for an SUV does not come at the cost of a poor ride. Another win for the Saturn, though the Honda is a close second.

<b>Pricing</b>

Adjusted for options, the six costs $1,665 more than the four, about in line with what the Japanese charge for a six. This amount is fairly reasonable, but could be lower. In the Escape, the six costs $1,510, and that includes an automatic transmission, easily $800 on its own. I suspect that this difference is because Ford doesn&#146t intend to sell many Escapes with the four, while Saturn does. 

This cost difference filters through to the bottom line. The stickers are not too far apart: the Escapes with similar equipment (the main difference being a power seat in the Ford) is about $200 less. But Saturns sell at sticker, while a thousand-dollar discount (or more) shouldn&#146t be hard to find on the Ford. 

Compared to the CR-V, the VUE may also have a hard time on price. Though in this case both should sell at sticker, the VUE with the four stickers for nearly a grand more than the CR-V, adjusted for equipment. Get the six, and you&#146re looking at $2,600 more than the Honda, a sizable chunk of change. 

<b>Last Words</b>

Though the prices could be a bit lower, the VUE has much to recommend it. It is the most car-like of the three in many ways. It has unique, sophisticated styling. Its six is reasonably powerful and refined. Its steering is firm, and it rolls less than the competition in turns, yet it also rides comfortably. Visibility from the driver&#146s seat is very good, and the cargo area is fairly versatile. Perhaps more than any of these individual strengths, the combination of them is appealing. They add up to a more adult yet still fun vehicle than the competition. Overall, for many buyers I suspect these strengths will outweigh the VUE&#146s weaknesses, most notably the quality of some interior materials, insufficient room and thigh support in the rear seat, and the non-opening tailgate window. A final factor that will affect many decisions is the Saturn dealer experience.  Saturn dealers are well known for treating their customers well, even too well for those who find all the friendly overtures over the top. A more stress-free buying and owning experience cannot be found anywhere.

This said, the Honda has the most intelligently designed and thus most functional interior. It&#146s seats are also the most comfortable, especially in the rear. With a six, it would be the clear winner. If you don&#146t feel the need for a six and like the &#145styling,&#146 it is the winner. 

Or, if you prefer a manual transmission, it is the winner. The sixes in the others come only with automatic transmissions, and although the fours are available with manuals they are inferior engines to that in the CR-V. Also, Honda tends to execute a better manual powertrain. I personally prefer a manual, and strongly dislike the increasing tendency for them to only be available with the base engine (Saturn VUE and L-Series, Lincoln LS, Mercedes C-Class, Toyota Camry...)

Though still the sales leader, I have a hard time recommending the Escape over either of the others on functional grounds. Though far from a bad choice, it simply lacks the refinement of the others, and posts clear wins only in all-out acceleration and towing ability. But function isn't everything. The VUE's styling may be too car-like and quirky for many SUV buyers. For those who want their SUV to have the tough look of a conventional SUV, and find the CR-V too weak in looks and engine, the Escape will still have the most appeal of the three.

<i>Update:</i> I have now driven the Escape in Limited trim, which is new for 2003. This test drive further refined my view of the Escape. The review can be found here:
