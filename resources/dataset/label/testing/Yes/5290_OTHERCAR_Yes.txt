            Repeatedly, I find myself thinking to myself how practical this car is. My last car was on its last legs and I needed to buy something that was practical and could put up with long commutes and the ins-and-outs of a being a daily driver for a college student in the city. I was considering cars that were more aggressive and fun to drive, like a Prelude or even a Maxima, but the Accord came through with its all around packaging.

I can very comfortably fit five passengers in my car without any problems, unlike many of my friends' cars, which tend to be smaller compact cars. I also find that the trunk is surprisingly large for a car its size and I can fit a large pieces of luggage in it with ease. I've never had a capacity problem. For boxes which didn't fit in the trunk, I was able to squeeze them in through the front or rear doors, though it took some effort. I recently moved computers (with large monitors) in their boxes as well as a 5-speaker home theater system with a 12&quot; subwoofer (these have very large and heavy boxes) in my car, which was quite impressive.

Everyone comments about how smooth the ride is in the car. The car runs very well and the engine's power delivery is efficient without being too loud or harsh. The clutch is soft and easy to learn to use, even for a first-time 5-speed driver. The gearing is solid and the prevention of allowing inexperienced drivers shift without engaging the clutch is a great help to those learning to drive the car. The fuel economy is solid at about 30 mpg on the highway.

I've made some modifications to the car along the lines of increasing its ability to handle well and accelerate. The number of aftermarket parts available for the car is low to moderate, though it is increasing. The import racing scene has driven the market to bring about parts for modification. However, I don't recommend modifying this car very much because it's not intended to be raced to any degree. If you do want to race it, expect to pay a lot of money to modify it to compete with other cars which are similarly modified, but much faster.
