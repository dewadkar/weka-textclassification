                 I have a 1999 Corvette coupe with the (in)famous 6-speed Borg-Warner manual transmission. This is the only production car I know of that one must pay extra for the manual transmission vs an automatic. This transmission has a computer assisted shift in gears 1 - 4 which &quot;helps&quot; you shift when certain parameters such as RPM and torque are reached. Disconnect this immediately if you are a serious driver. Midland and other after market parts dealers sell a plug for the wire harness connector that seals it off after disconnection. This gizmo literally seizes the gear shift when the computer determines it's time to shift and makes it nearly impossible to get the transmission in or out of any gear. Turn it off!
I had the unfortunate experience of getting a bad transmission that had to be replaced after only 6000 miles but even the new transmission had this problem. Once disconnected the shift sequence is typical heavy clutch Corvette with a solid engagement that inspires confident high-load shifting. 
     The other good drivability features are the metal pedals (except when wet), the telescoping steering wheel (turn on the easy-in, easy out feature which extends/retracts the steering wheel and seat upon entry/exit) and the excellent stopping power of the 4-wheel disk brakes and Goodyear run-flat tires. Then there's the make-the-telephones-look-like-a-picket-fence acceleration. Not as fast as a Viper or a 911 but very, very close. I added K &amp; N intakes and a Corsa exhaust system to eliminate a slight low RPM hesitation and am quite satisfied with the performance. This car has gotten me out of some very hairy situations when other people decide they would rather finish their cell phone conversations or stir their coffee than stop for red lights or actually notify other drivers of their immediate intention to change lanes in front of them. The C5 Corvette (1997 - ???) has a much better weight distribution than previous models but never forget the tendency to slide in hard turns due to the light rear end is still a factor with a Corvette.
Otherwise the handling is superior to most other sports cars. One feature I choose to avoid after test driving a model with it was 'Active Handling'. The car comes with a video that explains this as a set of computers and sensors which determines when the car is &quot;out of shape&quot; (or being driven over preset handling limits) and alternatively applies the brake on one or more wheels to straighten out the line of steering and presumably help the driver avoid a spin or crash. To test this I intentionally cranked the steering wheel hard right at about 50 MPH to see what would happen. This device took over and nearly put the salesman and I  into oncoming traffic as it forced the car back hard left after I had attempted to correct the slide by steering back left myself. If you already know how to drive out of a skid, leave this item off your Corvette until they really get it down right. The same goes for anti-lock brakes, DON'T pump them as you would normal brakes since they're pumping themselves automatically. This feature is standard and you just have to get used to it. 
     All in all I love this car. It's fast, stylish and will never be mistaken for a family sedan. In comparison to a zero-room $65,000 Viper or a skittish $87,000 911 you definitely get your money's worth.<br><br>
