            Disclaimer: I am the wife of a Jeep owner. I write this review claiming total ignorance of the mechanical workings of a Jeep. I speak only from my personal experience which does not include technical expertise!

My husband bought his Jeep in 1993 when he was still single. He made sure it was in red and he kept it looking brand new.  I have to admit that I did not notice my husband at first amidst the swarm of young single soldiers I met that day.  However I did remember that Jeep! 

Parked out front of the barracks sparkling in the sun. My heart began to race. What can I say? The myth is true...some women can be impressed by the type of car you drive. There is just something about a red Jeep Wrangler that does more for a guy than he could ever imagine...

We've been married now for 5 years and I can't say I owe a happy marriage to that Jeep but I will tell you this--I accepted a first date solely on the basis of getting to ride down the road in that fine automobile. 

Fast forward several years.....we now have kids! Guess what? This is not exactly a family car.  It's not a 4 door sedan with a quiet ride and plenty of trunk space for strollers. But that's not what it's made for either. So the Jeep is not our family car but my husband doesn't know that...

He tossed our daughter in that Jeep as soon as he got her home from the hospital. Strapped her in her carseat and took her for a whirl. He did not go 4 wheeling with her (at least not at that time he didn't!) or do anything unsafe so don't worry...but I will tell you one thing. We have a daughter who loves her Daddy's Jeep. How could she not when she grew up in it practically.

One of the best things that ever happened to that Jeep was when we moved to New Mexico.  Suddenly a whole world opened up to my husband. He and his other Jeep buddies take their cars out into the mountains and ride over these big rocks. Hey, it's not my cup of tea but the smile on his face when he gets back from these adventures just has to tell you in your heart that this is the ideal man's toy!

The Jeep is loud. It bounces you all over the road. I had to stop riding in it altogether when I was pregnant because if I had any &quot;morning sickness&quot; at all I could never survive the ride if you know what I mean! You can't say this is a &quot;con&quot; though about the Jeep because you wouldn't buy one as your sole vehicle if this bothered you.

I have two complaints. One is the gas mileage. It is horrible! We put more money into the Jeep's gas than we put in my car in two months.  That is just par for the course though. Again you accept that before you buy one.

 Secondly our gas gauge has never read correctly. No matter how many times we have it repaired it just doesn't work. It always reads 1/4 tank of gas when you really have none. As a result we have run out of gas many times. Now we just don't let it go below 1/2 because you never know after that how close you are to empty! This could be just a fluke in our Jeep for all I know.

My husband is constantly doing things to this Jeep. He is lifting it, adding things to it, putting things on it. If you buy this type of a vehicle it seems to me that it will have one on-going expense-- buying the additional toys to add on to your toy. 

It's like the computer. Whenever he gets it just like he wants it...he finds something else he wants. He has gotten more enjoyment from that Jeep than I could have ever imagined. Sure we just spent 160 dollars on a rack and I know it won't end there.

 Last month we spent the same amount on something else he ordered out of the Jeep magazine. I have no idea what.  The car payments ceased long ago but we still pay monthly on that car with whatever additional toys he likes to add on to it. That's ok with me though! He enjoys it and has a great time. My husband could spend a whole afternoon in that garage working on that Jeep and be totally at peace with the world.

We have never had to do any major repairs except one time. A year ago it went in the shop and had to have 800 dollars of work on it. The car is 7 years old and if you ask me that is not so bad for a car getting on up there in age.

 The car still looks as great as it did the day I first laid eyes on it. At least 5 people a year stop my husband in the parking lot and ask him if he is selling. 

Jeep owners also seem to have a certain respect for one another. Whenever we pass someone else on the road with a Jeep they automatically wave. There is just something about owning a Jeep. You have to have the personality for it but if you do..you are guaranteed a grand adventure!<br><br>
