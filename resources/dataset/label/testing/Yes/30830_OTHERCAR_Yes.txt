            The Olympus D340R is a solid digital camera for it's price range.  You can expect to take some excellent shots of still life without having to know too much about photography or computers.  

The Olympus D340R was my first purchase of a digital camera and met all the specifications that I deemed necessary for what I was trying to accomplish.  It came with easy to use software for downloading the pictures, had a zoom feature, an 8 mg memory card, 1.3 megapixels and under $400.00.  At the time of the purchase of the camera, it was the best camera on the market for under $300.00.

My purpose for purchasing the camera was to take photos of high school athletes and post them to the internet.  The 8 mg memory card allowed me to take 122 photos of the lowest quality (which were still very good at the lowest setting) or to take a smaller number of pictures at higher quality.  

The most positive point of the camera was the price.  It is also very easy to use and explain the basic features of the camera.  I was able to hand it to person with no experience on the camera with the basic instructions of point and click and they came back with some great shots.

The camera also has several negatives.  Batteries only last for about 3 sets of taking 100+ pictures and downloading them with the software.  This can get to be expensive (but not as expensive as having roll after roll developed) and you need to be sure and have a spare set of batteries on hand.  The zoom feature isn't very useful and you have to be careful about the angles you use for shots.  Over half of the shots came out blurry.  There is also a delay from when you push the button to when to picture actually takes so you need to plan that into your shot.  Finally, the pictures used for the more advanced controls on the camera aren't very helpful and can even be confusing to someone using the camera for the first time.  

It would be a perfect camera for someone who wants an inexpensive digital camera that takes pictures of things that aren't moving.  It will also work for anyone else who is willing to practice with it for other applications.  <br><br>
