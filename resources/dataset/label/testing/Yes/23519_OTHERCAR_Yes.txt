            The Audi S4 is one of the greatest deals on the car market today.  What more could you possibly ask for from a car of this size?  Do you want speed?  The Audi S4 has plenty to offer throughout the entire torque curve, giving the driver the ultimate control over any driving situation where acceleration is needed.  Don't forget the fact that the S4 can beat a Camaro SS off the line too!  We are talking a 0-60 time of 5.5 seconds (faster as you get used to the clutch)!  When you combine these kinds of numbers with the outstanding quattro (series IV), you have one serious driving machine.  Did i mention the fact that the all-wheel drive quattro system is so good that it was banned from the rally racing circuit in Europe because Audi dominated every race they entered?  
    Alright, now that I've drooled over the performance, let's focus on the everyday aspects of this beautiful car.  First of all, the S4 is a very neutral feeling car that always keeps the driver in control (credit that to the quattro system).  It's suspension is stiff without being harsh and it's interior is spacious for a car it's size.  Unlike the racing tuned BMW M3, the Audi S4 has the capability of feeling like a humble family sedan or a race car that better belongs on the track.  The combination of it's sportiness and it's real-world usability make it the best value on the import market today.  I live in Michigan, and the S4's quattro system makes it a driveable car all year round.  This is the car for anyone that wants fun and practicality wrapped up into one great little car.
