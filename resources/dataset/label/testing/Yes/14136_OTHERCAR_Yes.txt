                 Being a long time user of film cameras, it was a hard decision to switch to a digital camera.  As I'm not a pro photographer or anything, I wanted a cheap reliable quality camera.  The Finepix 1300 was definitely the right choice.  It's got the features, the picture quality, the cool LCD, and easy to use software.

<b>Pic Quality</b>
The quality of the Finepix is not the best quality, but then again look at the price.  If you aren't a serious photographer, I don't think you'll mind the quality.  

There are three quality options: fine, normal, and basic.  Fine allows you to take 20 pics.  Normal allows you to take 24 pics.  Basic allows you to take 31 pics.  Or, you can switch the size of the pics to 640, and then you can take 45 pics.

<b>Computer</b>
The Finepix comes with a USB cable and cdrom software to upload your pictures onto your computer.  It's very easy to use and install.  This is a big plus for the camera.  The software programs for the computer are Exif Viewer, which lets you view your pictures, and there is DP editor, which lets you print your pictures.

<b>Features</b>
The camera has a lot of nifty features.  It is set up into three modes: One to store and view your pics, one to take pictures, and one with options such as time and date.  Everthing is easy to use, except I had trouble scrolling through pictures I had taken, but I quickly figured it out.  Deleting pictures can be complicated, but with time you could do it with eyes closed.  There is a small LCD screen and a viewfinder, you can use which ever you prefer to take pictures with.  I love the LCD screen, it looks like a camcorder!

<b>Other</b>
Some problems with the camera are the lack of a zoom lens and a lens cover.  They aren't big things, but serious photographers might want something more substantial.

Overall, a great camera, especially for the price.  Definitely worth getting if you aren't a serious photographer.
