            Offered in both XLT and Lariat trim levels, the 2001 F-150 SuperCrew has been designed for consumers who want more interior space without compromising the functional capability and versatility of a full-size pickup. 

Unlike the SuperCab, which has smaller hinged doors that swing out from the C-pillar, the SuperCrew actually mates an Expedition cabin with a shortened cargo bed. It has four full-size doors separated by a B-pillar on each side, with inside and outside handles on each door. Despite the larger cabin, the F-150 SuperCrew is still the same overall length as the SuperCab model (Though this doesn't mean that the F-150 is as easy to park as an Escort, mind you.). 

The SuperCrew boasts 12 inches more cab length than the 2000 SuperCab model. A front 40/60 bench seat, which seats up to three people, is standard. Captain's chairs with a floor-mounted center console are optional. A full-size 60/40 split-fold rear seat is standard, increasing interior space versatility. It can accommodate passengers, bulky loads or a combination of both. The rear seating area also features a power point, reading lamps and cupholders. 

The F-150 SuperCrew's interior also includes standard power adjustable pedals. The brake and accelerator pedals can be adjusted up to 3 inches rearward in a horizontal plane from their standard location. This provides greater comfort for a wider range of drivers, as well as moving shorter stature drivers further away from the front airbag. 

The side effect of the increased interior space is a reduction in bed length. The pickup box measures 5.5 feet long, about a foot shorter than the normal F-150 bed. Width is the same as all other F-150 trucks. Ford believes the increased versatility of four doors will outweigh the loss of maximum cargo space. 

Larger items (such as 4x8 sheets of plywood) will fit between the wheel humps and can be carried with the tailgate lowered. An optional bed extender allows more flexibility when transporting large items such as lumber, cinder blocks or firewood. The tubular steel bed extender is a curved cage unit attaching to the rear of the pickup bed. With the tailgate lowered, the unit pivots from its stowed position within the box and locks into place extending the load floor to 7 feet. With the tailgate closed the stowed bed extender provides a convenient storage area, keeping smaller items from sliding around the bed while the truck is in motion. The bed extender can also be removed, allowing full, unobstructed use of the cargo box. Standard payload of 1,765 pounds is the same as the F-150 SuperCab. 

The F-150 SuperCrew offers a choice of two V8 engines, each with a four-speed automatic transmission. The two-valve, 4.6-liter SOHC V8 delivers 220 horsepower at 4,500 rpm. Peak torque is 290 foot-pounds at 3,250 rpm. The two-valve, 5.4-liter SOHC V8 delivers a maximum power output of 260 horsepower at 4,500 rpm with torque of 350 foot-pounds at 2,500 rpm. Both engines meet federal low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. 

The Ford F-150 is the top-selling vehicle in America, so there's no reason to doubt that the SuperCrew will be a success. The smaller bed will certainly make some people dismiss the SuperCrew, but the advantage of four real doors shouldn't be ignored.<br><br>
