               Who'da thunk Hyundai could build a car like this 2001 Elantra? After test driving Honda Civics, Toyota Corollas, Saturns, Ford Focus's, VW Golfs and Acura Integras, I found the 2001 Elantra (which is, by the way, vastly different from the 2000 model) to be amongst the elite few cars, one being the Ford Focus, which feels and handles like a much larger car. The engine was the most powerful and smoothest of the lot and the transmission shifted effortlessly like that of a large American car. The new design looks very european and the larger 15&quot; wheels, standard for 2001, make for a fun ride. The interior was the largest, by far, of all the cars I've road tested and the quality of materials as well as the interior design are top notch (the only complaint I have is that the rear defroster is mediocre).The other cars just seemed, well, basic compared to the Hyundai which, I kid you not, felt and drove like a premium car. An abundance of standard features literally keep you from leaving the showroom without buying one. Never thought I'd drive a Hyundai. The warrantee is tops so we'll see how the car holds up and if this is, indeed, a &quot;new company&quot;. So far so good.<br><br>
