            I purchased this little camera to put photos on my ebay auctions and it's been just fine for that purpose.  It's lacking the features you'll find in the higher end (read: more expensive) models, but takes a good picture.  One thing that's bothersome is the lack of space in memory.  In fine mode you can only take 3-4 pictures before downloading.  This can make it a time consuming process if you have a lot to get done.  I've found standard mode really isn't clear enough.

There's also no zoom, and so you have to get close which can make the flash wash out the item.  However, if you're able to take the pictures in daylight, it's a lot better.

It came with software to crop, resize, and adjust your pictures, but I prefer to use the software than I got with my scanner.  

For the price (under $100 from various online retailers including tigerdirect) it's well worth it.  I hesitated to spend any more for a high-end camera since the prices are dropping on them.  In my opinion you'll be able to buy on of the pricey models for about half their original price buy the end of this year.  This camera is great just to get you by.
