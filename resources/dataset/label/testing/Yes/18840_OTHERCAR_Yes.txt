            I bought this car 3 years ago and since then I've put on 40,000 miles on it.  For the most  part, it has given me relatively little problems.  Just a few minor repairs here and there.  After all, it is 16 years old.  I originally bought the car because I heard that the 22r engines in these pickups were very reliable, and that was a good car for the winter and offroad.  So far, that has been the case. The car is at 180,000 miles now and its still going strong.  Its starting to burn oil and leaking as well.  But its the original motor and it does have high mileage so what do you expect?  Its unavoidable when you own a car that age.  As far as the interior goes, I think it is a pretty good design(for 1985) They virtually kept the same design from 1984 to 1988.  Its a little cramped in there and the Xtra cab won't fit a person comfortably but I have done it though (very uncomfortable).  But what are comfortable are the seats, as well as the ride. I cruise on the highway at 70 without any hesitation or problems at but it does get a little noisy. Also, all the buttons and gadgets are conveniently located and are really easy to operate.  As far a the exterior goes, its a plus also.  Aside from the fact that it looks good, the high clearance insures that you can go on almost any off road trail.  And have I mentioned how fun it is off-roading with this?  You'd have to experience it yourself.
All in all, I love my pickup truck.  Its reliable, very convenient around the house to do small jobs, and a fun car to drive.  The only major problem I have been notified is that these engines are notorious for blown head gaskets.  That usually happens around the 100,000 mark and i've gone 80,000 miles over that, and so far no problem!
If you are looking for a reliable, fun truck that won't cost that much at all, I think this is it right here.
