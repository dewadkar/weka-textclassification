            I took a chance on the Contour when it first came out.  The only regret I have comes from selling the car.  I don't think I fully appreciated the car until after it was gone.  <br>  I had three warranty repairs done.  The first problem was a leak in the power steering reservoir.  Later on, a friend leaned against the cup holder and broke it.  Ford repaired both problems no questions asked, which was nice.  The cup holder must have been problematic, since Ford installed a much more solid unit to replace the broken one.  The last problem was the fuel door.  The cable that operates the fuel door snakes all over the underside of the car on its way from the driver's door to the right rear corner of the car.  It was not strong enough to reliably open the fuel door.  The cable would flex instead.  Ford's &quot;solution&quot; was to remove or weaken the latch spring on the fuel door.  Not very classy, but the fuel door worked.<br>  <br>  The four cylinder engine is a solid design.  It is a respectable performer when mated to a manual transmission.  It is not so respectable with an automatic.  If you want an automatic, then get the V6.  For the fanatics out there, Ford offers the SVT.<br>  <br>  I commute 80 miles a day to and from work, often in stop and go traffic.  The Contour always returned at least 30 mpg.  On road trips, the car would do approximately 35 mpg.<br>  <br>  The interior is compact but well laid out.  Tall drivers will need a tilt wheel (not standard).  Opting for the manual transmission costs one cup holder.  Other than that, the interior offers good ergonomics.  Cargo space is good for a small car.  Fit and finish are mediocre.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty picky about seats, and I am rarely comfortable sitting in a car seat.  Maybe it's just me but I could drive the Contour all day in complete comfort.  The back seat offers enough room for two adults.  My heavily built, 6' 5&quot; cousin had no complaints riding back there.<br>  <br>  Overall, the Contour offers very good basic transportation.  Anyone that needs a good, economical driver should look at this car.<br><br><br>
