            I finally decided to snap into the new technology and buy a digital camera. I was going to buy some cheap one for $99.00 but one lady that worked there came to me and showed me the Kodak CX4300. I was taken buy all of the features! 

It has 3.2 mega pixels, X4 zoom, self timer, close up feature, picture quality settings from good, better, best. The lower the quality of picture you take, the more picture can be stored on the camera. Also has a time stamp, and an orientation sensor, so if you have to turn the camera side ways, your picture will come out normal instead of side ways. On the picture menu you can magnify, protect, have a slide show, copy, get multiple view of all your pictures, and get picture information. 

It has a very sharp image on the LED screen, also is great for enlarging. This camera is very easy to use (it was my first digital) so I recommend this to advanced users and also beginners. Very light weight and semi compact. 

The whole package includes: The camera, 2 AA Kodak batteries, software for you computer, usb cord to plug into your camera and computer for easy transfer of pictures, a cord to plug into your tv so you can review pictures on it (very cool) and of course, manuals and warranty information.

You can also buy the "easy share dock", you send your camera in it, and it recharges your batteries, and with the press of a button you can share your pictures, and instantly transfer your pictures to your computer.
