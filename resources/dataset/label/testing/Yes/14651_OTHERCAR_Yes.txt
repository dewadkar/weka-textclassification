            I owned a 1991 Hyundai Scoupe LS, 2 door with sunroof and spoiler, and I absolutely loved it.  It was sporty, and although it is a small car, it was pretty comfortable to drive in.  I felt safe in my Scoupe, and it proved me right when it was totaled 4 months ago.  The Scoupe was excellent on gas and it was a car that I loved to drive.  I currently own a 1990 Pontiac Sunbird SE 2 door and I would give anything to have my Scoupe back.  My Scoupe was only a 4 cylinder automatic, but it could go. 

The bad side to owning an older Hyundai is that the body tends to rust easy, as did my Scoupe.  When I bought the car, there was no signs of rust and two months later rust holes were beginning to make an appearance.  It ended up rusting pretty bad, and I was going to get it fixed but things just didn't work out that way (car accident).

The biggest problem I had was when the transmission had to be replaced.  It was difficult to find a transmission to put in it, and very expensive.  Tires were also expensive because not just any tire would do.  The Scoupe requires certain tires that almost doubled the price of any other regular tire.

In the end, I considered the Hyundai Scoupe to be a pretty decent little car.  It is excellent for a new driver, although repairs can be expensive.
Put it this way, I would definitely buy another!!<br><br>
