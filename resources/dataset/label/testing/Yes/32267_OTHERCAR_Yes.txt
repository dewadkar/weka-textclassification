            Nikon was late in coming to the consumer digital camera arena, but in 1998, with the introduction of the Coolpix 900, they threw down the corporate gauntlet and made it clear that they were serious players. A continuous stream of technical advances, performance improvements, innovation, consumer input, and cutting edge features during those three short years have ensured that Nikon�s Coolpix line has become the standard by which other consumer digital camera lines are measured.  High quality Nikkor zoom lenses, compact size, sturdy construction, advanced features, and a complete range of add on accessories have added luster to that well deserved reputation.

The Nikon Coolpix 990, introduced a bit more than a year ago, was a very dramatic improvement over its predecessor (the Coolpix 950) the 990 added enhanced resolution (3.34MP vs 2.1MP), improved ergonomics, a much better feature set, and superior usability. The new Coolpix 995�s improvements over the 990, are not as dramatic but they are significant, and important. How does Nikon�s new flagship prosumer digicam stack up against its competition? After a thorough and comprehensive test, the Coolpix 995 is clearly a worthy addition to the family. 


The CP995 incorporates all the best features of its predecessor, and lots of neat new stuff too. Nikon kept the digital matrix metering and the tilt/swivel lens from the Coolpix 900 family (I always wondered why somebody hasn�t tried combining Nikon�s tilt/swivel zoom lens with Canon�s tilt/swivel LCD screen from the Pro 90IS, & G1) and the basic design of the popular CP990. The Coolpix 995 is packed with features that make shooting stunning images a piece of cake; like a new 7-blade lens diaphragm for true depth of field control, and a new Noise Reduction mode for dramatically improved resolution during long exposures. The Quick Review function, which lets you review images while still in shooting mode (first seen on the CP880) is a convenient way to instantly check and see if you got the shot. 

All previous Coolpix cameras (and most other 3 megapixel digital cameras) featured a 3X optical zoom, the CP995 ups the ante with a newly designed 4x optical zoom lens that provides photographers with thirty per cent more reach, yet remains basically the same size and doesn�t compromise the amazing macro capabilities of the earlier lens. The stepless 4X digital zoom has been completely re-engineered and produces much better quality images than previous digital zooms. The power zoom mechanism is smoother and not as noisy as the one used on the CP990. This increased zoom capability can make the difference between a getting a killer image and ending up with another image that is a candidate for the delete function. 

The CP 995 improves flash performance (over the CP990) by moving the newly designed pop-up flash about two inches away from the lens axis (which reduces re-eye problems, a major complaint with the CP990) and adding about 20% to its range. In addition you can now use Nikon's optional lens attachments (wide-angle or telephoto adapters) and still use (Nikon only) external flash; the CP990 wouldn�t allow both to be used simultaneously.  Another significant improvement is the number of resolution options. With the 990, the only options were 2048x1536, 1024x768, or 640x480. The Coolpix 995 adds several additional resolution levels. The CP995 has added a CompactFlash Type II card slot (IBM Microdrives work but Nikon doesn�t sanction their use) and you can use the high speed 8x, 10x and 12x CF cards from Lexar (which can cut �write� times by up to fifty per cent)

The Coolpix 995 comes packed with the Nikon EN-EL1 lithium rechargeable battery pack (the same battery pack used in the Coolpix 880) and can also use widely available 2CR5 6V lithium batteries. The MH-51 charger (included) can charge a fully depleted battery pack in about 2 hours, additional battery packs run about $35.00-$40.00. The new battery pack saves about two ounces in weight, and battery life is substantially improved

Other improvements include improved Auto-focus accuracy (from 4,896 to 7,193 steps) and an AE Bracketing feature which can be set to vary both the exposure value and the white balance (the new white-balance bracketing feature provides three versions of the same shot, one with the user chosen white-balance setting, one with a slightly warmer cast, and one with a slightly cooler cast).  Maximum shutter speed has been more than doubled, from 1/1000th to 1/2300th of a second.

New in-camera Image Manipulation Options, include image sharpening, color saturation level control, and contrast level adjustments. A top ISO (equivalent) sensitivity setting of 800 (the CP990�s top setting was 400 ISO) will extend low light shooting options (especially when coupled with the new noise reduction mode) The Coolpix 995 is compatible with all existing 900 series accessories, including add-on lenses and external flash.


<b>In the field/Handling and operation</b>

About a year ago I did an extensive test of the Coolpix 990, and I thought it would be fun to duplicate those tests as closely as possible, and then compare similar shots taken with the CP990 and those shot with the updated and improved CP995.  Based on those comparisons (and the overall results from my CP995 tests) Nikon has been listening to the complaints, ideas, and suggestions of their customers.  Many of the improvements and enhancements featured in the Coolpix 995 were those that were most frequently requested by owners of earlier Coolpix models. The result is a camera that comes very close to defining the high end of the 3 megapixel curve in terms of capability, function, and usability.

Louisville has one of the best City park systems in the United States, and most of this system of parks was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, America�s most famous Landscape Architect. Iroquois Park in Louisville�s south end covers a large heavily forested hill that rises more than 800 feet above the surrounding suburbs. Once you are inside the park, it is quite easy to believe that you are "out in the country" rather than completely surrounded by a large metropolitan area. Olmsted designed a wildflower meadow with several small wetlands areas near the top of the hill, and this quiet and serene hilltop refuge from the busy city has recently been restored to its late nineteenth century appearance. 

The area is a photographer�s paradise, especially in the spring, and fall, with a large prairie/meadow area filled with dozens of varieties of colorful wildflowers, and small swampy areas with tiny pools of open water, it�s the perfect place to try out a new camera.  My friend and I spent a warm Saturday afternoon shooting wildflowers up close with the new Coolpix 995 (and with a Nikon N90S for comparison purposes) The images were stunning, and the new in-camera image manipulation options (sharpening, saturation, and contrast adjustments) really made a lot of difference.  The closer the first generation image is to the finished product the better, because with each level of manipulation (whether digital or 35mm) the image suffers a small loss of overall quality. The CP995 allows the photographer more input into the primary image, reducing the need for major manipulation (and the resultant resolution loss) in photoshop.  The color quality comparisons between the digital images and the 35mm Ektachrome 100 slides showed the best digital color I have seen to date, very close to the quality level of medium speed 35mm slide film.


The following Saturday, my friend and I shot a group of young skateboarders practicing their moves along Bardstown Road.  While the Coolpix 995 responds better than most non-professional digital cameras, it just wasn�t really fast enough in operation for serious street work.  This is a genre of photography where the ability to capture the <i>decisive moment</i> makes all the difference in whether an image makes the grade or fails. As soon as we started shooting, the kids really got charged up and displayed a lot of attitude (they were obviously impressed that two adults were taking pictures of their antics).  Several of these kids were absolutely astounding athletes. When I reviewed the images, they looked OK, but when they were displayed on a large monitor I was quite disappointed because in several shots of the skateboarders in mid-air (doing some pretty impressive show-off acrobatics) the images weren�t sharp or the camera had missed the precise moment that would have made the shot. The images from the CP995 were all blurred (to a lesser or greater degree) while similar images shot with the Nikon N90S (and a 35-105 Nikkor Zoom) had managed to freeze the action beautifully. 

The new 4X zoom works very nicely and framing is much easier than with the 3X zoom on the CP990. The 256 element Digital Matrix metering is superb (right on the money) and the auto white balance setting will handle 90% of all shooting situations.

My friend and then I shot some images at a neighborhodd weekend farmers market, small stands loaded down with colorful fruits, flowers, and vegetables set up in a church parking lot.  The small market was brimming over with charming, colorful, and always slightly eccentric Highlands neighborhood characters.  It was a beautiful day with azure blue skies, and puffy white cotton-ball clouds. The static images (both digital and 35mm) from the farmer�s market were gorgeous, with little noticeable difference between the digital and film images.  All in all, a lovely way to spend a late summer day and a very educational and productive photographic outing.

<b>A few concerns</b>

While Nikon doesn�t encourage the use of IBM microdrives, they function well and can be used with the CP995, but if the camera is damaged (while using a microdrive) it will void the warranty.  The new CP995 lacks a low-light focus illuminator, a puzzling omission considering the incredibly well thought out feature set.  I would have liked to see Nikon add a 4 megapixel CCD to this updated Coolpix (which would have provided enough resolution improvement to allow for 11X14 enlargements) both Olympus and Sony have Consumer 4 megapixel cameras, and I think Nikon should have utilized this opportunity to upgrade the resolution level of the CP995, and make it clearly the very best consumer digital camera on the market. 

<b>Conclusion</b>

Nikon is justly famous as a leader in the photo/optics industry.  For more than seven decades Nikon optics and cameras have set the standard for quality, function, durability, and usability.  Nikon has been very successful at translating that long history of quality and experience to a series of innovative and technologically advanced digital cameras, and claiming a significant share of the digital imaging market worldwide. The key to Nikon�s marketing strategy has always been the combination of excellent image quality and an amazing range of advanced features, all designed to provide the serious and demanding photographer with the maximum level of individual control over the picture-taking process.

 
The Nikon Coolpix 995 with it's exceptional images, amazing macro capabilities, and wide range of manual exposure options is an excellent choice for most amateur/advanced amateur photographers. The new Color Saturation, Contrast Enhancement, and Sharpness settings offer lots of user input and an additional level of control. A great selection of metering modes, and drive modes give the CP995 the sort of versatility, functionality, and usability most often seen in a high end 35mm SLR.  Despite all these advanced features, the CP995 can still easily be used as a  'point and shoot' camera in the fully automatic mode. If you are in the market for a superb 3 megapixel digital camera, Nikon�s new Coolpix 995 won�t let you down.
