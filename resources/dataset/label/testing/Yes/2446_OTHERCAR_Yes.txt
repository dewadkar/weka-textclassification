            I bought my Toyota Tacoma 4WD Xtra Cab in September of 2001.  At the time I belonged to a hunting club and the 4WD made the treks through the woods effortlessly.  As my first off-road truck it seems to perform flawlessly.  Mine has the 3.4L V6 5VZ-FE engine with automatic transmission that has plenty of power off-road as well as it purrs quietly along the interstate taking me to and from work each day.  I like the 16 inch aluminum wheels and the big Bridgestone Rugged Trail T/A P265/70R16 tires.  I've read some complaints about the tires in other Epinion reviews but for my needs they have worked out well.  Having answered the question:  What are my needs?  I've found the tires to perform well off-road with 4WD engaged pulling me through some fairly deep mud holes.  Personally, I think the trick is physics and not so much the tires but they do perform much better than street tires.  Given that I spend a lot of time on the road, I also needed tires that were not too loud, or rough on the pavement (like some of the hard-core mud tires) and these have certainly fit the bill.  Although, the tires can be a bit precarious on the road during a downpour, as long as you drive safely, and not too aggressively, they will perform just fine.  This is one of the two trade-offs for for the dual-purpose tire.  The other is, of course, they don't grip like the jumbo mudders in the woods but as I said, the 4WD train compensates for most of this. 

The highlight of this truck is clearly the 4WD feature.  On one dark occasion in the woods, I drove-off into a ditch with only 2WD engaged.  With the pull of a lever, I was out and back on the trail again without ever having to get out of the truck.  This is a convenience afforded only to the trucks with an automatic transmission.  For those with a standard transmission, one would have to manually lock the hubs on each of the four wheels before engaging the 4WD.  On another occasion, I pulled a full size 1/2 ton truck out of a ditch when it ran off the trail.  The pulling power  of the Tacoma is astounding for what is technically considered a small truck.  

My opinion of the comfort is fairly simplistic.  It's a 4WD that is more comfortable than all of the other 4WD Toyota small trucks I've ridden in.  Many things contribute to the ride including the bucket seats, suspension, weight and slightly longer wheel base that you get w/the Xtra/Double cab models.  As part of the off-road package I got the Bilstein shocks which provide a good tight suspension but is not so rigid that it's uncomfortable for long traveling adventures.  The truck sits high so you must adhere to the rollover warnings stated in the owners manual.  It's not so much a concern when you're in the woods but caution does need to be taken on the roadways.  Other than that, it handles excellent in the woods and does just fine on the road.  The small foot-print enables you to maneuver the truck well through deer country and sometimes goes where full-size trucks can't go ... either because of their size or weight.   

The interior is nice but practical.  I did not want a luxurious truck for hunting.  It has everything I need and nothing I don't need, including a center console to throw "everything" in.  Mine came with the velour bucket seats, power package and white face gauges.  However, I fitted the seats with custom neoprene seat covers to protect them from the elements of hunting and fishing.  It also has a six speaker stereo system w/CD player that sounds clear and crisp at all decibels.  If you like it loud, it's plenty loud ... I've yet to turn it all the way up.  When the windows start to vibrate, that's loud enough for me.

The controls in the truck are conveniently located.  As I mentioned earlier the truck has a center console so the gear shift and 4WD lever is located in the center of the truck (technically it's on the floor).  The instrument panel is fairly well populated and there are only a couple of blank plugs that I've noticed.  It has all the basic features of a small truck instrument panel (speedometer, tachometer, gas gauge, clock, AC/Heat controls ... etc) and some extras like the rear differential lock button and the dual cigarette lighter ports for any external equipment you may want to extend 12V power.  There is also indicator lights for the following:  low fuel, engine check, seat belt reminder, 4WD, ECT PWR, O/D OFF, brake system warning, SRS warning light (the truck does have driver & passenger side airbags and if you place an infant in the passenger seat you have the option to turn off the airbag deployment on that side), low engine oil pressure and CRUISE.  My cruise control is an after-market that was added by the dealer so it doesn't utilize the light.  It works fine and I use it every day but if you want the truck to have a cruise control I would "make sure" it is factory installed.  In my case it was simply an oversight on my part.  As for the brakes and power steering, they work fine.  At first I noticed the antilock brakes had a tendency to stick after an emergency stop.  It wasn't anything major and it only happened if I were forced to slam-on the brakes.  When I would let up and begin moving again I could feel the pads break loose.  It occured during the first few months I owned the truck but it has not happened to me in the last year and the antilock brakes work as advertised.  The power steering is smooth and tight.  The power steering fluid ran a little low after a couple of years but I didn't find any leaks and believe that it was probably not filled up during the initial service.  I haven't had any problems with it.

The acceleration of the truck is hard and strong from a dead stop and I would consider it to be moderate at midrange.  Exceptional mid to high-end acceleration is something given up for the high torque, low end power that you get out of the truck.  The passing gear won't throw you back in the seat but it will easily get you around the traffic.  

As for gas mileage, it gets about 18 mpg.  If my memory serves me well, I believe Toyota's estimates were 17 to 19 mpg.  I have a friend who has an earlier model Tacoma from the 1990s and he raves about the gas mileage he gets with his 4 cylinder.  I think he gets around 28 mpg.  However, his does not have 4WD and so it's tough to try and factor what the loss might be attributed to.  

The payload (696 kg/1510 lbs.) is slightly less the the Pre Runner (761 kg/1695 lbs.) although I've yet to load it with more than it could handle.  Also, the off-road package takes some of the payload away.  I can only theorize that's because of the Bilstein shocks and possibly the aluminum wheels.

I will mention that my truck has developed a creak somewhere in the cab.  It's only heard when the temperature drops during the winter months and I think it's the bucket seats.  I noticed it during my second hunting season with the truck.  My hunting buddies all have their stories of creaks, squeaks and rattles in their trucks after a couple of seasons of hunting so I'm not too concerned with it.  However, I live in the South where the temperature averages between 50 and 60 degrees in the fall and winter and I would say that 90 percent of the time I don't hear the noise.

All in all, this is a good truck and I'm happy with my purchase.  For those who venture to the woods, you would be hard-pressed to find a tougher off-road vehicle to meet your needs.  I would also recommend going with the Xtra  or Double cab model because you will appreciate the extra dry storage space for your gear and/or your companions.  I like the convenience of the power package in mine as well.  The side mirrors, windows and door locks are all controlled with the press of a button.  Finally, I would recommend a Toyota Tacoma to anyone who needs, or simply prefers, a workhorse of a truck both on and off the road.
