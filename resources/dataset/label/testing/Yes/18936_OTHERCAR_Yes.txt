            This is my second Galant. My first, a 1989 model, was extremely reliable and the fit and finish was impeccable. My biggest problem with the car was it was somewhat under powered. I enjoyed that car so much that I decided to go with a Galant again but this time get the V6 engine.

With the V6, this car has plenty of power. Getting on the highway is a breeze. For it's size, the car is fairly nimble as well perhaps helped by the 16" tires standard on the V6. The extra power comes at a price. I average 17 - 20 mpg which I guess is not so terrible except the car it replaced (a 1995 Neon) averaged 35 mpg on the highway.

The outside styling of the car is beautiful. It has a small chrome grill in the front and a higher trunk line which gives it a sporty appearance. My car is silver and next to other silver cars, this card is VERY silver. It really stands out.

Inside, the car is fairly plush with wood trim. The seats are a solid gray material which looks nice now but I don't know how well it will hold up. The dashboard has the standard dials and gauges but the odometer and stereo display are extremely hard to read. They are common LCD displays but the contrast is so poor that I have a hard time reading the odometer and the stereo is all but unreadable. My car has the standard AM/FM/CD player. It is adequate but I don't think it would please a real stereo buff.

The ride is comfortable although a bit on the noisy side. It certainly is quieter than my old Neon (I think a jet engine would be) but it is not nearly as quiet as my Camry. The four speed automatic transmission is very smooth and shifts are usually unnoticeable. Spec wise, the Galant's interior is almost as big as a Camry but the back seat seems a bit smaller.

I have noticed a few things about fit and finish that I never saw on my old Galant. First, the trunk lid is not on level. The trunk closes without a problem but is noticeably crooked. The center console cover inside doesn't latch properly. A slight bump will pop it open. I have an annoying squeak when going over bumps as well. Nothing earth shattering so far but I had zero defects like this on the 1989. I am getting close to my 1000 mile mark so we'll see how the service department handles this.

From past experience, I always purchase an extended warranty as I tend to keep my cars a while. Mitsubishi's extended warranty is very expensive!! I almost did not buy it for that reason. I wound up with the 7/70000 zero deductible and it cost $1650. That is way too much. No other car I have ever purchased had a warranty that cost that much.

The good part though is that Mitsubishi was offering 5 year 1.9% financing. Compared to an 9% loan, this saved me a lot of money! It probably was the deciding factor.

All in all this is a very good car. It will please most buyers for sure. I hope to get many good years of service from it.

04/03/01 - UPDATE

I have had the car now about 10 weeks. Gas mileage has not improved and I am averaging around 17mpg around town and 20 if there is more highway. Another design flaw I have found is that there is no gear indicator on the dashboard. You have to look at the shift lever to see what gear you are in. In the winter with a heavy coat on, your view will be blocked and you can't see the gear indicator unless you move your coat out of the way. Finally, my car developed a squeak in the left rear end shortly after I got it. It took two trips to the shop to diagnose and the parts are still on back order. I am guessing it must be a weak spot on these cars if the parts are already not available.


04/05/01 - Update
The parts finally came in but when I brought in the car today, they said they had received a service bulletin and the squeak was caused by an unlubricated bushing. They did that lubrication and never installed the ordered parts but the squeak is now gone!
