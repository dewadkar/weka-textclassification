            I just bought the new Mitsubishi Montero limited, wow! Heated leather seats huge sunroof, all the luxury of an upscale car. The thing that is amazing is that this SUV has all that plus it is an excellent 4-wheel drive. Which I need just to get to my house, read the boondocks of southern Colorado. We traded in a 1990 Montero (had 220 K miles on it) for this on and it does even better off road. The four-wheel system has the usual 4 high switch on the fly but has a 4 low that you can lock the center differential. I used this yesterday to get up my driveway. The suspension soaks up pothole like the old one never did.
The 5 speed automatic, which almost all the suv's are is excellent, I can even shift it manually, which is nice if you are going down a steep grade and want to use the engine to slow you down some.

Can't recommend it enough.
