            Well, I Just Sold My 1989 Audi 100 while i still could and was in a rush to buy a replacement.  I stumbled upon a used 1990 740 turbo wagon for $995.  As I like to educate myself about whatever cars I buy, i read every review and internet snippet about this car that i could find.  I found absolutely no negatives except of course the usual high cost associated with european vehicle maintenence.  Anyway, I ended up paying $700 for an immaculate 1990 740 wagon with 193k miles, white with burgundy leather interior.  Everything functions perfectly, except the sunroof does not close with the electrical switch, so $15 will fix that.  The 160 horsepower generated by the 4 cylinder powerplant and turbo really make a heavy car feel light when you accelerate.  Almost no gas at all will have you coasting at 50  miles per hour.  The interior is very spacious and comfortable, in fact more comfy than my audi was.  There are only small details that I dislike about the car.  One is all of the hard plastic inside; lack of the usual interior ambience found in many luxury class cars.  The second dislike is the fact that on my car the seats are not electric.  Everything else the car has to offer more than makes up for these minor items.  I highly recommend this car to anyone who can't quite afford a mid 90's luxury class car, but wants quality, comfort, and power.
