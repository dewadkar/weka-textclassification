            First, I love this car with a passion.  Bought it new in 1988; had the engine rebuilt recently (now over 155,000+ miles).  If there were a new CRX, I might have bought another, but I am not getting rid of it for something else. 

I have had two accidents with this car - once rear-ended by a Toyota; another I was the filling in a four car pile-up.  I walked away from both with only minor stiffness lasting at most a month, and I am very middle-aged; I had the front rebuilt (cosmetic damage)(imagine, my insurance carrier said it was totaled - what do they know) and we are still on our merry way three years later.  

When, oh when, is Honda going to bring back a new version; it makes it (nearly) fun to commute to downtown D.C.  I have packed a rocking chair in the back and closed the hatch; or all my gear for a week's painting workshop with room for shopping along the way.  I know one day, I will have to cut the cord, but until then I am having fun.<br><br>
