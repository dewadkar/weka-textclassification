            I was in the market to get a digital camera to mainly take 640x480 pix for my website. I got a Polaroid 640 something, it was $150, no zoom and only took 640x480 pix. This was good for me for about 4 hrs till I realized I wanted more, and returned it.

So I started looking for a new camera and I narrowed it down to the Fuji Finepix 1400 and the Olympus 360L. They were both the same price but the Finepix had a 3x optical zoom witch made me get it <i>(the Olympus had a digital)</i>.

<b>Features about the Fuji Finepix 1400:</b>

<b>1. </b>The LCD panel is 1.6� with is kind of small compared to the more expensive models, but it still gets the job done. You can easily delete individual pictures or every picture at once. You can even lock in individual pictures to protect them from accidental deletion. I was very impressed. 

<b>2. </b>Has a USB port, allowing very quick picture transfers if you ever used to serial port to transfer pictures you be amazed how much faster and easer it is. It does not offer a serial download connection, so all you people out there with older computer and no USB port this camera is pretty much useless for you.

<b>3. </b>It does not have a video outlet, to hook up to your television for viewing pictures. I know some people complain about this but I have no need to view my pictures on a TV.

<b>4. </b>Has a sliding cover that protects the lens during off time. It is a tight and sturdy fit. 

<b>5. </b>There is a jack for an AC adapter, although I have not purchased one yet. This would be a useful feature only if you take lots of pictures in a small room, as the power cord would hinder your movement. Some people use the adapter while downloading pictures to their computers but with the USB port the transfer is so quick that hardly any battery power is used. 

<b>6. </b>Battery life is about normal for digital cameras. 

<b>7. </b>The Finepix has two settings, automatic and manual, and also a macro mode. You can control all kinds of technical features with manual mode, or just leave it on auto either way you still get good photos. The macro mode allows great close up pictures to be taken. <i>(as close as 10 centimeters to the object)</i> witch is a nice feature. 

<b>8. </b>There is a self-timer, which is nice, 10 seconds. You can use auto-zoom with this feature. 

<b>9. </b>There are several flash modes available: normal, no flash, extended exposure <i>(for night pictures)</i>, red eye, and a couple of other obscure settings. Red eye is not a problem with this camera. 

<b>10. </b>You can take pictures at 1024 / 780 or 640 / 480 resolutions. There is  �excellent�, �normal�, and �basic� detail level setting as well. All pictures are crisp, especially in excellent and normal detail levels.

I got mine at Wal-Mart for 299 it came with the standard stuff, the camera, 4mb card, software, etc. But also came with 4 rechargeable batteries and a charger.
