            Dateline 1996: 

I bought my 1995 (actually 1994.5) Pathfinder SEV6 4x4 to replace my 1991 Acura Integra LS, totalled when a kid in a souped-up Mustang broadsided me (that @*#&amp;%*#!). I originally looked at replacement Integras, but decided on an SUV for better ski trip driving.

I test drove almost all of the compact-ish SUVs out there at the time, with the exception of the Range Rover and Defender (but I did test drive a Discovery). Most, with the exception of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Nissan Pathfinder, had handling like mush. Reminded me of riding around in Dad's '68 Country Squire.

The Nissan proved to be the most like my beloved Integra; reliable, handled well around curves (no tip overs for me, thank you), and fuel-efficient. Plenty of cargo room for all my stuff.

I chose the manual transmission for two reasons: I like shifting for myself, and some posts on USENET mentioned problems with automatic transmissions on the 4x4 Pathfinders. Standard transmissions were said to be bulletproof, and so far (45,000 miles later) it's been fine.

The few things I've found lacking in the Pathfinder after three years are the following:

Lack of power: Every time I drive around in my friend's Explorer, I think, &quot;Damn! I could have had a V8&quot;! The '95 Pathfinder's V6 is ok, but could use a bit more oomph. I hear the newer versions have a stronger engine.

Old-style sunroof: The power moonroof wasn't available on Pathfinders until the new redesign in 1996. So, to get that open air motoring thing, you've got to physically remove that glass window from up above your head. At least it's Y2K compliant.

No cover for cargo area: Other SUV's have those windowshade-like roll up thingys to cover your stuff back there. Heck, even cheapo hatchbacks have them. Why didn't the Pathfinder have one? Sheesh.

Overall, though, I'm very happy with my Pathfinder. Great SUV--does everything I wanted.<br><br>
