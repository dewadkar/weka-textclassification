            My wife brought a new 1999 camry into our family a year ago. Although I seldom drive it, I am very comfortable as the passenger. I've had Toyotas since 1970 when my first car was a hand me down 1967 Toyota Corona. Now that was a bit of a problem, especially when the placement of the distributor caused the points to get wet whenever it rained. 

They have come a long way since 67. My next car was a Dodge Van ~ lots of fun but lots of mechanical problems. I got a 1977 longbed truck that made me love Toyota again. A new longbed in 1984 and a trade in to a Celica in 1990. 107,000 miles later and still find Toyota pretty problem free. <br><br>
