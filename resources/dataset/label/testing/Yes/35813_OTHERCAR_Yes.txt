            I purchased my 1993 Saturn Sl-1 new in 1993, and have been in love 
with it ever since then! My car currently has 113,000 miles on it, 
and it continues to perform well.  As far as maintenance is concerned, 
I change the oil and filter every 3,000 miles. The only repair the car
has needed has been to replace an engine fan.  This car isn't the 
best when traveling through mountain terrain, it has a little problem
climbing steep hills. 

The customer service/repair departments of Saturn that I've worked with has been remarkable!  I cannot recall any past experience with any other
dealerships in which I have felt so comfortable, and had so much trust in.

The gas mileage is wonderful! The maintenance costs are minimal! It's 
just a great little car!<br><br>
