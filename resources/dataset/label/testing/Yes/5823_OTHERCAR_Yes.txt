            I bought this product a few weeks ago. I hadn't opened it for a while because I had been so busy with work. Then I was invited to a party and decided to use it so I could put it on my computer and send it to other family. I was surprised at how easy it was to take pictures. The LCD monitor, as it says, has the ability to display 4, 9, or 16 images at once, which made it very simple to choose the pictures I wanted to keep or delete. Shooting pictures was the easiest, without having to wait. After I put the pictures on my computer and edited them, printing them out was quick,and the results were excellent. The colors were vivid, and graphics were precise. I give it 2 thumbs up!<br><br>
