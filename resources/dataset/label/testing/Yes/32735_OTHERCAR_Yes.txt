            When it comes to 'Bang for the Buck' nothing beats the Chevy Camaro.  If you enjoy driving and you don't have a lot of money to spend, then buy this car.  However, if you have a family, or more than one friend, then you're better off buying something else.

PROS:

Price-I bought my car for around $20,000.  I have seen brand new, bare bones Camaros for sale for $14,000.  Make sure you get the following options: power locks, power windows, power driver's seat, rear-window defrost, AC, CD, and anti-lock brakes.

Power-I bought the 200hp V-6 because I wanted to save a little money.  The 200hp was good for a few months but, pretty soon I was itching for more.  If you have the extra $4,000 get the 305hp V-8.

Protection-I got into an accident with my previous 1995 Camaro.  I was only doing about 35mph at the time.  The front-end absorbed most of the impact.  The air-bag and seatbelt did a great job of keeping my 240lbs. body restrained.  The car was a write-off but I walked away with no injuries.

Styling-People really love the look of my car.  They always want to know what color it is.  I tell them that it is 'blue'.  They are not satisfied with this answer so I looked it up on the GM web-site.  The official color is 'navy blue metallic'.  I must admit that it does look pretty nice when it is clean.  Also, the chrome wheels add to it's appearance.  However, I did not buy this car for it's appearance.  I bought it for it's performance.  If you are concerned about appearance, just do what I do.  Go to your local Mercedes dealership and buy one of their insignias.  Get out your drill and mount that thing on the hood of your car.  Most people won't know the difference.

CONS:

Back Seats-I have been able to comfortably fit average size people into the back seat for short trips.  However, I would not like to sit back there for an extended amount of time.  This may actually be an asset, as I am never asked to drive when my co-workers and I go out to lunch.

Trunk Room-What trunk room?  Hit men will be disappointed, as I was only able to squeeze one dead body into the tiny space behind the rear wheels.

Handling-The rear-end has a tendency to break loose.  After you master it you can have a lot of fun.  However, a real problem develops when it rains.  Showing any aggressiveness in a corner will send the car into a spin.

Gas Mileage-I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting about 15 mpg.  I get closer to 25 mpg on the highway.

SECRET:

Power-Chevrolet has been increasing the power of their V-8 engine and has not been telling anyone.  A few auto magazines have learned this and have been measuring the true horsepower of these engines.  They estimate that the 305hp rated engine is actually putting out closer to 330hp.  This only applies to the newer versions (2000 model).<br><br>
