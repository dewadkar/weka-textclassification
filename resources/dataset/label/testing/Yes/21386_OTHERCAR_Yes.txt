            I wanted a dependable car that would last a long time - I have an 11 year old son and I want him to have this car when he gets his license in 6 years - so safety was also a concern of mine.  I bought the 1999 Camry as my parents have one from the early 1980's, and it is still going strong.

It is a great family car and it rides nice.  The major reason I decided to write this, however, is because the other day, I was rear ended in the back.  The small truck behind me must have been doing at least 40 mph and on impact, it sounded (and felt) like there would be some damage to my bumper.  Lo and behold, when I got out to check on the damage, it was so minimal, that I'm not even going to bother getting my bumper repaired.

This experience has left me with confidence in the Camry, but truthfully, the way I drive, I don't think the car will last until my son is 17!<br><br>
