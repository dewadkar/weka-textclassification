            Reviewers universally seem obliged to mention, and even trash, the late Z3, which the Z4 replaced. Having owned two Z3s, a 1996 1.9 and a 2000 2.8, I don't feel the need to compare the two. While the the Z4 did supersede the Z3, the two cars only share the "Z" in front of their model name. The Z3 was a fun car, with a good design, but it was built out of the BMW parts bin on a chassis, that, in 1996, was already some ten years old.

The Z4 is an all new design from the chassis to rear-glass top, and its readily apparent. The only hold-over is the engine, which are the same employed on the last Z3 models. The interior has Z8 overtones, with an understated sweeping dash, fitted with graphite-looking plastic trim, real aluminum trim, or wood, depending on the model and options you select. The controls are very simple and intuitive. If you are looking for James Bond gadgets, they are decidedly absent, although you can order a cool-looking DVD based Navigation system that pops out of the dash.

There are some disappointments, though minor, with the components used inside. Most notably are the seats. They are fairly thin and poorly bolstered. This is especially noticeable when making hard turns, as you tend to slide around just a bit.

The other weak spot of the interior is the radio/CD player. Had BMW put in a truly top notch unit, I wouldn't mind that the radio is a non-standard size and can't be fitted with an aftermarket unit. What BMW did, though, is put in a radio, that might have been cutting-edge technology in 1990. In 2003, its rather feature poor. For example, it doesn't support CD-Text, so you only see track numbers, which is a pain if you put in the optional CD changer. Also, it doesn't support MP3-CDs.

Of course BMWs are known for their driving prowess, and that is where the Z4 truly shines. Its no slouch in the 0-60 slot at 0-60 in 6 sec (3.0 model) but its handling is what separates it from the common straight-line behemoth. Any car company can put a big engine in a car, but it takes real engineering to get a car to handle the way the Z4 does. You'll think you are driving on rails. And, when it comes to braking, it does so on command. I'd say it stops on a dime, but a dime is too big an object. The brakes are that good.

At $33,000 the Z4 would be a bargain, but like most things in life, there is a catch. You probably don't want a base Z4. For starters, it comes with 16" wheels, which are a tad too small for the larger body. You'll notice big gaps in the wheel well, which don't look too sharp. 

Next, you'll want a power top. I bought mine with the manual top, because I've always had manual tops. I regret the choice this time. The Z4 top doesn't just drop down like most manuals. It takes work and muscle to get the top down (though it comes up easily). I find it annoying that I can't put the top down at a stop light like I'm accustom to doing. Get the power top.

Last, if you love to drive (and if you don't the Z4 isn't for you anyway) you'll want the sport package. It gives you bigger wheels, a tighter suspension, AND the sport button. This is a must have, especially if you get the Steptronic transmission. Push this button and watch the Z4 fly. It doesn't make the car faster, but, rather, helps the car shift faster. I would also recommend Xenon headlights.

There are also some options you may want to leave off. The NAV is a cool toy, but it is a toy. In big cities its pretty useless, and it will routinely take you out of the way to get to your destination. It also has an annoying "nag" screen each time you turn your car on and you must "accept" the screen before using it. For $1800, there are better ways to spend your money. 

The convenience package is also a waste of money, for what BMW charges. You do get storage nets, which are nice, since the Z4 has little storage space, but the $200 trunk organizer is a good alternative. The other items in the package: the rain sensing wipers, the headlight cleaners, and the auto a/c will not be missed if you don't have them. The manual a/c is more than adequate, and requires few adjustments while driving.


Once you have all your options selected the MSRP will get to the high 30s, or, if you select the 3.0, the mid 40s. Dealers were giving discounts of $1500-2000 during this past winter, but now that spring is near, those discounts may be gone now. Do try to deal though, and don't be afraid to shop around, even if that means going to another nearby city or state. Every BMW dealership is different. Some can be jerky, and others very good to deal with. If you do end up paying MSRP make sure you bargain for free installation of a CD changer, etc. And, don't forget to make sure they toss in the car mats.
