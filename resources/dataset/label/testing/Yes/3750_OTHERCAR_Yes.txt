            We bought our Chevrolet Silverado because we knew it would stand up to the use we would be giving it.  It's a good solid truck with lots of luxury appeal as well.  We also intend to use our Silverado to pull a camper for weekend fishing trips and summer vacations.

We love the third door feature on our Silverado extended-cab.  With a teenage son *on board* with us a lot of the time, it provides that extra space we need.  (And it sure doesn't hurt when Mom decides to go shopping!)

Besides the fact that we just love to drive a truck rather than a car for the visibility factor, our Silverado is our vehicle of choice for long trips as well as short.  It provides the elbow and leg room needed for optimum comfort for all and those lumbar seats are terrific.

I don't know of anyone who wouldn't love and enjoy a Silverado!<br><br>
