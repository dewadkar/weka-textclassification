            I've owned my 2000 Grand Am GT Coupe for a month.  I love it as much now as I did the day I drove it off the lot.  I've owned many different cars, most recently a '98 Buick Regal GS and a '96 Olds Cutlass Supreme Coupe, but none of them were as fun to drive as my Grand Am.  The Buick had more horsepower and torque, thanks to a supercharger, but it didn't handle like the Pontiac and it weighed considerably more.  The Olds was a beautiful car, but was down on power.  I looked at several different makes, including Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Oldsmobile, but no car offered the aggressive styling, performance and value of the Grand Am.  I was also extremely pleased with the service I received from the dealership.  

This car is built for a person who loves to drive.  It will launch off the line, pass and merge into traffic with ease, and hug a curve like no car I've driven.  It does have a horrendous blind spot that takes getting used to.  I've learned to look through the headrest, cross my fingers an hold my breath when I need to change lanes.  I don't know if this is as much of an issue on the 4-door models.  It also has a much tighter turning radius than any GM car I've driven in recent years.  I have also been impressed with how quiet the cabin is.  All the gauges and controls are intuitive and clear, and the red backlighting at night is fantastic.  

If I could change anything on the car, I'd improve the blind spot and make the sunroof recess into the roof of the car instead of rising above the roof line.  I'd also make the hood a little easier to open.

This car was not built for someone who cares only about getting from one place to another as inconspicuously as possible.  This car is for those of us who love to hang it out in a curve, lay in the throttle and hear the exhaust hum and can enjoy the drive as much or more than the destination.<br><br>
