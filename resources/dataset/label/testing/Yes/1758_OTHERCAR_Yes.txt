            After 140,000 miles, my Mazda finally showing sign of old age.  The door squeaks when close and the clutch makes noises when step on.  The worse part is the engine began to burn oil in a much faster rate.  I have to add a quart of oil every 1000 miles.  But other than these, the car still drives fine in all weathers.

The best thing about this car is the fact that it is trouble free.  I bought this car almost 4 years ago and drove more than 70,000 miles.  It broke down only once about a year ago and it was my fault.  The distributor was still the original after 120,000 miles and it just stops working.  I bought a new one for $150 and that was it.  I also have to spend $200 on the dashboard light.  The $350 is the only money I spend other than the routine maintenance such as oil changes, brake service and new tires etc.  Something else I like very much is the fact that the car starts as soon as I turn the ignition.  Even in the subzero temperature, it starts without any hesitation.  For a long time used car owner (4 cars in 10 years, exclude 626), I had my shares of problem cars.  This is so far the best car I had.
In addition to low maintenance, I save a lot of money on gas.  I get 30 mpg on average, and best I got was 35.  I think it is excellent for a car this size (5 speed helps too).  

I am sure most people want a reliable car, but many would like a car with a lot feature as well.  Mazda 626 has it all.  Power window, door, antenna, and lock.  It also has keyless entry and moonroof.  All for less than $8000 (I got a really good deal).  

What about handling then?  Well, it listens to me.  I tell it where to go and it responds instantly without any delay or hesitation.  And it doesn�t complain with shakes and vibrations while I am driving.  I couldn�t ask for a better car.  However, it is getting old and one day I will have to let it go.  I hope my next car will be just as good as my Mazda.

BTW, if you decide to buy a Mazda, get a stick shift.  There are a lot of complaint about their auto transmission.
