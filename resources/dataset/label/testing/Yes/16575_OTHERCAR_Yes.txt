            Now that I've spent some time with my recently purchased 1997 328i, I was eager to write a review on this fine automobile.  

I decided to purchase this car based on the quality reputation of BMW, positive things that I've read and heard about the car, and performance.  After test driving the car, I was sold.  

The car handles fantastically.  The ride is very compliant, I feel that a perfect balance has been struck between handling and ride compliance.  Considering this cars handling ability, I was actually surprised at how smooth the ride was.  The acceleration is very good, and the brakes are wonderful.  

The build quality of the car is excellent.  The car is amazingly solid, and this can be felt from behind the wheel.  I've never driven a car that has felt this solid, this includes my Lexus ES300 and my Sister's Cadillac SLS.  The interior of the car is well laid out and a little roomier than it appears from the outside.  The location of the window controls were a little strange to me (they're on the center console), but are easy to get used to.  

This is a true driver's car.  There is something to be said about German engineering.  Instead of building a car to have the most gimmicks or the biggest spoiler, they built a car that feels perfectly balanced, and responds to your driving inputs instantly.  It almost feels as if the car knows what you are going to do before you do it.  The driver feels totally connected to the car while behind the wheel.  

The car was a BMW certified pre-owned model, and came with an excellent warranty up to 100,000 miles or 6 years from the original in-service date.  

People may say that BMW's are overpriced, and you'll get more for your money with a different luxury car.....but believe me, you won't get the same feeling behind the wheel of those other cars.  If you love to drive, this car is for you.
