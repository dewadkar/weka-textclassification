            I have a 97 M3 that I've owned for a year. (37K Miles now).
The first few weeks you own this car, it messes with your head. Every time you drive it, you realize more and more just how incredible the car handles. 
In May '99 I took it in an autocross and had the opportunity to drive it legally at 138mph. The car can run at that speed all day, and it's extremely smooth. 
The &quot;steering feel&quot; is so good, you can almost read the writing on manhole covers when you drive over them. The car handles so well, you look forward to going around corners.
From 35mph to zero, the car emergency stops in about 2 car lengths. The problem with this is that you'll get stopped but the car behind you won't. :-(
&quot;Why did you buy this vehicle?&quot;
Handling and performance...
&quot;What do you love about this vehicle?&quot;
Handling and performance...
&quot;What do you hate about this vehicle?&quot;
The wheel rims get black from brake pad residue. (Sorry, that's all I could think of)
&quot;What is it like to drive this vehicle?&quot;
Absolutely incredible, every time you get behind the wheel.
&quot;Who should buy this vehicle?&quot;
If you love to drive and you can afford the car, there is no other car that compares!<br><br>
