            I recently had a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder SE as a rental car, for a couple of weeks, and I have the following observations:

Good Things:
- Powerful: the SE has 250 horsepower in the 2001 model (and part of 2000 model).  Much more powerful than my similarly equipped Ford Explorer.
- Fairly roomy.  Although the Pathfinder will get bigger in 2002, to compete with the Ford Expedition/Chevy Tahoe, for now, it is still a midsided SUV, with appropriate storage capability.
- Fun and cool.  Drives like a car, not like a truck.  Looks good on the highway and in the parking lot.

Could be Better:
- Gas mileage.  This thing consumes more gas than my Explorer, which accounts for the bigger engine.
- Will be replaced with a different, bigger model in another year.  This will only be a downside for some.
- Some of the components could be better on the inside.  For example, the model I drove had a CD changer, which was a 6 disc in dash unit.  While this was ok, it was a little slow, and not as nice as the 1 disc in dash, plus changer in another part of the vehicle.  I'd prefer just a single CD over the one supplied.
- Somewhat expensive, but competes fairly well in the middle-level SUV market.

Overall, I really like it, but I'm not sure I would buy one.<br><br>
