            I didn't want one but my girlfriend wanted it so. . . I am now the proud owner of a Toyota Highlander (all-wheel drive, V-6, all options).

I'm not a big fan of SUVs but I can live with the Highlander which is saying a lot.  It's clearly going to be a home run for Toyota.

The Good:  The Highlander has a very car-like ride (because it's based on a car, not a pickup).  It handles quite well for a tallish vehicle (and feels stable).  It has great pick-up (with the V-6).  It has good visibility (including the normally blind spot over the driver's right shoulder -- I've found with some other SUVs that the beltline of the car is so high that one cannot see the roof of a car immediately adjacent -- I know that's what the mirrors are for but I like to be able to double check with my own eyes before changing lanes).  It has the usual good stuff that comes with a Toyota (Well built, nice materials, presumably high reliability, reasonably logical controls).

The Bad:  The storage is remarkably bad.  There is a little bin on the dash near the driver's left knee.  It's a great storage spot but the space itself is so deep that it's hard to figure out what to put there.  Change is out of the question.  Maybe a cell phone?  Pens?  It's a weird space.  A pair of drawers on top of each other might have been better.  The center console (optional) suffers from the same problem -- it's way too deep.  A flip up tray or something to divide the space would be a great improvement.  The ashtray is really far away and awkward to reach and so isn't a great storage space either.  The door storage and seatback storage is great (but that's pretty much expected in a Toyota).

More Bad (but less so):  Another reviewer pointed out that it's hard to buy one option alone because most of the Highlanders seem to have been shipped with packages.  I agree (and it's why I ended up with a roof rack and spoiler among other unwanted options).

Not so Bad (personal taste):  I don't like the headlights.
