            I&#146ll start this review by telling you that this is from an amateur (at best) and will be written from that perspective.  I&#146ll leave the technical specs, etc. to others who are better suited to communicate that type of information.  

I have two young children and this was my primary reason in researching and eventually getting a new camera.  I am the kind of person who does a fair amount of research for most if not all of my purchases and this purchase was no exception.  I have owned a point and shoot Fuji camera for many years and it served me well.  Some friends have touted the benefits of going digital for quite some time and I&#146ve held off purchasing because I&#146m the kind of person who doesn&#146t need to get the &#147latest and greatest&#148.  

As I stated above I wanted to get a better camera primarily to capture some shots of my children as they grow up.  A major benefit attributed to digital cameras, and I&#146ve heard this over and over again, is &#147When you have a digital camera you take so many more pictures!&#148  Let me tell you, this is very true.  With a regular film camera, you take shoot a roll of 24 exposures and maybe you&#146re real pleased with 3 or 4 of them.  The other 20+ pictures you paid good money for film and developing don&#146t seem to be worth the cost.  I would hesitate to just shoot away because of the perceived lack of value in the majority of the pictures I would get.  That hesitation is gone with a digital camera and you end up with many more quality shots at the end of the day because you aren&#146t concerned about shooting away!  I know this isn&#146t germaine to a review of this unit but is an important aspect in deciding to get a digital camera.

Now on to the Olympus C5050Z&#133..what a great camera!!!  As mentioned before I was a point and shoot person for many years.  I never considered myself an avid photographer whatsoever.  In addition to getting a camera to record my children I decided that I would get a camera I could grow into and add photography as a hobby.  This is the perfect choice if the preceding sentence describes you as well.  I purchased this camera in June 2003 and have now taken hundreds (if not thousands) of shots of my family and scenery both here at home and on vacations.  I have obtained some really great shots and have begun a collection of photos I will treasure the rest of my life.  

I would say that for a few weeks before my final decision and for a few weeks afterwards I spent a combined total of maybe 40 hours reading photography sites (some of that time was finding sites in the first place, so here&#146s a link (be sure to cut and paste these links to your browser) which provides a gateway to many good sites&#133 "http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1008&message=4536807" ) learning about such things as sharpness, saturation, contrast, aperture settings (good link discussing this is "http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1018&message=2081983" , shutter speeds, flash intensity, ISO settings, macrophotography, etc.  If this sounds a bit daunting to you, don&#146t let it.  Although I have a basic understanding of most of these items, I usually change very little with my C5050 since I&#146ve learned about what those items are and have set my camera to my likings.   One really nice feature with this camera is the &#147My Mode&#148 option.  With this feature you can program a variety of settings within a &#147Mode&#148 and there are 8 modes you can set to your fancy depending on shooting requirements.  Remember, I was a point and shooter and for the most part I still am.  I have set all 8 modes mostly based on recommendations of Steve Wrotniak http://www.wrotniak.net/photo/c5050/c5050-rev.html.  Of those 8 &#147My Mode&#148 settings, I find myself in Mode 1 about 98% of the time.  I leave the camera in that &#147My Mode&#148 1 and occasionally make minor adjustments from there (maybe a slow flash instead of auto flash to mitigate the reflection of the flash back at me in the picture&#133did that a bit this past week).

My research led me to a final two choices of the C5050Z and the C740/750 UZ, both by Olympus.  The main reason I ended up with the C5050Z was the general consensus feeling that the lens on the C5050Z (and probably some other components) provided the C5050Z with an edge in picture quality, including skin tones, etc.  With the perceived edge in picture quality going towards the C5050Z, that&#146s the way I went.  I really liked the 10X optical zoom of the C740/750 which would allow you to bring a subject closer, but picture quality won the day.  Maybe someday I will get C750UZ as well&#133.I read on www.dpreview.com (a great site to read the user forums and see examples of pictures taken with different digital cameras) a husband (photographer) and wife (golfer) were discussing their respective hobbies.  The wife complained to her husband, who had just purchased a C750UZ, that he shouldn&#146t need another camera since he already had two.  He replied to her &#147How many golf clubs do you have?&#148.  She replied back, &#147I have one set&#148.  His response&#133&#148Maybe you call it a set, but I believe you have 14 clubs, each does something different&#133.Same with my cameras, they each do something different!&#148.  I thought that was kind of funny and also true.  You have to decide what you are going to do with your camera before you can make the best decision.  If you want to primarily take shots of your kids playing soccer, you may need that 10X optical zoom. 

Bottom line&#133I love this camera.  I did read another reviewer who mentioned something about this being overkill.  Again, if you have no interest in learning a little about photography, go with a lower end camera.  As long as you&#146re not going to print larger pictures (say greater than 5 X 7) you should be fine with a 3 megapixel camera.  This camera is a 5 megapixel camera which reminds me of another point.  I was reading a discussion about picture quality choices within the camera.  Basically you have RAW, TIFF, SHQ and HQ in order of descending quality.  The first few generate large file sizes for each picture and I believe are intended for greater post production processing (digital darkroom stuff with programs like Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Microsoft Digital ImagePro) and are probably for more advanced users.  I stick with SHQ for my shots.  I initially shot in HQ to allow more pictures on my XD Card and Compact Flash Card (these items are reusable digital film and act like hard drives when you hook them up to your computer.  The main difference, aside from file size, is quality of captured image.  The larger file size you allow the camera to take, the less detail the camera omits to comply with that file size.  The better the detail, the better a larger size print will look.  His point was you never know when you will get that great shot and why take the chance?  I was trying to get as many pictures to fit on my cards.  The reality is that with my 256 megabyte cards I can fit plenty (about 70 on each) in SHQ mode and will still be able to, if I choose, print an 8 X 11, 11 X 14 or even a 20 X 30 sized print in great quality.  

I mentioned above about the XD card and Compact Flash card.  This camera has two bays into which you can simultaneously have two different cards of different type.  I ended up choosing a 256 XD card I bought from Best Buy for $89 after rebate and a Transcend 256 Compact Flash card I purchased, no hassle, from www.newegg.com  Each card holds about 70 pictures on each and I have them in the camera at the same time, so I&#146ve got 140 shots I can save&#133.remember I can take probably 200 &#150 300 to get to 140 saved shots because I take the same shot over a few times and save only the shot I like.  140 saved shots is almost 6 rolls of 24 exposure film and keeping in mind I take many more shots than 140 that I eventually save it&#146s like 10+ rolls of film in my camera at once!  I&#146ve never come close to getting to 140 shots saved before I download to my computer anyway, so for me the 256 meg cards (times two of them) is more than I need.

Another great feature of this camera (and this is not true of all Olympus cameras or other manufacturers for that matter) is that it will take standard AA batteries versus proprietary batteries.  Proprietary batteries means that when you are on the road on vacation and you&#146re batteries go dead and you didn&#146t bring your charger you&#146re in a bit of trouble.  With the C5050Z you can just buy 4 standard AA batteries or CR-V3 batteries (two of those) and you are back in business.  I keep two CR-V3s in my bag (see bag discussion below) and I&#146m safe!  By the way, battery life with the provided rechargeable Lithium Ion 1700 batteries is adequate.  I can probably take about 100 shots with the LCD screen on (which I recommend because the viewfinder will not produce the final shot because of parallax error, particularly on subjects close to the camera&#133the LCD screen is the way the final shot looks on the computer or printed out&#133).  The camera comes with a battery charger for those Lithium Ion batteries and takes about 9 hours to charge them up.  You will also receive a remote control for this camera which I have yet to use.  The camera does come with a 32M XD card, but I highly recommend you purchase larger capacity cards right away&#133see above discussion for what I did.

Next I&#146ll mention that you should purchase a card reader.  The best I&#146ve found out there for my purposes is the Lexar Media 6 in 1 reader&#133.It can handle many types of &#147digital film&#148 including my XD and Compact Flash cards and is USB 2.0 which means transfer speed is pretty quick.  I bought mine from Dell, cost $32&#133.link is http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=A0107419&c=us&l=en&cs=19&category_id=4325&page=external 

Because you are considering purchasing a digital camera I&#146ll discuss securing your images for a bit.  If you don&#146t already have a backup external (or internal) hard drive, get one.  If you transfer your precious images to your computer and that hard drive crashes, guess what?  You are in big trouble.  Back up to the external hard drive regularly.  In addition, I recommend purchasing space at an internet site such as www.imageevent.com which I&#146ve used and have really enjoyed.  Other sites include www.pbase.com and a host of others.  In addition to providing another backup of your photos in case of disaster (what if you&#146re house burned down taking out your computer and your external drive, heaven forbid) you now have a way to easily share your photos.  Cost is about $25 a year for my deal at ImageEvent and is for 1,500 images (a bunch in my book) for that one year.  

I also needed to buy a case for the camera.  One which was recommended to me and I eventually went with is the LowePro D Res 25 AW.  This fits the camera nice and snug and has room for extra batteries and a little pocket for extra XD cards, etc.  I bought it for $26 at Ritz Photo&#133.Here&#146s the link&#133www.lowepro.com/pages/series/dres/dres25.html 

You have probably figured out by now that the cost of your digital camera is just the start.  New digital media (XD, Compact Flash, etc.), card reader, camera case, etc. requires an extra few hundred dollars or so.  Well worth it since the pictures I&#146ve taken are&#133..yep, priceless!

Bottom line is that I would buy this camera again in a heart beat.  I did hear that the C5060Z is just being released so be sure to check that out and see if the enhancements make sense for you.
