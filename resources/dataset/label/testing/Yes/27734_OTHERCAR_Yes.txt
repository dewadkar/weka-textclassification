            I am long time satisfied satisfied owner of the Canon ELPH (AFS). I've also had two digital camera's, the original Apple Quicktake and and Olympus DL340. The Apple was awful, the Olympus at 1.3 megapixels was dream at the time, but 8x10's were too fuzzy. Then on a trip to Singapore last week I saw a Canon IXUS (Digital Elph in USA). Finally a digital camera that outwardly was near identical to my favorite camera (The AFS Film Elph) and promised to deliver true film quality. This camera in the hand and to the eye just screams: QUALITY. It was like the first time I held a Glock, a special moment between man and machine.

At 2.1 megapixels it has all the definition one requires unless one is a serious student of photography or a professional. People who just need to take pictures will find the Digital ELPH all the camera they need. 

Easy to carry, it straps to the belt like the film ELPH. Turn the camera on and it's point and shoot right out of the box, no need to read the directions.

For advanced use you have all normal flash modes, Infinity/Macro setting, self-timer, continuous shooting, exposure compensation, white balance and image quality settings. The zoom control rotates around the shutter button, very intuitive. The LCD screen is sharp and hard to view in sunlight.

The best feature of this camera is how it processes the images. No more serial connection or using a FlashCard, just plug the USB connector into the camera and the Canon ZoomBrowser EX software pops up. Downloading the images via the USB port is very, very fast. Images are retained on the Compact Flash and easily erased from the camera or via the software.

I can't praise the ZoomBrowser software enough. It has all the usual controls for adjusting the picture and cropping, but when you are done with that - then comes the magic. You just drag and drop the pictures into a frame, they arrange themselves automatically (you can manually move them too), add a title or text, Click on print, and you get a great 8x10. I can safely say, except for extraordinary circumstances, my Photoshop no longer has any practical value to me. ZoomBrowser does it all to include easy email of photos and audio annotation.

A note on the battery. It's slim rechargeable battery (with apparently long life, I have not tested it fully yet). I like what the battery does for keeping the camera slim. The downside comes if you run out of juice, you can't just pop some AA's in.

If you are looking for an easy to use, high quality digital camera that is easy to carry and offers a superb interface with your PC, then I  highly recommend the Digital ELPH.
