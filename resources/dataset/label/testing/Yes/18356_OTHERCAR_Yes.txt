            When my dad was assigned to work in France for aircraft conglomerate back in 1995, he was given a decent payroll and a house, but it didn��t include a car though.  Then he decided to go for a Lexus, since it��s basically a Toyota.  Since Lexus is really just the upscale division of Toyota Motors, he can assure that it carries the same reliability and the same peace of mind that Toyota has for their vehicles.  Then he took a stroll around and he found the perfect Lexus for his executive position.  Even with a used Toyota, we can still expect it to last for 15 years and beyond after the product is made.  At about $40000, the LS 400 was really a great value compared to a similarly equipped Mercedes Benz S-Class or even a BMW 7-series.

<b> Experience </b>

After about 6 years of driving, there was minimal breakdown, no malfunctions in the audio and air conditioning.  Even if my dad carried his country club buddies to the golf club or colleagues to the corporate ball, the back seat passengers didn��t really complain about the rear seat.  With the adjustable steering column and seat, it provides the driver to adjust their ideal driving position without taking too much time figuring out the optimal comfort.  With the capability to store 2 positions for the driver, it makes it even more versatile by storing the settings for the seat, the shoulder belt height and the steering column, in case the seat, shoulder belt height and the steering column was tampered.

The control panel for the stereo and the climate control had large and legible buttons for easy control without taking your eyes off the road.  Even the 6 Disc CD Changer mounted in the boot was easy to control from the stereo.  With the controls well spread out, not cluttered like the BMW or Mercedes Benz; it allows people to perceive that the LS 400 has excellent ergonomics.  However the seat warmer switches are kind of mounted low for easy reach.

The materials, especially the leather and wood were excellent indeed for a Japanese automobile.  The materials were up to European standards like the Mercedes Benz has for their wood and leather, but not as warming like the Jaguar��s.  The vehicle itself was very serene and quiet, which is what we really expect from upscale luxury cars.  The paint was as smooth as the Mercedes Benz again, which is again up to European standards in terms of finish.

The resale value is also a big plus for the LS 400, because of its reliability.  It also means that the LS 400 has been sold in quite large amounts and it has proven itself to be a leader in its league for excellence.

But don��t expect BMW handling for the LS 400 though, the suspension was very even and it absorbed the bumps very well and the body tends to lean under tight cornering.

The only complaint that my dad has with the LS 400 is the small boot (trunk).  He can only hold 1 duffel bag, his own set of golf clubs and 2 briefcases in a 13.0 cubic foot trunk. 

<b> Status Today </b>

About 16 months ago, tragedy struck to my dad��s LS 400.  It was stolen due to theft.  However his insurance company provided the funds from the insurance holdings and he has decided to go for a different car this time as he continues to work in France.  Even though with his Lexus stolen, he will continue to recommend the LS 400 to anyone who wants a BMW or Mercedes Benz alternative.
