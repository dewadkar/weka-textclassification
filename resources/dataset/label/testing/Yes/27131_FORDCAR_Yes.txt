             I have wanted a full-sized Bronco since 1988. In 1999, I came close, purchasing a cheaper, and reliable Bronco II. That truck had 187,000 miles and still ran well, when I sold it, with a 177, V-6. That truck gave me confidence that coming back to a 302, V-8  once more would be just as reliable, only in a bigger truck. Finally, in 2003, I got one of these great beasts, although not in as great of shape as I would have liked. 

1. I enjoy the relative ease of doing back-yard maintenance, due to space in the engine bay, for spark plug changes, and so forth. Many of my parts are still original, as of 97,000 miles and 10 years!

2. I also like the styling for the '92-'96 models, which unfortunately were the last of a great breed of truck. The Bronco of these later years represents class, toughness, and style, which is so suited for us two-door vehicle lovers. The body is graceful, yet intimidatingly large. The chrome is stoic and solid. The lights are bright and commanding, and the interior first-rate for a traveler, like myself.

3. The Bronco is good in all weather and all soil conditions, as I have used them in my ranger profession, where they have given me few problem, with all the different types of use they saw! From sand to snow, from traffic enforcement to transporting park visitors, the Bronc did well. I have used many kinds of trucks in my work, and I always liked the Bronc the best of the batch. 

4. The space in the truck is adequate for multiple uses, especially for travels, moving, or groceries. Plus, I can keep my tools and emergency road equipment in the back, and still have room for other items. The clearance off the ground helps in bad weather as well as with off-road hazards. The engine bay is so well suited for most maintenance work.

5. The engine is what breeds the best of the rest of this truck. I have 97,000 miles on my rigg, and I have seen enough Broncos in ads when I was shopping for one, which had way over 120,000 miles, with the 302 and 351 engine. That says much, even with the abuse of the less respectful owners who use these truck. Access to plugs, hoses, belts, and spark plugs is very reasonable. With vigilance of regular maintenance I have all ready made three long trips with this truck, not knowing it prior history of its first 10 years. It ran strong, and with my attention to detail, and some  fresh parts, this truck should actually run better over time, than when it was new, with additions like a K. & N. filter,  high performance plugs, new computer regulator chip, new exhaust system, and good old regular oil changes. 

A. Of the few short-comings, I am not too crazy about the front suspension, as it relates to alignment issues. Buying this rigg used, it will need a alignment, and it will not be cheap to do, with the "I" beams. 

B. The tailgate design could have been done with side-opening doors, which would make it easier to reach into the truck, and be less wear on the gate with years of opening and closing. The designers did not think this out too well, as the torsion bar gives when the rust gets at the base of the door, with the pressure of shutting it over-and-over, with time. 

C. Being a fan of manual shifting, for gas mileage, optimum power, and less wear, I was not pleased with the number of owners who chose to stay with the auto transmission for such a truck of a truck world. This made it hard for me to find a Bronc with a manual, which forced me to buy a auto transmission version. But, this is more of a preference, not a failing of the truck.

D. Finally, the tire size could be larger, for aesthetic and function purposes of handling. But, considering these things, I have not seen as attractive a rigg as the late model Broncos. It is only a shame that someone at Ford decided to make a stupid decision to remove these beasts from the road.
