            My wife picked out this car. The significance of that being that she has picked the best cars we have ever owned. I pick the lemons (usually). She normally drives compacts because she is small (5'2&quot;), they get better gas mileage (she drives approx 40 miles, one way, to work), and they are normally cheaper in general. We got a good price on the car. It had about 65k miles and was in very good condition. We've had the car for about a year and the only things we've had to put into it are gas and oil. I have never owned a Dodge until I purchased this car. I must say this is the best car I've had since my 87 Toyota Corolla FX-16. Very reliable, quiet, smooth, comfortable. While it has a great deal of room (cab forward design), the only problem is I wish it had a little more headroom for the front seats. I am 6'2&quot; and it can be a little tighter than I would like, but it isn't tight enough to keep me from driving it. I would highly recommend this car to anyone wanting a reasonably priced small to mid-size car. It's a four-cylinder so it's good on gas and still has enough power to get out of a tight spot in traffic. I can't give you exact figures on gas mileage. I can only tell you that she puts about 500-600 miles on this car a week and only has to fill the tank every 7-10 days. It's a comfortable car and handles very well.<br><br>
