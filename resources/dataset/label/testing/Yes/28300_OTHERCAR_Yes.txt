            Backstory: To start off, I'll discuss what I had before this, which will let readers know where I'm coming from. Before the Canon ELPH, I'd used a 2MP Fuji 2600 (which has been replaced by the 2650). I got that camera a little over a year ago. Originally quite pleased with it, aspects of it started to bother me - colors didn't have the snap I was looking for (appearing anywhere from satisfactory to washed out in bright sunlight), while the camera performed very inconsistently in low light. The camera took Smart Media cards, which don't seem to be used by anyone now (bummer), and 2AA batteries. Battery life was about 100 pictures, a little more if I was lucky.<br>

Shopping/What I considered: I wanted to replace the Fuji, but I also was looking for something very specific. I wanted a camera that was small enough to quickly bring out, be ready to take a picture and put right back in my pocket. The Fuji was decently quick to get out and together to take a shot, but I wanted to cut down that time even further and the Canon certainly succeeded in that regard.


I often do city photography and I didn't want something bulky or extremely expensive. I also wanted a strong zoom, but I would take features, small size and quality if I found one that offered both of those, but weak zoom. Considerations included a Panasonic, a Toshiba, one of the Nikon Coolpixes and one of the 3.2MP Sony Cybershots.

Other Canon Options: There is also an S200 ELPH (2x optical zoom, 2MP) and an S330 ELPH (3x zoom, 2MP). The numbering is odd, but I thought I'd mention these options for those not needing 3.2MP or seeking something less expensive. Some may also prefer the 2MP and 3x optical zoom of the 330 over the 3MP, 2X optical zoom of the 230.

What Does It Look Like?: Those seeking a "pocket" camera will be more than pleased with this ELPH. It's not a "pants pocket" camera, but a "shirt pocket" one - it should easily fit in any shirt pocket. What I also liked about the ELPH camera was the build quality. The Fuji that I had had a plastic camera body that felt fragile (the weak battery door recently broke off of it). The ELPH, on the other hand, has a solid steel frame and looks that are sleek and dare I say, kinda sexy (turn it on in a bar to draw the ladies...lol). The coolness factor - something that should never take priority over performance, but should still be considered - is a definite 10 here. Despite its size, this certainly doesn't have a "Fisher Price" toy-ish appearance. The ONLY issue with the camera's build quality is the rubber cover over the A/V and USB port - I looked at it and went, "well, that's not lasting long". It's not really entirely necessary, but I just can't understand why Canon skimped in that one area, given that the rest of the camera is built like a tiny tank.

As for what's where, the top of the camera has the shutter release button, zoom and the power button. To turn on the camera, one must hold the power button for a couple of seconds (this keeps it from being turned on accidentally when traveling in a pocket or bag). The back of the camera has the LCD screen, as well as four buttons below the LCD (including menu and white balance) and four buttons next to it, arranged in a circle (including flash and macro). The viewfinder and mode (movie/review/record) adjustments are also on back. On the front is the lens (obviously.), the microphone (you can record sound w/your movies), the focus-assist light and the flash. The CF card slot is on one side, while the A/V and USB cord connection is on the other. The battery slot is on the bottom, along w/tripod hole.

Other Pros:

* The LCD is bright, detailed and easy-to-view, even from a moderate angle. Some may find it a bit difficult to see in the brightest daylight, but I could still make it out surprisingly well in bright sun.

* There is no lens cover. Once turned off, the lens retracts into the camera and two doors shut behind it. When out, the lens also is a little bit back, making it more difficult to get fingers on it.

---------------

Performance/Speed: I took this camera into the city to take pictures and put it through its paces. I took, in a matter of about 3 hours, 167 pictures. Breaking that down, I was very pleased with all aspects:

* The camera powers up quickly and the lens extracts within a couple of seconds. It's easy to take the camera out of your shirt pocket. Overall, I wanted a camera that could be out and ready in less than a minute and this camera certainly passed this "test". The lens is also quick to retract and the doors close.

* Shutter speed (adjustable for low-light situations, but I'll get to that later) seemed quite good. I took a picture of a truck that was passing in front of me from right to left, going down the street. In the actual picture, the truck was surprisingly close to where it was when I clicked the picture. With my prior Fuji camera, the truck would probably have been out of the frame by the time the camera captured it. I also captured birds flying overhead with much success (and no droppings on my head, thankfully).

* Picture-to-Picture speed. For a 3.2MP camera, I was very pleased with the time between when a picture is taken and the camera is ready for another one - it seemed to be only a couple seconds. One also has the option of the "continuous shoot" mode, which allows one to take several pictures back-to-back before the camera gets itself together and writes what you've just taken to the card. <br>

* Battery Life. Keep in mind, I'm coming from a camera that required 2 AA batteries and would run out of power after about 100 shots, more or less. Some have complained about the battery life of the Canon ELPH (it takes a specific Lithium-Ion battery), but after one particular trip, I could not have been more pleased. I took the previously mentioned 167 pictures (some w/flash) - with the LCD on while I was doing so -, reviewed the pictures for 10 minutes afterwards, and still didn't get a "battery low" warning. Speaking of the "warning", that's a negative regarding this camera - it really doesn't have any "battery low" warning until you're about to run out.

Image Quality:

For a camera with a very small lens without a fancy name (Carl Zeiss, Leica, etc...), pictures seemed to be quite good. I was very pleased with the jump in image quality from the 2MP Fuji to the 3.2MP Canon. I saw strong detail into the background (in other words, depth to the image), very good definition and vivid colors. It was a pleasure to take a picture of a bright flower and have that bright, rich color appear to be captured accurately. Low-light pictures seemed to be strong, as well; the camera has a focus-assist beam that aids it in focusing in low-light situations. The flash is okay; I believe the camera says it's good for something like 9 feet and that seems about right. The camera also has a 9 point AiAF system (Artificial Intelligence AutoFocus), which intelligently focuses the image if one holds down the shutter release halfway.

There are a couple of problems that some have encountered with image quality, however. Some have noticed "red eye" problems with portraits, even when "red eye correction" is turned on. Some have noticed a very slight "halo" effect around high contrast objects. Personally, I have not seen red eye issues - in fact, portraits taken with flash looked quite good and accurate. However, in a handful of pictures I have noticed a slight lavender/purple fringe around high-contrast objects. This, however, was not readily apparent until I zoomed in further. I have not seen it noticably in final pictures printed.

The Zoom is also rather weak at only 2x. Personally, I can accept this, but this camera is not going to work for those seeking something for nature photography. There is an additional 3.4x digital zoom on this camera, but I would not recommend it too much - although it does offer a bit more zoom, it also makes for a slightly fuzzy image.

Overall, at best, the Canon presents some absolutely marvelous pictures. There's a smoothness to the images - well-defined shadows, good fine detail, no "jaggedness" or pixelated appearance - that's very pleasing to the eye. When you playback images in camera, the display reminds you what settings you had for that particular shot and also shows you a histogram to analyze the image's dynamic range.

As for resolution, one can choose between Small (640x480), Medium 1 (1024x768), Medium 2 (1600x1200 S200 maximum), and Large (2048x1536).  There's also superfine/fine/normal compression options. The camera will let you know how many pictures you have left based upon what option you're currently on.

Features:<br>

The camera offers plenty of tweaks. 

* ISO setting can be adjusted from between 50 and 400 (or Auto)

* White balance can be adjusted (different settings) and the camera can even "evaluate white balance" (based upon a sheet of paper held in front of it, for example)

* exposure can be adjusted.

* Additional settings such as vivid or neutral color, low sharpening, sepia and black and white (and the B & W's looked awfully good).

* DIGIC processor (new technology from Canon for digital cameras... apparently improves camera photo quality based on analysis of setting/elements of image)

* Evaluative light metering system makes for correct exposures in varying conditions. Spot metering is also available.

* Stitch mode - allows one to "stitch" together several shots to form a panoramic image. (Quite neat.)

* Long shutter speed (can be adjusted for up to 15 seconds; noise reduction is employed, as well, during long shutter shots).

* 9 point AiAF system (Artificial Intelligence AutoFocus).

* Improved movie recording with audio (up to 3 minutes).

* Will print directly to compatible printers.

* You can see your pictures or movies on your TV quite simply by hooking up the camera with the supplied cable.

- The features should be familiar to those familiar with digital cameras. The layout and controls of the features are good, but may take a little while before one learns exactly how things work ("If I press this and this, I get this" kinda thing) and the buttons are a little small (although the fact that I have giant hands may be an issue). For those unfamiliar with digital cameras and their features, a surprisingly excellent manual is included, which goes over everything in easy-to-understand terms.

---------------------

What comes with it? Software, battery, battery charger, 16MB CF card, camera (if the camera's not in the box, there's definitely a problem), manual. 

* Get a bigger card. The 16MB card essentially allows you to test out your camera. Given the limited amount of space, it doesn't have much more use than that. 256MB compact flash cards cost about $45-60 dollars, and that should be enough of a card for most (although there are also 512MB and 1GB cards available).

* Get another battery. I think the battery life on this camera seems very good so far (although again, this is coming from someone who's previous camera used AA's, not Lithium Ion batteries), but it's good to have another battery available just in case.

* The software isn't bad. Some have complained about the included software (Photoimpression 4 - oddly enough, the same software program that came w/my Fuji). It's certainly no Photoshop, but it does allow a pretty decent set of adjustments.

* Get a CF Reader. A compact flash card reader isn't a bad idea, either. These inexpensive (I got a very nice little one for about $15 bucks) devices hook into your computer through the USB port. You stick the card in and your pictures come up.

* Additional add-ons...there's other accessories that can be purchased for the ELPH, including an underwater housing and an AC adapter.

Overall, the ELPH 230 is a superb camera that provides useful tweaks, very good-to-excellent image quality (save for a couple of possible minor concerns) and solid functionality.

It's a good camera for those on-the-go, who want to have the camera at the ready and have it ready to go when a picture opportunity arises. Its tiny size means its wonderfully portable, but it also does make for some trade-offs (zoom, small flash). Still, the ELPH manages to pack a surprising amount of quality and features in the tiny, sturdy package. I'm very pleased and would certainly recommend this camera.<br>
