            When starting our family of 3 we were looking for a vehicle that was a little larger than our car. We chose the Jeep Cherokee, 4door, auto transmission.  We have no frills on our truck, but it is wonderful.  It is very dependable, and at 120,000 miles (mostly country driving) it is still driving like the day we purchased it.  The vehicle provides me with a very secure feeling when I load my children into it, and it is also extremely manageable.  The vehicle has enough cargo space to carry plenty of groceries plus all of the toys that ride around with me.  The only drawback is that the back seat area is a little small.  It suits my 3 children, but would not carry 3 adults comfortably.  Also, the removable drink holder is an irritation as it attaches in the passenger leg area.  This holder is knocked off at least once a day.  All in all, we love our truck and will certainly entertain the idea of purchasing another in the future.   <br><br>
