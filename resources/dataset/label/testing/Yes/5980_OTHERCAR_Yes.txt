            I own a 1991 Volvo 240 with 129,000 miles.  It has been nothing but a blessing to me!  I have never been in a vehicle that feels so sturdy and confortable.  In the two years that I have had the car, I have seen new vehicles bite the dust!

   The vehicle has a comfortable, rugged, yet assuring ride.  The steering isn't overly torqued, but isn't as buttery as a Camry.  The brakes don't hold the car back; they grab the car, which keeps the car from submarining during hard stop situations.

   My air conditioner freezes and has never been charged since it was originally built in 1991.  I LOVE my seat heaters and the rear defroster is POWERFUL.  I just received a 100,000 mile badge from Volvo and mounted it on the rear.

   Driving the 240 has led me to researching them.  Now, I can tell what year any 240 just by looking at it!  Other than the airbag, three-point safety belts, refined chassis, and submarining engine (lest we not forget the crumple zones) a reason to buy a 240 is simply because it's unique!  It's also a little powerhorse.  I refuse to believe that it only has 114 hp!<br><br>
