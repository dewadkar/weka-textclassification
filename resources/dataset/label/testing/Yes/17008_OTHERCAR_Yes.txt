            I researched and drove BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, loaded 4Runner, Lexus, and Landcruiser.  The MDX competes or excels in the combination of horsepower, ride, roominess, and features.  I am totally happy with mine, although I had to wait 3 months and pay full price.  I am 6' 4'' and have enough head & shoulder room.  Extras like heated seats & mirrors, 3rd row seating, 6 disc in dash Bose stereo, sunroof, etc. are all pretty much standard.  The grab handles don't snap back to the roof-they are pneumatic.  Both the second AND third row seats recline (slightly).  You can fit a 4ft. wide sheet of plywood flat in the back.  10 cup holders.  If you have a dog, check out the canvas cargo area fitted cover; it's sweet (with a cost to match...).  Suspension and handling are excellent; torque is good; ground clearance is good.  Navigation system is great for new areas of big cities and out of town trips, but is pricey (2000) if you drive consistent routes.  Heating/AC system is impeccable and includes auto-temp and separate controls for the rear.  My only complaints are gas mileage (worse than my Civic ;), occasional wind noise with a specific combination of rear/front window heights, and the lack of side trim to prevent door dings.  Get one and forget about it - you won't be sorry.
