            I hate big vehicles.  I hate SUVs.  So why do I love my wife's 1997 Pathfinder?

We bought it in late January 2000 fresh off of a lease--she wanted to get rid of her 98 Wrangler (too uncomfortable) and had always wanted a Pathfinder.  Thanks to the Xterra, no one wanted Pathfinders, so we got a pretty good deal on an XE 4wd model with a stick.

The ride?  Smoother than a compact car (97 Prizm, 99 Corolla, 2000 Saturn SL1, 1999 Sentra), but not quite a Buick.  

The driving experience?  I had rented an Infinity QX4 with the automatic (same engine, approximate same weight) and found it very underpowered in the mountains.  This Pathfinder with a stick is great, even at 7500 feet.  It's no race car, and I doubt that it'll outrun a Grand Cherokee Limited with the big 8-cylinder engine, but it has more than enough power for most &quot;reasonable&quot; uses.  Then again, I've tried to keep up with one going over 105mph on open road, so it may be good for not-so-reasonable uses as well.  It's also relatively nimble.  I'm a shockingly boneheaded driver (the annoying guy who turns U-Turns into 3-point-turns), but I can U-turn it where I would never expect to be able to.  When you drive it, it just feels good.  Solid, but not sluggish.  Nothing like what I would have expected from a truck.  In fact, it's somewhat like the feel of the Town Car that I rented a week ago.  You get enough feel to know that you're driving (although it's much more feel than the Town Car), and the steering isn't particularly quick, but you get there in good enough time and without too much effort.  You can even parallel park it.

All of this being said, I have a hunch that a Pathfinder with an automatic and the 170hp engine (everything before the 2001) may not be as fun to drive as you constantly fight to get it into some gear that can keep you at speed.

OK, one more thing about the stick....  You can do anything in ANY gear.  Want to be cheap and save gas by throwing it in to 5th at 35 mph?  Not a problem.  This has enough low-end (and mid-range and high-end) torque that you not only won't stall out, but can still accelerate.  The stick on the Wrangler was nowhere near as much fun.  It's almost like driving an automatic, but you still have the stick if you want it.

I've read complaints that it is quite small.  By the standards of a Suburban, it's small.  But it will carry four adults comfortably, and fit between 15-20 bags of groceries without stacking them on top of another or folding down the rear seats.  In other words, it's adequately large for a couple, and maybe even a family of four (if they pack reasonably and/or use the roof rack).

The CD sound system is quite good--the ear level tweeters (on the pillar between the windshield and where the door fits) make sound exceptionally clear, if a bit overbright by car stereo standards.  The ergonomics are good--the controls are where you'd expect them, and easy to operate.

The cost?  These things are supposed to run forever, and are relatively cheap used.  You should be able to pick up a low mileage 1997 for somewhere in the $14-16k range.  Just think....  The usable life on a 1997 Pathfinder is probably still longer than the life on a NEW Ford Explorer for $20-30k.  These are great for anyone who just has to have an SUV, but doesn't need to be able to carry all of their furniture in the back.  I also wouldn't buy one of these if you don't drive stick.  The general attitude problem of stick drivers notwithstanding, this really is not fun to drive with an automatic (e.g., it's less fun than a Corolla with an automatic trying to go up hills).  

I still hate trucks, especially putting gas in them (15mpg on the freeway--ouch).  But if you have to drive one, I don't think that you can do much better than the Pathfinder.<br><br>
