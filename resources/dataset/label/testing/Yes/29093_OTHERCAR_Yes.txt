            About a year ago, my father bought a new 1999 Toyota Tacoma 4x2 Prerunner.  It's fully loaded with all the bells and whistles including the extended cab and automatic transmission.  
He wanted something with the height and ground clearance of a 4x4, but didn't want to spend an extra $2,000 or $3,000 for four wheel drive.  He was initially going to spend that extra $2,000 or $3,000 for the four wheel drive on a Ford Ranger or Dodge Dakota, until I told him to take a look at the Toyota Tacoma Prerunner.  Prerunner indicates that it is a 4x2 with the 4x4's tires and suspension.
So far, he loves his Tacoma.  Suprisingly, the 2.7L 150hp 4-cylinder engine is quite powerful, even with automatic transmission compared to the 3.0L V-6 powering the Ford Ranger.  It is a very, very quiet running truck.  You can easily get it up to 80mph without having to floor the pedal like in some other trucks.  It's also a very stable truck, I guess because it has very large grippy tires on it.  The only problem I found with his truck, is that it is geared way too low in fourth gear.  Every time the truck goes up a small (very small) incline it downshifts.  So, it's constantly downshifting all of the time.  However, the transmission is very smooth shifting.  At 70mph it only revs at about 2,200rpm, which is very low for the engine to be revving at 70mph.
He only has about 25,000 miles on the truck, so I can't fairly comment on the reliability.  If you are looking for a well built compact pick-up truck that looks like a 4x4 but has the virtues of a 4x2, take a real close look at the Toyota Tacoma 4x2 Prerunner.<br><br>
