            The Volkswagen Jetta, along with the Golf, has become a symbol on college campsues across the nation.  They are reliable, well-styled, affordable, and easy to maintain.  It seems you can't swing a dead cat without seeing a third-generation Jetta around, and rightfully so.  They're great cars, and can be had in great shape for $6000 up.

But what if you're looking in a lower price bracket?  I found myself in that exact predicament when I killed my 1990 Passat and was left with $3500 from an insurance check.  The Jetta III seemed like a great choice; reliable, airbags, and it looks sharp.  However, it was about $2000 out of my price range.  So, I shopped the previous model year, and boy did I find out what alot of others found out, and what many more are missing!

You don't have to spend that extra $3000.  Stash it away for a vacation.  Preferably, a road trip, because you'll love driving this car.  I bought my 1991 Jetta GL for $3400 with CD player, sunroof, and 5 speed manual transmission.  It has no rust on it, and had 117k miles.  Even with that many miles, this car is well mannered at city speeds and peppy when you wind it up.  The gear spacing is near perfect, though I would prefer a slightly taller 5th gear... still, I'm getting around 32mpg at highway speeds.  This car has been averaging 28 or so mpg with mixed driving.

Make it a point to check the suspension thoroughly.  This model came with a nice suspension with great feel for the road, but a couple shot struts could make the already bumpy ride a literal pain in the back.  The 8 valve 4-cylinder engine has good throttle response, though its not the most powerful car on the road (especially with 100k+ miles on it).  The interior is comfortably roomy, the seats are inviting, and there is enough room in the back for kids or some adults under 5'10&quot;.  Also, trunk space is amazing... I've been able to haul a box of copy paper, 2 duffel bags, and $15 worth of empty cans and bottles all in the trunk.

Not only is the car fun to drive, it's very worry-free for a nearly ten-year-old car.  I highly reccomend purchasing a warranty or buying from a shop that guarantees thier cars for a short time.  The mechanic I bought mine from guaranteed it for 2 months, which was just enough time to get the kinks out of it and get it running smoothly.  These cars tend to sit on the lot a bit longer than thier younger cousins, so they need a bit of a workout and a tune-up to get back into shape.  Once into shape, you'll have little problems, as this car is really solid as a rock.  even if you tend to push your car a bit, you won't experience the major problems that first model VW's (such as the Corrado and B1 Passat) seem to have.

Inspect around the rear bumper and the wheel wells for rust.  Those are the most common areas for it to appear, and it's sometimes difficult to notice at first.  Test the brakes and make sure they are adequate for you; this car is equipped with front disc and rear drum brakes, so brake fade at the wrong time can be a bad thing.  It is actually relatively easy and cheap to upgrade the rear brakes to discs if neccessary.

Maintenance is a dream.  It is simple to peform regular maintenance such as oil changes, spark plugs, etc with the right tools.  Also, because it is an older car and there are so many of them around, it's easily serviceable by almost any shop.  Any mechanic worth his salt knows how to work on an old Jetta or Golf.  Also, if you have any unfortunate mishaps, parts are very cheap.

As a final note, if you're into that kind of stuff, there are TONS of performance options available for this model.  In fact, it is often preferred over the Jetta III for modifcation because of its lighter weight and simpler engineering.  The rear disc brake modification is only the beginning, there are so many options for this car from styling with aero kits to performance upgrades like turbo or superchargers.  If you're looking for a good car to get into the world of auto modification, this may be the one for you.  If you want more information about modding your VW, check out the magazine 'VW Trends' (You can read my review of it here as well).

All in all, if you're short on money and looking for a first or second car, The Jetta II is a great choice.  You'll be happy with the reliability, comfort, and fun of this car, I guarantee (for 2 months or 2000 miles, whichever comes first).<br><br>
