            After careful and thoughtful consideration as to which new luxury sports coupe I should purchase, I decided to purchase a new Black/Black Mercedes Benz CLK 320 with K3 option for the following reasons:

Number one and most definitely a major factor in my purchase decision would have to be the striking styling that is quite destined to become a classic.  In short, I can't drive this car anywhere without attracting major league attention.
I've owned a lot of hot cars but for some reason if you drive this car anywhere you will immediately notice that most everyone that you pass will turn their head. Therefore, if your desire is to remain anonymous and blend in with traffic, don't buy this car.

Number two and a major factor resulting in my purchase decision was performance.  I've owned a 1965 mustang, a 1968 Nova SS, a 1977 Z28,two CRX Honda's and a 1991 Mazda Miata and let me tell you, this car can run with all of them and still perform with a very high level of luxury.  On a recent outing with the Mercedes Benz Club of America at Thompson Drag Raceway the car turned in an elapsed time of 15.69 seconds in the standing quarter mile at 89 miles per hour... and that's without manually shifting the automatic... That is pretty quick folks! Especially when considering that I'm not a professional test driver.  I'm sure that with a little practice the car can run in the lower 15 second range.

Number three, the CLK 320 with K3 package is an absolutely stunning  perfect luxury sports coupe for a professional to use as their own personal means of transportation.  It's not meant to be used as a people hauler, to drive the kids around or for grocery shopping, even though all of these tasks can be performed with this car quite well.  Once you have spent a few days behind the wheel, you will become aware of the true purpose of the CLK 320 which is to make a statement upon arrival at your next important business appointment.

Number four quality fit and finish, i.e., the bodywork, paint and interior are flawless, which is unusual for a modern day automobile.

Number five, the ergonomics are superb for the average person.  The power seat adjustments allow for an almost infinite number of driving position variations and all the pedals and hand controls are right where they're supposed to be.

Number six, the rear trunk storage capabilities are excellent and the rear seat folds down for additional storage which becomes quite handy for hauling everything from real estate business signs to excessive luggage.

If you decide on installation of the optional trunk mounted CD, shop around for the Becker 2662 CD which is a comparable replacement to the O.E.M. Mercedes model for $495, i.e., nearly half the price. 

The above opinions are based on my experience with the CLK 320 over a period of 13 months.<br><br>
