            I had this camera for about 2 years and it worked great.  The controls are very easy to use. The picture qualiity is decent for small prinouts or, for e mail/web applications.  This is a typical point and shoot camera.  Open the integrated lens cover and, fire away.  The preview feature is nice.  This way if you take a bad pic, you can easily delete it and free up memory.  There are also a couple of different ways to preview and review the pictures and then you have the option of keeping or deleting them.
The software that comes with the package is also very straight forward and easy to use.  There's even a couple of cool features to print "fantasy" type pictures or, add a whole host of special effects.
My one gripe with this and, pretty much all digital cameras if the short battery life.  It's something you learn to deal with though.  Myself, I went out and bought rechargeable batteries and a charger.
Honestly, the only reason I got rid of this camera is because Polaroid was offering an upgrade to owners of the PDC640.  Otherwise, I'd probably still have it.
