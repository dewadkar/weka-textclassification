            As the owner of a 2000 S2000 (silver/red interior), here are my thoughts at 3,000 miles.

This car is incredibly fun to drive.  With the top down on a sunny day, you will be hard-pressed to drive another vehicle that offers as good of a &quot;driver experience.&quot;  Yes, the car looks better in person that car mag photos would indicate.  I've discovered to my surprise that it has incredible curb appeal. I also own a '98 Integra Type-R which always got stares and great comments around town. But EVERYWHERE I take the S2K, people stare and comment about its beauty and unique looks.  I'm certain this car will give you more positive attention than any Porsche Boxster or Z3. Consider these unsolicited comments:

- &quot;What is that?  It's beautiful!&quot;
- &quot;Let me hear the VTEC!&quot;
- &quot;I've never seen that.  It looks great.&quot;
- From a valet, &quot;I love this car.  It looks like a Ferrari! We are parking this in VIP!&quot;; &quot;Sir, that's a beautiful car.&quot;

The engine revs to a thrilling 9k redline.  The red leather seats are wonderfully supportive and look gorgeous.  The stereo isn't great, but not a bad as some car mags have mentioned. The handling is great, although it gets a bit twitchy sometimes which can be handled by feathering the throttle.  The top mechanism works well and fast in only 6 seconds.  Yes, the rear window is plastic but the window polish sold at Porsche dealers works wonders to clear up fogging.  The sound level with the top up is pretty low (compared to a very loud Type-R). The 6-speed shifter has an incredibly short throw.  All it takes is a flick of the wrist. However the aluminum shift knob gets hot as an iron in summer weather and cold as ice in winter.  You've been warned. 

Options I have are the chin spoiler (recommended to give it an extra-aggressive look), the 6 disc CD changer, wind screen (a must), and floor mats. 

Yes, there are dealer markups on this car.  However, I submit that owning an S2K is an immensely satisfying experience.  Once you've bought the car, you won't dwell on how much it cost, but how much satisfaction you have in owning and driving it on a daily basis.  You WILL find yourself staring at it because it is a gorgeous car to behold as random people will attest to as you drive it around town.  Take my word for it.  Z3s and Boxsters are everywhere and get little attention these days.  The S2K is relatively rare, looks very unique, and will satisfy you to no end if you are fortunate enough to own one.
