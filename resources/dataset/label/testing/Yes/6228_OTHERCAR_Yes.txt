              Owned a Jeep Wrangler, A Land Cruiser with lockers and a V8 transplant, quite a few Toyota trucks, domestic 4 wheelers, so what am I doing driving this "sissy old man truck"? Well, for one thing, I got old! I also find almost all my old off road haunts paved over with new housing developments, ot illegal to explore anymore.  Oh yeah, and now, since it cost's about $25,000.00 + to buy a nice 4 wheeler, WHO in Heavens name want's to go out and REALLY trash his or her truck in the dirt.  Come on now......be HONEST! What I have here is a truck that will make a good enough trail truck, and haul all my old man little gadgets & toys along with me. It is comfortable to my 6'2" frame as well as my wife's 5'8" frame.  And when we get there, we are BOTH still in a good mood and nobody is trying to kill anyone over anything.  Been married for 20 years???? Ya know what I'm talkin about here then don't ya! 
  This a truck to be comfortable in and to do a lot of different things well in.  Not the best at ANY darn thing, it's just that it WILL do almost anything, all at once. This is worth a lot to me.  Being a confirmed truckaholic, it has been a year and i still have it.  I am a little "miffed" at Nissan for a complete body makeover after only 1 year, but I can handle it.  By the way, I think this is maybe the absolute UGLIEST truck I ever bought?  But finally, after a year and heavy eyeballing of the 2001 Frontier, I think I "MAY" be, just MAY be happier with the looks of this one???? Gonna take a few more beers to be sure..... Bottom line, this truck is a camelian of sorts, it just goes along doing whatever you need it to do.  Not real exciting, but competent. Geez, kinda like that marriage thing again?
  Power?   The truck has enough "power" for me.  Acceleration? Slow, and there is a difference here.  I live in San Diego Suburbs where quick acceleration would be much appreciated. But again, it's NOT so bad I get run over. Gas milage?  Well, I got better with my 97 F-150 Lariat 2WD.  What can I say? If you want a truck to impress others, this may NOT be your truck?  If you want a truck that will impress "you", it may be just what you are looking for.  It has turned out that way for me. It really is a practical, useful, do all vehicle. That 2.9% financing that lured me into the showroom didn't hurt either!
  In July 2001, I traded this truck for another Toyota. The terrible gas milage, and hard to operate transfer case just got to be too much. After a lot of gear grinding, found out the owners manual as well as operation stickers inside the truck are ALL mismarked on how to operate the 4WD system!!!! On the automatic, you need to stop fully, place the transmission in Park, THEN shift to 4WD either low or high range. I imagine there are going to be a large among of owners who follow Nissan's instructions and spend several thousand dollars down the road on a new transfer case. The rear bed also just turned out to be too small to serve any useful purpose for us. Wish it wasn't so, but it WAS so. Loved the truck, but it just had too many things that really got under my skin after "living" with them for over a year.
