            I bought my van used, and got a pretty good deal on it since it was just about loaded and had low miles.  I do love having a van now that I'm outnumbered by my little ones(they're the reason we bought it).  Mine is a 1992 model, and has been very reliable in the almost 2 years that I've had it.  Even in these cold Chicago winters, it always starts up and runs great.  Warms up real quick too..that impressed me!  I do enjoy driving it...I like being up high in the van where you can see better than in a low little car.  I think it's made a great &quot;first van&quot; in that it has converted me into a minivan mama.  It's great for the time being, but I can't wait to get a different one.   The newer ones have some great features now that just weren't available on this one.  That extra sliding door would be nice!  I do like and recommend my van, but be sure to do your homework first.  Dodge/Chrystler vans had a transmission problem for a few years (including 1992).  Luckily, mine isn't showing any signs of a problem, but the dealer did have another van on the lot that I test drove that wouldn't shift higher than 2nd gear.  Speaking of the dealer, it was awful.  If you're in the Chicago area, don't go to Elmhurst Dodge.  That's another LONG story altogether.  My buying experience was awful and it was a MONTH before I had my van, but the van itself is a great vehicle.<br><br>
