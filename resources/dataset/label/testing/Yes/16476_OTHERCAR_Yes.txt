            If your looking to lug around the family and a big and chunky sport utility is not in your budget, then the Caravan would probably be a great match.
It is a very stylish vehicle to drive, and you don't always feel like your in a minivan. At times, it feels, well, kind of sporty!

The gas mileage is quite good, and on long trips the whole family can sit back and enjoy a comfortable ride. Highway noise is minimal in the Caravan, and the ride is also very acceptable.
When driving the Caravan, everything feels tight and in place, except you may discover the odd rattle coming from a plastic peice on the inside of the rear hatch beside the speakers. 

Living without duel-side doors would now be unimaginable as people can climb in and out without crawling on each other.
The air-conditioning is cool, the ride is great, and the comfort is unparralled.

However, the odd rattle as I disscussed above can be a major annoyance, and the leg room in the back is somewhat lacking for someone over 5'11".

All in all, a great purchase!
