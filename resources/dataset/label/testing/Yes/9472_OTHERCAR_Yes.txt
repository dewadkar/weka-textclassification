            Everyone knows that the Dodge Ram is the best looking pickup truck on the road (even though it now has the oldest design out of the Big Three).  I myself own a black Dodge Ram 4x4 Sport with the extended cab and couldn't be happier.  I find the ergonomics outstanding, it has unmatched room, and the utility of the four dours is superb.  Just the raw power of the 660 ci 5.9 Liter V-8 engine is enough to make me love this truck, besides the fact it can pull down a house.  I think it handles great and rides even better, but I'll have to admit, the thing I like most is how high up you are when you drive this behemoth around.  I mean this truck is badass.  One thing I found wrong with my truck was a leak that developed when I got the truck.  It was a factory problem and they fixed it fast.  The only other complaint I have is with the brakes.  It can get pretty scary sometimes when you don't think you are going to stop (this is only on the 1500 series because Dodge installs larger master cylinders on the 2500 and 3500)  Also I chose to not buy the factory CD player, I've heard it in previous Chryslers and I'll tell you this, premium it is not.  Instead I saved my money for a top notch sound system, 3 inches of lift, and plenty of other accessories to make my truck look even better.  I've had it for three years and have loved every day of it.<br><br>
