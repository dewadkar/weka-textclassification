            I replaced a honda civic with this car.  I was looking for a car that had a good ride and was upsized from the civic but I didn't want to pay the price for an accord or some of the others.  This car fits my family well.  The interior is put together well with a very solid feel (no squeaks or rattles) and is very quiet!  The ride is excellent.  The 4 cylinder engine is extremely powerful.  The 4 cylinder comes stock with champion spark plugs.  If you change the stock plugs with Bosch Platinum +4 (part number 4418) you will be shocked by the 4's power.  The engine is a bit noisy at first, however, after the break in period is over (approx. 3000 miles) if you replace the oil with 20W-50 then the engine quiets right down.  Mileage is decent averaging 25 mpg.  I opted for the extended warranty offered by Hyundai that covers the car bumper to bumper 10 years or 100,000 (over and above the standard warranty) because it was a small price to pay (9 dollars extra per car payment) to get BUMPER TO BUMPER for 10 years.  Standard warranty for the car is 5 yr 60,000 mile bumper to bumper and 10 year 100,000 powertrain.
