             I own a 1997 VW Golf GL and absolutely love it. This is a fun, agile, economical car to drive. I have owned the car for 2 years and never once had to go into the shop for any thing but schedule maintenance. Handling is crisp and responsive like you would expect from a German car. High end performance is excellent for a small 4 cylinder, the fuel cut off happens at 112 miles per hour, and will easily reach this speed feeling very confident. Low end performance like most European cars is fairly sluggish but once moving has no problem keeping up in traffic. Fit and finish on the interior as well as the exterior is extremely good for a car in this price range. The seats offer good support with ample head room even for taller people. Luggage room is a bit cramped, this is the only down fall I could find with the entire car. In short this is a true German car worth every penny you spend on it.<br><br>
