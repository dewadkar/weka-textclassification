            Who would have thought me (6'1&quot;) tall guy would end up with a Chevy Metro. I am a chronic complainer, especially when my comfort zone is cramped.
My list of requirements in a new car were:
1) Affordable &gt;$200/mo. 
2) Sexy (I am recently separated) 
3) Comfortable (I have a 2hr. daily commute)

My black 2 door 1999 Chevy Metro has really fit the criteria on all three points. I paid less than $200 for a standard transmission with a 7yr./100,000mi. bumper to bumper warranty. The gas mileage leaves me a little extra cash and my 16y.o. daughter said &quot;Gee Dad, you sure do look cute in your Metro.&quot; Most of all I have a surprising amount of leg room and visibility. It handles sharply and the AC is terrific. It doesn't have a radio but I consider that a good thing. Now I can buy the CD player/radio I really want instead of putting up with standard equipment. 

Don't buy the Metro if you suffer from &quot;little man disease&quot; (low male self-esteem) or are someone who has a history of frequent accidents... even if they weren't your fault. Do buy a Metro if you have limited cash, lots of life insurance, and need a dependable little car. 

This has been a dependable little, smooth running, winter starting, cute, affordable, easy to handle car. That's not bad for 10,000 bucks!
