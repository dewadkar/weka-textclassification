            _High_Resolution_
first, if you're going to buy a digital camera be sure to purchase at least a 1600x1200 camera.  Why you ask?  The answer is simple:  if you ever want to print the photos, 1600x1200 is the minimum resolution that is acceptable to print real looking 8x10 photographs.  Now, many people may say "well I can get by with 5x7's, i don't need 8x10's" but see their's a problem with that:  how often to pictures turn out exactly the way you want?  Many times I've had to crop a picture, which means they're no longer 8x10's.  If the same was done to a camera with a lower resolution (say, 1280x960), then the photos that can be printed wouldn't be 5x7's anymore, they'd be 4x6's or 3x5's.

Now, I'm not saying a 1280x960 absolutely can't print a 8x10, but it wouldn't be "photographic" anymore, it would be painfully obvious that the photos were done on a digital camera since the pixels would be too large and round shapes in a 8x10 photograph would appear boxy and jagged.

_Fast_Photos_
One thing to be aware of when you get a digital cam: make sure it has some kind of fast photo option. The S10 has a fast photo option where it'll take the picture very quickly, resulting in basically no blur unless the object is moving very fast. I've used the feature many times and it's become a life saver, couldn't live without it.  Very few cameras can take pictures of fast moving items (like cars on the highway) and not blur them.

_Size_
another thing to be aware of: size. The S10 is barely small enough for a pocket (4.1" x 2.7" x 1.3"), very nice when you don't want to be carrying around a camera bag and looking like a dork with a big bulky camera. 

_TV_Output_
It also has a very useful TV output, great when you're taking pictures at a party then you can just connect it to the closest TV and watch everyone go "wow" "cool". Another thing you can do with that is put the audio input to a CD or audio station (like satellite stations) and the video to a VCR and make your own little video. I had a friend's parents do that with my cam when they were having a open house for Christmas. Called around and found out something similar would cost them ~$200. 

_Battery_life_
the non-rechargeable lithium ion battery that came with it easily lasted 400 photos, but to replace was $10, kinda expensive.  I purchased the $80 charger and rechargeable battery, now a couple of hours of use with occasional flash and LCD on is ~250 photos, if I didn't use the flash and kept the LCD off 300+ photos would be very easy (if my 64meg card could hold that many!)

I'm no professional at digital cameras, but i did have a Polaroid 640x480 before this one and i'd have to say this S10 is 100% better. If I had to recommend a digital camera, it would be this one, you won't be sorry.
