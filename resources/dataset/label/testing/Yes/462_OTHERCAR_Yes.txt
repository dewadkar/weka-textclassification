GETTING UP THE NERVE!
So there I stood in the blazing afternoon sun, Tumbleweed blowing past my legs, the doors to the building swinging back and forth. Inside stood financial death.</b> There were 6 or more of most clean-cut, well-dressed, slicked hair hot-shots I have ever seen. I debated if I should remount my 86 Monte Carlo and bolt away from the scene or face one of these guys. One would surely challenge me in 2 seconds or less. I decided I would try to slip by and scan the area, hopefully unnoticed I took exactly 1 1/2 steps before I heard a voice from behind and a hand on my shoulder. My instincts said run you fool, run for your life! I was frozen so I decided to turn and to my amazement one of the mysterious men from inside somehow had been beamed more than 100 feet from inside the building to my side. I was in for it now! It was a <b>showdown</b>
<b>
SHOWDOWN AT HIGH NOON!</b>
So we stood face to face, me and this man. He introduced himself and extended his hand. I hesitantly shook it and wondered if this was the man that was going to pilfer through my wallet. The man that would carefully manipulate me into buying one for $10,000 that I end up paying an additional $50,000 in finance and interest. I decided to hear what he had to say. It took me about 5 minutes to get comfortable with him. I started to realize that this guy wasn�t your typical slickster. No, not him. He was a regular guy like me. He just happen to wear a suit because of the job, and his hair was slicked back because he was sweating from being in the sun while wearing that suit. He told me he was a Forklift driver who got laid off and a friend helped him get this job. If you are trying to figure out what I am talking about. The man was a <b>Car Salesman</b>.Not that I have anything personally against this profession but believe it or not, I have been cheated before. I know that sounds impossible to believe but yes, I have run into dishonest people that just want your cash. But this guy seemed genuine.
<b>
A DAY IN THE PARK!</b>
He asked me what I wanted and I told him. He didn�t try to push anything else on me. He let me browse and test drive 3 cars before I found my new baby. I drove them in this order: 

1.<i><b>Chevrolet Caprice</i></b>-I drive one at work and I didn�t want to drive one at home. 

2.<i><b>Chrysler Sebering</i></b> - I actually was going to buy this one until I drove #3.

3.<i><b>Chevrolet Monte Carlo</i></b> - I fell in love

Out of the three cars, the Monte handle better, was more comfortable, and had the best price. I know what you are thinking. Earlier I mentioned that I almost mounted my �86 Monte Carlo and bolted away. Well, although I already owned one, it didn�t really influence my decision. My Monte was to old to compare to my soon-to-be trusty chariot.
<b>
TALKING �BOUT MY GENERATION!</b>
I am currently 31, and men my age seem to lean for the sporty Chic-getting-mobiles or a SUV. Not this dude. I am a Sedan Man. I�m a regular blue collar kind of guy. By this statement I mean that I work hard and I don�t fuss to much about having the outrageously expensive things in life. I judge what I buy on dependability, comfort and a dash of style. Soooo, here are some of the reasons I bought this car:

1.  Decent interior space, seats 5 comfortably.
2.  A V-6 engine that has enough pick up to get around you slow-pokes.
3.  Automatic transmission with the gear shift between the seats.
5.  Decent Gas mileage, 26mpg city &amp; 33mpg highway.
6.  Power everything, to include CD stereo and driver/passenger climate
    control.
7.  I paid $14,000 for it and I didn�t get killed by finance/interest.

I just can�t see spending $50,000 for a ride. Maybe if I had it I would, but would that car be better that my Monte. I don�t know, someday I will find out. Until then, I have a nice car that is half sporty and half luxury. So if your looking for a great car and not a huge car payment,I recommend this car. As I have mentioned in some of my other reviews. I review based on how it feels to ME. Usually not by all the specifications. I couldn�t tell you the dimensions of the exterior or how many liters the engine is. It just ride like a million bucks. Good enough for this guy with a blue collar.<br><br>
