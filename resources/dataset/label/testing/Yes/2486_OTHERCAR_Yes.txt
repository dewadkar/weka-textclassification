            I am a  college student as well as the owner of a 1995 five speed standard Hyundai Elantra.  I strongly recommend this car to college students or any other person that does necessarily have money to spend on a nice looking ride but definitely need a way to get around.

Not only is the Elantra affordable but it has good gas mileage.  My car for example averages out about 350 miles to a full tank of gas which is about 8-10 gallons. 

In addition to having good gas mileage the Elantra is also low maintenance.  I have driven from Florida to New York and from New York to Florida 3 times and the car runs in perfect condition despite the fact that it has 100,000+ miles on it.

i recommend this car for anyone who wants to drive a nice car that is affordable to own as well to maintain and to use.  I also strongly recommend this car for anyone who is willing to pass buying a gas station along with their car purchase.<br><br>
