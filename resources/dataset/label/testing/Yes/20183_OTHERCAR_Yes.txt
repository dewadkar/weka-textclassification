            We bought our suburban brand new in 1995.We purchased the car because we have 4 children and its very roomy.We found some options to be quite good, Like the separate heat and a/c controls in the front and the rear. The suburban also came with a CD player which played very good and didn't skip over bumps.Electronic seats and windows and window locks are a plus.It has a rear seat which comes out easily but once it is out is slightly heavy to move around alone.The middle seats also fold down for even more room if needed.You can open the rear door from the front seat.It comes with keychain to lock and unlock the doors without the keys from a distance.We took the suburban out on the beach and I thought we were stuck for sure but the suburban did great in 4 wheel drive on the beach and in the mountains.The only 4X4 problem I would like to make different is to lift it slightly off the ground,even though we had no trouble clearing objects/embankments.
We put our suburban through a lot of driving ,speeding going 4x4 driving and peeling out and things that were not neccasary for every day driving and it survived very well to my amazement.I cant really think of many drawbacks except maybe finding a parking space or try to make a tight u-turn.The suburban had a strong 350 motor, but still did well on gas. I am currently looking to buy a new suburban.And I recommend this SUV to my family  and anyone who needs room for the kids but likes to play on the weekends.It also drives smoothly.<br><br>
