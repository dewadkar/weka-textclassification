            My parents own a Nissan Maxima, which is very smooth and has a lot of 
power.  It's a 1997 Maxima that has about 45,000 miles on it with no 
problems.  It's very spacious and confortable, and seems to be a safe 
vehicle.  Driving up hills is easy, with no struggles to get to the 
top like other cars that often have to down shift.  The engine is quiet
and just hummms.  I highly recommend not only the Maxima but also all
Nissan products.  This car is good for families, business, and just 
for people who want a smooth ride.  The car is very reliable and I can't say enough about the car and it's good qualities.  The handling is also spectacular and is like driving a race car.<br><br>
