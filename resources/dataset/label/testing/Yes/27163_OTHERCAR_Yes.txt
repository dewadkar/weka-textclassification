            The 1986 Chevrolet Suburban was the last to have a carburetor rather than fuel injection.  The 3/4 in California was the last year not equipped with a catalytic converter.  Both of these features (along with good quality workmanship) lead me to buy a 1986 K-20 4x4 Suburban in the first quarter of the 1987 model year.  It has held up well.  Anyone considering buying something to work on themselves, or to build a monster off-road vehicle should consider a Suburban from 1986.  The stock transmission is the famous Turbo 400.

Gas millage is terrible, however, consider that it does have an 8100 GVW so you can carry a lot of "stuff".  the addition of California "legal" headers improved the millage about 2-4 miles per gallon, to about 12-14.  An aftermarket over-under drive should improve millage even more.
