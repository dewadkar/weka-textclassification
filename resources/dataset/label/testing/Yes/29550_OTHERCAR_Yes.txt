            Let me first say I already own a 96 SR5 4x4 when was in the market for another vehicle for my wife. Our final candidates were the 4Runner, Lexus RX300, and Acura MDX. 1996 was the first model year for this generation.  The demand for this SUV was so hot that dealers were asking a $1000 markup over MSRP.  I manage to pay $1500 over invoice.  Six years later and still on the same generation, we bought another 4Runner.

Engine:  The 3.4L v6 is very adequate, the only time you will complain is when you load it up with passengers and cargo.  But I think you can say that for most vehicles.  The engine is a truck engine, very torquey, you get most of the power right away.  The only maintenance out of routine for my 96 was a head gasket recall that has since been fixed.  No more 4 cylinder in 2001.  In 96 the engine was not underpowered  compare to other SUV,  in 01 the other manufacturers has caught up.

Drivetrain:  Starting in 2001, they have eliminated the 5 speed manual,  only a 4 speed automatic is available.  For the 4x4, they put in the On Demand system from the prior years Limited model transmission on all.  Gone however are the optional electric lockers.  Vehicle Skid Control is also standard.  The 01 transmission is a big upgrade compare to 96.  On my 96 we are not suppose to drive in 4 wheel drive mode unless there is slippage on the road.  With the 01 you can put it in 4 wheel mode at any time, even dry pavement.

Ride:  Typical truck, a love it or hate it ride. Better sit it the rear seats before you decide, some people don�t like the bounces.  If you want something more carish, try the unibody frame.  

Interior:  Can fit 5 adults comfortably but vehicle width is rather narrow.  My main beef is the sound system.  It is rather poor for a vehicle in this price range.  My suggestion is to change those speakers.  I�m glad they move those stupid cupholders that use to block view of the a/c controls.  They added a few more 12v outlets.

Exterior:  I purchase the sport package with the non-functional hood scoop.  If you want the scoop, your color options is reduced down to three, but it looks so cool.  Not sure if the painted grill and bumper will hold up to dings and chips. Did I mention that it is still the best looking SUV on the planet?

The off road capability is outstanding for a stock vehicle.  It can challenge any other stock vehicle in the market.  You might want to take off the running board before you do the serious off road however, simply remove three bolts on each side.

If you like to personalize your vehicle, you picked the right one.  There are so many modifications that can be done that you can spend another fortune before you realized it.
