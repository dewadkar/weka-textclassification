            The 2000 Porsche Boxster is my first convertible car.  Sure, I'd been a passenger in ragtops, but never fell in love with them.  The Boxster is a dream to drive and own. The cockpit is simple but well designed.  The gauges have the best of both worlds, large stylish analog with digital extras at the bottom.  All switches are intuitive, so you're not constantly flipping through the manual just to remember how to operate a feature.  

HOW DOES IT DRIVE?
Take a freeway-ramp curve at high speed and you'll feel this car stick like glue. You can feel why the mid-engine cars seem to handle better.  Your tail isn't sticking out carrying the weight of the engine with it.
This is the Mach V without Spreidel and Chim-Chim in the trunk. 

At 80+ MPH an automatically controlled hydraulic &quot;spoiler&quot; extends from the trunk area to stabilize high speed driving.   It retracts again at 25 MPH. I have fun watching other driver's faces in the rear view mirror as it pops up and down!

OPTIONS I LOVE:
Automatic Tiptronic Transmission
I live in S. CA so the automatic (Tiptronic) transmission looked like the perfect option for me.   In crazy traffic, you can let the computer do all the shifting for you.  When you feel like playing a bit, shift buttons on the steering wheel allow you to upshift/downshift at any time.  If you try to shift too early or late, the computer waits for the perfect time, then does it for you.  There is no clutch pedal, and no need to worry that you'll hurt anything.   

HEADLIGHTS &amp; SEAT HEATERS:
My favorite options are the heated seats and the Litronic electronic headlights.   The heated seats came with my car, and now I can't imagine buying one without that option.  Flick a switch and you can have low or high heat.  It really helps for those cool evenings that still deserve an open top.  The Litronic headlights are expensive ($1500.) but are a must.  One person riding with me said &quot;Seeing with these lights is like driving with glasses on.&quot;  They do make you see the road in a whole new light. 

HOW'S THE CONVERTIBLE TOP?
The electric top goes up or down in about 20 seconds and connects with a simple single latch.  You can't put it up or down while moving, but that's for safety.

ROOM FOR MY STUFF?
As for trunk space there is plenty for a sports car. One front and one rear trunk hold enough for a weekend away, but not enough to tempt you to use your baby as a station wagon. 


HOW FAST IS IT?
Performance is acceptable, but this is no 911. In a convertible going 20 feels fast, but don't worry, this feels like a race car.  Will you win from a stoplight? Probably not, but you'll have plenty of pull in 5th going 100+ MPH.

NEGATIVES? They are few and far between.  The stereo is o.k. but not great.  The convertible window is vinyl and  I'm sure it will have to be replaced in 5 years or so.

With the first scheduled oil change at 15,000 miles, I think Porsche has done a great job at an entry level car.<br><br>
