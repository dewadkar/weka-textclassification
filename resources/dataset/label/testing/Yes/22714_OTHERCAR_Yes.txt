            I own a '95 Plymouth Neon Highline. This is my third winter with the car. (In North Dakota)My neon has been so dependable. There hasn't been one day that it hasn't started, and I don't have to plug it in. If I was to purchase a new vehicle, it would without a doubt be a new Neon! I have a two year old and it has been convenient in getting her around. The back seat is perfect for a car seat. I would recommend this car to all ages, also. It's great on gas mileage. It only costs me $12.00 to fill my tank! I also love the looks of the car. I love the aerodynamics of the car and how low the windshield is. You can see directly in front of you without a big hood in the way. I recommend it for short and for tall people. My father is 6'4&quot; tall and it is even comfortable for him to drive. My whole family loves the car and think it is very economical. I sure agree!<br><br>
