            I have Sportage#000051, bought Feb, 1995  SOHC, non-EX 4x4...
I luv this little vehicle!!!  This vehicle has been nearly flawless from day one.  The few minor problems we've had were fixed quickly and courteously at the dealership(s)...the dealer we bought the vehicle from sold their Kia line to another dealer, which was a bummer because that dealer gave us a coupon book for free oil changes for 4 years, which were not good at the new dealership.  However, we never had any trouble getting service or warranty repairs at a different dealer in Phoenix, and they were always friendly and courteous.

We have almost 80,000 miles on her now and I drive this vehicle to and from work every day.  It's never stalled, never not started (except for the two times the battery died...typical in Phoenix), and never broken down on the road.  In fact, this vehicle has far exceeded my expectations considering both of my prior vehicles incurred significant repair costs long before I got to 75,000 miles.

Our Sportage has only had to be "repaired" once...when the coolant bypass tube o-ring started leaking.  Everything else we have put into this vehicle has been strictly maintenance (oil changes, cam cover gasket, timing belt, tires, brakes, etc.).  Even the OEM tires on this vehicle are incredible...the factory Michelins lasted more than 70,000 miles and still had tread.  I only had to replace them because they were so dry from the Phoenix heat that they started to crack.

If you're looking for luxury and status, don't buy a Sportage.  If you want a reasonably good vehicle at a very agreeable price and you can stand the little quirks, then this is for you.  Just be aware that you may have to search for parts (I'm having pretty good luck with finding them on the 'net), and you may have trouble finding someone to work on it.  Be persistent...any shop that works on Japanese cars can work on a Kia.
I'll grant that parts have been difficult to get and somewhat expensive (who would have imagined that I would have to get spark plugs at a motorcycle shop), but more and more aftermarket parts are available.  I recently bought new front rotors and brake pads aftermarket...but even the dealer price for the rotors was not excessive compared to the local aftermarket parts stores.

I've driven this vehicle in summer heat as high as 125 degrees, in snow up in Flagstaff, in sand up to the hubs, up hills that I thought it would never climb...on road, off road, you name it.  My ONLY complaint is a lack of power when climbing hills on the highways between Phoenix and Flagstaff...and Phoenix / Payson.

I've had many of the annoying little quirks that others mention...the fuse panel door won't close (I removed it)...the check engine light flashes at me on the highway (my Mazda had the check engine light on for 40,000 of the 75,000 miles I put on that vehicle), the front bushings squeak, there is air noise at the passenger side window seal, the valves are noisy and the engine is buzzy at highway speeds, the drive train is clunky, etc.  

Bottom line, I'll take all the little annoyances over the many repairs I put into my previous vehicles any time.  In fact, my wife told me yesterday that she'd take another Sportage over most of the other new vehicles she's been looking at...but only if I let her get one with an automatic transmission.

I'm going to drive this Sportage into the ground...maybe even put a new motor in it at some point and drive that one into the ground.


Update January 2002...she's still alive.  We've got 108,000+ on her.  With the exception of having to replace the coolant temp sensor and the drive belts last summer, and the battery just a few weeks ago, she's not even been in the shop since I wrote this opinion originally.  Of course I've changed the oil, plugs, filters, etc., but no significant repairs to update.

I'm still driving her to and from work every day and have yet to get left stranded.  Even when the battery died, I jump started her and drove to the parts store to replace the battery.  I can't say the same for my other truck...'97 Dodge Dakota.  When the battery in it died, it wouldn't even run with a jump start.

It seems my fuel economy is starting to slip a little, but I guess I can't complain too loudly at this point.  She'll be 7 years old on Feb. 19th and this is the longest I've ever owned any vehicle.  Like I said before, I'm going to keep driving her until she dies...then maybe put in a new engine and drive her some more.

By the way...I checked into a motor just for kicks.  It would be $1700 (not counting installation)...hmmmm.

Final update...the Kia is dead 8-(.
Not because of any defect in the vehicle, rather she succumbed to the dangers of the highway...an accident.  My wife was driving the Kia home from work a couple of weeks ago and rearended a Toyota truck.  To see the damage you would not have thought she was totalled, but the adjuster came up with an estimate exceeding $3500 and they totalled her.  Surprisingly enough, they offered us $5300 for her...not bad for 7.5 years and 116,000 miles.  Anyway, it's not looking like we'll get another one as my wife has her heart set on a Honda Accord and I'm already driving a pickup.  I don't know where they moved her, but I'm sure she'll provide lots of good parts for someone else's Kia.

I hope this has been helpful.  Maybe I'll write about the Honda in a couple of months.
