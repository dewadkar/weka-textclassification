            I ordered this camera for my mother, an all-around electronics novice. Both of us were newbies to the world of digital cameras, but we both found the DC-240 to be extremely user-friendly and the pictures of very good quality. Accessories we bought were the Lexar Media 32MB compact flash and flash card reader, both well worth the investment. Buying the card reader eliminated the need to buy the AC adapter for the camera, since once you're ready to upload the images to the PC, you simply eject the card, slide it into the reader as if it were a floppy, and use the Kodak Picture Easy software to get the images.<br><br>
