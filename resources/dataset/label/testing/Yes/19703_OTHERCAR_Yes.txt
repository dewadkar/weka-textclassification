            I love my 1998 Mitsubishi Galant! I think it's a great car for anyone, regardless of age, social standing or gender. I began leasing my car almost three years ago at the end of my freshman year of college and I have NEVER been less than one hundred percent satisfied with her performance. She is my baby-- an awesome car which combines good-looks and durability. I drive my baby everywhere and she has survived it all (knock on wood), from the five-hundred mile trip to and from college to the harsh climate of Central New York winters. She drives smoothly, gets great gas mileage and most importantly, she tends to impress all the guys with her &quot;phat rims&quot;. I absolutely love my car and am not looking forward to the day when my lease is up and I have to give her back. <br><br>
