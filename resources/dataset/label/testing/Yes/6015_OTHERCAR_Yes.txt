            Basically,the Toyota corolla is a nice solid car.  With good reliability and good manuverability you can't go wrong with this compact car.  There is one bad thing though.  When it is a very cold day this car takes a very long time to start up and might be a pain in the neck.  Also once you start it up you can't put on the heat until the car is fully warmed up.  be prepared to wait a little.  The car doesn't have good cushioning and is not luxirious.  If you are a person who love luxory this car is definitley not for you.  This car is not that expensive for what you are getting.  If you are a person who wants some reliability and doesn't care too much about luxory and doesn't want to spend a whole lot of money this car is by no means for you!  Fun driving!<br><br>
