            In my last review, I described how I narrowed my recent new vehicle hunt down to two choices:  a Nissan Frontier or a Toyota Tacoma.  After spending half a day between two car dealerships, I ended up going with the Toyota.  My last review describes why I did not buy the Nissan, and this review explains why I went with the Tacoma.

Since the early 1980's, the Toyota 4x4 pickup has set the standard for coolness.  In Back to the Future (1985), Michael J. Fox's character's dream truck was a black Toyota 4x4.  Things haven't changed much since then.  Dodge has been doing well with their trucks, while Chevy, GMC, and Ford are still selling, but I don't think anything draws more "oohs" and "ahhs" than the Toyotas.

One thing that I've always loved about the Toyota pickups is that they haven't changed very much over the years.  There have been gradual improvements in the body style, such as better aerodynamics and more sculpted lines.  For the most part, the truck has remained roughly the same size and shape since Michael J. Fox drooled over that one in 1985.

I ended up purchasing a 2003 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with a manual transmission and the 190 horsepower V6 engine.  It has the SR5 chrome package, which basically just means that it has chrome bumpers and better tire rims.  I managed to get a really good price on the truck because it doesn't have a lot of the extra interior features, such as power windows or locks.  It also has a solid rear window, rather than a sliding glass door.  Before I even got to the dealership, I decided to be indifferent about power windows/locks and the glass door.  I was very pleased to see that it came with a combination CD/Cassette player since I do still have quite a few tapes.

I read a review of these new Tacoma's and the author said to be prepared to spend a lot of time at the dealer because there are so many different models and packages available.  I test drove four different trucks before settling with this one.  I did drive one of the 140 horsepower 2.7 liter 4 cylinder trucks, with an automatic transmission, but it just wasn't quite enough for me.  As soon as I jetted out of the dealership with that V6, I said "forget the four cylinder!"  I also looked at the Pre-Runner trucks, which is a 4x2 Tacoma made to look like a 4x4 by sitting up higher.  I am not sure how long they have been making the Pre-Runner, but its a good idea since the older 4x2 models sit a little too low to the ground.

From the outside, the Tacoma is gorgeous.  The front end is sculpted and round, but not so profound as the new Dodge, Ford, or GM trucks.  It is sleek and modern, but still <i>looks</i> like a truck.  I think the domestic trucks try too much to look like a car.  There is some body sculpting above each wheel, although very slight.  All in all, this truck has a very solid, flowing look to it.  It isn't gaudy or overly decorated, but it certainly isn't plain either.

My only complaint about the body of the truck is that the bed is not very deep, compared to other trucks of the same size.  The bed is plenty long and has ample space, but is only about two feet deep.  This would only be a problem if you were planning on hauling anything top-heavy, because it might topple over more easily.  However, the bed is proportionate to the rest of truck, so it doesn't "look funny" or anything like that.  Let's face it, if you really wanted to haul a bunch of heavy material, you would be looking at a bigger truck.  All I want is to haul my four wheeler around, plus maybe a little bit of firewood.

The 4x4 models are a little jacked up, so you have to step up a bit to get inside.  I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and have to stretch just a bit to get in.  I have already ordered some side step rails, though.  For me, climbing into the truck is not a problem at all, but it could be for smaller passengers.

I absolutely love the seats in this truck.  If Toyota got into the furniture business and made recliners out of the seats they put in the Tacoma, I would buy one.  It is very soft and comfortable, and I can honestly say it is one of the most comfortable car seats I have ever been in.  The upholstery is a sort of plush gray patterned material that is very soft to the touch.  It is a little thicker than average, which helps keep you from sliding around in them.

The inside of the truck is nicely done and very comfortable.  The dash gauges are done with a white background that allows the numbers to glow at night, making for a really cool effect.  The white gauges looked kind of weird to me at first, but I quickly adjusted.  I think the Jeep Liberty also has white colored gauges, so maybe it is just the latest trend.  Black letters on a white background <i>are</i> easier to read.

I have two minor complaints about the vehicle interior.  The dashboard clock is located right behind the windshield wiper control stick, sort of under the steering wheel.  This means that you can't actually see the clock while driving - you have to lean forward to check the time.  I don't know why the included CD/Cassette stereo doesn't have a built-in clock.  My only other complaint is that the clutch pedal seems to be a little bit higher than it ought to be.  Over time I'm sure the newness will wear off and it won't seem so stiff to press down.  It is also set at an angle that requires you to scoot up to the steering wheel just a bit.

If you have heard that the Tacoma handles like a car, then you've heard the truth.  This truck will turn on a dime.  My old car was a 2000 Dodge Avenger and this new truck will drive circles around that Dodge.  The V6 motor is quite powerful and acceleration is excellent.  I've actually had some problems with spinning out since I'm not completely adjusted to this new vehicle.  When I first test drove it, I peeled out of the dealership parking lot.  Oops!  It has been several years since I drove anything with a standard transmission, but I am quickly getting the hang of it again.

While on the road, there is a little bit of noise, but no more than what you can expect from a truck.  It's a block on wheels, so don't think it's going to be perfectly quiet like a Mercedes.  If you do a lot of interstate travel, this truck might not be the best thing for you.  When a vehicle sits up this high and has tires as big as this one, there is no way it can be as quiet as a car.

The 2003 Toyota Tacoma is comfortable, agile, and powerful.  For the price, it beats the Nissan Frontier in every possible way.  It gets roughly 20 miles to the gallon and comes with an 18.5 gallon tank, so fill it up and go out for some fun in this great truck.
