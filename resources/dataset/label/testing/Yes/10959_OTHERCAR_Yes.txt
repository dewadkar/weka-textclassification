            I really love this camera. After purchasing a Canon printer (S520, incredible for $80), was so impressed I looked to Canon first for a camera. The balance between price and features in the A300 is just what I wanted. After much research, I decided that I would rather have 3.2megapix than the optical zoom (I only wanted to spend $200). If you must have both, there are plenty of cameras out there for you, but not at this price! 

What I expected (and got):
-High-quality images. I've taken a series of 2048x1536 superfine images of flowers with the macro, and they are incredible. The files are HUGE (between 1.2-1.8M) but they make great prints and desktop backgrounds. Color is excellent. The smaller sizes look good, too, and are better for e-mailing, file-size-wise.
-Digital zoom. Everyone who is shopping for a camera knows that optical zooms are better, so you'll just have to decide what's important to you. I rarely use the zoom, it just ruins the picture quality. 
-16M CompactFlash card. This is just too small for me, and for anyone who plans to use the movie mode. I immediately bought a used 128M card on e-bay for $7.50, and it seems about right. I also bought a card reader for 4.99, and it's quite convenient.
-Easy compatibility with my Canon printer, with the Exif-print feature carrying camera settings right into the printer for more accurate color prints.

What I got but didn't expect:
-Great movie mode! I knew it had this feature, but I didn't think it would be as cool as it is. You can choose from 3 res. levels, and the best one looks decent full screen in WMP or QT. As noted in previous reviews, don't cover the mic with your finger! I disagree with the reviewer that said it has "high-quality sound". It's really not that great. But it is sufficient for just funnin' around.
-Lots of manual settings & extra features! I had no idea I would be able to set custom white balance, focus area, ISO, B&W, sepia, custom sound effects, and so many others! Too many to list!

What I would change:
-I hate the whole "push the button half-way to focus" thing. I guess all auto-focus cameras are like this now, not just these, but I still don't like it!
-I wish it were a little smaller. It's just too big to put in your pocket. Not a big deal, just go handle one before you buy it. I had a hard time finding one in-stock locally, but I resisted ordering mine until I held one in my hand.
-Tiny lens! Okay, the great pictures don't lie, but GOSH it's a tiny lens! This almost turned me away from this camera, but the image quality changed my mind.
-Battery life. The 2 alkaline AA's that came with the camera were dead in under a day. I've switched to NiMH rechargeables, and I'm pleased to get several dozen shots and several movies, with 50/50 use of LCD.
-My el cheapo old digital camera would run off USB power to save batt life while plugged in, but the A300 does not. If you get a card reader or A/C adapter (this is not a dockable camera), it doesn't matter, but it  would be nice.

Well, I hope this helps! Remember, if you're expecting a slim, trim pocket camera, or need an optical zoom, this is not the camera for you. If you want great quality pics and can live without the optical zoom and pocketability, the Canon A300 gives you a lot for your money.
