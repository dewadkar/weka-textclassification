            I bought a used 1996 Windstar GL minivan about a year ago with 51000 miles on it.   I now have 70000 and going strong.   The family loves the van. It rides well, and is easy to drive.  In the past year though, I have spent more than I would like for maintenance.  I had a check engine light come on last fall that took several trips to the shop before it got fixed.   Problem was with coolant leaking into the number one cylander.  That one cost me about 500 bucks.   Now, the speedometer is not working, and getting that fixed will cost around another 400-500 dollars.  

There are a few squeeks and noises that can be heard, usually when turning sharp corners.   The wind and road noises are not bad.   All in all, we love the van, but are concerned with the reliability of this vehicle.  Ford has had some problems in the past with the heads on this type of vehicle which can lead to costly repairs.  <br><br>
