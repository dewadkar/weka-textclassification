            When searching for a new car, it was between the 2003 Honda Accord LX and the 2003 Toyota Camry LE.

Both cars are very similar, in size, comfort, value, and performance.  Being a past owner of both brand for many years, I can say the quality and reliability are top notch.  You really can go wrong with either choice.  

We originally wanted a DX model, which was already included the basic features in today's car like Power Windows, etc.  The AC had to be dealer installed, but that's ok.  What we did not like about the DX was that the door handles and mirrors are black, not body color.  To us, it just does not look complete, like the paint shop took an hour off.  Therefore, we stepped up to the LX model, just based on appearance.

The shape of the Accord is all new, and a bit radical at first.  Like anything new, it will grow on you.  The quality and fit and finish was equal to cars costing more.  I notice the gaps between the body panels on the Accord were tighter than many other cars on the market.  The car also felt solid and strong.  Again, everything you expect from Honda.

The interior was also very modern and with a good use of colors.  What ever plastic material they used on the steering wheel, it really grips, offer a nice comfortable, and full feel.  

The Accord have gotten larger in size, but you don't really notice it.  Meaning about the car is what you expected, if you were a past Accord owner.  The seats fit right and comfortable.  The wipers, the lights are all there within reach.  Exactly where they were, where they should be.  Again, everything you expect from Honda.

The 4 cylinder engine feels good, and sounds smooth.  It's quiet, and seems to offer a quicker response than the Camry.  The automatic transmission also shifts smooth, without attention, the way it suppose to be.  The Accord does have a 5 speed automatic.  This is rare for a car in this price range today.  Although I love the "new technology,"  I honestly can't say I noticed any difference in normal driving compare to Camry's 4 speed automatic.

Handling on the car was great.  The Accord tracks well, and always in control in transition without excessive body roll.  It offers a good balance between comfort and performance.  The solid stable feel does give the driver a confidence on the road, and makes driving fun.

So what I don't like about it?  The rear seats does not split.  It folds as a one piece, with a small pass through.  For a family car, I think this feature is a must, and it's not acceptable for a car in the 20K and above range not to have it. 

In the end we choose the Toyota Camry (also see my review on Camry) not because of any specific strengths or weaknesses on both cars.  Either one will make an excellent choice.  We choose the Camry because the Toyota dealer gave us a better price.
