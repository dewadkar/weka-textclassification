            Being a baby boomer, I never thought I would find another car to replace the heart of my heart a '71 mustang. But alas, I have given my heart to another. The sleek seductive curves of the Monte Carlo, comfort beyond belief, step on the gas on the v-6 and your gone! And I know I'm not alone in feeling like this. A good friend I hadn't seen in 5 years had just bought one also. We had a good laugh, saying this would be our last sporty type car as we were getting up there. 
Who should buy this? Anyone who's not in rocking chair and likes admiring glances when they pull up next to someone else at a stoplight.<br><br>
