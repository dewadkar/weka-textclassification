            Honda has really caught my attention with their 2 door hatchbacks. They are very well built cars that you can depend on. The Civic hatchback that I bought was a DX, and I can tell you, it is a fun car. It runs on a 1.6L SOHC Non-VTEC engine that gives off about 106 horsepower. If that does not seem like enough power, it doesn't really matter. The fuel efficiency is great. But compared to the MPG of the Honda's Insight, it does not stand a chance. It's handling is very good,  no swaying or drifting. I bought this vehicle because I needed a very reliable car that could get me to work without. And with my record so ugly, I could only afford to insure a car like the Civic hatchback. But the good thing is that for those fist time drivers out there, this could be the perfect car for you guys. No more borrowing money from your parents to pay for gas. You don't have to worry about getting too many speeding tickets. This car is not as fast as a leopard, and not as slow as a turtle. It is a great platform to begin modifications to. Modification parts for the Honda Civic are not as expensive as parts for other cars such as the Honda Prelude. I highly recommend this vehicle to all those people like me who need a decent and reliable car.<br><br>
