               This would be my second Mazda. The first was a 1990 MX-6 that I recently crashed. This car, a '93 Mazda 626 was my father's car, but he gave it to me (nice guy!). Now that I've been driving it myself, I have learned that I actually much prefer this car to my '90 model.

Engine/transmission:  C+
   The 2.0 liter four cylinder used in this car is the worst aspect of it. With only 118 horsepower pulling a 2800 pound car, its just runs out of steam really fast. I highly recommend the 2.5 liter 170 horsepower V6. It delivers much better performance and is easier on the eardrums as well. The four speed automatic shifts quite well especially considering my car has 146,000 miles. One thing to keep in mind however is that the transmission used on four cylinder models from 1994 to the present use a troublesome Ford unit rather than the Mazda unit used on my 1993 model. The V6 versions use Mazda automatics and are more reliable.

Handling/steering: A+
   You really have to hand it to the people who designed the steering and suspension system on this car. The 626 is so nimble and light on its feet and the steering is razor sharp. Its such a joy to take this car on a narrow twisty road. It never ceases to amaze me what this car can handle. Although I hear some clunks which concern me, but it was checked out and all was good.  The brakes are also up to the job providing good feel under all conditions. Needless to say, this car is a blast to drive hard.

Interior: A 
   The ergonomics in the 626 are outstanding. The driving position is ideal for me, I'm six foot three and consider the 626 to be a &quot;stretch out and relax&quot; car. Plenty of front seat room. All the controls fall easily into hand and I love the &quot;Swing&quot; vents. The A/C is freezing cold in the summer and the heat almost burns in the winter.The six speaker stereo system that came in the car rivals some Bose systems I've experienced. The sound is very rich and clear.The downside to the interior is slightly lower quality when compared to my '90 model. Some of the plastics used are on the chintzy side and the cloth seats are not not pleasing to the eye. The material is similar to burlap. The '94 and newer models used a softer velvet like cloth. And then there are the cupholders or should I say the cup droppers. They hold coins or liquid pretty well, but I'll be darned if they can hold a cup! Thankfully I don't make a habit of drinking in the car so its not a big deal, for me at least.

Exterior: A
   While its true the 626 design was nothing very original, it has withstood the test of time and manages to look good eight years after its introduction. Its an elegent looking sedan that looks a lot like the old Mazda 929 luxury sedan.And In my opinion looks better than the new '01 626!

Overall: A-
  As you can tell I've grown quite fond of this car. Engine performance excluded, the 626 is and remains a good car and a good value for its class. I'd be a bit leary of '94 and newer four cylinder models with an automatic, but all of the five speed and all V6 models should be just fine. I feel I have a great car that will be enjoyable for a long time. Mazda's former ad slogan &quot;It just feels right&quot; really does apply to this car. Check it out.<br><br>
