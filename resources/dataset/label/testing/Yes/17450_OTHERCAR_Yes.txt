            After test driving various &quot;sporty, but affordable&quot; cars, it became clear that the BASE model 1997 Prelude was the best bang for the dollar on the market in the fall of 1996.

The entry/exit ease was superior to the CAMARO/FIREBIRD twins. The build quality and attention to details was obviously better than the &quot;twins&quot;, the Mitsubishi Eclipse and the Ford Mustang. The comfort and convenience were VERY acceptable. And the pass through rear seat back allowed more package carrying convenience than most of the aforementioned vehicles.
All the best Honda qualities were evident. I am a repeat Honda purchaser and these qualities are a large part of the reason.

The BEST thing about the Prelude is that in either the base or SH model you got the same high output engine. Although only a 4 cylinder, it's nearly 200 bhp output is scintillating when under full acceleration. The magic part is that it is also very driveable without using those high revs. This is relevant today in comparing the new or used models of this car to the smaller displacement HIGH REVVING 4 cylinders in Toyota, Acura and even other smaller Hondas (like the new 2000 sports car). 

The conclusion that this is, for me, the perfect sporty car, seems evident. But there is a small fly in the ointment. A distinct Honda characteristic (now a &quot;feature&quot; of other small displacement sports car builders) is transmission gearing ratios that are too short! In other words, the engine is turning 3000 RPM at about 50 mph. At 70 mph the engine noise is a major distraction if all you are doing is cruising down the highway.  The CD/Radio setup is great for a basic system, but is almost overtaxed by wind, engine and road noise at the 70 mph mark. Your senses will be numbed on a long drive.

Perhaps the answer is to avoid the freeway and charge down the back roads and byways where the sounds from the engine ARE the music.  And the wonderful handling and supple suspension are felt in the seat of the pants. The people that want a sports car feeling without too many sports car compromises should try this car for themselves. The bargain price component remains and it is still an extremely capable car. That it is not better recognized is a shame.  Drive On.<br><br>
