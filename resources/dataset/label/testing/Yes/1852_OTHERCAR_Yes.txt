            Bought a Red 1997 Grand AM SE with the 2.4 L4 and 35k on the clock.  Within 2 weeks it needed new front brakes.  It developed a gas leak shortly after that.  After 18 months I still can't figure out why the rear brakes bind during hot weather or constant city traffic.  Replaced the Alternator, Battery, Water Pump, O2 Sensor one item per week for 4 weeks (never gave me warning that these parts were worn or defective just quit and had to be towed into dealership on two occasions) By 45K the front brakes had worn again! (that's only 20K worth of service if your counting). The steering knuckles had to be replaced also.

Besides the above mentioned repairs (most covered under warranty), I wish it was better on gas. I also wish Pontiac's Engineers had put a little more time and effort into some of the interior design.  The sun visors and rear view mirror are not suited for each other same can be mention about the front cup holder and the gear selector.

Now at 62K its seems the bugs have been worked out of it.  It starts every time and runs well with no hesitation or hint of malfunction.  I have complete confidence in it to go on long hauls or even to let it stretch it's legs at the 108 MPH governed top speed.

I would get another Grand AM but I really want to move up to the Grand Prix for my next purchase
