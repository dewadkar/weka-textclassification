                 The still nameless Saturn SUV will be the hottest thing hitting the auto market in early 2001.  This &quot;small&quot;, sporty truck, is aimed at cars such as the CRV (Honda) and the RAV 4 (Toyota).  This friendly SUV comes standard with a 4 Cylinder DOHC engine which pumps out a very respectable 138 horses (with the 6-cylinder 180 Horse Power Engine available on the upscale model).  Also, this Saturn comes with many innovative features not available with other car companies.  For instance, the standard 4-Cylinder model comes with a Continuously Variable transmission.  Providing increased torque and power. 

     The new Saturn's architecture is also bigger than most of those other companies.  Allowing even the largest to enjoy this great bargain.  The 2 wheel drive version will be released early this 2001.  However, you'll have to wait for the 4 wheel drive version until next fall.  Fully loaded, the Saturn SUV is priced well under $30,000, and due to the great resale value of Saturn's, this is a great long-term investment.
