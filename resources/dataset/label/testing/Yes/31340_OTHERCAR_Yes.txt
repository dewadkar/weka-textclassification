            If you're looking for the ultimate sport sedan that crosses style, power and luxury without skimping on reliability, look no further than the Audi A4. While your friends are out trying to decide which BMW 3 series will separate them from the crowd, the A4 has a place in the car ranks all its own. 

Beyond it's great looks and serious comfort, the A4 is a very reliable car. You won't have to visit the dealer often, but when you do (for scheduled maintenance), it's a real pleasure... great customer service at Audi dealerships. I drive my A4 about 80 miles a day, and the only problem it's given me is a bad wiper blade. While the back seats leave something to be desired (not built for 6 ft and over people), the front seats are very comfortable and the ride is smooth (and quiet!) (Probably best for extended city driving, not cross country road trips)

The trunk is HUGE for a car in this class, and the handling is fantastic, especially with the all-wheel drive Quattro version. The 5-speed is also a pleasure to shift and does so with little resistance. My only issue is that the 96 v6 has less horsepower than the A4 models that followed in 97, 98 and 99... so look newer if you want more power. And if you're concerned about safety, don't be... there are more air bags in the newer models than bodies have places to fly in an accident. Audi drove me crazy with all its safety literature -- if safety is your concern, just read an Audi brochure. 

I spent the better part of a year looking for just the right car. After driving the A4 for about a year, I can confidently say the wait was definitely worth it. Stop looking and buy this car. 

P.S. -- For all you west-coast softies like me that don't drive in east-coast-style inclement weather but like a warm seat in the wintertime, get the seat warmers... you'll thank me later. ;)<br><br>
