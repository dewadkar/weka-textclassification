            I bought the Honda Civic because it is so fun to drive.  And best of all, it is very fuel efficient and has great looks!  What I like about the Civic is that the steering wheel rotates 360 x 2.5 degrees.  That's more than to complete circles of turning ability.  So when you bust a U-turn, you know that you'll be able to make it in one try and not block traffic by going on reverse.  And now the Civic looks better than ever.  Its old big lights have been shaped to be aerodynamic and the rear lights are just red and white, so you don't have to change the yellow blinker, which most people do.

The Civic is a fun to drive car.  It's small and compact and makes you feel at home in it.  But the rear passengers may have trouble getting comfortable in that cramped back seat.  The ride is smooth and quiet, and you can go miles on out with it.  I would recommend the Civic to anyone because of it's low price and great fuel economy.  Drivers will also enjoy the good handling and quiet ride.<br><br>
