                   The honda civic will get you where you want to go comfortably. The space inside the car is roomy. The seats are very &quot;cushy&quot; thus enhancing comfort. Smokers are out of luck because the Civic does not come with a cigarette lighter. Oh well. The steering on the civic is a little tight, but nothing that could prove to be detrimental to driving. The civic handles very well in all types of conditions whether it be a clear day or a violent thunder storm. Packing a four cylinder engine, the civic doesn't have the pick up like the jetta or the protege. But the Honda civic is actually a peppy little car. Prices ranging around 13,000g's, the civic proves to be a very reliable and fun car to drive for a great price.<br><br>
