            I have owned my Honda prelude for almost a year now, and I have yet to find anything that is really wrong with the car.  I have owned several H
ondas before my prelude, ('93 Honda Accord coupe, '95 Honda Civic coupe, '88 CRX) my Prelude is by far the best.  It gets good gas mileage for a sports car, and it keeps up with newer cars.  With a little money and an imagination you can take your stock car and turn it into a really nice looking high performance sports car.  The only con to this car is that there is virtually no back seat or any cup holders, but Honda didn't engineer this car to be a family sedan.
