            Okay, people buy SUV's for lots of reasons. Some are the proverbial soccer mom types that need space for kids, groceries, dogs, etc...  But I for one bought the Mercedes ML320 because I liked the way it looked. Sure it has the room I need to pack my stroller and baby stuff; but let's face it - the Kia Sportage would do as well for room. I also liked the security I felt riding in one of the most glamorous of all SUV's. It says, &quot;I am rugged, but i have no callous's on my paper pushing hands.&quot; I use the term rugged relatively speaking because 99 percent of it's usage is for groceries and dog food. 

I realize these monsters of the road are not specifically made for &quot;city driving&quot;, but look around and that's where you will find the highest concentration. I only have one major beef with the ML 320; where are the cup holders??? German engineering has left us wondering if drinking ANY type of beverage is the key to bad luck in auto-karma. I could not believe that after paying $39,000.00 for my new ride, I couldn't buy and enjoy a Big Gulp AND be on a road trip all at the same time. 

My family and I have been banished to the world of convenience store drink holders that fashionably clip to either the window of my Mercedes, or on the center console. I cannot understand - is the ML320 forgetful or just efficient; you decide...<br><br>
