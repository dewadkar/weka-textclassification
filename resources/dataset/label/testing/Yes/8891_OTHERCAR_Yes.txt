               Overall, I have greatly enjoyed my Spyder. It provides a comfortable ride and drive for the two in the front. Like I said... keep it at that and it is wonderful. This little car can really pick up and go also. 
  I drove mine down the coast line in July. It was breathtaking. This is my first convertible and it is won't be my last. I really could do without the occasional wet seat. I have talked to other owners and the complain of the same problem. I keep a pair of towels in the trunk so I can protect my seats in case I go out on a rainy night.
  Although it may leak once in a blue moon, and be cramped for more then two... I would not give it up for anything. I am extremely impressed with it. 
  My only warning would be to haggle over the price before you test drive it. Once you've driven it, top down, wind in your hair, you will not be able to say &quot;no&quot;.
  It is the ultimate car for a young bachelor like myself, but the insurance isn't very forgiving.
