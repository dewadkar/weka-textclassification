                The Porsche 911 is, in the $65000 to $100,000 price range, in a class by itself.  No other world-class sports car remotely resembles, compares or competes with it. Accept no substitutes; some may soon be discontinued.
    And, without laboring the obvious, this means forget the Boxster.  It is a visually pleasing little toy known as the Poor Man's Substitute. 
    The only real questions for you to consider are which of several  options to take.  They are, in no particular order, as follows:  Turbo or not, 4 wheel drive or not, convertible or coupe, manual or automatic, and a host of other intermediate, non-structural extras.
    With the turbo option, the issue is the extra initial and greater maintenance cost versus the benefit of the greater acceleration/engine response.  For racing purists, there is nothing to debate; they opt for turbo.  For all others, the added value seems negligible--like gilding the lilly. As for the 4 wheel drive option, it goes to the opposite, unnecessary extreme: Why sacrifice the car you purchased precisely for its speed to gain greater road handling? The convertible or coupe issue involves considerations which have nothing with the car being a Porsche. On the other hand, the &quot;stick&quot; issue has everything to do with it being a Porsche: If you're even thinking of buying the Tiptronic, buy a Lexus instead. For extras, consider traction control, leather seats, 18&quot; wheels and a hifi/stereo upgrade, bearing in mind the ever-changing state of the art as to the latter. Avoid the Savannah Beige interior; it will cheapen the appearance of your car. Finally, a Black exterior makes the car look smaller.  <br><br>
