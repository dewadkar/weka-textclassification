            I bought my DeVille because I had a Eldorado before it.  When my Eldorado
died, with 178,000 miles, I was heart-broken.  But it had served me well
and maintenance on it had been minimal.  
I went into the dealership to see what they had on hand for used vehicles,
hoping to find another Eldorado.  But they were more than I wanted to pay.
While looking around I came across this beautiful dark cherry red DeVille
sitting there calling my name.  It was a '95 with 60,000 miles, no nicks,
no dents, the inside in perfect condition and it was within my price range.  So I gave it a test drive.  It was wonderful!  
I drive Cadillac's because of the feeling of security.  I feel safe in my car.  When I get in, put the key in the ignition the doors automatically lock.  Someone cannot come along and jump in at a light because you have not locked the doors.  If someone is going to hit me I have more car between me and them.  It feels solid.  I don't feel as though I'm sitting in a little tin can.  You can definitely feel the difference in the ride.
It's smoother and you don't feel like your bumping down the road. My car &quot;talks&quot; to me.  It tells me how much oil life I have left and when I need to change the oil.  No more trying to keep track of the milage or if it's been three months since I changed the oil.  
Now let's talk about the dealership.  When I take my car into the dealer-
ship, they treat me with courtesy and respect.  They listen to what I have to say.  When my Eldorado was sick, before it died, the dealership had my car picked up and put on a flatbed and carried to the dealership.  They then gave me a ride home.  The next morning they gave me a ride to work, called me during the day to tell me how my car was coming along and picked me up after work and brought me back to the dealership to get my car.  Service, to me, is very important.
Many people would probably say they can't afford a Cadillac.  I say you need to look before making that decision.  I thought I couldn't afford one before I first went in and found my Eldorado.  But to my surprise, I found I could.  The service and maintenance are far less than I had paid on some of the smaller new cars I had purchased and driven.
