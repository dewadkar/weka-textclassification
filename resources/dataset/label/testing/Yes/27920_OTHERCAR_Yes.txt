            I bought this camera after agonizing about what kind, etc... because I had no idea what to look for.  So, I looked at ebay, and cross-referenced prices, and got this puppy for 127.00 shipped!  The only thing I had to worry about was that I had no warranty with it, so I did want to make sure and baby this camera.  Soooo, (you with kids know exactly what's coming up) my 18 mo. old, pitched it down from our 3rd floor--15 steps!  This camera is built SO durable, that it sustained absolutely no damage!!  After I learned how to use the software, it was easier to download, etc...  The picture quality is wonderful.  One especially nice feature that i like, and I don't know if other digital cams have this or not, is that there is a slide button to use for close up images, so you can get really good detail.  I just love this camera!
