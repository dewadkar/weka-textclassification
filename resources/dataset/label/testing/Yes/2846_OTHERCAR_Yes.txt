            Prior to buying my Prelude, I owned a '91 Honda CRX.  It was the best car I have ever owned, but it was 8 years old and time to purchase something new.  When I bought the CRX I wasn't making a lot of money and in my 20's, now in my late-30's, I decided to buy something a bit more expensive and sophisticated.  Having had great experience' with Honda's (my 4th), I decided to stick with a good thing.  I looked @ the Accord Coupe, but decided it was too popular.  Honda made the bad decision to discontinue the CRX, so the Prelude was my only real choice outside of an Integra, which we already own (a '96 Special Edition).  I bought the base model Prelude with a 5 speed tranny because I wanted the extra 5 horses the manual has over the auto (200 vs. 195 bhp). I also didn't want the trick suspension the Type SH comes with. I got the &quot;puke&quot; green as I saw it referred to in another '99 Prelude review. Its actually a dark metallic green, which I think looks good, but it does show dirt.

I guess I bought this car too late in life. No doubt about it, it is a great car to own, if your about 22, single and short. Living in a large city (Houston) with dreadful traffic, the 5 speed (though sweet) has been a poor choice. In the City, I rarely get out of 3rd gear because of the heavy traffic, so the constant shifting and clutch work grows tiresome. Quickly. 

Inside, the front seats are comfortable (firm &amp; supportive)in a grippy/sturdy black fabric.  You have a choice of interior colors as long as its black. Switch gear and instruments are clear and have that great &quot;quality&quot; feel to them.  Considering the price of this car, it would be nice to have had automatic climate control(which you can get it in an Accord Coupe!). The air conditioning and heat perform well, although the switchgear design is an older looking slider design vs knobs.

Getting into and out of the car isn't easy for my 39 year old body. The drivers seat comes with a manual height adjuster, which I have found to be useless since headroom is lacking no matter how I adjust the seat. 

With the 5 speed, if you have anything other than a small can in the cup holder(s), the drink will be in the way of shifting the gears.  I always end up putting the drink between my legs!
 
The back seat is not as bad as your told in most reviews (as long as your under 5'8). Getting in and out of it is a chore, but the front passenger seat slides forward to allow easier entry. There is even 1 cup holder back there! 

The base stereo CD sounds great to me!

The option list for this car is very limited. It comes standard with what I consider the basic &quot;luxury&quot; items, power windows, locks, mirrors, and moonroof. However, it would have been nice to have the option of getting leather, the previously mentioned automatic climate control, a garage door opener in the visor and side airbags (all of which are available on the less expensive Accord and Accord Coupe), but you don't have the ability to order any of these + it would probably push the car into the 30's in price!  

Truck space is good (considering) and you can lay the back seat down providing even more room. 
 
Handling is this cars forte. Its ride is above par for a small sporty car, and it feels stable on most road surfaces.  Road noise is fairly limited and much less than in our Integra.

I like the exterior design.  I love the front end design, especially the headlights. Side profile is good too, its low and sleek and the alloy wheels are sharp (not hard to clean either)! The rear view is the exterior's let down.  Its not ugly, just really plain.

The exterior sheet metal FEELS very delicate. I am careful not to park it near other cars for fear of getting door dings. The paint is easily marred by rocks, etc.. 

A few quality issues have surprised me with my car.  The weather stripping around the windshield is constantly coming out of place.  I have taken it to the dealer on more than one occasion.  All they do is put tape on it and let it sit in the sun, which never works for long. 

My &quot;H&quot; on the back trunk feels like it could fall off @ any minute.

It rattles! Rattles began cropping up shortly after I bought it. This is the first Honda I have ever owned that has rattled this bad. I have taken it back to the dealer three times, first they oiled the moonroof gear, then attempted to tighten the PLASTIC (on a 25k car!)roof liner. Last time, they changed the back left strut. Now the same sound is coming from the right rear!

These are all minor nit picks that have added up to a somewhat less than stellar ownership experience to date in the 25 months since I bought the car off the dealer lot.
  
Who should buy this car?  If your young and your parents can afford one for you...buy it.  If your looking for something a bit more sophisticated, I would recommend the new Acura 3.2 CL, Type S or or Accord Coupe V6 EX.
