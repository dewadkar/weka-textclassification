            Well, those of you who have read my other reviews know I am also the proud owner of a Saturn SC1 coupe from the 2000 model year. Why would I need a second car? Well, the answer is a lot more complex than it might seem. Evidently, when trying to be an unobtrusive reporter and simply observe events, the SC coupe is not the best car to be driving.

It attracts attention, much more than I or my boss am comfortable with. The obvious solution was to rent a car, but that started to get expensive, so I looked around for an older used car that would blend in and be almost unnoticeable. That is when I found my 1992 Acura Legend LS.

This was a luxury car in 1992, and is still fairly well-equipped for an average sedan of 2002. It comes standard with an AM/FM cassette radio, eight-way power driver's seat, power windows, automatic transmission (LS model only), leather seats, front cupholder, 16-inch wheels, ABS disc brakes, the Acura anti-theft system, a four-speaker setup by a generic brand, CD-changer ready (Alpine changers preferred by the manufacturer), power windows and locks, and front-wheel drive.

When I purchased this car, it had 112,000 miles on the odometer but still ran like it had a mere 40,000. The handling is wonderful and the suspension is high-quality, even after the wear-and-tear on the car from the previous owner. In addition, the anti-lock brakes have saved my life at least once after getting cut off in traffic on the highway.

The gas mileage is decent after ten years, but the real complaint is that given how much gas costs around where I live, having to buy premium is somewhat off-putting. But as one of two flaws I've found with this car, I can deal. 

The other problem is that this car rides a good six inches lower to the ground than any other car I've seen on the road, and I can't offer any explanation, though I'm sure the Acura styling engineers have their take on it. As it is, I've mashed the bumper up on occasion when I don't remember how low the car rides, but the well-built frame minimizes the visible damage.

Aside from that, the other advantages include ample trunk space and room in both the front and back seats, including power seat adjustment for the driver (eight-way, no less...a wonderful touch). Also, the sound system that was included stock is actually above and beyond what one might expect from a factory standard - it even came ready for a CD changer, a six-disc Alpine that was my only addition to the car when I purchased it. 

Actually, what's more is that not only was the stereo ready to take a CD changer, the cord used to connect it was already present, meaning I did not have to go digging around inside the wiring to run a new wire from trunk to dash.

Furthermore, the leather inside the car is very nice and gives it a luxury feel even on a used car. My only complaint is that it is black, and given how hot the Northern Illinois summers are, I often have to throw a towel over the seats just to make it habitable. However, that is only one more minor complaint on a car with many major advantages.

<b>In conclusion...</b>

In conclusion, this car is a wonderful value and serves the purposes I need with an exceptional degree of success. It is an excellent secondary or primary car and can be enjoyed by many ranges of people. The fact that it has decent gas mileage and handles well as an aging car speaks volumes to the degree of care with which it was originally constructed. I cannot speak to the new generation of Acura Legends (now the TL or RL, I believe) but I have ample evidence that states the older generation represents some of the best products to roll off the assembly line in a long, long while.
