            My husband and I owned a Dodge 1500 4wd a few years ago.  The ONLY reason we got rid of it was because it was a 3 seater, and we decided to have another baby.  Thus, we needed a bigger vehicle.
We owned our truck for 2 years and never had one single problem with it.  The ride was smooth, handled very easily and the seats were extremely comfortable.  I am very short, and I was able to reach the pedals and see over the steering wheel at the same time-anyone who is very short can relate to that!
The only time we ever had it in the shop was for oil changes, regular tune ups and to have the tires rotated.
We live in PA and we had our truck during the blizzard in January of '96.  We were the only ones on our block who were able to get out and around.  Which was extremely important as I was due to deliver our baby 2 days after the blizzard hit-so we needed to be able to get to the hospital.  (sorry, no blizzard birth stories here, the baby came late!).
The only con I can think of is that the Dodge does tend to eat gas quickly if you do a lot of city driving.
Bottom line is, we plan on saving to buy the Dodge extended cab.  We found it very reliable and would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
