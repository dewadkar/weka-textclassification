            We have a very bad feeling about the Jimmy's air bag.  My husband was in a accident with his 2 door Jimmy.  He was sitting a a stop light when another driver ran a red light and hit him head on, the clocked this other driver at about 40-45 mph.  The other driver hit our Jimmy right on the M and the C on the front grill of the truck, and to the drivers side.  The air bag however did not deploy as it should have.  Thank god my husband is still around.  When talking with the body shop where the vehicle was fixed and GM the only answer they could give me was, he wasnt' hit in the right spot on the truck for the air bag to deploy.  

I didn't know that you had to drive around with an X marks the spot in order to have your air bags deploy when you are hit head on.  

I feel as if GM and the dealer where our truck was fixed thought that they could pull  that answer over my head because I am female.  

Over all we liked the Jimmy until we had the accident, the air bag issue is a very scary to us.  

I would suggest if you plan to buy this vehicle that you ask some questions about the air bags and if they have to be hit at a certain place to deploy.
