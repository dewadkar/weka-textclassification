            This has been one of the best purchases I have made, the jeep is constantly evolving, when I purchased the vehicle it was completely stock and like new, had only 40,000 miles in 96.  I have built it into a truck that turns heads where ever I go and can keep up with or pass any short wheelbase jeep (CJ, YJ, or TJ) on the trail.  I takes a different breed of person to use a vehicle that is very soft and flexy (lifted 11" over stock) as a daily driver, I have had some problems with both engine and steering controls but nothing that was not expected after using the truck offroad for at least 1500 miles a year for 3 years, in addition to another 70,000 miles at freeway speeds and around town.  Only running complaint is the inability of any cherokee to stay cool, running radiator temps of 212+ is not uncommon. My recommendation which goes for buying any slightly older jeep would be be prepared to get your hands dirty and pay attention to the car so you can catch any issues earlier before they cause big problems.  Then again I have a 42' and 43' WWII Willys MB's that were a mess when I got them so that is half the fun, so long as it is in the shop and not laying in the mud on the trail...
