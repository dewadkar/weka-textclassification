            This is a very nice car.  The Sable is a very good family car. I have a Sable and love the car.  I haven't had to do any repairs on the car what so ever, and don't think that I will need to for a long time.  This is a good car for someone that has a family.  It is a very roomy car on the inside but it's a big old boat.  There is a lot of trunk room in it also.  This hasn't happened to me on this car, but a lot of Mercury will have electric problems with them.  It has happened to the last car that I had and also to my parents Mercury.  That is really the only problem that I find with buying this car.<br><br>
