            I bought my car when I got my orders transferring me to a Navy base in the High Desert of California...in the middle of the Mojave, a car was a requirement if you wanted to get anywhere! I had researched all sorts of cars and ended up with the Saturn and I'm glad I did!  
 
It was the weekend before Christmas, I took the 3 hour drive  down to LA to go to Disneyland and see the tree since I was staying on the base and didnt have a tree of my own.  I was driving back Sunday night and took a twisty cutoff road...I crested a hill and was met with headlights in my lane!! I swerved out of the way and the right side of the car dropped off the blacktop into the sand, I swerved back onto the road and started to spin, the next thing I knew I was flying through the air end over end! The car landed on its roof and skidded across the road and when it hit the sand on the other side it flipped back onto its wheels.
 
The airbag deployed somewhere along the way and between that and my seatbelt I was able to walk away!! Another car came along a short while after the accident and the gentleman went and found a phone and called for help...I was taken to the hospital just to make sure everything was ok and they sent me home. 

When I went to the tow yard the next day the guys couldnt believe I'd been in the car that was currently on a FLATBED because it couldnt be towed!! The car was a complete mess...the rear windshield was gone, the front shattered, the frame twisted, the mirrors gone...BUT there was NO intrusion into the passenger compartment!  Even after flipping over and skidding on the roof, the &quot;crumple zone&quot; worked perfectly and protected me, the sunroof was scraped but didnt break! 
 
I can't say enough about this car...Even before the accident I loved it, it was reliable, zippy, fuel efficient, service was EASY. 
 
I love my Saturn and just regret that I havent needed to replace it!<br><br>
