            I'll cover the following items,
1- Alero description of vehicle.
2- My experience driving the Alero.
3- Some of the cons of the Alero.
4- Summary

1- Mine is a 2001 Midnight blue, 4dr Alero GLS with the 1SA package. It has a 3.4L V6 with 4 wheel disk brakes, 16in. tires, polished alloy wheels, fog lights, neutral Leather interior, remote keyless entry, premium 8 speaker CD/Cassette sound system,  all speed traction control, tire inflation monitoring system, pwr door locks, pwr windows, theft deterrent system, and more standard! This car is built for driving fun!
2. I have had to commute about 180 miles a day, five days a week, for the last 9 months so I've spent more time in this car than some people. I believe this gives me some good impressions of what this car is like to own and drive. First off, I enjoy the power that comes from having 170 horse power available to you. In traffic, having the extra kick gives you the confidence you need to handle I-5 rush hour traffic. The 4 wheel disk brakes with Anti-lock Braking give you added comfort. If you have to stop, you will be able to with control. I averaged about 29 mpg due to the highway speeds I drive (65-70mph). I have not had any mechanical difficulties to date. The seating is not like a luxurious Aurora or Lincoln Town Car. However this car has ample room for two adults and two children if you have them. The car handles tight like I think it should. It is responsive and easy to drive. The CD/Cassette 8 spkr sound system is awesome! I listen to my music during my commute and it rocks!
3. The cup holder/ashtray is a joke. I often wonder how they got away with putting it in front of the gear shift, which is a T-shifter on the console between the seats. Maybe some day they will get it out of that awful spot (Olds are you listening?). Additionally, there is a bad blind spot on each side of the Alero which you must be aware of prior to making any lane changes. This is solved by ensuring you actually look carefully in the direction which you are changing lanes to PRIOR to moving over. The mirrors do not cover your blind spot. Also, the Alero is not the quietest car ever built. I notice that on I-5 in and around Seattle that the road is built with low grade concrete which means you get a rough ride to begin with. Add the tight ride of the Alero and you get a rather noisy ride. I play my stereo alot but that is still something Olds should fix sooner rather than later. With the price you are paying you should get a quieter ride.
4. Yes, you can get a better car, Camry, Altima to name just a few. But to you I say this. Which car is made (mostly) in the USA? Which one has all the luxury items STANDARD? Which one has the 60,000 mile, 5yr warrant available? Lastly, which was is the most affordable? I believe you will find the Alero to be a great buy for your money. The Bottom line? This car is definitely not your Dad's Oldsmobile. Get one while the getting is good and enjoy!
