            Honda CR-V 2001 EX

Nothing Has Changed...

... between the 2000 and 2001 CR-V and why should it. This pocket size SUV is a winner for Honda so why make any changes.

The model I test drove is the EX. It comes equipped standard with a column mounted 4-speed automatic transmission.   On the LX model the automatic transmission is an option.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

I like to describe the Honda CR-V as a pocket size SUV. It is certainly not one of these huge monsters that are all over the roads and only serve a purpose of impressing the Jones.

This SUV is for the active outdoors types that really does not need to do much off-roading. The engine is a small 
2-liters, 4-cylinders engine that develops only 146 horsepower. So if you are looking for power, better look somewhere else.

The CR-V is not fully pack with lots of standard features but options are available to satisfy each new owner.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

For thing I noticed after I opened the driver&#146s side door is that nothing fancy is in the CR-V, by this I mean no leather seats nor leather covered steering. But I also noticed that the workmanship is excellent. 

From the driver&#146s seat you will have an excellent front, rear and side vision. I usually make a fuss about small side view mirrors on trucks and SUV, but the CR-V is so under power that the maximum towing capacity is only at 1,000 pounds. This means that you can only pull a small trailer and the mirrors it comes with should do the job.

From the driver&#146s seat you have an excellent view of all the gauges and all the control buttons are within easy reach of the driver.

The front head and legroom is adequate, for the rear seat passengers if you plan to travel with large adults they might feel a bit squeezed in in the back.

The CR-V EX comes equipped with the following standard features: 4-speed automatic transmission, air conditioning, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, AM/FM radio with CD player and rear window defrost.

As optional equipment you can add a luggage rack, which as far as I am concern is a must on any SUV, and also add alloy wheels.

The exterior:

Of course this is a matter of taste but to me the exterior appearance of the CR-V is less than appealing.  But a vehicle does not have to be pretty to do the job and anyone who buys a CR-V that is aware of its power limitation should be well served by it.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Honda CR-V Ex I test drove had the following under the hood:

Engine: A 2-liters, 4-cylinders motor that develops 146 horsepower at 6200 RPM.
Transmission: A 4-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: Front disc and rear drums with ABS.
Tires: 205/70R15
Safety: Driver and front passenger airbags.
            Child safety locks.
            Keyless remote entry.  
 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Well with only 146 horsepower you will not be thundering down the highway, but if you are looking for a well built utility vehicle and power is not a must than the Honda CR-V could be an option.
