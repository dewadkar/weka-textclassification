I still can't believe i bought this camera for myself, it seems ridiculous to me that i spent 450 on a simple digital camera. It's true: i'm going away soon and i want to remember everything i go through and send it to my friends and stuff like that, but god, 450 for a picture taker? Ick..

I've talked to a few people who know something about camera's of this sort and they recommended i buy this one, because it's new, it's Pentax, a name supposedly quite respected in the digital camera nerds circle.

I now know something too about DC, and what i know and aware of i will comment on.

First thing first: mega pixels. basically the bigger the number, the better the quality of yer pictures will be. This camera posses a magnificent 4.0 MP, which as far as i know is tops in digital cameras.

5x optical zoom is awesome, because most digital cameras have only 2x or max 3x zoom, so obviously this one takes the cake.

The max resolution on thisx camera is 2288-1712, which is very good and your pictures will look as crisp and sharp as anything, maybe they'll look even sharper than actual life, because sometimes life can look blurry, eg. when you're drunk, hehehe.

The interface for the camera is USb which is mad easy to use and employ. All you do is plug the cable in and slug away, download what you want, edit etc. It all takes mere seconds. Plus USB ports are found in almost any desktop or laptop, so you shouldn't have much problems with that.

The memory card is 16 MB which is quite alright, since most cameras have about 8-12, so you'll be a winner here cause you'll have more.

Another neat thing about the camera is that it can record movies with sound. Most cameras can, but this one can pull off a ten minute movie, which is absolutely super.

Basically this camera doesn't do much of others do, but it does all the same things better and fits more stuff inside, meaning more images and movies for you, with better quality and longer battery life. 

Cons: obviously the price, but then it's worth it.

Here are some specifications for you.
