            I originally bought the Kodak 260, which had more features.  But, it was so complicated, I couldn't even take a picture!  So, I exchanged it for this one.  This one is perfect for me.  When you have a three year old running around, simple is good.  I like the easy switch on the back with clear directions such as &quot;capture&quot; and &quot;review&quot; and &quot;preferences&quot; also &quot;connect&quot;.  They say exactly what they mean.  And on the little screen, a picture of the function is great.  For example, a little trash can on the picture means delete.  Makes great sense to me.  I also like the &quot;zoom&quot; or &quot;close up&quot; feature that is on the 210, but not the 220. In this feature, it shows on the screen what the picture would look like. For any other picture, you just look through the viewfinder, and look and your picture AFTER, but with zoom you look before you take it.  The only thing that I really DON'T like about this camera are two things.  The first one is how hard it is to hold.  If you try to hold it like a normal camera, you'll put your thumb right on the screen.  The other thing is how it's nearly impossible to figure out how to plug it into the tv.  I've got the directions, and I still have never been able to look at my pictures on my television like it says I can.  My other idea for improvement would be for Kodak to develop a perfectly sized battery thing that works like the Black and Decker rechargables, pop it out and put it in-- but they're not actually batteries!<br><br>
