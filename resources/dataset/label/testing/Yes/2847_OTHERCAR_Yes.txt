            It's here. The new, fifth generation Honda Prelude is at dealerships now. You can see thoughts of this beauty running through your mind faster than a speeding bullet. The Honda Prelude is well equipped with many goodies including engine features, safety features, and optional accessories. This car has it all you expect from a sport-compact. It has a strong 2.2L DOHC VTEC engine with a bit over 200 hp. This wonderful car is quick when it comes to accelleration and top speed. It is an undescribable experience to drive such a great car. It's sleek design gives you that &quot; I want to race&quot; feeling. But this car does not come at an easy price, they might hurt your piggy bank a little. But it is definitely worth the performance. By adding on a couple more minor engine modifications, you can easily push this car to 250 hp. But if not, 200 is very good number to have your Horsepower range. I personally had a very good experience with this car. However, it is mainly meant as a two seater, rather than a four. Although, it has four seats, only the two front seats can sit two people comfortably. I highly recommend this vehicle to those sport-compact car lovers.<br><br>
