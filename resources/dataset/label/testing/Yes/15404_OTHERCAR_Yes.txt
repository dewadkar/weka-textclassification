            I bought this camera a year ago to take pictures of things I sell on Ebay.I was very impressed with the macro feature.This is a must for taking super close up pictures of things like proof marks,serial numbers ect.Not only do I use it for selling,I use it for all my photo taking on trips as well as around home.The camera uses floppy disc's and that is great,imagine how many floppy's you can carry in your pocket,and when you download them on your computer, you can erase them and start all over again.I can't imagine how much money I have saved by printing my own photo's and not buying film or paying for developing.I recommend this camera highly as with all Sony equipment.<br><br>
