            I love everything about my D-340R. The resolution is higher than I'm ever going to need in a digital picture, and there are more features than I'll ever use.

The one thing that stuck out to me about this camera was the amount of features in it. The coolest thing that I've seen is the photo mosaic. You take a series of pictures and the camera will automatically combine them to form a mosaic.

The camera doesn't use much power at all. on a good set of batteries I get ~500 pictures out of them using the lcd.

Resolutions go up to 1280x960 which is more than I or most people will ever need.

If you're buying a new digital camera, the D-360R is the one I would reccomend. Very cheap and has just about every feature under the sun.<br><br>
