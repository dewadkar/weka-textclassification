            A pleasant surprise awaited me at the service center.  Upon dropping off my new Camaro Z-28 for service I was given a free loaner for a week.  While this is not unusual, I had spotted a long row of new Impalas outside and was resigned to relinquishing my fun to drive vehicle for one of these ultra practical Impalas.  When the service man said I would get a Buick I was intrigued.  When I steeped outside to see a new Buick Park Avenue a smile swept across my face.

A Buick Park Avenue is a car I tend to forget exists.  I am a hardcore car enthusiast and the only Buicks that have recently caught my attention were the stunning but now extinct Riviera and the nations fastest rental car, the Regal GS (try one for a weekend).  The only time in recent memory I even thought about the Park Avenue was when I was discussing car design with a twenty some year old car designer who mentioned one of his favorite new cars was the Park Avenue!!  I initially thought he was kidding but he was dead serious and it made me think twice about the Park Avenue.

At first my appreciation for the Buick was due to the intrigue of driving a vehicle that seemed so remote from my self image.  I hoped people would see me in this big car and assume I was either the most conservative semi-affluent thirty four year old in the world or a car thief or something.  As I stopped at traffic signals I looked for  reactions to my obvious automotive to demographic mismatch, but to my surprise nobody noticed.  As time wore on I became quite comfortable driving the big Buick.  In fact I hardly noticed I was driving.  All the controls were intuitive, there was no engine noise, no steering feedback, no noticeable blind spots, no uncomfortable lumps or bumps in the seat, no in your face interior design elements, just simple pleasing shapes and all the comforts and conveniences I could imagine needing.

While I yearn to drive my Camaro, shifting through the six gears and listening to the V8 rumble, there are times I just want to get to my destination or take a relaxing trip with my wife holding hands and talking.  This is what a Buick Park Avenue is for.  

My usual first inspection of a rental or loaner car involves popping the hood and seeing what is motivating me.  The Park Avenue did not beckon me there.  Instead I noticed the taught fender creases inspired by the artful Riviera, the prominent Buick grille, and the unmistakable mass of a traditional American car.  I liked it.  I do recall reading that the base Park Avenue is powered by Buicks efficient and durable 3.8 litre V6 and I found the performance to be acceptable (the supercharged Ultra would probably please me more).  What amazed me was the gas mileage.  I averaged 26 MPG!  

The spacious interior went mostly unused, but I did sit in the back long enough to gauge the ample dimensions, and I popped a few grocery bags in the huge trunk.  It looked like a four golf bag capacity.

My overall opinion of the big Buick continually improved during my week with the car and I can honestly say I would consider buying one.  I believe the current rebates are substantial and the car is priced quite reasonably to begin with.  I have to say this is a car to try out even if you do not see yourself driving a throwback to the big American cars of the past.
