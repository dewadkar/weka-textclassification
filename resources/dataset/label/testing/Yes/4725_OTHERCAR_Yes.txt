            The time had finally come to step up in the world of digital cameras.  My wife and I had been using a 2.1 megapixel Olympus D-510.  We'd gotten great use out of it the past couple years but wanted to step up.

Our requirements:
- 4 megapixel
- no bigger than the old Olympus D-510 (not hard)
- ability to compose a shot by controlling ISO, flash, etc
- sturdy!
- less than $400

After alot of time spent researching option online, the A80 consistently came up with solid reviews.  So the wife and I headed to Best Buy to check it out.  It felt great, but the real neat thing was the flip out and rotate screen (like a video camera).

As we were fresh off a trip from Vegas, we remembered what it was like trying to take a picture of us together by holding the camera out at arms length and guessing as to whether or not we were in frame.  Not with this baby...

Anyway - the price there was $399 before tax and that only included a little old useless 32MB flash card.

So I went online shopping and found a deal for the camera  new in box with a 128 MB card for a total price of about $343.  SOLD

Now it just came in yesterday, but I've done nothing but take pictures around the house with it since then.

AMAZING - the colors are vibrant and easily captured.  You have the ability to customize your setting for an indoor shot that the old camera just didn't have.  I've found that I no longer am compromising between a yellowed out shot from the lights or a white washed shot from too much flash.

I did manage to run through the batteries that the camera came with in under 24 hours.  But I really was using the display ALOT.

Not a problem though as the old camera used some rechargable AA batteries that I can use in this camera as well.

As for the build, I love the fact that when the camera is off and the screen is put away, you needn't worry about scratching stuff up.

It also feels great in my hand - I guess this means it's easy for me to hold it, balance it, and take a shot.  Now we did look at the Elphs, but they were too small for me to feel comfortable holding while taking a shot. 

It's a great camera that takes clean and easy shots, plus with a little online leg work you can easily find this camera at or below $350.
