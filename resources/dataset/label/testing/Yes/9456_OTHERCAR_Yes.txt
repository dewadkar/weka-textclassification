            I wanted a truck but needed one with room.  The quad cab was a perfect find!  The 4 doors makes it easy for adults and children to get in and out of the backseat.  The backseat is a little cramped for bigger adults but is made up by with the easy of getting in and out.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  I couldn't believe it was a truck I was driving, the ride was so smooth!  The console is very user friendly with everything right at your fingertips.  The middle storage compartment is roomy and has room for just about everything from pens to a cellular phone to a laptop computer.  The engine is a V8, 5.9 magnum and is powerful!  The down side to it is the gas mileage.  I get around 10 mpg city and 12 mpg highway.  If you are looking for a truck that is roomy and drives and handles like a car, then try the Dodge Ram quad cab.<br><br>
