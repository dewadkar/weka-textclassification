            We bought an Odyssey to replace a 1987 Volvo 740, as we found our sedan overburdened by the taxi and hauling demands of our growing family.  It doesn't have the oomph our Volvos have, but the space is heavenly.  Reconfigurable seating makes the Odyssey go from bus to truck functions easily, and there are many intelligent features I've become accustomed to in higher-end cars like Volvo and Mercedes.  Another benefit of the seating is that I can walk into the far-back seat easily without leaving the van - most parents of three-year-olds will appreciate that.  My biggest surprise was that it doesn't drive like a truck, but rather a large and moderately peppy sedan.  The coolest thing about it is the James-Bond like power rear sliding doors that can be operated with the remote.  I can let the kids out of the van and then close the doors again just by pushing a button!  
I still hate that it's a minivan, but it's a real pleasure to use for lots of passengers and large cargos.<br><br>
