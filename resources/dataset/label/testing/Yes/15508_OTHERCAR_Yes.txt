            I currently own a Silverstone Performance 350Z 6-speed.  After over a year of ownership I feel I can now write an honest review about this car.  The Z is the kind of sports car that other automakers should strive to create.  Power, stunning exterior design and athletic handling for the price of a fully loaded Camry or Accord.  

Driving the car, I immediately noticed how precise the steering was.  287 Horsepower really gives the car some go, and even at 130 mph (155 limited) the car is really stable.  During spirited driving, the car is very nimble considering its 3300 lb curb weight.  Some slight understeer at the limit.  Braking is very good but fades with extreme use (Track Model Brembos will fare much better).  

The interior is spartan but has a jet cockpit-like feel.  Cloth seats are comfortable and are well bolstered.  I would caution that guys over 6' 2" may not fit so well in this car.  The radio leaves something to be desired, but I end up spending more time listening to the exhaust note which is just heavenly.  Strut bar in the rear is functional but also restricts storage capacity.  The cigarette lighter is strangely placed behind the driver (fixed in the 04 model).  Visibility through the rear view is like looking at a widescreen movie.  Blind spots may be blocks by headrests.

On the exterior, the car is simply amazing from any angle.  Great curb appeal and very eye-catching.  

Now for the not-so-good:

The 03 model is a first year production run. Mine in particular is a pre-order.  Like many first year cars, it has its share or quirks.  Thankfully, nothing really serious regarding engine.  Here is a short list of what I know *could* be an issue on 03s.

*Uneven Tire Wear on Front Tires due to improper suspension/alignment settings. The only fix is to get a good alignment shop to do your alignment and get some coilovers.  Should be fixed as of 2004.5
*Transmission grinding on gear shift.  Very early models only.  Nissan replaces it through warranty.  *Make sure you push down ALL THE WAY on the clutch when shifting*
*Grease streak on the windows. Fixable through warranty.  No problem on later 03s
*Noisy AC. Fixable through warranty.  No problem on newer models.
*Bose improper Auto Volume Adjustment.  Fixable through warranty.  No problem on newer models.

See a trend?  My suggestion if you are looking for a Z is to buy a 2004 model.  I love my 350Z but it has some 'personality quirks' that only a diehard Z enthusiast can live with. :)

Finally, there is an oft debated question of which trim to get.  IMO there are only 3 ways of thinking on this car...

1) Tight Budget. No modification. Go with the Enthusiast model. HIDs, TCS, LSD, Cruise Control.  Best bang for your buck.  
2) No limit Budget.  No modification.  Go with the Track model.  Lightest rims, Best Brakes, HIDs, and the whole gambit of electronic traction control. 
3) No limit Budget.  Want to modify the car.  Go with the Base model. The LSD, VDC and TCS are all really safety features that you pay a lot for and they will screw up the car's telemetry if your tires are out of spec. There is a price difference of nearly 10K between base and track.  That's your rims|turbo|bodykit|brakes|lsd|hid etc. right there.

The Z still gets my heart pounding even after a year of ownership.  It is a dream to drive and perhaps the one car I would want to keep to the end of my days.  Overall, it gets 2 thumbs up from me (3 if I had another hand).
