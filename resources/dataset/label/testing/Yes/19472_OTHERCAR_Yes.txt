            I have had this camera for a little over a year now and it is still offering the great performance it always has been. since the moment it was taken out of the box it has been easy to use and has offered great quality photos to my family and I. The features this camera comes with are very useful also. You can change the brightness for shots in almost any light condition, and the 10x zoom allows you to take photos at a great range of distance.

 There is a focus on the side so you can produce as sharp a picture as possible. There is a flash for dark photos, and you can add picture effects. you can look at your pictures within 20 seconds of taking them by simply flipping a switch and searching the picture library.

 The camera saves pictures on 3.5&quot; floppy disks so you can easily transfer photos to almost any computer or other source. Each disk holds between 20 and 30 photos. Saving to a floppy disk comes in handy so you don't need to purchase a special port or printer that is compatible with a certain memory card format camera.  <br><br>
