            I recently just bought an Acura Integra 2 Dr Coupe LS. My reaction to it? I love it! This car is worth every penny spent on it. The sticker price on my car was 21500 which was not bad considering the car is 140 horse power which is excellent for its size and weight.

The car has excellent steering and turning control. I was able to easily manuveur the car any way or fashion I wanted. The handling was fantastic. The car also come with ABS system which is really good. You could stop on a dime with those brakes!

The color I got was Voltage Blue Metallic which only comes in the LS and GS model, not the GS-R. The color sort of resembles the Honda Civic SI coupe model. Inside the car was a lot of roomy space. The back was also very comfortable. The back chairs are easily put down to have more storage space for the trunk. Not like it needs it with the big room already in the back.

This car is easily fix up for accesories and excess parts to upgrade the performance. Many racers can buy parts fairly cheap for the Integra that will give it a lot of boost and power.

This car overall is very slick in its look and great on performance. Pound for Pound this car is excellent for anyone wanting to get the ultimate sports car feeling without dishing out the high cash.<br><br>
