Canon succeeds very well in hitting its target. This camera targets home and small-business users. With the Canon PowerShot A50. Almost small enough to hide in your hand, this inexpensive camera is simple to use, and captures good quality images. It's certainly good enough for Web posting, e-mail attachments, or family shots, but not quite good enough for framing or careful scrutiny. 

  The PowerShot has both an optical viewfinder and a 2-inch LCD that I find is bright enough for outside use. Although the camera control arrangement and markings were clear enough to let us take photos in fully automatic mode, I found that I needed to refer to the manual for information on using all of the unit's features. Two items of note that add to the PowerShot's convenience are a 15-exposure, continuous-shot mode (which captures images in 640-by-480 resolution) and an on-screen aid for taking panoramic shots that displays the last shot you took to assist in lining up successive ones. 

However compared to other cameras the Canon Powershot A50 doesnt rank as high. In its highest-resolution, lowest-compression mode, the PowerShot's printed output was not as clear as other cameras and lacked the three-dimensional quality most other cameras have. 

The Canon PowerShot A50 is a good choice for shots of family gatherings because of its small size, convenient design, and reasonable price. Its portability also makes it a good fit for general-purpose business applications. However, if your looking for a camera that will fill your professional needs this is not the one.
