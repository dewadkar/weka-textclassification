            The BMW 328i is one of the most luxurious and sporty vehicles out on the market right now.  Well the price is a bit steep, but what can you expect from a car that proudly wears a BMW badge.  The 193 horsepower 2.8 Inline-6 engine has a purr that will turn any individual into a BMW believer and lover.  Coupled with a 5-spd manual transmission, the 328i has strong power and a smooth gear shifts.  The interior cabin noise at a cruise of 70-80 mph is very low and quiet.  The optional kardon stereo system has great sound that can instantly turn the interior cabin into a surround sound theater.  Since three of my close friends actually drive 1999 and 2000 BMW 328i's, I have been able to test out all the features this BMW has to offer.  There is an optional rain sensor on this vehicle that detects rain drops on the windshield and automatically turns on the wiper system.  The heated seats also provide nice and toasty warmth on those extra cold days.  I would recommend the premium and sports package together.  The sports steering wheel has great grip and it also has the stereo control conveniently located on the steering handle.  The sports package gives you that sport suspension and shocks, and it has a lower stance that the base 328i.  The lower stance helps you corner better and handling is amplified positively.  The sport seats also have much better support and gives the vehicle and tight feel.  I especially like the pull out feature on the seat where you can extend the bottom cushion of the seat to give your legs more support.  The leather is soft and very comfortable.  It provides the comfort necessary for those long trips.  Even though this BMW may look a bit compact, the interior is extremely well designed.  The leg and head room are ample and even the rear passengers can comfortably sit and enjoy the ride!  The traction control on the 328i is very effective in the snow, even though this car is a rear wheel drive car, it handles better than most front wheel drive cars in inclement weather.  Passing trucks on the highway is a piece of cake for the 328i.  It can muscle from 70-90 mph with ease with no stress on the accelerator.  A good price for the 328i with sports and premium packages should be around 38,500-39,500.  The dealer is quite flexible on the price in that most of the options can be installed on site at the dealer (for example the kardon stereo).  Therefore, go into the dealer with a will to strive for low to mid $38k.  After all, the demand for the 328i has recently slowed because those who really wanted it have already got it.  In its second year of production, the 328i is not as hot as it was last year.  You have a better position in this negotiation, so go in knowing that there are always other dealers that want your business if first negotiations fail.   <br><br>
