            I am in love with my RAV4. I have owned two Corollas since 1980, and bought the RAV4 in '98. It combines the best of both worlds: the ability to transport large objects and a roomy interior with the ease of parking and maneuvering of a compact car. Who needs these huge SUV's for city driving? The RAV4 is just right, and I don't understand why everyone doesn't have one!

We are a Toyota family because nothing serious ever goes wrong with them -- they just need general maintenance and upkeep. I also love sitting higher up, and the wide range of vision it affords. The ride is very smooth. It is also very cute and sporty looking. A number of times, people have stopped me on the street and asked about the car, especially when it was new. 

The only thing I was disappointed about was that the shocks needed replacing recently. 

This car is for everyone -- my niece had one in college, and I would think senior citizens would like it as well. <br><br>
