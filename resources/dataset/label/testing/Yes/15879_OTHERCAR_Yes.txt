            A 1995 Cirrus was the first of 2 Chrysler "Cloud" cars that I owned.  I picked the car up used with about 12000 miles on it - supposedly it had come in off a lease deal.  I liked the styling, interior, and performance it offered.  I was using the car for business travel and was putting 20000 - 30000 miles a year on it.

In my travels I found that it handled well, got good gas mileage, and was generally comfortable on long trips.  The major problem with the car was its brakes.  As I rolled up the miles, I found I was going through front brake pads about every 12000 miles.  In addition, while driving on mountain roads, the brakes would fade so badly that the brake pedal would go all the way to the floor.  At this point the car basically had no brakes until they cooled off.  After the third set of pads, the rotors finally warped to the point were they weren't serviceable.  At that point, I decided to solve the problem if possible.  I equipped the car with Bendix aftermarket rotors and high performance pads, and, replaced the brake fluid in the system with a higher boiling point fluid.  This cure, while expensive, fixed the fading problem.  In addition it tripled the front pad life.  

Another annoyance with this model is changing the spark plugs.  Much of the induction system has to be removed from the engine to gain access to the rear plugs - a bit of a challenge for a home mechanic.  In addition to buying the plugs, you have to have a $20 dollar gasket set to put the blasted engine back together.

I put 100,000 miles on this car, and, it did fine once I got the brake problem solved.  I never had any problems with the drivetrain in it.  In fact I replaced it with a 1998 Cirrus.
