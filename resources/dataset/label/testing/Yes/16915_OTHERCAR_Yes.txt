            I live in the SF Bay Area, and wanted to get an all-around vehicle. I'm into camping, skiing, river sports, boating and road trips. I also have a big dog. As a professional photographer, I need something that can hold a lot of gear. 

I had my eye on the Subaru Outback for a few years, and finally bought one in December 1998. Absolutely NO REGRETS whatsoever. I looked at the Forester, and though it has more cargo space and, it doesn't ride as smoothly. I thought about the larger SUVs, but the gas mileage and sticker prices turned me off. 

I previously drove a 1986 Chevy Blazer K-5 and a 1996 Honda Accord LX. Loved 'em both, but now I have the best of both worlds. I won't go into the individual features (if you're looking into this vehicle, you can go to the dealership for a brochure or check out their site) but I can tell you that the vehicle has surpassed my expectations in every way. It handles incredibly in rain and snow, though it isn't marketed as an all-terrain vehicle. It downshifts automatically in declining grades, and handles beautifully and smoothly on highways and city streets. 

Mileage is excellent. (I can't stand urbanites who have those obscenely huge SUVs--brush guards and all, when the biggest obstacle they are likely to face are speed bumps at the local Safeway!) It's more environmentally sound than the larger SUVs, and holds enough gear to get a party of four to the mountains in comfortable style. Of course, I've got my Green Turtle fitted with Yakima racks, and utilize them frequently. 

I never thought I'd drive a station wagon, EVER, but there is definitely a certain kind of &quot;cool&quot; associated with having my Outback. 

What I do recommend: Use tire chains in the snow, unless you have snow tires (note: not &quot;all weather tires&quot;). This goes for all 4-wheel vehicles, and is a lesson I learned early on! 

This vehicle is extremely comfortable. I'm tall (5'10&quot;) for a chick and have lower back problems. Long road trips in my otherwise lovely Honda could be painful; I've never had a problem with my highly-adjustible Outback seats and its roomy interior. 

Here's how the Outback really kicks SUV tailpipe: Loading an Outback, with its lower profile, is a LOT easier. I can put more inside, more on top, etcetera without having to get a ladder or break my back. 

So okay, it looks like a turtle. But it performs like a hare.
