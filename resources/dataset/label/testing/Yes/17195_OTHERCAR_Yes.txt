            In March 2000, we added the 1997 Maxima GLE to our family. After driving a car with few luxuries for years, this was heaven. I bought it used, with 52,000 miles and have put 7,000 miles on it since then, and it has been a pleasure!! It is a beauty: rosewood color, moonroof, and leather inside. Power everything. I also had the opportunity to see exactly what this &quot;Beauty&quot; would do, and I chickened out at 120 miles per hour. It was smooth and quiet, and the Bose system truly added to the experience. There is absolutely NOTHING that I hate about this car. NOTHING.  

My car gets great gas mileage despite the fact that I am a leadfoot and typically hard on vehicles. The V6 engine gives me alot of power, but is quiet and smooth. The handling on this car is exceptional, and the design is such that you are able to judge distance well and not struggle with a &quot;blind spot&quot;.

We can easily load up 2 adult, 2 children, a cooler, 4 lawnchairs and baseball equipment for the kids games, and still have trunk space, it is very spacious. The car itself is very roomy, yet not obnoxious in size.

This car is suitable for anyone. In my experience it has proven to be reliable, and I certainly trust the Nissan name.  Anyone who can afford one, should definitely buy one!!<br><br>
