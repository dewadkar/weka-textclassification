            I haven't had my camera as long as some of the other people who wrote opinions for this camera.  I have had mine for a little over a year.  It's taken over 1,000 pictures for the internet, and that should tell you right there how much my family and I enjoy it!

From the first day I had it, I was very amused.  I'm not a techie, and I was very excited when I figured out how to turn it ON, then slowly I learned to take pictures with it.  This camera not only has a built in zoom, but has a 1 and one half by 2 inch viewable screen.  It also has built in flash and several different picture taking modes you can set it for action shots, outdoors shots, this camera has everything you can think of.

This camera uses a floppy, which makes it extremely easy to move pictures from your camera to your computer.  You take your pictures, then just take your disk out and pop it into your computer.  It can't be any easier!  The only con I can think of is the battery.  It starts  out with about 130 minutes worth of juice, and it comes with a recharger.  Well, of course as you recharge it your total minutes slowly start to reduce.  I think our battery maxes out at about 60 minutes or so.  So, eventually we are going to have to find a new Info Lithium battery.  

In conclusion, this is a great camera to buy, whether you are a techie or have no idea what to do with it.  It'll definetly grow on you.  I've had no problems with mine and it's well over 1,000 pictures!<br><br>
