            I am a proud owner of a 2000 S-10 Extended cab 4 x 4.I have driven every type of domestic small truck and have found that the GM line-up offers the best options and equipment.I found that this truck drives very smoothly and with less interior noise than its competition.The S-10 has good ground clearance and is easily accessible.The controls in the cab are easy to use and conveniently located.The 3rd door option in the extended cab is wonderful to have and makes it very easy to put cargo in the rear area of the cab.The engine has very adequate power and provides decent fuel economy.It excels in the mid range power area.The lease programs currently in place on the S-10's are excellent as are the value on a buy.You get alot of truck for the amount of money.The 4 cyl engine is a little under powered with the automatic trans but becomes alot better with the manual trans.I like the appearance of the vehicle and it is conservative in design but still has a sleek look.I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
