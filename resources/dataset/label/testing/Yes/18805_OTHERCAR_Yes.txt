            I bought a used '98 Jeep Cherokee Limited Edition about three weeks ago.  I formerly
owned a '95 SE model Cherokee but found that it was time to trade it in.  Overall though
the '95 was a solid car and had good pick-up , average handling and a solid drive it was
not all it was cracked up to be.  The '95 had 2 wheel-drive which though it did the job
never made me happy.  It also had base line everything including manual windows and
locks, and the base stereo with only two speakers.  A recommendation:  never buy the
baseline of anything.  Instead go to a smaller vehicle or change manufacturers all
together.  Compared to the below average handling and lackluster performance of the
2wd '95 the new 4x4 '98 is excellent.  The ride is ten times smoother although still not up
to the Grand Cherokeeï¿½s standards.  The interior is a lot better to look at especially the
gauges, easy to read and there are even audible signals for low gas, the seat belt, and any
other dash board illuminates.  The stereo (CD player and tape deck together) is an
ingenious idea but the speakers and the equalizer leave a little to be desired.  The SUV
handles well and has improved its brakes since '95.  The rear seat leave little leg room for
the taller person but is great for kids.  Overall, good placements of instruments and a
strong ride with better than average pick-up.  This SUV is rugged on and off the road. If
you have ever owned a vehicle in which you sit high you know it is difficult to go back to
a car.  The Cherokee gives you a good view of the road and a sense of security with its
dual airbags.  This vehicle is for everyone from the grocery getter mom to the college
student to the off road enthusiast. Excellent choice.<br><br>
