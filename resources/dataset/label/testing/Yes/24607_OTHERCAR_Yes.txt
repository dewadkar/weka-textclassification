            I bought my 94 Tercel in 1998 and haven't had any mechanical problems with it.  Sure, I had a flat tire once, but that's hardly the car's fault.  I put in a new a radio and windshield wipers, given it an oil change every 3000 miles.  A tune-up every year.  That's about it.  Very low maintenance car.  The car now has over 104,000 miles and still runs great.  The engine is very quiet.  I have never once been unable to start it, or had the car stall on me.  It's a very fuel-efficient economy car.  Easy and fun to drive.  No luxuries, however.  Not even power locks and windows.  The car could stand to be roomier, too.  This is certainly not a car you want if have good money to put into a car.  But this car is very practical and has low insurance.  Overall, I like it very much and would recommend it to another.
