            For years, the design of the Acura Integra hatchbacks has not changed.  Acura kept the design the same as previous models because the design literally sold itself. Although Acura Integras have great designs, not every teenagers will be satisfied with the their first test drive.  It is highly recommended that the driver test drive the car to find how comfortably he could drive safely.  For some drivers, the Integra hatchbacks might be too small to drive safely.

There are four types of Integra hatchbacks.  The basic model is the �LS.�  The LS has clothed seating.  The �GS� model is equipped with leather seating.  Both Integras come equipped with 4 cylinder 140 horsepower engines with 124 ft. lbs. of torque.  The �GS-R� model has a 170 horsepower engine with 128 ft. lbs. of torque.  Finally the �Type-R� has a a 195 horsepower engine.  Both the GS-R and Type-R has VTEC that enhances the overall performance.

Performance

The engines are 1.8L, slightly larger than the 1.7 L Honda Civic EX engines that has 127 horsepower.  While the engine is small, the power is not great for LS and GS models.  On the other hand, engines in GS-Rs and Type Rs will exhilarate the driver.  There is a big jump with a difference of only 30 horsepower!  140 horsepower sounds a lot but the driver would have to floor the pedal every time, he is at the on-ramp of a freeway.  GS-R�s and Type R�s performance will convince the driver to only floor the pedal when the freeways are clear.  The engine is quite and the Integras are fun cars to drive like Hondas.  Fuel economy is at 25 MPG at the city and 31 MPG at the highways.

Exterior

The Integra is a car with sleek looks.  Teenagers will have numerous accessories and custom parts to choose, to �fix up� their Integras.  Teenagers will have a fun time driving Integras because they are fast, light, and responsive.  The rear spoiler adds a sporty look, although it is a standard only on GS and GS-R models.  The rear windshield wiper is a plus, especially during winter.  With the rear wiper, the driver will feel safe that he could pass and back the car up without saying �I can�t see!�

Interior

The Integra hatchback is equipped with AM/FM CD that is loud.  Unfortunately, it has too much treble.  The bass distorts, at high volume.  My suggestion would be to go to an electronic store and upgrade the sound system to an Alpine system.  Polk Audio and Boston are also great speakers that drivers could choose to upgrade. The front seat is comfortable to sit but some tall drivers will feel cramped driving, even with the seat lowered and back all the way.  Even worse, the back seat could be intolerable for tall people.  If golf clubs and hockey sticks are going to be loaded, the two back seats fold down to make more trunk room.

Recommended for

Young teenagers.  As long as the driver feels comfortable, the Integra hatchback is recommended because of its excellent resell value, sleek looks, and custom accessories that are available.  The LS and GS come equipped as either automatic or manual.

Not recommended for

Tall teenagers and adults.  The Integra hatchback is not for all teens.  Also, teens and adults who only know how to drive automatic transmissions should look for either the LS or GS because the GS-R and the Type R is only available as manual transmission.

If you are car shopping, test drive Honda Accord Coupe, Ford Mustang, Mitsubishi Eclipse, and Toyota Celica GT.  The cars mentioned have a price tag form $17,000 to $26,000.  Tall drivers should be comfortable test driving Honda Accord Coupe and Ford Mustang.  For the serious driver, the Type R is usually sold for $30,000 because it is considered as a �limited edition.�  There are serial numbers that is displayed only for Type Rs.  The 2001 Acura Integra is completely redesigned.  I would suggest that the driver test drive the new 2001 Integras and find if it suits his need.  The price tag of Acua Integras, is steep at $18,000-$30,000.  Test drive the V8 Ford Mustang because for $25,000, the Mustang GT is equipped with premium sound system and accessories.<br><br>
