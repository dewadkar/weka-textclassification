            I purchased a 99 1500 Silverado LT shortbed extended cab three door with the 5.3L engine to replace a 96 Grand Cherokee that had been nothing but headaches.  What a difference! It has all the options - including leather seats, electric windows, locks and seats with heat - (really nice, even here in Arizona, on chilly mornings) and of course also included the tow package. I needed something that would pull a 21' travel trailer without getting tired like the Jeep. With the trailer at legal highway speeds you don't know it's there up hill or down. Over secondary roads it drives like an automobile with trailer or without.  The comfort is superb with the all ways adjustable seats. The climate control is excellent with separate ducting through the console for the rear seats. The A/C is plenty cool even on our 110 degree days.  The rear seat is the most comfortable (and roomy) that we found on any of the competition during our search of the new car lots. Ford and Dodge don't compare! The new body style is very aerodynamic and I get 19 - 20 on the highway and not much less around town. The only problem so far (16,000 miles) was the power driver's side window that went down and wouldn't go back up - stripped gears due to a factory defect that was quickly repaired at the dealership. This occurred with about 1000 miles on the odometer. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone needing the sophistication and capacity of a high end pickup and who wants to have fun driving a vehicle that will draw favorable comments from all that see it.   <br><br>
