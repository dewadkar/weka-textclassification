            As will be well evidenced in my comments, this is not a technical review; just a few statements from experience and from the heart.

I purchased my C5050 last February (2003) as the first step in converting to digital photography.  In the far past I was somewhat involved with amateur photography (Nikon F & Nikonos); however, I had drifted away from it over a large number of years.  Never all that good, just for pleasure with very occasional complements from friends.

I have found the C5050 to be the answer to all my wishes.  With the possible exception of the shutter delay (I am experimenting with smaller size now) it is truly an outstanding camera capable of producing results (especially close up work) which have resulted in me receiving more complements than I have ever experienced before.

I have added the FL40 flash unit, mounting bar, and extension lenses to my set up and have found all to be great complements to the base camera and all of outstanding Olympus quality.  My next addition will be the underwater case so I can use the camera underwater, in my kayak, on my bicycle, skiing, and any other activity wherein weatherproofness could be an issue.

My basic reason for the selection of the C5050 was a combination of price (I purchased a rehab unit from Olympus) and the combination of features offered.  My research indicated that it did not have an equal in terms of price and my past experience with Olympus quality was very, very positive.
