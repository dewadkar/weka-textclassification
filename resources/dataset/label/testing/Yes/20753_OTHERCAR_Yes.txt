            I bought my Blazer new in 1998 for several reasons. I had a young child and it was rated very safe and more importantly, it had plenty of room for the car seat and all those toys that end up living in your car. I also picked the Blazer, because I am forever on the go, whether it be day to day driving or traveling on the road, I do a lot of it and needed a car that could handle anything I could. I have put about 20,000 miles on it every year and have had no trouble whatsoever with the engine, etc. I loaded it up with accessories including running boards, ski racks, window guards, cargo organizer, keyless entry w/alarm, etc. and I love it. The only problem I have encountered with this vehicle is this: the seat handle that raises and lower the back of the seat (upright or recline) simply falls off about twice a year on the driver's seat and once on the passenger's seat. The dealership is aware of this problem and keeps replacing the handle (even after the warranty expired), but cannot fix it so it won't fall off again. I know I am not the only one experiencing this problem and you'd think they'd fix it properly, but if that's the only thing I have to deal with in a vehicle, I can handle that!
