            We bought out Sony Mavica digital camera last year at the church.  We needed something easy to use and we wanted to use the pictures on our church website and for print material.  This Mavica has been fantastic.  
We tried a cheaper digital camera, the kind that you have to hook up to your computer to load the pictures and I found that to be a terrible limitation.  The ability to take several simple computer disks with you and keep the pics on the disks until ready to use is just priceless to me.

The images are great and look wonderful on the internet.  The camera will not let you take a blurry pictures either, so each image is a solid one.
The re-chargable battery is a blessing!  We got a lot of use out of the camera.  

Unfortunately the camera took some abuse by our youth and stopped working this summer.  I believe it was dropped once or more.  Now it does not load up disks.  I don't think that this reflects poorly on the camera, only on the operators! LOL! We have submitted it for repair, I hope to see many more pictures from this great digital camera soon!<br><br>
