            After about one year of looking around, my wife and I each bought a "new" car in December. I bought a 2001 Toyota Camry with 11,000 miles on it and Susan bought a 2001 Dodge
Intrepid with 25,000 miles.  I have already reviewed a 2002 Camry but after three months of driving, I plan to review my 2001 in the near future.

Susan's bought a beautiful silver Intrepid that is a joy to drive.  She drives it most of the time but I have also driven it so I feel qualified to write a knowledgeable review.

THE ENGINE

The Intrepid comes with a 2.7 liter, 24-valve V6 engine which is not only powerful but also fuel efficient.  It delivers 200 horsepower at 5,800 rpm.  In other words, the car can move swiftly if you need to pass on a two-lane road.  Even with this power, Susan has been averaging 25 miles per gallon on the highway and around 20 in town.  The car has a 4-speed automatic.

Although not a part of the engine system, the car's design also helps with comfort, power, and fuel efficiency.  I'm sure you've seen the aerodynamic design of the car.  It features a 113-inch wheelbase and a four-wheel independent suspension which allows a very smooth drive. The car is easy to control due to a MacPherson strut front suspension and a Chapman struts rear suspension which increases stability during cornering.

THE INTERIOR

I'll start with the dashboard.  First of all, everything is conveniently placed for the driver.  My one complaint is that the cruise control is a bit more complex than it needs to be.  But then I'm spoiled by my Camry's incredibly efficient system which allows you to control the speed
with one hand without even looking at the steering wheel.  Other than that, the Intrepid's "cockpit styling" is both attractive and driver friendly.  The guages are white during the day and easily read and at night, the same gauges are backlit for clarity.  All of the controls are
well-lit and within easy reach.

This Intrepid is extremely comfortable with a power bucket seat which envelopes each driver. All in all, it is one of the most comfortable cars I've ever been in.  The seats are, of course, adjustable as is the steering wheel.  Legroom is not a problem in the front or back.  I'm 6'3"
and I am comfortable in any seat in the vehicle.

The air-conditioning and heater are not only excellent but designed to provide more air for the backseat passengers due to four well-placed outlets integrated into the center console.  

The cup holders in the car amazingly hold my 44 ounce Big Gulps which is rare.

The car has an 18.4 cubic foot trunk which is very well designed and is capable of holding objects up to 7 feet long when you fold the rearseat down.

The car is amazingly quiet.  I filled up with gas yesterday on a very cold day.  Of course, I had turned the car off as I added fuel, but as I paid, Susan started the car.  When I got back in, I had to ask her if it was running because it is so quiet.  DaimlerChrysler has tested the vehicle with some of the most sophisticated sound equipment available and it is virtually soundproof from annoying road noises.

SAFETY EQUIPMENT

In addition to the usual seat belts and air bags, the Intrepid instrument panel is also equipped with front-seat knee blockers which help absorb impact energies and stop the
occupants from sliding under the panel.

The car also has a "safety cage" which is designed to crush and absorb a collision impact instead of transferring it to the driver or passengers.  This cage has crumple zones which
reinforce the passenger compartment.

The vehicle also has high-strength steel side-guard door beams and the car already meets 2003 standards for head-impact protection.  With all this protection, however, the car does not drive like a tank.  It has a short turning ratio for a car of its size and also is very smooth on the road.

SECURITY

The Intrepid features a keyless entry system which allows you to open all doors, the trunk and a "panic" button which tells others you need help or just lets you find your car in a crowded parking lot.  When pushed, the horn honks and exterior lights flash for up to three minutes.  My only gripe with the key fob is that locking the car causes the horn to sound. This is not too bad in a parking lot but it is a nuisance late at night when it tends to bother
neighbors.  Of course, you can always use the manual locking system if you remember to do so.

Another feature of the Intrepid is the power-assisted four-wheel antilock brake system.  The system allows greater control and stopping ability on almost any road surface.

OTHER FEATURES

Visibility in the car is excellent with the mirrors and the generous windows which feature solar control on every window.

The exterior lights are quad halogen headlamps with an automatic-off feature.

Actually in the safety area, Intrepid features Top Tether Anchors mounted on the read window panel and lower LATCH anchors for use with compatible aftermarket child safety
seats.

The sound system is excellent although we had to add a CD system to Susan's model.  The car has 4 speakers and has plenty of volume if that's what you want.

We chose the Essex cloth interior although Royale leather is also available.  Leather in West Texas makes about as much sense as Osama Bin Laden in a bikini.  It's just too hot for leather unless you have masochistic tendencies..

As I mentioned, Susan chose the Bright Silver Metallic but the choices range from Stone White to Black with a variety of reds, blues and greens.  The look of the car is beautiful and I believe it is a much better value than the Concorde which looks virtually the same and costs much more.

Finally, Susan wrangled a very good deal from the salesman at our local Chrysler dealer.  She bought the car for less than $14,000 which had the salesman near tears (but, of course, he recovered quickly.)  A new 2001 was available on the same lot but it was about $8000 more. Susan and I are very happy with this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful, fairly fuel efficient car that drives like a dream and looks great.
