            I have been a serious photographer for more than 20 years.  After getting an expensive education in business administration I spent the first few years of my post academic career as a freelance professional photographer in Los Angeles.  Although I gave up photography as a profession some 17 years ago I still love it and spend what little discretionary time that my family and career allow pursuing it on my own terms.

I come from the &quot;old school&quot; whereby the transition to automatic exposure and programmed settings was something that seemed to be an unthinkable infringement on my creative control.  My initiation to the digital world, however, has greatly altered my prejudices.  The Olympus c-2020 Zoom is my first digital camera after having shot for more than 20 years with 35mm and medium format film cameras.  Since purchasing the Olympus approximately 2 months ago I haven't touched my beloved film camera.

After extensively researching the market and speaking with numerous digital photogs I narrowed my list of choices to the Olympus C-2020 Z, the Olympus C-3030 Z, the Nikon CoolPix 950 and 990.  If the truth be known I really wanted the Nikon.  As a former pro I was biased by the Nikon reputation in the pro market as well as the outstanding performance of both the 950 and 990.  The C-2020, however, seemed to have all of the features that were offered by the Nikon with the possible exception of a more limited macro capability (focusing to 8&quot; as opposed to less than 1&quot; with the Nikons).  In addition, the Nikons are plagued with a &quot;red-eye&quot; problem which results from having the flash too close to the lens.  In the final analysis the Olympus seemed to offer more cluck for the buck and I was able to purchase it new for approximately $575 which was about $100 less than the best price I could find at the time for the Nikon CoolPix 950.  That being said, I am delighted with my choice.

The C-2020 was simple to use out of the box.  It offers an excellent &quot;programmed&quot; mode which makes the shutter speed and aperture choices for you but gives you the option of making manual adjustments if you desire.  As it turns out I use the programmed mode all the time and find that the results are excellent.  The image quality is very good - much better than I expected from a digital camera.  I routinely print 5x7 and 8x10 prints on my HP Deskjet 720 and find that they could easily pass for film lab prints.  The flash also works well and provides excellent fill for outdoor portraits.  There is still some &quot;red-eye&quot; but no more than with any other point and shoot style camera.  The camera can accept an external strobe unit and can also be used with studio strobes - this is a tremendous plus for the serious photog.

The camera fits well in my hand and is very compact.  I take it with my almost everywhere.  The performance has been better than my wildest dreams.  Although the camera is only 2.1 megapixels I find that this is more than enough for most assignments - including portraits.  My wife is a feature writer for a newspaper and I regularly shoot the photos for her stories.  The last 3 have been done with the Oly and have turned out very well.

The C-2020's lens can be adapted to use close-up and tele-extender attachments.  I have not used these yet but have used with the camera to do near &quot;infrared&quot; work.

Thus far the camera has been an excellent performer.  I have no complaints other than the fact that I would still like the ability to do macro work at less than 8 inches.  The 8mb smartcard that comes with the card is also less than adequate in terms of storage.  I have purchased an additional 64 mb card and can get 58-60 images on the card in the SHQ JPEG mode.  The cost of the smartmedia cards is a drawback.  A work-around which I intend to try is getting a writeable CD drive for my laptop so that I can download my images and reuse the card while on location.

The Olympus C-2020 Z is a great camera.  Whether you are a weekend snapshooter, a serious amateur or even a pro, this camera will serve you well.  <br><br>
