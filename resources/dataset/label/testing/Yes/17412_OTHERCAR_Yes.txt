            This is a review of a 1998 4Runner 4WD recently purchased used.  I have owned several Nissan and Toyota 4WDs, both in truck and SUV form, since 1991.  I actually take my vehicles off-road and in the snow, but no rock-crawling or anything that requires major modifications to the suspension or wheel/tire size.  

One of the best improvements Toyota has made in the past eight years has been their 3.4 liter V6 engine which replaced the old 3.0 liter V6.  The new engine is very refined, has plenty of power and gets decent mileage for a vehicle of this class.  

The 4Runner's suspension is indeed stiff compared to my previous vehicle (1997 Nissan Pathfinder SE); it is on par with my 2000 Toyota Tacoma 4WD and 1993 Nissan 4WD pickup.  This stiffness is designed in for both off-road applications - makes certain your wheel rebounds to contact with the ground - and for load-carrying.  For those who complain about the stiff suspension, they must keep in mind what the vehicle is designed for.  Due to the stiff suspension, body roll is held to a minimum for a vehicle of this class.  My only gripe is with the 4Runner's tendency to have a saggy butt, i.e. the rear end is lower than the front.  I like to look DOWN on the road, not up thank you.  Anyway, this was easily remedied with a coil spring spacer purchased from Cornfed Suspension (I highly recommend them). 


With this trim level, it comes with cloth interior.  The pattern is well....interesting.  The texture is a bit rough but it ages well - no pilling as with the softer velour-type seating in the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The AM/FM CD player is adequate but could be better; there is a bit of distortion at higher volumes due to mismatching of head unit & speaker power-handling ability.  This is a very minor gripe as in most situations the volume is nowhere near maximum.  

The seats are very firm, again on par with my '00 Tacoma.  My Nissan's I've owned tended to have softer seats.  The firm seats are designed to keep your tush in place while you're off-roading.  I have rented a Jeep Grand Cherokee for a week-long vacation in Northern Arizona which included some off-roading and the unsupportive soft seats did not hold me (or my wife) in place very well at all (though the suspension - 2 live axles) was amazing.  

There are other vehicles out there which have more comfortable rides, are easier to climb in and out of, and get better gas mileage.  Most of those vehicles are not designed to handle the beating of off-road driving.  Some do not even have low-range 4WD.  Some have reliability issues which need to be resolved.  It is difficult to overlook Toyota's long history of providing off-road capable, extremely reliable vehicles and that is what ultimately influenced my decision to purchase the 4Runner.  So far I have not been disappointed.
