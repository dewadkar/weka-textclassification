            The Dodge 4x4 is a much better buy than either the Ford or the Chevy.  While they are all comparable, the Dodge has many advantages.  It is designed to be modified, a lift kit is about $400 cheaper for Dodge than Ford or Chevy.  It also has the highest underbelly of the 3.  The standard sound system isn't that great, but that is not hard to change.  

The engine was nearly silent, so I added a Flowmaster and increased to 3&quot; piping on mine, and now it sounds like a truck, and I have much better top end acceleration.  It governs out at 100mph, at 3,000 rpms, it redlines at 5000 on up to 6000.  I'm sure if you chip it, you could get another 15 mph out of it.  I only have the 5.2L engine, but with the trailer tow package, you get 2 coolant systems, so its guarenteed not to overheat easily.

This truck is very easy to work on, and in my opinion looks the best.  It also comes with a decent 3 year warrenty including electric problems.  Headers for the V8 Ram run about $800 I believe.  Of course, with the flow master, I tend to get about 14 miles to the gallon.  But it has a 26 gallon tank, so you can get a good 300 miles to a tank.  

It also holds its value much better than Ford. Ford loses value fastest of the 3, whereas chevy I think holds value a little better.<br><br>
