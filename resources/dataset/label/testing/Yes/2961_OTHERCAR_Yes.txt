            My parents bought this vehicle 2 years ago when it first came out.  It is the king of all SUVs.  We drove the Ford, Chevy, Lexus, and BMW models that were close to the Lincoln Navigator.  It by far is a brute off-road, and a stylish, great looking gem to take anywhere.  It is comfortable and very roomy.  The third seat in the rear of the Navigator also offers a comfortable ride on long trips.  It has a ton of cargo room and has an engine that would compare to any in its class.  It provides great acceleration which is usually unheard of for a car it's size.  Lincoln spared nothing in creating this luxury vehicle.  It has so many extras, you will still be discovering the extras long after you have bought this car.  Everything Power, everything leather, and all luxury.  That is why I love the Lincoln Navigator, and recommend it to you.<br><br>
