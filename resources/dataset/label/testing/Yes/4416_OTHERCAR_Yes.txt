                 In the few years I've owned my 95  Grand Prix GTP I've fallen in love with it.  No only is it a smooth comfortable ride, the steering and suspension on it has gotten me out of a couple close calls.  Driving it can be whatever you want it to be, It's sporty enough to be a flashy sports car, yet not as cop attractive as most other sports cars.  But it can also be a luxury car with a clean cut look and it's great appearence.  If saftey is a concern, don't let it be.  From personal experience, I have learned I can trust my Grand Prix in those really bad accidents.  
     There are a few aspects of the car that I didn't like however.  On mine and others I have seen, the front bumper has been know to &quot;sag&quot;.  By this I mean where bumper comes together with the body panel just next to the wheel-well.  Also the disc brakes caused a lot of brake dust to form on the alloys. The last part obout the car that I didn't like, was that it was so crammed under the hood that even normal repairs could take hours.
     Finnally, if it is an option at all, I suggest getting the Head Up Display on the vehicle, wich projects a digit image containing how fast you are going on the windshield making it so you never have to take your eyes off the road to check your speed.<br><br>
