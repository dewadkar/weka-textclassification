            I have never been much of an SUV person, but in December of 1999 I bought a new 1999 2 wheel drive Tahoe. Was I impressed, you bet. This was the best purchase I have ever made. It rides great and it rides better then any car or truck I have ever owned or driven, has plenty of space (which I need since I am tall and have kids), it gets great gas mileage ( I can drive over 400 miles without stopping for gas)and this is the kind of gas mileage most other SUV's don't get,it also has plenty of space for big items if you need it just buy laying down the seats. Also you can have a TV VCR system put in it for traveling and is great if you have kids. They can watch what they want and be happy the whole trip. It is easy to get in and out of and is easy to park in parking spaces. Which most bigger vehicles aren't. It also have plenty of storage compartments. And as for price, well its really good. I price compared before I bought it and no other SUV could match that price for the quality!!! So would I recommend this to others you bet and will I buy another one, O yes no doubt about it!!  <br><br>
