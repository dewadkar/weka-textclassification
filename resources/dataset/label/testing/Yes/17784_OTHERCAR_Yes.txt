            I purchased my new 2 door red 1994 Dodge Shadow soon after graduating from college.  The first thing I did was drive cross-country from Boston to Portland and back. Six years later I still own this car.  It has been extremely reliable with very low maintenance costs.  

Lately I find myself looking longingly at new model cars when driving on the highway.  I would love to buy a new car, but I can't justify the expense.  My Dodge just keeps on performing year after year. 

I live in the northeast and this car has performed very well in rain, snow, and icy conditions.  

I have noticed a few small areas where paint has come off on the body, but I have not experienced the severe flaking others have complained about.  I think my paint problems have been caused by small rocks chipping the coat over time. 

My original factory speakers have started to crackle, so it is time to replace the sound system.  

Other than those two small problems in over 6 years this car has been a winner!  <br><br>
