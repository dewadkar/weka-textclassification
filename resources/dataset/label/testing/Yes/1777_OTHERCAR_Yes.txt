               Being in the military does not afford me too many luxuries in life when it comes to big bill items.  But one thing I have always loved is to look and feel good in whatever automobile is sitting in my driveway.  And it is for this reason that I have owned my 1997 Chrysler Sebring JXi Convertible for nearly two years, almost 2 times my vehicle's normal shelf life.
   I first experienced the Sebring on a whim.  I had stopped at a dealership looking and fully intending to purchase a sharp Jeep Cherokee that they had in their lot.  I was trading in a Jeep Wrangler and although I had loved to have the top down at the beach, the Wrangler did not offer me the power and economy that I needed.  While waiting for the dealer to bring out the Cherokee I got into a Sebring and took it for a top-down ride through Myrtle Beach.  I immediately feel in love.  Here was my Jeep Wrangler's style and enjoyment in an affordable, more reasonably economic and most importantly eye-catching ride.  I purchased it that same week.
   Let's start with the cons to the Sebring.  First you must realize that it IS a soft cover convertible.  Therefore you will have a bit of wind noise at speed and you will have the occasional water leak drip.  But these things aside there is more you should know.  The Sebring looks great, but the engine lacks a little to back up the sporty exterior.  I have the 6 cyl. engine and find myself at times wishing for more, but if you are a patient driver this car can still be for you.  The assembly of my car is actually quite solid although I have heard other owners complain in this area.
   Now to the pros.  For a mid-20's male this car has what it takes.  It is very reasonably priced for a car in it's class and the gas mileage is a reassuring average compared to other sporty cars.  But for the real thrill, put the top down, turn up the premium Infinity stereo system, relax back into the comfortable leather seats and roll down by the beach.  See if you can't pick up a gal if you are not married. ;)  You will be surprised what your friends have to say when they see you pull up.  Everyone wants a ride, everyone wants to feel that convertible power of wind in your face and ruffling your hair.
   Yes the Chrysler Sebring Convertible is a poor man's dream.  And for my experiences at least, it has been a very pleasant one.
