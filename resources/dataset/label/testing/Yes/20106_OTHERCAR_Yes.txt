            The M5 is truly what I believe is the fastest sedan on the planet.  Bmw has flat gone all out when they developed the M5.  Before I bought this car, I drove many different high performance sedans and to tell you the truth not one came close to acceleration, handling, and top end speed of the M5.  I drove the Lexus GS 400 which was nice and luxuruios but simply did not have the fire that the M5 possessed.  I then moved on and drove the highly acclaimed Mercedes Benz E55 amg.  This car had good handling and was fairly fast, yet I then thought back to what kind of car I am purchasing, A Chrysler.  I have never been a big fan of Chrysler and they have in my point of view almost ruined the company by adding cheap elements to the cars.  But all in all the M5 is a complete package.  The body style is sleak and sporty and at the same time it is a comfortable ride providing both smoothness and plenty of room for all passengers (even in the back!).  The M5 also comes in some amazing colors such as the new Titanium color from BMW.  So, I believe that if you are looking for a car that combines both speed and luxury the M5 will fit you like a glove.<br><br>
