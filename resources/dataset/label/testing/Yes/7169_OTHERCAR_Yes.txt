            I bought this truck used in 1995. It had 19,000 miles on it. What attracted me to it was the fact that at the time dodge truck had the highest resale value in the industry. When I test drove it I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was. It has plenty of power with the 5.2 liter engine.

This truck has been very reliable. It now has 75,000 miles on it. The only work besides routine oil changes, filters etc... is a brake job at 55,000 miles and I just put a new muffler and tail pipe on it. The heater and AC are very good. This truck was built like to last.

The interior of this truck is not as nice a the newer dodge's or the Ford of the same year but I'll give that up in a second for the ride and reliability of this vehicle. The gas mileage is not all that good (16mpg city) but if I was looking for that I wouldn't have bought a truck. 

This truck is now 7 years old and still drives like it did at 2 years. I usually trade my vehicles in after about 3 or 4 years but I have no doubt that I'll be driving this truck for another 3 or 4 years. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a truck that has lots of power and good reliability.
