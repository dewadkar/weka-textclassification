            I just bought this vehicle from a dealer specializing in pre-owned SUV's and I like it very much.  It's comfortable, rides quite smoothly for an SUV, and is nice to look at.  But I'm not proud of two of the main reasons I find driving it so pleasant:  I can reach the radio controls without leaning over, and my cup holder keeps my hot coffee in perfect reach.  

I have a 5 year old daughter and a 12 week old son, so car seats fitting in the back seat are an important factor.  While my daughter's booster seat fits fine, when combined with the infant seat in the middle things get pretty tight back there.  The infant seat does not seem to fit as well as I would like, and I am going to bring the vehicle to AAA to fit the seat as tightly as it did in my old car, a Volvo wagon.

The 4x4 function was tested early on in light of the incredible snow and ice we have had in the east, and I must say, it was nice plowing over my unshoveled driveway with such ease.  I wouldn't go any faster in an SUV than I would in a sedan in those conditions, but I could definitely see the benefits of having this type of vehicle.

All in all, I am extremely pleased with my &quot;new&quot; used Ford Explorer.<br><br>
