            Let me begin by saying that I purchased my 1998 Chevrolet Metro LSI Coupe (Hatchback) after a long and painful love affair with a 1989 Dodge Colt Station Wagon. For those of you unfamiliar with the Dodge Colt, let me just say that when a listener calls in to &quot;Car Talk&quot; and starts describing their latest adventures with a Dodge Colt, Click and Clack inevitably tell the caller that his/her first problem is they bought a Dodge Colt.

But I digress... I was still pretty fresh-faced from college, but tired of paying the equivalent of a car payment a month on repairs to my old car, when I spotted an ad for a dealer model Metro on sale. It had low mileage, ran like a dream and looked perfect. (Side note: if you need to buy a slightly used car, dealer models are the way to go, I think, 'cause the dealers take great care to keep them well-maintained).

I have been so pleased with my little zippy Metro, I cannot imagine driving another car. Sure, it is not the most threatening vehicle on the road, with its happy horn and spunky style, and let me tell you, most folks do not cotton to being passed by a car as itty and bitty as this one... But the mileage! Oh, the mileage alone makes this car worthwhile. In fact, with recent gas prices hitting the roof, I must say that I chuckle evilly at the pump as neighboring sport utility vehicles guzzle gallon after gallon of gas.

The seats are surprisingly comfortable for such a little car, and the back seat folds down for extra cargo space. You will have to face facts, however... You will not be called upon to cart around the little league team or haul your school's newspaper drive anywhere. And maybe that's a good thing (it has been for me).

I have very few complaints about the car, but the cupholders DO TRULY irk me. For whatever reason, the makers of the Metro decided to put in TWO cupholders. Fine. You and your passenger can enjoy a cruise through country roads, each with a refreshing beverage of his own to ward off thirst, right? Wrong! The cupholders are so laughingly miniscule that I have found only Starbuck's Frappucinos and Veryfine juices will fit in them. No fancy travel mugs. No styrofoam coffee cups. And forget about Snapple bottles. Alas, I am STILL forced to hold my big gulps between my thighs as I drive. 

All in all, I think it is a wonderful car if you have little to haul, few friends that use you as a taxi service (most prefer NOT to be squished in the back, tho' I am told one can fit REASONABLY comfortably), and do not mind the fact that larger SUV's will kick sand in your face and call you a wimp. It gets great mileage, fits into virtually any parking space, maneuvers easily and has required no more than basic maintenance.

I have never looked back and sighed in regret over the loss of my Dodge Colt.
