            I have a 2dr EX coupe. Its a 92. It has a sportier suspension than most other accord models. The 92 EX has three things other models don't: 140hp engine, ABS, airbag. Some other EX frills include sunroof, 4 whl disc brakes, and alloy wheels, along with improved suspension components. have the auto trans, and merging on the highway is not really a problem. The trans usually feels like its in the right gear, but can sometimes feel long winded (stays in gear longer than you want it to) when the going gets slow. I drove other Accords before this one, and they all seemed torquey at the low end, but ran out of breath at the high revs. This engine dosen't neccesarily &quot;come alive&quot; at high rpm the way VTEC's do, but their is a definte improvement at the top end compared w/ 130/125 hp model. Note: passing can be accomplished without fear. This model had a special larger exhaust manifold, which is mainly where the horsepower increase comes from. I test drove a 2000 accord four and it was a differnet story. Merging w/ fast moving traffic was scary, (Read: no low end torque to get you moving) but high end power was noticibly improvedNot so in my 92. This car jumps of the line, due to its good low speed torque and throttle linkage settings. The engine never sounds harsh or labored at high RPMs, contrasting w/ Atima and Camry fours, which make unnerving rasping sounds when passing. Overall this is a very responsive car, in acceleration, steering and brakes. The visability is the best of any car I ever driven, and better (in my opinion) than 95% of the cars out on the road, including new Hondas.This is best handling car I've driven. The body dosen't lean in turns, it changes direction , quickly, responsively and predictably even in hard corners. The ride is smooth, passing over most bumps without jolting. If you enjoy driving, and don't have a fortune to spend on a used car, this is probably your best bet. I considered Maxima, Stanza, Civic, G20, and finally found I liked Accord best. If you want a fun to drive, responsive, cheap (6-9K) car, do yourself a favor and at least try the Honda, preferablely the EX with the 140hp. This car is very fun to drive. I would recommend only the EX for college students. The 1992 EX coupe is different/better than the average LX/DX ones, so get a better one if you can afford it. I like this better than the Prelude b/c it is cheaper for insurance, repair, has a normal sized trunk, and can fit four people in some semblence of comfort. For this price range and size class, I thinks its the best compromise between sportiness and value.<br><br>
