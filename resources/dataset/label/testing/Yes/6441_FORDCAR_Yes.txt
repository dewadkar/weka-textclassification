            The style in this picthure is the European style. We have the old fashioned square front end style. It is a ford f350 (one ton) 4 door crew cab, 4 x 4.

We love this truck, at first we were only going to use it for vacations and hunt trips camping etc. Well that soon changed , as we drove it we grew more and more to like it.

It's very roomy. Sits 6 people very comfortable. In the front there is two high back seats that move on their own track and recline. In the middle is a seat that folds down for a console.In the back seat (solid back but) the right and left sides are high backs with a center fold down arm rest. 

This model is a gas engine (v 8 5.8 ) (equal to a 400) automatic transmission with over drive. Non duel rear wheels (but at this point we wished we did as we carry an 11'3&quot; extended self contained camper ) But to our surprise this truck still handles this very well.

At first this truck rode &quot;like a truck&quot; bounchy rough. But we put a 2000 pound front bumper wench on it. This toned it down a lot (I am not saying this truck will ever ride like a luxury car, because it won't)But the more weight it has the smoother the ride.

We did have side rails put on (which added weight too) and being this truck is so high up. (I will never forget the first time I drove it to the store, and went to park and get out I fell into the auto next to me. wasn't expecting it to be that high).

On this model we have, air conditioning, am fm radio with cd player, power windows, power locks, all full power, running lights on roof, automatic transmission with cruse control, towing package (as we tow a 19 foot baylinner boat) , long 8 foot bed. (all as added options)

We knew when we bought it, it would not get very good gas mileage. But even after added all the extra weight, we did not notice any gas mileage change. (except going up hills on trips). We get around 9 miles to the gallon. About 2 years ago we took a trip from California to Wyoming , and to our surprise we got 11 miles to the gallon (on an average).

The 4 doors are such a convenience, for our boys to climb in and out, as well as load things into the back seat. On our last hunt trip (it was just me and my husband) we got to our distanation very late . So we pulled to the side of the road, I laid the recliner back and my husband went to sleep in the back seat. No its like your own bed, but we did get rested and it was comfortable.

The turning radious is very poor though. This is because of the wheel base it has. It is from bumper to bumper 19 feet long and is 7 feet high.(ground to top of roof).

The automatic transmission, shifts very smoothly even in 4 wheel drive. It's called a 4 speed automatic.The fourth gear is the over drive which is at the tip of the gear shifter.(by push button).

The four wheel drive is an auto locking hub assy. This means when you engage the 4 x 4 unit the hubs lock auto. Instead of have to get out and physically manually lock the hubs. At first we were skeptical, but it prove to be very efficient, and came very much handy during a snow storm.

The tires are 16 inch, but , they are cheaper to replace than our daughters mazda sport tire.

Out side of general maintenance oil change, lube, tune up etc) we have had no problems with this truck.

When we go on trips , our shortest trip is about 2 1/2 hours one way. This truck is comfortable to ride in.

The pay load as you have read earlier is excellent, with all that we haul and tow.

You can get this truck for about 20,000 now we paid new 33,000. And after 52,000 miles and 3 years later, we feel that this truck is holding some value. We will keep this truck for many more years to come.
