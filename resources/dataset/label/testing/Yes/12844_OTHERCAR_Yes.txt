            Detailed Sport-Coupe Information

BODY: 
     
     The body design is an awesome alternative to the Excel, Honda's CIVIC/CRX, or Mazda's 323 for the "C" level Asian / American cars. Finding quality 3rd party after market add-on's is somewhat difficult; forcing you to order kits directly from Korea (you knew Hyundai was not Japanese, right?). Sleek, sexy styling had me bought at first sight. Rounded front end, headlights that wrapped to the side of the car give it a more modern look. The addition of a spoiler reduces vibration after 90mph from rear end, and looks awesome! Overall the body has a grunty stance like a bulldog and is lower (stock) in the front giving it a little bit of a mean look.

Engine: 

     I own the xxEX/EG? model engine (unspecified whether its 1.5L-1.8L in size/HP?!), It's stock somewhere around the 138 HP range after upgrades, direct air intake with a 2" butterfly (upgradeable to 3" with solid aluminum block throttle body), stock models feature a cold-air-intake located directly behind/under the battery. This model also features a 12 Valve inline 4 cylinder. Lot's and Lot's of upgrades can be done to this engine! Computer upgrades, direct air intake system, throttle-body/intake, headers, exhaust! You just need to know where to look. Don�t be let down when people tell you they don�t know anything about this car - there�s a lot to be learned! Overall the engines got pep when you need it from a dead stop, but not so much while on the freeway.

Performance / Racing SCOUP�S: 

     I race my SCOUP against HONDA Accords/Civics/CRX's, Dodge Stealth's/Turbo Caravan's Ext. Only loosing to a 225HP accord and a 400hp 1974 Camaro with a Chevy 350 small block (not fair!). This cars fun and exceptionally quick! The oversized engine and light-weight frame gives it the ability to *sprint* very quickly. Only hang is top-end-horsepower after 3rd gear. The lack of horsepower won�t let it keep up after you hit the 40-50mph/4500 rpm mark. The Hyundai SCOUP has a wide front track and a slightly narrower rear track (3-4"), handling is a DREAM! Don�t be afraid to take on your accord counterparts! The front wheel drive & use of proper tires; you can out-handle ANY non-front wheel drive Honda with ease, taking those 30mph turns at 50+ mph. The rear track will break if you push it too hard. My racing rule of thumb is not to exceed a turn more than 25mph faster than is posted with a 93� SCOUP. I have lost control of this car 3 times - loosing total control (only due to my fault). But with the right practice and patience, you can regain control as I did in speeds in excess of 100mph. While racing a Honda accord the guy I was racing slammed on the breaks; I lost my rear end, fish-tailed, and was almost forced into a 360. Luckily the SCOUP has awesome breaking power without skidding out of control and locking up, let me re-align it back on the street and regain control, and with bald tires.

Reliability:

I have 100,000 miles on my 93� SCOUP, I put 4,700 miles on it driving from Ft. Lauderdale Florida to Redding California in March of 2002. The Hyundai SCOUP got the checkered flag and made it. No breakdowns as long as I have owned it. Thus I put 40,000 of these miles on it but keep it professionally maintained myself. I get 25 city / 30 mpg freeway on average.

I have driven my SCOUP on-road & off-road. On dirt trails that climb mountians here in Northern California as well as snow. On Sandy pavement in Miami. Never loosing control and always a comfortable, reliable ride.

I hope this ambient information helps out with the questions people generally DON�T answer. 

Good Luck.
