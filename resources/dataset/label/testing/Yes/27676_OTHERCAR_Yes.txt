            I have been involved with photography since the late sixties, and I have always followed my hobby/avocation with great interest.  I have owned numerous types of cameras (Minolta, Olympus, Canon, Ricoh, etc.) and accessories over the years, and I am no stranger to a darkroom.  Counting my Mavica CD-1000, I have owned 4 digital cameras (3 Sony, 1 Olympus).

I purchased a Sony Mavica MVC FD-95 in July and I was very pleased with its features, versatility and overall image quality. However, I encountered several drawbacks (e.g. severe JPEG compression which spoiled several photos, limited floppy disk capacity) which left me somewhat disappointed. Consequently, I decided to exchange my camera for the new MVC CD-1000 as soon as my vendor received one in stock.

After using the CD-1000 for several weeks, I believe my decision to exchange cameras has been vindicated. All of the same &quot;loves&quot; that I had for the FD-95 are still there, but enhanced by the high-capacity storage of the CD-R drive. In addition, the already good image quality of the FD-95 has risen to a new level of excellence due to the reduction in JPEG compression artifacts (Note: I have yet to try the TIFF mode because I am so pleased with the 1600 JPEG mode).

The combination of 10X optical zoom (2X digital rarely used) with macro capability has enabled me to take some exceptional nature photographs. Test prints (up to 8 x 10) are indistinguishable from chemical-based photographs, whether rendered on my Epson Stylus 700 printer or via ImageStation.com (Ofoto).

I have been able to read the CD-R disks (without finalization) in any PC CD-R or CD-RW drive. I will also be able to read the disks in any CD/DVD drive once I execute the finalization process. Interestingly enough, I have found myself doing almost all of my file transfers (camera to PC) via the high speed USB port (I will be glad when Sony offers a Windows 2000 driver, though).

I am pleased to report that the CD-1000 offers EXIF data recording capability, although this feature is not documented in the camera manual. I have also not seen this information available in any published reviews.

Some reviewers have criticized the size and weight of the CD-1000, I find that it fits my style perfectly. During my most recent camera search, I rejected several excellent (and higher resolution) competing models (e.g. CyberShot S70, CyberShot 505V, Olympus Camedia 3030) due to the small size of their LCD screens and their controls.

Overall, I find this camera to be an excellent blend of photographic art and computer technology. It is emminently usable by persons of all experience levels and backgrounds.

What I love about the CD-1000:  Excellent zoom optics - Steady shot feature renders the 10X optical zoom truly useable - Seemingly limitless storage capacity - USB connectivity for high speed data transfer (from the computer's perspective, the CD-1000 becomes another R/W disk drive) - Exposure flexibility - Size... like the FD-95, the CD-1000 feels like a camera - Control layout and functionality - Pseudo-SLR viewfinder - Large LCD, with excellent menu system - TIFF capability - MPEG movie capability... I particularly like the 320 HQ movie mode - amazingly fast cycle times for 1600 best quality shots  

What I do not love about the CD-1000:  Shutter freeze limits action shots - limited 320/320HQ record times - Limited distance using built-in flash, although can be compensated for through the use of the optional external flash unit - absence of a Windows 2000 USB driver - absence of faster shutter speeds (greater than 1/500 sec)
