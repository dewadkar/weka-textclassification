            I again did not buy this SUV.  I rented it on a recent trip to the Mtns.  The wind was extremely strong and gusty, this vehicle took the wind by storm and told it who was boss.  The Gas mileage was descent for the size.  The control for the stereo are on the steering which was somewhat convenient.  The heat and cool controls were easy to figure out.  The comfort was by far one of the best.  You feel like you are in something much larger than what you are actually in but you are not in what it makes you feel like.  I kept on thinking I was in a Surburban.  I was glad to see I was not.  The ride was a comfort level of ten.  Room was extremely satisfying for the needs which I was renting this vehicle.  Anyone who wants to but a SUV has no choice but to test this and the Explorer leave the Chrysler Cherokee to the Yuppies.  Test it Love it Buy IT!<br><br>
