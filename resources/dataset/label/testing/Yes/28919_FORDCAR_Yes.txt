            As the rest owner of my first Ford product I highly recommend the Ford Explorer 2dr Sport to any one wishing to buy a midsized SUV.  The Sport has more then enough power to handle both and hyway driving and has some nice creature comforts as well.

With the sport I do not feel left behind on the hiways as I did when I drove my Jeep Cherokee.  Even though both vehicle have the same size motor, 4.0L the V-6 does offer more power the the in-line 6 that was in my Jeep.


The interior space of the explorer is also more roomy and the rear seats are easier to get into then those of the Cherokee.  With the 60/40 slit rear seat in the Sport you can haul your stuff alot easier.  Also the fact that the entire rear hatch on the explorer is metal compaired to the fiber glass hatch on the Jeep is better.  With the openning rear window you can still gain access to the rear with having to open the entire hatch like you do with the Cherokee.

For the value the Explore comes out on top.<br><br>
