            When I split with the husband 7 years ago, I pulled out of Japan with 2 little boys and one suitcase.  One of the first things I had to take care of was buying a car, so I could get to a job and get the boys to day care for that first year.

Some things I had in mind at the time were that I needed a safe car that would work well with kid car seats (the boys were one year and four years) and also good on gas mileage to keep costs down over the long haul. Since my old Mustang (I drove it for over 300,000 miles) did not have car seats or AC, I knew I wanted a good AC too.

In the back of my mind were the following experiences:

1.  When I lived in the Virginia mountains, and the temperature went sub zero, the only car in the holler that cranked up and drove OK in the snow was my aunt's Toyota Corolla (70s model I think).  My aunt jumped off all the neighbors and me too with my 68 Mustang.

2.  Since I lived in Japan, I knew that the Japanese cars tended to be more sturdy made than American cars I had been driving stateside. Well, the 68 Mustang was solid as a rock, but that 87 Mustang would fall apart if you breathed too hard. For example, the map light (also called a dope scope) broke in the first 6 months, the lighter quit working, and the electronic door locks had to be fixed 4 times before I unloaded that almost new Mustang.

So, I had been a Ford girl and specifically Mustang.  The first car I bought was that 68, and I got over 300,000 on the car even though it was used and old when I bought it. No, I'm not old enough to have driven a 68 new!

When I went looking for cars, I was pretty sure I wanted a Japanese car with 4 doors and small.  I did look at and consider others like the Geo Prizm (which is said to be the same as Toyota Corolla but it's not--my friend had one the same year and it was not near so well made).

For about $7,000, I got a 92 Corolla in 1994 with 50,000 miles on it.  That actually was the max on what I could spend on a loan in just my name as a single mother and just back in the States. Even though my credit has always been good, it was hard to get a loan I must say.

This has been a great car, and I've put over 100,000 miles on it on top of that 50,000 when I got it.  During that time (7 years), I've never had any major problems with the car.  

Here is what I love about the car:

Although the car is small, it holds quite a bit (square type body and trunk). It is also 4 door, so it was easy to get car seats in the car and buckle up. For two young boys and myself, this is a nice size. 

The gas mileage is good. I get between 30 and 35 mpg in the old Corolla.  A fill up in NC runs about $14 though I never run down empty. I think the tank holds 12 gallons.

Construction is sturdy and hold up even with kids.  

As far as the insides, I had to get the air breather replaced. Apparently the older model Toyotas did not have louvers in the air breathers and most cracked.  That was not expensive--maybe $75 to get the new breather.  

Other than general maintenance like oil changes and belts, I recently got a new muffler and got the brakes redone. This was at 150,000 miles though and the costs on those jobs were $150 and $140.

On the interior, everything is well made.  The ash tray in the back did pop out and won't stay in well.  The glove compartment tends to stick. Other than that, no big problems at all other than an occasional soda getting spilled.

On the downside:

Size.  I don't notice the small size. But I do have a really tall friend.  He has to move the seat all the way back and then the kid in the back behind him doesn't have much room. On my side I drive with the seat all the way to the front, so the room behind me is good.

Air breather.  Older models have been replaced or will need to be.  Not expensive though. My mechanic said that was the main thing he has to replace in the older Corollas.  I think they added the louvers in 93 or 94 and took care of that cracking problem. You'll know you have it if the car starts to sound like a tractor.

No air bags. The 1992 does not have air bags. It is solid and sturdy but small.  I don't know how this car would fare in an accident, since I have not wrecked my car.  Insurance rates are low, so I would guess this is not a big accident car.

Carpet and seats. These are kind of low grade on the material.  Maybe some models are better.   It is hard to get a really nice and clean look when vaccuming or wiping down the interior. The carpet reminds me of what is in the trunk on other cars or the kind of carpet you see in a nursing home (flat). On the other hand, this is some durable stuff and does not get holes.  

Investment . . .

If you noticed, I paid about $7000 for this car almost 10 years ago. The selling price now is $5000.  When I bought the 68 Mustang, I bought for $1000 and then sold for $2500.  So, it does pay to shop around and get the best car you can.  When you decide to upgrade, then you get a bulk of the purchase price back if you take good care of the car. One tip on that is to go the same mechanic every time, so that he can tell a new buyer about the car.  My mechanice said he'd be glad to do that when I'm ready to sell (if I sell it).

As far as the 1992 model, it is getting pretty old now.  You'll want to check the mileage and ask about the repair history.  If you got one like mine with only the second owner and taken good care of, then you would have a solid deal at the $5000 though I would probably sell a little lower in this area and with some McDonalds spills in the car.

Overall, I am really thankful I got this car and I would sure consider Toyota Corolla when I look for another car.  You never know from year to year, but Corolla has been awfully good for an awfully long time.

This is not a flashy car. The photo here at Epinions is not a 92 Toyota Corolla. The 92 is the last boxy shape year.  So, look at new Corollas and just imagine them boxed off rather than curvy on the edges.  That would be the 92 or older.  If you want a good, reliable car, then this one just can't be beat.
