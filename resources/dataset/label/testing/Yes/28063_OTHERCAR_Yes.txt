            We were looking to trade up our faithful family car, a 1992 Crown Vic. I wanted a full size car, with a large trunk, and less than 2 years old used. After searching and searching for another Crown Vic, my wife suggested an Impala test drive. This car is roomy, and has a BIG trunk, so that met my initial expectations. She was hooked after the first test drive. The price was a BARGAIN for a low mileage, loaded LS, so we went for it.

This is my first GM car, and I may be too critical here, but my contacts with the dealer have not been satisfactory. After several months of ownership, the KNOWN defect of ISS 'clunk' happened (Intermediate Steering Shaft needs lubrication). In all my years of long term car ownership, I have never owned a car that required a steering shaft lubed. Anyhow, calls to my dealer seem to fall on IGNORANT ears; they seem to be clueless of the defect, or the GM posted fix. They are not knowledgeable, nor helpful with the product they are supposed to support.

I am pleased that I am getting a consistent 25MPG around town on 89 octane, and am satisfied with the car's trunk and roominess. The convenience features such as keyless entry and all power accessories (including a built in home link) have already spoiled us.

The integrated radio antenna makes AM reception poor, and I expected a better sound from a top end CD player with so many speakers.

As a really low priced used car, there is quite a bit for your money. This car was priced under the comparable Sable we had looked at, so for that reason alone, I do recommend it. Having said that, I hope you will receive better dealer support for the long haul.

UPDATE 24 OCT 2002:
Just had another bad dealership experience. They kept the car for the entire day, and said they couldn't get to it because some mechanics were out sick. OK, no problem, but then they said they might not even get to it the next day. OK, I'll just pick up the car.
When I pick up the car, there are black scuff marks on the hood, almost looks as if shoe heels have scuffed up the hood. Then, when I get inthe car, there are three black, greasy marks on the carpet. ALL THIS AND THEY DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT MY CAR? They treat people as if they have too much business to even care, and they drive the cars around their lot without any respect (squeeling tires, slamming them into park before they stop, bumping from drive to reverse, etc). I WILL NOT GO BACK!
When will the American dealerships realize that a product's quality is sometimes in the service and support?
