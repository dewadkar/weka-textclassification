            I purchased my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited a few months ago with the Quadra-Drive and the 4.7L V8, fully loaded and I must admit that this SUV is the best of the crop.  I also looked at others including the 4Runner, Pathfinder, M320 and LX300 and none of them even comes close with respect to price, performance or drivetrain.

The V8, although quite a gas guzzler, it performs well and so far (5000mi) not a single hitch or problem with anything...  It is very smooth and power delivery is strong in both the low and high end.  The multi speed automatic is great for both relaxed driving and hard driving.  The suspension is also firm enough for hard cornering but soft enough for those quiet rides with baby !!  I haven't yet been able to test out the Quadra-Drive system, but will post an update when I do.

Exterior is clean with fit and finish extremely well done.  All the doors have that solid feel that none of the imports seem to have.  I just love the styling of the new 1999/2000 with respect to the back door/window and front end (lights and grille).  The only thing that seemed out of place in this extraordinary SUV is the gas filler door - it is right out there in the open - couldn't Jeep fit in a remote gas filler latch inside the cab so that people like me wouldn't have to purchase a keyed gas cap for security ?

Interior is very cavernous, at least to me.  The back seats can easily fit 4 people with ease (although only 3 seat belts are available). Both front and back seats are very soft yet firm - very comfortable !!  The split 40/60 back seats are easily folded.  The power heated front seats are a must to have !!

If you are looking for the best all around car with 4WD, this is the cream of the crop.  Stop looking elsewhere as this is the SUV of choice.<br><br>
