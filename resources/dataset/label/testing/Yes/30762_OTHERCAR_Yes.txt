            I bought a Olympus Digital Camera D-340R about 4 months ago.  First when I got it I followed the directions and installed the software.  Well the next thing I know I am spending about 3 hours trying to figure out why the pictures were not downloading to my computer.  Then I spend another 2 hours on the phone with tech support.  Now so far the only good thing about this product was the tech support.  Then once we got the problem fixed the real product came out.  I mainly use the camera for Ebay so the first thing I did was pout things on the web.  The camera takes wonderful pics.  It is an ease to use very elementary.  I recommend this camera to everyone but I also recommend you buy I lot of batteries because this camera eats them up.  So before you buy this camera make sure you order a crate or two of double AA batteries.  Have Fun!!
