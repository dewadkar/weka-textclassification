            This is a sweet, and sassy little car! We test drove many makes and models before settling on this one.
 One of the number one things that we were looking for, was ease of getting into and out of the car. This one was at the top. We did not feel as though we were climbing down into a hole, nor did we feel as though we were crawling out of one, when  entering or exiting the vehicle. You would not know, by looking at the outside, how much room there really is on the inside.
 
  There is much to be said for the drive-ability of this car. It is very responsive to the touch, corners like a dream, will turn on a dime, and, give you back change. There is good acceleration for a small motor, it won't plaster you to your seat, but it will get out of the way of traffic. 
 
  It would be nice to see more gauges for oil pressure and that sort of thing, but we found that just isn't available in almost any of the cars today. I would have been willing to pay a little more for the option of lumbar support in the seats, but unfortunately for me, that was not a option. The only other thing at this point that I have to say against this car,is that, in my and my husbands opinions, this is an evil looking car with the shape of the headlights, and the driving lights. But we purchased one, and we love the way it drives, and so far, we would do it again.  

   I have discovered that, unlike cars and pickups of just a few years ago, I would have a hard time locking my self out with the motor running. This car has automatic door locks, but they will not lock automatically until I put the car in gear to go. That is a sweet feature.              <br><br>
