            I bought my 1996 Buick Regal Limited in 2000 with 75,000 miles upon it.  It is a beautiful car with a very luxurious interior.  It is suitably quiet and I cannot hear the engine unless I am near full power.  It rides good, handles well and has plenty of zip.  The 4 wheel anti-lock brakes and duel climate controls are very nice to have.

The reliability has been good, but not great.  The car now has 105,000 miles, and in the 30,000 miles we have driven it I feel it should not have had this many problems.  The air-conditioner compressor went out at 80K ($500 to repair), the alternator went out at 100K ($65), and an expensive water leak ($150) was caused when I changed the alternator.  On this model, they chose to route the heater water through the belt tensioner, which cracked over time, then broke when I replaced the alternator.

I feel that the air-conditioner failior and the badly designed belt tensioner should not have happened on a car of this quality.  If the Japanese can make cars run 150-200K before needing repairs, we Americans should be able to do so as well.

Overall, I still recommend the car.  The engine and drive train are still in good shape and I think the car will last a long time yet.

Also, one more complaint, the seats are not very comfortable on long trips.  I expected better out of a Buick.
