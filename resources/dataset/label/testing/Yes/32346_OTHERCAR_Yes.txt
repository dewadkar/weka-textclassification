            I got my 1995 Jetta Trek (Yes, the one that came with a great Trek bike and multi-purpose rack) before I went to law school, and I won't need another new car for a while.
The Trek was very affordable (about $18,000 when brand new), and you get a lot for your money.  First, it came with all the usual Jetta features.  One is a nice 6-speaker hi-fi stereo system with a tapedeck (I added a 6 disk CD player that fits in the trunk for about $200, and it has worked out very nice).  People sitting in the back seat have always complimented the sound that comes from the stereo.  Another is sweet glass electronic sunroof.  It's nice to be able to see above you even in cold weather.
In addition, the Trek came with extra features.  First was the aformentioned Trek bike.  Second was a multipurpose bike rack that, with some additional purchases, can be adapted to hold skis, snowboards, luggage, and many other things.  The only drawback to this rack (which you can remove completely) is a slight reduction in gas-mileage efficiency, and a loud humming noise when driving over 40 mph.  The edition also came with silver dashboard dials with black lettering, which looks much cooler than the standard black.  It also has running day-lights and integrated fog lights, which are very helpful on rainy nights.
The driving is very smooth.  Because it is front wheel drive, it handles very well in snow, ice, rain, and other bad conditions.  The engine is not that of a racecar, so those of you who are more into the power thing might be disappointed.  However, the engine is plenty for the average driver, and I rarely have trouble keeping up with anyone on the highway.
So, if you have a chance to get one of these cars, don't hesitate -- you will not be disappointed.  Also, see if the seller also has the bike that came with the car.<br><br>
