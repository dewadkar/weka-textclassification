            This is actually a duplicate of an opinion in the new car section.
We came into this vehicle from the back door. Went looking to replace an aging Honda Accord that had served us well. Found that we disliked the look of the 2000 Accord and Camry as well. Looked at Passats'(another highly recommended car), and it drove and handled great, but it turned out that we had some repressed memories about a VW Quantum that wouldn't allow us to buy it. 
So, now we're in the upper $20's and approaching $30k. Insidious, isn't it? Anyway, we go to the Mercedes, Lexus and BMW dealers, all the time thinking &quot;What the heck are we doing here?&quot;. 
Long story short, Lexus was best choice for luxury feel, M-B and BMW were similar, although the BMW had a better feel and you got more bang for the buck. And after we drove the BMW, the desire for the others went away. 
So, we bought a 323i white/sand/auto/premium pkg with 16in wheels and just love it. I haven't enjoyed driving a car since high school and this is a hoot.
The engineering is excellent. Six airbags in the front, high tensile, low weight steel in the frame, huge brakes rotors and discs, and ergonomics like you would do yourself.
The BMW engines are a book unto themselves. Smooth as silk and designed to give max umph in the mid range. I didn't find out until after that they counter balance the camshaft. That's anal...love it. 
Bottom line, if you enjoy handling first and luxury a close second, you'll certainly be a candidate for the 323/328's. I highly recommend them. <br><br>
