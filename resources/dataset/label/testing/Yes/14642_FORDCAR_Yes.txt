            Before you read this review just remember that this is a practical car. It was not designed to win drag races or beauty pagents, but instead to get you and your stuff from point A to point B.

The focus is a great car depending on your needs: 

1) It is dependable - My family has racked up almost 45,000 kilometres in just under a year in all sorts of driving conditions (extreme heat to extreme cold) So far nothing magor has gone wrong except some unusual treadware one of the rear tires which Ford replaced for free. 

2) It is roomy - for a sub compact car this one sure has a lot of storage space. I mountain bike myself and with the rear seats folded down I can fit my bike and all my gear inside and out of the elements. Plus there is still room for an extra passenger. With the available roof rack installed my packing options are limitless.

3) It has power where you need it - As long as you aren't racing the NASCAR circuit, this car has plenty of power to get you around town and down the highway. If you don't believe me take one for a test drive. I have the 2 litre Zetec engine installed in mine and it is rated at 130 hp. Ford could have went for a more powerful engine but I think it felt that people buying this car were more interested in fuel economy than blistering performance.

Overall this is a great car that'll keep your groceries warm in winter and your bike dry in summer

P.S. About the window vibration, there is one but only at highway speeds with the rear windows rolled down.
