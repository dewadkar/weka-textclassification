            *I have decided to write reviews on the five vehicles at my home at this time. From largest to smallest, these are all some of my favorite vehicles around!*

My model is the 1999 K2500 4 door SLT. The epinions site has this vehicle listed as sold for $30,203.2, HOWEVER, the epinions people didn't include all of the little extras (like a TV and VCR and Playstation, special paint job and brush guard, and lastly a 3 inch lift kit and 4WD) in the price. My Suburban cost $42,500 but it has been well worth it. I originally got cloth seats in it, but I have since had my seats re-upholstered in neoprene (wetsuit material) mainly because I transport the majority of my swimteam in my 'Burban'. The 'Burban' doesn't get great gas mileage, but one should expect that with such a huge vehicle. I frequently call it my &quot;tanker&quot; (I have a &quot;yacht&quot;, a &quot;boat&quot;, a &quot;tug&quot;, a &quot;clipper&quot; and my &quot;dingy&quot;). Could you ever guess why? 

I have only needed to take this 'Burban' into the shop for scheduled maintenance. I have had to get new shocks and struts put on, but that was because of the lift kit I had installed the day after I bought it. 

I had the entertainment kit installed the day I bought it, it only took them the rest of the day and they drove it to my house and left it right on my doorstep. I wouldn't recommend just ANYONE running out and getting an entertainment kit on their Yukon XL (they're not Suburbans now), I had mine installed because I knew that I would be carrying kids around in it all the time. 

One thing to look out for is the fact that if you're not used to driving such a large auto, you might want to test it in a large space with nothing nearby. You know that there is a story behind this...My bestfriend (who drives an Eclipse) tried to move the Tanker and ran over all 5 of my trash cans (which were crushed). She claims that it was because the seat was too far back and she had a hard time reaching the pedals, yet I know that it was because she couldn't see and wasn't used to driving such a large vehicle.

I had my seats re-upholstered in neoprene because I knew that I would be toting wet swimmers all over the South Eastern U.S. and I didn't want moldy and mildewed seats.

For the past 3 years, I have loved this vehicle. It has been a staple in my &quot;Fleet&quot;. I hope that this has proved informative.
