            Spending more time in California, I felt that I really needed to take the plunge to buy a convertible to totally appreciate the wonderful California sun.  I began my search looking at BMW, Mercedes, and even a Corvette.  All of them seemed to be missing something.  I then looked at the Lexus SC430.  I immediately fell in love with it as soon as I saw it.  Before I even sat down in the driver's seat I was blown away by the artistic lines of this car.  Not only did I quickly decide that this was the best convertible on today's market, but I have concluded it is the best car on today's market.

I have previously owned a BMW Z3, while I did love this car, the Lexus is leaps ahead of it.  One of the most impressive features of the Lexus is the lack of road noise that is almost a constant present in all convertibles.  In the Lexus, the wind noise magically disappears.  This is a very impressive piece of engineering.  That leaves me to enjoy the totally astounding sound system.  There is no car sound system that comes close to the one on this Lexus.  

I have to admit that during the course of my many driving adventures I have had my fair share of driving mishaps.  I have been lost in strange cities and rural areas more times then I would like to admit.  That is why I love the GPS navigational systems that more and more auto makers are including on cars these days.  On the Lexus, it is an option that is well worth the price.  It has saved me a lot of time many times.  Especially in California where I am still getting used to all the different areas of Los Angeles.  Also, curing some of my other traveling adventures is the run flat tires that is part of the navigational option package.  I am always having flat tires.  I usually end up either calling the roadside assistance people or waiting for someone cute to come by a change my tire.  Although, I have yet to have use the run flat feature, I feel very safe knowing that it is there.  Which leaves me to concentrate on more important things - primarily myself.  Who could be more important?

The only negative thing I can think of...Well the back seat couldnt hold anyone for a long ride I am sure of it, who would even want to try.  So my fan club will just have to arrange their own transportation :)

I give the Lexus SC430 a resounding five stars and recommend it to everyone - it is well worth every penny.
