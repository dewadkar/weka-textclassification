            Toyota seems to have succeeded in fulfilling the sport/touring sedan niche nicely. My Solara (not my choice, provided me by my company) was a huge surprise to me. Based on its conservative styling, I expected the boring but incredible reliability and adult-oriented aspects of my mom's Camry. 
Wrong.
Folks who believe the Solara is a barely dressed-up Camry ought to forgo the 4-cylinder test-drive and examine the 6 cylinder instead, for they are misguided. The Solara is its own man, a great choice for the long-distance commuter. There is very little this car won't pass, and mine veritably sips gas. 
Of course, a family car the Solara is not. The back seat is difficult to access, although compared to other two-doors, the Solara's back seat is large and comfortable. The car is quiet as a mouse on the road, although if you opt for the moonroof, popping just the back of it open is a bit loud.

All in all, the car is a joy to drive and would do nicely for the young executive or any sporty empty-nester. Give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed.
