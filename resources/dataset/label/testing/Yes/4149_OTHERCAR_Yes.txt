            We have a 1995 Rodeo we lovingly call our puzu.  There has been a lot of criticism lately about SUV owners but I have something to say to those critics - &quot;Don't judge the basket just because you find one rotten egg!&quot;

See you need to know how to drive an SUV.  It's large and top heavy so you can't corner fast and I was used to that after driving a small little sporty car for ten years.  But my Rodeo does give me the feeling of power and makes me feel like a natural woman!!!

Now for the down-side, the clutch has a tendency to become lose.  You'll still be able to drive it until you can get to a mechanic but it takes a bit of leg strength to push it all the way to the floor otherwise you'll grind your gears.  Also, the check engine light and I think its the CO2 light that lit up within the first few months and we were told that it would cost a couple hundred dollars to remove the instrument panel in order to turn the light off - so we just put electrical type over it.

But all in all it's a very reliable truck.  It's fun and I think it's stylish.  Of course, I don't drive it in New York City.  I keep it down in Florida since that is the type of place to actually drive an SUV. <br><br>
