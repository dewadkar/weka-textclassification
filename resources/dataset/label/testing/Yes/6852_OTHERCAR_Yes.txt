            You <i>know</i> the drill....you want to buy your son or daughter their first car, and you want it to be safe and affordable.  But the cars that were affordable when you were a teen - a Honda or a Volkswagon - are now a lot closer to $20,000 than you'd like.  So, this parent proceeded to check out several different cars for his Son - and settled on a new Hyundai Elantra. 

Why?

 Price was a definite consideration - and the Elantra sure wins on that point.  Nicely loaded for under $12,500...with auto, air and a decent stereo system.  And here's a very nice kicker - it's sporty enough that even a jaded teen thinks it looks &quot;cool&quot;.  And then the driving experience - exceedingly quick pickup coupled with great gas mileage.  He's averaging over 28 miles per gallon in mostly city driving.

What else?

A huge selling point is the best warranty in America currently - 5 years or 60,000 miles - which sure allayed any fears I had about it breaking down and costing me extra for repairs.  The interior is relatively spartan, but the seats are comfortable and the car seats four easily with a decent size trunk.

  There were no defects that we've found since acquisition about six months ago, and two of my Son's friends have purchased Elantras as well and had similar success.  They thought his car looked really &quot;cool&quot;....or perhaps the term these days is &quot;hot&quot;.  Either way....this car is a winner.

Thinking of buying one?  It's a <b>GREAT</b> value for the money, and definitely worth a test drive if you have a need for economy coupled with style.<br><br>
