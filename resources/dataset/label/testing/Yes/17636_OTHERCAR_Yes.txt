            When i first went looking for a  car i figured i would check for american cars because they are cheaper to repair if it ever breaks down. i went to ford but i heard a lot of bad opinions from friends and mechanics and my own personal experience. i had a bronco 2 but that kept breaking down on me. nothing ever seemed to go right with it towards the end so i new it was time to look elsewhere. i went over to saturn first and was very pleased with there sales people. they didnt pressure me into buying anything or offer me any &quot;BIG&quot; deals right away. they told me about all of its saftey features which i took a liking to. i took a test drive and felt really comfortable in it. i was happy with the steering and handling of the car. i drove a saturn once before and wasnt to pleased with the steering but it was an earlier model (when saturn first came out). they have made alot of improvements with it. the seats are comfortable in the front but if you are in the back you better hope you are a short person. not to much room back there, but what did you expect its a sporty car. they never do have much room in the back. the saturn i also found to be very fuel efficient. but i guess i should have expected that going from a bronco 2 (that was dying) to a new and great conditioned car. it is a very nice looking car too. <br><br>
