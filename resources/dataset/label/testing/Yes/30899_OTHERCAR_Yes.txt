            I acquired my little Tercel in 1997.  I was starting grad school and needed something that would chew up freeway miles without making me spend 100 bucks a week on gas.  Toyota came to mind due to its reliability and its history of making efficient economy cars that do not resemble tin cans.

This car was it.

My '91 Tercel is a four door, "luxury" model with a manual transmission and three hubcaps.  Well, every car has a personality, and mine is a bad boy with a missing front tooth (right rear hubcap.)

I had ac installed along with a new cd player.  I can drive all day without feeling uncomfortable in the seats, although I cannot fit my 6'5 boyfriend in it.  This is not a car for those who are tall.  I am 5'3 and can fit in just about anything, so this was not a concern when I was shopping for a car.

Things changed last year when I was in a very serious auto accident.  The end result (and no fault of mine) was to be smooshed between a huge flatbed towtruck (it was a MACK, how ironic) and a huge dump truck.  This has caused me to suffer PTSD (I didn't sleep for four months) and a fear of being in small cars.  I have a desire to be up higher on the road now, and my Tercel doesn't provide that for me anymore.

So, it's time to sell it.  My cousin has been begging me for a few months, anyway.  But, I had to share my opinion that this is a fantastic car.

GOOD POINTS:

*  Reliability - I've had one oil leak and no major problems

*  Economy - An 8 gallon tank fills up for 13 dollars (if you can FIND cheap gas!) and gives me just about 300 miles

*  Looks - Yes, it's old, but it was very spiffy when it came out!

*  Comfort - The front affords me all the leg room I need

BAD POINTS:

*  Noise - These models tend to be noisy while in idle.  I've notice every other model I've seen does the same thing.  NOT fun while waiting in line at the Starbuck's drive-through between the BMWs and Range Rovers.

I'd recommend this car to someone who needs a used vehicle but wants something completely reliable.
