            I bought this 96 Ranger extended cab a few months ago, and so far I'm glad I did.  Originally I was looking for a compact car because I commute about 20 miles every day, and gas prices were on the way up.  But I drove literally every compact (and most mid-sized) cars available, and I just do not fit.  I am a pretty big guy (6'3&quot;), and the cockpit-style front seats of most newer cars these days do not accommodate my size very well.  I typically felt a bit cramped from side-to-side.

So I got the idea of trying a small pickup.  I have always thought that I would like a pickup, but they often seemed impractical because of the passenger limitations (my wife and I have 2 young boys).  But I started looking into small, extended-cab pickups with the idea that we could all fit on those occasions when we HAD to.  I looked at Toyota's, Nissan's, Chevy's, and Ford Rangers.  I decided on a Ranger for the following reasons:

1. Price
2. Reliability (based on Consumer Reports)
3. Looks

Originally I was looking at the 4-cylinder engines for gas-mileage purposes.  But after driving a few I set my sights on a V6.  The 4-banger seemed quite a bit underpowered to me, and that was with NO load.  After a long search, I found the one I bought (4.0 V6) and so far I love it.

The cab is quite roomy, especially if I don't have to worry about somebody sitting behind me in one of the fold-out seats.  With people in back, I need to scoot up a bit, but it's still fairly comfortable.  My kids fit great in back, and they always want to sit back there.

The ride feels about right to me.  It's plenty comfortable for my daily commute, with just enough of a stiffer truck feel.  The 4.0L V6 has plenty of power, especially with the manual transmission on mine.  I have not towed anything yet, but I did haul 1/2 ton of sand the other day without any trouble.

I have only minor complaints so far.  The &quot;Check Engine&quot; light came on for awhile.  I checked the Owner's Manual and it indicated that there was some kind of emissions problem.  I decided to wait it out, and it went off after a week.  Also the back end is pretty light and there are times I feel a little slippage cornering.  In the winter I think some weight will be necessary.  The mileage is not bad for the big engine.  I am typically getting around 18-20 mpg, mostly highway miles but some city mixed in.

I would highly recommend this truck for what I use it for--daily driving and occasional hauling.<br><br>
