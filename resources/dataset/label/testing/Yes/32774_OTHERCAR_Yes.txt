            I have been interested in finding the right digital camera and have been researching for it for a long long time.  I've already had Olympus Camedia 2020 2.0 mega pixel and used it for about little more than 2 years b/f I finally got an opportunity to upgrade my digital camera.  And I am very certain that I made a great decision to buy Canon Powershot s400.  

I am not someone who just goes and buys a digital camera.  Rather, I researched days and nights trying to find the right one.  I searched cnet, zdnet, epinions, all kinds of digital camera review websites, many magazines and was finally able to narrow it down to canon s400 or canon s50.  Both were at a comparable price (around $500) but canon s50 had 5.0 mega pixel.  both were known to have a good picture quality.  However, it came down to which one was more portable and definitely canon s400 had the edge.  

I just came back from my deployment over at Kuwait.  There I had Olympus Camedia 2020.  It took great pictures,  But what I learned over having a digital camera was that portability was very important.  Being able to put it in your pocket without any problem would have helped me take more pictures.  Unfortunately Olympus Camedia 2020 was too bulky to be placed in the pocket.  Then my other officer had Canon s230 and he had no problem carrying his digital camera every where even in the harsh desert environment and the digital camera didn't break down nor had any problem taking great pictures.

so I was able to sell my old digital camera at a very cheap price and I bought the best powershot elph digital camera series which is Canon powershot s400.

Trust me on this: if you have a dilemma of buying a digital camera, go for Canon powershot s400.  It takes a wonderful very clear, excellent pictures.  No problem what so ever.  It is so portable,  you will be so happy you bought it.  Portability will help you capture all the important moments and events.  You need a digital camera that you can just place it in your pocket and then take it out anytime to take a picture.  and compare to minolta dimage xti, or pentax optio s or any newlines of small digital camera, Canon powershot s400 does not fall behind as far as the size is concerned.  It truly takes some of the greatest digital pictures.

I don't think the price is too high.  You can find a great deals all over the internet.  Just go to cnet.com and there will be a list of shops that sell canon powershot s400 for a very good price.  do not go to circuitcity or any of big chains.  they definitely sell it for a retail price which is right now aroudn 499.  You can get it for close to 420.

If I have to say anything negative about Canon s400, it's manual function is kinda hard to adjust and it will not focus well if you want to take the shot without flash.  I figured it out now so I have very little trouble taking pictures without flash when it is required b/c it comes out out of focus.  2ndly, yes, battery life is pretty short but for someone who had olympus camedia 2020 which drained battery like crazy, Canon powershot s400 is nothing compare to it.  and it is rechargeable lithium battery so you can always recharge the battery without anyproblem.  For me, I bought an extra battery so I have not had any problem taking pictures without worrying about the battery problem.

You will not regret what so ever with Canon Powershot S400.
