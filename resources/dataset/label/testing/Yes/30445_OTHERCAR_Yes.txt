            My wife and I purchased a 2000 Corolla as a Toyota Certified used vehicle. We got the CE model that is fully loaded, except no CD player. The car had 13,000 miles on it when we got it and we paid a modest $12,500. This car has continually amazed me since we got it.
We owned a Toyota truck, so I was familiar with the reliability. The Corolla is great for a compact car. The front seats are not only comfortable, but roomy. While making it roomy up front, it may compromise some space in the back, but generally there is nobody in the back seat.
I recently drove on a 610 mile trip, with an average speed of 75 mph (with the air conditioner on), and I got just over 35 miles per gallon. That's just amazing to me. The cruise control was great and the acceleration was certainly adequate. I never found myself needing more power to pass.
Prior to our decision to purchase the Corolla, we test drove the Honda Civic, and the Mitsubishi Mirage. Neither of these cars could compare in acceleration. We also own a full size Chevy truck and a classic Mustang, so I know what real acceleration is. I am definitely impressed with the acceleration from the little four cylinder power plant.
This is a fantastic car at a great price!<br><br>
