            I went into the market looking to buy a late-model Volkswagon Jetta over the summer (2000+) but in the process stumbled over this gem, a 1996 Jetta GL.  I eventually went for it because it was soooo much cheaper.  I've had it for maybe 5 months now, no major complaints.

The previous owners to great care of this baby.  They maintained all required regular service for the 7 years they owned it, and now 100,000 miles later, it's trouble-free!

To paraphrase a line from an Outkast song, "I love the waaaaay it moves!"  For a 4-cylinder, 115-hp engine, this baby is a beast!  I mean, by driving it you would never guess it was only 115-hp!  And it handles like a freakin' dream!  The brakes are fantastic as well.  All the controls are easily reachable, and the sound system is more than decent for such an economy car.

But whether you drive a Ferarri or a Ford, every car has cons.  My first complaint is common in many cars: the cupholders.  The placement is just plain idiotic.  They sit (I kid you not) under the center console so anything larger than a McDonald's happy meal cup runs the risk of spilling on the floor if you make a sharp turn (which has already happened to me).  The cupholders are also too small for many normal-sized cups, including my travel coffee mug.  What a waste of space.  The seats are also a bit uncomfortable.  For short trips it isn't noticeable, but long trips will have you acking for a pillow.  The back seat though, is quite the opposite.  Furthermore, the power steering leaves much to be desired.  Take a drive in my mom's '98 Mustang, and then drive my car an you will find that steering her car requires little work at all, while the jaws of life may be needed to steer my Jetta (that was slightly exaggereated).  And one final complaint: where's the glovebox?  I have never been in a car without a glove box.  I am forced to stick my owenr's manual and other important documents in the space between the center armrest and the seat.

But over all I absolutely love my big, dependable, box.  From the map lights in the backseat, to the power sunroof, to the performance and handling, what's not to like about this inexpensive gem?  I plan to trade it in in a couple of years, but only so I can buy a new Jetta.
