            The Jaguar XKR is an almost perfect car for Jaguar and our time.

Jaguar has gone through many changes over the years. Sir William Lyons started the company to bring luxury, performance, and value together. Under his guidance, some of those most beautiful cars of last century were produced, such as the XK120, XK150, C-Type, D-Type, E-Type, (old) S-Type, XJ13, XJ220, XK180, and the XJ6. From its introduction in 1968, the XJ6 in its various stylings has been the most beautiful saloon (sedan) on the road for over three decades.

Sir William's dream had always been about style and performance blended in an ineffable package. So, it is fitting that Jaguar have produced a car as magnificent and true to the spirit of Sir William as the 2000 XKR.

The XKR is based on the XJS platform. So, it shares roughly the same size with that classic automobile. But, where the XJS had straight lines and angles, the XJR offers sensual curved lines. The look harkens back to the E-Type -- one of the greatest pieces of automotive art man has created. In exterior appeal, the XKR is second only to the Aston Martin DB7V, with which is shares a common origin.

The exterior of the XKR is similar to that of the tamer XK8. The XKR has wider tires, different wheels, a mesh grill, cooling vents in the hood, a small spoiler on the trunk, and red badging instead of green badging. Each difference is slight, but the sum is a more aggressive look.

The interior of the car is state-of-the-art modern luxury car. The bucket seats with multi-way adjust and lumbar support make for comfortable cradles on the longest ride. The driver space is wider than that in the old XJS, and thus comfortable for a &quot;wide body&quot; driver. Of course, Connolley leather and burl walnut abound in the style that only the English have perfected.

Most of the gadgetry in the XKR is top notch. The Alpine stereo system is near perfect. The DVD-based navigation system is easy to use and the display is perfectly located for use. (This is in marked contrast to the completely insufficient display used in the XJ series cars). The phone is the only black mark for the car. Though the voice activated interface to the phone is great, the analog phone itself is inferior to the myriad of digital phones available today.

The raison d'etre of any sports car is its power train. On this measure, the XKR again proves itself to be superior. The car has a 370-hp supercharged 4.0 liter V8 engine. The motor provides strong and smooth power. When mated to the Mercedes-Benz sourced automatic transmission, the result is a car which pulls hard and fast. Floor the accellerator and you will find yourself over 60mph in 5.2 seconds; if you don't watch the speedometer, you won't know you are at such a high speed, the car is so deceptively smooth.

Handling on the car is great. The cornering is sure, thanks in large part to the wide, 18&quot; tires. The brakes are strong. At speed the car feels glued to the road until you reach speeds over, say 130, at which point it feels a little light, but still safe and maneuverable.

Overall the XKR is an excellent car. Sir William would be proud.
