               In my job I have the opportunity to spend extended periods of time in lots of different cars. Mostly Accords, Camrys, Tauruses (Tauri?), and SUV's. With gas prices at or above $1.60 a gallon (U.S.) you can bet I won't be driving too many SUV's anytime soon so I took home the Malibu. The first thing I noticed was the styling similarities between the Malibu and the Toyota Camry all the way down to the ignition key in the dash. It's almost as if Chevrolet designers were given a "N" chassis (also known as the Pontiac Grand Am and the Buick Skylark)and were told, "Make us a Camry." The second thing I noticed is how much wider it feels inside than the Grand Am, probably due solely to interior design. The interior controls are well placed, easy to understand and use and large. GM really has improved their interior controls a lot in the past few years. The reliability and quality of the switches are still suspect but you won't have to let your eyes stray from the road where they belong to turn something on or off. 

  The motor, GM's 60 degree 3.1l V6, has been around in one form or another for about 20 years and has proven itself very reliable. It's a bit down on power comparatively speaking, but I hardly noticed. It has enough. Economy isn't too bad. I observed just over 20mpg city and just at 30mpg on the freeway. It's not as refined or advanced as the Honda or Toyota V6 but something to consider is that it has no timing belt. The Honda Accord V6 timing belt replacement calls for *4.2 hours labor. At $75.00 an hour labor rate that's $315.00 plus parts, supplies and taxes. The Camry (*3.0 hours) and 626 (2.5hours) are similar. The back three spark plugs are a little difficult to reach but no more so than most of it's competitors.(Try removing the alternator for easier access)GM relocated the coil packs to a more convenient location on top rather than under the exhaust mainfold a few years ago. Coolant is GM's DEXCOOL orange and requires changing only every 5 years. Transmission fluid is Dexron III and has a similar replacement interval although I personally recommend a 30,000 mi. or less interval for maintenance sake. The transmission has proven quite reliable although it has more internal parts than similar offerings. 

  I would like to agree with one contributor's complaint about the paint quality. GM has hit and miss quality issues with their paint. Just ask anyone who owned a blue W chassis (Lumina, Grand Prix, Regal...) in the early 90's and watched their paint come off in sheets.

  My previous experience with this particular chassis (N) is that they develop rear suspenion noise rather quickly. This particular model is supposed to have a new "hydroformed" chassis and I didn't hear anything out back but watch out for other contributors to start complaining.
