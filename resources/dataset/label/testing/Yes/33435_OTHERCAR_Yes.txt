            The 2000 New Jetta GLX is worth the wait and worth the price!  Don't let these dealers fool you into paying their markup prices however.  The leather, roof, wheels, !!!!VR6!!!!, monsoon system, trip computer make the car comparable to a BMW or Audi in terms of features, and the German styling and handling make it seem like you're driving one.  The VR6 engine has so much power, it will get you in trouble.  I've already been pulled over.   Don't settle for the automatic, the 5 Speed transmission is too fun to drive.

Oh the rain sensing wipers are fun too...<br><br>
