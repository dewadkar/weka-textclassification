            The Canon Powershot A50 is the best digital camera I've seen for the price you pay. Unless you feel like paying a whole bunch for features you don't really need the Canon A50 is the best digital camera on the market. 

I purchased a Canon A50 in January of 2000 after looking at and reading reviews of many cameras. Everything I read about the Canon A50 said good things about it and now that I've used it for several months I agree. The camera takes excellent pictures in different kinds of light. The picture quality of 1280x960 is plenty good. I've printed pictures that I've taken using the A50 and the pictures look just as good as regularly developed film (that might change depending on the printer - I used a color laser).

If you're not sure about getting a digital camera because of the fact that you want you're pictures developed, there are several places that will develop digital pictures. Two that I know of have offers right now where they will develop digital pictures for free (www.ofoto.com &amp; www.shutterfly.com).

Back to the A50, another feature of the camera I like is the size. I have the carrying case that Canon sells for the A50 and it fits snugly around the A50 with room for a spare battery. This means I can carry the camera and a battery in my coat pocket, and I don't have to lug around a huge camera bag over my shoulder.

The LCD on the back of the camera is excellent. Some digital cameras that I've seen have an extremely slow refresh rate on their LCD's. The A50's is almost like a miniature TV - it is not choppy at all.

I would suggesting the Canon A50 to anyone looking at getting a camera. I would also suggest buying the rechargeable battery pack and some type of Compact Flash adapter for your computer. The battery pack will make taking pictures completely free because not only do you not have to worry about film, you also don't have to worry about batteries. A compact flash adapter for your computer will allow you to transfer pictures from your camera to your computer much more quickly than plugging the camera directly into your computer. These two extras will cost you a total of $120 or so.
