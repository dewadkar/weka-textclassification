            I love this site.  I can tell others what I love about my DODGE CARAVAN.  Like I say, what's not to love.  
   From the beautiful design and wonderful silver color with red pin striping, to the burgundy interior, it is the most comfortable hunk of metal and wheels this mother has ever had the joy to own.  
   I find it is economical to drive.  The money I save on gas affords me some more garage sale shopping!  I always have room to haul anything I purchase.  Look out when you see a line of Dodge Vans, they are almost always heading out to a wonderful garage sale.  My daughter says she follows the vans to find the sales on Thursday morning, they are more accurate than the evening paper!
   Some people, such as young people, think owning a mini-van is for old folks and huge family people.  I admit that is one of their attributes.  However it seems that every time my adult children want to go on a trip and save money on gas, and have lots of room they come to Mom to borrow the Van.  I always give in, but I get the raw deal, because I have to drive their sports cars and SUV's to my sales.  They shouldn't ask on a good sale weekend!  
   I have owned four DODGE MINI VANS, have loved every one.  The first one my neighbor talked me into selling it to her.  I felt sorry for her, she had three school children, and also was a baby sitter for half the county.  She drove the wheels off that van.  When retired, it had 300,000 miles on it.  
   My second one I loved equally well, but it had problems when I purchased it and had to return it.
   I would not settle for anything less than a DODGE MINI VAN so we looked and looked and finally found another one which was the same year as the first one I owned.  I drove it many miles and at 75,000 miles had to have transmission fixed.  This is a drawback for the van's.  At around 75-80,000 miles all of mine have had to have transmission repair.  They are still the best on the market as far as I am concerned.  We had it repaired, and one of my son's has always borrowed it more than any of the rest, as he has his own business, and we decided it was time for him to buy it instead of borrow it.  He was happy to do so.  Now I have to look for another one.
   It must have taken two months for me to find another DODGE MINI VAN.  It was then that I realized it is hard to find them because people just don't give them up when they have them.  I did find one, which is the present one, with the burgundy color inside, which I love. It was a one owner and the owner's husband had died, and she was elderly, and wanted to give it a good home. It was love at first drive, and we have only been separated for the 78,000 transmission repair job.  Her week in the repair shop was hard for me to bear.  I do not loan my DODGE MINI VAN to anyone now, I just say I can't bear to be away from her. Get your own DODGE MINI VAN! 
   I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY WITH ANY OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLES, I would recommend DODGE MINI VAN'S  to anyone wanting to purchase a wonderful ride.  The handling is magnificent, and you can't beat the comfort and gas mileage.  They are easy to get in and out of, and can haul all the cargo you can put in.  With the double seats in the rear, the seven seater is a great family van, and the seats are easily removed to make a business trip, or use as a moving van.  There isn't a better van on the market in my opinion, and I know there isn't a better value! 
   I am looking forward to the next 100,000 miles on my DODGE MINI VAN.  We are going to California again in a couple of weeks.
