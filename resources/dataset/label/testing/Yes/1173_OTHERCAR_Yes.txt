            I bought this vehicle because I needed a reliable, cheap car.  I was looking at used cars because I was intent on getting at least a V6 since I drive lots of miles and tend to have a heavy foot.  My dad works for Chrysler and convinced me to look at the Neon since he could get a employee discount.  I went and test drove the automatic (since I couldn't drive a stick) though I knew I wanted the 5-speed.  Learning to drive a stick on the Neon was quite easy and many of my friends have commented on the smooth, easy shifting.  I also should state that I wasn't big on buying the Neon because many of my friends have them and have had mechanical failures. Besides that the lack of performance coupled with the wind nose would annoy the hell out of me.  But my dad said all of the mechanical problems and winds noise where fixed.  I have found that to be true thus far.  And much performance is added in getting the 5-speed transmission.  

So I bought one.  I have loved the car and it is sooo fun to drive.  That is the thing I love most about the car, it is truly fun to drive.  I couldn't ask for more performance from a V6 (I've beaten a 300M in a race, and that car is a V8, though it won't keep up with a Firebird, I've tried).  The cornering is excellent.  I've taken my car through corners with absolutely no effort while my friends (some of which drive older model Neons) complain that their car isn't making it through.  Visability is fair.  As someone else commented the beam between the front and back door gets in the way as does the front beam on the passenger side.  The car does burn oil at speeds consistently above 90, but not much.  Wind and engine noise is nonexistant.  Someone complained about appearance, but I would recommend adding the aluminum wheels.  They really set off the car and the upgraded tires hold extremely well.  One complaint I do have is when the car is loaded it lacks in performance.  Also, with the new air conditioning regulations the car is left without power while the a/c is on.  

I am also pleased about the amount of room in the car.  The people who designed this car thought of everything.  The cupholders are convenient and the armrest is positioned well in relation to the gearshift.  The back seat has tons of room.  I should know, I've moved myself two times and other people two times with my car. The back seat has more legroom then the older Neons.  It has close to the same amount of room as many family cars.  I've also made numerous 4-6 hour trips and have no problems with driving comfort.  It is probably the most comfortable car I have driven that distance. 

The car has 20,000 miles on it (purchased in May of 1999) and I've had two problems with it.  First of all both fog lights have already gone out, which is disappointing, but a minor expense (if any at all, this is covered by warranty) and one of my tires bubbled, this was not covered.  But I have had no other problems.  For any Neon owners out there, I am told if you tighten down the heads every 25000 or 30000 miles you will not have head gasket problems.  All in all I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  You get a lot more than you pay for.  Granted it isn't a Cadillac or Corvette, but it is a great value.  Chrysler did well on this redesign.  <br><br>
