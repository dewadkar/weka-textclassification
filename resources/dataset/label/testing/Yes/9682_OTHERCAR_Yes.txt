            I swore I would never own a diesel anything but after buying this Ram 2500 4X4 with the Cummins Turbo Diesel I will never go back to gas powered again. This truck consistently gets 20+ m.p.g. with enough power to pull a fully loaded 4 horse stock trailer and not even breathe hard doing it.
The Ram truck is extremely comfortable to drive with the cab controls all within easy reach of the driver and useable even with gloves on.
The only problems I have encountered with this truck are a gas gauge problem and a tendency for the speed to creep upward when the cruise control was first engaged. Both problems were covered under warranty and were fixed quickly.
I have put 40,000+ miles on this truck in less than a year and so far have yet to be disappointed in any way. <br><br>
