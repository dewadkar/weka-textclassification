            This car gives great value for your dollar.  It is priced only slightly above most economy cars but delivers great style, a sporty ride, a potent engine, and the space versatility of the wagon/hatchback genre.

You have to enjoy driving to want this car.  The engine pumps out a healthy 130hp with 135 lb/ft of torque, but it is the suspension that really makes it feel sporty.  The suspension is very tight, encouraging you to push it in corners.  The downside of that is a fairly harsh ride.  If you prefer a soft ride, I would look at other offerings.  Our car is a five speed and it is easy to operate, except at very low speeds (like in a crowded parking lot) where it is hard to be smooth with the throttle.

There is also a fair amount of road and engine noise.  If you think cars should be quiet, then the Protege5 will not please you.  To me, the engine sounds great, with a kind of high-pitched, mechanical whine.  Of course, I know that the sound of car engines is custom designed by engineers using the intake and exhaust components, and doesn't really tell you anything about the engine, but I guess it is just nice to hear one you like.

The Protege5 is very stylish.  Hunched, angular cars are all the rage right now, and when you throw in the snazzy 16" alloy wheels with sporty tires, and standard fog lights, the Protege5 is exactly what young people want their cars to look like.  Of course all that marketing goes out the window when it comes time to buy - a car isn't like a pair of shoes that people buy because they are in style, and I have noticed people driving these cars of all ages and types.  But the car companies like to think their cars are all about demographics and their commercials cater to their target audience, so if you are under 35 and urban, I guess according to them, you'll love the style.  

The interior is also stylish, and especially I like the dash and leather-wrapped steering wheel.  I love the big knobs on the stereo controls.  The seats seem higher than you would expect, which helps with visibility amongst the forest of SUVs and minivans on the road.  The 2003 has a good stereo, with more speakers than the 2002.  I have one major issue with the interior where fashion overtakes function:  like many males, I have a mild red/green colour blindness.  The Protege5 has a red backlit drivers display (the latest trend) that looks cool when it is fully lit up at night, but I have quite a bit of trouble reading it in twilight.  It just looks kind of fuzzy to me, no matter how much I adjust the brightness, and I have to wait until it gets brighter or darker out for me to read it again.

From the passenger side, I find that the windshield wipers leave about half the passenger side windshield uncleared.  A tall passenger will have to look through the rain and snow to see out the front, which is a problem if they are supposed to be helping to navigate.  The driver's side is perfectly cleared.

The neatest part of the Protege5 starts behind the driver, with the generous back seats that fold up against the front seats to form a completely flat trunk space that is absolutely huge!  I am always amazed how much stuff we can fit in this car with the seats folded.  The hatch helps too, because it is very wide and gives a big opening to load stuff.  When the seats are up there is lots of room for back seat occupants, but the trunk isn't so big.  All in all, this car makes fantastic use of available space.  And if all that isn't enough, the roof is equipped for an optional roof-rack.
The car is less than a year old and we haven't had any issues with it, except that we've had bad luck with rocks - two windshields and a fog lamp cracked.  I suppose you can't blame the car for a rock hitting it, but if it keeps on happening I will start to question the quality and construction of those components.  We'll see.

I really think this car appeals to a lot of different people:  driving enthusiasts for the suspension and engine, fashion-conscious young people for the styling, small families for the space and versatility, and anyone who isn't rich for the great value.
