            I have always wanted a Jeep.  In fact, I was going to buy one in 1996, but they were impossible to get with a 6 cylinder.  After the new model came out and production increased, I decided it was time.  I bought a Sahara with the 30" wheel package, ABS, soft and hard tops and automatic.  There are a lot of things I gave up since I traded in a loaded Explorer for it, but I love it.  Everything is manual (top, windows, locks), but that is what it is all about.  Less to break, too.  In the few times I have had this off road, I am amazed at how unstoppable it is.  Last winter I was out in a snow storm where 4x4s were stuck all over the place and I just kept humming along.  The stock tires leave a little to be desired as does the sound system, but these are minor.  The other thing that sucks is that automatic is a 3 speed.  It is not as bad as I expected, but it still isn't as good as a 5 spd.  Gotta watch out for water leaks, too.  Another thing to consider is the noise level, the soft top is noisy at higher speeds, but you get used to it.  Also, the new suspension makes a huge difference over the old models.

If you have to ask why, you don't get it.  This is the most fun vehicle I have ever owned.
