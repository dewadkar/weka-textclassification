            I was looking for a dependable car for college and happened to run across this one.  Since my boyfriend owned a Starion and an Eclipse, which both look great and ran great, but was a little too high for my budget, I looked into the Mirage.  I have had my Mirage for almost three years now and have had no problems with it.  It handles good, doesn't have the get up and go.  The only thing that I had to do was change my front brakes but that was due to my driving all the time.  But other than that everything else is great.  I have a child and she is comfortable in the back seat with a car seat.  I would have liked the back seats to fold down but I could live without it.  If anyone is in the market for a car, I think they should look at the Mirage.  It is very dependable and very inexpensive.<br><br>
