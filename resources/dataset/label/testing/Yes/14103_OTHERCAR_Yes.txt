            We have been looking at trucks for about six months or so now. We have looked at Fords, Chevys, Toyotas and Dodges. When we finally settled on the Dodge Dakota Club Cab. There is five of us so this truck was just right for are family. 

The seat in the back if perfect for the kids. They are ages three and a half, one and a half and four months. So we needed something that their car seats would fit in and still give them leg room. And this truck did all that and more. 

We bought this truck used, it is a 1996. But still looks new and runs new. We have had it for a little over two months now. And we are nothing but pleased with it.

It is also a great truck for hauling things. It really came in handy when we were helping my brother and his family move. If you are thinking about buying a truck this is the one to buy. I'm sure that you will be as happy with it as we are.
