            Background:
   I purchased my used Silverado, Extended Cap, 4 x 2, Short bed truck in 1998.  It was 2 years old with 26,000 miles.  It was still under warranty from the dealer when I bought it.  It had a bed liner, Tape/CD player, Split Bench and power everything.  I purchased it from AutoNation.  I traded it in 2 years later at 57,000 miles.

Likes:
   The truck performed very well overall.  There were a few minor things that began to not work (windshield wiper circuit board, power door lock on passenger side) after a few years, but other than that, the truck held up.  I used it many times to haul material from Home Depot to my house for furnishing my basement.
   The truck drove well.  I never had a problem with the transmission, brakes, tires or air conditioning.  The truck would bounce a bit when going over a speed bump when unloaded, but not really a concern.  I loved the CD and tape system.

Dislikes:
   Riding for long hours in the front seat can begin to become uncomfortable.  I liked riding with lots of cold air blowing on me but my wife could never get the vents to NOT blow on here.  They would always leak around and get her.

   Other than that, not much of a problem.  I'd recommend the truck if you were asking my Epinion ... which maybe you are.  :)<br><br>
