             After having a 1996 Plymouth Breeze, which is very similar, I must say the Cirrus is a great step up!! I liked the look inside and out of the Breeze but there are many more options on the Cirrus.

 The exterior as you can see from the picture is very sleek but we spend more time inside, right.  That's what I love about this car. Everything is within easy reach. There are 2 cup holders in the front and 2 in back. The console storage area opens to the right for easy access to the driver, which is a great place to store CD's. It also has a change holder, convenient for the tolls. 

 The bucket seats are comfortable and even adjust in the lumbar area. The fabric is easily washable, which is super if you have kids like I do. My daughter left a chocolate cookie with creamy chocolate filling on the seat. Of course it was about 90 degrees that day. As I was far from home, I feared it would set before I had a chance to clean it. Nope, it came right out with warm water and a little upholstery cleaner.

  Being a V6, it has the power to pass those Sunday drivers most of us dread. Although, I wonder why the speedometer goes to 120 when it won't go any faster than 110...don't worry I don't always drive like that...I always test a new car. It rides just as smooth at 110 as at 55. Gets about 23 miles per gallon when not driving 110.

Other perks are power windows, keyless entry, trunk release switch by the driver seat and the back seat opens for trunk entry. The trunk is a good size too. Imagine 3 women packing for one night...5 bags and a large cooler all in the trunk. 

This is a good size car for a small family. It's not compact so you don't feel cramped but it's not as large as say the Concorde so it's much easier to maneuver and park. The back seat is large enough for 2 car seats or 2 adults, 3 might be a little cramped. 

Anyone single to married with 2 kids would fit nicely into this comfortable, affordable and pretty car.
