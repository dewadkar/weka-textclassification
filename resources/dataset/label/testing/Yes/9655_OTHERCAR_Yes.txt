               I bought a 97 Neon about a couple of weeks ago, I absolutley adore it.  It has totally grown on me and become a part of who I am.  Its very easy to corner, and I being the person I am like to drive small cars.  Its red, and its really cute.  I love the way it is fast, and easy to drive.  
   The only thing I really hate about this car, is the size of the inside.  The back is really small, and I drive a lot of people around and often get complaints.  Sometimes it makes weird noises, and its not as smooth as a drive as my old car.  But even so, I still think the car is a nice car for a 17 year old.  The things I love about it are that it is small, it looks a little sporty, and it has a low gas mileage, or however you say it.  I like it a ton.  
   It is very comfortable for a teenager to drive this car, if you like a lot of room and spacious cars then this isnt for you.  It gets me around and it doesnt look bad either.
