            I purchased a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited in March 1999.  Oh, I loved this vehicle.  It was my first time owning an American made auto and I simply loved this vehicle.  I own a Porsche 944 but didn't want to trade or sale it.  Never-the-less I needed something with more room and I desired a 4-wheel drive.  I'm a female so I didn't want to drive a truck that drove and rode like a truck!  I wanted to be able to drive this daily with ease. That was the first thing that lured me to the Grand Cherokee.  It rides like a car.  It handles like a car.  There is very little (practically not noticeable) SUV swaying like with the Toyota 4Runner or other SUVs.  I have a daughter and it even came with child-safety locks.  The interior is great.  The leather seats are soft and comfty.  Road trips were a joy.  We drove it from Maryland to Florida and I didn't get cramped or anything from being in the vehicle for so long.  Also, to be a V-8 it did really well with gas mileage.  The interior has climate control that is great, the sound system (infinity gold) was great.  During the snow I never had a problem with traction.  I loved that it was full-time 4-wheel drive.  I hate having to make the decision when to shift into 4-wheel drive myself!  Anyway, as you can see I was in love with the Jeep.  Then the honeymoon was over.  I bought it used with about 60K miles on it and in less than a year the transmission conked out.  I then heard from several others that the Jeeps were known for having transmission problems after a while.  Within the time that I did own it, I only had a belt changed and the normal maintenance (oil change/tire rotation) prior to the transmission dieing.  So, I would definitely recommend buying one, just keep in mind that you may have some transmission issues in the future.<br><br>
