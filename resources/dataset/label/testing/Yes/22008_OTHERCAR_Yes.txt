            The LS 400 is a great car. I have a lime green, coach LS 400 and it is on of the best cars I have ever had. it has plenty of power and it rides like a cloud. I have had 3 cars from Lexus and they have really earned my trust. &quot;The LS 400 sedan comes this year with many highlighted standard features. These features include automatic climate control, 10-way power front seats, power windows, power tilt/telescope steering wheel and leather trim upholstery. Heated outside mirrors, Homelink garage door opener, engine immobilizer security system, cruise control and Lexus premium audio system are also included. To add performance, packages such as the Navigation System Package, Premium Package and Nakamichi Audio System Package are available. The LS 400 provides an array of safety features such as a front and rear crumple zone body, front and side airbags, daytime running lights that gives clear visibility under diverse conditions and the High-Intensity Discharge headlights for clear contrast.&quot;<br><br>
