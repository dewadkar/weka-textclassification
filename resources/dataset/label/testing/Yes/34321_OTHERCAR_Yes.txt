            I was looking to spend between 25 to 30K on a nice luxury car, and looked at the BMW 3 class, the Volvo S40, and the Lexus ES300. But of all of those, the Acura TL beat them all. It has every option that you could possibly want, and they are all STANDARD. Unlike the Volvo S40, which is so stripped down at $23K you are just getting an expensive nameplate. Put any of the options you want on the Volvo or the BMW, and you are looking at the $26K range very quickly. At that price, you can buy a TL, and it will have ALL the options, plus Traction control, a 3.2 Liter VTEC V6 engine (which will MOVE this car!) and more.  
I was willing to wait a few weeks for this car to come in, and it was worth it. I splurged and got the Navigation System, and it is really nice, but if you don't want to spend the extra $2k for it, you are still beating any of those other cars in this class.
Best way to tell that it's a great car? Every time someone rides in it, they say the same thing. &quot;WOW!&quot; and &quot;This is my next car!!!!&quot;. This is Honda/Acura quality, so you know it will last. Now every time I look at the Lexus, I just laugh because I know they overpaid for that little L on the hood.
What don't I like? The side view mirrors are a little too high on the doors for me, they sometimes block my view of the roads I am about to turn on to. And that is a VERY MINOR POINT!!!!
I LOVE THIS CAR!!!!<br><br>
