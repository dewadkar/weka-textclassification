            I bought this camera for convenience.  And I got what I bargained for.  With the zoom all the way out I get pictures good enough for my web page or for my online photo gallery.  With the zoom on you would need a tripod to hold the camera steady enough to get a good picture.  I can print the pictures just a little bigger than my thumbnail and still be happy with the results.  But any bigger than 1.5 by 2 inches and the picture is just too grainy.  And that is on the &quot;high&quot; quality setting.  
But the convenience is tremendous.  I can take a bunch of discs with me to a third grade party (for my son's class) and just keep taking pictures.  When the teacher wanted some pictures I just copied a disc right there for her.  I can fill 15 discs on a charge with approximately 20 pictures each and edit when I get home with no developing charge for the pictures that aren't any good.<br><br>
