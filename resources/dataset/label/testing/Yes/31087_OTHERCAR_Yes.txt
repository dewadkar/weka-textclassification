            My wife and I were contemplating buying a 2 wheel drive V8 p/u that could tow either a trailer or 5th wheel weighting a minimum of 5000 lbs.  We looked at Fords, Chevys and Dodges before we looked at a Tundra.  In retrospect, I find this fairly amusing because I at the time owned a Toyota p/u (in fact it was my second one). Once we test drove the Tundra, compared the features, performance and quality it was a no brainer.  I'm not saying it was the cheapest 2 wheel drive p/u we looked at but it was by far the best p/u for the money as far as we were concerned.  Hands down it was the quietest and smoothest riding p/u we checked out.  It drives more like a car than a p/u.  The quality of the workmanship was also up to Toyota's usual very high standards.  The only negative thing I have to say about the truck is that the back seat is not very comfortable, however I purchased the Access Cab not for hauling people but to put &quot;stuff&quot; or our dogs in.  So, I personally don't find it a negative but others might.<br><br>
