            I am a freelance writer, and bought the D40 shortly before going on a weeklong science cruise I was planning to document in magazine newspaper articles. In the year since, I've taken this little camera thousands of miles and even up on Alaska's North Slope -- publishing dozens of photos along the way.

And yes, I'm a writer -- not a photographer. But the camera is good enough (and provides large enough images) to allow me to come back with hundreds of decent shots. It helps that I can preview them in the field.

The first day, most of my images were out of focus, and I was frustrated. But fortunately, I had brought along the (pdf) manual and a laptop, and started reading. Each day, I learned something new -- starting with how to focus by pressing the shutter button halfway down and waiting for a light to go on (I was used to manual SLRs), and going on to everything from white balancing (it makes your colors look right) and spot metering (a way to select the right lighting for your subject).

The delay involved in taking a picture, by the way, is one of the camera's biggest limitations (common among midrange digitals). But you can manage some action shots by using settings that will take several images in a row, rapid-fire -- or even by shooting a  30-second Quicktime. 

I went from my first basic lesson (focus) to learning all sorts of advanced features. Becoming familiar with settings other than automatic is a very good idea, but going completely manual isn't worth it; too much messing with the monitor menu and tiny buttons on the back of the camera, even just to focus. Some day, I'll get an SLR digital, but for now the price difference (and size!) makes it worthwhile to use shutter or aperture-priority settings and just fiddle with one or two things.

 A year's experience with the camera has since taught me some important tricks -- like how to super-extend the life of the batteries by limiting use of the monitor. (I still use it --  but selectively. My batteries last days rather than hours.)

One reason I bought the camera was that it can also function on AAs -- but in fact, I have found the use of AAs to be very disappointing and impractical. I tried to use rechargeables, but after a few recharges, they were  lasting only about 15 mins., which was kind of cramping my style. Same for nonrechargeable AAs. Now I just use the CRV-3 lithium batteries (I always keep an extra 1-2 on hand.) Days of use with no problems. Unfortunately, these batteries can cost about $8 or more apiece -- but I consider it my "film" cost, since the memory card lasts for hundreds upon hundreds of images. Free money-saving tip: Compliment Energizer -- my favorite-- and they may even reward you with $1-off coupons; or try with your battery manufacturer of choice.)

Oh, and as for that warranty -- I've tested it thoroughly. I did need to send my D40 in for repair about 6 mos. in, months after my big adventures, and I was sure I'd done nothing wrong. But the co. told me the camera had sand in it. Thinking back, this could have happened on my N. Slope trip; it was no day at the beach, but it is possible that carrying a delicate camera on a camping trip had had *some* effect. Sand is supposed to void the warranty, but  I did get a warranty repair, so Olympus appears to be somewhat flexible on this point -- maybe because the sand wasn't the actual cause of the problem?? (I didn't think the trip had damaged the camera, but now that I've had more experience with digital equipment, I'm beginning to appreciate it is more delicate than one might think.)

The day I went to the post office to ship off my camera for repair, by the way, I ran into a man who nearly chased me in his eagerness to ask what was wrong with it. You see, he LOVED his D40 and couldn't BELIEVE anything was wrong with mine. I understood his feelings entirely. I carry this camera everywhere.

Things I wouldn't waste money on again include: the AC adapter (for some reason, it doesn't work when you want to download to the computer, which is the main time you'll want it); battery recharger and rechargeable AAs (too bad); a memory card smaller than 128MB (and don't bother with the Olympus brand unless you really, really want to create panoramic images. 

Things I would buy extras of: 128 MB memory card (I recommend 2, each of which will hold 128 high-res. 5x8" images or many more smaller ones);  Smartmedia reader of your choice (1 is enough; saves MUCH battery power if you use one of these rather than download pictures directly from camera); and... (drumroll please)

... another D40 (I know, I know; the C50, the latest version, is even smaller. But the D40 looks cooler and fits better in the hand. 

I just like it.
