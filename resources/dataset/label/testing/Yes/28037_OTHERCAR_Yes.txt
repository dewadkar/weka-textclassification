            I purchased a 2000 Plymouth Neon LX on June 29, 1999.  Since then I love it so much it already has almost 12,000 miles.  I love everything about it.  Ours is black, which is hard to keep from looking dirty  because every piece of dust shows as with any black car, but when it's clean....look out!  It looks really sharp.  We have the aluminum wheels and silver lettering.  We also got CD player, A/C, power door locks and windows.  One feature I love is the windows and doors which are different from my previous vehicles.   There are no power windows in the back seat because of children.  I have two and it drove me nuts when they would play with the windows....not a problem anymore.  And the electric locks automatically lock when you go over 15 miles per hour.  I also like this feature. The six speaker sound system isn't the best I've ever heard, but is pretty good for the price range of the car.  It drives very quiet and smooth and I haven't noticed the sound of wind from the window's edges that I noticed in older Neons.  We have taken this car from Washington D.C. to Madison, Wisconsin and back twice very comfortably. All in all, I would definately buy my car again and plan to buy another Neon when we purchase a new car again.<br><br>
