            There was a time when true appreciation of Camaros was reserved for true car aficionados.

Back in the 80s, when Camaros were underpowered IROCS with tiny wheels and uncomfortable interior, Camaro owners had to take out a second mortgage just to afford to make their pony cars enjoyable.

The early 90s brought a renaissance to Chevy's only surviving muscle car. The boxy look of the 80s gave way to a sleek, powerful machine that was as much fun to drive as it was to look at. After suffering through a bland decade, the Camaro had returned to the American road.

Now, the car continues its storied tradition with a massive makeover that shed some bulk from the car's exoskeleton while more or less maintaining its traditional facade. The new Camaro is smaller and more powerful than its 90s predecessor.

If you're looking for a tight-handling, reasonably affordable sports car, the new Camaro might be for you. But, if you want something that keeps the feel of domestic power from decades past, think about a slightly used '97 model--the last of the full sized, full-bore Chevrolet.
