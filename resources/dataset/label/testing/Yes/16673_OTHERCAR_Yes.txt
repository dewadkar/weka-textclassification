            I have now been driving my Subaru 2001 Legacy wagon for approximately one year. It replaced a Saab 900S so I expected lower performance and fewer creature comforts, and that's exactly what I got. While it is somewhat unexciting I have found it to be completely reliable, having not one problem to bring back to the dealer for. It is also absolutely wonderful in the snow. I thought my Saab was good, but the Subaru is much better, like a hot knife through butter in even 18 inches of snow going up my hilly driveway!
The gas mileage is more than acceptable also. The major drawbacks are the high ambient noise levels when on the highway (although still better than the Saab which are notoriously noisy)and the relatively soft seats that seem to get softer on long rides. I am short and thus there is sufficient interior room, although I wonder if a six footer would agree.
On the whole if you are looking for a reliable wagon that will get you around in even the worst weather you should strongly consider this car. At the price, after one year I still feel it was the best buy.
