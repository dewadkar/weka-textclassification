            I suppose that I might should have waited a few months longer before writing this review since October 28, 1999 was my first experience with this or any Saturn. 

My wife and I were actually out looking for a used car. Boy am I glad we didn't buy the used 1998 Buick we looked at earlier that day. Who needs all of those so-called luxury items anyway? For just a few hundred dollars more and at a lower interest rate on the loan, we found we could have a new Saturn. At no time did I feel like the salesman was trying to pull anything over on me. 

But it was the car that sold me. A lot of thought was put into the design by the engineers to consider what people really want in a car. I especially like the way the rear seats fold down giving access to the trunk. 

The seats are comfortable; the interior is roomy. It has plenty of get up and go. The savings in gas mileage are enough to pay for the difference in insurance, which isn't that much considering full coverage on the Saturn compared to minimum coverage on the old car. 

The only fault I have with the vehicle so far is not with the car itself but with the distance to the nearest dealership. The three nearest Saturn dealerships are one and a half hours, two hours, and three hours away respectively. <br><br>
