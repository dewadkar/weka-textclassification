            I bought a Saturn SC2 two and half years ago and I'm still very happy with it!

First off, my shopping/buying experience went off almost without a hitch. I visited the dealer twice before seeing the apple of my eye.  I bought my car off the lot, spoke with a very nice, knowledgeable salesperson and set up the date I'd be able to sign all the loan papers and take my new car home.  They even set up a time for me to come in, promising me it would take less than a half hour to get everything done.  The only glitch here is they apparently had problems either contacting my employer to make sure I could swing the loan, or the institution who was to grant my loan. I was there for 2 hours that day instead of my expected half hour.  Nonetheless, it was still a very positive shopping/buying experience.

I've taken my car in every three months for her servicing and I've been most impressed by the mechanics and the other service staff at my dealership.  I'm greeted (by name), escorted to the waiting room and brought back to a nice, clean and serviced car. On two separate occasions I have complained that my car wasn't washed very well (as they wash the cars each time they service them)...since my complaints, my car has been spotless.  A couple of times I've also felt like they were taking too long to finish up, but nothing excessive.

I've had only two &quot;problems&quot; with this vehicle since I bought it, one was a recall from the company on the horn and the other was a problem I had with the seat-belt locking up on me.  When I complained that the seat-belt locked in place upon the slightest movement, they replaced the belt.  However, I've since then complained more (as replacing the belt didn't fix the problem and once in a while I get momentarily &quot;trapped&quot; in the belt) I've been told that all Saturn seat-belts are this tight (a safety feature?).  That is the one thing I really dislike about the car...and pretty much the only thing.  Air-conditioner (and I live in the South, so I use it A LOT), heater, defrosters, stereo, etc. are in tip-top shape!

If you're looking for a relatively &quot;inexpensive&quot; (though the new model SC2s with all their options are pushing 20k) car, with solid safety features, reliability, good gas mileage (I get roughly 30 miles/gallon), a nice design, nice pick-up (I can only speak for the SC2), good handling and are an &quot;average-sized&quot; person (I say this because my father is 6'4 and weighs about 275...he has some problems getting in and out of the car, and even when inside, isn't particularly comfortable), then a Saturn is the car for you!
