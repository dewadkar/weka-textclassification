            I used this camera to build the company website that I just recently launched. I don't have a photography background, but this camera taking pictures sure made up for it. Having said that, the camera does everything you'd really want without having to pay a huge price. The flash is so smart that if you try to use it a place that clearly isn't dark it won't work. There are SO MANY features on this camera I don't even know what they are. The resolution is awesome as it is 1280 x 960. I had one of the first generation digital cameras, and that was nothing compared to this one. The manual is a little lacking though in telling you everything you need to know in layman's terms. It's a great camera, it just takes some getting used to. If you get this camera, you'll need to spend some time playing around with the features to truly understand it. When you export the pictures, even though they are at a high resolution, they are really really small. Most of my pictures at the highest resolution average around 6K in size.   <br><br>
