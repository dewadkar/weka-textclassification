                 I had never even considered the I35 until I received the offer for the free Palm Pilot with a test drive.  Since the lease on my 1999 Oldsmobile Bravada was ending, I decided to give it a shot.  I was initially a little hesitant about buying a car, since I have owned SUVs for the past nine years.  However, I absolutely loved the I35!  I shop mainly based on the interior, and the first thing that you notice in the I35 is that the interior is roomy, solid, and OPEN!  The dashboard slopes back and the windows are huge, giving the feel that you can see everything around you.  My test drive route took me on a freshly paved road, as well as a very well traveled one.  The car handled each smoothly and confidently, and when I got to the twisties, the fun began.  Even with the base suspension, the car handles crisply, with only a moderate amount of torque steer.  By the time I returned to the dealership, I was reluctant to drive anything else because I doubted anything could compare to the I35.  I did cross check a Maxima, and the interior wasn't as relaxing or luxurious as that of the I35. 

Acceleration: 10/10
     0-60 goes by amazingly quickly, smoothly, and quietly.  The engine is responsive and emits a pleasant growl under hard acceleration, otherwise it is nicely muted.

Handling: 8/10
     The normal suspension serves up handling that is quite crisp and sporty.  Torque steer is noticeable but not excessive; the handling is slightly better with the optional sport package, but the package does nothing to alleviate the torque steer, and the ride becomes relatively harsh.  On the downside, the turning radius is rather large.

Braking: 10/10
     The brakes are powerful and confidence-inspiring, with a firm, progressive feel.  Standard 4-channel ABS, Brake Assist, and Electronic Brake Force Distribution adds peace of mind.

Ride: 9/10
     The ride isn't mushy or floaty.  Rather, it is firm, taut, supple, and controlled.  Note, however, that the sport package drops the ride to a 7/10, as it makes it harsh.  However, stability control is only available with that package. (Traction control is standard, however.)

Quietness: 9/10
     The spoiler actually improves the aerodynamics, so there is only a trace of wind noise at highway speed.  Engine and tire noise is also well controlled.  There is, however, a mild amount of road noise.  Note, however, that I am very picky in the area of quietness and would only give the ES300 a 10/10.

Seat Comfort: 10/10
     The front seats are exceptionally comfortable and supportive, and the rear seats are similarly comfortable.  The I35 is an excellent vehicle for four occupants.  The center rear seat is hospitable, but not as comfortable as the outboard rear positions.

Roominess: 10/10
     There is a surprisingly large amount of foot, leg, hip, shoulder, and front head room.  Rear seat headroom is the only dimension in which the I35 could see some improvement, but there is still enough so as to keep the hair of the average adult from doing anything but brushing against the headliner.  The trunk is amazingly large, too.

Safety: 8/10
     Standard safety features include: 4-channel ABS, Brake Assist, Electronic Brake Force Distribution, Traction Control, Front and Rear Crumple Zones, Collapsible Steering Column, Side-Impact Door Beams, Reinforced Occupant Compartment, 3-Point Seat Belts in all Positions, Front Seat Belt Pretensioners, Load Limiters, and Adjustable Upper Anchors, Dual Stage Frontal Airbags, Front Seat Side Impact Airbags with Head Protection, and Front Seat Active Head Restraints.  The I35 garnered an Acceptable score from the IIHS, four of five stars for the driver and front passenger in a full frontal crash, four of five stars for the driver and rear passenger in a full side impact, and four of five stars for rollover resistance.  (The last three crash tests were conducted by the NHTSA.)  Overall, above average safety equipment and average crash test results.  Unfortunately, stability control is available only as part of the sport package. 

Fit and Finish: 11/10
     Wow!  There's nothing else to say.  The seams are dead even, and the materials are of the highest quality.  The interior is relaxing, finished in soft-touch plastics, brushed aluminum, thick felt, realistic looking but (unfortunately) faux bird's eye maple, and possibly the best leather found in any automobile on the road today.  (The same fine Italian leather found in Infiniti's flagship Q45.)

Reliability: 10/10
     The car is like a vault, I have had no problems in 5000 miles, and it doesn't look like I will.  There are absolutely no squeaks or rattles.
