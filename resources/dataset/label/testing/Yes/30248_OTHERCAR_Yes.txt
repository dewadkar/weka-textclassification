            It's small, It's blue, and It's cheap.  In saying that remember, you get what you pay for completely with the Agfa ePhoto Smile Digital Camera.

Features for this $80 camera are:

Selftimer/Next Button -- this selftimer has a 10 second shutter delay, and this button will select the next image to erase or preview.

Action Indicator -- It's a green light that blinks as indication that the camera is really working.

Flash/Previous Button -- This will set the flash options to auto/fill-in/red-eye reduction/no flash.  It will also select the previous image to erase or preview.

Display -- This allows you to see the setting in the active mode.

Erase Button -- To see the erase display you press this button.

Shutter Button -- To shoot an image or to confirm an action.

This camera takes 2 AA batteries, either Alkaline, Lithium, NiMH, or NiCAD.  There is a DC power input port, a serial port and a video port connector.  If you want to use a tripod, the mount for it is on the bottom of the camera.

This camera also comes with the Agfa PhotoWise CDROM with Image Editing software so that you can edit and print fast photos.  Complete instructions left me with no questions.

For an $80 digital camera, the photo quality is grainy and dark, but once you get used to taking pictures and its flaky glitchy personality, you can usually get pictures that will work for what you need.  I would tend to think it was a starter camera or for teenagers that want one to use.
