            The 1999 Rodeo is a winner. Except if you are looking for gas mileage. 17 MPG all around ain't great with $1.60+ per gallon. But...that's the only real drawback. 
It handles a lot like a car, and is very stable on the road. Though it's a bit subject to wind due to the high profile, it is not overly top heavy and can take most curves almost as fast as a car (without tipping onto 2 wheels). 
There's plenty of power in the LS 6 Cylinder model, and it cruises nicely at 75...though it probably won't beat out a police cruiser, so keep your eyes on the No U-Turn crossovers on the interstate! It always seems like the rodeo is going slower than the speedometer, so beware the illusion. 
For 99, they got rid of the swing-away spare, firmly attaching the spare to the back door (earlier models you had to swing the spare out before opening the rear door). The rear seat also splits to fold down (unlike older models where the whole seat back was either up or down), and there's more than enough cargo space for most...and if you put the car seat on one side, you can fold down 2/3rds of the seat without removing it.
Overall, I'd give this truck a 4.5 out of 5 (that rounds up to a 5), and would highly recommend that anyone looking for an SUV check it out. It is virtually identical to the Honda Passport, but about $2K less on the average, so unless you want the Honda name on your Isuzu, just stick with the Rodeo.
