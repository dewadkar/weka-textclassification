            I own a 1999 Mazda Protege. I absolutely love this car! For a compact car it has a great deal of interior room as well as good sized trunk. My fiancee who is 6' sits comfortably in the front seat. The back seat is a bit cramped, but not too bad. We recently moved across the country and this car drove great. Very comfortable to drive that long of a distance. I was able to load a computer, monitor and small tv in the trunk with a variety of other items between the trunk and the back seat. The gas mileage is great, even with a loaded car. I would buy another Protege in a heartbeat. No questions at all!<br><br>
