            For the past year and a half, I have been driving a 1995 Honda Accord LX sedan (tan colored). I find the interior not as spacious as the newer models, and the engine could be a bit more powerful, but the style on the interior and exterior is definitely there. If you are interested in customizing a vehicle with aftermarket parts, the Accord has a mind-boggling amount of accessories. In this past year I have begun customizing this vehicle on the inside and out. While my parents and many people deem these expenditures to be wasteful, to me, the Honda Accord is a car built for customizing. The Accord is a popular car, and the investment in aftermarket parts makes it unique. I have enjoyed driving this vehicle, it has been reliable and efficient, and it has provided me with countless hours of enjoyment. <br><br>
