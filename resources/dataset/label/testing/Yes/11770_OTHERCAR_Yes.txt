            My old digital camera is getting old and didn't take such great pic's compared to modern digital cameras.  

So I asked Santa Claus (aka my parents) for a new digital camera. I seen in wal-mart where Kodak had a digital camera/printer combo for sale.  Seen a copy of the pic's took by the camera and printed by the printer so I asked for that set.  

I got what I wanted for christmas. So happy I came home and hooked up the new serial cable to my computer for the camera. That was the easy part. Put the disk the cd-rom to install the software. Couldn't get it to install the software on the disk.  Would just sit for hours and do nothing when I chose to install the driver.  So I downloaded the correct driver from the internet.  After HOURS of frustration I gave up and left the house. When I came home finally the software from the net had decided to work and it was prompting to start the install.  Didn't take long to install the software.  

After finally getting the software installed I decided to test out my new camera..  Half of the pictures kept coming out with lines all through the picture.  Went back and read the directions again and still no changes.  

Couldn't get the printer and computer to work together either. So I took both back since they had been apparently dropped since the printer plastic cover was broke. I got a new set and the camera is working great. 

It has no auto timer which disappoints me. I hate having to ask someone to take a picture of me when I want to send a picture to a friend.  But it does take clear pictures even in my house after dark.  You can tell the color of the clothes I took a picture of to sell on ebay.  

The pictures turn out LARGE when taken off the camera.  You can only get one or two on a floppy disk if you save them in the size they came off the camera as.  I open up my graphics program and edit the size so I can put all the pictures on a disk.  

So far I see nothing spectular about this camera but it does do a good job for what i need it for, which is mostly ebay pictures.  Not a professional photographer so this works for me. Can't tell you how the pictures look when printed since I haven't gotten the computer to regonize the USB printer yet.  Thats another story and another epinion. 

I don't like that I can't use this camera with any software program. I can't pull up any program that supports twain and get my pictures. Can only use the software that comes with the camera and the cable won't work with my other digital camera.  

My sister has the same exact camera and while driving 35 mph through residental part of town she took a picture of a house.  The picture turned out clear like she had stood there and took the picture.
