            The Town cars have held it's own. A car like this cannot be compared to any other. The 5.0L, under the hood is unbeleivable. It supplies the car with more than enough power. The handling of a car this size is very suprising, it seems this is more of a sports car, with the power and the handling. Then the suspension, I don't know how to put it even. It doesn't feel like your driving. It is a perfectly smooth ride. Worried about bumps, potholes...don't worry, in the town car you won't feel them. That doesn't mean it is healthy for your car though. If you are interested in purchasing a town car, the 5.0L is more than enough. And remember this car is not for the old anymore!<br><br>
