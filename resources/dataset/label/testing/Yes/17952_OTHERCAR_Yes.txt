            I purchased a '98 Jeep Wrangler and I enjoy more every day.  If your interested in a All Terrain Machine then you'll be happy and glad with a Wrangler.  I've always enjoyed JEEPS, especially when I first rode in a CJ-7.  I had the most fun.  In the summer (if you don't have cold winters)the best part is taking off the top and doors.  Driving the Jeep without those parts is an indescribable feeling.  The only thing I regret about my Jeep is that I wish I invested into a 4 liter.  I do recommend though, if you live where it gets cold, to get a hard top.  If your purchasing the vehicle for off-roading uses then make sure you get nice size tires.  My jeep came with 28, I switched them though to a 31.  The tires do a rub a little bit on tight turns, but nothing that will harm the alignment of the vehicle.  My Jeep is great in the winter as well.  I have no problems driving it during the snow.  I've also taken it off-roading a lot.  This vehicle had no problem crossing and traveling up and down rivers.  It also was traveling threw mudding terrain and never had a problem with getting stuck.  Jeep has widened the suspension of the vehicle so that it won't flip as easily as they use to.  I have taken turns at unbelievable speeds, even got it on two tires before, but never flipped it.  If that's why you are hesitant on buying a jeep DON'T LET IT STOP YOU.  Just make sure you get the 4 liter.  Oh yea, and don't get automatic, it's not a jeep unless it's MANUEL.  It's  a rugged machine and is enjoyable to own.  <br><br>
