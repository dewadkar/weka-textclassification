            We bought our trooper based on value: big bang for low $$.  Our only regret is not buying the AC package, but in the northwest that's only an issue every now and then.

The Trooper is AWESOME for everything we do: family trips, fishing in rough locations, camping, home improvement...everything!  The welded roof gutters allow a serious rack load up top which really compliments all the room inside.

Driving the vehicle isn't very exciting; it's a 4-cylinder.  However if we wanted a sports car we would give up the utility we have.

A note of major importance:  maintain the older Troopers! It's no secret that valves are a problem on the older troopers--through about 1991.  The cure is to make sure you hit your regularly scheduled services, or at the very least, have the valves adjusted every 15-20K miles as they tighten otherwise and can eventually lead to a cracked head, burnt valve, or worse.  The dealers and private mechanics I know keep valves and heads in stock due to the frequency of the issue.  However they all claim that maintenance is the key.  I have a 1991 4-cyl and haven't had a problem...and it's well over 100,000 miles. 

The newer Troopers don't have this problem, and the warranty substantiates the improvements in all areas.  If you are looking for an all around do-all vehicle, this is it.  We'll buy another.<br><br>
