            I'm fairly new at all this computer stuff so when a friend of mine asked me if I wanted to use his digital camera I was hesitant at first, not wanting to feel like an idiot. Well, I found this camera easy to use. I was uploading pictures on my computer in no time. The camera is light weight and simple to use. The software that comes with was easy to load and the quality of the picture was perfect for the purpose I was using it for. Which was just to send some pictures to friends online. If your looking for a digital camera that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and efficient, the Canon PowerShot A5 is it.<br><br>
