            I first purchased the MVC-CD1000 for a vacation and have used it now for about six months for everything from hot air balloon rides to recording lab tests for my job.  The ease of use and the convenience of the CD-R media makes taking the pictures and sharing information or experiences easier than any other camera.  The most amazing pictures I took were from a plane window over Las Vegas at 22,000 feet using the 20X Precision Digital Zoom feature on 1-acre parcels with extreme clarity and high resolution.  I highly recommend that you buy the lens filters for outdoor use as the camera records everything with striking clarity.  The filters will allow you to remove the glare and enhance the viewing pleasure when you move to your desk or laptop computer.  The MPEG Movie HQ feature records movies in 2.1 gigapixels for up to a minute (I haven't tried any longer) and movies can be shot on the same CD-R as photos with only the flip of a switch.  The built-in microphone picks up the slightest noises from about 20 feet.  A 3" CD-R holds about 160 stills and about 100 combined stills and short MPEGS; you can find the 5-pack of the 3" media for anywhere from $14.95 to $21.95.  The viewing screen, 2.5" diagonal on back uses the same LCD technology as handheld TV sets.  I found my MVC-CD1000 for $900 online and that included the three filters, a case, an extra Li-ion battery, and an extra 5 pack of CD-R.  The units comes standard with video cables, one Li-ion battery, a 5-pack of CD-R and a strap for anywhere from $800-850.  One other side benefit is the conversation generated by the unit; although large like a professional camera, observers cannot help but to be intrigued by the capability.  This is the best electronics purchase I have made in a long time and after six months, I am not disappointed in the least.
