            We bought our 1999 Chevy Suburban October 1998.  We have owned a variety of cars in the last ten years.  We were a couple that had always believed that the pricier the vehicle the safer, nicer and better ride you would get.  In 1996 I drove my Mercedes in and drove off in a Jeep Grand Cherokee. It wasn't very long before I was unhappy with the vehicle.  I thought maybe I just wasn't the &quot;SUV&quot; type of person.  That opinion changed when we bought the Suburban.  Our decision to buy the Suburban came when we found out we were expecting our second child. I wanted a vehicle that could accommodate more people and also hold all the baby things one must bring when going away for a weekend.  At 28 years old I just couldn't bring myself to buying the &quot;I'm a mommy&quot; mini-van.  So, with my dad's strong opinion of his own suburban my husband and I purchased the biggest vehicle we have ever owned.  It took awhile to get used to driving something so big(my friends still can't believe I manage) but now I find myself whipping into parking spaces without even shuttering!  I think I completely fell in love with the Suburban the first time we went away for the weekend. We loaded up not only kids and luggage but almost everything the baby owned.  I couldn't believe how much space was available!  Sometimes I wondered how we ever made it without our Suburban.  Not only is it spacious but it ranks as one of the most comfortable vehicles we have owned.  We have yet to find one single thing wrong with it.  I think the only thing I can find to nit pick about is the price it cost to fill the gas tank.  We have added a performance exhaust system to ours and it seems to help out on the gas mileage but being such a big vehicle the gas goes quick.  In all fairness I would say I probably get worst gas mileage then most. I drive very short distances and all of it being city miles.  Other then that I would strongly recommend the Suburban to anyone considering an Suv.<br><br>
