            I bought a 2000 DX Hatchback in September as a used vehicle with only 11K on the odometer.  The car was flawless the entire time I owned it, but had to get rid of the car four months after buying it because I couldn't sell my other car.  That's another story...

No wonder Honda has a reputation for quality.  Not one minor problem with this car.  I put about 5000 miles on the car while I owned it.  I put an aftermarket intake on it, and it sounded great.  A bit slow however.  The transmission is geared for economy only (5-speed).  You can do over 70mph in 2nd gear!!!  Not exactly a great performer.  However, the car is very nimble, and is a great city vehicle.  

The build quality of this car was superb.  This car was assembled like a much more expensive vehicle.  However, there were some things that I didn't like. 

Very few options.  No tach, no power windows, locks etc.  Biggest annoyance was no cruise control.  My car didn't even have a tape player.  

If you are looking for a very reliable car that is built very good and gets great gas mileage, look no further than the Civic DX Hatchback.  You can get tons of stuff in it, and it won't take you to the cleaners price wise.  However, it isn't a rocket, nor a luxury car.
