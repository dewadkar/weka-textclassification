            A couple of months ago, we got one of the first 2003 GLS Turbos in Houston.  There's a new gray color for 2003, which looks phenomenal with the black leather interior.

<b>Checking the options list</b> - Volkswagon is trying to take their cars upmarket, and the Jetta is a great example of how you can turn a cheap car into a luxo-machine.  By checking the options boxes, we ended up with a GLS Turbo with heated leather seats, 5-speed Tiptronic transmission, sunroof, and power everything (except seats, and I'll come back to that.)  However, the car's sticker was almost $24,000, which is a lot of money for a car of this size.  You can get a loaded Civic for several thousands less, not to mention American cars.  But then again, you don't get all the amenities in those cars.  So you can probably stop reading here if you're the kind of person who worries about bang for the buck - go get yourself a Honda.  This car is for people who want goodies.

<b>The Turbo & Tiptronic combo</b> - VW offers four engines in the Jetta, but let me just say that the one you want is the turbo.  The diesel is underpowered, the basic four-cylinder is fine but not peppy, the turbo four is quite a little screamer, and the VR6 is very powerful but more money than it's worth.  (If you want to spend VR6 bucks, you should step up to the Passat for more space or step down to the GTI VR6 for more performance.)  When you couple the high-revving Turbo with the Tiptronic transmission, you get more fun than a barrel of monkeys.  The Tiptronic transmission allows you to slide it into "manual" mode, where you can bump the gearshift up and down and control the shifts manually.  However, the shifts don't occur as fast as I would like.  Instead, I find myself sticking with the automatic mode - if you keep on the gas pedal, the transmission will let the engine run right up to 6500rpm.  Oh, those beautiful noises!  On my highway trips, I've gotten between 30 and 35mpg.  In-town is significantly less.

<b>The interior ergonomics</b> - if you've owned a Jetta before, even a 90-95 one, you'll feel right at home.  Seems like nothing's changed from the gauge layout to the headlight switch.  Things just get better - now there's a real glove box, and if you get the upmarket GLS interior you'll even get an armrest with storage.  Now, for the bad: the cupholder in the dashboard is an absolute joke.  The AC vents blow directly on the cups, the cups block the stereo so you can't even see what track is playing let alone change the CD, the cupholder's arms feel flimsy, and spills pour directly into the transmission.  Grreat.  Do yourself a favor and get the armrest cupholder add-on from the VW web site for $15, so you can open the armrest and put your drinks inside.  You'll feel much better.

Seat adjustment is typically top-notch Volkswagon - anybody can get comfortable.  I've got a larger Olds Alero and the Jetta's seats actually go back farther than my Olds.  However, I can't fathom paying over $21k for a car and not getting power seats.  My girlfriend and I swap turns in the driver's seat all the time, and getting re-adjusted is a pain in the rear.  Come on, VW, at least make it an option and let us pay for power seats with two memories.  I'm willing to pay here.

<b>The ride</b> - this was the one surprise.  The Jetta should ride a little rough because it's got a short wheelbase, but we were quite surprised that it's rougher than we expected.  Road feel is excellent, if you're into that kind of thing (I am, she's not) but to most people, road feel translates into a bumpy ride.  VW has yet to master the ride engineering that the folks at BMW pull off.  My Olds is a better drive around town than the Jetta because it soaks up the bumps well, and my girlfriend was very disappointed that my $15k Olds feels more comfortable than her Jetta.  Ah, well.  If you want a boat-like ride, stick with American cars.  It's not bad enough that she gets carsick all the time, but it's happened once already during our ownership.

<b>Would I buy it again?</b> Absolutely.  The car is gorgeous, and when the Turbo whines up around 6000rpm with the wind blowing through the sunroof, it feels a world away from cheaper Toyotas or Hondas.  It's definitely the high point of small cars, the most luxurious car in its class that I've seen.  You pay for that luxury, but it's worth it.  For $21-$23k, you can get a bigger American car with less options, but nothing more fun and luxurious.
