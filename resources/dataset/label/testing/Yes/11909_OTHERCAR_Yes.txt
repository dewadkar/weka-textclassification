            Granted, I'm not a professional photographer, but I find myself playing around with taking pictures I might never have attempted with a traditional camera that I had to pay for developing. I got my Agfa ePhoto 780 about a year ago and have loved it! It brought picture taking back to our family.

The quality of the photos is obviously lower than some of the higher priced models, but for the money I was willing to spend, I am amazed at the great pictures. The 780, coupled with my Epson 700 Photo printer and the right paper, delivers fabulous pictures in no time at all. And since I print them on the printer, I am free to share them with everyone!

On the downside, I hate the software that comes with the camera. I installed it at first but quickly ditched it. I use Paint Shop Pro to edit my pics and ActiveShare to download them from the camera and store them. The serial connection to the camera was easy to install (just plug it in!) and the download time is acceptable, if not extremely quick.

The camera came standard with a 2mb SmartMedia card. I quickly found that this was far from adequate. I upgraded to an 8mb card and all is well now. And the battery consumption...at first was rather daunting, needing new batteries nearly every 10 pictures. But I soon discovered Energizer Lithium batteries and my troubles were solved.  I now take, download, view, play with, etc. about 150-175 pictures before I have to change batteries.

Overall, the camera is easy to use right out of the box, fun to play with, and delivers super pictures!
