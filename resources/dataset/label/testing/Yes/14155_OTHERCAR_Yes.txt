            I wanted a beginner, inexpensive digital camera. I bought a Finepix 1300. I love it. The batteries last a long time. (but get rechargeables, they are a good investment!)
This is a 1.3 megapixel camera, so you are not going to be able to print huge enlargements. Still, I have printed out 5x7's that are gorgeous. I use it mainly for posting on the net and to email to family/friends.  The software is easy and the pictures download very quickly! This camera is very light. I've used digitals that are very heavy. I travel a lot and don't want to lug anymore than I have to.
