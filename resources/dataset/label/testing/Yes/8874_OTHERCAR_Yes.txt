            I bought this little 1991 Subaru Justy to take some of the mileage off of my old 1973 Ford pickup that I dearly love. I named my little Subaru "Justy".

Justy is a little green car that I bought for $1,400.00 from a local dealer. At first I didn't like being in Justy because I am a die-hard old Ford fan, but the more I drove this car the better I liked it, it takes curves very well and the gas mileage is wonderful. I went 373 miles on $11.00 worth of gas and at $1.39 a gallon that is not a lot of gas. My Ford gets about 50-75 miles on $11.00 if I am careful. 

 Considering the size of the the Subaru Justy, it has alot of seating room. The seats could be more comfortable but for an economy car their not bad. The trunk space is small but holds my groceries.

  The most important factors to me about the Subaru Justy is the four wheeled drive and the fact that it is a five speed transmission. In the location where we live a four wheeled drive is important, the weather can turn bad very quickly because of the elevation and trees shading the roads. The fact the this car is a straight was a big plus to the car, this increases the power in an older car in performance, gas mileage and maintence costs. A straight drive transmission is more inexpesive to replace or repair than an automatic transmission. Of all of the vehicles my husband own all 4 of them are straight transmissions and two are four wheeled drives and 2 are Subaru's. 

  The four-wheeled drive system in my Justy works very good though the car could be higher off the ground. I love to go four-wheeling but not in this one.

 All in all considering the variety of conditions this car is good for this is a great car. I also trust the Subaru name that is a big plus, too. My husband and I have owned this makes 5 Subaru's and have been pleased with their performance. 

  I would recommend any car in the Subaru line as long as you steer clear of the Turbo's.
