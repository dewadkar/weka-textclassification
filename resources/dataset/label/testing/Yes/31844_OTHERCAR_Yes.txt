            I've been a Volkswagen owner for over 35 years, having purchased my first Volkswagen in Germany in 1964.  This was a Variant, which lasted a long time,  in fact there are still some on the road today.  This year I purchased a new 2000 Volkswagen, station wagon, 6 cylinder with 4 motion.  All I can say is &quot;WOW&quot;.  This is undoubtedly the best Volkswagen ever built at the Wolfsburg, Germany factory.

It's stylish, it's fast and has all amenities of a Mercedes which costs about twice as much.  The six cylinder engine is powerful, the Porsche transmission is one of the smoothest in the world, the four wheel drive makes for better handling and safer turning, especially in inclement weather. 

The car is luxurious, with leather seating surfaces, hand polished accents and every piece seems like it has been hand detailed.  

Seating is comfortable and the highly adjustable seats fight fatigue.  The Volkswagen is a small car with a roomy interior which makes for easy parking in small garages and compact parking spaces. 

Last but not least is the safety features that have been built into this car. It has a double firewall, which would force the engine, on impact in a collision, to drop down rather than back through the drivers compartment.  The side air bags are usually found on more expensive vehicles. 

This is a very fun car to drive, quick response, easy handling and a car that anyone would enjoy driving.<br><br>
