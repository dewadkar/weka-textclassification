            I bought the Fuji 1400 having read reviews on all the cameras around 1 megapixel (in fact that's how I discovered epinions) and am very impressed.

My needs were a reasonably cheap digital camera to be used largely for web work with the odd print now and again.

One of the big attractions with this camera over others at its price was the 3x Optical zoom - don't bother with digital zooms, you're better off cropping in PhotoShop.

The camera is small, light and compact, and whilst I'm a little old fashioned in prefering camera to have nice solid metal bodies the construction seems fairly robust.

The controls are a little small for a large-handed person like myself but are well placed and intuitative to use. I like the sliding lens cover, plus the fact that it doesn't act as the on/off control.

The smartmedia slot is easy to use, with an adequate door flap. Personally I think 4mb is a little mean, allowing only half a dozen photos at maximum quality, but it will hold a fair few low resolution shots for web work. At least at this price an additional card won't leave your pockets too hurt.

The LCD is clear - not the best I've seen but adequate.

Battery life is amongst the best I've seen for a digicam, and batteries are easily replaced.

The plastic tripod mount is a bit of a let down, but to be fair how often do compact camera users use a tripod?

The USB connection makes uploading pictures a doddle, almost instantaneous, you just get a temporary drive added to Windows Explorer. I haven't used the other supplied software as I already have PhotoShop LE but it's a fairly good bundle.

Image quality is quite good for this price band. 6x4 prints are indistinguishable from those taken on a 35mm compact and 7x5's are incredibly close. In good light you might get away with a reasonably good 9x6 at maximum quality settings. Colour accuracy is pretty good, perhaps a touch bright but nothing major.

Viewfinder accuracy isn't wonderful - use the LCD for close ups and important shots.

On the downside this is a compact camera and suffers the same problem most compact cameras suffer from - red eye. In some cases the 1400 is a particularly bad offender, but at least with digital it is easy to remedy before printing. To be fair the flash is powerful enough for most uses.

Outside shots are better than indoor and good lighting improves them no end but don't expect anything better than an equivalantly specified 35mm compact. If you want high quality digital images at this price you'd be better off buying a secondhand SLR and a half decent scanner, but as a replacement for a 35mm compact it's a very good buy.
