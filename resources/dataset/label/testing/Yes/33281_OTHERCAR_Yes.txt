            I purchased my used BMW last Feb and when I say used, I mean used.  It's an '85 and wouldn't you know...it runs like a DREAM!

I adore my car and it's not just because it comes with that nifty little BMW icon on the hood, though that helps! I love it because it is by far, the BEST vehicle I've ever owned.  The seats are so comfortable you could put on a pair of your fuzziest slippers and your favorite rag mag and kick back for a couple of hours.

The drive is smooth, the steering handles so easily, the suspension...feels like you're driving on a cloud!  The interior is very roomy both in the front and the back.

The only downside is the mileage is not the best but I think this has more to do with the age of the vehicle.

I'd like to move up to a new BMW but the mechanics tell me to hold on this one, I might very well be driving it for a long time to come.
