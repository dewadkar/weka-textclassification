            I am in the process of buying a car, and I really like the CRV.  Although the size might be intimidating for people who are not used to SUV's, the mirrors are large enough to have a good view of the street, making it easy to estimate distances.  I was attracted to the 1997 CRV because a friend has one, and I want something that will do well in the snow, has enough room to fit people and luggage, and gets decent gas mileage for a vehicle of its size.

For all these requirements, the CRV is an excellent vehicle, and I was surprised to find how comfortable the seats were and how much I liked the placement of the controls.  The CRV makes decent sharp turns as compared to  the RAV4, and the ones I have seen are equipped with anti-locks and all wheel drive.  After a few minutes, I was able to adjust to how different the road looked from that high up, and really enjoyed the feel of the CRV.

As I drive this car more, I also appreciate the small details more.  I like the fact that the door locks are set up to prevent you from locking the keys in the car, the lights beep loudly when they are left on and the driver's side door is open, the gas tank and hatch releases are well placed, and there is an armrest on the front seats.  These things that I initially didn't even look for have proved themselves time and again by stopping me from killing my battery or having to wait for and pay a locksmith at an inconvenient time.


The only time I did not enjoy the feel of the CRV was attempting to go up a hill, as I had to push the pedal harder than on any other car.  Even then, the CRV strained to make it.  I thought this might be an issue when going onto the highway, but the acceleration lanes proved long enough for me to merge.  Still, this is no racing vehicle, and I'm sure the pickup is less when the CRV is packed.

In spite of this, I am currently comparing prices of CRVs in my area, and it is my first choice when it comes to vehicles of this size.  The question is whether it is worth 1,500 dollars more than the 1997 RAV4.  My recommendation would be to test drive them both, because that is almost to close a call to make.

Addendum: I purchased this vehicle, and have changed the stats accordingly.  So far it has been wonderful, and the lack of power has not been a huge problem.  I am very happy with my decision.
