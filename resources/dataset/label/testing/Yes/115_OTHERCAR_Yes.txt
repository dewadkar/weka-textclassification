            I have to say that this is one of the best investments I have made lately! I purchased this camera for business purposes. I have a Gift Basket business, and I wanted to have the ability to make color brochures and flyers that will show detail. And be able to take ONE picture of a basket design, and get it right. Unlike the standard 35mm, I had to take several pictures, then spend money for the developing to find out that I did not get one good shot!
I did not have a lot of money to spend on a camera, so this one was a great choice. For pictures up to 5x7, it takes photos that are just perfect, larger pictures come out good too, they loose some detail and quality. This camera is very easy to use, and the software that comes with, is also great!
I have also used this camera for my personal use, and now never leave the house without it! I get shots that I would NEVER have gotten before b/c I had no film.
The only drawback to this camera I can see is the batteries need to be changed frequently.
This camera is perfect for personal and business use, people who want a relatively inexpensive digital camera that will take good quality photos. I would also recommend this camera to first timers, or people who want to upgrade to a mega pixel.
