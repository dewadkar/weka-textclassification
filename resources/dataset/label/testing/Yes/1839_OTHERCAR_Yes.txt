            I did not buy my 1997 Pontiac Grand Am (automatic) for myself; it came as a gift.  But a few years later, I know I would definitely considering buying one for myself in the future.

<b>General Performance of the Car</b>

My Grand Am now has about 29,000 miles on it in 3 years, so it gets moderate use.  About two-thirds of these miles are city driving.  During this time, I have had no repair or maintenance needs outside of regular oil changes and replacing my front tires, which wore down far too early.  I imagine, however, that these tires were duds, and although they came with the car, I don't blame it on Pontiac.  (I will update my opinion if my new tires wear thin as well!)  [Update 6/2001: After 4 years and nearly 40,000 miles, my Grand Am has still required no un-scheduled maintenance.  It continues to serve me well.]

The Grand Am upgraded to a V6 engine is quite powerful, with what I find to be excellent acceleration and braking speeds.  I'm far from a car expert, but for my needs, the Grand Am has been the best car I've driven in these respects.  The car also handles well, although it certainly doesn't turn on a dime.

Fuel efficiency is fine; I'm afraid that I am a bad car owner and have not measured it lately, but my sense is that it is about average--not as good as the amazing Honda Civic or Accord, and not nearly as bad as some others you could find.

The speakers in this car are also worthy of note.  Friends with a much better knowledge of speakers than I have have been surprised that I did not upgrade them.  In other words, the basic speakers in this car are of much better quality than in many other cars.

<b>What I like best about the Grand Am</b>

In short, the car has performed well for me, with no problems.  But what I think stands out most to me, in comparison to other cars, is the little things that make the Grand Am fun to live with.  They might seem silly at first, but you'd be amazed at how annoying little things like this can be if it's not quite right.

First, the sunglasses holder: there's a slot for sunglasses on the roof, right above the rearview mirror.  It's perfectly placed--the glasses are always right in reach but keep out of the way.

And then there's the cup holders--they are right in the central column, not the dangling kind that are so unstable (as, for example, in Saturns).  But further, they are the perfect size!  They fit cans, 20-oz bottles, and McDonald's-type cups all equally well.  Believe me, this is a rarity.  Little things like this really make a difference.

<b>What I'm not crazy about in the Grand Am</b>

There are also a couple of little things that aren't as great.  For one thing, I do not like the way Pontiac designed the climate control features.  When selecting among air types (low or high air conditioning, inside or outside air, head or feet or both, etc.), you have only one dial, which you must usually click through four or five choices before you reach the right one.  This is much less convenient than, say, the Honda Accord, where there are on/off push buttons for these features.  I am also concerned about the wear and tear that might come from this feature.  When I click through the choices, I can hear puffs of air as I switch modes, which makes me think that this mechanism is a bit crude.  But then again, I don't know much about cars--that's just my feeling.  And as I said, it's simply not as convenient to maneuver as you are driving.

My second pet peeve is a very minor one--the front license plate is mounted off-center.  I suppose that because the front of the car comes to a peak, they felt that mounting the license plate there would be too much, or not sturdy, or something.  Whatever the reason, it simply looks weird to those of us who are symmetry-minded.

<b>Conclusions</b>

In short, my Grand Am has served me well with moderate use over three years, and has several smaller features that I particularly enjoy, making this car one I would recommend to others.  Best of all, it is not a particularly pricey car, so you can get good reliability and features without breaking the bank.
