            We own a 1998 Saturn LS, and are leasing a Mercury Sable.  When we turn the Sable in, in August, we are leasing another Saturn.

We have not had any problems with the Saturn, except for the keypad for the alarm not working.  Saturn came to where my car was with a new battery for the keypad and made sure I was off and on my way before they left.  
The only complaint I have about the car is the back seat is cramped and you sit up at an angle (luckily I don't have to set back there - my kids do and they don't mind).  The trunk is very roomy and you can easily put odd sized boxes in the trunk - there is no lip on the trunk, the trunk hood is &quot;L&quot; shaped so the lip is in the hood.  We have a factory installed CD Player in our car and there have not been any problems with that - it plays smoothly, even when you hit bumps.  The window controls are in the center console and take a bit of getting used to, but after opening and closing them a few times it's not a problem.  This car has daytime running lights (which give you a discount on your auto insurance) and it has a factor installed alarm (another discount) - Make sure you tell your insurance company about these features.  We are getting about 26 MPG locally and about 35 on the highway (another important feature with todays gas prices).

We bring our car in regularly (every 3 months) for an oil change and whatever the scheduled maintenance is on the car at the time (rotate tires, 3,000 mile checkup, etc.).The service department is wonderful and is the main reason for me wanting another Saturn. (Plus they wash your car each time you bring it in for service.)  I have had to deal with service departments for other car dealerships and Saturn is the only one where I have felt comfortable.

They are truly a different kind of car and a different kind of people.  I have not met one unpleasant employee at Saturn whether it be in service, sales, or just speaking to the Saturn Receptionist on the phone.  

I highly recommend them - my next car is the Saturn Stationwagon.<br><br>
