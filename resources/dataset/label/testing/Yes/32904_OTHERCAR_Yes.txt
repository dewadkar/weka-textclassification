            Well, we finally did it.  My husband and I finally bought a digital camera.  He did lots of research on digital cameras, starting sure of what he wanted and ending up with something totally different.  The first thing we loved about this camera was the size,  we were impressed with how small and lightweight this camera was.  No more arguing who would lug the camera around, "you carry it,your the one who wanted the pictures".  It easily fits inside the average fanny pack or sometimes we hang off the fanny pack zipper in a sunglass case(yes it fits).  Right out of the box, once the battery was charged, we were able to pretty much figure out how to use it, we both hate to read directions, but this was really simple.  We bought a Sandisk reader right away so that we didn't have to use the camera battery to down load picture to our computer.  The camera came with some great software for making scrapbooks or photos with matting.  It has some great choices of backgrounds frames and matting.  Its easy to use ,pick your photo choices and your frame and matting choices and the software does the rest. Color and clarity have been great. Both the viewfinder and LCD are easy to use.  One of the thing we wanted was a larger compact flash card and we bought one right away, we got the 64MG card and are able to take up to 700 pictures or 3 minutes of video.  The video is great for those special birthday or holiday e-mail cards(the grandparents will love them. The batter is OK, doesn't last as long as they say.  But is easy to keep charge up and camera comes with a recharger.  When we decided on this camera we found it hard to find one, they came out only the beginning of this month, but we found a lot on line.
