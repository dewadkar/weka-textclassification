            My parents bought their 1996 Dodge Intrepid almost by accident four years ago.  My family has had a long history with automobiles, and this one will be sure to make it into the scrapbook.  It all started when we began looking for a vehicle to replace the Dodge Ram 1500 Conversion Van that my Mom had been driving for about 2 years. It had just gotten too big, and the �coolness� of having a conversion van had finally worn off.  Since the van was the third Dodge car we owned (previous models included a 1987 Caravan and 1992 Shadow), naturally we went first to our local Dodge dealer with whom we had a good relationship.  

Initially, because my parents were taking such a big hit on selling their van early (almost four years before it was to be paid off), we looked at the Dodge Stratus, which if I recall correctly, was starting out at about $15,000 back then. However, in order to equip the Stratus the way my parents wanted it (V6, A/C, etc.), we had to move up to the ES trim of the car and even then a few options had to be added.  By that point, the price of the car was pushing $20,000, and my parents were getting quite discouraged.

Enter Dodge Intrepid. Sitting across the showroom from the Stratus was a lone Dodge Intrepid, with a window sticker somewhere around $18,500 with just about everything my parents wanted, and more�more space, more size, more car for the money. With all the options tacked on (Platinum Clearcoat Metallic finish, front bucket seats, and others), tax, destination, title, etc., the price came out to be around $20,000, a steal when compared to the Stratus. My parent�s couldn�t pass it up, and myself being the resident car expert in the family, urged them not too. I was sure the Intrepid would serve us well.

I was right. Four years later, the Intrepid is still humming along.  With less than 30,000 miles on it, it is almost like new even if the interior has taken quite a beating from us &quot;�kids�.  The V6 still purrs like a newborn kitten, and has all the pep and spunk it had the day it came out of the dealer�s lot. The handling on the Intrepid is good for such a large car (it, of course, pales in comparison to my VW Jetta) and it corners reasonably well. 

As far as exterior design goes, I love the Intrepid�s style. I have always thought of it as a �wedge�-shaped car, and that�s what it is. It looks fast just sitting there. It�s not too bland, like the cars from GM at the time, or overly stylish, like some Ford models (when will they learn that the oval is not the best shape in the world?). 

Inside, I find the instruments to be well laid out. The black-on-white gauges are extremely easy to read, and all controls are clearly marked and easily reached by the driver.  Because the model year was a transitional time for Chrysler on the whole, some of the interior looks like it came out of a K-car while the rest looks brand new. This clash of old and new on the inside lends itself to an inconsistent look at times, although nothing that can�t be gotten used to. The seats are certainly mid-nineties Chrysler seats�a little too cushy for my tastes but still well suited for short jaunts as well as long road trips.

A few things that I find lacking in the 1996 Intrepid: lack of a rear seat pass-through to the trunk; a poorly designed passenger-side airbag cover that refuses to remain flush with the dashboard; and sub-par interior plastics.

We haven�t had many major mechanical problems with the Intrepid other than routine maintenance. Perhaps the most serious was a malfunction of the car�s dealer-installed Mopar security system. This problem caused the battery to drain and left the alarm unable to be turned off. It resulted in a tow and a trip to the dealer, and was not covered under warranty.

Overall, I must say that the Intrepid was a good car at the time. It was the right price at the right place, and has served my family well over the past four years. Even so, my mother is tired of having such a large car and is looking to purchase a VW Passat or Audi A4 2.8 in the near future. Look for a review of one of those two vehicles in the coming months.<br><br>
