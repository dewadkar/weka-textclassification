            The DaimlerChrysler vans have been best sellers since they were introduced for 3 reasons: models (many configurations availible from each brand- dodge, chrysler, and plymouth), options (you can go from a $17,000 four-banger short wheels base to a $33,000 leather lined V6 Long wheel base), and versatility (carry 7 people or remove all seats and carry 2 people and cargo).

   My parents bought a 1998 Plymouth Voyager short wheel base V6 base model for $21,200, not including taxes and such in mid August 1998.  They wanted a minivan because they are flea market addicts and the fact that their 1984 Olds Cutlass Ciera was on its last leg.

   I helped them look through all of the "big 3"'s minivans.  We looked at the Ford Windstar, but it was too big for them and they needed that 4th door.  We looked at the Chevrolet Venture and Olds Silhouette, but neither were offering any good deals.  We then went over to dodge to look at Caravans, but the 2 area Dodge dealer's were sold out of all 1998 models, and only long wheel bases were in as 1999 models. 

   We then went to a Plymouth dealer.  tHey wewre easy to deal with and talk to and treated my 70 year old parents with respect.  They had plenty of left over 1998 Voyagers in every form.  My grandmother wanted a red van, so after seeing a red 1998 Short Wheelbase 3.0 litre, they decided to take it on a test drive.  They liked it, and settled on it.  They bought it that day and picked it up the next.

  It had a small amount of options, but more than enough luxury for a couple of their age.  It had the optional roof rack, cassette am/fm stereo, A/C, V6, and 4th door.
