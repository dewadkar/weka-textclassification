            I saved for a truck for many years.  When I went to buy one I shopped extensively.  I do not think you can get a more powerful better looking truck for the money.

I have a 1999 F-150 supercab stepside with the off-road package.  The truck has a 5.4l V-8 which has more power than you could possibly use during normal driving.  The off road suspension is a little tough but if you go off of the beaten path it is well worth it.

The interior is well designed and all controls are within reach of the driver.  The only gripe I have is with the air conditioner controls.  The only way to get recirc is with max AC.  I wish there was a separate recirc button so you could recirc in any mode.

The looks of the truck are outstanding.  The Toyota Tundra did all but completely model itself after the F-150.  The look is sleek and professional.  The seats are comfortable for a long drive, and the back seat is roomy.  The back of the back seat is very straight and can be uncomfortable for tall adults.

The 17in tires that come with the off-road package are perfect.  They look great and give good traction.  Now that the price of 17in tires have come down in price they are also a great deal.

My truck has the Mark III conversion package.  While it looks nice, the parts (window louvers and step boards) are plastic and rattle.  My truck has a power slider for the rear window.  I recommend this for anyone with a sliding rear window it is so convenient and at only $150.00 from Mark III its a great deal.

Number one feature is the ability to turn off the passenger side airbag. This makes it safe for both children and senior adults.

Overall I highly recommend this truck and I am very pleased with mine.<br><br>
