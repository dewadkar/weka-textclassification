            I got this camera for $150 via online auction. I consider it a great buy for the price. The 1024 X 768 picture resolution fits very well into my needs. I get satisfactory color printouts off of my Epson printer and the size does not take all day to upload on the internet, or e-mail to friends and family.

I like the 'mini movie' feature, though I quickly learned that the 4MB SmartMeda Card that came with the camera was insufficient for this purpose. I bought a 16 MB card and am happy.

The Sequential mode I have found more useful than I originally thought. By shooting 15 shots .1 second apart in a situation where motion is involved, I have found that I get a 'good' shot every time. I review the frames and delete 14 of the 15, leaving one 'best shot' of the sequence.

The macro mode has proven invaluable for taking pictures of documents. The camera becomes kind of a 'mini portable photo copier', though a lesser quality one for sure. Still it has served a definite purpose for me that I find useful.

The only real negative I have with this camera is the short battery life. If freshly charged, I can get 40-45 minutes off a pair of batteries, without using the LCD screen. I've gotten around this by carrying 8 batteries in my camera pouch. Even so, I constantly find myself in a 'battery shortage' mode.

The various image size settings, zoom in or out, increase or decrease light, turn on or off flash capabilities of this camera gives me plenty of flexibility, and the ability to review the picture immediately and adjust is without a doubt the main advantage of a digital camera. 

Overall, the ease of use, the wide range of features and tools and the picture quality more than offset the relatively short battery life from my standpoint. I like the camera and use it a lot more than I ever used my 35 mm SLR.
