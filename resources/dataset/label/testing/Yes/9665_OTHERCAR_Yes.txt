            I bought this vehicle back in May of 98.  I originally bought it because it was red, my favorite car color.  I didn't really care for the way it looked thought it was a little odd shaped.  I wanted a small car with good gas mileage and that's exactly what I got.  I absolutely love this car.  

It gets awesome gas mileage not sure how much didn't actually keep track but I know it did, because I do a lot of driving and only filled it up a couple times a month.  

This car has an unbelievable amount of room for a small car.  My hubby is pretty tall, over 6' and he never had a problem riding in or driving.  Even the back seat was very roomy.  The back doors had the child lock feature which I loved.  I have a very &quot;spirited&quot; 5 year old and just didn't trust here sometimes.  

The front panel was very accessible.  This is just an all around great little car.  <br><br>
