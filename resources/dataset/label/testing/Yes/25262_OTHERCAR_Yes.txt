            All to often we hear about the JD Powers new car evaluations of how an automobile is built. This is an interesting objective, as most things, when new, tend to fit tightly and have relatively few problems. However, the real measure of any vehicle is how well it takes mileage. And, I don�t mean just a couple of thousand, but 40, 50, 60,000 miles or more. That�s when you find out whether the vehicle you bought is any good. 

In 1993, Nissan introduced the Altima. They decided to increase the brand presence by selling, en masse, to car rental firms. This turned to be a blessing and a curse. The benefit was they sold more cars. However, the cost was even more significant � with so many cars in rental fleets around the country, it drove the trade-in/resale value down. This resulted in marginalizing the cars real value. This is unfortunate, because the Altima is a truly spectacular car.

All right, maybe spectacular is an overstatement, but let me frame the argument. I bought my Altima in 1995 with 10 miles on the odometer. As of this date, it�s been driven 270,000+ rough miles (rough, in that I drive my cars very hard and very fast). So what do I have after this much driving? An Altima that will cruise all day at 90+ miles/hour, will get 28-31 miles/gallon (at that speed), hasn�t had any major equipment/component failures and continues to clean up and look really descent after a wash. And did I also mention that it doesn�t burn an ounce of oil?

I tend to hammer my cars, driving them hard, fast and with complete disregard. Most of my cars haven�t been able to handle this abuse; except the one�s that have a 3-Pointed star on the hood. The Altima has been adroit and competent in its driving characteristics. I bought the SE and found a car that loves to go. At 90 MPH the car just hums along, with little wind noise and a sense that you�ve found it�s grove. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is rated at150 hp and seems to be on tap whenever you need it. Combine that with some incredible durability and you end up with a really �sweet� ride!

Does the Altima have any weaknesses? Sure. It�s not loaded with the neatest upgrades on the market and the A/C compressor engages anytime you place the selector on defrost and the temperature below warm. But this turns out to be mixed blessing, because you may not feel you want the compressor to kick in, sapping much need horsepower, but you get a return of increase fuel economy (someone explain that to me?!).

Because of my experience with the '95, my son bought a new Altima SE this year. He's very happy with the car and feels it will equal the experience I've had with mine. 

The Altima is a comfortable, fast, car that actually has room in the back for people larger than your poodle and it will take the abuse normal driving will heap upon it. If you don�t have a prodigious amount of money in your bank account, and still want descent, respectable, pocket-rocket transportation, you should seriously look at this vehicle!
