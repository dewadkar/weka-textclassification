            The DeLorean DMC-12 is a car that screams its uniqueness to the world. Those who like them will praise the cars styling, price, individuality, and, surprisingly, economy. Driving the DeLorean (or DMC-12, to give it its true model name) is a thrill. It boasts a relaxed, comfortable driving position, typical of sports coupes, good handling, comfortable controls, and enough power to make driving a potentially adrenaline-pumping experience. I would recommend purchasing one to any person who has already determined that they have the finances to afford one. However, I would not recommend this vehicle to young, inexperienced drivers, or anyone who is exceptionally tall.<br><br>
