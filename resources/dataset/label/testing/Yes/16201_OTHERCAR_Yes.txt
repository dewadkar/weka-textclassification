            I love this minivan! Now, I have been a Toyota owner for more than 10 years and have always been impressed with their products but I spend alot of time researching a new car when the time comes to buy. I test drove all the minivans on the market before I bought the Sienna and Sienna had it all. The price was comparable to many vans on the market and quite a few extras were included. It has a very comfortable ride, especially for long distance trips. The only thing I can think of that I don't Like about the car is that the back seat doesn't fold down the way the Honda does. I'd like better gas mileage too, but they all are like that. <br><br>
