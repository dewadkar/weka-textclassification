            I've always liked HP products not only because of the price but because they seem to last a little longer than your usual product.  Plus they are compatible with almost every computer system out there.

I bought my HP 318 Digital Camera last year at a local Target.  It was on sale for $199.99.  I had been checking out other digital cameras but this one seemed to be the best deal with more options like 2X digital zoom, 3 different settings for pictures (normal quality, medium quality, and great quality which uses more of your photo space), and the options of using regular batteries.  I really didn't want to purchase a camera that you had to buy special batteries for.  Not only are they expensive ($9.99 and up) but they use the power up way too fast.  I'd rather use rechargables or just buy the batteries on an "as need" basis.  On an average night the HP digital camera I have will use 4 AA's in about a two hour time span.  

This camera is a decent camera if you are looking for something that you don't want to spend a lot of money on and will give you good photos.  This camera is compatible with pc's and supplies you with the software to install on your system for transferring your photos.  The cable they supply you with will fit right into your port on the front of the computer.  As soon as you plug it in and turn on your camera your computer will automatically detect the camera is trying to transfer images and it will then pop up a screen asking you where you want to transfer them to.  I thought the auto-detect tool was kinda neat.  Once you transfer them onto your pc you can delete them from the camera giving you extra space again.  You can also stick them back in your camera if you want to as well which is another thing I thought was really cool.  

Another thing with this camera is that it's very lightweight.  It won't feel like you have this heavy piece of equipment on your shoulder or on your wrist which makes it that much easier to take along to a concert or show.  I bought a small camera bag for it and it looks like a small purse, it's very convenient.

The camera itself is reliable.  I've taken so many photos with it I can't believe it.  It has a timer on it that give you up to 10 seconds, it has double zoom, it also has some pretty cool features you can turn on and off like the flash and the red eye reduction, it's also got an after zoom option so you can see the photo up closer than you actually took it.
  
One of the best things about me buying a digital camera was so that I didn't have to buy film anymore.  I figured I use half my photos to send to my family through the computer anyways so why not buy a digital???  This camera stores easily 100+ photos on the normal option.  You can take photos at three different resolutions: Normal, Medium, and best quality.  The best quality option will only let you take 6-7 photos because it takes up a lot of memory.  If you buy a memory card then you'd be able to take a lot more photos.  I believe the memory cards for this particular camera cost around 40$.

Overall this is a good camera if you don't want to spend a lot of money.  The photo quality is decent and it is very reliable.  I would recommend it.
