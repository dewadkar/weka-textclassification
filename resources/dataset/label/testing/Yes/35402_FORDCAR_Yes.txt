            This is the second Ford Ranger I have owned.  The first Ranger was a 4 cylinder, 2 WD XLT long bed.  I loved that truck, but didn't have as much power as I needed at times.  This Ranger is much more powerful as it has the same engine as the Explorer.  In fact, the Explorer is built on the Ranger chassis.  This truck is sporty yet versatile in that it has plenty of power and a bed large enough to accomplish any job I have needed it for.  It has been very reliable and functional as evidenced in the record-breaking winter (126 inches!) I spent with it in Connecticut.  I would highly recommend this model to my friends.  The only options I would add would be a CD changer and an automatic transmission.  It is built FORD TOUGH!!<br><br>
