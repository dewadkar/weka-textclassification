            In my opinion, it's a testament to Honda's engineering prowess that my Prelude just hit 200,000 miles and still runs basically flawless. This was my first car, and, having owned it for almost 3 years now, I've only had to make 2 unexpected repairs on it- the front brakes needed new pads, and a blown fuse (hazard light/rear defrost module).

This car is very fun to drive, even more so than most new cars. You can toss it around curves easily and, while it's acceleration is fairly modest in sports car terms, the engine sounds very sporty and makes the car seem faster than it actually is. All of my friends, upon driving my car, remark that it's the easiest-to-drive car they've ever driven. Thus, it's great as a first-car. 

Other high points include: The seats are very comfortable, even if they are quite small; on my car, there are even adjustable lumbar supports you can use to make them more comfortable. This car is pretty quiet at cruising speeds; a lot of my friends also have sports cars, and, in comparison, my Prelude is quieter at highway speeds and in normal acceleration than theirs. Also, the design of this car is simply beautiful; it doesn't look like an out-dated trend (like old toyotas tend to), but it has a very classic, simple beauty to it. The dashboard is cleanly and simply laid out and the controls are about as intuitive as they come.

Now, a few quibbles with this otherwise wonderful car: The engine vibrates a _lot_, especially with the air conditioner on; this may be due to the age/wear of my car, or it may not, I couldn't really say for sure. The trunk is also rather small (in true sports car fashion); when I got this car, I didn't know that I'd be lugging around huge art projects for college, and so I didn't really think that I'd need a larger trunk, however, the rear seat also folds down and creates more space. Also, this is not the car for drivers over about 6'2&quot; or so; I'm 6'2&quot; and my head comes within 1/2&quot; of the roof and my knees come close to touching the steering wheel. And another thing- the fuel economy drops dramatically with the air conditioner on.

Overall, though, this is a great car! I'd recommend it especially for buyers who don't have a whole lot of cash to spend on a car, but need reliable transportation with a liberal dose of fun to it.<br><br>
