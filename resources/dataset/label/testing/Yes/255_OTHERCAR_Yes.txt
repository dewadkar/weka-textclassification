            Hello There,

   The Canon G1.  An all around great professional feeling camera.  The design is very tasteful as in it looks like a typical camera.  But packed inside isn't an ordinary film camera, it's one of the top of the line digital cameras.  Definitely stands out from the rest, and here's why.

   The Canon G1 has lots of power behind the little camera.  It's <b>3.34MegaPixels</b> produces such great quality that you can get blown up pictures sizes of 20"x30" and 20"x24" without any loss of quality.  The <b>3x Optical Zoom</b> is one of the big features that helps the camera stand out from the crowd.  It really helps getting those shots that you want to be just a little closer to.  But if that isn't close enough you can set your camera to either a <b>2x or 4x digital zoom</b> which will be multiplied by your optical.  So for example, if you had your camera optically zoomed at 3x and was digitally at 4x you get a 12x zoom.  Also remember though, the digital zoom is a blown up image that is produced by a very complicated algorithm.  So there is some loss in quality to have the benefit of the added on zoom.  <b>Movie Mode</b> on this camera is very good.  It's in AVI format and also can capture <b>sound</b> too!  No silent movie from this camera.
<b>USB</b> is a huge plus, only about half of all digital cameras come with USB built in.  At this size of pictures you are very thankful for it.  There is absolutely tons of features on this camera.  Has most the professional features like <b>Manual Focus and Manual Exposure up to 8 seconds or 1/1000 of a second!</b> The camera comes with a <b>wireless remote control</b> and is great for tripping the camera without touching it at all.  No more macro pictures with that small bit of movement from pressing the shutter button.  It has Optical Zoom in and out and some other features on the remote.  It is very small so if you was taking a picture of yourself you could easily hide it in your hand.  The camera also features and comes with a <b>lithium rechargeable battery and charger</b>.  When your batteries run out just plug it in and the camera will charge itself.  You can also get an accessory that you can plug it into your car adapter.  The <b>included 16 meg compact flash card</b> is reasonable but could easily use a 32 meg card.  But that seem that way with all digital cameras.  This camera can also take type II memory cards which range up to 192megs and also can use <b>MicroDrives</b> which come in 340megs and 1gig!  Wow!  This camera is ready for today and for tomorrows technology.  Bigger memory capability, interchangeable lenses and much much more.
