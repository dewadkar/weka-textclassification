            Do I keep my paid off 3000GT sports car that my family totally outgrew or start all over with a bigger vehicle and a bigger car payment? That was the question, until I test drove the Toyota 4Runner. I narrowed it down to  the jeep and the 4Runner. I liked all the extra features the Toyota had to offer. We now have room for backpacks, lunch pals, car seat and portable chairs for Saturday soccer games. Boy, am I in heaven. I love to drive my 4Runner. I like sitting up high above other cars and I feel much safer on the road. If you like sports cars, but need more room, then this is the car (SUV) 4 you.<br><br>
