            The Buick Century is a perfect car for the average size family. It's comfort and safety features make it a pleasure to drive. I leased a 1998 Buick Century and will turn it in on another Buick in the future I'm sure. The only thing that could be better is the paint quality. The color is fine but is easily marred by those who would open their doors and hit your car. Therefore on the darker colors the scratches show up glaringly. When I decided on a Buick, I had only the Oldsmobile to compare the different features and handling on the road. I found the Buick to be smoother and a softer ride compared to the Oldsmobile and could appeal to the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme fans easily.
