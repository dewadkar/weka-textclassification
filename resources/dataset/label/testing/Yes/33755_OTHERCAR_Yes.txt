            The Car

If there�s such a thing as an affordable car with presence and charisma, it is the 156.  Backed by the European Car of The Year 1998 award and numerous rave reviews, Alfa Romeo 156 has become my choice for everyday transportation.

On the outside, the 156 stands out among cars in its size with style that combines elegance and aggressiveness into one.  My 156 still turns heads even after two years of local market introduction.  Make no mistake, the 156 has been designed to last decades, and I have no doubt it will be a classic.

On the inside, you have a few choices of materials and trims to suit your character.  On the list are conventional fabric trim, various colors of Momo leather trim, or black Recaro sport seats with red stitching to suit your style.  If you get the Sport Pack (I, II, or III) you�ll get lowered suspension and orange on black instrument dials instead of black on silver ones on standard cars.  Alfa also has a long list of customized accessories though some are available only for the left-hand drive model.

The Drive

I�m writing this review based on the 2.0 T-Spark version as I have not driven the other models.  The 156 is well put together, better than its predecessor 155.  Opening and shutting the door now feels as solid as any Audi A4s or BMW 3 series.  Firing up the 4-cylinder engine tells you this Alfa is different from its German rivals.  The engine idles with a really sweet mechanical sound you can only hear from cars more than twice its price like a 911 or a Boxster.

I find the driving position to be more comfortable than other Alfas like the GTV.  Seats are supportive especially the Recaros, and the steering adjusts for reach and rake.  Outward visibility is good while gearshift and clutch are precise and comfortable for daily use.  The steering is quick, communicative, and well-weighted.  The Twin-Spark (two spark plugs per cylinder bank) engine is flexible with adequate torque in low rev, and good pulling power anywhere above 3000 rpm.  Tire and road noise are relatively well-insulated at cruising speed of 120 km/h.  Rear passenger room is adequate (roomier than E36 3-series and on par with current 3-series) while trunk space could be slightly larger for a FWD car.

My 156 is equipped with Sport Pack III (red Momo leather, 16� alloys, etc�) as well as an optional strut tower brace.  It rides on the firm (but never harsh) side through the bumpy streets of Bangkok.  On the freeway it�s very controlled and stable above average cruising speed.  It corners very securely, thanks to the quick steering, and with so much grip, it hardly steps out of line.  If you push it hard, it will understeer slightly and can be easily corrected.  

I have had an opportunity to drive one around a racetrack, and I can assure you that, given a sane and skilled driver, the 156 has the grip, the balance, and the handling that�s hard to find in this class of cars today.  

The Verdict

The 156 is a very fine car that offers driving enjoyment that only a test drive will show.  It has been reliable for me for the past year and 12,000 km under the notorious traffic of Bangkok.  Admittedly it�s not as well assembled as a Mercedes C-class, but it doesn�t cost that much either.  I recommend the 156 if you are looking for a special car that can be used everyday, or if you are bored with conventional executive cars like BMWs or Audis.  Before you get one, check with your dealers if you can customize it the way you want, but be warned, demand outstrips supply.  I waited 4 months because the dealer special ordered it from Italy but it is all worth it.
