            GM has a winner on their hands with the Olds Alero.  Personally, I purchased a 1999 Black GLS Coupe with a Sun roof, spoiler, CD/Cassette and a V-6. Color: Black Onyx

After doing considerable amount of research, and after being unimpressed with other comparable models, I decided on the Alero because I felt it had the qualities I was looking for:

Ageless looks.
Solid Power.
Quality construction.
Roomy and Comfortable Interior
Enough toys to keep me happy.

The Alero fits the bill nicely.  

The V-6 (don't bother with the 4) moves this car nicely.  Acceleration is great - better than I expected.  Top speed of 114 (governor limited) is a little disappointing.  The car can easily handle (and produce) faster speeds, but this is Oldsmobile after all.  

Speaking of speed, this car seems to love doing 80 MPH. In fact it doesn't seem happy unless it's cruising at that speed or better.  That's a nice feeling, but I did notice that it tends to drift slightly as the speeds get faster. Nothing that can't be handled, but still...

The brakes are exceptional in this car (which certainly helps when you drive fast).

The 6-way power seats are pretty decent as well. I've taken this baby on a trip from NJ to Florida and the comfort level was very high.  I experienced very little back fatigue.

The interior is sharp looking, with a nice crisp blue dash that shines brightly through the night.

But alas, there are some problems with this car...and, as with anything, they may be related just to mine...

Both doors seem to be rattling a lot.  I had it fixed once - was told it was a misaligned weather stripping.  Well, the problem has come back. On jittery roads, with the radio off, it's down-right annoying.  

Second, I'm not thrilled with the paint job - specifically on the front hood. There seems to be a slight haze that I can't get rid of.  I was told that the hood is painted differently to protect it from the excessive heat it endures.  Oh Please.

All in all, I really can't complain. With an 80 mile round trip daily commute, I've racked up almost 50,000 miles in just 18 months with this car.  And aside from the doors, it's worked perfectly.

As you've probably gathered, I drive hard and fast.  I don't worry about gas mileage.  When I hit the gas, I expect to go.  So far, the Alero has performed to my expectations.

It's a shame the Olds is phasing out. I would have liked to see the next generation of Alero's...
