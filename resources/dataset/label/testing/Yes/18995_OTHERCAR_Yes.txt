            This is not going to be an in depth review of the 2003 Tiburon, simply an opinion based upon my thoughts of the vehicles during the time I have driven them (two of them) and also having previously owned a 1986 Hyundai Pony (or Excel in the USA) I thought I should write a quick review.

I have generally positive thoughts about Hyundai Cars in general, even although my old Pony/Excel was a very cheaply built car and was by no means approaching my expected standards set by many years of driving/owning Japanese cars. The reasons that I chose to buy the car in the first place were firstly that it was based upon tried and tested Mitsubishi mechanicals and secondly, price &#150 US$400 for a 6 year old car! (This was back in 1992).

Well moving forward to 2001 and working in the USA I was almost tempted to purchase the 2001 Tiburon which I thought looked pretty sharp indeed for a Hyundai. I was somewhat disappointed to find that although the car looked decent from the outside it was certainly a very cheaply constructed car internally. I looked at a few used examples and found unusually high wear patterns on virtually all of them. In the end I bought a used Nissan 240SX SE and it was a much better quality car in every respect.

Well now that the 2003 Tiburon has been on the market it would appear that the interior build quality of the vehicles has increased tremendously! The feel of the materials appear to come from a difference brand of vehicle altogether - compared to the 2001 Tiburon at least. 
I&#146d say that the interior reminds me of the Mitsubishi Eclipse overall &#150 there also appears to be a few styling similarities too. For example, internal door handles and central air vents.

The V6 equipped car has a nice amount of power to play with and I have been quite impressed with the car overall. There are a few minus points with these cars though.
The action of the top mounted button for the auto-changer is somewhat cheap and sometimes does not allow you to disengage from the &#147Park&#148 position &#150 this happened in both of the Tiburons that I drove. The current Tiburon that I am driving has malfunctioning central locking and the fuses have blown for the mirrors and electric windows. The side skirts (ground effects in the USA??) are fairly badly chipped from peoples heels entering and exiting the vehicle. This is a rental car from Budget so it is perhaps abused more than a personal vehicle would be? I cannot find any fuse that controls the central locking function so that will have to be repaired by Budget when I return the car after my monthly rental.

Most people who see that car find it hard to believe that it is a Hyundai and are quite impressed with the overall style and looks. Personally I have mixed feelings for the styling of the car, the style generally appeals to me but it is not 100%.

I do enjoy driving this car though &#150 the performance and handling is to my expectations of what this vehicle should be. The only minus point on performance is the very low miles per gallon when not continually driving on the highway. 20mpg is all you will get driving conservatively around town and taking short to medium distance trips. On a good run you will achieve 30mpg if purely doing highway miles. These are actual figures from my own driving experience of the cars - not the Government supplied figures.

I&#146d like to try driving a manual (stick) version of this V6 powered Tiburon to see what difference it makes to my impressions of the car. The auto-box is pretty responsive and would not be put off owning one that was not a manual version.

At the end of the day, I&#146m not sure Hyundai would be getting my money for this car though &#150 I think the price is too close to the Japanese competition. The car is certainly a huge leap in the evolution of Hyundai cars towards a better quality vehicle. 

In summary, if you have never considered a Korean car &#150 check out the 2003 Tiburon!
