            Ok this all started when i was 12, i saw a 3000 GT rolling down the street and almost cussed out loud in front of my parents i loved the car so much.  At that instant i knew it had to be mine.  Now im 16, have a job actually movin around between 2 jobs, making pretty good money.  So i decided since i was driving since i was 14-15 (with a hardship) and had to drive a Van for all that time, that it was time to treat myself.  So the first thing i did was look around everywhere, but every 3000 i was looking at would get snatched out right from under me since i wouldnt settle for anything less than the powerful and luxurious VR-4 Model it was a feat to find one.  
     Finally when almost all hope was lost i found it, a 97 3000 GT VR-4 at a dealership. I literally had to fight 4 people for the car because we waited for 30 minutes there waiting for people to finish test driving it before us.  I found out all the facts about the car from a representative and i couldnt wait any longer, to get people from out of the car i had to put down a check for the amount of the car.  You should of seen the shock on the people's faces about to test drive the car when they yelled over the loud speaker &quot;That car is Sold.&quot; i couldnt believe it a 16 year old with a 97 VR-4.  
     Now dont get me wrong im not rich or anything i just found the best price possible, im paying for it also with only my own money and a helpful 6 year loan but its worth it.  It came with Twin Turbo 6.0L V6, custom exaust (3 inch HKS cutback Dragger) Chrome rims, and all leather interior, 6 speed manual, 10 cd changer, sunroof, every possible option.  It is the Nicest car ive ever been in or seen for that matter.  Plus people dont know the real power of this car with the all wheel drive i can jump off the line like Nothing the turbos kick in and your head is buried in the leather.  It handles like a DREAM nothing can take a corner like this car.  Also with a top speed of 180 (which it can EASILY do and more the needle will be twitching way past the 180) plus the fact it can go about 110 in 3rd gear really helps.

    The base 3000 VR-4 comes with 350 HP which is already enough although mine currently has 380-390+ with the exaust and custom headers ive also added makes this car Fly.  I dont think ill ever get rid of this car since the chicks love it, i love it, everyone loves it, and i have my whole life ahead of me.

     I recommend this car to everyone, but dont because the other reason why i love this car is because it makes people go &quot;Damn what kinda car is that&quot; because it is a &quot;rare exotic&quot; and you dont see em every day.<br><br>
