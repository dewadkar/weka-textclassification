            My wife was shopping for her first new car. She wanted the high seating position of an SUV but wanted something very simple to handle. I insisted that she get ABS brakes because I feel that they are worth it here in New England.

We considered the Suzuki Grand Vitara but it the inside was too small for me: it was claustrophobic. The RAV4 was just too expensive after getting all the options you wanted. WE settled on The Honda CRV EX because it comes with a ton of options for 1 price. We get A/C, power locks/windows, ABS brakes, real time 4 wheel drive, a stow away picnic table in the back, plus more for 21,000.

This CRV was nice because it automatically engages the 4 wheel drive when it senses the front wheels slipping. This car is front wheel drive when not in 4 wheel drive. There are no buttons are 4x4 select shifters for my wife to deal with. So she wouldn't be able to make a mistake and ruin the transmission. It's foolproof for a non-technical person. The transition into 4 wheel drive isn't even noticeable and is seamless.

U-turns and parking are real easy with this SUV. My wife had only driven small cars and was scared of "something big". But she never had any problems with driving this SUV.

We only have a few complaints, one is the seating position in the drivers seat; I feel like I'm driving a bus as I'm sitting bolt upright and the angle of the steering wheel is kind if flat. Also, when you are stopped on a steep hill in drive, you roll back when you lift your foot off the brake. I've heard of other CRV's doing this. 

We have had this SUV for about 1 and 1/2 years now and there have not been any repairs needed. All we have done is change the oil and rotate the tires.

My sister and law bought a 2002 CRV shortly after we bought the 2001 model. For about $1500 more, she got a 6 disc CD changer, moon roof, more horsepower engine, smoother ride, and side air bags. None of which we got. We felt slighted by Honda. We wished we had waited although we still feel that we have a great car. However, this means that you can buy a pre-2002 model used CRV really cheap. 

Another complaint, not really related to the car, is the Honda service. The dealer's don't seem to care about customer satisfaction and the service hours, in my area, are inconvenient. They are a little unfriendly ie. "If you don't like it here go elsewhere".
