            I want everything in a car: power, 4WD, good gas mileage, lots of cargo room. I'd love to buy American, but there's no American car that offers all the features of a Subaru for a comparable price.

Four wheel drive and ABS are the two main must-have features for anyone who ventures into the mountains on winter days. To get that in an American car, you'd have to go for something like the Ford Explorer, a big, gas guzzling machine, several thousand dollars more expensive than a Subaru.

The only possible alternatives to a Subaru might be a Honda CR-V or a Toyota Rav4, but they both have several cubic feet less cargo space. Also, I feel they don't have quite as nicely appointed interiors as the Subaru Outback.

I recently purchased my third Subaru wagon in a row, and they just keep getting better. The last time I purchased a non-Subaru car was 15 years ago.

The all-wheel-wheel drive and ABS work great. You don't even know they are there until you need them, and then they work automatically. You don't have to do a thing. All-wheel drive gets me up the mountain.  ABS gets me safely down. I have not had to put chains on in the last 12 years, even though I frequently drive up to various ski areas in all kinds of weather.
Not only do I not need chains, but even highway patrol police recognize that I don't need it. Last Winter, I was waived on by a patrolman who was topping other cars and making them chain up.

ABS brakes startled me the first time I felt the break pedal vibrate like something was breaking underfoot, but I soon realized this is how it's supposed to work. And it does work. It stops me every time, even on very icy roads.

The Outback has reasonably good gas mileage, though there's always room for improvement. I seem to be getting an average of about 22 miles/gallon in a mix of city and highway driving. I got as high as 28 and as low as 19 miles/gal.

The Outback turns on a dime. I have often made a U-turn on a suburban neighborhood street without having to backup and without driving over the curb.

The interior design has some nice touches. I really like the overhead map lights (similar to those on a passenger plane). Also, an overhead storage box for sunglasses. The latest models also have niceties such as heated side mirrors, that manage to clear fogged mirrors within a very short time. 

Another nice feature on the higher end models is heated driver and front passenger seats. All this makes Winter driving a pleasure.

The Outback does indeed have all the features I am looking for: comfortable car-like ride, plenty of passing power, safe winter driving with all-wheel drive and ABS brakes, lots of storage space in the back, lots of interior goodies, and on top of that, the latest Subaru Outbacks also come with a keyless remote lock and alarm system.

How would I improve the car? Better gas mileage would be great. Also, I would like to move the cup-holder some place where it wouldn't interfere with the radio/cassette controls.<br><br>
