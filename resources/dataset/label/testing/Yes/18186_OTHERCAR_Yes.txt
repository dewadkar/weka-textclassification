            I have two small children, and previously owned a Ford Ranger Supercab. One day, while I was putting them in the jump-seats I tried to figure out how safe it was back there, and learned that night that children are 5 times more likely to get seriously injured while riding in side-sitting jump seats. That night I temporarily traded my 99 Ranger XLT for my in-laws 94 Pathfinder, while I looked for a new car.

I never really considered the Pathfinder, I just didn't like them for some reason, but I did not know anything about them. My initial list came down to five SUV's, in this order:

Chevy Blazer
Ford Explorer
Honda Passport
Toyota 4 Runner
Nissan Pathfinder

I test drove any SUV I could for weeks (while commuting with the 94 Pathfinder) and my final list came down to these two:

Ford Explorer
Nissan Pathfinder

While commuting with the 94 Pathfinder, I was struck with how well it drove and handled, it was much nicer than my new truck, but to be honest, Pathfinders are expensive and hard to purchase in the Twincities. Ford explorers however are like bellybuttons, everyone's got one. That means there are a lot for sale. I had made up my mind about buying an Explorer, then I read a fateful review in Car and Driver. The reviewer stated that the Explorer is a decent vehicle, but its like eating sawdust, bland as hell, and you can't spit out your front door without hitting one. That man hit it on the head, I decided I was going to purchase a Pathfinder.

Here is what I got:

96 Nissan Pathfiner, $13,500
64,000 miles
Leather, CD, Luggage Rack, Side-steps
Power Everything, heated seats, moon-roof.

I have been driving it for a month and a half and I love it. Here is a list of the pros and cons

PROS
-----
<b>Quality</b> - Feels solid, everything in good shape.
<b>Looks</b> - With side steps, luggage rack, and new body style it is a good looking machine.
<b>Driving</b> - This is the best part, it is the best handling SUV on the market. I park in a ramp every workday and it handles the turns like a sports car.
<b>Cargo Space</b> - Has more room than most SUV's.
<b>Resale</b> - They hold their value extremely well.

CONS
-----
<b>Power</b> - I am used to a 4.0 LTR Truck and the older Pathfinders (pre 2000) just do not have as much power as comparable models.
<b>Gas Millage</b> - Even though it has less power that my previous truck, it gets the same gas millage (15 city, 20 hwy).
<b>Non - BOSE Stereo</b> - (minor gripe) My pathfinder did not have the cool Bose stereos most of them had, and I am going to have to replace the CD-Player (it skips too much) with a new MP3 Player (poor me).

All in all, I would say I love my Pathfiner and more importantly the kids love it and are much safer.
