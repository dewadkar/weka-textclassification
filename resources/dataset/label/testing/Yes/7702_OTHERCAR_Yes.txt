            The reason I bought this vehicle is because I do a lot of driving and was tired of bigger automobiles running me off the road. My last car was a Chevy Corsica and while I loved that car I felt very vulnerable every time I drove anywhere. Now that I have the Tahoe I can see everything going on in front of me and I know what's happening miles ahead. I feel much safer and the Tahoe is great to drive, it's very comfortable for it's size. I recommend this sports utility vehicle to anyone considering buying one. I was intimidated by it's size at first but now I feel like I'm driving a regular sized car. I just love it. It's very easy to park which I thought would be trouble especially parallel parking, it does take a little getting used to but after a couple of weeks or less it's like you never drove anything else.<br><br>
