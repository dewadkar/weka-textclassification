            When I purchased my 2001 Olds Bravada, I shopped around for months before I made my decision.  The reason I chose the Bravada is because of the value for the price.  

I am a Bells and Whistles person.  My vehicle must have all the features and the Bravada has more than any other SUV in its class!  It is the Cadillac of SUV's, in fact; the Cadillac Escalade was modeled after the Bravada.  

The amount of features is too endless to mention, but I will mention some of my favorites.  It has OnStar service, which is incredible and gives me not only the quiet assurance of safety and protection, but I have my own personal concierge service at my fingertips.  Because of their global positioning wireless technology, OnStar not only acts as a hands-free cellular phone, they also give you directions to your destination and have planned many trips for me across the country.  They also can help you to find the nearest service station or give you reviews on the local restaurants! If you are in an unfamiliar area, you just press a button on your rear view mirror, a live OnStar advisor says Hello Mrs. (your name) you then tell them what kind of food you are interested in and they will tell you all of the restaurants in your immediate vicinity and will give you directions to the restaurant of your choice and will even make reservations for you.  They offer roadside and emergency assistance, remote lock and unlock, my husband feels good about my safety having OnStar. 

Well, enough about that, the comfort of the leather interior 
comes standard and is incredible.  It is softer than any leather I have ever felt.  

Like I said, the features that come standard in this vehicle were what sold me on it.  The Bose 7 Disc CD Changer, AM/FM Cassette stereo system is par excellence and the Smart-Trak all Wheel drive system has gotten us out of plenty of potential disasters.  It is almost impossible to get stuck!  We tested it ourselves in North Carolina in the mountains.  With one wheel on gravel, one on icy pavement and one in slushy snow, the Smart-Trak engineering gets you right out without hesitation. 

The 2-person memory seating with 8-way power including an adjustment for lumbar for the driver and passenger is awesome!  I can&#146t tell you how many times I have miserably gotten into a car after someone else has driven it and found the seat too far up and the Bravada, when you press the unlock button on your key fob, adjusts your seat automatically to the settings you have in memory!  Pretty neat huh?  All these things come standard - cruise control, heated power side mirrors, climate control air conditioning, 4 wheel anti-lock brake system, anti-theft deterrent system, split rear seating, towing package, beautiful ally wheels, full size spare tire, I guess I need to stop&#133 I could go on and on&#133.  I am just so glad that they changed their mind about discontinuing the Oldsmobile line!  I am glad I have one!
