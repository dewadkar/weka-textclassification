            Ever since it's release, the BMW M Roadster has been a man among boys. With its classic retro styling and famous BMW power and amenities, this car takes your breath away. 

There is not a lot more you can ask for in a sporty convertible. Even the word &quot;sporty&quot; doesn't do this stallion justice. With a DOHC 24-valve in-line-6 (3152cc), aluminium block and head, Siemens MS 41.2 engine-control system, and port fuel injection this tiger really purrs.

Talk about eating the road alive! This beast busts out 240 bhp @ 6000rpm/ 236 lb-ft @ 3800 rpm. What does this mean to a new driver? It means you will become one with your leather wrapped performance seats as you explode to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a convertible eh? ... That's what I thought too.

As for gearbox... this Beamer's five speed is ready and willing to help you &quot;release the hounds.&quot; Prefer a leisurely cruise through the countryside, leave her in fourth and let the car do the rest.

With a 13.5 gallon tank for the firewater, you'll be challenging the sun to see who will stay out longer. Plus, commanding a 26 mpg [EPA] fuel economy on the highway, your wallet won't be &quot;burning out&quot; quite as often as the fat 17&quot; Dunlop SP Sport's slapped on front and rear.

If you are worried about safety or upkeep, the folks at BMW have you covered. Along with a great service plan, this &quot;M&quot; onster can take care of itself. With built in front and rear anti-roll bars you have nothing to fear but other drivers. Also, my favorite, the engine control system mentioned earlier. From regulating the synthetics [which only seldom requires changing] to harnessing engine power this speedster has brains and brawn.

Inside this piece of poetry in motion you will find aggressive styling to suit the general mood. Because this baby is M enhanced, it includes all the modern amenities a boy [or girl] could ask for. Just don't expect to fit much more than two sweaty bodies ready to taste life as it should be tasted!

Overall, the BMW M Roadster is a well thought out convertible with crisp shifting, admirable brakes, and excellent midrange punch. Beyond that it's just a sweet looking cat that loves to run and looks great doing it!

You may ask why it is better to purchase a new model 2000 over a cheaper used version? It is quite simple really. Besides the growth in power alone, the newer models have added more of that retro styling you know and love, including wider fender flares that can allow for a beefier rear tire.

Not sure about getting a convertible because of your hometown climate. Talk to your dealer about the optional lock-in hardtop.  <br><br>
