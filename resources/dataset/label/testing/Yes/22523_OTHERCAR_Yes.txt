              In your youth and wanting a sports car? Looking to fulfill that second childhood dream? Proud parent looking for the perfect, long-lasting graduation gift? Try the Chevrolet Cavalier Z-24.
  This car is a dream. Everyone I have spoken with have nothing but raves for this little muscle car. The price is perfect, especially since it has great lines, lots of high-end power, loads of options, and the longevity everyone wants.
  The reason I like this model is I own one. I have put almost 200,000 miles on it in the first 5 years I drove it. I have had three problems; 1. the alternator went out, 2. the battery died and, 3. the driver side window is now starting to stick.
  Following the maintenance schedule, I change the oil every 3,000 miles (or at least try to) and rotate the tires every 5,000 miles. The recommended mechanical inspections include a tune-up at 100,000 and 170,000. Not bad.
  This vehicle has served me well in the hot deserts where it is recommended you turn off your air-conditioning while climbing hills. Sorry folks, I haven't yet and still pass all the cars on the climbs without over heating. It has also served me well in the snow where I needed assurance that the braking would not let me down on some of those steep grades and it would not over torque while trying to climb those snow-covered passes.
  Yes folks, this is a wonderful and extremely reliable vehicle.The best thing yet, it fits my 6'4&quot;, 255 lbs frame very comfortably.
