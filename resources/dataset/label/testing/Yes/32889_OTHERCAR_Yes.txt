            I purchased the Canon S300 took take what I hoped would be an enormous amount of great photos of my son. To often it's hard to know whether it's the camera or the photographer that makes the difference. In this case, most of my pictures are really good, so I'm guessing the camera is really helping out. Here is my synopsis in brief:

Good:  
1. Like any digital you can take hundreds of photos and only keep the good ones.  This particular camera has taken some excellent photos that had led me to put aside my Elph Advantax camera in favor of this one.
2. The small size means this thing is going in my pocket everywhere.  I never have to worry about "dragging" it around, especially when I'm on vacation.
3. Ease of use. This is my first digital and there is really nothing to learn.  I literally just started taking pictures the same day.
4. Solid feel - Although small, you feel like this camera was made well. Many of the other Digital�s feel like plastic.  This one really feels like a solid piece of electronics.

Bad:
1. Price - It's not only the camera you�re buying, but the extra battery and the bigger card (I'd recommend nothing less than 96 mb, but the 128 seems to be perfect).  By the time you're done you've spend about 600.
2.  AVI's - These are cute, but a little unnecessary. The files end up being about 3-4 MB's to send in the highest resolution, which makes this a little difficult to send an receive. More of a gimmick, than a value- added option.
3. Red-Eye - I seem to get a ton of red-eye even when I switch to manual mode. The software the camera came with does allow you to fix it up, but this is still a time consuming endeavor.
