            <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
I rented a 2004 Explorer for a week, turning in a 2004 Chevy Lumina after the snow started pouring down.  I had the opportunity to put several hundred miles on it, in the city, on the highway, and even on some very light off-road surfaces, in a combination of dry, wet, icy, and snowy conditions.  Turned out to be quite a road test for such a short time.

<b>EXTERNAL</b>
There's been a bit of updating of the exterior in the new 2004 Explorer - mostly smoothing of the lines.  It looks a little bigger than previous models, and a bit more truck-like, in my opinion.  The base XLS model I rented has black trim (upscale models have body-color trim), but did include foglights mounted in the front bumper.  It still looks pretty generic, and in the style category, I'd rate it dead average.  The four doors have thick and sturdy pull handles that would give you a lot of purchase in an emergency, and they open and close smoothly and firmly.  The Explorer I drove had the optional keypad lock, in addition to the remote and the old-fashioned key.  The rear hatch covers the entire back surface, and opens and closes easily, exposing the entire cargo area for packing without rising so high as to bump into low garage ceilings.

<b>RUNNING GEAR</b>
<i>Motor</i>
The standard 4.0L V6 (210hp/254ft-lb) isn't exactly powerful for this large of a vehicle.  It needed to rev pretty high for decent acceleration, but seemed to do an OK job (with an empty vehicle).  Load it down, and I think you'll find differently.  The Optional V8 (not available in XLS trim) produces 239hp at a more leisurely 3100RPM and 284 ft-lbs of torque, and has nearly the same MPG expectations.  I'd go with the V8 if I were to purchase an Explorer.  <i>Update:  I have since had the opportunity to drive the V8 model, and even during a short jaunt loaded to the gills with 6 adults and one 8-year-old (quite squeezed in, and required moving my luggage to the other rental), it seemed to have plenty of pull.  Definitely better than the V6</i>

<i>Transmission</i>
This Explorer was equipped with a 4-speed automatic (plus Overdrive, effectively giving you 5 forward gears).  The shift operation is the same it's been for years - operated by a lever on the right side of the steering column.  A button on the end of the shift lever allows you to disable the overdrive for towing, hilly driving, etc.

The 4x4 transfer case is automatic as well.  Three buttons on the right of the instrument panel allow you to select 4x4 Auto, 4x4 High, or 4x4 Low.  In the "Auto" mode, the 4x4 transfer case works as needed - activating the front differential when the rear wheels begin to slip.  4x4 High locks the transfer case into 4WD, and is designed for travel at moderate speeds on slippery surfaces.  4x4 Low locks the transfer case into 4WD and drops the engine-to-drivetrain ratio significantly, allowing you to get extra torque in extreme situations.

<i>Other "Functional" Options</i>
This Explorer was equipped with the optional towing package, which includes a transmission cooler and receiver hitch.  The Explorer, equipped in such a fashion, is rated to tow up to 3400 lbs, which includes any weight in the vehicle itself.  With the V8, towing capacity moves up to 7,140 lbs (but still comes equipped only with a 3,500 lb Class II hitch).

The roof rack is like most factory roof racks - mostly useless.  It's limited to how much weight it can support, and for it to be used for bikes, skis, or the like, requires quite a lot of accessories.

The Explorer comes standard with driver and passenger front airbags.

<b>INTERIOR</b>
This model was fitted with cloth upholstery and optional 7-passenger seating... ummm... yeah, right.  The front buckets were OK.  The driver's seat is power adjustable: fore-aft, up-down, seat tilt, and seatback tilt.  A manual knob allows you to adjust lumbar support.  A large console sits between the two seats, with lots of storeage and coin slots. Two cupholders and a tray are in front of that, as well as a constant-on power port to supplement the regular cigarette lighter plug, which turns on/off with the key.  The large console makes up for the somewhat puny glovebox.

The middle row seating was a bit more cramped, especially with the front seats aft.  Power ports and rear climate/audio controls are located on the aft portion of the console for the middle occupants to operate.  Hiproom is fine with 2 mid-row passengers.  The third better be skinny.  The seat is split into thirds, allowing you to drop any 1, 2, or all three sections to make a flush floor (or to access the third row).  I didn't have my kids on this trip, but putting child seats in the two side seats would leave you unable to access the third row. Putting an infant seat in the recommended middle row center seat would make the other two seats unusable for long distances (and completely unusable for other child seats).  

The third row seating is even a bit more cramped - really only suitable for two kids or tiny adults.  Plus, putting it up eats up pretty much all of your luggage space.  It will allow you to bring a couple extra people across town (if you live in a small town) in a pinch.

With the exception of the third row seats, entry/egress is relatively simple for an SUV, especially with the passenger assist handles at all three passenger doors (which also might help during offroad excursions).  The driver must do with the steering wheel.

This Explorer was equipped with the optional AM/FM/Cassette, with 6-disk in-dash stereo.  Sound was good, though I don't normally play it at ridiculous levels.  The previous renter (or Hertz cleaning crew) must have been young, because it was set to a Hip-Hop station, with the Bass cranked to a booming high.  Took me a bit of figuring to change the Bass back to normal, but once I did, I found the controls somewhat intuitive.

The climate control system is operated by three large rotary switches with positive click positions.  The first controls fan speed, the second is a heat/cool rheostat, and the third controls where the air comes out of.  A button allows you to select Air Conditioning with any combination of these settings.  Heat was strong, and I had no need to try the AC.  I did find that when I selected heating from both upper and lower vents, that the supply to the feet was inadequate unless I closed some of the face vents.  

<b>FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT</b>
Visibility is as good as any small SUV, with your side and forward views obstructed only by the modest A-pillars.  Rear view is OK, as long as nobody is in the center seat.  Views to the 3:30 to 7:30 clock position are much more difficult, but assisted by large, remotely power-adjustable, sideview mirrors.  The mirrors, by the way, hold small courtesy lights on a timer which help guide your ingress/egress at night.

The instrument panel is clear and easy to read.  A digital temperature guage and compass indication is hidden in the lower right, below the odometer.

Controls for the front and rear wipers and washers are on the turn-signal stalk, while cruise-control is operated from the steering wheel.

The vehicle drives much like other small SUV's - not quite as "beefy" a ride as a full-sized pickup truck, but not as soft as most sedans.  Parking operations are fine - and the steering at slow speed, though not as tight as a smaller vehicle, is predictable and sufficient for city parallel parking.

At speed, the steering is tight, but not twitchy.  The ride was comfortable, and wind noise wasn't as loud as I remember from previous Explorers.

I didn't get to do any serious off-roading (prohibited by my rental contract, and no real opportunities during my trip anyhow), but since the running gear hasn't changed from previous models, I imagine that it will be more than adequate for most people's off-roading excursions.  It performed well in shallow to moderate snow, and during a short jaunt into a snow-covered field at my worksite.

Braking in all conditions - from dry to icy - was firm, controlled, and smooth.  The 4-wheel ABS works well and quite quietly.  Starting from a stop on ice or snow gave a bit of a lurch as the front drivetrain engaged, which didn't seem quite as refined.

Another thing that raised my eybrows was that, with the transfer case in 4x4 High, the front drivetrain would lurch or "bang" anytime I turned the steering past about halfway.  A bit of drivetrain roughness can be normal in 4x4's near the steering stops, but I think in this case it was a warning of future repairs in the works - and with only 13,000 miles on the odometer.

Fuel economy is rated at 15 MPG city/21 MPG Highway, while I managed about 17 through a week of varied driving.  Some of this may be explained by the time spent idling at my work site and in the hotel valet.

<b>OVERALL</b>
I find the Explorer to be highly average.  Average mechanicals, average interior, and average styling.  If you need room for 4, with occasional room for 7, moderate tow capacity, and decent light off-roading 4wd capability, it would be a good choice.  If you don't really need the 4wd (and most people, even in northern climes, don't), a minivan or stationwagon would be a better choice.  And if towing is truly important, you should probably look into the <a href="/content_115462737540"> Dodge Durango</a>, which I think would be a better choice.  Before buying, I'd do some good research into the drivetrain, though.
