            I purchased my 1997 automatic Accord SE coupe a little over a year ago with 62,000 miles.  This car is the 4th Honda that my husband and I have owned.  You can't go wrong with Hondas - they will last forever!  This car has lived up to this reputation.  I have put 14,000 miles on it and have only had one minor problem so far.  The AC had a small leak and wasn't blowing cold air.  It was a quick, cheap fix though ($100) - definitely worth it for the Georgia heat!  Other than that, it's just been oil changes and new tires.

While the car is not considered a sports car, you'll get a sporty ride in it.  It handles really well and is a lot of fun to drive on curvy roads.  My husband drives a Jeep Cherokee and he loves the way the Honda handles compared to his.  I love the look of the alloy wheels on my model - they help give it a sporty look too.

It's a pretty comfortable car and has a good amount of room both in the cabin and in the trunk for a coupe.  My husband and I have taken it on a few trips and it's been great.  There's plenty of room in the trunk for luggage, golf clubs, etc.  My husband, who is 6'2", also has plenty of room and is comfortable either as the driver or as a passenger.

There are a few minor things I dislike about the car.  It doesn't have enough pep when you're running the AC.  If I really want to accelerate, sometimes I turn the AC off.  When you're not running the AC though, it has pretty good pick up for a 4 cylinder.  We've had this pick up problem in all of our Hondas so it's not limited to this particular model. 

I've noticed this car seems prone to dings - I guess it's the materials used on the body.  I've seen a lot of other cars in this same model that have a lot of little dings too so it's not just that I have bad luck in the parking lots!

When I trade, I'll be ready for a bigger car.  I drove our Jeep Cherokee for almost 2 years before we bought this Honda and my husband officially took the Jeep over.  I miss all the room I had in the Jeep.  It's difficult to fit things in the Honda.  I often have to wait to purchase items such as small pieces of furniture, things from Home Depot, etc. because I simply cannot fit them in the car.  However, like I said, this car has a lot of room for a 2-door - I'm just ready to move on to something bigger!

My last Honda was a 1989 Accord LXI.  The seats in that car were more comfortable than in the 1997.  The interior on my 1997 also feels a little cheaper compared to the 1989, even though they were both comparable models.  Overall though, the interior is very nice.  I like the look of the faux woodgrain my 1997 has.  The controls are all in close reach and easy to read at night.  I like the look of the 1997 too with the curved dashboard, etc.  My 1989 was pretty boxy looking - both on the exterior and in the interior.

Overall, I've been very happy with this Accord, as we have been with all of our Hondas.  None of our Hondas has ever left us stranded and we know we can always rely on them.  The 1997 Accord coupe is an affordable, fun car to drive and I highly recommend it.  Needless to say, this will probably not be our last Honda!
