              On a recent trip up to Buffalo, NY I decided I was going to be renting a car. I took advantage of Hertz's two upgrade coupon and they gave me a Sable LS to drive for the weekend. Now, I've never been a fan of the Sable or it's more common Ford cousin, the Taurus so I was not expecting much from this car. Boy how times have changed!

Powertrain: B+
  This Sable had the old pushrod 3.0 Vulcan V6. Somehow Ford has managed to make this old workhorse into a fairly refined engine. Rated at only 153 horsepower, its no rocket. But it goes about it's business in a smooth quiet fashion. I can only imagine how much better the 3.0 liter 200 horsepower Duratec V6 engine is. The four speed automatic shifted quiet well, it even downshifted smoothy and quickly! Ford has really made great strides in the powertrain department. Its not as good a setup as the Maxima or Accord, but it is still VERY impressive.

Steering/Handling/Braking: B
   The Sable is a family car and it handles like a family car. Nothing really fun or precise here, but a very safe feel, a lot like Toyota's Camry. Most people will find the performance to be just right. The steering is more artificial than I like, but it does provide some feel. The suspension, while not able to provide sporty handling, DOES provide a supremely comfortable ride. The brakes work well but feel a bit mushy, but they stop the car well and the ABS works perfectly.

Interior: A+
   This a one nice environment! Ford has done a fantastic job with the interior of this car. Everything looks and feels as if it belongs in a Lincoln or even a Jaguar from the high quality plastics, to the chrome accents on the shifter and door handles! Most everything is well placed but there are some old school American car items, such as the headlights being on the dash rather than the turn signal stalk. The wiper controls are there instead of being on a seperate stalk on the right of the steering wheel. Nit picky, I know, but I'm used to Japanese cars. The rear seat is also quite roomy and comfortable. The trunk is HUGE! 

Exterior: A
   I hated the 1996-1999 Sable and Taurus. The ovoid design inside and out really hurt it in the marketplace. Ford realized this and fixed it for 2000. I prefer the Taurus's sportier looks, but the Sable is a good looking vehicle as well. There is a look of class and high quality about these cars that was missing from the old cars as well as many American cars.

Overall: A-
   Ford has really come through for the family sedan market. It took its ungainly looking family sedan and turned it into a true winner, with class, style and quality and comfort. I wish there was a sport version available since that would earn the Sable and Taurus a full five stars in my book, its THAT good!!! Even so, the Sable and Taurus represent Detroit's best efforts. I am proud to say the effort was well worth it. Well done Ford!!!!<br><br>
