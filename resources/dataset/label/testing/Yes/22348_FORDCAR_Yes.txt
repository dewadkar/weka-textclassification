            We bought an expedition recently and it is truly a great car. I also have a Chevrolet Tahoe that is pretty good too but not enough seats for my family of five. The expedition has the extra seat and in the 2000 series the third seat tilts forward for storage (great feature). It also has the new feature where the brake pedal moves to adjust to the driver (great for women). It also has heated seats which is great for cold regions. Other great features are heating and air controls for front and back. It has dual radio controls for front and back, this is ok for adults but may be a problem with kids at the controls in the second row seats. It is a tall car so you have to get use to getting and out (not a problem with us). We are truly glad that we bought the car. Another great feature is that the second seat can come down with the third still in place. Kids can have more comfort on long trips (tv in middle with all other junk between you and the kids for a little more peace). 
We bought a demo car and saved a lot of money, we had a choice of cars with around 2000 miles and saved about $5000!!!!! <br><br>
