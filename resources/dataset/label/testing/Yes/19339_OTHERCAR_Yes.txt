              My family has had this car for 10 years now.  I am now the owner of the car and absolutely love it.  I have added a few of my own things to it.  A home-built dual 10&quot; sub box, and let me tell you.  In that volvo, it really kicks.  I also cut out the fog-light holes under the front bumper and placed 2 blue halogen fog lights in them which really looks nice.  There is not a single spec or rust on the car, nor any water damage.  The car looks and drives 100% as it did when it was bought.  I love driving this car because it is such a smooth and sharp handling car.  It is my own personal Horse and carriage.<br><br>
