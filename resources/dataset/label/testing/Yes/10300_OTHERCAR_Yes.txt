            After several years of driving American cars, and having very bad luck, I finally broke down in 1996 and bought a 1995 Nissan Altima.  I had heard very good things about Nissan, and to be very honest, as &quot;Pro-American&quot; as I am, I was tired of buying cars that were consuming most of my income in repairs.  

I can honestly say that my Altima has been the best car I have ever had.  Aside from general maintenance, I have not had to put a dime in repairs in to this car since I bought it.  I am now at 102,000 miles and she is still running like a champ.  I was slightly concerned about interior space when I bought the car because I have two children and has always owned cars that were relatively spacious inside. I can honestly say that interior room has never been a problem for us.  I can very comfortably fit my two children, and my Rottweiler in with no problems.  I have taken my Altima on short trips as well as long trips and it has never let me down.  

I would recommend this car to anyone who is searching for a reasonable priced car.  Of course there are people who are used to a certain type of car (ie. luxury car, sports car) and for those people I would obviously say that maybe the Altima isn't for you.  But for those who just want economy and dependability and are not too fussy about &quot;looking like a millionaire&quot; then this is definitely the car for you.<br><br>
