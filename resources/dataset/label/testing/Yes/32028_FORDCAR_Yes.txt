            I own a Ford Explorer 1996 XLT V6.  I must say, although I am an avid Ford Fan, I love this car because it has been through hell and it keeps coming back for more.

The reason I say this car has been through hell is because of my driving skills.  Although I am a good driver I drive like a maniac (hey I live in New Jersey, what do you expect).  

In four years I have put 120,000 miles on this truck and it still rides very well.  Although there have been a few issues with the suspension (probably because I have gone off roading so many times), it is smooth and quite.

The engine itself although aged is still running relatively well. Some of the issues I have with it is it's idle and pickup form a full stop.  When I idle the Explorer it does have a rough shake to it ocassionaly, also when I go from a full stop to 10 mile per hour there is some hesitation.  

All in all I do believe the saying &quot;BUILT FORD TOUGH&quot;, I am planning to trade this Truck in and buy a Ford Focus.  I am now a Ford fan for life because of this Explorer.  Knowing what I put through it I am amazed it is still in one piece.

Some of the Drawbacks are:
- Low Gas Mileage
- V6 Engine is a little weak for the weight of the truck

Some Advantages are:
- FUN to drive
- Great for road trips
- Built Very Well
