            I'm not a Chevrolet truck owner...my husband is.  And, as the wife of a truck owner, I really don't have much opportunity to drive it or for the most part, think about it.  His truck is a 1989 Chevrolet Silverado that he purchased used about two years ago.  

At that time, I was pretty much open to whatever he wanted to buy.  I just didn't want him to spend a whole lot and hoped that whatever he bought wouldn't turn out to be a lemon.

Well, I can say that he made the right decision.  This truck is truly a rock!!  He drives it every day, our son drives it whenever Dad's not driving it, friends ask to borrow to move this and that, and that thing just runs like a top!!  It has over 90,000 miles on it, takes very little to maintain and even though its a V-8, gets relatively good gas mileage.  

If anyone is thinking about purchasing a used pickup truck, do yourself a favor and look for a Chevy.  If the one we have is any indication of reliability, they really are &quot;like a rock&quot;.<br><br>
