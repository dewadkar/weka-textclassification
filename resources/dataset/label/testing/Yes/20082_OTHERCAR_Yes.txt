            I love our new-used car (1995 Mazda Protege).  It's dependable and runs smoothly.  My daughter just loves to drive it.  Although it's not hers, she claims it!  She's always talking about how great it is.  This car is great for young drivers, like my oldest daughter.  It's safe, long-lasting and generally fun to drive!  This car would also be a great family car because it is very roomy in both the front and back.  The back seat folds down for more trunk storage.  The AC/Heat and stereo works great.  The house I live in is down a bumpy semi-gravel road and our current SUV takes the road pretty roughly, but our Protege glides down it like a boat on the water!<br><br>
