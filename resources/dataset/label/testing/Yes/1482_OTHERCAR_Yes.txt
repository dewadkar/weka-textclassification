            First, a little history on the Cougar for people who, like me, had no idea who or what it was until they saw the current model cruising down the road and said to themselves, "I've got to get one of those!".  NOTE: The following was culled from various web sites and newsgroups, the details may not be exact but it should generally be correct.

The Mercury Cougar started out as Mercury's answer to the Ford Mustang in the late 60's; a rear-wheel drive, 2-door muscle car with a powerful V8 engine.  In the 70's it transformed into a version of the Ford Thunderbird, a larger and more comfort-oriented vehicle, although the V8 and RWD remained (how or why exactly Mercury competes with Ford when Ford owns them, I'm still not clear on, but anyway...).  Mercury stopped production of the Cougar in 1997.  At approximately the same time, Ford stop production of their front-wheel drive sports car, the Probe.  The next-generation Probe had already been developed, so instead of letting all that development money go to waste, Ford decided to release it as the all new, next-generation Mercury Cougar in 1999.

The 1999-present Mercury Cougar is a front wheel drive car available in either a 4-cyclinder 125 horsepower (manual transmission only) or V6 170 horsepower engine (automatic or manual transmission).  These specs may sound familiar because they are very similiar to the specs found on the Acura Integra, Toyota Celica, and Mitsubishi Eclipse.  Basically, this is Ford/Mercury's answer to the import sports car market.  This is definitely not your father's (or mother's) Cougar!

OK, onto the review.  My configuration:
2001 Mercury Cougar
V6 engine w/ automatic transmission
Dark Shadow Gray exterior
V6 sport & V6 convenience packages
Anti-lock brakes
Sunroof

The V6 sport package comes with 4-wheel disc brakes and a spoiler (along with some minor cosmetic items) and the V6 convenience package has speed (cruise) control, remote keyless entry/alarm, and cd & cassette premium sound system.  I think these are all essential options except for the automatic transmission, which I know is taboo for many performance-conscious drivers.  FYI, from my own browsing I noticed around 80% of Cougars in stock were the V6 variety, and of those 80-90% were automatics, so you may need to look a bit if you want the 5-speed V6.  

Anyway, so far I've had the car a week and here's my impressions:


THE GOOD:
-- The exterior styling.  Ford's "new edge" design gives it a wonderfully sleek look.  It's not until you see it next to another sports coupe that your realize it's still a fairly sizable car (185 inches in length compared to 170-175 inches for the Integra/Celica/Eclipse).
-- Roomy hatchback.  Reminiscent of the Integra hatchback, but even bigger!
-- Solid handling and acceleration.  I drive an automatic so obviously I'm not a racer, but even with one there's plenty of get-up and go (at least after passing first gear) and the engine has a great purr to it.  Corners are nice and crisp.
-- Great brakes.  The 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS are rock solid and are able to stop on a dime (lots of brake dust on the front wheels, though, but that's just an annoyance).
-- Great value.  Especially with the current rebates being offered by Ford ($2000 off any Cougar at the time of this writing), this car is thousands below a comparably equipped import.

THE BAD
-- Questionable reliability.  The 1999 model had several recalls and it's not hard to find owners on the internet griping about chronic problems that can't or won't be fixed.  Not so much so for the 2000 or 2001, but it's difficult to tell if that's due to better vehicle quality, less customers, or just not enough time to judge.  Long-term reliability can make or break your opinion of a vehicle, so it's definitely something to consider.  Still, so much evidence is anecdotal (you can find complaints on message boards for virtually any car) that buying ANY car is a bit of a gamble.
-- Door handles.  A minor gripe and the only real form-over-function complaint I have about the Cougar's styling.  The outer door handles are too small and don't quite give you full control of the door when opening it, and the inside handles are placed right by the inner hinge so that you must take your hand off of it to push open the door, instead of having it all be one motion.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but after a week it's still awkward.
-- Sunroof is solid metal, it's not a moonroof (that is, it's not a glass plate that you can look through even when closed), so if you're a sun worshipper it's not ideal.
-- Cramped rear seat.  All those extra inches went to the trunk, not the rear seat.  Anyone over 5'10 is gonna be squeezed but frankly a) what do you expect for a 2-door sports coupe, b) no one ever rides in my backseat anyway.  Having a roomy trunk for hauling big items is a much better use of room for me, but anyone with a family may disagree.

THE UGLY
-- Nothing!  It's gorgeous.  But I confess I'm still in the honeymoon phase.


Overall there is a LOT to like about this car.  Yes, reliability is the big question, perhaps the ONLY question that should stop you from rushing out and buying this car right now if you're looking for a sporty, value-packed coupe.  I guess that's stopping people because I rarely see these on the road and rumor has it they will be discontinued after the 2002 model.  This may go down in automotive history as one of the great near-misses, but it actually makes driving one all that much sweeter.  I'll update this review after a few months to give an idea of any problems that may come up.  Otherwise I say, go take a look at one immediately!!
