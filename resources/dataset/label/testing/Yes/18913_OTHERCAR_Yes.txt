                In the late 1980s, Cadillac entered the Ultra luxury/sports car market with the Allante. Sadly, it was not a success due to lagging sales, and was dropped in 1993, by which time it had become a world class luxury touring machine.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

   Everything tells you that this is no ordinary Cadillac, from the bite and efficiency of the vented disc brakes, to the minimal body roll when cornering. The 1993 Allante has precise rack and pinion steering and a remarkably stiff convertible body. The Northstar V8 has incredible low down torque, especially for a V8 this of this size in 1993. The Allante has a raspy exhaust note that only a well refined V8 could make. This is a front wheel drive car, so there is a slight hint of torque steer, But all in all the Allante offers excellent <b>performance.</b>  Apart from that, the Allante is a quiet, competent, and a comfortable cruiser.

   Early Allante's came with the 4.1 liter OHV V8 which was cast iron. It was stroked in to 4.5 liter in 1989, and in 1990 had a power output of 200 bhp. For 1993 all Allante's got the 4.6 liter, 32 valve, Northstar V8. This is an all alloy unit with four valves per cylinder and four chain driven camshafts. Fuel is provided by sequential multipoint fuel injection and a spark plug for each individual cylinder. In the 1993 Allante the engine produces a more than healthy 290 hp, and 290 lb-ft of torque. This is only 10 hp less than the 2002 Seville STS, and has more torque than the 1993 mark VIII, which also has a 4.6 liter DOHC unit. All Allantes' for 1993 came with 4-speed automatic transmission which enabled a fair 24 mpg freeway.

  Underneath the Allante rides a modified Eldorado front wheel drive platform. However, the all strut <b>suspension</b> is altered, with different valves in the shock absorbers, and different bushes to give a more direct, sports car feel. A single transverse leaf spring is used at the rear, like in the Chevrolet Corvette.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>Interior</b> of the Allante is very luxurious as one would expect for a car with a sticker price of almost $70,000. 'Super supportive' leather seats are fitted. The leather, unlike the leather in many American cars of this era, is quite desirable, and almost 8 years later when I drove this car, they remained exactly that. The Allante's ergonomics are very well laid out, and amenities are plentiful. A cold AC, an unique dash, a thick leather wrapped steering wheel, and power everything is standard. The Allante offers tons of room, especially for a two seater. <b>Note:</b> In 1993 a drivers airbag was standard in the Allante.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>Exterior</b> is sleek and classy, yet retains a sporty look at the same time. For an appealing and wind cheating style, the Allante's design was inspired by Pininfarina. The bodies were built in Turin Italy, and flown into the U.S.A via boeing 747s. Final assembly of the  Cadillac Allante was carried out at GM's Hamramck plant in Detroit. (This is Information I found Via the Internet.) The '93 Allante comes with a traditional Cadillac grille, flush mounted headlamps, and very sexy alloy rims. The '93 Models can be distinguished by the 32 V northstar logos. 

  <i>Price and Reliability</i>

 A 'World class' automobile will not run cheap. In 1993 these cars were being sold for almost $70,000! Today with poor resale value, and this car not being quite 'classic material' yet, a '93 Allante can be had for less than 40K, although I have only seen one priced this low, and good luck finding one! The '93 Allante is a very rare find. The 4.6 liter unit fitted only in the '93 Allante has been used for years now which has been given rave reviews for reliability and performance.
