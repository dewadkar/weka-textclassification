            This camera is one of the best I have ever had. It takes really good clear pictures. It is very easy to use all you have to do is put in a 3.5 floppy disk turn it on and you are set. I use this for online business and it sure made a big difference because people could now see the things they were buying instead of me just telling them about the product. It is also very easy to use the email feature it has when you take a picture it has it set up so when you put the disk in the computer all you have to do is click a button to email the pictures you just took. So if you are business person or just a family person that likes to save pictures this camera is for you.<br><br>
