            Let&#146s review this fun car!

Driving: 2.0-liter, 130-hp DOCH engine. This engine loves to rev. Smooth shifting 5 speed is standard, but you also can get Sport AT 4-speed automatic that comes with manual mode for sequential shifting up or down. Fully independent suspension supplies MP5 with amazing agility. A brace across the front strut towers reminds me of some expensive sports cars, increases stability and stiffens chassis.  Rack-and-pinion steering is easy and smooth to help you handle all the fun you want. Standard power-assisted 4-wheel disc breaks perform very well and provide nice feel. ABS (anti-lock brake system is available as an extra option, along with side-impact air bags. Good gas mileage, 25city/31 hwy (manual) with 14.5 gallons of fuel cpacity.

Exterior: Very sporty! Oversized fog lights, aggressive front air dam, racy rear spoiler, killer 16-inch alloys with high performance Dunlop tires. Rear lift-gate spoiler with integral center brake light. Rear roof-mounted radio antenna, luggage rack with adjustable rear cross bar. Dual power remote mirrors, 2-speed intermittent windshield wipers, rear wiper/washer with intermittent setting. Clear-lens halogen headlights and front fog lights. The car looks like it just came out of custom shop.

Interior: 2nd generation dual front air bags. 60/40 split rear seatback with fold-flat capability. Power windows with 1-touch-down feature, power door locks with that comes with remote keyless illuminated entry system. Silver gauges with red night time illumination. Leather-wrapped sport steering wheel with tilt, cruise control, AM/FM/CD stereo with 6 speakers, including 2 tweeters.
