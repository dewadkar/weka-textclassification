            let me start out by saying i have had my 4500 a year now. this is my second digicam (the first being one of the first generation olympus units).

i never used to use my digicam. the pictures were ok. but they looked like they were taking with a webcam. i never would have considered printing them. it was a nice toy, but i took my general photos with a 35mm.

last year changed all that. i bought a coolpix 7500 on the recommendation of a photographer friend. i wanted a semi-decent consumer model and he suggested this new camera based on previous nikon experience.

good points. the camera takes great photos, is very flexible with powerful features but can left in automatic for anyone not wanting to bother and still take great pictures. it uses standard CF memory cards. nikon has been doing this for a long time and i shows in the quality of the construction, the ease of use of controls and the unique styling. do not underestimate the flex body as a gimmick (as i initially did). you'll be taking amazing photos very conviently. two friends have digicams (a canon and a sony) and while they were twisting their necks to get good angles or shooting above a crowd blindly, hopeing for a good shot. i twisted the body, kept my head at a comfortable position, was able to frame a good shot and see what i was getting. both friends were extremely jealous. camera price is even better than what i paid for it. good support (firmware upgrades too) from nikon.

bad points. battery life definately could be better. granted i keep the LCD on all the time. use flash maybe on half the photos. i get about 80-90 shots (highest quality and resolution) before the low battery light goes on. a spare battery is definately handy ($25 or so). i have two 128M cards and can fit about 80-90 photos on each card so it does work out pretty well. there are not many accessories for this camera (4 lenses or so from nikon) and they aren't cheap. i'd love to dabble and play with a fish-eye or telephoto lense, but not for $150 or so. when i got my cam it came with a 16Mb card. completely useless. all of the features can be daunting to someone new to photography (like me). the manual explains what things are but not how best to use them.

i've had my camera a year now. i've taken hundreds of photos. i am VERY happy with this purchase and it has addicted me to digital photography.

an extra note. i purchased a hp 7350 printer a few months later and the combination is excellent. i have a usb CF reader and a macintosh running iPhoto. importing and organizing photos from the camera is simple and easy. if i want i can edit them in iPhoto, Photoshop Elements or Photoship itself. prints out of the printer are amazing on 4x6 photo paper. family members thought they were taken with my 35mm camera. best part is printing out only the photos you want and making easy duplicates.
