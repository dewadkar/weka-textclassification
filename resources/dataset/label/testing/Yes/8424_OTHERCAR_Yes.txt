            I have been using a Olympus D-600L digital camera for about a year now. This cameraï¿½s strongest point is the quality of the photographs it takes. They are the best I have seen from a digital camera, and we have several here around the office and our job sites. It is so good, I have even been using it in-place of a scanner for large documents such as posters or architectural drawings. 

The problems with the camera really can be summarized by saying the user interface is very poor. This camera is not intuitive at all. It is awkward to change the settings and to understand what the camera is doing. I have also had both the camera and the included software for the PC crash several times. I do not loss photos but it is hard get the camera going again, I needed help form the tech support line to do so.

Its other weak points are the slow serial interface to the PC and the need for lots of batteries. 

If you by this camera you will NEED the rechargeable batteries, trust me.
