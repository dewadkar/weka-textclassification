            This here is a car in a class all its own . Round of applause to a company that has come so far from when they started . Some people don't think much of the E320 ; but this car has it all but the kitchen sink . Very beautiful body style with a sleek sporty look . Trunk space you can get lost in . Back seat could use more leg room but it is still perfect for a family car . Front seat are a drivers dream with lots of leg room. An engine for you car nuts; what a pickup and go . Hate to see it go but oh well one can't keep it forever . Can't wait to see the new 1999-2000.
 Who ever said a luxury car cant be a sports car boy are they wrong.
