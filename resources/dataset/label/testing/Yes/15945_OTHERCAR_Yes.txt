            I was not prepared to be impressed, but I was.  I was not prepared to have fun w/this camera, but I did.  I was not prepared to like the pictures that this camera takes, but I did.  I have to highly recommend this camera, and say that if this camera could win me over, then it's the digital camera to own, because I'm a tough sell!

The reason I was not prepared to love this camera is that I'm old school all the way.  I have always loved photography and have been shooting and developing (sometimes) my own film since I was a kid.  I never thought anything could replace traditional film, but after shooting with this camera and seeing the results, I am almost prepared to never use regular film again.  The images are <i>just that good!</i>

If you want an example, look at my picture in the left side margin of my reviews.  This shot was taken with this camera.  (It's a self portrait, for anyone interested in that kind of stuff.)  The camera comes with a view screen on the back and it sees what the lens sees.  As you point the camera around, the image you will be taking appears in the view screen.  I love this because you don't have to put the camera right up against your eye.  It's like shooting a movie almost.  The camera has various flash settings, so you can program it to flash just sometimes, or all the time.  It also has red eye reduction if desired.  The images are very easy to load into your computer memory.  With the right printer and photo quality paper, the prints come out very nice.  If you want, you can also use digital manipulation on the picture to change it the way you want to.  The camera comes w/manipulation software which I haven't used yet because I have some other programs for this.

Overall, this is an amazing camera.  I love it, and can honestly say that once you start using it, you may not be able to stop.<br><br>
