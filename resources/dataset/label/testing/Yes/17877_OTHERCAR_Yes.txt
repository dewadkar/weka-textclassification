            A friend of mine recently received a Chevy Blazer as a graduation present.  I am in love with it.  It is the smoothest riding vehicle I think I have ever ridden in.  Not only this, but it has the capability of going off road and enduring the most extreme conditions.  My friend has to take a 4 hour road trip when coming back from and going to college.  The Blazer has proven to be a worthy and dependable vehicle.  The one thing that my friend dislikes about the blazer is that he says it consumes too much gas.  But I imagine you get that with any SUV.<br><br>
