            I've used the camera for 10 months now and have a good idea of how well it works.  It delivers what it promises - lots of features for the money, easy to use, pretty small package.  I did buy a 32mb card and have not used the 8mb at all.  I like to take my pics at the highest resolution and get 42 pics with this card.

This is the kind of camera you can stick in your pocket and pull it out when you need it.  It has enough features to do what most amateur photographers need.  I use it more for snapshots rather than serious photography.

I like being able to plug it into the pc and download the photos.  I am not under the impression this takes a lot of battery power.  It only takes about 2-3 minutes to transfer the photos from the camera to my pc.  Batteries seem to last for more than 42 shots, and the transfer to my pc.  I consider that to be pretty good.  Besides, since the batteries are double A, and easy to replace, I don't have to get a proprietary battery from Fuji.  Buy re-chargable AA batteries.

You cannot see anything through the LCD screen in low light.  This is not a surprise.  If you look through the view finder - you only see 80% of the image.  It should be more accurate.

There is also a delay of a half second from when you push the button to the camera takes the pic.  Forget about catching some live action shot.

Overall - I like this camera a lot.  I will upgrade to a better one some day, but for now, I am satisfied with it.
