            I saw the Olympus C-211 Digital Zoom Camera for the first time on display at the Office Max store that I go to not far from my area.

  It sold for about $150.00 down from the regular $449.00 or so because it was a discontinued model. After looking at it for several weeks, I decided to buy it. The store had only 5 of them left at the time. So I bought it & took it home to try out for the first time with the flash, taking pictures of a scale model of the Twin Towers that I have ( the following week after I bought the camera the store had sold them all ).

   And they came out great! So when I went to New York City,
I took some of the most beautiful pictures of Ground Zero! 
But in the middle of taking those pictures, the batteries were very low, so I had to go to a store right across the street from Ground Zero to get some more batteries.

  I also took some pictures of the design proposals for the new WTC on display at Winter Garden. They came out great also! The resolution is great!

   Here are some of the features that this camera has:

   1. AFT Zoom 5.4-16.2mm Lense to let you photograph subjects from afar to make them appear a lot closer for close-up pictures.

   2. Digital quality offer crystal clear colorful results.

   3. Smart Media Card replaces annoying film development.

   4. Uses Polaroid 500 film to print photos taken.

   5. Has very good & high resolution for good picture quality.

   6. Viewing LCD monitor on back of camera lets you make small adjustments before you actually shoot your subjects. You must focus the subject in the image viewer before you shoot.

  7. Has an array of controls on the back such as lockout, focus, delete & shade adjuster.

  8.  Large knob in upper right-hand corner has settings like off, digital, print & setup.

  9. Large green button is used for printing pictures that you've already take onto the Polaroid film.

  10. Has lense cover to protect lense when not in use & adjustable nylon strap.

  11. Large lever with four tiny buttons are used for zoom adjustment, scanning photos taken & for on-screen displays on monitor.

  12. Red eye reduction.

  13. Video recording capabilities let you hook up camera to your VCR to view recordings made.

  14. Easy to use & maintain.

  15. Can also be used for making Qicktime movies.

  16. Silver button on front of camera below the lense is for shooting digital photos.

  17. Has self timer.

  This camera is an excellent choice for those who want good quality digital pictures and beats the old SLR camera ( I still have one of those too ). If all you want to do is just take pictures with this unit, you've got a real winner.

   The picture resolution is very good. And it really is a simple basic camera for the beginners! I found out though, that the higher the resolution of the pictures, the smaller the number of digital pictures you can take, so with slightly less resolution you can still get great pictures with a few more on the Smart Media Card.

   The smart Media Card slides into the lower right-hand side of the unit behind a little door, while the battery cartridge goes into the opposite lower left-hand side. To get at the batteries, you must first lift the release lever at the bottom front of the camera, then slide the battery cartridge out of the camera. Special features on the LCD monitor warn you if the battery power is low, memory card missing & the number of Polaroid shots you have left to use && more.

  The Polaroid 500 film is loaded at the top front of the camera. A slide lever on the left-hand side opens the compartment to allow you to load the film or remove the empty film cartridge. The Polaroid film use is optional. You only have to use the film if you want to print copies of the photos you've taken. This is handy if you want to see the pictures right away or if someone wants some pictures to keep.

   I also took the camera with me to Las Vegas and while vacationing there, I got some pretty good pictures of the famous hotels & attractions there!

   The software that came with the camera would not let me download the pictures into my computer, so I had to spend an additional $20.00 for a memory card reader. To accomplish that, you must first install the software that comes with the card reader into your pc. Then you simply slide the Smart Media card into the reader to download the pictures that you've taken.

   Finally, my only shortcoming is the battery power. I suggest that you keep a fairly fresh good supply with you. I had to do that when I visited Ground Zero. Also, this camera is a discontinued model but it still may be available
in some stores. 

Good exceptional value!

Daquan.
