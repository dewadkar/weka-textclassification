            My company purchased this camera three years ago when digital cameras were first starting to come into play to the consumer. We are a small advertising agency who needed to take shots of products for our clients for flyers and catalogs. We also propped the items outside and used it for on location many times. It takes awesome quality pictures. Good enough for us to use them in a 80 page catalog that went out to people all over the US. I've used a few other digital cameras and this one was way better than any of them as far as picture quality and ease of use. We are currently looking to upgrade our camera to a newer one, but that is only because we are giving the camera to a client. The price for these cameras have come way down, and they are closer to consumer level than they ever have been.
