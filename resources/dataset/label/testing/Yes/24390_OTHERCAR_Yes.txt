            OH MAN!  Take a look at this baby.  5 liter, 394 hp, and 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.  What else could you ask for?!  Well, first off, when I saw an M5 at the actual BMW dealership, i wanted it soo bad.  I was like a little kid wanting a piece of candy, but oh man, this was a whole lot more than a piece of candy.  The first time I saw it from the exterior, my jaw hung open and fell to the floor.  The car has the looks of an M-series BMW, with aerodynamic side mirrors, QUAD, yes, i said QUAD (that's 4) exhaust pipes, and 18" front and back tires.  It also had some amazing foglamps and xenon headlamps with clear blinkers on the side.  On the back of the car, there was also a little tail spoiler the pointed out from the car which added a little touch to the car and made it look like a rocket.

I began to think to myself "I want this car RIGHT NOW!".  But that was before I even looked at the interior.  The two front seats are M-design, sport, bucket, racing seats, and they're heated too!  I ran my fingers along the M multifunction steering wheel that had cruise control built into it and a BMW M sticker on it and sank right into the seats that were some of the most comfortable seats I had ever sat in, even more comfortable than an BMW M3.

I decided to take this incredible car for a test drive.  When I started up the engine, the car began to rumble.  It was ready to go at full speed, which is so great about the BMW M series.  I put the car into first gear, and that's when the 394 hp engine really showed.  I gave it some gas and the car flew.  You barely have to touch the accelerator to make it go.  When I got the car to go at some speed, about 45 mph, I just floored it, and boy did that thing take off.  I must have been going at 110 mph and I sunk right into those sport seats.  They were so comfortable.  Also, the car had a pretty quiet ride.  I could hear the engine rumbling, but that just made me happy to know that I had 394 hp under the hood.

I pulled into the dealership, and the first words out of my mouth were "I'll take it!".  I said this without thinking about the price though.  $70,000 is a whole lot of money, but then I thought to myself that this is a BMW, and when you are buying a BMW, you really do get what you pay for.  This car was really worth the $70,000 because not only did the car look amazing from the exterior through the interior, but it was really, really fast.  This car was really worth the money that I spent on it and is definitely a keeper.
