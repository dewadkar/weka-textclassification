            Like a Rock.  Never truer.

I've had  a lot of new vehicles. Always bought brand new. This was my first &quot;2nd hand&quot; vehicle, and I have been in love with this for 6 years!

What a friend!  The Vortec engine is indestructible. I have driven it with a small 11' &quot;Terry&quot; camping trailer up 10% to ll% grades in both Oregon and Arizona, and it acts like nothing is on the behind!  I don't know of many cars (yes I'm still a teenager) that can beat me at the light, and I SURELY don't know of anybody that can beat me up some of the 1-2 mile elevation changes (2,000 feet to 5,000 feet) I drive with on most weekends.

I LOVE THIS VEHICLE.  I must now find a new vehicle since I've put a HARD 150,000 miles on this lovely friend. So, if I change ANYTHING it will be ONLY for something that is just 6&quot; longer (so I can sleep in it more comfortably) and just 6&quot; wider (so can have a camping sweety who doesn't get claustrophobia between the wheel wells and me)!

TRUST ME, if you can possibly get a used Chevrolet S-10 Blazer for the prices that this site is showing...........DO IT!
