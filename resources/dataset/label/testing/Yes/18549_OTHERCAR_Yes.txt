            I owned my '88 Ciera for about 2 years and it's served me very well...especially considering I got it for $900!

The engine isn't all that powerful (2.5L 4-cylinder, 98hp), but it does get the job done.  I have no problems keeping up in city driving, but once on the highway, mated with only a 3-speed automatic, is where things become unpleasantly noisy.  I'm usually the only person in this car; if you plan to carry passengers and/or cargo often, look for one with a V6.

The car has been very reliable....the engine hums along without a hitch.  The only repairs required were the alternator, transmission gasket, valve cover gasket, tie rods, and struts.  Other than that, just regular maintenance.

Even with 140,000 miles, it starts up well even in subzero weather.  Bottom line though, results may vary depending on how well maintained the car is, but this one seems to have been well taken care of.

Car has traditional American car ride:  comfy on most roads, somewhat sloppy on bad roads.  It's very roomy up front, not quite as roomy in the back(especially with front seats moved all the way back).  As far as quality goes, it's not a Honda or Toyota, but parts aren't falling off either.

In summary, I would recommend this car to anyone looking for &quot;A to B&quot; basic, reliable transportation.<br><br>
