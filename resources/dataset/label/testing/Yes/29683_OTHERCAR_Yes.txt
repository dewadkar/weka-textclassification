               After having the misfortune of owning the Polaroid Funmax digital "camera" which goes by a few different brand names i have discovered, i was wary of buying another inexpensive digital camera.

   Im glad i took another chance!

   I was in Walmart looking for something to buy with a $100 giftcard i got for my birthday and as i strolled down the electronics isle i happened to see the Aiptek pocket DV. After reading all the cool things it was capable of and seeing it on sale for $59.99 from the original $69.99 i took a chance on another inexpensive digital camera.

   This little camera ( its no larger than a pack of cigarettes ) is capable of taking either over 3 minutes of digital video in avi format or 250 picture of high resolution pictures or ( so the package says ) 2000 lower quality pictures or 30 mintures of audio recording or a little of each before its internal memory is full. And ifs thats not enough, its also a PC/web cam with very good performance and quality! 

   For features it came with two CDs, one the basic installation CD and another CD packed with 8 multimedia programs! On top of the camera it has a 3 digit counter for how many pictures have been taken or how long the video recording is progressing. Unlike the polaroid you dont have to connect it to the computer to erase the last picture taken or all the pictures currently stored in the camera, you just have to press the mode button till you get to the delete icons and then press the shutter button. The camera also came with the cutest little tripod i ever saw, its about 6 inches tall and very sturdy. Also included is a USB cord and even a wrist strap and two AA batteries! You can adjust the lens for close or far shots and the most clever feature is that if you face the camera at you, theres a little square mirror under the lens so you can see if you have the lens pointed in the right place. No more cut off heads like with so many cameras when you try to take a picture of your self and you dont know if you have the camera pointed right!

   In the looks department it is very handsome. Its two toned ( blue and silver ) with cool curves that divides the colors. It deffintly looks more expensive than it really is.

   Now for the few cons. The seams where the two colors meet seem to not always be tight all over and the plastic body feels cheap. The camera has a battery saving auto off feature but its too fast. So if you take a picture and dont take another one within like 40 seconds it shuts off and you have to hold the mode button down for 5 seconds to turn it on then press the shutter button quickly or it shuts down right away. So spontanous picture taking is out with this set up. Theres no flash but that seems to be the norm with inexpensive digital cameras. The shutter button is on top where your thumb most likely wont be when you hold it so you have to press it with your pointer finger and its a little too stiff to press thus making steady picture taking a little differcult. Maybe it was my CD-ROM acting up but i couldn't install the software from the included CD, it kept freezing up my computer. I had to go to the Aiptek website and download the drivers and software. 

   Final word. Its a gooding looking,feature rich, inexpensive digital camera thats worth $59.99 if not more.
