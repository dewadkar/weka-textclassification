              So, you love the styling of the Viper, but you can't afford one?  Well this is the next best thing.  The Avenger comes in three flavors: Base, Sport, and ES.  The base comes with a 2.0L I-4 with your choice of a 5-speed stick, or a 4-speed auto.  The Sport and ES come with the 2.5L SOHC 24-valve V-6.  The I-4 is rated at 140hp &amp; 130ft-lbs, while the V-6 comes in at 163hp with 170 ft-lbs.  About the only bad thing about this car is that Dodge had decided to drop them in favor of the 2001 Stratus Coupe.  For now though, the Avenger is a great car which definitely deserves a second look.<br><br>
