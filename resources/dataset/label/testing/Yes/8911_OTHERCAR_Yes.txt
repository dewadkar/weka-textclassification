            Warning: this review will contain no incredibly technical automotive information. It is geared strictly to non-car people looking to make decisions about leasing and purchasing. If that sounds like you...please proceed!

That said, I have to confess that I don't particularly like cars. To me, they're a means to an end, never an end in themselves. If they get me to where I'm going, I like them. If they're comfortable I like them a little more. And if they're safe and in some way practical, they score top marks.

For the most part, my 1999 Dodge Caravan (a silver-green color) fits that bill.

Here are the key features on this vehicle, as I see them:

1) It has sliding doors on both sides. This is key to me. Our last Dodge Caravan (a 1997 model that gave us NOTHING BUT TROUBLE) had only a passenger side sliding door, which we found impractical with two children and a dog. There was a lot of climbing over one another and a lot of pushing. With two sides we avoid that rough housing. It's also practical when we park alongside a wall or building. In other words, there's always a "side" available for disembarking.

2) The car seats 7 comfortably. The configuration is two people in the front (driver and passenger); two people in the middle, and 3 people in the rear. Each seat is surprisingly roomy. The passenger on the passenger side in the middle is treated to excellent leg room, as is the passenger who sits in the far right in the rear. The other passengers have adequate leg room.

3) Our car has automatic windows, which I find practical, since I can open and shut the passenger and small rear windows while I'm driving. Since my other passengers are usually small children--who I don't want touching the windows--this is essential.

4) The car has great "extra" space. The area between the driver and the front passenger is equipped with a rope basket, which we use for maps and snacks. The area under the front passenger seat has a roomy drawer. The area beside the passenger side sliding door is a great place to put a bicycle, an extra suitcase, or an 80-pound labrador retriever. The area behind the rear seat is also ideal for packing.

5) The driver seat adjusts manually, using a lever. I find this perfectly adequate.

6) Both outside rear view mirrors adjust automatically with levers inside the car. I love this feature, since you don't have to hang out the window to get a perfect adjustment. The inside rear view mirror is manual.

7) There's a cup holder for every passenger in the car. And we use each and every one of them. 

Safety features in the vehicle include driver and passenger side air bags; front wheel drive; and anti-lock breaks.

So, how does the Dodge Caravan drive? Well, I'm no automotive expert (as I've mentioned...)But in the two years we've had our Caravan I've been totally satisfied with the drive. It drives smoothly. It takes hills without feeling like it's slowing down or losing steam. It speeds up nicely on the highway, without tugging. 

The brakes on the Caravan feel a little "soft" but they do a fine job. It took me a while to get used to the amount of pressure you have to exert to come to a full stop. But once accustomed to them I've had no problem. And the few times I've had to come to a sudden stop, they've done the job.

In my opinion, the Caravan is surprisingly easy to steer for a vehicle it's size. I've had no trouble maneuvering it in and out of traffic, parking lots, or other small spaces. Even parking it hasn't been a problem. The steering is smooth and accurate.

How about repairs?

Thanks to my husband, we're pretty good at following the routine maintenance schedule. So besides the regular oil changes, etc., we haven't had any major repairs. We did have a problem early on with one tire, but it was under warranty and quickly replaced. After 2 years we have about 30,000 miles on the vehicle. 

Other features:

The dash board is fairly utilitarian, with buttons for the defrost and air conditioner, and a sliding lever for temperature settings. We have a cassette player but no CD player. Our windshield wipers have 3 settings. And we have a rear window windshield wiper, which runs at one speed, or on an intermittent setting. The defrost works effectively (we live in a cold snowy climate, so I've had plenty of opportunity to test this out). The heat also works well and comes on quickly. The air conditioning also works well, though passengers in the rear seats cool off last. And by the time they do, front seat passengers are shivering.

The quality of the stereo is adequate. My guess is that anyone who needs better sound in their car will purchase a CD player.

So what are the negatives:
1) I think the doors slide a little too quickly--not giving small fingers enough time to get out of the way. This can be a particular hazard when you park on a hill. Though they do lock into the "open" position, doors slam closed when released.

2)The air conditioning takes a long time to reach the rear and it's difficult to regulate.

3) The gas gage seems inaccurate to me. It stays on the "full" setting for a long time and then drops rapidly, which is deceptive.

4) Let's face it...it's a mini van. So if you don't want "mini van" status, don't do it!

What's the bottom line:

It's a reliable car that comfortably and safely fits your children, their friends, your dog and your gear. It gets you where you want to go reliably. And frankly, that's all I care about.
