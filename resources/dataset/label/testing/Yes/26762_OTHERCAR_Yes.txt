            I bought the 360L about a year ago after checking out online reviews, such as those on CNET.com.  The camera is very affordable, yet its low price doesn't affect its quality.  I've used this camera for everything from taking pictures on fishing trips, hikes, to trade shows, construction sites, parties, weddings, and the like.  The quality of the pictures amazed me.  It doesn't do really close up shots too well, nor very far shots.  But for your average every-day use, the picture quality is excellent.

There are two minor issues with the product though.  First the size of the camera makes it so its not the most convenient thing to carry around.  If they could make this camera fit in my pocket, that would be great!  The other issue is the downloading time.  It takes me about 20-30 minutes to load and save pictures from the smartcard (if I have about 30 pics)  I'd prefer something faster, but again for the price, its hard to beat.

So if you're a first time digicam buyer, not looking for the highest resolution, looking for something affordable and reliable, the 360L is probably your best bet.
