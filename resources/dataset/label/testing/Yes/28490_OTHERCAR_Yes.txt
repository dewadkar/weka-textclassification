            If you are looking for one of the nicest, classiest SUVs on the road today, then you must test drive the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Available in the Laredo or Limited trim, both trim levels offer all the amenities that one could need, and then some.  And if you are wondering what kind of engine to choose........don't panic.  The V8 of course offers much more horsepower and pep, but the 4.0 H.O. 6 offers generous horsepower and has just enough pep to keep you very satisfied.  

The exterior of the Jeep is very nice.  It's well rounded features add to the maneuverability of this vehicle.  Jeep offers some of the most beautiful color schemes to compliment your vehicle.  My Jeep is very wonderful.  I opted for the Patriot Blue exterior, which is one of the most brilliant blues I've ever seen.  And the interior is just as nice as the exterior, especially if you go for the uplevel Limited trim.  Soft, supple leather surrounds you, and the seating areas are so comfortable that you could swear you were setting on the nicest leather sofa money could buy!  

I honestly don't know of any refinements that Jeep could make in their amenities.  The exterior is exotic and refreshing, the interior is nice and cozy.  The only thing they could change is to make it a little larger.  The rear seating area doesn't occupy 3 adults comfortably, but 2 fits very well, and are very comfortable.  The rear cargo area is very generous, as Jeep has its full size spare tire located under the floor of the cargo bay.  The rear seats can also be lowered to add more cargo space.  

All Jeeps come factory loaded with virtually every option available.  All you have to choose is your trim level, Laredo or Limited, and choose extra options such as CD player, Power Moonroof, and your choice of 4WD systems (Selec-Trac, Quadra-Trac II, or Quadra-Drive.  And if you want to customize your Jeep, well it doesn't stop here.  You can add side-impact Air Bags, Power adjustable pedals, an array of suspension packages, Tire Pressure Monitoring System, 10 way power-adjustable heated seats, and much, much more.  It's almost unreal what you can put on your Jeep.

All the 4WD systems are excellent.  I have the Quadra-Drive 4WD system on my Jeep, and it is very excellent.  It's shift-on-demand feature is excellent, convenient, and easy.  But, any of Jeep's 3 available 4WD systems are excellent.  I owned a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo with Selec-Trac, and it was wonderful.  Talk about playing in the snow and mud, I had a ball with it!!

So, if you are looking to buy a SUV, and you want the classiest, nicest, appealing, comfortable, dependable, and rugged SUV around, you need to test drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee today!  No other dealer can offer you all the options that you can get on your Jeep, and none offers customization like the good folks at Jeep.  So, see a dealer today, and you definitely won't regret it!
