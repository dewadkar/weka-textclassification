            The Galant is a great deal.  It is as roomy as a Camry (the roomiest) and almost as reliable.   It is also the cheapest in its class for a given configuration.  Sure the Camry may have a higher residual value at resale but the Galant is so much cheaper and Mitsubishi often has incredibly cheap financing (I had 1.5%)

I have also returned to my dealer because the sales pitch is intelligent; when they see you are saavy, they don't bludgeon you with the psychological warfare techniques aka Toyota.  Finally, the service is EXCELLENT:  repairs/servicing ON TIME, well-communicated, reasonable and handled with polite professionalism.

I won't compare as that is best done by professionals but I did check out the others.  The Camry is a fine car but it really was only a tad more refined than the Galant and no bigger; not enough to justify a $4000 price differential; it is also more likely to be stolen than a Galant.  I was also royally annoyed by the Toyota sales techniques and yet they continued their spiel even I clearly indicated I was no fool to their methods; IT'S VERY OFF-PUTTING, Toyota.

The Honda Accord felt small and expensive and no more refined.

The Nissan Altima was zippy but clunkly-looking and smaller.

The Mazda 626 was plasticky and tinny and rough at the edges.

There is another reason to buy a Galant; it's the underdog.<br><br>
