            We wanted a full size conversion van mostly for comfort during long trips with the family.  My oldest son is over 6'2&quot; tall, and our Astro van, just couldn't fit him anymore.  We needed more room.  We have really enjoyed our van.  It's a 1997 model.  We had some minor problems with the van, but the dealer took care of them in a professional manor.  We are very pleased with the service we've received from the dealer and the van itself.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Ram Van.  We really love ours.  As I said earlier, we bought it mostly for long trips, but I use it's space on a daily basis.  When I have to wait for my kids somewhere, I can nap, relax and read, or watch television in the van.  It's makes my waiting for them so much nicer.  If there is a downside, it's also what we like the most about it......it's big and can be difficult to maneuver.  It also loves gasoline and only gets about 13 miles to the gallon.  <br><br>
