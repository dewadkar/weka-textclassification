            When I bought this car in 98 I knew I made a good choice. From the first test drive till now this car has performed more than I expected. The motor is a 350 5.7 litre V8. The speed and acceleration are great. My car will run the quarter mile in about 13 seconds on a good light. The top end speed I havnt really had a chance to test out but i hit 130 easily going down I-95. The handling in this car is also great. I have taken numerous turns at high speeds and the car performed great. The only real drawbacks of this car is the way it burns gas. It does take down some gas depending on how you drive it. But you expect that when you have that big of a motor under the hood. Other than that this car is worth the money that I spent on it.<br><br>
