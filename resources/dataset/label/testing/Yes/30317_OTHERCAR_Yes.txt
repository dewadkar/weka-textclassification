            After hours of going through sales ads, trying out cameras in stores, and hours of research on the Internet, my husband and I finally decided on this camera. Reasons? 

1) It's lightweight 
2) The digital zoom only kicks in after a long pause (if you have it activated) 
3) The whitebalance feature and 
4) The reasonable price. 

Before it was shipped, we were still a little worried about how much we'd actually like this camera. I must say that it has "wowed" us so far. The whitebalance is excellent, the picture quality is far better than our previous digital camera, it's easy on the lithium batteries, even with the LCD on (but very poor with regular alkalines), and it's very easy to tote around. Don't worry about the plastic casing -- it doesn't feel "cheap". The LCD swivel makes it easy to take self-portraits (if you really wanted to) or if you take pictures from a tripod pointing straight down (like -- for auction posting), you don't have to stand on a chair to see what it looks like before you take the picture! Although this camera is "only" 2 Megapixels, it still produces good pictures, and it great for web use. Great camera, great price.
