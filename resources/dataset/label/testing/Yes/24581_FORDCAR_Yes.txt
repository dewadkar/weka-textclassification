            I have owned a '96 Ford Contour LX V6 since March of 1999. The car has been completely reliable and never gave me any trouble except one time I had ran down the battery (my fault). 

The Contour is probably one of the sportiest compact sedans you can buy. In fact, it's used for racing in Europe (where it's known as the Mondeo), esp. the British Touring Car Championships. The Contour SE has been called &quot;Poor man's BMW 3-series&quot;, with comparable performance at about $20K. My LX trim (a step below SE) Contour has the V6 2.5L Duratec engine, which outputs 170 hp, naturally aspirated. The four-wheel disc brakes provides good stopping power. 

During everyday city driving, you probably won't ever go above 3500 RPM, as the Duratec V6 engine provides a LOT of torque at the low end. Yet if you need a jackrabbit takeoff, or emergency power, the engine's redline is all the way up at 6750 RPM, and you can rev the engine hard when you need to for that extra passing power. Even with automatic transmission, this car is never dull. The mileage is decent, 28 mpg on highways, and over 20 in city. 

Handling is normal with the &quot;sports&quot; suspension package. My car, purchased used, did not have the optional 15-in alloy wheel upgrade. The Michelin MX4 tires provides good grip, even in the rain, though it's possible to spin the wheel if the ground is very wet and you're too hard on the throttle. 

There's a few flaws, of course. The cup holder is horrendous, as it can only hold a single size of cups, and it looks so flimsy and cheesy you'd be afraid to use it. The rear seat is a bit crampy. My car's fuel door release doesn't always work, though a visit to the dealer fixed that. The engine compartment is VERY cramped, and it's just about impossible to find the transmission dipstick (it's UNDER some hoses). 

All in all, I am very happy with my car. Too bad that Ford is discontinuing the Contour (2001 will be its final season). The smaller Focus will not have a V6 option (only the 4-cyl Zetec 2.0 engine, maybe turbo later).  If you are looking for a car that can carry enough people yet sportier and smaller than a &quot;family sedan&quot; like Taurus, Contour should be on your list to check out.
