               The 2000 Mercedes Benz Kompressor is a great luxury car. It has great acceleration, and can turn on a dime. This Benz has a 2,295-cc DOHC 16-valve inline-4, cast-iron cylinder block, alloy head engine, 185 horses ME 2.1 sequential mutipoint fuel ingection system and ignition with antiknock control. The Mercedes has a driver-adaptive, electronic 5-speed automatic transmission. Driver-selectable winter mode starts vehicle moving in 2nd gear or a special second reverse gear to help improve takeoff on slippery surfaces. A feature called the Automatic Slip Control (ASR) senses a wheel or wheels slipping and then automatically brakes those wheels or reduces engine power until traction is restored. 
     The Mercedes Benz Kompressor with many other special features such as ESP, but for me the most impressive part of this car is the interior. Leather seats, compact cup holders paded stearing wheel all make for a comfortable trip anytime of the day. Complete with wooden panneling the designers at Mercedes Benz in Germany left nothing out of consideration of your comfortness. 
     They also left nothing out of consideration for your safty. The first and most important safty devise are the seatbelts.They are 3-point  seat belts with height-adjustable straps in the front. The shoulder belts and lower points attached to seat frames for added safty. Next are the airbags. Airbags are positioned in the front for the driver and front passenger. The mercedes also has airbags in the sides. The Baby Smart system automatically dismantals the front passenger's airbag when a Baby Smart compatable child seat is proporly installed in the front seat. 
     All these features are great, but what I like best about the Mercedes Benz C-230 Kompressor is the driving experience. First you push the gas pedel and with a touch you take off, you think your going 35 but your really going 45 because the ride is so smooth. Then you hit a nice country road, so you start to go faster its a challenging course with many hairpin turns but they are no trouble in this God of cars. Then you decide you love this car so much that you won't stop driving 'til you get to Mexico. This has always been my driving fantasy, and I would dream about it every night then i bought this great car and I live this dream everyday. Well except for the Mexico part. I guarantee you that if you take this car for a test drive you will fall in love with it just as much as I have. 

  The information in this review I found at www.Mercedesbenz.com you can find much more information there and also by my own driving experience.
