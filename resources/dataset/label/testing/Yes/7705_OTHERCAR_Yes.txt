            I have a '99 2-dr Chevy Tahoe (Sport) and I love it.  The leather seats are very comfortable, which makes it perfect for those long drives.  It handles really well in everyday conditions and the push-button 4 wheel drive works adequately.  I can go 80 MPH on the interstate and the ride is still smooth.  You have to push down on the brakes harder than some SUV's, but it's heavier so you can't expect it to stop like a sports car (although it stops fairly well if you push it hard enough).  Another good feature about the 2-dr Tahoe is its turning radius.  I do not remember the exact number, but it is very easy to maneuver in parking lots and most u-turns.  My Chevy Tahoe came with plenty of options to satisfy me, including:
-Sport Package
-5.7(350) V8 MFI
-255 HP, 335 Ibs. of torque  (5,500 Ib. towing capacity)
-3.73 gear ratio
-Towing Package
-Power Leather Seats
-CD player w/ Tape Deck and Radio
-multiple cup holders
-a flip-down sunglasses holder
-many more
The only thing I can think of that is not perfect about this vehicle is its gas mileage (obviously).  Even though it gets approximately 12 MPG in the city and 16/17 MPG on the highway, it still lasts me a good 10 days before I have to fill up.  The 2-dr Chevy Tahoes have been proven to last for multiple years and is relatively cheap to maintain if properly taken care of by its owner/owners.  Looking for a good, dependable used SUV?  Keep the 2-dr Chevy Tahoe in mind.
