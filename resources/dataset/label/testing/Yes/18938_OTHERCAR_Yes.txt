            I bought my first Mitsu the Fall of 2000, a 2001 Galant.  For the buck, I couldn't find a better car.  It looked great, ran great, had good reviews and was a lot cheaper than a Toyota or Honda of the same size.

The car has been trouble free.  The only problem we've had is the front right speaker rattled.  Returned to dealer once for them to check it out and they really didn't do anything, so we just tuned it down a bit.  Still has great sound.

Ride comfort is pretty good for a car this size.  Gas mileage is also what I consider to be very good.  Best mileage on a road trip was 30+, but is now averaging about 27 or 28 miles per gallon.

The only small problem we've had is the CD player.  It gets hot and will start to skip if played for extended periods of time.  A trip back home for us is about 7.5 hours.  We quickly learned that the CD cannot be played for the entire trip.  Small problem though that doesn't really affect the car or our opinion of it.

Interior room and look is very nice.  Although a lot of plastic is used, it's used in a way that doesn't look bad.

My son calls the truck a 2 body truck, big enough to hold whatever you need.  

This is a very solid car for the price.  If you're looking for a nice ride that hey, looks pretty good even if it does somewhat resemble the BMW, this is the car for you.
