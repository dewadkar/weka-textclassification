            I'm the happy owner of a 92 Cadillac DeVille. This is one of the best cars I have owned. It is fast and has good handling for its age and all of my friends like it. It has about 72,000 miles on it and still runs like it was new. The car was my mom's and she gave it to me for my 16th birthday( due to here getting a 99 Deville Concourse). It is very reliable, even though it doesn't have a northstar, the 4.9L is very powerful. It is truly a joy to drive and is faster than any Town Car that I have passed. Though I'm not to pleased to find out that it has a speed lock of 107MPH. This is a car that looks cool when driving to school and looks at place when parked in front of the local stake house.
