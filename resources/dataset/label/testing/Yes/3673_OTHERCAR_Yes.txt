            I wanted a &#147credit card&#148 camera like the 3 MP Minolta Dimage Xt, which was shown to me by a friend at a party.  I was very impressed by its James Bond &#145 Mr. Q&#146 size and attractive casing. Nevertheless I was dissuaded from buying it because of an Internet review.  The reviewer felt that the picture quality wasn&#146t good enough to take on that once in a lifetime trip to Europe.  Furthermore the flash was a bit under powered.  The obvious answer was to go a larger size camera.  But I still wanted a camera that I could carry in any shirt or pant pocket, not one the size of say, a Kodak 6340.  The Cannon S400 was a good candidate, but was expensive and lacked some features of the larger cameras.  I finally took a chance on the Minolta Dimage G400, buying it off the Internet.  Several days later the UPS gal delivered the package.  Inside, carefully packed, was this perfect looking little camera with all the accessories.  It has a nice steel casing, feels solid and looks neat.  It came with two CDs: the Adobe pdf instructions and a Viewer program.  There are a lot of features, some quite advanced. The regular operation is straightforward and reasonably intuitive. But if you want to use the advanced settings (and I do) you have to treat the instruction manual like you were taking an adult night course.  There seems to be no end to the features and manual overrides.  I also bought a drop proof carrying case at Best Buy for $6.99 (a Targus) to protect the camera when putting it under the driver&#146s seat or in my luggage.  The G400 itself is still small.  When I carry it in my pocket I forget it&#146s there.

It takes great pictures.  Took some great shots of the beautiful impatience flowers and oak trees lining the streets of Naples. (Florida &#150 Europe will be next). The flash is quite adequate; it can be increased or decreased.  And too, by setting the manual controls for aperture, ambient light source, exposure compensation, and ISO, or even shutter speed, I can take great pictures in almost any light conditions without a flash. It makes you think of night goggles. But in a really dim room you need a tripod. You can get the F-stop and shutter speed read-outs before you shoot by pressing the shutter half way.  You can also use spot metering to make sure your subject is aptly exposed to take those shots with scenery in the center and person on the side. The battery lasts long enough for most outings and charges in little over an hour. Another feature I like so appropriate for a digital camera is the Auto Bracket function where the camera takes 3 continuous photos on one click with either varying focus (or exposure).  You choose the best of the 3, discarding the rest.  And too you can control sharpness and contrast.  Another thing: The shutter button is all by itself on top. When you ask somebody to take your picture they have no trouble finding and using it.
