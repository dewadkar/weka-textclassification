            I couldn't put any cons above, because minor glitches I had with this car are probably this particular car's problems, not the model problems. Many people try to put their minor problems in cons, but everybody should understand that minor problems occur once in a while with ANY car, simply because each car is different. There is always a matter of lottery luck when you buy a car, a house, or get married :), even if you have done your homework and did a lot of research.

I LOVE this car. I liked it when I saw it first, I like the ride, I like the gas/mileage, I like the looks, seats, electronic features, great surround sound stereo (I am listening to classics all the time).
I exploit this car mercilessly, and haven't had any big problems. I drove Ford Taurus, and had a chance to compare the cars' acceleration and breaking performance - Malibu won 2-0, in my opinion

Ride: Smooth ride, car picks up speed very smoothly, you can't feel the gear switching.
Steering: No loose turns in the steering wheel. 
Electronics: All the electronics buttons are positioned comfortably.

Engine: As for "avoid-this-car-because-of-the-engine-problems" people, I have done a big research before I bought the car, and found out that Camry (the closest match technically and price-wise) has much more problems with the engine than Malibu, and Malibu engine and transmission have been known as one of the most reliable ones among Chevy cars. I asked several auto-mechanics about this, and they confirmed this idea.

Room: I somewhat agree with people who say it's not the roomiest car in the rear. But I wasn't looking for a roomy car, so can't help you here. I doubt I had any people sitting in the rear more than 5 times since I bought it. However, I don't have any room problems in the front, and I am quite a big person, as well as my 6'3" boyfriend, who happens to rent different cars all the time, and always pays special attention to leg room in the car - he liked my car.

Other features: Seats are very comfortable. Feels like you are sitting quite high, and I like this. Tilt steering wheel is helpful, and, as I said before, it is a part of standard package, as well as cruise control and power locks.

Safety: Latest car-wrecking tests show this is the 4th car in safety in passenger medium size car category. Could be better, I agree. Safety belts are working properly, though.

Trunk: The trunk is HUGE. I was really impressed. It looks compact on the outside, but wait till you open it.
I moved from MD to GA in this car, and put half of my apartment in it. Back seats are folding, creating even more room for oversized objects. I did a trade show once, and put  the whole showcase in my car, including two large mannequins, lighting, stairs, racks, items, etc...

Price: I think I personally overpaid a little bit, but you will agree, I am sure, it is not a car problem, I just wasn't patient enough to shop around. Keep in mind that I bought it in April 2000 NEW (there was 15 miles on it) and in Maryland/DC, which is quite an expensive place to live. In general, you can find better deals on this car, and don't be lazy - shop around.

Oh, maybe it is not that important, but everybody who rode in the rear, said they loved that back seats are slightly higher than front seats - this allows back passengers to see the road better through the wind shield.


The problems I had:
1. one of the rear speakers had bad wire contact and created funny noises - but I think everyone would agree, this is not big deal.
2. after running my car MANY TIMES on very low level of gas (my bad), and making several long distance trips one shortly after another, I had a fuel pump failure. The fuel pump was replaced next day (because I broke at night) at the local Chevy dealership with no hassle whatsoever.

*For your information, customer service was great. I got stuck in the middle of the road in the evening, in strange city, on the interstate, was towed away within 40 minutes and dropped off at the local Chevy dealership. I was never put on hold over the phone, my problem was taken care of immediately, and customer service called me back several times to make sure I am ok.

Overall, I am VERY satisfied with the car.
