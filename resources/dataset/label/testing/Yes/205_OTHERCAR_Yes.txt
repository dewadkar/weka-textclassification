            A few weeks ago I was sitting at a stop sign with one of my relatives. This relative of mine rear ended another suv. We were going about 7 miles per hour When we hit the other suv. After the accident I got out of the car and noticed that the bumper on the front was touching the front tire, the hood was bent up like a v, The cap on the radiator fluid was broken off, and every other feature on the front(including the grill!)was demolished. The worst part about this low speed accident is that the cost to repair the damage was over $3,000.<br><br>
