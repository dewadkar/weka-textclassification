<TEXT>
            I've owned this vehicle from 1998 to May 2000. I can say that I bought it on a whim after I test drove a friend's Miata. It was just so much fun.

The model I bought had the popular equipment package, e.g. some power functions and style upgrades (leather wrapped steering wheel, etc.), but was otherwise the base model. 1997 was the last model year for the 1st generation body style.

Before I start the review, please repeat after me:

<i> The Miata is not a practical car, it's practically a car !</i>

And:

<i> There is no reason why somebody needs a Miata. </i>

But there are so many reason to want one ! Some buy it for looks, but that has never interested me much. Some say that it is a woman's car, but I think you can find Miata buyers on both sides of the gender divide.

Since I stated above that nobody really needs a Miata, let me find some excuses:

a) Do questions like 'What about a cold air intake ?', 'Is 10 degrees BTDC really the best engine timing ?' or 'Do steel brake lines make a difference ?' keep you awake at night ? This is the car for you. A myriad of enthusiasts have documented almost every aspect of this vehicle, and you can find parts for almost any project you can think of.

b) You want a small and reliable roadster on a budget. This also applies to enthusiasts of Italian or English roadster owners who yearn for a more reliable vehicle.

c) You feel removed from the driving experience and want to get back to the roots.

d) You refer to automatic transmissions as 'slushboxes'.

You shouldn't buy it if:

a) You want to impress the neighbors.
b) You live in Northern Michigan.
c) You don't know how to drive a stick.
d) You have a wife/husband who is less than understanding.
e) You need to travel long distances and this is your only car.
f) You need to burn that Mustang at the traffic light.

But let me come back to my own experience. 

<b> Exterior / Interior </b>
The design of the Miata is somewhat dated. Both the exterior and the interior design originate in the late eighties, and it shows. 
The interior takes its cues from classic roadsters and it is far from luxurious. But it does provide a very nice retro feel. Some of the controls (power mirrors, cruise control) were placed in the most absurd locations. 
The seats provide ample support, but I was not comfortable during long rides. Some people might also feel cramped in the Miata.

<b>Engine</b>
If you love a classic 4-cyl. engine, you'll like the Miata. The engine is reliable, goes through its rpm range with easy, but is not as sophisticated as some of the Miata's competitors. The exhaust note is great though, you'll never want to turn on the stereo. 
The Miata is also not a very fast car. The 1.6L engine was definitely not build for a fast quarter mile. But it is very easy to modify, as it is well documented. I got an average of 27mpg, which is not all that great for a vehicle of this size and weight.

<b>Handling and Suspension</b>
The handling is harsh, but it really lets you enjoy the road. The car is well balanced and can turn 'on a dime'. It almost feels like you're driving a bumper car. With all the feedback from the road and the engine, you're constantly under the impression of going faster than you really are. It was this fun factor that made me buy the car.

<b>Quality</b>
The car uses time proven components and isn't very fancy in its design. Mine had absolutely zero defects and required no repairs at all.

<b>Maintenance</b>
This car is exceptionally well documented, so I decided to service it myself. Some parts (oil filter) are hard to reach, but servicing this vehicle isn't rocket science.

<b>Convertible Top</b>
The Miata has a manual top that requires the unzipping of the rear (plastic) window. One has to get used to this process at first, but it can be done rather quickly. The convertible top didn't show any signs of wear during the two years of ownership.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I don't think I had a car that I ever felt so attached to. I wouldn't want it as a daily driver, but I remember taking long detours on my way home from work to seek out a windy and scenic route.
I currently own a Z3, one of the Miata's competitors. Maybe I'm getting old, but if it wasn't for ride comfort, I would have bought another Miata.
