            The vehicle I am reviewing is a 2002 Flame Red base model Neon with the 135hp 2.0 liter engine and manual transmission.  Price, as tested: 10,500.00 out the door.

It may be only a base model, and it may not be that fast, but it's red and it's mine.  

I bought my 2002 Neon a few weeks ago.  Over the last 2000 miles I've really come to appreciate this great little car.  I know that Dodge has had this model for a while and that means they have had plenty of opportunity to work the bugs out.  I feel they have done a pretty good job with the Neon.

Fit and Finish:

Overall, this car has a fit and finish you wouldn't expect in a sub 15,000 vehicle.  My first impression is of a quiet and solid car, especially for a compact.  I had driven the Ford Focus and, honestly, the Neon seemed more solid and refined. The body panels fit really well, the engine compartment is laid out well, and the interior is neat and well designed.

Interior:

I really like the seating position in this car.  The instruments are easy to read and well laid out.  I was surprised by the sound system.  The quality is very good, especially the base response.  I can feel my chest shaking on the heavier base parts of a song.  I have access to very high quality stereo components on the cheap (no, I'm not a criminal) and I don't see replacing the stereo in this car. 

Visibility is pretty good for a small car.  Some of the pillars do get in the way but, it isn't as bad as some other cars on the road.

Exterior:

I really like the body style on this car.  Dodge has really evolved the Neon without losing sight of it's essential nature.  I added an optional spoiler (call me vain) and it really cleaned up the rear of the car. The paint is beautiful, with no orange peel or mismatch.

Engine:

This car is seriously under appreciated for it's motor. While 135 horsepower doesn't sound like much, it is more than fine for the Neon.  In 2001, Dodge redesigned both the intake and exhaust system for this car, making aftermarket mods almost unnecessary.  In prior years, people had to resort to aftermarket exhaust sytems to clean up the restrictive resonator and muffler on this car.  Dodge changed this with the installation of the European high flow exhaust system.  I see no reason to spend money unless you want a noisy car.  

Dodge also addressed the problems in the earlier intake system.  The earlier model routed the air over the hot engine, warming the intake air and robbing power.  This was fixed by the installation of a cool air intake system, which made significant increase in power for the motor.
In the 2002 model, the intake system is kept away from the engine heat so you only need to do one thing to open this engine up. Just remove the top of the airbox and install a higher flow filter from K&N.  Your Neon will wake up, making you swear it makes about 150hp now.  The only price you may pay is higher intake honk and slightly lower gas mileage.

Gas Mileage -- speaking of...

I have been getting above 30mpg from this car since it was new, with a high of 35.7 on a long highway trip.  I have been very satisfied with the mileage so far, and expect it to continue to improve as the engine breaks in.

Driving:

I like driving this car. It is just the right combination of nimbleness and power.  Road noise is reasonable, the suspension works well for a small car, and it is enjoyable to drive on the freeway.  

Summary:

I know this review sounds pretty glowing and, no car is perfect.  The Neon could use a little more power in the base model, the engine does have to work a bit at higher speeds, and it does sit a little high in it's suspension, which contributes to a little body roll.  However, all these things are pretty minor, none of them glaring enough to detract from the positive aspects of the car.

Overall I would recommend this as a economy car.  For the price I really didn't find any other comparable cars on the market.  The Kia was too cheap and bouncy, the Hyundai too boring, the Ford Focus not refined enough, and the Echo too expensive.  Finally, it isn't a Honda.  Though I have owned and loved four Hondas, I just didn't want to own yet another kids car, which is also the most stolen car in the country.

So, the Neon is for me.  I never thought I'd ever buy Mopar but, I think I'll be really pleased with this car for a long time.
