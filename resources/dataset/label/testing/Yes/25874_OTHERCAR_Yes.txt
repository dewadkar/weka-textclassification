            I leased my 2000 Cherokee Limited last February I loved the truck when I drove it off the lot and the love affair is still burning strong in my heart...I don't know what I am going to do when my lease is up and I have to turn the truck back in to Chrysler Financial...Ahhh who am I kidding I'll get another one just like it!!

I ordered my Cherokee from the factory so it came in with every option that you can stack onto a Cherokee.  Infinity sound system with cd/tape player, Up-county suspension, fog lights, trailer hitch, heated leather seats etc. it really has all the luxury options that you would expect to find only available in the Cherokee's big brother the Grand Cherokee.  The list price came to just under 29,000 dollars when all totaled up but the lease on the car is unbelievably inexpensive.

I have put about 15,000 miles on the car in the 10 months that I have owned it and they have been a pleasure to drive.  The ride is a little on the bumpy side (this is a SUV folks) but it is more than managable.  The power comes on strong when you push the gas making merging into traffic a not so scary situation and the 4X4 system (select-trac comes standard on the limited) is second to none in the market.

I have used the vehicle both on and off road.  I use it as my primary source of transportation but do get a chance to use it off-road at least once a year when I attend the Jeep Jamboree which is a gathering of Jeep owners from around the country for a weekend of off-roading and mud bogging that really lets you see that the Jeep is the standard and everyone else is trying to stay on their heels.

I highly recommend the Jeep Cherokee as a source of transportation and entertainment in a very inexpensive package.
