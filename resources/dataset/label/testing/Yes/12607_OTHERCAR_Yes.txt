            I decided to trade up from my Sony Mavica some time ago, and settled on buying one from Canon, after looking at Sony, Kodak and Nikon digital Cameras.

I settled on the Canon S10 because I liked the compact size and the fact that the Compact Flash slot can accomodate not only compact flash cards, but the IBM Microdrive.

If you are a photographer who uses a 35-mm camera and wants a lightweight, 2.1-megapixel digital camera that can store more than 1,000 images for general business or personal use, the Canon PowerShot S10 is a leading contender. The S10 captures and stores high-resolution images on CompactFlash Type I and II cards, including the IBM 340MB microdrive, which stores over 1,000 lower-resolution images. The camera's playback function includes a powerful slide show feature for displaying up to 100 images at 3- to 30-second intervals, which is great for viewing images on a TV screen.

The S10's menus are in five languages--English, German, French, Spanish, and Japanese. Both text and icons identify button and dial controls. 

For composing shots with the S10, you can use its 2X optical zoom with wide-angle to telephoto range, enhanced with 2X or 4X digital zoom. Auto mode sets the focus, exposure, and flash for you but works at the highest resolution only in fine compression mode. There is a 10-second self-timer feature, as well as macro and continuous shooting (1.7 images per second) modes.

In manual mode, you can adjust compression, resolution, exposure, and white balance. Image mode is useful for capturing moving subjects, landscapes, night shots, and monochrome images. Stitch mode is for photos you plan to merge horizontally, vertically, or in a matrix with included software.

I found this camera a snap (pun intended) to operate. From start to finish, to uploading pictures, this camera works great. In addition, if you use a Mac, you'll be pleased to know that not only is the software Mac compatible, but it is an excellent piece of Mac software for uploading pictures to your Mac. Also includes Adobe Photodeluxe software.

I'm very happy with this camera.
