            If you are realistic about what you want in an SUV, you already know why you are looking at a Range Rover.  People buy cars that they feel will represent their tastes and opinions (at least most people who buy specialty auto's do).  Those who buy a Range Rover must carefully weigh the aggravation of owning a vehicle in which Mechanics speak proudly of their billable hours on YOUR CAR, versus the prestige of the vehicle. 

On the positive side:  My Range Rover is a foul weather phenomenon... it drives with confidence through just about anything.  I can say this with confidence because my town receives upwards of 400 inches of snow each year.  I have climbed dirt roads in Utah's Uintah range that Jeeps could not scramble.  I describe to friends that my Rover could climb a telephone pole if necessary. I once entered a field and did actually get stuck in 3 ft of snow after crossing more than half a mile into the field.  Two Chevy Blazers attempted to come to my rescue, neither getting  more than fifteen feet into the field before bogging down. I was finally able to be yanked out with an exceptionally long winch cable.  It is amazingly comfortable on long drives, and offers a huge window to the road due to the drivers seat positioning. All Passenger areas are comfortable (or so my family and friends say, I have never ridden in my own back seat)  The looks are distinctive and the amenities are tasteful.

However:  There are few experts on repairing the thing, and the local dealerships service department always seems to use guesswork and elimination to solve issues. The assembly of the vehicle is not designed with accessibility in mind, and items that seemingly should be easily accessible for periodic maintainence are a chore to reach.   The electrical system (switches etc) are fragile and poorly sealed, and a single window or seat switch can set you back a hundred dollars or more.  On the highway, the truck does not offer the quality often awarded to other SUV's...it does NOT drive like a car. With more then 11 inches of travel at each wheel,  the same feature that makes the Range Rover so capable off road makes it floaty and unsure on the highway. Despite Aluminum body panels, the weight of the Range Rover is staggering, and on muddy off cambers I have slid off the road into trees. I am sure that no other SUV compares in the expense of replacing a quarter panel. Forget Luggage, and own a small dog, the Luggage area is seriously lacking (The discovery seems a better option for packing up the family).

If prestige and/or TRUE off road capability are what you have in mind, the Range Rover is a great pick. If you really want a dependable family 4x4, Don't overlook the Landcruiser, or Yukon. I also enjoy the road feel of the Blazer and Durango.  I have spent time in all of these, and feel that they all are capable enough... with out the hefty repair tags. In contrast, I own a Mercedes Gelaendewagen, which I could not in good concience recommend to many people.  Bottom Line? I will buy another Range Rover, but I do so with eyes wide open. Everyone should do the same.<br><br>
