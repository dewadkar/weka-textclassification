            I've had my DSC-P1 for about 3 years now. It was one of the best small cameras on the market when I bought it and it still stands up to many that are out there now if you know how to get the best out of it. It certainly does have it's short-comings too though. I'm going to write this review to suggest workarounds for many of the shortcomings - you can read the other reviews for the other points. 

First, when taking photos in bright light, you can't go wrong. 3.3 Mega pixels is more than most people will ever need. I leave it set to 1600x1200 most of the time, which just about fills up a 32 MB card and flattens the battery with about 48 shots. I have a second 23 MB card and reserve battery so I can quickly swap them. Which brings me to the first and most annoying glitch:-

BATTERY LIFE

A second battery is a VERY GOOD idea since you'll ultimately get longer life out of them if you allow them to fully decharge before charging again - with 2, you won't be tempted to recharge a half-depleted battery. The problem I (and others) are seeing with these batteries are that they refuse to be recharged. They show that they are full, but have no minutes of use left in them. When you attempt to use them, the 'empty battery' icon flashed and they turn themselves off. 

UPDATE: Sony has admitted on their support site that this camera develops a problem with battery charging and life. They offer to upgrade the camera for you for free. I sent mine to their service center... I got it back 1 week later and it's perfect! :) 2x new batteries (send them your old ones), new adapter, new connectors installed in camera, newly designed circuit inside camera. IT WORKS! :) I'm very happy about this. It wasn't under warranty. My faith is restored in Sony!

The next topic I've figure out is

FOCUSING IN POOR LIGHT

This is an easy fix - though it took me the best part of a year to figure it out. When taking a photo in a room (distance 3-12ft or so), simply select the mode with a man stood in front of a mountain. This I assume uses a fixed flash distance which works well for parties etc. The results are 1000 x better than 'auto' mode. Try it!

POOR FLASH

This is still somewhat of a mystery to me. Sometimes the flash lights up a subject and sometimes it fails miserably. I've found that (seriously) making sure my finger isn't partially covering the flash helps! The camera is so small that it's an easy mistake to make. Also, set the flash to high in the options - and it seems to work better with the 'fixed focus' mode I mentioned above. 

Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about the fact that the flash is so far over - it always casts a shadow to the left of your subject. 

SLOW SHUTTER SPEED

This takes some getting used to, but again you can work with it. You'll certainly miss some 'moments' but it you're expecting something fast or funny to happen, you can pre-focus on the subject (or something else about the same distance away) by half pressing down the shutter button. After about 1/2 second, the camera will be ready, and will instantly take the photo when you fully depress the button. I caught motor-sports, and many 'moments' at parties with this technique. With the 'fixed-focus' mode on, you don't even have to focus it at a subject before hand. 

If you can live with these glitches, you'll get some great shots with this camera. It's most redeeming feature is it's size. If it hadn't been digital and in my pocket I wouldn't have taken 90% of the 4000 shots I've already taken. That's half the point of digital - you can throw the duff ones away
so you can be trigger-happy, but you have to have the camera in your pocket at all times! 

My last point - I really like the new DSC-P5. It is far superior (and cheaper) but has slightly less battery life since they're smaller (hey buy three with what you save!)

OK - one more point. Memory sticks rule! Shop around and you'll find 128MB for under $60!
