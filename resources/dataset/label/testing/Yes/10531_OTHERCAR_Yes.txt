            It was Z-day literally.  Stillen recently held it's 300z Day and Performance sale at it's Costa Mesa facility.  Convoys of Z cars from as far ways as Northern California made the trip to join other Z enthusiasts in a day of festivities that included some of the hottest Zs in the country, tours of Stillen's 70,000- square- facility, free food and drinks, autographs from Steve Millen, as well as sales on many of the company's coolest performance items.  Discounts on-the-spotable, as were a variety of contests and awards.  And, as always, the technical advice was free.  If this sounds like something you'd be interested in call Stillen (714/540-9145) for info on the next 300z Day.<br><br>
