                 I bought my Pontiac Sunfire brand new in 1996.  I purchased a Pontiac Sunfire because I felt it was most affordable &quot;sports&quot; car on the market.  I enjoyed the styling of this vehicle and at around $13,000.00 you could not beat the price for a new vehicle.

     Even though I bought this vehicle for the price, I was quite surprised by the quality of the drive and the &quot;pick up&quot; this little four cylinder has in its engine.  This car has no problems driving in the city, on back roads, or on the expressway.  

     The best feature of my 1996 Pontiac Sunfire is the reliability it has had over the last four years.  I haven't brought my Sunfire to the garage for anything other than getting its oil changed or rotating its tires when it was needed.  I would recommend this car to all my friends and any one else in the market for a car.<br><br>
