            The Nissan Altima I've driven is a 95, and from what I've heard they've only gotten better.  Not that they were anything bad to start with.  The drive is very smooth, quiet, and it has a great turn ratio (something that I find very important).  It's not quite roomie enough for me, but I find the seats very comfortable both as a driver and a passenger in the front or rear seats.  It's a breeze to take care of and they are built to last.  This one has been in 4 _bad_ accidents and is still going strong and looking good.  The worst thing about the car is it has the worst cup holder setup I've ever seen in my life -- cheap, plastic, flimsy.  I'm real Super Big Gulp oriented so it fails in that department.  The dash is easy to read in the day and night and I'm pretty happy with the gas mileage.  Who ever though of that silly little flip up trunk lock cover really needs to be killed, but the trunk itself is great plenty of room in all directions to take many off sized boxes.  Overall I'd say the folks over at Nissan have a strong product in the Altima.<br><br>
