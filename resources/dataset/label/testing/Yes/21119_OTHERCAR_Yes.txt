            I finally had to junk my 8 year old Honda Accord last month, not because it broke down, but because I got into a fender bender requiring $3000 worth of repairs.  It served me well over 120,000 miles, never had a major mechanical problem, and even after the accident, the engine was still perfect.  These Honda engines last forever.  But in the end, it wasn't worth a $3000 repair job, so I looked around for a new car.  I came perilously close to getting a Nissan Maxima, but in the end opted for a more sporty model...hence the Audi TT.

I got the 2003 TT with the base 180 hp engine, automatic transmission, Bose stereo, the Homelink system, and 17" wheels.  I would have loved the the 225 hp engine, but there was no automatic transmission model (I can't drive manual).  I would have really loved the 2004 3.2 TT with the 250 hp engine (this one comes with automatic), but they did not have any in stock.  So I saved myself a bunch of money by getting the base engine.  Here are the pros and cons.

Driving Impression:
The 180 hp engine is at best, peppy.  Certainly it's adequate for day to day driving, and it certainly moved the car along better than my 1995 Accord.  Audi engineers have done a good job in sqeezing out as much as they could from this engine, but for sheer power and acceleration, it cannot compare with most of it's competitors out there like the Nissan 350Z or the Infiniti G35 coupe.  Handling is great, due in large part to the 17" wheels.  I have heard that the car rolls somewhat during high speed cornering, but I don't drive it that hard.  For the casually aggressive driver, the handling is fine.

Interior:
Here is the TT's strength.  If there is any such thing as retro, quasi-modern cool, this is it.  Leather quality is good, gauges and dials are clearly visible, and dashboard design is pleasing to the eye.  The rear seats are good only for small kids, dwarves/midgets, and normal sized adults who enjoy crouching into the fetal position.  Trunk space is surprising large.

Ergonomics:
Ironically, as attractive as the interior is to the eye, there are some glaring inconveniences.  The first an foremost is the cup holders.  They are situated way behind the front seats.  In order to actually place a cup into it, you need to twist your body toward the rear of the car, or contort you arm to reach back into the cup holder.  Because it is not in your field of vision, you must either take your eyes off the road to set your cup down, or "feel around" for it with your hands while you are driving.  Incredibly poorly designed, and is borderline retarded actually.  The other gripe I have is the lack of a center armrest or compartment.  I know it's a small car, but these guys are smart and went to engineering school.  They could have figured out something...anything.

Stereo:
The upgraded 180 watt Bose system is, in a word, superb.  Sound clarity is outstanding.  It's hard to imagine such great acoustics inside such a small interior, but they managed it somehow.  In fact, the stereo system may be my favorite feature of the entire car.  The CD reader does not reliably read every brand of burned CD-r disc.  TDK CD's seems to work pretty well.

Exterior:
Exterior design is sleek, streamlined, and somehow manages to look graceful and aggressive at the same time.  The fit and finish is excellent, paint job is great, and the car feel solid.

Overall, the TT is a fun, very drivable, and aesthetically pleasing vehicle.  It's limitations show when it's pushed, but if you want a easy to drive, every day type of sports car, the TT is a good choice.
