             On sunday, the whole family returned to Florida (Orlando) from 
Gatlinburg, TN.  We drove straight through. We found the Nissan Quest
to be quite roomy (compared to the voyager) and extremely comfortable.
The GXE line of the quest (top of the line) gave us 2 air conditioners, and two-way changeable radio/stereo commands.  This minivan provides safety and durability.  It went up mountains without any strain, and 
performed well over ruff roads. Please consider this minivan over the
Chrysler line, we have owned a Voyager and will tell you that their
life-expectancy is 100K.
P.S. while in Gatlinburg, Cades Cove ended up being a bummer.<br><br>
