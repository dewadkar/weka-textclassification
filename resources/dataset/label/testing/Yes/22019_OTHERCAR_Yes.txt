            I do not allocate funds for new car purchases. The upfront depreciation is just too much for me to take. However, I recently bought my first decent used low end luxury car, a 1993 190E with 79k miles. My wife influenced me to do so. I normally buy a car for transportation purposes only. I am mechanically inclined and do not mind tinkering with things, so in buying a used car I accept that some repairs will be forthcoming.   After driving the 190E for more than 5k miles, I am very pleased with its handling, acceleration, suspension and solid transmission shifts.
I have noted other evaluations (in the Kelly Blue Book) that regard the solid transmission shifts as too harsh. There has been some switch issues (I went to the junk yard and picked up 2 electric window switches for a small price) and the air conditioning diverter has needed some work. However other than an oil change all seems to be going well, thus far. 
Of course only time will tell. You can't tell how the day has been until the night arrives and the night has yet to arrive on this 190E.<br><br>
