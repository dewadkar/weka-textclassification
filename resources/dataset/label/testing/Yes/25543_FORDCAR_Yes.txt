            With the vacation season almost upon my family, we found we had a real dilemma on our hands:  Were we going to take our 98 Chevy Cavalier, or our 99 F-150 Supercab? Hmmm... Now there's a real problem for you.

It just so happened that we received Ford's latest company magazine in the mail which described the new F-150 Supercrew, and the upcoming Sport Trac.  After looking at the magazine, and the REAL McCoy, I believe pictures just don't do justice to the new Sport Trac!  So, with curiosity aroused, and vacation time approaching, we held off on buying an F-150 SuperCrew, and traveled to the Kansas City Auto Show on March 8th where a dealer had assured me that a Sport Trac would be on display.  Well, if there's ever been such a thing as &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, this was it!  They had a Mandarin Gold, Black, and Island Blue model sitting there on display.  Now, believe me, these trucks (yes, I call it a TRUCK!!) are so much nicer looking than pictures could ever show!

After scouring the countryside for a dealer who actually HAD one of these vehicles (yes, that was VERY HARD!), we finally found that there were only 2 vehicles in all of NorthEastern Kansas!  Thankfully, we found a beautiful Toreador Red Sport Trac which we immediately purchased.

Since that time, we've had nothing but a wonderful experience with the truck.  I only wish I could say that OTHER folks have had as much fun as we're having - one guy fell off a curb and hit his head on a tree from cranking his head around to watch the truck go by.

The fuel economy has been pretty much inline with what I thought it'd be.  Around 17 mpg city, and 20-21 highway (we've already got 2,700 miles on it now in 1 month).  Handling and acceleration is exceptional for this vehicle, but the BRAKES are rather unusual feeling in a hard braking excercise.  Coming down off-ramps from Interstates, for some reason, it's hard to judge just how fast you're going (I never had that problem in my F-150 for some reason), and I've had to hit the brakes hard - finding them mushy feeling at times.

The biggest (and only REAL complaint) is regarding the tilt-wheel adjustment lever.  That lever and the turn-signal lever are unusually low on the steering column, so that whenever I get into the vehicle, I'm constantly having to remind myself to WATCH OUT for that lever.  It's not a very pleasant feeling jamming your knee into that thing!

Overall tho, this vehicle is one of the finest one's I've ever owned (it's only the 2nd Ford I've ever had), and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!  Only thing you'll find is that you'll be constantly answering questions from strangers about just WHAT this truck is... and how you like it!  But, I'm sure you'll get over that.... <br><br>
