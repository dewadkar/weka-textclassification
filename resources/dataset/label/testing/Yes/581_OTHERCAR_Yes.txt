            We found our 1991 GMC Jimmy at a friends house, it was used and had 75,000 miles on it.  Now I am not one to buy a vehicle with such high miles on it, but thought we would take a chance, since the price was right.  I am so glad we took the chance.  It now has 95,000 miles on it and runs great. I love the 4 doors, and the 4 Wheel Drive features.  It has never given us problems and we just changed the spark plugs at 94,000, which by the way was the first time they were ever changed, just because we thought it was time to change them.  It doesn't use a drop of oil, and handles very well in all the snow we get here in Wisconsin.  It even does well for gas mileage on the trips we occasionally take.  I would recommend this SUV to anyone out there, it's a great ride for the money.<br><br>
