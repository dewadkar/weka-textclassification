            I bought this Alfa 164L in 2001 with about 175,000 miles for $3000. It is a fantastic car, and with regular upkeep like timely oil changes and being aware of fluid levels, it has not caused me any problems. It is very fast, roomy and has a smooth ride, with few rattles. Everything inside is leather. The styling, however,is straight out of the 80s. To some this may be an advantage!

What I have found most impressive about this car is the automatic transmission. I have never owned an automatic before but I have driven many that are not anything I would ever want to own. However the Alfa is so nice to drive, even as an automatic. The shifting is very smooth, and it shifts up just when necessary, but it doesn't jolt you out of your seat like many american cars do. Best of all, it shifts down when you have your foot off the accelerator for more than a few seconds, or when you brake lightly (i.e. when traffic in front of you slows down).

Best of all is the panel of buttons that you have to control the position of your seat, the temperature in the car, to open the trunk or the gas lid, power windows and door locks, fog lights, rear defrost, cruise control, and on and on. There are over 50 buttons to push in this car! It even has rear seat heaters! For this amount of money, there is NO other car on the market that offers this about of luxury.

My father has a 93 Saab 9000 Turbo (which, albeit,is faster than the Alfa) but has pretty much the same creature comforts as my Alfa. But that car is worth about $10,000 now in 2001!

I have been warned that with this car you have to replace the timing belt frequently. Also it is very hard to fix the A/C, and people say once the gears in the air conditioning have broken, the value of the car plummets.
However, I have had no problems whatsoever with this car despite it's bad reputation for reliability. But it is a little quirky - it's got a control panel of about 15 warning lights underneath the speedometer in the dash, and occasionally those lights come on (example, the oil light came on the other day, and I know the oil was full. As soon as I turned the car off and restarted it, the light was off). 
Overall an excellent car, but you should know a little about cars to own one, or be willing to take it to the shop once in a while, just like any other older car.
