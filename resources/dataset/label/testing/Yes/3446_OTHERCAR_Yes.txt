            Introduction:	

	For all you non-believers that do not think that Acura (Honda) could make a fast powerful car, fun to drive, and have it all nice and roomy have something coming for ya. Introducing The Acura CL type S. With 260 Hp underneath the hood and 0-60 timed at around 6.6 second this car is quite a &quot;Rice Rocket&quot;. 

	I had the chance to drive the CL when I was going around buying a car for my sister. Keep in mind that she is a labor lawyer that needs a car that screams luxury and yet she wants to let loose on the weekends and let the rubber burn. I found that this car gets you the most bang for your buck compared to the other cars such as the BMW M3 and the Volvo V70 which is in the same class as the Acura CL 

Exterior:

	The exterior of the car has updated looks from the older CL models.  The lines are more clearly defined and it looks more aggressive.  Comparing the TL looks to the CL though is kinda like comparing the Toyota Camery to the Solara, meaning that there are great differences but not enough to go and say that they are in different classes.  Overall the exterior looks for the car is very easy on the guys and might even turn a few heads.

Interior:

	With Acura boosting the interior space a whole 5.3 cubic feet making the new net total to 90 cubic feet, it makes the car feel a lot roomier.  The back seats are very nice and comfortable and they are even roomy.  
	
	The Dash is now more of a sport look than the older luxury look.  All of the instrumentation is in Analog, even though some people complained that the tachometer blended in with the speedometer, I couldn't really see what they meant.  

	I found that all of the controls in the CL where very driver orientated, all of the switches were pointed to me and I could reach everything and control everything without taking my eyes off the road to find the switch.  

Features:	

	All CL's come with auto-climate control, six speaker BOSE music system which has a cassette deck, AM/FM stereo and comes with an in dash CD changer, so there is no need to go into the trunk anymore.  While we are in the subject of the trunk, I came upon an amazing discovery.  That the trunk had no keyhole; instead you open it from your remote or from the inside of the car.  

	From its big brother the Acura NSX, the CL borrows the sport shift, which is a clutch-less automatic in a sense. The CL moves like a Honda prelude with the transmission in the sport shift position, it growls when you want it to and it purrs when you want it to. 

	Acura's Traction Control System (TCS) and Acura's Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) makes the car a lot easier to drive in sticky situations.  VSA makes the throttle, fuel injection and brakes control the traction control, antilock braking and stability improvement help the driver control the car better during cornering, and acceleration. And Acura even lets us disable the VSA and TCS while leaving ABS fully functional. 


Engine:

	The engine of the Acura CL Type S is no other than a VTEC monster of 260 horsepower and 232 foot-pounds of torque.  That's a whole 30 percent increase over the last year model of the CL.  The Acura CL Type S even outranks the M3 in ponies by 20 hp.  

Safety:

	Acura made the CL to exceed the new 2002 federal head-impact safety regulations. Advanced safety-cage construction, side-impact door beams, strategic structural reinforcements, new dual-stage front airbags, front seatbelt pretensioners and a seat-mounted side-airbag system were included for safety. 
	
And for the headlights Acura gave the CL Xenon High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlights provide 40 percent more lighting than regular headlights. 


Closing:
	
	My final last thought is that whoever wants to buy the Acura CL Type S should drive like a mental patient that just escaped, running red lights to your nearest Acura Dealer. With the price and the power of this car I can't possibly see how it could stick around in the lot.
