            This review is for my father's 1996 Sebring Convertible JXi which I drive about as much as him.

Overall, this is a very enjoyable car to drive, top up or down. It handles well and has decent acceleration. This is not a vehicle you cross-shop with a Miata or 3-Series convertible. There actually are few competitors in its price range with the Mustang V-6 and Eclipse Spyder perhaps being the closest.

The interior is roomy with plenty of legroom for normal sized backseaters. The CD/Cassette stereo works well and is clear even with the top down. The A/C cools things off fine when the temperatures rise.

The convertible top lowers by unlatching two hooks on the upper edge of the windshield and pressing a toggle lever on the center console. It takes perhaps 20-30 seconds to fully retract. There is a flexible leather boot that can be attached to cover the top for a cleaner look. Important note: the rear window is glass and therefore less prone to scratching and hazing and includes a defroster.


The seats are comfortable but could use a bit more side bolstering, especially for spirited driving. The back seat has plenty of room and is comfortable for extended driving. The ride itself is a little rough, but there isn't a great deal of cowl shake, a common problem in convertibles that are less rigid than their hardtop counterparts.

We really would have liked a stick-shift or at least the now-available clutchless autostick. We find ourselves shifting it manually between Drive and "3" just to put a little sport into our driving. The brakes work fine and we've noticed no problems.

The engine has about 168hp and needs a little more. It pulls eagerly, but with the added weight of the convertible hardware and an automatic, it lacks low-end grunt and passing power.

The car, now six years old, is still stylish and appealing. The body has held up well driving on some well-worn and weathered North Carolina roads. We've had no mechanical problems to mention.

Bottom line: If you want a convertible to be your only car, this is the one. With honest room for four, an acceptable ride and good fuel economy, you can't go wrong with a Sebring. By buying a used one today, you can take advantage of the higher-than-normal depreciation and get a great convertible at a great price.
