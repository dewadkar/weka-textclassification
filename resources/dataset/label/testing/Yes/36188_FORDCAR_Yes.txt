            My husband and I bought this car while looking for something that was amercian made, will last a long time and be good for the family we want to start next year. So far, so good.  I love the way it drives, sorry I can't go into details, but i don't know much about cars. It is a lot of fun to drive. I just love the safety features such as driver and passenger air-bags, the new LATCH system and the upper tether anchors(both for child safety seats).  The only problem is that we have had to take the car in to get the passenger door fixed. The clips on the inside panel broke and had to be replaced. I don't know anyone who should not buy this vehicle. The driver seat is adjustable so even short people like me(at 5'3&quot;) can see over the back,as it is a little higher than the front. 
My husband didn't really want a &quot;family car&quot;, but this is sporty enough to make him happy. He really likes driving the car too. 
The CD player sounds great and I love having speakers in the doors rather than the dashboard. It sounds much better, IMO.
