            4X4, 4.6 L, standard, XLT, Off Road package, extended cab

I purchased this vehicle as an alternative to a SUV.  I have owned the truck for approximately one year.  Overall, I have been very pleased with most aspects of the truck.  For a truck, it drives great on highways, side roads and off road.  I purchased an extended cab, which I use for transporting both passengers and all kinds of other stuff.  In one year I have put approx. 24,000 miles on the truck and except for standard maintenance (oil changes, etc.), there have been no problems.

The local dealer - for both parts and service - is horrible.  I travel 30 miles to another dealer for decent service.  The local Ford dealer is so bad, that if that were my only option, I wouldn't buy another Ford.

Cons: Paint.  I could scratch the paint down to bare metal with my fingernail.  Any small stones or branches scratch the paint down to the metal.

Also, overall fit of major body components was / is poor.  Bumper was misaligned, from the factory.  Alignment of fenders, etc is poor.<br><br>
