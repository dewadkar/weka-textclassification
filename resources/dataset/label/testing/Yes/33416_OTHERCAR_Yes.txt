            This would be my third Jetta purchase...a bright red 1999 VW Jetta GLS.  The redesign was well overdue and was done very well.  The styling is superb though a bit un-finished in the front.  The rear is superb and adds the sporty touch the previous models didn't have unless you added the rear trunk fin.  On the 1999+ versions the rear trunk fin isn't necessary to make this car a very nice looking sport sedan.

The interior is superb.  My recommendation...test drive this car after dark.  When you see the bright blue and red lighted instrument panel you will instantly be in love.  Trust me...it will get a lot of attention from your passengeres as well.  My two problems with the interior of the new version...there should be more choices of fabric options for the GLS version and the large storage area in the very center of the console makes it appear something is missing...it should be moved lover on the console.

The drivability is fantastic.  Thought it only boosts a 115hp 4cyl engine you will notice a dramatic amount of low and high end acceleration.  The handling is every bit german engineering and can hold its own with the best of them.<br><br>
