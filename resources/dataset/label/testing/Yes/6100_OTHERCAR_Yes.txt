            I bought my 2000 Chevy Impala in September of 1999. The car had recently debuted and it looked impressive. I had been driving a 1995 Ford Windstar that I also bought right after it was introduced. I was ready to trade in the family van for a fun to drive car. My son was turning 16 and I wanted him to learn to drive a car, not a van. The safety features on the Impala were a big factor in my choice. I also liked the body style.

There are many things that I love about this car, although I have to admit that I missed my Windstar at first. The difference in interior size was the biggest downfall. I used to be the carpool mom, and I no longer was able to fit as many kids in the Impala. This turned out to be a very positive change. I was always the one called upon to pick up and drop off my kids friends. Now it's nice to get in my car and just leave without making 4 or 5 stops around town. I have since gotten used to the size and find it very comfortable and easy to drive. I used to feel like I was sitting on the ground because the Windstar was so high, but now I love the maneuverability of the Impala.

Now that the car is almost a year old and has over 15,000 miles on it, (I drive a lot!), I feel qualified to recommend it to everyone. It has been all through New England and to Washington DC a few times. It has braved the streets of New York City numerous times as well as most of the East Coast. North Carolina is next. As you can see, we take it everywhere because it is so comfortable.

I love the moon roof, sound system, interior space, huge trunk, and the split rear seat with trunk access.The only drawback that I notice is the heating and cooling system. The vents blow on your hands as you drive. There is very little turning radius for the vents so it can be very annoying. Both my husband and son agree with this assessment. The other problem is the rear passengers are too warm while the front is freezing. There is no separate rear vent. My daughter always complains that she is hot! If I were able to make any changes to the Impala, It would be to add a rear vent and change the location of the front vents.

The car is very easy to drive. My son is about to get his license in a few weeks and has been thrilled to drive this car! I also can't get my husband out of the driver's seat. It has great cornering capabilities, it is very peppy on the highway, and has very wide and plush front bucket seats. The rear seat is also comfortable, except for the rear middle. No one likes to sit there because of the bump. It is a 5 passenger car, but really fits only 4 adults. The rear seat is for 3 passengers only if they are children.

I would highly recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
