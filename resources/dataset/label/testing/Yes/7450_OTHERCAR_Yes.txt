            Every since they came out with the new body style in 99 this has been one of the best looking cars on the road.  I really have no grips with the car, the only problem I had with it is that the display on the radio was acting up, but the was under warranty so it did not cost a thing.

This car is great the V6 has plenty of power to get you wherever you want to go in a hurry and I do mean in a hurry.  It has a real sleek and sporty design and that can't be bad.  The thing handles like a dream, I feel like I am driving a sports car, but it drives way to smooth to be a sports are.  It is the perfect mix of the sporty Firebird and the luxury Bonneville.  I get between 25 and 32 miles to a gallon on the interstate and right at about 20 on normal roads.  The only problem with gas is that the gas itself costs to much right now.  It has a good sized trunk, but I will say you are limited as to what you can fit into it because the opening is a shade to small.  I have all leather in my car, though the leather is a bit stiff it sits comfortably.  There is a lower back support in the drivers seat for those of you who have back problems.  It actually has a good bit of room in the interior which was very surprising in my opinion.  

I will have to say that my favorite thing about this car is the stereo system, 6 speakers with an 7 band equalizer.  The thing rocks and that is all you need to know about it.  Over all I paid $19,985.  I had customer preference as well, plus the GM gold card(a must if you like GM).  I would have to say that among the possible substitutes for this car, this is by far the best of the bunch.  The other are either not quite as comfortable, don't drive as nice, or are a little to pricey.  I would say that if you get a Grand Am it is a good investment.
