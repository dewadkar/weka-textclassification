            I have owned a Ford Ranger extended cab for 6 years now. It is a 1993
with a 3.0 engine. It has required very nominal maintenance since I 
purchased it. With the exception of expendables like tires,wiper blades
etc., I have only had one maintenance related problem. I needed to 
replace the heater hose that went from the water pump to the heater core.
I did have to replace both hoses because they are sold in matched and
banded sets from the dealer only. This could be more user friendly. It
would be nice to see these offered individually. The return hose going from the heater core to the thermostat was still in excellent condition.
I have moved three households and everything else under the sun in this jewel with no other complaints. All in all this has been the best vehicle I have owned since I had a 1965 Dodge Dart with the 225 slant &quot;6&quot;, (that was many, many years ago). I currently have 106,000 miles on this truck.
I am a senior mechanic and the last thing I want to do is work on my vehicle when I get home. I give this vehicle &quot;2 wrenches up&quot;.
