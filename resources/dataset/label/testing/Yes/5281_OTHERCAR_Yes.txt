            When you need a car and fast, something reliable and efficient gives you less headaches and takes the decision out of the picture.  The accord is the answer.

I bought the 98 v6 sedan.  at the time, it was the first 200hp v6 vtec.  that was great but the 0-60 of 8.0sec is a bit disappointing.  then again, a honda is conservative.  but, you get the kick when u need it and it does fine in snow.

the interior of the car is excellent.  the dials are placed at natural positions.  the ergonomics of the car are unparalleled.  the radio is superb with alpine made speakers and receiver.  (the dealer told me so)  also, it allows you to install a 6 cd changer on your own from alpine.  but then the receiver cd is rendered useless.  The car includes steering wheel controls of the stereo and cruise control which are necessary to prevent accidents.  the feature is purely genius and life saving.

the leather is a nice touch, but that sort of contradicts the rugged appeal of the car.  Your ass will slip and slide while in the seats.  one would think that honda would include bucket seats in a 200hp car.  other than that, the seat belt will hold you in place a bit.  

trunk space is adequate, unless u have skis or large golf bags.  then you will have to be a magician to produce more space.  there is a handy grocery hook for eggs and extra panels to store necessities like ice picks and inflators.  

The accord offers some luxury, convenience, and a piece of mind for an affordable price.<br><br>
