            First of all, I should tell you that this was purchased a while ago (2/01) things have changed for Digital Cameras since then.  This 2.1 mega pixel camera was retailing for $900 - $700 at the time.  Additionally, top of the line ($2000) cameras were 3 mega-pixels.  Now this unit is as low as $360 and the best cameras are 5 mega pixels.  This kind of thing will always occur with gadgets.  Nevertheless, I would certainly not say that this camera is obsolete.

<b>Why I bought it...back then</i>
For one thing this camera caught my eye.  It's metal color and high-tech appearance is attractive to me.  I began searching Olympus from the start, because I owned a 35mm Olympus and liked it.  I did my research by looking at the pictures taken by several cameras and this camera's pictures stood out.  Here is an example of one that I took simply by pointing and shooting on the low quality setting (visit http://parkfestival.homestead.com/files/PFB17.jpg).  (Note original size of photo was several times bigger than the screen...I shrunk to 800x600 pixels).  
<i>Prerequisites</i>
*Movie mode: camera films movies for several seconds or longer (depends on memory)
*Rechargeable Batteries: Camera should take a type of batteries that can be recharged
*Zoom Lens: This is by no means standard, in fact an effective zoom is very rare
*Connectivity: This camera can be interfaced with PC via USB cable or smart card reader (both widely available)
*LCD Screen: although it eats batteries, w/out an LCD display, not only can you not look at your pics w/out PC.  There are some photos that you simply cannot take w/out LCD screen to look at.

<b>Features</b>
As with its 35mm counterpart, this camera does anything you can think of.  You can control every function, right down to shutter speed.  For example you can photograph race cars by changing shutter speed to a fraction of a second. You can specify quality to be as good as TIF (Targa Image Files - Professional) or as poor as Jpeg's (web quality graphics).  

<b>Shortcomings</b>
I love this camera, but as always I must note the negatives.  Large camera, it is three times the size of a Cannon Elph.  In other words this isn't going in any pocket.  It comes with only 8mb memory card (holds only 32 standard pictures) and a USB cable (goes from camera to CPU - meaning that camera must be turned on and engaged to transfer pics).  Most folks would want to upgrade memory card to 64mb (holds almost 200 pics) and use a smart media card reader (device allows you to use only card to transfer photos - freeing up camera and conserving battery).
