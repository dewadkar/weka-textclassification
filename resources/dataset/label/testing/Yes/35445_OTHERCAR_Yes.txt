            The Sony DSC-F707 has finally made it's debut in Canada !  For those of you who have read my other reviews, you will know that I already own a Canon G2, but I have been incredibly impressed with the improvements that Sony has been making in their digital cameras!

The 707 is similar to the evolution of the G2 from the Canon G1.  Compared to its predecessor, the F505, the F707 boasts an impressive 5.0 megapixel resolution with an even faster Carl Zeiss Lens.  The maximum aperture on the F707 is an impressive 2.0 allowing one to shoot in extremely low light conditions (other features that have been added to the F707 also aid in doing this), and an extremely impressive battery life.  Some noticeable improvements over many of their previous digital cameras are a very quick autofocus (I can't stress how much better this is compared to other digital cameras), and an extremely quick shutter release.  I'll be getting to more specifics about certain features later in the review.

What comes with the camera:
-A NP-FM50 infolithium rechargeable battery
-USB and audio video cable
-16 MB memory stick
-AC adaptor
-MGI Photosuite 8.1, Videowave SE, and your USB drivers (for those of you that are running windows XP, this is a plug and play camera)
-And of course, all your little accessories like your lens cap, shoulder strap, and lens strap.

Now that all of that has been said let's get down to what I really like and dislike about this camera.

As stated earlier, I made a comment about the quick autofocus and quick shutter release.  When comparing the autofocus system to that of other brands and even previous Sony digital cameras one could pretty much forget about taking any fast action shots, or if doing so would have to manually focus the camera at the preset distance.  With the F707, you can realistically expect autofocus times to be as quick as mid-range SLR's, when coupled with the shutter release.  So if you are looking for a high resolution camera that you require to be capable of quick shots, this is one of the few that should be on your list (excluding pro bodies like the D1X, Canon D30, etc...)  To notice the improvement you really have to go down to your local digital camera dealer and try this camera next to a different one.  I would go so far as to guess, that this is what one can expect of the upcoming Nikon Coolpix 5000, which boasts an impressive 66ms shutter release time (We received our Coolpix 5000's last week and as fast as the Sony is, it is not as fast as the Coolpix 5000).

The lens, this camera has a beautiful lens.  Sharp, beautiful color reproduction, and an impressive 5x optical zoom.  There is a manual focus ring on the end of the lens (this is nice, as opposed to the G2, where you actually use the buttons to control the focus), and a 58mm diameter lens thread for accesory filters (Update, it has been brought to my attention that one can use any 58mm filter on the end of the DSC-F7070).  Whether or not one has to use Sony filters exclusively I have yet to find out but do plan on looking into.  Unlike most digital cameras the zoom control is located on the left side at the end of the lens, which once you get used to is a much more intuitive (IMHO) place to put it as opposed to using the thumb control at the top right rear of the camera.  It helps give the camera more of an SLR setup, and feel.

When shooting in low light with the F707, the fast lens definitely helps but there are two new features which Sony has added.  One being the nightframe feature which is similar to what they have on their camcorders.  What this basically allows you to do is to see what you are actually shooting (in extremely low light situations) to compose and set up your shot before hitting the shutter button.  You have to try this to see how good it really works.  Kudos to Sony for including this on this camera, really a very good idea.  Also they have incorporated a feature which they have called Nightshot, what this feature does is allow you to take a shot that will basically look like you were looking through a set of nightvision goggles (same idea).  Kind of a neat feature as you could conceivably take a picture in a very dark room without anybody even knowing.   Battery life, now this is impressive.  Sony claims that one can expect over 2000 shots with the LCD on using the included battery.  I myself have never tested this personally but if it is even half of that, this completely blows the competition away.  And to think that I was impressed with my Canon G2's ability to take over 400 shots with the LCD display on.

Similar to the LCD screen on the Canon G series where you can flip it out and rotate it, Sony has taken things and reversed them, so instead of rotating the LCD screen, with the F707 you are actually rotating the whole rear of the camera body.  In use, this has some practical advantages over Canon's system especially when shooting over objects or shooting at waist level.  One being a sturdier design, but it takes away from some of the flexibility that the Canon design has. 

Overall those are the features that I find sets the Sony apart from similar class cameras, as well as I have found useful.  

Now some things I am not to keen about the F707.  First off, shape.  The shape of the camera is not exactly condusive to it being an easy to carry camera.  Good luck on finding a good aftermarket camera bag for it, and the Sony case for it costs around 130 dollars CDN, and it's not even a hard case, or exremely well padded case for that matter.

The fact that it only comes with a 16 MB memory stick.  Granted, Canon and a few others, have barely started to include more storage with their newer digital cameras, but this is an 1800 dollar plus tax camera we are talking about.  At 5.0 megapixels, with a decent rate of compression, you'll be lucky to hold 10 shots on that tiny stick.  They really should have included at least a 32 MB memory stick.  This also brings me to the point of the memory stick having a higher per megabyte cost then other forms of storage.

And probably the biggest thing I dislike about the F707, the digital viewfinder.  Granted, companies like Minolta have also started using this feature.  Main reason being is that it cuts down tremendously on cost and the size of the camera.  But with all digital viewfinders (despite their ability to help compose a shot in low light) is that there tends to be a certain amount of lag once you start panning with the camera.  It may be just me, but this makes me feel a little queasy.  And last but not least, is the fact that you have to switch between the digital viewfinder or using the LCD display.  Minolta has a good thing going by installing their eye sensors next to the viewfinder so that it will turn on or off automatically.  I find it inconvenient to always have to switch between the two.

To conclude all of this, should you get this camera ?  I personally do like the camera very much, and when comparing it to the Minolta Dimage 7, I would take the Sony over the Dimage in an instant (despite some advantages that the Dimage has).  But if you can hold out, I would seriously give it some thought as to whether or not you need a 5.0 megapixel camera (they are pretty expensive since they aren't as common) and if you can wait until the Nikon Coolpix 5000 comes out.  Although the Coolpix 5000 only has a three times optical wide angle zoom.  From those that have used it, I have heard it is an extremely impressive piece of machinery.

Like all of my reviews, if you have found this useful, I would appreciate being added to your web of trust, but if not please leave me some feedback and I will respond to it and improve the review in whatever way necessary. Should you have any questions about the F707 that you'd like answered, I'd be happy to answer them via e-mail 

Thanks for taking the time to read this review =)
