            Launched in 1998 as a joint replacement for both the European and US versions of the all conquering Escort, the Ford Focus has swept all before it, scooping up both the European and North American Car of the Year awards.  Designed by Ford's European division it has established itself as a firm favourite to all classes of motorist.

Even in the US, where Ford's European models have traditionally fared badly (witness the likes of the '78 Fiesta, the disastrous Merkur line, and more recently, the Contour/Mercury Mystique - based on the European Ford Mondeo), the Focus has taken consumers by storm since its launch in 2000.

Ironically, the key to this sucess is the Focus's European design - it was designed jointly at Ford's engineering centres in Germany and England.  Coming from a part of the world where speed limits are much higher than in the US, fuel is heavily taxed, roads are small, twisty and congested - cars need to be small, powerful, economical and agile.  The Focus excels in all these areas, boasting class leading driving manners, impressive fuel economy and punchy engines.

So what do you get for your money.? All Focuses come in a choice of 4 door sedan, 5 door station wagon, and 3 and 5 door hatchback.  The hatch is easily the best looker of the family, with its high level rear lamp clusters and edgy hatch profile - it is the most popular body style in the Focus's native Europe, so it is no surprised that this is the most polished of the three bodystyles.  

Power comes courtesy of Ford's Zetec-SE and Zetec-E engine families, the former only seen in Europe in 1.4 and 1.6 litre guises, while the latter is seen in 1.8 and 2.0 litre capacities.  The US gets a single cam 2.0 engine, but doesn't get the Duratorq and Endura turbo-diesels that are incredibly popular over the pond.  Suspension is traditional MacPherson struts at the front, while at the rear is a multi-link arrangement derived from that used in the Ford Mondeo/Contour.   

The driver will not be disappointed, the Focus corners like it is on rails and imparts a sense of security to the driver that no other car in its class can match.  The 1.8 litre engine is the best of the lot - turning in an impressive 115bhp, and delivering its power in a delightfully linear and unfussed fashion.  Enthusiasts will love the classic twin-cam growl as you change up the gears.  And that cable-operated gearshift is a delight to use; together with a new hydraulically operated clutch - cog changing has never been such a pleasure.

Passengers are well catered for as well.  The dashboard design with its striking "New Edge" angles and curves takes some getting used to, but faultless ergonomics and high-quality switchgear and instrumentation are standard in all European Fords, and the Focus is no exception.  The seats are firm and comfortable, and all models boast a high level of specification, power windows + mirrors, aircon, and heated windscreen among the available options.

Gripes??  Well not many.....but there are a few.  There have been a few quality niggles on US models in particular, from premature brake disc failures and some scaremongering about possible engine fires.  Were it not for the near-Mercedes standard of interior quality of the latest VW Golf and Jetta, the Focus would rank as feeling fairly affulent inside.  But some of the shiny plastic mouldings fail to impress under scrutiny.  That wacky styling may also be the Focus' biggest asset, or its biggest liability - depending on whose view you take.  

Fords used to be famed for being easy to maintain at home as well......well in a few years time the DIY mechanic is going to be disappointed, as not only is the Focus's engine compartment crammed full of stuff so tightly that one wonders how they got the engine in there in the first place, it is loaded with a lot of complex electronics......it's goodbye to the simple car.....

But on the whole the Ford Focus thoroughly deserves its generally excepted status as the best compact family car in the world, and it is well worth a look for those looking for that little something extra from a family hack.
