            I love this truck. After minivans, full size Blazers, small SUVs and Explorers, finally our family has an SUV to fit us all in comfort, and carry my tools. Actually stretching legs in the back seat, with lots of WIDTH. 5 King size adults are comfortable.
We have the 4.6 V8. I think the mpg is great for the weight, 14 mpg for 5800 lbs, real world driving. I laugh at others who are driving 2500 lb cars, cramped up, getting 22 mpg. When gas goes back up to $2-3/gallon, they will laugh. Ford truck reliable.  

I like the fact that the seats fold down for cargo. It really is huge, almost a fullsize van. No more humping mini van seats into the garage. 

It is tall. You have to be prepared to know exactly the height for city and mall garage parking. And even when using the mirrors, small cars are hard to see when backing up, merging, or changing lanes, so be careful. Especially when being passed on the right, common in NY/NJ, even though they are breaking the law. They move right over to that shoulder, kind of like gnats. 
I haven't taken it off road much yet. Soon. But curbs are no problem. I can see how people roll these, but you have to be going over 40 mph and making a pretty sharp turn, so far anyway. 
I am looking forward to the snow this winter.
