            I have a rather large family that seems to travel continuously.  Since I am 19 and my youngest sibling is six months we use the family car as an every day necessity.  

The Lincoln Continental is so perfect for older parents who don't want to worry about maneuvering a mini-van or squeezing three kids in the front bench seat!  It is most comfortable, in fact when my family and I go on a rode trip my dad drives and my mother always sits in the back, which is something she would never do in any other car!  She can better attend my youngest brother, Clyde that way.  In our prior cars sitting in the back was something my mother avoided like the plague, but not with our new/ used Lincoln Town Car.  

The comfortable leather seating is the kind that puffs up and skwishes down when you sit.  There uis plenty of lighting so my mother and I can read at night when we are traveling.  The center console serves us well for drink holders and playing cards.  We have been through many different family cars and never found such a comfortable and luxurious one that we have kept for more than a year.  This one is on its third year in our family and when it dies I wouldn't be surprised if they buy another one.

I highly recommend this car to anyone.  It is a smooth ride and good for multiple people.  You can't go wrong with a car this size, style, and comfort level.  It is also very affordable if you buy a good used one.  For 9,000 dollars we have had a more than satisfactory 2 and a half years.  They are reliable enough to buy used!  The car we have has had nothing more than its scheduled tune ups and has needed nothing more. <br><br>
