            I got my Kodak Easyshare CX4230 in August of 2003, in preparation for a trip to Disneyworld and fell in love with it! 
It has 2 MP, which is enough resolution for the 4x6 photos I print and is great for the slideshows I like to make with it. I can print 8x10 with it too and it works fine for that as well if I use the "best" setting. I usually use the "better" setting to get more pictures per memory card and when I use that setting the camera only uses 1 MP so it's best for small prints or computer/TV viewing.
The 3x optical zoom is great for zooming in to get a nice close up of people or objects without getting "in their faces" with the camera. 
The color is great, the flash is enough for what I need. (I even took a picture of a deer in the back of DH's truck from our porch in pitch black nighttime. Just guessed where it would be**, pointed and shot. Got a pretty good picture from that!) 
**I do use the optical viewfinder to save on battery life. I took around 400 pictures at WDW and only had to change batteries once during that time. Another plus of using the optical viewfinder is that the camera will go into "auto digital zoom" mode if you use the LCD viewfinder and zoom in too much. Digital zoom just makes things grainy, so I avoid it like the plague. By keeping the LCD turned off, I get nice clear shots. I do use the LCD after I take photos to make sure I got a good shot. This is quick and easy to do by using the review button on the back of the camera.
The flash is easy to adjust as there is a button on the back that just controls flash. Auto, Fill, Red-eye Reduction, and Off are the available choices.
The shutter speed is nice and fast- I took pics of my DD juggling scarves and nothing at all in the pic is blurry.
This camera has built in 16 MB memory, which is twice the amount on most digital cameras with onboard memory. I got 28 more pictures at WDW after I had run out of memory on my 128 MB SD card. According to the manual, it can get up to 48 pictures on the "better" setting, but mine were pretty loaded with detail, so the files were larger. 
I love the ability to create a slideshow on the TV with this camera! I plug the video cable (included) into the TV and use an audio camera and DVD player to add music. Then I start the slideshow and the CD of my choice, and record this onto videotape. I do look forward to getting a DVD burner to make this more "high tech" but the videotape works fine for now and it's very cute with the appropriate music in the background. The camera default is 5 seconds per slide, but you can make the intervals longer. (5 seconds is the minimum allowed per picture).
The software is nice - I like the albums it creates and that I can pick and choose which pictures to download and have them put into any album I choose as they download. The software version that came with my camera (2.1?) was *terrible* at red-eye fixing. Nothing happened, no matter how many times I clicked it. But I downloaded the free upgrade and now it works wonderfully! One click per eye and any red-eye is GONE!
Over all, this is a great little camera for the price. I paid $150 for it at Walmart, and I've seen it online since then for just $99.
