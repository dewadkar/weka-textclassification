            The current model original Jeep Cherokee is possibly the best value in the marketplace today.  Whether you choose the base &quot;Sport&quot;, intermediate &quot;Classic&quot; or the top end &quot;Limited&quot; model you can't loose.   Each provide terrific durability and road skills for an extremely affordable price.   
I opted for a 1998 Black Cherokee Classic that listed for just over $23,000.  The interior size is sufficient for most trips to home depot, the beach and camping sites.   
This jeep has been around for almost 15 years now and has undergone many makeovers.  The last makeover in 1998 proved to be the best of all.  The interior fit was really improved.  The old annoying placement of the power window levers has been changed and the heating cooling system has finally been brought into the 20th century.  (Music lovers should opt for the factory installed Infinity sound system, it rocks!) 
The 4.0L straight six packs enough power for towing small to mid size loads.  This is also a little bit of a downer, because in normal driving conditions it really guzzles gas, (15mpg city/21 mpg highway). But that is a small price to pay for the other pluses regarding the truck.  
The steering is tighter than a Grand Cherokee which makes it feel and handle less like a car. But does not make you feel as if you are in a Ford F150 pickup truck.  
In a crowded SUV market place the Cherokees value really stands out.  The Ford Explorer is a bigger truck, but not by much and is priced about $10,000 higher.  The Toyota 4 Runner size is comparable to the Cherokee but it is  about $12,000 more expensive.     
Anyone looking for a mid sized sport ute should seriously consider the Cherokee.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys spending money on a good value.  <br><br>
