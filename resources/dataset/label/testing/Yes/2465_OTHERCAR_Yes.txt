            I purchased the 2003 RWD Infiniti FX35 with only the premium package upgrade (to get the leather interior) in brilliant silver with a graphite (black) interior. It was a replacement for a 1996 Chevy Impala SS and meets all my needs in a car that up until then didn't seem possible. That is, I wanted a car with performance that was a quasi-SUV, yet was reliable. I also wanted something that the socker-Mom/ yuppie crowd wasn't driving which ruled out the Lexus 330 and the BMW X5. The vehicle had to be below $40K out the door.

And so, I found the Infiniti FX35 meets those needs.

What's great about the car is the acceleration, standard features (in dash 6-disc Bose system), great braking, comfortable and stylish interior and seats with plenty of legroom for a tall driver and passengers (I'm 6'4"). I love this vehicle and did a LOT of research before buying it. The Infiniti website is great in helping you locate the exact vehicle you want with the options you want so you don't have to call around. It even gives you the MSRP for the options you want. Gas mileage is about 16MPG in normal driving. That said, I'm pretty nit picky, so here's what you really want to know:

What isn't so great is the visibility (especially out the back window). Visibility out the side also takes some getting used to because the windows are small relative to the doors. Cargo room is also a bit of a joke, especially if the people in the back recline their seats. It seems strange to be driving a car that can hold four people very comfortably, yet be unable to haul the luggage of those same four people if you are going on a road trip. The roof rail option (which I have) makes it possible to fix this through use of a car carrier. If you are seriously considering this car, I strongly recommend reading the section dedicated to the FX35/45 on Freshalloy.com. It is very important to get a later built date car as the ones built at the beginning of the year seem to have a number of problems including a warping hatch fin, rattling sunroof and doors panels, rocking and squeaking front seats, and a few other odd problems. One guy who has already gotten in a minor accident in his FX has had to wait almost 2 months for parts because Infiniti appears to not have thought ahead and the stuff has to be shipped from Japan, which takes forever. Infiniti recently claimed the top spot in customer satisfaction, yet I have read a bunch of complaints about poor customer service. Certainly I would not say my own dealership experience was stellar. Just because it's an upscale car, don't expect any better service then you would get from a Nissan dealer. You still get treated like cattle in my personal opinion and I went to three different dealerships (Discover Infiniti - Escondido, CA), Cerritos Infiniti, and Glendale Infiniti (where I bought the car for $300 over invoice). By the way, Infiniti really DOES charge their dealers a $400 advertising fee on top of what you see on the Edmunds invoice price for the car. I thought this was a scam to get more money out of me when I bought the car, but learned afterwards the dealers weren't lying about this. Something to keep in mind when you bargain for yours.
