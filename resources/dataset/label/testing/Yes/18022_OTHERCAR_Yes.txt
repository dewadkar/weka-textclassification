            I bought this camera so that I could take quick pictures of my architectural models before they rotted away waiting for me to use my 35mm.  Although the d-620L is by now quite a dated machine (it was about a year on the market when I bought it six months ago), and there are many cameras with megapixel capacity higher than 1.4, I assure you that the it is a first-class machine.

One of the best features is the viewfinder/zoom capacity which not only lets you view directly what you are taking a picture of, it also shows it on the screen once you've taken the picture.  the advantage of this is that you get an immediate view of the picture you've taken, but you save an enormous amount of battery power, since you only use the screen for a few seconds per photo.  (And you can even turn that option off, so that the batterries last for a very long time).  I know that many of my friends who have screen-intensive of screen-only digicams have to always keep spare batteries, as the camera dies out very quickly.  The Olympus is a production workhorse.

One reason people might not go for it is because it does not offer many of the options that let really professional photographers customize their photographs, like shutter speeds and exposure settings.  But the plus side of this is that everyone can use it with extremely satisfactory results... (I mention this in contrast to the Nikon coolpix 900, which really requires a lot of tinkering with the results for the optimal usage)

The camera is super-light.  And it is modeled after a long series of sleek 35mm cameras that Olympus is famous for, so you get style, quality, and ease-of-use.  

Also, Camedia is a very user-friendly and fast programme.  I use it to look through other image files on my computer as well - that or ACD-see.  

So it is a good quality camera that is probably one of the best buys for the buck right now, because it has been on the market for such a long time.  Still a quality, quality machine.<br><br>
