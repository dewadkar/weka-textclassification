            We purchased the first Xterra to arrive in our city. Our model was completely loaded with every option for $30,000 CDN ($19,051.51 USD). From a passenger standpoint this vehicle is fantastic. The backseat is particularly spacious and provides the backseat riders a view out the front windshield via elevated stadium seating. The sound system is great and the controls are all very easy to operate. Mechanically speaking we hit a few speedbumps. The first problem involved an incredibly annoying rattling noise in the dashboard that drove my wife insane. It turns out it was just a loose bolt but tracking the noise down took weeks of annoying trips to the dealership. The engine itself is an odd little number. With 170hp you would think that it would be able to shoot off the line and pass with ease. When you stomp on the gas you get a whole lot of noise but very little immediate response. The rpms go through the roof but the Xterra doesn't go anywhere. Eventually it kicks in and you take off but this delay is a bit annoying to say the least. To go along with this, the fuel economy of the XTerra is ok at best. Driving like a maniac in the city will definately eat your gas very quickly. Off Road this vehicle is a blast. We have taken the XTerra through deep snow, rivers, and steep hills and it has eaten everything up and spat it back out. For a young family who doesn't want a minivan, this is a great value and a good choice. If you are looking for an economical SUV, you probably want to think about something closer to a RAV or CRV, because this thristy fellow makes you pay to play.
