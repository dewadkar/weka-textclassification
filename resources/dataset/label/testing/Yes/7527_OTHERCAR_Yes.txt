               I was looking for a car with a lot of room for family and good gas mileage.This car turned out to be a great buy for the money.Other cars costs more and did not 




        have all the options.The only complaint i have is there is some noise when driving on the highway. Sometimes it sounds as if there was a window open.The back seat folds down so you can put a lot of things in the trunk.If you have young children it is ideal because the back seat has hooks for the carseat.                                                                     I would recommend that you get the bigger 4 cylinder engine for power.I have owned about 12 cars in my life and this one rates right up there.Can,t go wrong. Buy it.<br><br>
