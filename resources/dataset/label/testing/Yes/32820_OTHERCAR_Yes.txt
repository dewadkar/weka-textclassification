            I own a 95 Cavalier 4-door. After owning 3 used vehicles this was my first new car purchase. I am very satisfied with it for many reasons. It only takes about $14.00 to fill up with gas, it gets good gas mileage, its very peppy, and the four doors come in very handy when you have to get a 3 year old in and out of a carseat. I haven't had any mechanical problems with it. The only problem I can think of is the latch assembly on the glove compartment broke. That was under $10.00 to replace. Over all I feel this is an affordable, good looking, quality car.<br><br>
