            Plain and simple, this car is one of the most reliable, useful and pleasant cars to own.  I am speaking from experience, as my wife and I are on our second Accord, my parents have had two Accords, and three of my closest friends have owned them.

Sound like a Honda commercial?  It might as well be.  I'd be happy to give a testimonial if asked by Honda.

My wife and I currently own a 1994 EX Accord Sedan equipped with a five speed manual transmission.  It has 85,000 and we've never had any trouble with it.  Such has been the experience of the others I know who own (or owned) one of these cars.

One of the Accord's chief strengths is reliability.  Despite heavy use and mileage, the Accord shows very little wear and tear.  It is &quot;tight&quot; and rattle-free.  The workmanship shows great care and attention to detail.

It also gets very good gas mileage.  As for repairs, I have heard some people voice concern over costs associated with the &quot;regular maintenance&quot; which is recommended by dealerships.  But if you change the oil regularly and take care of the basics on the recommended maintenance schedule, you are unlikely to incur frequent or unscheduled work.  Most Honda service departments which I have dealt with are a little too pushy on &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;scheduled&quot; maintenance.  (Hey, they have to earn some extra $$$ because true break downs with these cars are so infrequent!)

The only drawback that I and my family/friends have noticed sometimes is cargo space.  Our particular Accord has a small trunk compared to its competition.  However, if you are looking at brand new Accords, do not fear.  The current model is larger and more roomy than any previous one.  I've looked at the trunk myself, and its size is back on par with competitors.

Some other folks think that the Accord's styling is too bland, and similar things have been stated about the styling of the Toyota Camry (probably the Accord's closest competitor).  I regard the car's looks as attractive and poised.

Bottom line: if you are looking for the ultimate in hassle-free, satisfying ownership, go with the Accord.  You'll spend a few more dollars than you would on a domestic vehicle if you are buying a brand-new model, but in the long run, the value for your dollar will go much further.  Or you can get one with a few miles on it and just a couple of years old.  If the previous owner has taken care of it, you'll be on your way to many satisfying years of ownership.<br><br>
