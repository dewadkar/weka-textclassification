            I bought my 1999 Chevy Express 1500 van back in August of 1999.  I bought a van because I needed to tow my boat.  I bought this van because it was bigger, nicer, and less expensive than the Chevy Astro van...a lot cheaper.  

I love this vehicle because it has pep, looks very nice, and would make a great long trip feel more comfortable.  I hate this van because it seems I am always filling up the tank.  The tank is 32 gallons and I get about 400 miles to the fill up.  I'm just use to my 4 cylinder car that would go forever before a fill up.  

Even though this van is very big it drives small.  The only problem I find is that backing up can be difficult....which is my own confidence.  I find when I get out I still have plenty of room left.  If you have a large family I think this van would be wonderful for you.  We will probably start having kids in a few years and the van will be almost paid for so it should be just fine.<br><br>
