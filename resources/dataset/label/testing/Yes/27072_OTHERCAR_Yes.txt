             First of all, I am using a webtv so I will use the dot system to separate my paragraphs.   -----------------------------------------------------I recently purchased a 1993 Mercury Tracer station wagon from a local dealership.  I chose a station wagon as my first vehicle because it is roomy and versatile.  To me, a station wagon has always seemed like a family car.  I come from a rather large family with quite a few nieces and nephews and I wanted a vehicle that would easily fit a child safety seat in the back.  This particular model earned an A for that feature. -----------------------------------------------------I also liked the way that the station wagon drove when I took it for a test drive.  Although it is a smaller car than the old station wagons, it had a lot of power.  The model I purchased is an automatic and the shifting column is on the floor which made it more accessible to me. -----------------------------------------------------This car has quite a few cool things about it.  Even though it is a station wagon which I swore I would never own, it looks rather sporty.  Some of the features that appealed to me included; the curtain, a good air conditioning/heating system, child safety lock for the back seats, rear defrost and wiper blades with fluid in the back.-----------------------------------------------------Some of the things that are cool but can be a pain in the butt are manual windows and manual door locks.  The gas tank is a locked fixture and has to be opened by pulling a lever inside of the car.  This lever does sometimes stick.  There is also a button to push if the gear shift sticks, but you must roll the button while putting the car into gear which is tricky to do.  -----------------------------------------------------My little station wagon does really good on gas.  The brakes are touchy and the gas pedal needs to be stomped but that is just the way that this car was made.  If these little things do not really bother you, then I would recommend this car to anyone.  Everyone who rides in my car or drives my car comments on how nice it is.  I like it and find it to be a really good value for all the little extras it gives me.    <br><br>
