            The Infiniti G20T is the personification of the word UNDERSTATEMENT.

Think of a car with all the amenities such as leather seats, ABS, AC, all power windows, keyless entry, Heated mirrors (Ok hyundai has it), sun roof, a spoiler, 15 inch alloy rims, 6-speaker, 100 watt sound system, limited slip differential, 145 HP engine, 25/31 MPG, a car maker name that is "up there" with Lexus and BmWs and AUdis, and brings a lot of attention whether you like it or not.

All for about $23,000.  Now its under $17,000

Think.  

Infiniti's G20T.  Understatement, defined.

This car was put down with such remarks as "car with bland styling", "anorexic engine", "so-so design".  Yes those are quotation marks from certain car magazines, whose drivers, drive your "not so everyday ferraris and BMW's".  



I'm still not sure why this car didnt make it to the status of a lets say, Accord or Camry.  This car has more to offer than those said above with it's exceptional price and pampering commodities.  This is a sweet deal.  I was picking on whether to get an Accord or this car.  I bought this one simply because EVERYBODY has an Accord, a Civic, and an Integra.  Not to mention Toyotas, Celicas, IS300s, ES300s, and the like.  This car brings a feeling of exclusivity.

I was in a total flux on which car to get.  Seriously, if I'm going to get a car, I want it to last.  I would also want to stand out.  That means, none of my dads or aunts or cousins or friends or everybody else's car.  Also, when i get older, I dont want to see any teenagers looking at me and thinking Im too old for my car (assuming i got an integra or a celica).  Heck, he might even try to race with me in the stoplight.  I remember my cousin paying $21,000 for a new civic DX.  It came with i guess everything, but wheres the leather?  Wheres the sunroof?  Does she really want the car, or did she get it just because its a civic?  I havent seen her for a while, but i guess i don't want to make her cry when i show her my car.  For the SAME PRICE!!!!  The reality is that theres a lot of people who buys cars they don't really like.  In my cousin's case, she bought the car because she knew it would last her a long time.  Civics have an excellent track record with reliabilty and resale value, but i couldn't imagine myself paying $500 a month for a Civic.  Or a Celica GT.  I couldn't imagine paying $800 a month for an IS300 or a BMW 3series, or an Acura TL.  Those have a V6 to boot, and for regular commuters, sometimes the gas prices can be overwhelming.  In short, the G20 embodies everything you could ever want in a car.  Infiniti G20T.  Sporty, but formal enough to be borrowed by everybody whos gonna go in a wedding.  I bought my car used, and sometimes I thought about buying the brand new accord.  I parked besides one, and I asked myself if I would trade my car for that.  NAAAAAAH.  It's really special because it pampers you with its touch of luxury with more HP than Civics, Integras, Celicas, Accords (non V6s), etc etc.  The interior is a really special one.  It doesn't feel cheap.  It makes me feel I'm in a $30,000 car.  Theres never a cheap feeling with it.  This car stands ABOVE the ALL sub-compact class cars with it's excellent value, reliability, and overall feeling that it gives you.  

This car is one of the strongest values it's class.  Although i'm not sure if it belongs in any.  Disregard its potent 145 SR20DE engine, (the engine has a ton of potential) and you can compare this car to the IS300.  It stands above, and it has no competition.  Move up the ladder of the car heirarchy and yeah its true that this lacks some power.  Oh and did i mention that this car is made by NISSAN?  It's first tune up is not scheduled til after 100,000 miles, so forget that Hyundai warranty eh?  

Let's break it down:

POWER:  145 HP.  This car is spirited, but its HEAVY.  There may be a couple of times when the power isn't there, but this car still inspires confidence because it's got ENOUGH power  to catch 60..quick.  I floored this car a couple of times, and it literally put me on the edge of my seat.  This car can pull!  You'll hear its polite roar, which is controlled by its muffler.  Nice, chromed muffler.  This car may be no match to the V6's of its competition, but it gets the job done satisfyingly.

HANDLING:  This car is tight.  The turn radius is pretty wide, but this car is so easy to handle!  It feels light, but assertive.  I used to drive a Geo Prizm, and uhh, that car feels like you're going to get blown by the wind.  This car however, feels light.  You can feel that you're in control.

BRAKES:
Ok so i may not have the specifics on this, but last night, i was going 40MPH when this guy ran a red light.  I was about to cross the intersection when i noticed he wasnt slowing down.  I stopped a couple of inches beyond the crosswalk, but serious stopping abilities for sure.  It saved me.

LOOKs:  Need i say more?  Own one and you'll understand.  People just cant figure out which car this is, mainly because of its rarity.  It's kind of weird.  This car would GROW on you and to everybody else.  Again, it's the feeling of being the only one in town who has one.

THE BAD

Cup holder.  That cup holder in the dash just can't do it's job.  It's not deep enough to hold a can of soda so dont!  Open the center console and its a lot more secure to put your soda in there.  Unfortunately, theres only room for one.  Dont open your windows when you're going fast...It's pretty loud although a pair of windshield deflectors could help.

Overall, this car is one of the BEST VALUES with the MOST bang for the buck.  Its perfect FOR EVERYBODY.  From teenagers to grandmas, there's no denying the allure of this car.  I'm sure your teen wouldn't mind having this car.  Heck, if they would rather get a different one, I'm sure you wouldn't mind driving this right?  This car gives it's owner SATISFACTION. Isn't it a great feeling of "gladly" paying $$$ for a car, WITHOUT any regrets, qualms or second thoughts?  For me it's all that matters.

Consider your options, and don't ever rush when buying cars.  You deserve your money's worth.
