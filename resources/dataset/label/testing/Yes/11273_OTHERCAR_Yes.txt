            I looked at a lot of small SUVs before choosing the Forester.  Sure it may not have the sexy looks of some of the other models, but I'm too practical to fall for that.  I checked out the Toyota RAV4, the Honda CRV, and the Chevy Tracker.  The RAV4 and CRV weren't bad (forget about the Tracker, everything about it screams CHEAP) but they 1)Didn't do as well in the crash tests (Did pretty poorly actually); 2)Have smaller engines (2.0 liter compared to 2.5 in the Forester - and it does make a difference!); 3)Had rollover warnings because of their top-heavy designs; 4)Didn't have the All Wheel Drive, or as it is also called, all-time four-wheel drive.  Those were the main reasons.  

Of course, price always has a place, and the Subaru was comparable, if not cheaper than the others.  The CRV and RAV4 start out at lower prices, but when you add in all the options that come standard on the Forester, they aren't as cheap as they look.  The Subaru handles nicely, is peppy, and has a nice solid feel to it.  I've had my Subaru about 5 months now and I like it better every day.  

Another nice little bonus is the flat-four engine.  It not only makes the Forester more stable because of the weight distribution, but its configuration allows more room under the hood to reach all the regular maintenance items without being a contortionist.  

The drawbacks are: an uncomfortable rear seat, poor sound system (for this and most of the options be forewarned, they're overpriced), and mushy brakes, though they work okay. Overall I'm very happy with the Forester, and so are many others considering the awards they've been picking up from the automotive press.  <br><br>
