            My 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier has been best the car I have ever owned.  Purchased as a program car with extremely low mileage.  Has been virtually maintenance free (with the exception of routine necessary maintenance).  I would wholeheartedly recommend this car and would probably purchase another.  A great car for the price range.  The only negative thing about this model (year) is that it does not have an airbag.  It does, however have anti lock brakes.  The only major problem I have had was with the electric system, which cost about $300 to fix.  I have experienced no other problems at all with this car.  I do believe that the 1993 Cavalier rated rather well with Consumer Reports for used cars.<br><br>
