            I recently purchased the Casio QV 3000EX to photograph a trip up the California, Oregon and Washington coasts.

The camera more than matched my expectations.  I am an artist and photographer so I need any digital camera to be very flexible in allowing me to choose the f-stop and shutter speed, so I can control the depth of field. I have waited to buy digital until now because they were too much like point & shoot with no flexibility.  The Casio allows you to choose the mode of shooting; program (f-stop and shutter speed chosen for you), aperature (you choose f-stop it chooses speed, shutter (you choose speed it chooses f-stop) and manual (you pick everything). It also has several other modes if you don't know an f-stop from a stop sign to help you get a quality photo. It even has an override feature by which you can increase or decrease exposure up to two stops in one-third stop increments with the effect being visible in the viewfinder.

The 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom gives you a 35mm equivalent range of 35-200. Unfortunately, the digital zoom is all or nothing, so you jump from 100mm to 200mm with nothing in between. This is the same as most digital cameras though still a disappointment. The range finder viewer also only works with the optical zoom and does not indicate what is in the frame when you are in digital zoom. The digital viewfinder does give you a through the lens perspective so it is only a drawback in very bright sunlight where the brighter than normal viewscreen is unreadable.  In comparing screen to Nikon 850, 880 & 950 it is MUCH brighter.

There are six choices of resolution: 2048x1536 Fine Normal or Economy and 1024x768 Fine Normal or Economy.  I used 2048x1536 Normal throughout my trip.  This gave me 44 shots on a 32MB Flash card with another 22 pictures to put on the 16MB card that comes with the camera. With Flash cards down to less than $1 per MEG it makes no sense not to add an extra Flash Card to your setup.  At this resolution I have been able to print (and sell) 11x14 prints using Adobe Photoshop to make the enlargement. (Photoshop is a MUST for working with digital pictures.)

Another nifty feature is the MPEG movie mode.  It allows you to record 30 seconds of action (without sound).  If you don't want to repeatedly video your son while he tries to get his first hit in Little League (the 30 sec clips eat up the memory) use the PAST VIDEO feature. With it you can wait until little Johnny gets the hit then press the shutter release and the Casio will capture the ten seconds of action which occurred just prior to pressing the button.  

Power, as in all digital cameras, can be a frustration.  Fortunately, it has an easy solution.  Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries last a long time (300+ lo res pics) recharge up to 1000 times and have no memory so you can charge them every night so they are always at full charge without ruining them.  I bought 8 AA's with a rapid (3 hour) charger that also works with the cigarette lighter in the car (less than $40 online) and never came close to running out of power.

The software to download the pictures is very easy to install and a no-brainer to use.  Merely plug the USB cable that comes with it into the computer and a dialog screen pops up and asks if you want to download picture from the camera.  Hit OK and all the pictures on the flash card are downloaded onto your computer organized in separate files by date the photo was taken.  You can also hook up the camera via serial cable (included) and show the photos on a TV with the included cable.

All in all a very good camera at a bargain price ($375 online) It has satisfied my needs (at least until an affordable digital SLR with interchangeable lenses and 10MB of resolution comes along).
