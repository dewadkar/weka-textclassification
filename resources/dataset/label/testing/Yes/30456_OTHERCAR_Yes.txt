            I have owned the 2000 VE Corolla for over a year now and I am tremendously satisfied.  I needed a car that gets good gas mileage and is reliable.  My Corolla regularly get 35 MPG and drives like a charm.

When buying the Corolla, I considered the Honda Civic as well.  I quickly opted for the Corolla when I realized that I could save $3000 dollars.

<b>Features I Love</b>

The interior of the Corolla is well designed.  You will find everything within easy reach.  I love the fact that the radio is installed in a much higher position which makes it easier to change stations or tapes.  The cup holder is retractable and works wonderfully.  The seats are comfortable and seem to support my back well.

I regularly get over 35 MPG with my Corolla.  Since gas prices have recently skyrocketed, I am glad that I did not purchase a Camry instead.

It includes child-safety tether locks for car seats which is a must have if you have children.  Car seats are much more secure with the tether strapped to the locks.

<b>Negatives</b>

The front is roomy for those six feet and under, but is not as spacious as others I've seen.  I am exactly six feet tall and the front is barely big enough to make me feel comfortable.  The front seat only retracts so far, so I suggest that if you are over six feet tall that you opt for a car with more room up front.

Acceleration in the Corolla is a bit sluggish, but drives nicely once it reaches the higher gears.  Be sure and get the 4-speed transmission as it is far superior to the 3-speed.

The three-year, 36,000 mile warranty ends rather quickly if you drive a lot.  Avoid the extended warranty as you'll probably never need it with this car.  The only reason Hyundai offers such great warranties is because the cars have such a bad reputation and image.  I do wish the factory warranty on the Corolla was longer though

<b>Final Thoughts</b>

The bottom line is that the Toyota Corolla and Toyota Camry are famous for their reliability and excellent resale value.  It may not be the most stylish car you've ever owned, but I guarantee it will not give you many headaches.  I would avoid the Ford Focus for a couple of years.  Every new model is great when it first comes out, but the true test of a new model is time.

Best of luck in your decision!
