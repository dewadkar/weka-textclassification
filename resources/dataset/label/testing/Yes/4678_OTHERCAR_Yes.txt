            I have a 1996 2-door Cavalier.  I bought it new and have loved every mile travelled in it!  I have not had a single mechanical problem with it.  I am diligent about getting the oil checked, so maybe that makes a difference.

For those of you with winter woes, this little car handles EXTREMELY WELL in bad weather.  The all weather tires do just fine in the upstate New York blizzards.  

The gas mileage is between 23-29 miles per gallon. Mine is 4 1/2 years old and already has 85K miles.  Yet, no unscheduled maintenance has been necessary.  Brake pads were replaced once.  

All Chevy's come with 24 hr roadside assistance, which is comforting to know even though I have been fortunate and have not needed it.

The only regret I have with my purchase was not ordering the car with power windows.  <br><br>
