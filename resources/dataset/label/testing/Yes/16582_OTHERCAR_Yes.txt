            After three years of yearning and researching, we were finally able to purchase the van of our dreams!  Truthfully, I never imagined at the age of 29 (I won't be 30 for another week) I would actually use the words "van of our dreams."  However, after trying in vain to place two strollers into the empty trunk of my Toyota Corolla so that my friend and our two children could go shopping, I knew I needed to do something.  

The truth is, my husband and I never considered the Mazda MPV until about a month before we purchased it.  Fortunately, someone tipped us off to its affordability and reliability, and of course I visited epinions to find out what past consumers thought, and suddenly we found ourselves test driving and loving this van.

First and foremost, I demanded a van that contained captains chairs in the second row.  Though I only have one child, I plan for more and I knew they might hate the idea of sitting side by side in a bench seat.  Not to mention, adults should not be forced to maneuver their bodies against the side of a bulky car seat.  However, a bench seat would offer the luxury of sitting next to a newborn and holding a bottle without having one's arm collapse.  The MPV offered the best option--  captains chairs that converted into a bench seat.  With a simple lift of a release, the chairs easily glide, allowing entrance and exit into the back of the van from the side, or allowing a split down the middle for easy access to the back from the front.

Second, the MPV offered something I have never seen (but always wondered about) in a minivan- -roll down rear windows.  One of the drawbacks of a van for me was always the fact that the passengers in the rear could never roll down the windows.  Now, the MPV allows them to do so.  And, the windows are large (as well as child proof).  What a luxury!

Third, many vans offer the ability to remove seats in order to make room for luggage, hauling, etc.  This is a wonderful idea, however, wouldn't it be nice to have the seats available when you arrive at your destination, and all of the luggage is put away?  Now, you can!  The MPV offers rear seats that fold into the floor.  This allows room for the luggage, and room for passengers when you arrive at the home you are visiting.

There are so many additional things that I could say about this van that are truly wonderful.  Ours is Rainforest green mica in color with a beige interior.  Though it is the middle of the line model, I have power everything, a CD player AND a cassette player (for my son's music), and alloy wheels that offer added security.  

I wouldn't feel right if I didn't offer insight into a few minor negatives of this van.  

First, the carpet is of poor quality.  We have only had this van for four months and it seems to be darkening in places that we never even set foot.  I definitely recommend purchasing (if they do not already come with the van as ours did) floor mats.  

Second, the driver side air-conditioning vans are blocked by the steering wheel.  There are some who would think this is a perk, actually, as it is impossible for the air to blow directly on the driver, however, I, myself, like the air directly on me and my passengers are forever yelling that it is too cold in the van.  Fortunately, if they were yelling that it was too hot, the rear passengers have their very own air-conditioner regulator.

Overall, this van is a hit with our family!  We all ride in comfort and style, and our guests feel the same way.  We no longer have to take two cars to the airport to pick up family that visits, and our son can take his wagon, bicycle, or even both with him when we go to his grandparent's homes.

We love this vehicle!
