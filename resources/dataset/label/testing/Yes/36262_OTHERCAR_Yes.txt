            I bought this car in May '98, and I'm generally still satisfied with it after 2 years and 38,000 miles.  My primary usage has been freeway driving, with the last several months consisting of roughly two hours a day in the car.  From this experience, I can say that the seats have been comfortable and road noise is pretty decent for an economy car.  Having a 5-speed, I am also truly impressed that with an average 37 mpg since buying my Corolla.

In addition, based on being an ex-mechanic who has done all of the maintenance, there's decent room to work around the engine and all routine services are quite easy to accomplish.  The new Corollas also using a timing chain, so you don't have to worry about expensive timing belt replacement.  Its also good to see that there's no evidence of oil leaks or other mechanical deterioration so far.  My only mechanical complaint is that my brake rotors are warped, despite my fairly tame driving style.  I have only had one warranty service done, replacement of the driver's airbag.  This made me nervous more than anything, its not too great to see your airbag light blinking at you all the time.

There are only a couple of persistent problems with this car, although neither has been too problematic.  First, I've started the car and had it die immediately three or so times.  I think the engine just accidentally floods itself though, so I am always able to get it started again if I wait 5-10 minutes.  The other issue for freeway drivers is that following a straight line is a little spooky in windy weather.  This may just be an alignment issue or something with my specific car, but I've heard it a few times and think people should watch out for it--but maybe the new Corollas don't have these issues.
