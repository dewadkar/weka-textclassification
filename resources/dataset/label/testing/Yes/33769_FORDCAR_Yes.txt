            The Bronco is one of the best 4X4's of all time.  It is durable, dependable, and versatile.  What other 4X4 do you mind actually taking out into the woods, climbing mountains, or fording streams with?  This vehicle has it all.  It the styling to look appropriate for a classy night out on the town, but when the weekend comes, look out!  Take the top off, load up the dogs, and pop in some of your favorite tunes.  In the summer, leave the top off.  Convertible tops are available, so you can just raise the canvas or vinyl canopy in the event of rainstorm.

I bought this vehicle for the ruggedness it offered and the fact that I wouldn't be afraid to get a scratch or two on the body.  There are just a couple of things that I don't like about it.  First, the bushings on the front end don't last forever.  When they wear out, sever bumps can cause severe shimmying which you must stop the vehicle for in order to stop the shimmying.  This can lead to excessive wear on the axle shafts in the rear end.  On the flip side of that, the kit to replace the bushings doesn't cost over $30.00.  Secondly, the steering can get a little loose as the years go by.  My '78 was very loose, but I was used to it.  Keep in mind that it was also 20 years old.

Driving this vehicle is great.  You are raised higher than most traffic around you, you have a real feeling of security, and the power is terrific.  I have use mine to move, haul firewood, haul hay, carry 10 people at a time with a couple cases of beer, transport injured animals to and from the vet's office, and deliver presents to a bunch of needy children at Christmas.  The list goes on and on.  I still mourn the loss of my Bronco from the summer of '99.

Who should buy this vehicle?  Anyone who wants to feel tough.  A man should definitely own this vehicle, because it provides more of a sense of masculinity than say a Nissan or a Saturn.  Women should definitely own this vehicle, because one of the most sexy things is to see a good looking woman driving a vehicle that was made for getting dirty.  Hunters should definitely own this vehicle with no explanation offered.  O.J. Simpson should never own one again.  If you'll notice around you, you don't see very many used ones for sale.  People are keeping them, because they know the value of a good truck.<br><br>
