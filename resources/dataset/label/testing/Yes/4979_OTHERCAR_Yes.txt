            I bought my CS August 1994 new and paid 17,000.  I got the 8-passenger, no frills except the power door locks, cruise control and air conditioning.  We have had children and foster children use and abuse this vehicle for eight years and it has taken it well.  We travel long-distance extensively, go camping, do home improvement (you can put several 4'x8' sheets of plywood or sheet rock INSIDE the van, or even 10' 2x4's with the doors closed!) and pull boats and trailers and this van has done it all without so much as a hic-cup.  Other than regular oil changes and running 93-octane gas, I've done little or no maintenance to the vehicle and it still starts flawlessly in all weathers, runs great and seems like it could keep going for another 150,000.  I love the dead-on cruise control and the up-above-traffic view you get from this van.  The only two problems are 1) some of the electrical components seem to have been low-bidded: the headlamp switch has been flakey, the windshield wiper motor ground was faulty, the power door locks (wiring: NOT the switches, actuators, or circuit boards) have failed, and 2) the doors have given us problems.  The sliding door developed a problem (probably from being slammed too hard) where it now won't engage the second catch, although it stays closed on the first catch.  The driver's window channel lost it's spot weld to the inside of the door, which resulted in the channel guide falling down inside the door and jamming the ability to open the door with the window down.  And, the rear doors won't open.  They're locked and the cylinder has long been corroded solid.  The power locks won't unlock them and Chevrolet decided to put no other means for unlocking the rear doors.  Also, after 8 years, the air conditioner finally gave up the ghost and was a little anemic last summer.  Probably needs a good cleaning and servicing, but usually fetches between $350 and $500 in these parts.  We can live with the heat for a few months.
