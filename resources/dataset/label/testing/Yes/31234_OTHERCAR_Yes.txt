            I bought my 1995 Grand Am four door SE with 41,184 miles on it in late 1999.

 As far as reliability is concerned this car has been very good. Only expense I have made besides customizing and basic maintenance is a muffler hanger. A $40.00 job. 

My car has the 2.3L "Quad Four" DOHC engine. I now have roughly 74,000 miles on it and this car has been great. I have modified the engine, adding a balance under drive crank pulley (which really added  a lot of torque to keep up with the V6's out there), cold air induction, performance spark plugs, and an inline computer chip that connects to the throttle body. Performing many effects, one of which is advancing the timing 6 degrees. The engine is producing roughly 190 horsepower, and 195-200 ft-lbs of torque. The drivetrain and linkage has stood up to the extra power with no problem. The car is also equipped with a four speed automatic transmission. The engine is smooth, and efficient. I average about 27 mpg. Very good drivetrain indeed.

The suspension does it's job, but not always well. The only thing I've added is bigger end links on the anti-sway bar, with stiffer bushings. The car handles not only surprisingly well, but VERY well. Before I added the better end links, 90 degree turns any faster than a typical driver would drive created severe understeer. Highway driving is fantastic! Confidence is very high at highway speeds. Maneuvering is no problem. Big dips are handled well, not perfectly, but well. The biggest thing I have to complain about this car is the way it handles little bumps. Whether it be "wash-boards" on gravel roads, or large cracks in the asphalt that have been filled a little high. These tend to send a sometimes violent shock throughout the car. However, they have never shifted the rear from side to side at all. Despite the intensity, the car maintains it's balance. Also as I have discovered, the suspension and frame are very sturdy. If you don't see that big pot-hole ahead and happen to hit it. It may not feel real good, but the car does stand up against it. 

The interior is nice, and comfortable, but closer inspection reveals a lack in quality and money spent. Seats are very comfortable, and the pros far outweigh the cons. But they ARE very thinly padded. They also could use more lateral support if you plan on taking any quick corners. Room is quite good. I am 6'3" and I have yet to cramp up from a long trip. I don't think 5 adults would ride comfortably, but 4 certainly would.  Typical drivers will find them very pleasing. Displays and controls are well done, and very readable at day or night. Some have complained about the gas gage, but I have had no problems concerning it. Climate control works very well. I have no complaints about it with the exception of maybe more climate control options. But there are enough to keep most happy. If you buy this car, you're obviously not expecting all the extras you'd find in a Cadilac. Power windows are reliable, but move very slow. They also groan as if they are tired. Not all four arrive at their destination at the same time either. A small price to pay if you love your power windows as I do. All in all, they do function, and get the job done. The outside view from in the car is also very good. Backing up is not a problem. Trunk space is also adequate. My car is equipped with fold down rear seats, which makes hauling things a breeze. The only problem is sometimes very long objects must be loaded from inside the car. Also, the gas door gets stuck open on occasion. As if the cable freezes up. Many times it takes a little tinkering. My trick is to pull hard on the lever, and let it snap back into position.

Body and paint is excellent! I have nothing to complain about with these. I have seen no traces of rust, and it has fiberglass in all the right places to protect against rock chips and rust. The paint has remained shinny and bold. 

Overall a very good buy for what you get. A very well rounded car, for someone who wants a little of it all, without the hefty price tag.
