             I wanted a digital camera I could take along. I have this camera with me all the time, it fits in my coat pocket or hip pocket, and the lens is protected. A great camera is no good if you don't have it with you when you have the opportunity for a great photo. The Fuji looked promising, with a longer telephoto range and even more portability, but it looks as if the resolution is not anywhere near as high as the Canon.

I was concerned about the color and flash, based on reviews of the Canon S10. As far as the flash goes, my indoor pictures seem fine: all digital cameras seem to make subjects a bit "grey" in color with the flash and the Canon is no exception, but it does not seem any worse than others and overall I have been pleased with indoor flash shots. I have not noted excessive blurring, only on rare occasions is there a blurred "ghost" image. The flash is a bit underpowered: beyond about 10 feet the illumination drops off substantially, so for example when the waiter is taking a picture of the table, you have to ask him to get a bit closer.

I also worried about color balance; I had heard complaints about magenta coloration in blues. I have not personally noticed this; sometimes I think that digicam hobbists are a little crazy looking at color balance under the microscope...the important thing is how the pictures look and to me they look fine, with good color saturation and pleasing color balance on the monitor. I have not been motivated to adjust the color of the blue sky in manipulation software programs. 

Compared to the S10, the telephoto end of the zoom has been reduced (did they use the same lens for a larger chip, resulting in a shorter wide angle and telephoto?) so that it is not quite long enough for good portraits. That would be one of my only complaints about the camera. Also there is some pincushion distortion, compared to the Nikon Coolpix lens, if you are into shooting paper photographs on a copy stand or projects like that. 

I see complaints about charging separately for the required battery. As far as I am concerned this business decision is up to Canon; I don't think anyone will buy this camera without the rechargeable battery, and it is not hard to add $100 dollars to the price in your head to figure out what it really costs. Maybe they hope that, in addition to making the camera sound less expensive than it is, that people will be more likely to upgrade in the future to Canon products that use the same battery. Would they have sold fewer cameras if they bundled everything for $900? If so, then they made a good corporate decision. I hope no one buys the camera without the rechargable battery, though; that would be rediculous.

It works well and I have gotten a month of good pictures now. As others have mentioned, the software including the panorama modes is excellent. The 3 megapixel resolution is fantastic and leaves room for cropping.
