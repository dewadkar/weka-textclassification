            When we discovered this summer that we would be adding a new baby to our family of 4, we immediately traded up to a mini-van.  Having owned Chevrolets in the past, there was no question that we would continue the tradition by purchasing the Chevy Venture.

While I was a big nervous about driving a bigger and higher car, I soon learned that the Venture drives just like a sedan -- none of that &quot;truck&quot; feeling that I feared.  It is surprisingly maneuverable, handles beautifully and provides a quiet, smooth drive.

Among its many conveniences....interior lights that come on and fade off whenever you enter or exit the car in the evening.  This is a lifesaver when trying to maneuver a family into a vehicle.  The headlights automatically turn on and off (great for busy moms who may forget this step!) The remote door lock is handy as well.  The venture seats seven, accommodates a carseat of any size wonderfully, and each passenger has room for their own beverage.  There is ample legroom, even in the back and the Venture &quot;sits&quot; at the perfect height for loading kids in and out of the car.  Our 5 year old can climb in with ease, and putting my toddler into his carseat while pregnant has been blissfully easy.  While we didn't buy a &quot;loaded&quot; model, we did opt for the CD player which is great for entertaining the kids.

The &quot;trunk&quot; space in the back could be more ample...we are a bit concerned about losing cargo space once we have 2 carseats and a preschooler in the car.  But when necessary, the seats fold and come out with ease.

Features we wish we would have sprung for??  Passenger doors on BOTH sides of the van.  It seemed like an unnecessary expense at the time (and it is a rather costly addition), but we realize now, that especially with small children, the 2nd door is almost a requisite.  The automatic door would be a nice feature as well, but we don't feel like we missed out by not opting for this feature.

This van is well designed and a good value.  We were hesitant about becoming minivan owners, but the Chevy Venture makes us feel confident about our decision.
