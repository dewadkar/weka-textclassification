            I was used to driving &quot;junkers&quot; for most of my life.  I had owned an '89 Chevy Blazer for a year, and had become used to the feel of an SUV, but I was tired of the poor gas mileage and performance.  I had seen the commercials for the Kia Sephia, and decided to attempt the switch back to a car.  After the test drive, I found myself needing something else, and ended up trying out the Kia Sportage.  Impressive from the start.  The Sportage has the feel that most SUVs give, without the ungodly cumbersome size of something like a Ford Explorer.  The interior is very spacious, which you can really only appreciate once you sit inside.  There is a &quot;power&quot; button that gives a sportier (sp?) ride, basically meaning that the transmission performs differently.  I have found from my experience that the &quot;power&quot; mode is best kept on, one-because the gas mileage appears to be negligible, and two-there is a noticeable power change.  Keep in mind the Sportage sports a 4cyl engine, not making it an extremely fast vehicle, but it holds its own on the highway.  Other minor problems I have are as follows:  the vehicle seems to be a little &quot;light,&quot; making a drive on the highway with a stiff wind kind of an adventure because the vehicle likes to sway a little; and the rear wheel connection to the tailgate doesn't always catch when you try to connect it.  Other than those things, everything else is great; gas mileage is above average for an SUV, the stereo is very nice, the seats are comfortable (especially with the adjustable arm rest), and the four wheel drive option is a must have here in Wisconsin.  And best of all, the Kia Sportage is a great looking vehicle, I've already had over four complete strangers ask me about it!  If you live and breath and can't afford a car over $20,000, I would try out the Sportage. <br><br>
