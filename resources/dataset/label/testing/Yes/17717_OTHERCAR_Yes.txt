            WOW!! is all I can say about this vehicle.  We just bought one yesterday and I am just truely amazed at all the great features saturn has to offer!
We took a test drive and you just would not believe what our salesperson did and had us do to test out this vehicle!  I have never had such an experience with test drives.  Normally its all about jumping into the car, maybe putting around town and the freeway and then its &quot;do you want the car?&quot; Well our salesperson took us out on a country road, basically showed us what the car could do---take hairpin turns at 50mph and not even skid or move from your lane, get up to 60mph and then lock the brakes and the car didnt even fishtail on both dirt and pavement and many more, but these are the ones that stuck in my mind.  He then had us test drive the vehicle the same way he had just shown us and all I can say is AMAZING!!!
and then it was off to the showroom to show us all the engine features, body features and interior features--wow! saturn has really outdone itself.
I have never found myself to be overwhelmed by a vehicle, but all I can say is I truely love my new car--from bumper to bumper!!
If you havent taken the time to check one of these out, you just dont know what you are missing--get a saturn!!
