            I have now put over 45000 worry free miles on my EX CRV. I have had absolutely no problems what so ever.  My only real complaint is the lack of power from the engine. However, I still feel at the time of purchase it is the overall best mini-SUV on the market. 
The CRV seems small and nimble when driving, but it seems to have more cargo space than larger SUV�s. Basically the CRV feels like driving a tall Civic. I got the EX package which includes CD, Alloy wheels, keyless entry, and more rear seat movement options. For comparisons sake I will also tell a little bit about the other SUVs I looked before I purchased my CRV.

Toyota Rav4 - Inside passenger and cargo space much smaller. Price similar. I personally think the view from the rear is absolutely ugly. (But that�s just my opinion)

Subaru Forester - Lower ground clearance, higher price, had reliability problems with other Subaru models in the past. Also I did not like brake feel.

Kia Sportage - Materials used in the seats and dash seemed cheap. Of course the SUV is less expensive than the CRV but the cheapness shows. 

Nissan X-Tera - More expensive, uses a truck frame, drives like a truck.

Back to the CRV-

I love the following features of the CRV: handles and rides like a car, gets better gas mileage than other SUVs, all wheel drive system works when you need it, great visibility, and of course the picnic table.

Now after owning this car for over 2 years, here are my gripes. There is considerable road noise when driving at highway speeds, especially if you drive over 65mph. Most of the road noise it seems is due to the tires. I am almost ready to buy new tires and I will not be buying the BF Goodrich TA�s that were standard. Maybe this will bring down the noise level.  Also the cruise control is not adequate enough to handle hills. It seems the engine can�t get enough fuel when trying to go up even small hills and the engine will kick down to a lower gear.  When cruise control is not engaged I can travel up the same small inclines without having to drop down a gear. However, the CRV doesn�t really shine on inclines at all due to its underpowered engine.  1999 and later CRVs do have additional horsepower. Also added in 1999 is a passenger side armrest, which 1998 and earlier models sadly lack.  However, you can get after-market kits that will allow you to add a passenger side armrest.

Overall I am very pleased with my CRV. If it only had about 25 or 50 more horsepower the vehicle would be perfect.
