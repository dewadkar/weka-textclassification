            My 1991 Ford Escort was my first &quot;real&quot; car.  I bought it over four years ago and still have it.  That thing just keeps on going forever!  I have owned other cars since and drive a Jeep now, but I will keep my Escort until it goes to the junk yard heaven.  It's not the smoothest ride and the interior is somewhat small but the gas mileage is great.  And if you need to haul something, the hatch is perfect!!!  No one with more than two kids should buy this vehicle.  Or anyone with a Great Dane---they don't fit!!!  We tried to put him in the back but he didn't fit!  This car would be perfect for a single parent as it is very affordable in every aspect.<br><br>
