            I had my eye on a Liberty since August of 2002, and finally got mine in November of 2002. I have almost 6,000 miles on it, and have had no problems that I am aware of yet.  I can only speak for the loaded Liberty models, as if you buy a base Liberty without any options or value option packages(27G), than maybe you can find something better or might not think the Liberty is too special.

The exterior(especially the front end) attracted me to the Liberty at first, and then the two tone tan and black interior with the silver trim and all the factory options you get with the 27G value package hooked me for good.  I have also added alot of accessories to my Liberty to help improve its appearance and performance.

The Liberty is a joy to drive and as smooth as can be for a off-road class suv.  I found the front seats very comfortable and have a great high sight line of the road.  The acceleration from a dead stop is slow, but this is a 4000 pound suv we are trying to move.  The gas mileage is the only real downer with the Liberty for me.  I get about 15 to 18 mpg so far, and in the cold winter months it pretty much stays around 15 mpg.  The sticker touted 17-21 mpg, and I am still hoping to see 17 mpg year around some day.

If you want a good looking 4x4 MID-SIZE SUV that can go off road and handle bad weather conditions, as well as perform very nice on the paved road, the Liberty with all its factory options and after-market accessories is hard to beat.
