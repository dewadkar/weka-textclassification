            After much car shopping I decided on the Suzuki Aerio SX, a hatchback model car that seems remarkably small on the outside but is in reality quite roomy on the inside. Even my dad and my fiance, with their long legs had room to spare sitting in both front and back seats, not to mention the generous head room above. 

This car gets great gas mileage: 28/31 and it's very affordable to fill it up for the week. I believe it holds a maximum of 13 gallons, and those 13 gallons seem to last quite a while as far as I'm concerned.

My favorite features are the car's sportiness--it is fun to drive and I've received nothing but compliments on its appearance. I didn't think I'd appreciate the 6-CD changer as much as I do now; it certainly makes long road trips easier. There is a lot of storage in the back, with compartments neatly hidden away. There's also a built-in ice box which I did use once and kept my drinks very cold.

My least favorite features are the car's lack of armrests and sufficient lighting in the trunk space. It's pretty dark back there! It also took me awhile to get used to the 4-cylinders the car offers when I was used to a V-6. My mother isn't crazy about the seats. They are pretty solid and unconforming to the body, unlike the super-plush seats the more expensive cars boast. 

But all in all, it's a great car and if I had to do it all over again, I'd make the same choice. Though I might get it in the bright yellow instead!
