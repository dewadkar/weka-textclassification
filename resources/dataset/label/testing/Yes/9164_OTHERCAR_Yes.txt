            I have owned my RAV-4 for 32 months now.  I bought the truck as a delivery vehicle of sorts.  I am an automotive artist, and my clients are scattered between Florida and Washington state.  I live in the middle in Phoenix, AZ.
I am constantly on the road at art shows, delivering art to clients and picking up supplies.  My RAV-4 has just turned over 90,000 miles and is in the same shape it was in when I picked it up from the Toyota Dealer!!

The factory issue tires(Bridgestone)wore out at 21,000 miles and were replaced with Michelin MXV4 in a slightly bigger size than stock (235/60-16) These tires have approximately 5-8000 miles left on them and have proven to be very economical. The Michelin tires also have had a much quieter ride than orig. equip tires.  I have experienced this with a number of other Japanese cars I have owned. I just put another set of 
Michelins on the truck at 72,500 which I think is pretty good tire mileage.  Again, rotating religiously is the key.

Total maintenance to date has been tires at 21,000 mi, front brake pads (installed myself) at 30,000 mi, and spark plugs, dist. cap and rotor at 40,000 mi.  I have changed oil and filter religiously at 4000 mile intervals and the air filters at 15,000 mile intervals.  Tires are rotated every 5-7500 miles.  The only defect so far was a front suspension strut bolt that came loose at 59,900 miles which was not covered under the warranty and cost 35 dollars to repair.  I have still 
not needed rear brakes yet at 90 thousand miles!  I do a lot of freeway
driving, but this is amazing! My last review of this truck was at 70K
miles, and I have only done a full scheduled maintenance at 75K(timing belt, adjust valves, etc for about 400 dollars at the dealer).  This has
been it.  The RAV is still as dependable as a microwave oven.

My RAV is the front wheel drive, manual transmission model. Being in Arizona, the A/C is on almost all the time so my gas mileage figures might be a bit lower than others.  I get about 26mpg in town and about 23mpg on the fwy. If I am on a long trip and really have the pedal down (80 mph +) the mileage will dip below 20.

Again, the car seems very well built.  My other cars include two Porsches, a VW Cabrio and a Mercedes 300E, so my standards are fairly high.

My only complaints are that I wish the car had just a bit more power for long trips and was just a bit quieter inside.  

One of the greatest features of this truck is the rear seats come out with a wrench easily (13mm bolts) and you can even pop the front out if you need to carry something really long. I am still amazed at how much stuff I can pack in this little truck!!

I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone that is looking for a moderately priced mini sport utility truck.  Compared to the Honda CRV, it is much better built.  I have a few friends and clients that own these, and after about 20K miles they are already starting to squeak and rattle.  The RAV is very solid.  <br><br>
