            If you need a very dependable vehicle, the Toyota 4Runner is the one for you.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  My husband and I bought a used 4Runner (1990) for the purpose of using it for his work. He drives a lot and uses it on construction sites which can be very rough on any vehicle. 

When we bought it, there was 90,000 miles on it...quite a bit, but he only intended to use it for work and didn't want anything new or too expensive.  Well, we use it for everything now.  We have now had our 4Runner for 4 years and it is still running like a top. We have only had to do routine maintenance on it and replace the tires. 

Another great thing about the 4Runner is that it is very economical on gas..a wonderful plus, and it drives great...very smooth.  It seats 5 comfortably, and has plenty of room in the storage area to carry just about anything.  It also has a lot of pockets to put your maps and anything else you might carry in your car. This comes in handy if you have kids, there are two of these behind the front seats that they can put all their fun things in when traveling.

One of the best features is a backseat heater, which is controlled by the backseat passengers. This is great because the frontseat passengers do not have to roast while the people in the backseat freeze...a definite plus in my book. 

I would definitely recommend the Toyota 4Runner...you will not be disappointed.
