              I bought my Protege in 1999 it had 120,000 miles on it. It now has over 150,000 and I have not had any major problems. Just front struts and a half shaft. Other than that nothing. Car is very reliable and cheap to maintain. I have the DX model, no frills on this one. No power anything. I like this in a way, I don't worry about the windows getting stuck open or closed. The handles always work. It took me some time to get used to sitting so low to the ground, I usually drive a truck. The stereo isn't much to brag about. I had to replace all 4 speakers because the ones that were in it were dry rotted to the point they sounded like a piece of paper stuck in a fan. Now the radio/cassette player is starting to short in and out.
  

  I bought this car because I needed something cheap to get back and forth to work. This car does an excellent job of doing this. The only time it broke down on me was the fuel line freeze up. 


  The thing I love about the car is that it seems to be well built and you can rely on it to get you there. I drive this car on several road trips a year with my daughters gymnastics team and my drive to work everyday is a 40 mile round trip. It just keeps on going. I'm getting ready to give it to my 16 year old son. Now we'll see how well this thing is built huh.

  The only thing I hate about this car is the automatic safety belts. I have been choked, pinched and the thing never  wants to go back to the off position when you get out of the car, but when you are getting in, there it goes. Make sure the passenger belt is locked in before take off, I've had mine pin people in where they couldn't move. And it wasn't easy getting them out once it got so tight.   

UPDATE per request;
 The front bucket seats are comfortable for everyday driving. Long trips they do get tiring, no lumbar support. Back seats, I'll have to ask one of my kids. Well they say not as comfortable as our Jeep, that has leather seats. The breaks are discs in the front and drum in the back. They're adequate for what I do. I'm not on the race track. Has rack and pinion steering which is nice and independent rear suspension that makes it handle well around curves. The engine is very peppy, passing is not a problem with the DOHC engine. Transmission is a 4 speed automatic with overdrive. Transmission is starting to shift hard between 1st and 2nd. Other than this no problems. Trunk space is plenty for a car this size. The rear seats fold down so you can get quite large items in. Controls are easily access able and easy to understand. Not many of them.    

 The body on my Protege is rust free. It my have had some rust proofing before I got it, because I have seen other Proteges around that were rusting. Interior is in great shape, considering how old the car is. No cracks in the dashboard or discoloring. Cloth interior seats don't have tears, just a few stains from kids. Gas mileage I just don't know. I've never checked. It's definitely better than the 1979 Pontiac I had before this car. It got 12 miles a gallon. I'd say the Protege gets at least twice that.
  All the parts are mechanically sound. Valve cover gasket needs replaced, which on my to do list. Changing plugs is a breeze, air filter is also easy to get to. Changing the oil filter is a bit of a problem. I had to get one of the wrenches that goes on a ratchet since the filter is hard to reach.
