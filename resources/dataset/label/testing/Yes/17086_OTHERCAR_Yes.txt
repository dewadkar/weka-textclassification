            Ever since this product was introduced, people have made a habit of slamming it. I often wonder whether they refer to the same vehicle that I have been driving since 1999, because my experience is utterly different. Don't get me wrong, I don't doubt the lemon stories - but I test rode the heck out of the car, I bought it, and it's been rock-solid ever since. Only problem ever was a rattle from the sunroof that was promptly fixed during regular service. I might have been lucky. 

This refers to a 1999 ML320 that was bought in July 1999 as a second car, but actually worked its way up to everyday car. It's got 45k troublefree miles on it, and feels utterly solid and looks new. It came loaded with all the premium bits - leather, sunroof, privacy glass, premium stereo etc etc. 

So I have already said I have experienced absolutely none of the unreliability stories with this car (knock on wood). I am also surprised about the way the press criticizes the interior. I'd agree the 1999 model is spartan, but that was the philosophy when the car came out - make it a bit more rugged and utilitarian. But I find the interior quite tastefully done in its somewhat spartan simplicity; and if it's gobs of wood you like, the aftermarket offers plenty of ways to load it up. Personally, I am not a big wood fan. Because, other than that, the ML's interior ranks very highly in my humble opinion. I like it quite a bit (and I have owned 2 premium Jaguars...): The seats, front and back, are extremely comfortable for me. Among the best. I've driven this car for 12 hours non stop without any fatigue. The only thing missing in the '99 was seat memory. Then, the interior is so open and full of light thanks to the huge windows surrounding you - it's nearly an airier feeling than sitting in my convertible. There is nothing non-functional in the interior - the dials and controls are very readable, well arranged and make sense (no NAV options here).  There is some hard plastic here and there, but be aware this is a budget Benz. Later models have long upgraded the interior over my '99 model, but I am not sure if it makes that much of a difference to me. 

But it's driving this car that shows the competence of the package. Silky smooth it isn't - buy a sedan if that's what you are after. But it does drive smoothly enough on the road, and doing 80mph+ on the highway is utterly upper middleclass car like - the ML320 cruises very well.

The 6-cyl engine to me is better that the 8-cyl for this car. Fuel economy, for one. The 6 cyl is not exactly efficient, but the 8 cyl is obscene. And the power difference is not *that* huge. The 320's engine provides sufficient pop when needed - it spins up well. It might sound somewhat strained in such a large car, but it does propel this car around plenty well enough. Also, the 8 cyl comes with an overall stiffening of the chassis that to me makes this a far less balanced car. The softer sprung 320 seems to simply work better on real world roads, and reviewers claim it is a far more capable off-road vehicle in this version.

As to handling and such: a sports car it obviously isn't, but I am surprised at how much it can be pushed - far more than 90% of the owners would ever feel comfortable with. Take a highway ramp very aggressively, and the body rolls... but then stiffens well, and the car just drives nice through the turn - quite an experience with the high seating position! :-) The suspension of the ML320 is not luxury sedan like - but then again, it is comfortable enough. Very impressive, it does truly defy its size when in motion. And off the line.

I am not letting this car off easy, I've never had a problem letting go of stuff that does not quite convince me: This car has competed against very competent machinery in my garage for my day to day favor, but I found it works great on real world California roads. It is fast enough to dart in and out of traffic gaps when commuting, it accelerates and brakes with (good) car-like authority, and has what I think is a nicely tuned chassis. It offers a cavernous interior for transport when you need it, it offers a lot of space to keep people comfortable in long distance rides, it is rated as a very safe car in all collision tests...

It does work great for me. Call me lucky. One day, I'd buy another one, but for now this one still feels just like new.
