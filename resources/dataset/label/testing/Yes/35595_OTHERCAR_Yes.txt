            My wife and I just happened across this little beast one day, and it's looks really caught our eyes!  There wasn't a ZR2 on the lot at the time, so we test drove one of the 4-bangers, and I must say that I was impressed.  Once we started talking with the dealer, we found out about the ZR2, and decided that that was the model for us.  The first major selling factor was that we got a $3,300 rebate on the darn thing!  Then we realized that we could get it with a V6 engine, whereas the CR-V we were considering didn't come with one.  Anyway, when we finally were able to drive the ZR2, I was even more impressed!  This little mean machine has got some guts!  Okay, so what do I like about it?  
1)The price was reasonable (after the rebate); 2)V6; 3)It can actually store quite a bit.  I am continuously surprised by how much we can manage to fit in it.  Of course, my wife is the packing queen.  4)Sound system is kick-butt for a stock system!  I was going to replace it with an after market system, but now I'll just save my money for a while longer.  5)Looks--come on, everybody wants a car for its looks... Last but not least: ABS.  We paid the extra $$ and got them, and I tell you, I'll never get a vehicle without them ever again!

The biggest disappointment, however, is the gas mileage.  For this vehicle being a Suzuki, I would expect better gas mileage; but, since Chevy's name is on it, it's got to be a guzzler, right?  It could be worse though.  I figure that I'm getting about 21 or 22 mpg for highway driving (which is pretty much all we do.)  the other thing that ticked me off was that it didn't come standard with a CD player--all of the 2002 models do though!  They wanted to charge me an extra $100 to put in a CD player!  Forget that noise--I can do it myself for cheaper!

Well, that's my review in a nutshell.  If I forgot anything, I'll come back and add it.  I hope this was informative enough for you.  I recommend this little beast to anyone who's looking to drive something fun, strong, and good looking.
