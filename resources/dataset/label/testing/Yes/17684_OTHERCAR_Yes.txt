            My Saturn is a 2000, but it is brand new to me!   I have wanted to own a Saturn since I first saw them when they opened the plant in my native state of Tennessee.  When we moved to Canada I needed a new car because my current Ford would not pass the rather stringent saftey requirements here, so rather than put a bunch of money in an 8 year old car, I started shopping around.

The Saturn dealership here is awesome, the sales people were friendly, but NOT pushy, I like that.  They came out to me on the lot, told me to look around and they would be there to answer any questions we might have, with that they backed off and let me look. When I found the car I was interested in, I was allowed to take it for a 2 hour test drive, even to take it to my husbands work place so he could see if liked it too!  No where that I have shopped for a car has let me do that!

Once hubby approved my choice (and even complimented me on it) I was back to the dealership to work out the money details.  The financing was also painless and not very time consuming.

The SLI that I got has:

Automatic Transmission
Power Windows
Power Doors
AC
CD Player
Keyless entry - which also opens the trunk
Panic Button
Inside Trunk Release
Inside Fuel Door Release
Automatic Running Lights

Now I was lucky in that this was a one owner lease vehicle that had less than 30,000 kilometers which is less than 15,000 actual miles.  It even has the new car smell still!  The Manufacturers Warranty was still effective and I purchased the extended plan.

Driving this car is a dream.  The engine is so quiet that I have to look at the dash sometimes to make sure that it is running!  The only thing I wish I had done was get one with Cruise Control since I drive from Canada to Mississippi at least 7 times a year!  The braking system is not ABS but they are smooth, and I have yacked them a couple of times to stop quickly and have not had them lock up on me.  The car handles excellently, cornering is awesome in this vehicle as it feels like it is glued to the road as it handles even the sharpest curve as if it were nothing but a small bend!

Gas Mileage is superior, before I got the Saturn I was using up to $70.00 in gas a week, so far I am hard put to empty this tank in a week even when making a 45 mile round trip twice a day to and from work and the usuall running around.

A week after I got the car, I got a recall notice (which freaked me out) but I called the dealership and was in the next day and the repair only took 15 minutes.

Now lets talk about the bumper problem.  I did not know that the Saturn was entirely fiberglass (hubby did) and you have to be carefull of parking stops because they can cause the bumper to come loose and it has to be fixed by the dealership or a qualified body shop.  I had parked my car while waiting for my husband, when I parked I did not hear any dragging but when I backed out with hubby in the passenger seat, I did drag the parking stop and dislodged the bumper on the right side.  So I called the dealership, the mechanic knew exactly what I had done and how (before I told him) this was not covered under the bumper to bumper warranty but he told me to bring it in and they would fix it this time and I would know not to pull over parking stops with my hefty hubby! LOL

The only thing I can complain about other than that is the small back seat area.  This is fine for trips around town, but my 10 year old is the size of a grown man and he is already complaining that there is not enough room for him back there on long trips...Since I financed for 5 years he will have to get over it, but a little more legroom would be nice.

All in all I would recommend this car to anyone and I have already picked out my next Saturn, A Vue!!!
