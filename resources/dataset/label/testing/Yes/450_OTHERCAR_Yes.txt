            I Bought my parents 93 mazda protege a few months ago. It has been exteamly valuable and very cheap to run. The car did not cost me a ton of money, and does not cost me a whole lot to keep it on the road. I use it to commute between the two campus at the college that i go to. Plus I use it to go to work. This car has also made many trips from Maine to Mass...and also Maine to Penn. I have not once had a problem with this car. It runs smooth and is good on gas. I reccomend it to any college student who wants a reliable car.<br><br>
