                This review is intended to discuss a few reasons why you should buy a digital camera, and this one specifically.  Since the other reviews have covered this camera in more detail I will hit only the highlights.

<b> Why Digital? </b>
     I still have a few friends who have 35mm cameras.  Since I made the switch 1 1/2 years ago I am a solid convert.  There are three major reasons.  
     1) <b> Digital Film. </b>   The great thing about digital film is the small size and versatility.  On a single card you can have 50, 100 even 500 or more pictures.  There are cards that will soon take 1000's of high quality pictures.  And the cards are so small you could keep a half dozen in you shirt pocket.
     2) <b> Digital Processing </b> I love the convenience of not having to schlep to develop film and I dont miss the expense of buying it and processing.  I hook up the camera to the computer transfer the pictures to the hard drive.  So easy.  In the long run you'll save money too. 
     3) <b> Digital Printing </b>  Imagine that your mother wants a copy of that picture before she leaves the party.  Done.  With a good printer and some photopaper (definitely startup costs - though cheaper in the long run) your mom leaves happy. Or emailing pictures of the party that night to your relatives or friends.  Then theres the ability to digitally manipulate pictures and make pictures CD's for you computer, etc.. if you know how.
     By the way with a good camera, 3 megapixels or more, its hard to distinguish digital photos from regular ones.  With the right printer (like this one <a href="/content_99203649156">http://www.epinions.com/content_99203649156</a> ) you can easily print frameable photos.  
     <b> TIP: </b> Any loss of quality vs 35mm film is the printer not the camera and to a lesser extent the Photo Paper you buy.  (I used to use the Epson Photo Paper.  When I switched to the Kodak Ultimate Photo Paper -- Sam's club: $25 for 75 sheets -- not cheap -- I cannot tell you how much better my photos came out.)  But, if you get professional reprints available through the web you will not notice the difference.


<b> Why Not Digital? </b>
     1) Digital Cameras, like many digital devices, eat batteries.  Even the cameras with rechargeables dont last long. 
     2) There are many confusing and competing memory card standards 
     3) Some computer knowledge is necessary to maximize the potential of digital photography.
     4) Digital cameras typically have a "shutter lag time" meaning there s delay between pictures.
     5) Finally with the purchase of a digital camera, printer, memory card and printer paper theres high startup costs to worry about.


<b> Why This Camera </b>
     1.  This camera is easy to use
     2.  Takes great quality pictures (3.2 megapixels - more than enough)
     3.  Uses the most standard, lowest priced memory cards
     4.  Takes 3 kinds of batteries - regular off the shelf rechargeables or alkalines (cheapest solution); camera specific rechargeable (optional add-on); and lithium ion one time use.  These are expensive ($10 a peice) but you can take between 150-200 flash photos so in certain situations a great option.
     5.  Nicely priced at $350.
     6.  This camera also has a "movie mode" which allows you to take short 45 second soundless movies of a lower quality than the pictures but this can be very useful in a pinch because sometimes you can convey more with a short moving picture than with many still pictures.

     On the negative side the camera has a two or so second shutter lag time (though this is somewhat memory card dependent so you can get a faster memory card.) and the memory card included (and this is with all digital cameras) is woefully small.

     <b> TIP: </b> A friend of mine who owns this camera was complaining that his camera took a few seconds to take the picture once he pressed the button.  He was frustrated because the pictures he wanted had moved by the time the camera snapped the pic.  This is NOT shutter lag time as I understand it.  This camera can take instant pictures.  His problem was the RED EYE REDUCER was activated (it can be turned off - see the manual) and the flash flickers three times before the picture is taken.  The shutter lag time that I refer to is the time BETWEEN pictures.

     A last note: get the purchase protection plan.  Like all digital items they're fragile and wont survive being dropped.  And get the case, they're $9 and a memory card upgrade.
