            I was somewhat skeptical at first, but when I drove the Dodge Ram 1500 I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth ride and quiet interior.  The truck felt very solid and stable.  The large interior was almost fun!

The 5.9 liter V8 certainly consumed a fair portion of the oil imports however.  Not a surprise as any V8 engine will do that.  But the power and towing ability is awesome.  It's not a race car but it has guts.

My only complaint is that the seat bottom is too long for a shorter person's legs.  It would force me to 'slouch' while driving and on any extended trip, I would end up with back pain.  I did not have the 9-way power seat however, but I don't think that would have solved the physical dimension problem.

The dealership network is great and Dodge maintains good contact with the purchasers of their vehicles.  I would say this truck is one to own.<br><br>
