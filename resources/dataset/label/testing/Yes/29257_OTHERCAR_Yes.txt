            There is a lot of reasons people say not to buy one but, i am here to tell you why to buy one!

Yes, i was skeptical about driving one. But, when i got in one i loved it. It is like any other vehicle if you know how to drive it then you will have no problem. It is the people who do not know how to drive it that these myths of danger come from.

It has lots of room for friends and family. I feel safe driving it as a women. Lots of times when i just had a regular car i would feel on safe when a truck or car would come up behind me. But, know that i have this blazer i feel safe. I do not know why i just know it makes me feel better.

I like the four wheel drive because of the fact i never learned how to drive in snow. This truck drives great in all kinds of things. Once i got stuck in some mud but, i was able to get out with this blazer. When other people stayed stuck into a toe truck came to help them.

i would recommend anybody who wants to have a great vehicle and love it to buy one of these blazers. does not matter what year.

So next time you want to purchase a vehicle test drive one of these! You will love it!<br><br>
