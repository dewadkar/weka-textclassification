            My daughter turned 16 in October and was excited about getting her drivers license.  Because of her age and driving inexperience, I  wanted a vehicle that would be big enough and strong enough so that if something hit her or she hit something else, she would be protected.  Two weeks after she got her actual license, she was driving home from the grocery store and turned in front of a vehicle that she did not realize was going as fast as he was.  He was driving a Ford Escort and crashed into her Montero at about 45 mph.  There was so much force that it lifted the Montero over top of another vehicle and spun it around.  When it impacted the ground, there was such force that it exploded the tires and broke the back axle.  


The police told us that the only thing that saved her life was the vehicle.  It was well built and sturdy and was the perfect vehicle for young, inexperienced drivers as well as experienced drivers.  Both vehicles in the accident were totalled.  There were injuries to the other parties, but my daughter walked away without a single scratch.

We have bought another vehicle for her, and guess what.... we bought another Montero.  This is a vehicle I trust.<br><br>
