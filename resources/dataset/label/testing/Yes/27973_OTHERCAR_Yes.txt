            This is my first truck... so far, it is more comfortable and quieter than any of my cars (all econoboxes or convertibles).  Fuel economy is good for a truck but if I didn't own this one, I might consider a station wagon for my purposes.  I get a little over 20mpg.  I drive a lot on the highway with an occasional foray into the woods, occasional trailering and occasionally moving large stuff.

It drives like a truck and handles like a truck.  Not great on acceleration but adequate power to do pretty much anything if you are just a little patient.  If you want quick acceleration and car like handling, buy a car.  (Duh)

I've driven it 80000 miles with NO mechanical problems.  I changed all the fluids after 30000 miles.  I change the oil every 5000 miles.  I've gone through a couple air filters but that's it.  It gets a little valve rattle when I first start up in cold weather but the Toyota dealer's mechanic said not to do anything about them until 200,000+ miles as they are solid lifters and better loose than too tight.  Ok by me.

The factory tires Dunlops lasted about 70,000 miles.   I had the 225/15's.  I replaced them with the larger factory size tires which has corrected the speedometer which was reading fast.  Not really a practical change but vanity insisted.

Get the extended cab.  I love it.  Back seat is big enough for my dog, groceries, etc.  You can even fit a couple adults back there for short trips.  Move your seat forward a bit and tell them to stop their whining.  I've sat back there and it's really not that bad.  Got a used aluminum cap cheap which is ugly but works well for me.
