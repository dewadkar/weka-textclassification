              The 1991 Plymouth Acclaim will do down in history as one of the best cars ever made by Chrysler/Mopar.  
  I purchased a used 1991 Acclaim in 1997.  Of all the cars I have owned in the past, this one has been the most reliable of them all.  I used to be a Chevrolet person, but now I am proud to be a Chrysler owner!  When I bought the car, the odometer had well over 200k racked up on it, but this did not worry me at all.  The engine did not use a drip of oil and it 'purred' like a kitten.  The body, on the other hand was a different story.  The paint used was of poor quality.  It started to peel and flake off 1 year after it was purchased, according to the first owner.    The transmission was also plagued with issues.  Shortly after I purchased it, I had the transmission replaced due to slippage and poor shifting.  Now it works great!  
  The interior, although basic, is excellent. Even after 11 years, it shows next to no wear and tear.  The seats are cushy, and any stains can be quickly removed.  All accessories (radio, climate control) still work problem free.
  The exterior's main issue is it's paint and rusting issue.  Where the paint has suffered rock chips and dings, rust has tried to move in.  The wheel wells, although plastic, do harbor elements that promote rust along the bottom runner and doors.
  Overall, when kept in check, the Acclaim is an excellent choice, new or used, for persons who are looking for a great car that will go the distance.
  As a side note, as of the beginning of 02', I currently have 410k on the motor and body, and it still looks and runs excellent!
