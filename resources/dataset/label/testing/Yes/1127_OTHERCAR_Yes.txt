            I think my 1999 neon is a target,because it has been hit twice with in the last two months and both have been a hit and run.  I wasn't in the car either time.

The first time my car got hit it was parked in my grandfathers driveway,the guy backed in the driveway to turn around and said that he saw another car coming and he backed up even more and hit my back bumper.  That was $339.58 worth of damage.  The guy left but to bad for him I knew who he was and the police called him when they reached my grandfathers house.  The guy had been drinking and thought that my uncle would fix my car for ten dollars,but my car is new and I wasn't about to let that happen.

The second time my car got hit my husband and I went to the local store,we parked about 100 feet or so from a truck and both of us went into the store.  I never thought that I would have to write down every ones license plate number every time I got out of my vehicle.  My husband and I were in the store for maybe ten minutes.  When we went to get into my car my husband had realized that it had been backed into.  My luck the people left.  A state trooper came to the scene and gave me an accident report,and because we don't know who hit my car my insurance has to pay for it,which will make my rate go up.

I took my neon to a local dealer to get an estimate and the repairs will be $974.00,not as high as we thought.  A head light for my car alone costs $195.00,which I need one.  I also need a new hood and my front bumper needs to be buffed and repainted.

I feel like my car is a target for hit and runs.  My husband said I should paint my car yellow so it can't be missed.<br><br>
