            <b>cons-</b>
1.  In darker settings the AF lag time is pretty slow. (like maybe 1 two 2 seconds.) It is best to prefocus by pressing the button halfway down. outside in the daytime it is a lot better.
2.  No burst mode.
3.  High power consumption.  The alkalines that come in the box(I got energizer e^2 Titanium) hardly lasted 50 pictures, but when i replaced them with 1850mah energizer NiMH rechargeables (9.99 for 4 at target) I get more than 100 pictures with one charge.


<b>Pros-</B>

First let get this out of the way...
<b>8x optical zoom!-</b>  The highest by far that you will find on a camera in this price range.  Of course at high zoom you need fast shutter speeds or a tripod.  I love this zoom ability! I can't say enough about it.

<b>4mp resolution-</b> Great for 8X10 prints with adjustments down to highly compressed 1MP shots.  On best quality (***) 4MP setting, each pic is over 2 Mb, which calls for at least a 64 MB card (unfortunately the camera comes with only a 16 sd card)There is only a 4MP and 1 MP mode but there are three levels of compression on each one leaving you with 6 picture size settings.  I always try to use the best setting though, because you never know which picture you are going to want to blow up to poster size.


<b>Automatic settings-</b>  Right out of the box, it takes great pictures.  My grandma could take amazing pictures with this camera, without having to worry about anything but pressing the button. I, on the other hand, prefer a little more control over the settings, which leads me to the next topic (which is what sold me on the camera (besides the zoom))...

<b>Manual settings-</b> Has manual shutter speed and aperture settings, manual white balance, and ISO selection.  The only thing it is missing is Manual focus, but with such dead-on autofocus, you don't really need manual focus.  (The AF even works in complete darkness) 

<b>EVF-electronic viewfinder-</b>I love this feature.  It shows you a 100% view of the subject on a tiny lcd inside the viewfinder.  That is not much of an improvement over an optical VF, but when you consider that all menus and settings can be viewed or changed without taking the camera away from your face, it adds a great deal to the value of the camera.  It also displays any messages in the evf so you will know if you need the flash, if you are still in macro mode, what shutter/aperture is selected and if any exposure compensation is in use.  It is actually a lot of information on that tiny screen, but still lets you clearly see your subject.

***new addition*******************
<b>Menus and user interface-</b> Very easy to use.  Fast access to the things you need the most and plenty of control. The 4-way rocker arrows that let you navigate the menus is perfectly placed under you right thumb.  Within the first day i got this camera i was flying through the menus without even taking my eye off the EVF to look at the buttons.  I love the fact that you can access the menu while looking in the EVF.  This lets you change from say sport mode(tends toward high shutter speed and high asa) to landscape(tending toward small apertures) mode without taking the camera away from your eye.  Very useful.
The first item on the capture menu is exposure control, it lets you change settings like like shutter/aperture priority, sport mode etc, which is the menu item I access the most by far.  very well designed menus.

<b>Image Quality-</b>The image quality is very good.  The autofocus is super accurate, which results in very sharp looking pictures.  Also the flash almost always produces great exposures(not too dark, not too bright), even in macro mode.  The pictures have a very good range of colors, even with the flash.  When using the iso 100 setting, there is very little if any noise to be found in the pictures. at iso 200 there is some detectable noise but still better than most 4mp (3.9 effective in this case, just in case you were wondering) digitals in this price range.  Some people have said that long zoom pictures look 'soft' but it seems to me that that is happening because of camera shake while using the long zoom, not because of any focusing errors.  You _must_ use a tripod,find more light (use flash) or crank up the shutter speed if you want to use the 8x optical zoom in most indoor situations.  Otherwise the resulting shutter speed in those type of lighting situations (usually around 1/60 or 1/30) is way to slow to hand-hold the camera without some shake.  Remember that you are dealing with the eqivilent of about a 300mm zoom lens.  
***********************************

<b>My Opinion-</b>
Overall, I am very satisfied with the HP 850 camera.  I was worried at first about not having enough manual control over the pictures, but this camera is exactly what I was looking for.  It is simple enough for a beginner with enough control for a photography enthusiast.  The only people who may want to consider a different camera is someone who needs faster shutter response(for sports or other fast action).  I would suggest the cannon G3.  It has similar features with much faster shutter response(But much less zoom and a much higher price.)  For anyone else who is looking for <b><i>a great digital camera packed with features for a great price, the HP 850 is for you. </b></i>
