            AHHH the 99 Tahoe, I bought it so I could have a bigger, safer car to drive on the highway 30 miles a day to work. It is excellent!!!! The interior is roomy!!! This vehicle is sooooo easy to drive, it is unbelieveable! Whenever my kids are old enough to drive, I am going to sugest something like this since it is so easy to drive and it is safe. So in other words, I would basically recommend the Tahoe for drivers of all ages. The one thing about this vehicle I cannot stand is the gas economy. The typical fill-up is a little over thirty dollars, and since I was used to a small car, I was a little budget-shocked. But as far as I am concerned, this is the Tahoe's only major flaw.<br><br>
