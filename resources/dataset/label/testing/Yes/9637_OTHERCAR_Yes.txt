            I bought this camera about 10 months ago.  I've used digital cameras, but hadn't actually spent the money on buying one.  I spent $288, which was pretty cheap for a 4MP camera.  I couldn't find any reviews on line when I bought it, but Fry's had it on display.  I don't know if you can buy it anywhere other than eBay now.

The features of the camera that I liked are that it uses regular AA batteries, so I can use NiMh batteries.  Also 3X optical zoom.  It also uses fairly standard SD flash, which has become cheaper, and more standard in the last 10 months, since PDAs use it.

A couple places that I found it to be lacking are, the auto focus doesn't have a light assist.  So it can't focus if it's very dark.  And there's no raw format for saving the pictures.  It also seems to be lacking a little on the color accuracy, although for 90% of what I do it works fine.  Also, since it wasn't intended to be a high end camera, there are no accessories available (lenses, filters, etc).  It only came with a 16M flash, which only holds 20 pics at the highest quality.  They could have included a 32M.  Steves digicams has a good review.

The camera also can make 30 second movies with sound.  It seems to have decent battery life using NiMh batteries.  The menus are fairly easy to get around in.  And the display is sharp, although a little small.  

My conclusion, it's a decent camera for the price I paid.  It would have cost me double to get a better camera.  Since 99% of what I use it for is either recording the quality of something with the highest amount of detail, or posting web pics, this camera works fine.  The few times I've wanted to take a picture of an item and have the color be very accurate, it didn't work out so well.  The build quality seems to be decent.
