            Our family has driven Jeep products for decades.  But when our 98 Cherokee went slowly belly up, we discovered Cherokees had been discontinued.  So the search for the perfect SUV had begun.  The rules were: enough storage for our kayaking equipment, better gas mileage, good snow car, good back seat, and reliable, reliable, reliable.

The CRV is a huge improvement over previous models and many of its competitors.  The cargo area is enormous.  Bigger than the Cherokee and double that of the Liberty.  Honda has apparently sold their souls again and managed to squeeze nearly 170horses out of a fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engine.  Our gas mileage has nearly doubled from the 14 we were getting to nearly 28 on open roads.  We packed this thing to the roof and drove it over the Catoctins and up to Cape Cod.  It never slowed down.  Well, except for the backup on the GW Bridge in NYC.

The President's Day Storm was our first major test.  We got nearly 34 inches of the predicted 8 inches of snow.  The plows left a glacier of snow and ice blocking the alleyway to our cars.  We backed up and ran (POOF!) right through/over the embankment without a hitch.

Despite some voluntary recalls from Honda ("There's a possibility that someday this part might fail, so we redesigned it just in case.") it's had zero problems.  But it's a Honda.  This is what they do.

Once complaint true of all SUVs?  The blind spot from hell.  Be careful merging left.
