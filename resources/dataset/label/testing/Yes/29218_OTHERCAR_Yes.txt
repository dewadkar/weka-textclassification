            I recently drove a new Lincoln Town car for more than a month while my car was being repaired. I drove the car during work and on family trips. I had the opportunity to drive the car on twisting mountain roads and long highway straights. I was pleased with the car in all road conditions and environments. 

For a large car it was quite nimble and powerful. In the mountains it was maneuverable enough to allow me to easily pass the slower traffic with out strain. On highways I had no problem merging or keeping up with the traffic flow.

The car had plenty of passenger and trunk space. We travelled during Christmas Holidays with two adults and two children. We also had to carry plenty of gifts. Although the trunk was packed tight and we had to put several suitcases in the passenger space, we were able to bring everything we needed and remain comfortable during a long trip.

The only drawbacks were the entry system and less than spectacular gas mileage. Like many new cars the only outside lock was on the driver's side. Unless one has the keyless entry remote then the driver's door must be opened to get in any of the other doors. I averaged only about 15 miles per gallon. 

Overall I enjoyed driving the car and I received a number of positive comments on its appearance
