            As the owner of a 1992 Aerostar Extended Mini Van, there is a little room for improvement.  The overall performance of the van is great.  It has good handling, acceleration, and power.  The interior is very roomy with space behind the rear seat to carry cargo.  Dual air/heating is a great feature because the rear passengers are able to control the settings to suit their needs.  
The problem that I find with the Aerostar is a faulty power steering pump. After a short time, the power steering pump begins to lose fluid and starts to whine.  The repair cost is astronomical, because the only fix is to replace the pump all together. Due to the fact that we purchased our van used, this isn't covered by a warranty.  
Though the repair for this is costly, I am pleased with the our purchase. The Ford Aerostar very comfortable for our 4 daughters and we feel they are safe traveling in it.<br><br>
