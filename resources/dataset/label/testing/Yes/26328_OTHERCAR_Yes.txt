            I was looking for a comfortable SUV for my wife and 2 small children that had the 3 row seat for occasional trips with friends. I considered the MDX and GX470 closely after eliminating the others like X5/ML320/PILOT/4Runner/Sequoia etc. 

We had the last rev toyota 4Runner and the new Tundra Xtra cab before and had high expectations for the new 4Runner. We were truly dissapointed in the new 4Runner limited and how plastic the interior felt. Our old limited 4Runner had much nicer styling in our opinion. Seeing the GX470 is based on the new 4Runner chassis and had the engine of the Tundra it made it seem a good fit. 

One drive in the GX470 is all it takes to realise how smooth, quite and comfortable a true quality vehicle can be at its best. The smell of the leather alone is unlike no other. We call it our magic carpet as its like floating between destinations. I actually look forward to trips in the GX. I am sure I will see more of California this year than any other as I am not concerned about the travelling part with our new GX. 

The NAV/CVD/Levinson equipment is very good. The low road/engine noise is fantastic. The variable suspension firmness setting are very noticable and useful. 

After our Tundra/4Runner experience it is very noticable how the GX retains is postuer when turning. Very little roll, retaining a level state even when pushing it very hard. Confidence inspiring ride. 

The Lexus dealership experience was very painless, I got a great deal with little negotiating and left with exactly the car I wanted. 

I feel I have better value for money with this expensive car than any other I have ever owned. True luxury. 

Gold/tan GX470 DVD/NAV/Levinson/Tow and extras, list $53,048.00 - paid much less.
