            I've owned my 1999 VW Passat Wagon since September, and I can honestly say it is the best car I've ever driven.  I needed a family sized vehicle to replace my ailing minivan, but I wasn't happy with the current slew of minivans offered.  I went to the VW dealer just to see what they had, and it was love at first sight.  The many extras are what make this car worth every penny.  For example, with the twist of a knob, the glove box can be converted into a cooler for your soda or a candy bar.  The side airbags are IN the side of the seat, rather than the door, so you receive the benefits of the airbag even if your seat is laid back.  There is more than enough cargo space in the rear, especially with the 60 - 40 split rear seats.  There is ample power under the hood with the turbo charged 4 cylinder, though I'd suggest the manual transmission for a little extra pep.  The standard stereo system is feisty enough to satisfy even the younger ones in the family, and can be improved with a 10-disc CD changer mounted in the rear.  There are even extra 12-volt outlets in the rear cargo area which can come in handy at times.  The car handles very well, and has a nice, smooth ride.  The dual position sun roof is divine, and the nearly power everything makes for a pleasant driving experience.  Did I mention the heated side mirrors?  Even the intermittent wipers are &quot;smart&quot; -- they adjust their frequency based on whether or not you are driving or stopped!  There are a few drawbacks.  The seat adjusts 3 different ways (a good thing), but all seat controls are manual, not power.  There is no shut off switch for the passenger airbag, which is OK for me, but might not be for everyone.  The only other drawback is the price -- there's little haggle room on the mid-$20,000 price tag due to the popularity of this vehicle.  It's a nice family car, with a little dose of sport to go with it.  If you need a wagon or minivan for your family, but you don't want the &quot;typical&quot; wagon, then this is definitely the car for you!<br><br>
