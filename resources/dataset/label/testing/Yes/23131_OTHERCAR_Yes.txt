            I purchased this car (98 Dodge Stratus) about six months ago from a Budget car Rental sales lot.  It had about 22,000 miles on it and I felt it was a good value at $12,800.

The car is large for a midsize and has lots of power for freeways. The interior is nice, comfortable and well designed.  I like the big trunk, comfortable seats, and even the basic factory stereo sounds good. I live in Las Vegas and the Air Conditioning does well keeping me cool in the summer days.  One thing I really like is how quite the car is when it is running. The mileage I am getting is about 22 MPG. The downside to this car is the ride is a little stiffer that I like, but still very acceptable.

I would buy another one of these cars and have recommended them to friends. I really like buying from Budget Car sales, the price was much less than new, I still had a lot of the factory warranty left and the prices were clearly marked and the buying process was easy.<br><br>
