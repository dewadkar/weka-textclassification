            In January 2002, when looking for a new car to replace our Volvo S70, I wanted an Audi A4 but my wife wanted a BMW.   I did not want a bimmer since I had one about 10 years ago, which drove like a charm on dry roads but slipped and slid on snowy surfaces, even when equipped with good winter tires.  On the other hand, I also had an Audi 100 at one time, which was no match to the bimmer in driving pleasure but drove well in the winter given its front-wheel drive train.  

My wife then visited Audi dealers and BMW dealers to get prices and specs.  At that time, since the current Audi A4 had just began its first model year, the Audi dealers did not have the cars in the showroom, did not know the types of options on the cars that they would receive, and could only give approximate prices.  Fed up with this nonsense, I let my wife buy a 3-series BMW but decided on the 320i, thinking that with slower acceleration, the &#145rear twist&#146 on sleepy roads would be less pronounced.  With the rather firm pricing of BMW dealers, the cost of a few options and an automatic transmission, the bimmer ended up costing more than a much better equipped Audi A4 1.8T.  I was surprised at the long list of costly options for the BMW.  Well, it&#146s a bimmer.  Another thing worth mentioning:  since we live in big city and it did not snow that week, I could not test drive the BMW on snowy roads.

On the road, I rediscovered the driving pleasure of bimmers.  The 'musical noise' and the smoothness of the engine, the perfect driving position, the simplicity and ergonomics of the inside, the fit and finish, etc.  But the biggest upside surprise to me was that how the car, now equipped with traction control as standard equipment, drives so well on snowy roads when equipped with snow tires.  As soon as the rear started slipping, the traction control kicked in to prevent the car from spinning.  (Of course, no one in his right mind would drive fast on snow and ice).  There is virtually no difference in winter conditions-driving between the 320i and my previous front-wheel drive Volvo S70, which was also equipped with snow tires of the same make.  If I had known that, I would have gone for the 325i.  Don&#146t get me wrong, the automatic transmission of the 320i is extremely smooth and probably the best in its class, but I often put it in the &#145sport&#146 mode or even  the &#145manual shift&#146 mode to get the extra zip.  Another pleasant surprise is the reliability of the car: not a single problem after 18 months of usage.  The downside surprise was that the car has no reading of outside temperature.  We assumed that this feature was a given for cars of this class and therefore did not order the on-board computer that does provide outside temperature readings.  Now, it&#146s not possible to install one.  After years of driving cars equipped with outside temperature-reading instruments, it&#146s a hard adjustment for me.  I hope that the folks from BMW take note of this.

I have seen claims and statistics from the competition to BMW.   Assuming that all these stats and claims are factual (some companies are known to inflate their claims), I think that they do not tell the whole story.  I compare the bimmer to Wayne Gretzky, the best hockey player of all times.  There are always players who can skate faster, or shoot the puck harder, or forecheck better than Gretzky, etc., but none of them can combine these skills in a better or more intelligently way than Gretzky can (my apologies to non-ice hockey fans, who may not know who Gretzky is, for using this analogy).  In summary, I am very satisfied with my BMW.
