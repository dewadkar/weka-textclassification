                 I truly love SUV's, having grown up around cars and working on them for almost half of my life.  My first ever automobile was a Jeep Wrangler, and that car was great.  But, seven months ago, I purchased a brand new 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport.  Ever since the day I bought it, I have loved everything about it.  The 4.0 Liter 6-cylinder engine is very powerful and extremely quick.  I raced my friend who drives a Ford Mustang, and I beat him with my Jeep.  
     I also love my Jeep for its four-wheel-drive.  In the snow, it drives perfectly.  No problems at all.  I was able to maneuver through the snow covered streets and make it to work, early for once.  If I were driving a two-wheel-drive automobile, I probably would not have even gone in.  
     Another of Jeep Cherokee's great features is its styling.  I absolutely love the way it looks.  It looks strong and powerful, yet still like something you would like to take the kids to school in.  When I was buying it, I was undecided on whether to get the Cherokee or the Grand Cherokee.  I decided on the Cherokee Sport because it was considerably less money.  The money that you have to pay for the Grand Cherokee is way too much.  The Jeep Cherokee is a much better bargain, and it is a great automobile.
     So, for anyone who is thinking about buying a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport, I recommend it greatly, and I know you will have a lot of fun driving it. <br><br>
