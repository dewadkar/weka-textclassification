            I bought My 2001 V8 TRD Tundra a year and 3/4 ago. It has 42,000 miles on it, and I am throughly impressed with this truck. It has all the power I need to pass when and where I want, even towing a loaded trailor. The biggest load I pulled yet was about 6,000 pounds of deer corn, and the truck was still fast and powerful.  I've packed the bed with everything imagenable, even about 1800 pounds of sackcrete bags, and the springs seemed not to notice it very much. I work it hard pulling and towing loads, off road riding, and racing up and down the road, but it never 
complains one bit. No maintinace to this day, other than changing the oil. It's interior looks and feels high quality, and appears very solid. It also has alot of useful accessories like 6 cup holders, two consoles, three plug-ins, hidden storage compartments, and still seats 6.  My only complaint is the cloth on the front doors resembles a lent brush and picks up every fuzzball in site. Over all it looks great, andles great, runs very fast and strong, it pulls like crazy, and feels more solid and well built than any other new pick up that I have driven. The Tundra is well worth what I payed for it. Email me at XGERMX7@aol.com if you have any questions.
