            Highly recommended. I commute 50 miles each day and the car is a gem.  It is a great looking, roomy, enjoyable car.  I've owned a Corolla before, but it was too boring.  I got a better deal on the Mazda because it is often overlooked.  Fully loaded, and still cheaper than a Honda.  My wife loves it so much, she takes it on the weekends.  Fit and finish are above average, the paint jobs on a Mazda are flawless.  Surprise - surprise, a Japanese car actually made in Japan. Hiroshima as a matter of fact.  My wife loves the fact that it has a CD player and a cassette.  The radio is mounted high like my old Jetta and not down near the floor.  Only fault that I can see is that the intermittent wipers are not variable.  If you want the automatic, get the bigger engine.  I tried all flavors of the car and the SE won. (comes with bigger engine, 15&quot; alloy wheels, power windows, automatic, cruise control, etc).  The car did very well in the last snowstorm we had.<br><br>
