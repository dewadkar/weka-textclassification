            I have tested both Dodge Durango SLT and R/T.  My best friend had the SLT and now got the R/T.  
The SLT is equipped with a V8, 5.9l engine developping 245HP.  A great engine, very quiet, with lots of torque.  Able to bring you from 0-60mph in about 8.5sec.  Not bad for a truck this size.  Maximum speed, as we often tested it, is electronically limited at 120mph.

But at that speed, gas will disappear quicker than a 50-pound bag of Doritos in a house with a teenager.
This truck drinks... you'll wonder if your tank is leaking as it rarely does better than 15mpg

But, when you accept the fact that you'll have to start using coupons at the grocery store to fill your truck, you are rewarded with one of the best truck experience you can have

This truck is fast, tough, great off-road in summer and winter.  This truck is strong, you could almost pull a house filled with Kevin Costner's ego without any problems.

Talking about strong.  We once were able, with a chain and a lot of will, to pull a Hummer that was strangely stuck in a sand bunk.

Interior space is amazing.  You can sit up to 8 people in it.  All chipping in for the gas.  And the 2 back seats can be easily folded.  This way you have lots of very usable space.

And the back seats are great too.  High enough so you can see easily outside but without having your head stuck to the roof.

Also outstanding in this truck is its stability when taking a curb.  You always feel very secure.  You almost feel as if you were in a big car.

Inside you can find many amenities.  Like dual power outlets, individual front and back heating ducts, heating seats in R/T.  CD player stereo system with incredible sound.  Leather seats, and everything else you need to be comfortable.  

And the look.  Especially in black, it could make Leonardo Di Caprio look manly.  When speeding a bit on the highway, you'll see cars jumping out of your way, afraid you'll run over them.  This truck is a macho, virile, bad machine.

Talking about the R/T.  It's almost the same thing.  The big differences being:  the 5.9 engine makes 250hp instead of 245 with 350lb-ft of torque at 3000rpm.  It uses 275/60R17 fat tires instead of 16 inches.  And the exhaust isn't quiet anymore... it doesn't emit sound, it emits raw power.

So it's hard finding bad things to say about this truck.  It's everything a truck should be.  There's no compromise... it's a truck for truck loving people with truck money in their pocket for gas.  
If that's what you are, here's your truck!
