            For me, the Sony Mavica FD-81 was a splurge.  I had no problem convincing the wife that we needed a camera to document the life of our four year old (and to help her take photos for her ebay auctions).  

We got a good price.  We shopped all the local stores and the web.  In the end we would up calling to several of the larger web based resellers on the phone and haggling over the price.  We weren't bashful.  We told each representative which other companies we were in contact with and their approximate price.  We narrowed it down to two and asked for their best and final.

Those guys fought for our business.  In the end we would up getting the camera for over $100 less than the advertised price.  It arrived three business days later.

Both my wife and I use the FD-81 weekly.  While my wife has clamed her auction interest; it is my camera of choice for all family events and travel.  Coupled with Yahoo! Photos for showing pics off to family and friends it is great.  Note: Yahoo! Photos now offers a print service.  We have not received photos from them yet but the initial experience was good.

It is not a small camera.  With accessories it takes up as much space as a 35MM.  The camera itself handles very much like a 35 MM with standard lens.

Our camera has broken.  We had a problem after several months reading disks.  We contacted Sony via phone and sent the camera back for service.  They were good.  They gave us a clear idea of how long it would take (3 weeks round trip) and got the camera back with a new floppy drive (supposedly this updates it to the equivalent of an FD-83?).

I've taken this camera all over the USA and to Europe and China.  I've never had a problem with the charger.  I always carry a spare battery (battery life is as displayed but the battery loses charge quickly is you spend lots of time looking at pics or if you format a floppy in the camera).  I always carry a disk wallet with 6 to 12 HD floppies.  

I find that I can get 24-30 low resolution (640x480) pics on a disk.  It is approximately the same for high resolution pics (up to 24?).  

I enjoy the MPG movie feature and use it often.  It eats disks.  One 60 second (just keep holding the button down and the movie taking continues) movie will just fit on a HD floppy.

I enjoy the Mavica's capability of building an HTML file on the floppy that can then be used to look at all photos.  I wish the off board (PC based) software for looking at JPG and MPG files was better.  I use just my browser.

If you are thinking about a digital camera and you want one that you'll get real everyday use out of I suggest the FD-81 from Sony.  There are others that offer better features and performance (and cost more) but this is a great, useable digital camera.
