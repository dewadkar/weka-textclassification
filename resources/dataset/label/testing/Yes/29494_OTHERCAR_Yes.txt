            The Kodak DC240 is a good basic digital camera.  It has just enough features to add a little variety to your pictures.  The setup and features menu are easy to understand and use, therefore making the camera easy to use.  The instruction manual doesn't even need to be opened. 
The camera takes great pictures when you have a still target that is within 6 feet but no closer then 4 feet, which is limited.  The camera takes average pictures when your target may move, you may be moving to try and capture the target, and/or you're outside of the range I mentioned earlier.  If you are mostly interested in taking pictures for the internet, whether it be for email or your own website, then this camera has no downsides in terms of picture quality.  If you intend on printing some of your pictures I suggest nothing bigger then a 5x7.  I recommend nothing bigger then a 4x6 for 99.9% replication of a 35mm camera shot.  Most people put their pictures in a frame and if you put your printed digital pictures in a frame even a 5x7 will look like it was snapped with a 35mm camera and developed in a photo lab.  If your pictures are not in a frame and studied closely then it would be obvious the camera was printed from your home office printer.  You will see that the picture is grainy.  I have a good HP printer in the 900 series and always use the highest quality photo paper.  Even at the best resolution and with a perfect target a 5x7 or larger picture will look anywhere from slightly grainy to downright awful.  
If you're further then 6ft away from your target the 3x optical zoom won't be much assistance.  The optical zoom is adequate but at times it left me wanting more power and a telephoto lens.  (The lens kits that Kodak sells for the camera would be a nice addition.  You'll also need the lens adapter.)  We all know that digital zoom isn't really worth talking about so the 2X digital zoom is pretty insignificant.  
With the DC240 you can not be too close to your target and use the flash.  This makes it difficult and most of the time impossible to take closeups when the lighting is less then ideal.  If you try to take a picture of something with the flash and you are less then 3ft away from the target then the flash whites everything out.  Luckily it's a digital camera and you can discard the "white" picture and backup or turn some lights on.  
The LCD display on the back of the camera can be deceiving at times.  When you take a picture it's sometimes tough to tell how it will actually look on your monitor and or printed.  Sometimes the picture will look too dark but it will be just fine when you look at it on the monitor or when it's printed out.  So be cautious of what pictures you discard, you could be throwing away a good shot without realizing it.  According to the tech guys at Kodak using the LCD display to take pictures will drain batteries even quicker then usual.  It can also be inaccurate in terms of centering your target.  
The storage options are good for this camera as it uses compact flash cards.  You can buy compact flash cards in any store that sells electronics and they are fairly inexpensive now.  Kodak also sells a kit with a flash card and a flash card reader for devices with a PCMCIA Type II or Type III slot (i.e. most laptops).  This comes in handy when I travel and I only have my laptop.  I can download my pictures onto my laptop and keep on shooting away.  The other benefit to compact flash cards is that a desktop card reader for your PC is inexpensive and is the fastest way to download your pictures from your camera to your PC.  It's definitely faster then a serial port connection.  I have a SanDisk card reader which I bought new for $30.00, and it's a USB connection.  
The software that comes with the camera is adequate for people who don't know how to use other photo software or already have a preference.  The software that comes with the camera is good for organizing your photos into digital albums.  I use the Kodak software to view my photos initially and then organize them into digital albums.  Then I use Adobe Photoshop to touch or otherwise enhance the photos.  Both pieces of software integrate well with each other.  Which is to say that I can easily find my photos after saving them in the digital albums and then opening up Adobe Photoshop to edit them.  The Kodak software also has a slideshow function which is nice when showing off to "low tech" friends. 
The bag that came with the camera is small, has an adjustable strap, a pouch for an extra memory card, and four straps for extra batteries.  The bag is slightly padded but definitely would not protect the camera from a fall.
The biggest downside to the camera is the battery life or lack thereof.  The camera drains batteries very quickly.  When I use my camera at a rate of taking 50 to 100 pictures a day (which is easy to do with a digital camera) then I usually have to change my batteries every third day.  The rechargeable batteries that came with the camera are nothing to speak of as they were of no use after I had the camera a month.  At the present time I use regular old alkaline batteries.  I've tried most of the brands out there, including the types that are supposedly designed for electronic gadgets such as the digital camera.  The results are the same no matter which brand you use.  
All in all the DC240 is a great digital camera for pictures that are to be used electronically (i.e. sent in email or put on a webpage.)  It's a good digital camera to work side by side your 35mm camera, but with a 1.3 megapixel resolution don't expect the DC240 to replace your 35mm.
