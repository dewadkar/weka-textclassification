              I want to start off by saying that the Dodge Grand Caravan is great for families.  This van is fairly priced, and middle class.  It is not as good as some of the other vans that are more expensive, but it is not as bad as the vans that are less expensive.  So, if your looking for a good, dependable minivan and at a fair price, this is the van you want.
  
  I'll start off by telling you how comfortable this minivan is.  It is very comfy, even for long roadtrips.  One factor that affects how comfy a minivan is how much space there is.  And, of course when your looking for a minivan, you have to consider the amount of room it has.  The Dodge Grand Caravan has a decent amount of space in the front, middle and back.  

  This minivan has a nice smooth ride.  There is not a lot of rattling when driving.  Rarely do I have to take it to the shop, so it is a dependable car. 

  There is only one con that I can think of for this minivan.  Even though it has two sliding doors (for conviency) they are difficult to open.

  Anyone could buy this product.  But you probably would get the most use out of it if you have a 4/5 or more people in your family.  

  The Dodge Grand Caravan not only has good gas mileage, but also can run on just the regular gas.  I recommend this minivan to anyone who has a fairly large family, travels on roadtrips, wants comfort in their car, and wants a good deal!
