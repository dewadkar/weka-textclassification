            After consulting with friends and reading everything I could get my hands on about Digital cameras, I decided to buy the Olympus Camedia D-340-R.  It turned out to be the perfect choice for my needs.  With a purchase price of $296, it was a wonderful value. I have always been a terrible photographer but this camera allows me to take pictures like a pro.  It has just enough options to be versatile yet not complicated.  The close up pictures show absolutely beautiful detail, clear and crisp.  
It has several flash options and also shuts off automatically.  It included everything I needed to get started (batteries and charger, software, cables).  <br><br>
