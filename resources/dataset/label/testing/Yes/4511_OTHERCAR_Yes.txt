            Dear Reader,
It may not be the fanciest thing on four wheels but if you prefer to spend your hard earned dough on something other than a large car payment then the Tercel may be for you.

I bought my dark red, 3 door "DX" just over a year ago acting on the recommendation of a friend who had owned one from new.  I found it in a used car lot here in Wisconsin.  The dealer said it had been sitting on his lot for 4 months because people around here are all about trucks and SUV's.  I took it as a positive sign when it fired up immediately.

My car has the 5 speed transmission, cloth seats, AM/FM cassette.  And that's about it - this is real no frills motoring.  It has no A/C which would probably be an issue in warmer parts.  It had about 68000 miles on it at the time and I've put 10000 additional trouble free miles on it since.  Its needed nothing in that time but new front brakes and the usual oil/filter changes.  It uses a fair bit of oil (maybe a quart per month) and belches out plenty of blue smoke when started from cold.  This is not enough to make me go out and get it fixed though.  

The only other problem is the windshield washer which doesn't work.  From what I hear this is pretty common on this model so don't forget to check it before you buy (like I did.)  These cars are bulletproof and I have no reason to believe mine won't last forever.  Unless.....

Anything runs in to it.  Make no mistake my friend - these are tiny cars.  They have no presence on the road and you need eyes in the back of your head when you're driving.  It does not inspire a warm, safe feeling.  This is not necessarily the fault of this particular car.  If everyone drove one it'd be fine but the afore mentioned residents of the dairy state do feel the need to drive obscenely large vehicles.  I also make a point of avoiding the interstate.
On a related note - the '92 model is the last year without airbags and both driver and front seat passenger have a ridiculous separate lap belt arrangement.  If you're going to buy one try and find a '93 or later.  
These cars are also very economical on gas.  I can easily get 35mpg out of it in mixed driving conditions.  When buying the car I was also concerned that a lot of older Japanese cars tend to be rust buckets and that is only accentuated by the fact that they cover the roads here with about a foot of salt for 6 months out of the year.  But so far I have a rust spot the size of a quarter on the front fender and that's it.  The paint is still nice and shiny which is not bad for a 12 year old car.
