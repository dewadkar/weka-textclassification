            I bought this vehicle after my fourth child was born! I absolutely love my Astro Van, it fits my whole family and is comfortable. Granted, the ride is somewhat rough, but once you break it in your ok. The chevy Astro Van is affordable and dependable.  I haven't had to visit the shop once since I bought my van. As for affordability, it ranks in the top! All the children fit very comfortable and I hear no complaining. As for the sound system, it is not that great, it kinda of rattles and the speaker are very anti-bass. But when you buy a mini-van for a big family, you usually don't need a full bass driving sound anyhow.<br><br>
