            I bought this over the internet with a tripod after reading numerous reviews and opinions for four or five of the cameras with movie and sound capability.  I bought it for use with future grandchildren and travel.  My wife wants to take close-up pictures for possible e-bay sale.

The internet experience worked out well and the camera was shipped and delivered across the country in less than a week.  It came with a PDR-BT1 battery but I plan to buy a PDR-BT2 for a spare in the near future.  I have charged it up about 4 times and am starting to get closer to a full charge.  The last time it ran continuously with the LCD on for about an hour and a half.  I was taking pictures, movies and sound bites and playing them back.  

I have taken a cross section of daylight, indoor and night pictures and am very pleased with the pictures.  This is my first digital.  I have played them back on the TV and can't really tell much difference in the resolution settings.  The picture all look clear and the color is outstanding.  The playback zoom works well.  

The camera is easy to use once you get familiar with how the settings are displayed in the various modes.  If you have trouble with a computer or VCR you may have trouble with advanced modes.  The auto mode is particularly easy which will get a lot of use in our family.  The speed with which the camera takes pictures is impressive compared to some of the others I demo'd.  It can take up to eight pictures in burst mode and you can easily chose which to keep and which to dump.  It also can take a 36 picture series of an action (e.g. golf swing) and play it back like a mini-movie.  The last picture can be reviewed and deleted if necessary. 

There are also manual adjustment modes for serious photographers (not me) which are not in the manual but good directions are available on the toshiba.com web site.  The slow shutter speed warning is useful (use a tripod).  The zoom was smooth and favorably located for me.  The digital zoom also seems to work well.  The auto flash was particularly good on close-ups.  I did notice some blueness on longer shots.  The red light avoidance worked on my dog.

The only problem I had was the first spare 64MB Smart Media card I bought seemed to hang up in the camera.  I had no problems with the 16 MB that came with the camera.  The technical rep on the 800 number for Toshiba was encouraging and helpful.  I took it around to some shops and it is a rare problem for the most part with Smart Media.  I finally screwed up my courage and got it out with a bit of extra force and a taped pair of pliars.  There had to have been a little bit of an edge because it has worked perfectly since.

I am going to upgrade to windows 98 in the near future.  I have used the software (Image Expert) that came with the camera on some other digital photos and it seems very satisfactory to me.  It works in Windows 95 with no problems. <br><br>
