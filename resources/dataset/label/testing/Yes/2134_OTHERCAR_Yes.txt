            The Volkswagen Golf/2000 is a great car for the money. 
We paid around $15 k US from the dealership. They were also offering $1500 off on the 2000's since the 2001's were just arriving on the lot. My advice? Buy your next car during the month of October. Period!

The 1st car I ever owned was a 1985 VW Golf. It was a good deal at the time but after 10 years started to have some major electrical/alternator/battery problems. Was I ready to try another VW?

According to the latest &quot;Lemonade&quot; reviews the 2000 Golf had supposedly solved the notorious VW Electrical problems. So we took the plunge and decided to test drive a few.....

We started with the Jetta - both standard and automatic transmissions.
Then the Golf, standard and automatic as well. My 1st car was a standard, and I found that it was a bit of a pain in bumper to bumper traffic. The clutch and shifting was incredibly smooth on these 2000 VW's. I liked the control of power (and gear shifting) you get with the standard and thought that this is what we would get. Then we tried the automatic.

We were very impressed with the ride as well. Driving in some small neighborhoods - where there was a lot of stop and go proved the deciding factor. The automatic (GLS) had power off the start, and shifted smoothly and expectedly as we picked up speed... and it was nice to give your left leg a rest. We had made up our minds - we would go with automatic this time around. And for the price difference and relative comfort of the Golf we decided that the Golf was a better buy.

The only black Golf on the lot also came with Sun Roof, Alloy wheels, Monsoon sound, and winter package. We could have saved another $1500 or so by removing the alloy wheels, but decided to stay with it as it was. 

Now that it's winter here in Ottawa we sure are glad we have the winter package - those heated seats make those early rides into work a pleasure. It's like riding to work in a spa!  

We liked the options with the sun roof as well. It can simply tilt open or slide all the way back. It also has this special &quot;no sound&quot; position. Great engineering here. Out on the highway there was barely a whistle.
Closed, the sun roof lets extra light into the car and gives it a more spacious feel. 

The Monsoon surround sound system is incredible. (8 speakers)
The car has dozens of new features. They have just about thought of everything... from special child-proof safety locks, windows, heated mirrors, pop-out coffee holders, and everything opens and closes with a gentle air cushioned hydraulic smoothness. When you start the car even the radio comes on gradually. 

The drive is typical of German engineered cars. It takes corners like a BMW. Great little car for a reasonable price.
