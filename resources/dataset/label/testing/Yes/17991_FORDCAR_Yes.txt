            It was time to trade my 1987 Mercury Grand Marquis - and I wanted something different.  I considered an SUV and ended up buying a 2000 Eddie Bauer Explorer.  It is loaded with the power moon roof, 5.0L V8 etc...  Driving it took a little getting used to, but I love it.  It handles reasonably well, is quiet, solid, and well made.  It looks good and is very comfortable to drive, except on bad streets.  I overlook this because it is really a truck.  I especially like the 5.0L V8 because it has plenty of power and torque, and reliability.  The V8 comes with the towing package, which I like, even though I won't be towing anything.  The added radiator capacity and transmission cooler come in handy in heavy traffic when its 95F.  The gas mileage isn't a problem for me since I drove a big car.  I get somewhere in the neighborhood of 20mpg (city and highway driving combined).  The K&amp;N air filter REALLY helps with the gas mileage and helps to wake up the 5.0.  I highly recommend it and it doesn't void the factory warranty.  The seats are very comfortable and there is a reasonably good amount of cargo area.

People who should buy this vehicle are those who want an SUV, but want something a little smaller than an Expedition.  Those who shouldn't are those who expect it to drive like a luxury car.
