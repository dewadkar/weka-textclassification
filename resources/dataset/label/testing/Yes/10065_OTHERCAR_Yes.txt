            The Nissan Xterra is exactly what a SUV should be without all those extras you don't need. It is so good in fact,that for the first time in 15 years, I did not buy a Toyota.
	It is built solid. This fact is apparent from the moment you open the door. All the doors open and close easily and securely. They feel well engineered and well built. It feels solid as you drive it for the first time. The handling feels tight and firm, just like a truly capable off-road vehicle should. True, it won't do so well in high speed cornering. You need to remember though, that this vehicle was designed to get you into and out of those out of the way places that rarely have nice,easy access roads with perfect pavement. 
	Despite this,don't believe for a second that the on-road ride suffers for the off-road prowess, because it does not. I just completed a 1000 mile road trip in mine, and it was a great on the freeway, highway and even on city streets. Road noise it kept to a minimum, and engine noise is just perfect to let you know what is happening under the hood. The 6 CD in dash changer AM/FM stereo with on audio controls on the steering wheel help to make those long miles between destinations melt away in a sweet sounding bliss. The environmental controls are perfect. You have total control on the temperature inside no matter what it is like outside, with controls that are well thought out and easy to adjust.  The stadium seating for the back seat gives a great view out the windshield for passengers in the back. The 10 tie down points in the rear make securing your cargo a simple task. These all add up to make the Xterra a comfortable place in which to travel, no matter whether your destination is the mountains, the ocean, the desert or just work.
	The best aspect of the Xterra, for most people, is its price. When you check the Xterras price with the other comparable SUVs (4runner, Montero Sport, Rodeo/Passport, and even Pathfinder), the Xterra is the clear winner. The Xterra is definitely a SUV for those of us who need an off-road capable SUV, but would rather spend our money on the other equipment in our lives (snowboards, surf boards, mountain bike, etc.) 
	After months of research, it was the Xterras price that lead me to test drive it. It was the solid feel and great features that lead me to buy it.  I could not be happier with my Xterra, and would buy another one tomorrow if something happened to mine.  I would recommend the Xterra to anyone that wants a high quality, off-road capable SUV, but doesn't want to spend $40K to get one.<br><br>
