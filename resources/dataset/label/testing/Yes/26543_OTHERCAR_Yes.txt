<TEXT>
            I purchased a Chevy S10 Tahoe from a used car dealer after looking at many compact pick up trucks.  This truck seemed well made and a little more luxurious (if a pickup can be a luxury!) than the others that I had looked at.

The truck is very comfortable and the controls are convenient.  The stereo system is very good.  The truck shift easily (standard shift) and drives more like a car than a truck.

The one problem with the S10 that I have is that it doesn't seem to have enough power when loaded with 1/2 ton of material.  The truck seems to work extra hard with the load.  I expected a little more power with a 6-cylinder vehicle after looking at so many 4-cylinder pickups.  Also, the gas mileage is a little less than I expected.

The truck is, as I said, very comfortable and rides like a car.  I'm relatively pleased with the vehicle, but need to remember not to overload it.
