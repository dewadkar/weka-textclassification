            For those who care more about the go than the show, this is the car for you. Not to understate the appearance of this car, however conservatively styled, it has distinctive lines that clearly distinguish it from the Hondas and Toyotas of the world. The styling isn't the only difference, however. With a simple and relatively inexpensive modification to the car's computer, it is possible to increase the stock horsepower from 150 to 200. This makes for a very spirited ride. (available at goapr.com for around $400)

The quattro makes this car virtually unstoppable in the rain and snow. I would recommend a good set of snow tires (because even with all-wheel drive this car stops no more quickly than any other). But in the slippery stuff this car is superbly balanced, stable, and remarkably predictable. Skids that would be gut-wrenching in any other car instead plaster a goofy smile on your face.

I have experienced only three issues with this car in the time I have owned it. First, the waste gate (valve that regulates turbo boost pressure) failed, but the entire turbo unit was replaced under warranty. Second, some of the front end suspension components have worn out of spec. They were also replaced under warranty. Third, it's not so easy to fit a Thule rack on an a4. It can be done, but I've had a tiny leak around my driver's door seal since I put mine on.
