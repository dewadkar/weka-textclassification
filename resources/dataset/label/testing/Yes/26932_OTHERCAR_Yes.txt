            Reliability is the primary concern of any driver.  I drive my car a minimum of 75 miles a day and have yet to have any problems.  It is a 1998 Camry and its has been good to me.  The 4 cylinder engine has plenty of power and good fuel economy, which is very important since I put so many miles on it.  I enjoy the ability to fly up hills leaving others behind.  I have only one complaint about the car.  The front seems to be a bit low and on some dips I tend to scrape the bottom.  The Camry is a very good family car.  I have taken long trips with 4 or 5 of my friends and all were comfortable.  The ride and handling are very smooth and quiet.  I would recommend this car to almost anybody of any age.  It does not have the flash other cars might, but it might turn heads, with a few adjustments.<br><br>
