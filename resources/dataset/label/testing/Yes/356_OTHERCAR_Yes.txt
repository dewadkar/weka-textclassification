            Okay, This is my second Nissan.  Noted that the first one was a 240 and quite small.  After having two children, my husband and I decided to move into the &quot;Sports Utility Vehicle&quot; territory.

I have to say, the interior of the Xterra is a bit smaller than the Pathfinder (we tested out both).  I also find that once you get up to speed, you hear wind drag from both sides of the front doors.  Also, you also FEEL the wind coming in through the cracks of the door joints. 

Additionally, I also find that the windows are not well mounted.  It swagger from side to side when jiggle very easily.  Again, if you get up to speed and roll your windows half way down, you will notice it does rock from side to side in the wind.

Finally, the automatic shift stick is hard to drag to first/second/third gear.  I'm 5'4, 120lbs. and I have trouble with it.  I also have trouble pulling the back hatch close with one hand.  I also find the back seat cushion to be cheaply put together.  (You can see it once your pull the cushion out to get more room in the back).

I believe that in this day and age, Sports Utility Vehicles are owned by women as much as men.  I still think that this type of vehicle is geared towards the male gender rather than female.  I know, I know, its' a Sports Utility Vehicle for Pete's sake!  It's supposed to be &quot;rugged and tough&quot;.  Let me ask you one thing.  How many of you have taken your ride off-road?  Did you buy it for that purpose and that alone?  No, we all have to get to work, pick up kids, go grocery shopping and errands.  

Overall, I love my new truck.  I have no qualms about it.  I just wanted people to be aware of some of the defects (to me) that I've noticed.  If I had the option to return it, I wouldn't because of these few problems.  The benefits far outweighs the minor defects (again, to me).
