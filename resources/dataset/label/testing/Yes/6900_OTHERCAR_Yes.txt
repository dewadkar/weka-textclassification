            The 530i was at the top of the list of cars to drive when looking for a mid-size luxury sedan.  It sat atop the cache list with the Mercedes E-class, yet found itself alone when 'sport' sedan was the goal.  

Now, the E-class is certainly one of the most sophisticated sedans in the world, its 3 level suspension rivals the BMW ride, however when looking for a car that connects with the road and delivers unrivaled feel while still delivering timeless style and comfort the 530i is in a class by itself.

When testing the car, two options were available in the pricerange (43-48K).  Either a manual transmission or an automatic transmission.  Now most in this segment will choose the automatic for the simple fact that the luxury factor will lead them down this path.  We were worried about getting tired of the manual/clutch and not enjoying the miles toward the end of our ownership.  However, after spending little more than 2 min of our test drive in the manual, we were both convinced that the manual 5 speed (Motorsport) was one of the easiest to shift, smoothest tranny's we had ever driven.  

The ride on the 530i is spectacular.  The fit and finish inside the car produces no creaks or rattles from the interior even though the ride is firm.  I do say firm and not stiff for a reason.  BMW has produced a car with a suspension that eliminates body-roll in all but the most aggressive of situations without beating the passengers to death.  The 17' Continentals are certainly worth their weight in gold when it comes to grip and quiet operation, but do leave some to be desired when speaking in terms of durability and ride quality, but hey... they are high performance, low profile tires what do you expect?

The engine is by far one of BMW's finest.  Quality has never been a question in this line of cars, but the 530i's six cylinder has proven itself to be a class leader in durability and reliability.  

The leather seats are BMW firm and supportive.  Covered in fine, smooth leather with motorized leg support in the front, the seats are not 'plush' so to speak, but provide wonderful support and hold even in hard cornering.  You will not be disappointed with the interior craftsmanship.

To sum up, the best you can come up with (and the car magazines as well) to fault in this car is that its design is old.  In my book thats not much of an argument against it.  The design is still beautiful and looks ANYTHING but old when seen next to its contemporaries.  Classic lines, wonderful drivetrain, firm supportive interior, the business' finest transmissions... care to take a test drive?  It might be your last.
