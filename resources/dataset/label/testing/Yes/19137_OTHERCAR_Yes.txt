                After nearly four months of extensive research in buying a new car, I finally choose the Volkswagen Passat. It's an excellently crafted vehicle. I specifically purchased the GLS version, with a sunroof, trunk-mounted CD-player, black leather, alloy wheels, and wood trimmed interior. For a high (but nicely fit) price tag of $28,000 I felt that I had done well. We bought our car in satin silver. As of current, we've only had one minor problem with the gas line in our nine months of owning the Passat. It's almost like owning the bug, but with the extra room. 

    The car is simply beautiful and runs excellently on its four cylinders. (our friends purchased a V-6 which I must say was similar to that of driving a porche!) I'm completely satisfied with the car. The added features that make the car so excellent include: Tiptronic system (allowing the automatic car, become manual, which is SOOOOOOOOOOOO much fun.), also the air conditioned glove box (for nail polish, sandwiches, and the like), day-time running lamps, eight speaker sound system, and my favorite of all is the light up dash that illuminates a beautiful deep blue that is so attractive at night. 
    The car is smooth, fast, and excellently crafted. The re-designed Passat is a marvel of German machinery, and I HIGHLY recommend it for a family car, as my family enjoys it. The trunk space is superb, and the overall look of the car will age well with coming years. The seats are very comfortable, and driving the car is a dream. The one, and only thing I was upset over, was the fact that it took two months to get the car since it's in such high demand!!
