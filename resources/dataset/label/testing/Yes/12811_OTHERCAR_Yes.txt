            I bouht a Canon S20 in San Fran in June 2000 on impulse. I had been meaning to get my first digital camera for some months, but had delayed until resolution went up and price came down. I reckon now that point is reached.
I considered buying a Fuji 4.3Mp but preferred the Canon mainly because of the normal camera layout (hoizontal)and the flash unit not being motorised (something else to go wrong?). 
My only disappointment is that it does not come with a Rechargeable Battery and you have to buy that separately, and the rechargeable batteries themselves. However if like me you bought in the US to use in Europe that is better since the charge then comes with a European plug.
The ability to use ordinary Lithium batteries is great since if your rechageable runs down you can just buy another!
The quality is great; very easy to use - I had not used one before and was running in about an hour.
I like the product and cannot see anything I don't like so far.
