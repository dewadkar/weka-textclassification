            I am driving my 3rd Corsica.  It just turned 100,000 miles and is going strong.  I have driven Corsicas for 10 years and will never own another type car.  I have 2 children that have yet to destroy anything in the vehicle (and believe me, that is saying alot)! 

 We travel cross-country 3 times a year, and have even camped out in it when mom was too tired to drive another mile.  It gets excellent mileage (my car ranges 25 in town/33 hiway) and I burn regular (cheap!!) unleaded.  

I faithfully change the oil (okay, hubby does) every 3000 miles and have never had to have one serviced for anything other than normal wear and tear.  My insurance is great and except for a grizzly accident involving a psychotic deer, I have never been without my car.  The two older ones are still on the road, 200000 miles plus.  We gave them to a neighbor for his mother to drive and she loves it.  

It is a dependable, comfortable, and economical car for the long haul.  Ask my kids if you don't believe me!<br><br>
