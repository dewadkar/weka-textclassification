            I own a 1999 Honda CR-V. Since I live in Florida, it was not a pressing need of mine to have 4-wheel drive so I put that money into the luggage rack and keyless entry.

The CR-V handles very nicely, and being an SUV, gives you a far better view of the road and surrounding traffic. 

The only two drawbacks I see in it are (1) the leg room and (2) horsepower. Not everyone will have a problem with leg room - I am 6'3&quot; tall so I am not average height. I am not uncomfortable - I just know from driving other vehicles that I could be a bit more comfortable. As far as the horsepower - for city driving and moderate slopes it does just fine. And you'll avoid speeding tickets ...

All and all, considering the price and the Honda name - I'd rate this vehicle a terrific buy.<br><br>
