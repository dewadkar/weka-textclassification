            After much thought, it was time to buy a new car rather than repair the old Honda.  (That 1987 Accord served me so well, but that is another story).  Anyway, I did a lot of reading, a lot of thinking, and considered what were the things most important to me.
In addition to a good value/price, I was looking for something with style and class, that would also be fun to drive.  I would call this &quot;sporty economy.&quot;  

I knew I wanted a four door because of the baby seat, and I wanted a 5 speed manual transmission (my preference).  I also wanted a new car, if it was within my price range.
  
After looking at the Honda/Toyota/Nissan offerings, I checked out VW.  Started looking at the Passat, which was a nice car too.  But the Jetta GLS really got my attention.  It was a little smaller, sportier, more fun to drive.  It shifts very nicely.  And this one came with the luxury package, which I recommend.  It includes nice alloy rims, power windows/locks, and power sunroof.  At the time, they also threw in a free 6 disk CD changer to go with the Monsoon sound system, which is a great sounding 8 speaker system.  

I have now owned this car for four months, and driven a little over 5,000 miles.  I just had the first service/oil change, which was free!  This car rides and handles very well. 

The car looks sharp, with a black exterior, and grey interior.  The inside features a nice layout, comfortable, height adjustable seats, and everyone loves the blue lights on the dash at night.  People comment how nicely the car rides too.   

The dealership did a great job for me.  They gave me a good deal, which was below sticker and close to the invoice price (which I looked up on the Internet).  I am not sure they still offer all these incentives, because the car is selling so well.  VW also provides free service/oil change at the 5,000, 10,000, and 24,000 mile intervals.  

The four cylinder engine is OK in terms of power and acceleration, and very economical.  If you crave additional power, look at the 1.8 turbo or the six cylinder, which will cost you a bit more.

Overall, this is one great car that has all the features I was looking for at a bargain price.  Features that I like include the remote security system, 4 wheel disk ABS, tilt telescope wheel, front side airbags, cd changer, and all power accessories.  The standard feature list is very long - I won't go into it here.

If you are in the market for a sporty economy car that nicely balances practicality and fun, do yourself a favor and test drive the all new Jetta.  One warning - that test drive will most likely result in a purchase!!!<br><br>
