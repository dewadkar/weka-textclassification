            This is the second digital camera I bought - and it is a keeper!

What originally drew me to the camera was the size - that is it was relatively small so easy to carry. It also looks good with a simple square shape and metal finish. The LCD is also good and I have found easy to view in almost any light level.

I am a point and shoot photographer, so I appreciate the automatic setting that pretty much just lets me aim and the camera takes care of the rest. There are however ample manual settings for a more advanced photographer (i.e. intermediate). The menus are well laid out and easy to figure out what they are doing. And the documentation that came with the camera is excellent at explaining the settings and what they do - this is one manual I was able to read cover to cover and found very useful - i.e. I learn a lot.

One suggestion - the camera comes with a 8MB compact flash memory card. Unless you only want to take 10-20 shots, get a larger card - memory is cheap and it is a lot more convenient to just keep taking pictures than constantly be downloading them.

I have found the pictures to be very clear - it is a 2 Megapixel set up. If picture quality and detail are important you might want to consider the S230 (3 Megapixels, but less optical zoom). I find the 3X optical zoom very useful. The camera also comes with a panorama picture maker that works very well - I did a 360 degree shot of a room at Christmas and it came out really well. I found the software that ships with the product is first rate - and again there is good documentation. It was also very easy to transfer pictures using the USB attachment. One final feature I like is the self timer and attachment for a tripod - this is great for family pictures that you want to include yourself in.

One small thing I did notice is that if you turn off the flash, the image may appear to be bright enough in the LCD monitor - but the picture will be a bit dark. Be wared though the flash is bright!
