            If you want one word to describe the Ford F-350 i got one for ya...........MAMMOTH!!! Ford took all the stops out on this big ford! the horsepower on this truck is enormous! The horsepower for all the 350 models is about 260 horsepower @ 4500 rpms! thats incredible and the torque is phenomenal its about at 350 @ 2500 rpms.....thats really not bad!! its a very roomy truck unlike dodge or chevy and it comes with 4wheel ABS brakes and power windows and locks on all XLT and LARIAT models and we can`t forget about those XL models with bucket seating coming standard and for you guys that pull trailors....Ford replaced their old non-telescoping mirrors with telescoping trailer towing mirrors (try saying that 5 times fast!) This truck is definitely going under my book for the best truck i have ever laid my blue eyes on! <br><br>
