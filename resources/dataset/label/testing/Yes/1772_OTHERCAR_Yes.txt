            The Chrysler Sebring is one of the best cars I have ever driven. Not only is it a smooth ride but comes equipped with a great sound system and has extremely comfortable seats. Even the JX model has great pick up in a short space of time. It is a luxurious car when the tops on and a wicked fun car as a convertable! Another thing to consider when looking at convertables in how roomy they are. This is a great car for families. Even though it is a 2 door, there is plenty of room in the back seat. We have had to put car seats in the back many times and never had a problem with it. If you like fun in the sun, comfort, loud sounds, or speed, this is definatly a car that you should consider looking at when making your next purchase!<br><br>
