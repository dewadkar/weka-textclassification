            I fell in love while in college.  A couple of times actually.  Most of their names I have forgotten.  But its their faces that I remember and that�s just where I�m going with this�its the image that remains.  In fact the love that I discovered in college is still with me:  photography.

Nobody could waste a perfect summer day as I could.  Down in the cellars of the campus elbow deep in developer, stop baths and washes.  Occasionally emerging from under the red light of a darkroom into the daylight,  to look over a contact sheet or print.  I said someday I would have my own darkroom. I really said:  &quot;Someday my prints will come....&quot; Hey!  Thats a joke or a pun  Little levity going there..eh?

And now I do: its my computer, and my camera of choice isn�t a Nikon or Leica or any other SLR its a Sony Mavica MD83 digital and my film of choice is a 3.5 inch diskette.  Photography has turned into a virtually free hobby.  The Mavica is one of best gifts I�ve received in recent years.  Its crossed international borders, been on cruises and lent out to friends countless times.  I love this camera.

Don�t try to compare the output of 35mm print to a digital, the MD83 or otherwise.  You will be able to tell the difference.  There are two resolutions 800x640 and 1024x768 on the MD83.  Printing the hi-res shots on a 1440x720 dpi printer with a quality glossy paper gets pretty darned close to professional, though.

The camera also has a an imaging feature that I really enjoy:  an image control that allows you to take Black and white, sepia toned, positive and negative shots.  I like the battery design which permits about two hours of operation and allows for charges before the batter is completely worn down. If you are wondering about capacity I find that I can store about 50 -60 shots and the lower resolution and about 25-30 on high.

The zoom lens is the equivalent of a 35-110 telephoto.  You are able to do manual focusing, which I haven�t had much luck with, and an autofocus which works reasonably well in all lighting conditions.

Gripes?  Yes, a few.  The flash is almost useless.  I suspect the flash I  have is malfunctioning based on a few Mavica photos taken by others.  I get bluish washed out effect.  My other serious problem is using the camera in bright daylight.  The viewfinder is almost impossible to see.  I suspect that an accessory item like a hood to block out the light might take care of it, but so far I haven�t seen such an item.

Before you buy a digital with memory cards or in a format that requires downloading to your PC., consider the Mavica, its sturdy, takes  wonderful pictures and reduces what would normally be an expensive hobby to pennies.  Did I mention that on a recent cruise through the Panama canal I took about 500 shots?  That would normally be quite an expense with my 35mm SLR.  With the Mavica it was pennies.
