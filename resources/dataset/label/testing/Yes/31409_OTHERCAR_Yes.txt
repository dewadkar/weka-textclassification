            I purchased the Alero because I was looking for a American sports car look at a reasonable price.  It also helps to have a GMS price and a GM credit card which are nice incentives to go GM.  I wanted something more than a Chevrolet this time around.  The ruby red color with leather seats, CD, sunroof, gold trim and rear spoiler make this a very attractive alternative to the higher priced Toyota and Honda models.  

The car has a nice V-6 engine that has gotten so far between 25 and 29 MPG in a variety of driving distances.  The major drawback so far has been the air leak from the seal around a window on the rear door.  The first attempt to repair was not successful as the (same?)leak still exists.  

The wider tires make curvy roads easy to maneuver. I wish they would have put a light on the shifter indicator in addition to the indicator on the cockpit indicator.  Those who are too short to see over the steering wheel might have a hard time knowing what gear the car is in.  Potential accidents could occur if the car is in the wrong gear and the person steps on the pedal. 

I have only had the car for 17 days.<br><br>
