            I bought a 1992 Vigor in January, and I have to agree with most people posting responses on here it is indeed a sweet ride.

I am a student and limiting my driving to school and back, I still have put on nearly 7000 miles on it since end of January.  

With my old car i didn't even drive that much in a year. 

Unfortunately on campus so inexperienced driver hit me, causing some major damage.

After finding a good body shop, and near $3000 worth of parts and labor, two doors a bumper and color matching, i finally got it back.

The only problems I have with it are the back speakers are blown (which will be remedied soon) and I don't get that great gas mileage.

I read a previous post on someone getting 450 miles per tank, but i'm only getting about 290-300 miles.  I am wondering what can I do to a car with 122,000 miles on it to increase this low mpg.  Could having a 5-speed have a factor in this. (email me at zibby007@yahoo.com if you can help.)

But the things that basically everyone agreed upon are the features of the car.

excellent pickup for a sedan, nice stereo which i found out has an amp, all panasonic speakers, alpine headunit. nice alloy rims.

overall it is truly a high performance vehicle<br><br>
