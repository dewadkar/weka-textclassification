            If you ever had, liked, or admired a previous Jeep Grand Cherokee, then the newer model is definitely for you.  We owned a 96 Grand Cherokee and last year turned it in for a beautiful blue 2000 model.  This is not the best SUV on the road, but its a worth improvement from our previous model.  Here are the highlights.

Positive - The tire in the trunk is gone!  They finally figured out how to tuck it away under the floor.  The added space in the trunk is very appreciated.

Negative - Noisy!  When 4wd is engaged (vs. 2wd) the car is substantially more noisy with a low but pervasive growl.  Its not necessarily the most unpleasant sound, but you'll definitely notice when 4wd is engaged.  This is a change from the previous model.

Positive - The sunroof is integrated into the roof better...no more annoying wind noise!

Negative - What happened to the gas mileage??  Obviously you aren't buying one of these cars to get great mileage, but the previous model would average around 17 or 18 or so.  Now its closer to 14 or 15.  The car feels a little more powerful, but not with that kind of trade-off.

Positive - Interior design is substantially improved.  The knobs and radio have a good feel to them, and I still find the dash attractive.

Negative - A minor quibble, but the normal Jeep CD player seems to have a lot of problems playing recorded CD's (CD-R's).  This doesn't affect everyone obviously, but it is worth noting considering its such a new model.

Positive - Much better steering feel.  The old Jeep lacked that on-center feel, while the new one has greatly improved in that area.

Negative - Some minor electrical troubles persist - like the tendency for the doors to lock themselves during a car ride (even though the feature is turned off!)

Negative - The tendency to not completely switch from 2 to 4wd when desired.  After shifting it, you sometimes have to accelerate or decelerate to have it actually engaged.  I had the car parked in the street one day, switched it into 4wd because of the snow, and drove about a block.  When I then tried to go up a hill, I started sliding around because only the rear wheels were getting power.  When 4wd is engaged though, it seems to do a pretty good job.

There's definitely a mix of positive and negatives here, which outlines that this car is not perfect.  But in its price range, it is a great improvement over the previous model and can hold its own against any of the competition.
