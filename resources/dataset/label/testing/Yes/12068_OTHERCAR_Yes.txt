            When I first saw it I thought to myself this car isn't going to last for more than twenty thousand miles. When I got this car for 800 dollars and 150,000 miles both my step dad and I thought it was going to be a junker. Yet I'm at 211,000 miles now and my car is running better than ever. The car itself is very mechanically sound. A disadvantage is the looks aren't as sound. The headliner is drooping as it does in most pre 1993 saab cars. Outside, there is a bunch of rust. However if you care more about durability than looks this could be the car for you.<br><br>
