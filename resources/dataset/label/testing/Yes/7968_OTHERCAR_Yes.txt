            I own a 1997 Jeep Wrangler...LOVE IT...
Actually, I own two Jeeps, a 97 Wrangler Sport and a 95 Cherokee Country
The Wrangler kicks on snow, mud, and sand.  No quality problems to speak of other than the gas gauge never has and never will read &quot;F&quot; it has been recalled for this problem but the fix didnt work.  Anyway which is the most important side of the gauge? &quot;E&quot; you say &quot;E&quot; thats what I think too.
Rides as good as my Cherokee, not as fast, intake roar does not sound as good. Do not buy a 4 cyl. gas numbers are not much better but the performance sucks.  A great SUV for those who are more interested in impressing themselves rather than the masses.  Its not about sophistication here, its about a good solid performer.  This Jeep is to SUVs what Bruce Springsteen is to rock and roll - Honest, blue collar, no apoligies.<br><br>
