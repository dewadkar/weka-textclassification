Mazda protege SE, 2002

For 2002 Mazda increased the power of this highly rated compact sedan. They have done away with the 1.8-liter engine and replaced it by a 2-liters one that will develop 130 horsepower thus giving the Protege  8 more HP than its  predecessors.

The Protege comes in three different models, the base model is the SE, followed by the LX which comes equipped with the new 2-liters engine and the ES that you can upgrade to an ES GT and have a full load of features.

The Protege I test drove was an SE trim, so the following review will concentrate on this model.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Mazda Protege SE is the base model, Mazda did not upgrade the motor on the SE, it still has the same engine as last year, nevertheless it is a highly rated and very economical engine.

Also Mazda has made some changes in the interior of the Protege. They call OptiSpace, which will add more room in the inside cabin.

The curb weight of the Protege SE is 2431 LBS with a wheel base of 102.7 inches. The dimension of the car are: The length 174 inches, the width 67.1 inches and the height 55.5 inches.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As soon as I took place behind the steering wheel I also noticed another change in the inside of the Protege. Mazda has redesigned the radio cassette section of the dash. I do like this new design better, I thought that the one did had on the prior models was too confusing.

From the driverï¿½s seat you will have an excellent all around vision, I particularly like the fact that even though the Protege is a small car Mazda still installed a good size side view mirrors that will give the driver an
excellent view of on coming traffic an a minimal dead spot.

From behind the steering wheel all the gages are easy to see and all the controls buttons are also easy to see and reach.

The Protege SE is not what you would call a loaded car, the car I drove was a dealer loaner and had very little features. The basic features the SE comes equipped with are: Tilt steering wheel, AM/FM radio player, CD player and rear window defroster.

The car I drove had the optional air conditioning and ABS brakes added.

The space in the front seat is acceptable but it is a little restricted in the rear seat area.

The exterior:

I really like the lines and the front grill area  of the Protege, I think it makes for a smart looking vehicle.

The trunk space at 12.98 cubic feet of volume is quite respectable for a compact automobile.
