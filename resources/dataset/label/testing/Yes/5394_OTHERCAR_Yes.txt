              I just traded in my 2003 bmw 325 (without the sport package) --which was a great car-- for a 330 (with the sport package), which is an even better car.  The new ride is a bit pricier ($6,000 more), but well worth it, even with a disasterous start.  I had the new Beemer in the shop less than a week after I bought it because the transmission would not engage when first started in the morning for a period of 10 seconds to as long as almost a minute.  It turns out that there is a problem with the tranny and that it needs to be replaced--in this and other cars.  One has been ordered and should be arriving within the next month.  Luckily, once the car warms up, the tranny works fine, but needless to say, it was not a great way to start the new ownership experience.  BTW, I was shocked to learn that the 5 speed steptronic automatic transmission in this car is not German...it is a General Motors Transmission made by GM in France.  So much for paying a premium for fine German engineering.  I was told that some of the cars have the GM tranny and others have the German made ZF---I wish mine had the ZF!  
    Now, on to more important things, such as the incredible handling and ride combination this car gives.  The handling is absolutely fantastic.  I did feel that the ride on the stock Conti-sport tires was a bit harsh so I immediately replaced them with 4 Michelin Pilot Sport A/S (All Season) and the improvement in ride quality was immeasurable, with almost no degradation in handling ability.  In fact, I doubt you would even notice the extremely small difference in handling unless you drive on the track or are otherwise constantly pushing the car's limits.  Another added benefit of the Michelins is almost double the treadwear life of the stock Continentals, and drastically improved performance in the rain.
  The interior is classy and refined--the seats are comfortable---although I prefer the seating position on the non-sport package seats.  The Harmon Karden stereo is okay, but nothing to get too excited over. 
   Where the car shines is the handling.  It is simply a blast to drive...one of the best I've ever owned.  In fact, I prefer this car to my 2001 Jaguar XKR, which had 370 supercharged HP and a sleek, classy look.  THe Beemer is more tossable and really gives a much better feel for the road. You always have a grin on your face when driving this car!
  The extra power with the 330 is noticeable from that of the 325, but it will not overwhelm you by any means.  I had previously written about my 325 that it was not necessary to get the sport package as it handles well without it.  I must confess that the sport package makes these cars much more fun to drive...but the difference in engines is negligible--in fact, having driven both, I can't say that you really feel much of a difference at all...there is a difference, but not really much.  One of my gripes with the 330 is that it feels like it needs just a bit more oomph....maybe another 25 hp or so to really set it apart from the 325.  I suspect that there might be a more noticeable difference with the manual transmission, as it is supposedly quite a bit quicker.
  Another small gripe--the steering wheel does not tilt low enough...resulting in a driving position with your arms higher than is comfortable.  And that is about it for gripes (providing they get my tranny fixed sometime in the near future--as I write this, it has been over a month and still no new tranny)
  In summary, this is a fantastic car.  Drive one.  You will love it!
