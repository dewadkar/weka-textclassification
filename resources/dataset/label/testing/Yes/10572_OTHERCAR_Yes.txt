            I bought this product mainly because it was in my price range, despite the fact it had been recommended to me that I purchase a Canon. Well, Canon costs more, so the Vivitar became part of the family. And guess what? I am still glad I bought it because not only did a save a couple hundred dollars, but the Vivitar does what it should. It takes nice pictures, is quickly ready to take pictures out of the box, is not too complex, comfortable to hold, and the rechargeable batteries are great. One comment I would like to make is the fact that the batteries do seem to go quick, but if you don't do a lot of functions while taking photos, the batteries do make it until the memory is used up. 

I had little trouble with the software included with the camera, however I do recommend a program such as Photoshop (for perfectionists only)  to adjust the contrast and hue saturation, for this camera occasionally does(only when the batteries are extremely low) produce darkish photos when you take pictures outdoors at night. 

I believe this product produces excellent results outdoors and indoors where there is one light source. Multiple light sources are a bit not as excellent, however, I did this evening produce some very nice photos within Bronners of Frankenmuth, Michigan; which is a Christmas Store and intensely lit up. 

A comment on color: I am getting some very true reds and blues, and I feel this is one of the best aspects of this camera. 

I would recommend this camera for first time digital camera purchasers such as myself, and would even go a bit further to say this camera would satisfy most in performance.
