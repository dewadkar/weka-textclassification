            Dear reader,

If you are looking for a great affordable car you must consider this. I am a middle aged man, but I like cruising arond like I once did as a teenager. This car enables me to do this. 
In this car you have a quality fm / am stereo, as well as a cd player. The car also runs fabulously. It is SO smooth. When in the car, it feels like I am gliding. 
This car is also very durable. I have had mine for about two years now and I have yet to take it into the shop for major problems. With past cars, I have had tremendous bills from the auto shop, but it is so much different with this fine tuned machine.
Last of all, this car has the total package for a very affordable price. I bought mine for under 12 g's. I highly reccomend this car. 
If you liked this review, please take the time to review some of my others. I also would be very appreciative of comments.
