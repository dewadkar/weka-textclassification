            My wife and I are the proud owners of a 1994 Dodge Shadow base 4-door.  I bought the car a few months back as a 'spare' car.  We always keep a third car just in case we have a problem with the main two, and to offer a run-around vehicle for errands and trips to the hardware store to keep from damaging our newer, much more costly cars.

Anyway, I work in a dealership and took this car in on trade.  An older lady owned it, and it had obviously seen some care in it's day.  Other than being dirty, the car ran well and she had a lot of documentation on services performed on it.  The car currently has about 77,000 miles on it.

As I mentioned above, we bought it as a 'spare' car, but recently my wife totalled her new car, so she's been driving the Shadow to work.  I have been new-car shopping for her, but she is adamant that she will just drive the Shadow because she likes it so much.  

This car is super basic, with very little acceleration from either a dead stop or in motion.  However, basic is not a bad thing in a cheap car, and my opinion is that it translates in less things to break on us.

I would never have given up $8000+ for this car, but as a used car I think it represents a HUGE value for the money.  I know many who have literally put 150,000+ miles on 2.2L powered FWD Chryslers with very little in the way of maintenance and repair.  

In the time my insurance company has been working out our settlement, we figure that the savings on the cost of a rental car has nearly paid for this car already.  How can you argue with that????

As an example of how much we both enjoy the car, on the way to dinner tonight we both simultaneously walked past our $28,000 supercharged Frontier Crew Cab to take our $1200 Shadow instead.  

If you need a good buy on a used car that you can depend on, I think the Shadow/Sundance twins are worth looking at.  In addition, the commonality of the drivetrain means no costly repairs.  We haven't gotten huge fuel economy from ours, but I think it's ready for a tune-up and it's still giving us about 25mpg combined.  For a car that doesn't have overdrive (ours is the 2.2L/3-speed automatic combo) I guess that's pretty good.

Shadow=good.  Drive=like (it's hard to say LOVE about it :)
