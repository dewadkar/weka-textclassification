            I recently bought this 1990 Maxima used after wrecking my other car. We paid $2500 which, though we didn't know it at the time, was a steal. The blue book value on a car, even with over 200,000 miles, was $4500. However, not three months after I owned the car, the transmission started slipping. It was very interesting to note that although it had been slipping for a few weeks, it still held together long enough for me to drive it over 65 miles to a repair shop. Apparently, the mechanic at Speedy Transmission told me that over time, the Maximas have a problem with the planetary pins, three of them, that eventually turn enough to drop straight through the frame! This has been remedied by recessing the pins and capping them, so I have been told I will never have to bring the transmission back in for repairs. And it would not be unusual, said the same mechanic who showed me EXACTLY how the repair work was done, for the engine itself to run practically forever. That being said, the car itself hasn't had too many other problems, except for the sunroof not opening all the way, the odometer sticking at times, and the two button clock going dim at times. But hey, for a car that's a little over 200,000 miles, this car is STILL going. And the engine, man it is so quiet you literally have to be on top of it to hear it running. We use the BG Moa engine treatment to keep this sucker in tip top shape, and if you change the oil every three thousand miles AND the fuel filter every fourth oil change, you shouldn't see any significant problems in the car. Very comfortable and roomy, even on a 3 and a half hour trip to Savannah occasionally (every couple of months) I am not going to see back pain or cramps! And for some reason, even for a 13 or 14 gallon tank, 320 to 330 miles before I have to fill up the tank again is not a bad thing for me. I'm estimating around 23 to 26 miles per gallon, which for a V6 is just fine. We Atlanteans do a LOT of highway driving anyway.
