            The 240 and I go way back - I've owned a couple over the years and in between being in the shop they are great cars.  The 240 dates back to the early 70's so the mechanicals are fairly well sorted out including the venerable B21 engine and 4-speed overdrive transmission.  Here's an interesting fact - when Volvo wanted to move from a 4-speed to a 5-speed transmission for the 240, instead of redesigning one from scratch they took the old 4-speed and added a separate overdrive unit for the 5th gear.   Although their intentions were honorable (trying to leverage the reliability of the existing 4-speed), the result was questionable.  What this means from a maintenance standpoint is that you'll be replacing a lot of little overdrive switches and relays (they tend to be a little fickle) if you opt for the manual Volvo.  Also, the transmission service is a little tricky.  You need to replace the transmission with gear oil, but the external overdrive unit gets ATF (better make sure your mechanic knows this).  You can chew up the delicate overdrive with gear oil.  

Although the 240 is among the safest rated (non-airbag) cars, it seems to be all the little things which need attention, none of which are cheap to repair, unfortunately.  Here are the typical problems I encountered during my 90,000 miles of Volvo driving:

Heater core, blower motor, logic box, wiring harness, the infamous battle of brakes (Girling vs. ATE - will the parts guys ever get this one right?), lower control arm bushings, steering rack, overdrive relays and switches, power window regulators, leaking sunroof (to name a few).

Now granted, after several years and 176,000 miles on my Turbo 240 I had replaced all this and then some to the tune of 2.5 times what I paid for it.  But it was still cheaper than a car payment.  The good news is I still managed to get what I originally paid for the car when I finally sold it ($2500).  People are nutty about these cars (including me).

The non-intercooled Turbo in my 84 4-door was surprisingly reliable and was original and working perfectly when I sold it.  I was told that frequent oil changes are the best preventative maintenance for aging Turbos. I also ran Mobil 1 in the crankcase as well as Premium in the tank.  I actually miss the car at times.  It is a distinctive shape and had all the features - leather, sunroof, power windows, etc.  And in the winter - put a set of Bridgestone Blizzaks on and you've got yourself one mean Swedish snowmobile, in spite of the rear wheel drive.  

If you end up buying any Volvo you MUST, I repeat MUST add the ipd Safety Swaybars - the difference is incredible.  These are manufactured by a company out in Portland, OR (www.ipd.com) and they are the best Volvo add-on available for safety and improved handling performance.  

Overall, the 240 is like an old uncle - a little dated, but classic and kind.  240s are available in many flavors - my personal favorite would be the 84-86 Turbo wagon with the 15&quot; alloys.  Plus, if the motor ever went bad you could then justify the ultimate Volvo upgrade - a Mustang 5.0 V-8 transplant.  There's a company in the northeast that does the conversion - it fits perfectly.  When mated with a Mustang T-5 5-speed transmission, you'll have the pimply cruisers stumped for days when you blow them away off the line.
