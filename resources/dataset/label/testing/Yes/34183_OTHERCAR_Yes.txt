            GLS V6 Model

Interior : The interior is well finished. The looks inside is very clean. The leather seats are very nice, but since this car didn't have power seating it was a hassle to adjust the seat to my favor. The center console is somewhat difficult to access, because there's quite a bit of buttons and knobs. The back seat provided good amount of room for 2 adults. Overall, it's nice.

Exterior : To me the exterior is good. The silver paint finish gives off a nice shine. The front lights are attractive. The back lights are bland. The wheels look pretty nice too. I'm not a big fan of rounded shape cars, so I'm not really attracted to this car.

Driving Impression : The first thing I noticed when driving this car was that it has a lot of power. It was really surprising, because the car is ridiculously quiet and smooth. When I'm on a 25 mph road and I always find myself driving 60 mph. The shifter on the car is very precise and easy to shift, however it's a little bit difficult to tell if the shifter is locked into its gear. The clutch is pretty short, so there's little effort in pushing it in. The bad part about the car is that it there seems to be a lot of body roll. When turning at corners the car feel like its tilting a lot. Overall, this car is great for long rides. It's really silent. Great at deflecting the wind noise. Ride is very smooth. I recommend it to anybody who's looking for a car just for regular transportation, but definitely not for sports car enthusiasts.
