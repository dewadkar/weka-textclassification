            I am driving my second Chevy Extended Cab Z71.  My first was a '93 model.
Now I have a 1998 with the third door.  Excellent!  Not only is it a good looking truck, it has lots of power with the Vortec 350 engine.  The interior has Captain's Chairs cloth seat covers, AM/FM CD/Casset player.  When we traded in the 93 model the trade in value was much more than we expected.
Cars depreciate so quickly!  I know some people are very much &quot;car people&quot;
but I love my truck!  My husband and I have a &quot;mixed marriage&quot; (he drives a Ford.} I like the Chevy much better, you see I was raised Chevy. I don't see myself driving a car again.  I love the advantage of being able to see over traffic.  I am above tire level of 18 Wheelers.  I feel very safe but not agressive in my 4 wheel drive. I know SUV and 4 wheel drive owners sometimes think they are invincable but I know the potential danger of driving too fast. The weather in our area is generally not too bad.  But it is there when I need it. 
 We have a fifth wheel trailer which my Chevy has no problem pulling. The gas milage was about the same.      <br><br>
