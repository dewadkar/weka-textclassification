                Replaced aging 4200 lb 6 cyc.gas guzzlering van for a 2300 lb 4 cyc. gas guzzlering "economy" car. That is what i should have written on my other wise enjoyable first new car of mine. 
    Now that i got my one really only gripe out in the open, let me tell you about my new Rio Cinco!I bought the Rio about two months ago and have about 2000 miles on it now and it has been a very good so far, no problems at all other than i have done my math and have discovered im getting about 20 miles to the gallon tops! Its a shame since the car, especially the Cinco model, is a smooth riding, pretty roomy car thats not only cheap but good looking as well. 
    After the transmission on my 1992 astro van went, i decided it was time for my first new car! Im almost 35, about time huh? Well since i am still making payments on my 1998 Mercury Villager i had to buy something cheaper and the Rio fit the bill. I picked the Cinco model because it has a really alot of room with the hatchback and even though the tail of Rio sedan is gooding looking as it is i think the Cinco'c tail end is even nicer. 
    It has a rather simple dashboard but has all you need and the model i got has all but one of the options available which is antilock brakes. Other than that my model has power locks, a am/fm cd player, cool alloy wheels, a/c, automatic, 60/40 split fold down rear seats and a tach all for a tad over 13,000.00. The Cinco can be had for 2000.00 less but its too stripped down then in my opinion. 
    The car feels more powerful than a 96 horsepower 1.5 liter engine  would suggest. Acceleration is pretty good but once you put the a/c on, the car loses alot of power, to the point where it would be wise not to put yourself in the postion where quick acceleration is needed e.g. pulling out in front of fast oncoming cars!  
    Now the one thing that i think is a big problem; the lousy gas mileage! The car is rated at 25 city and 30 hwy which is in itself not too impressive, but im not even getting near those numbers. I thought at first maybe the car would get better gas mileage once it was broken in, but now i have 2000 miles on it and the most i have gotten out of a full tank of gas (12 gallons) is a tad over 220 miles which means you get to know your local gas attendants by first names since you will find your self at the gas stations alot! I have read other reviews on the web on the Rio and some other people have said the gas mileage was a problem too. It would be expected if the car was heavy or had a out dated engine but the Rio has a fairly modern engine (DOHC, 4 valves per cyc.)  
    The warrenty is great, 5 years bumper to bumper, 5 years roadside assistance, 10 year, 100,000 mile powertrain warrenty with no deductable! No other automaker except Kia's parent compnay Hyundai can come close to that!
