            My sister in law has a 1992 Pontiac Grand Am, and I drive it frequently when we go somewhere together since she does not like to drive. I'm really pleased with the performance of this car.

It gets about 30 miles per gallon which is not bad. It runs smoothly and gets us wherever we need to go with no mechanical problems along the way.

You can seat 5 people comfortably in her car, and the seats are comfortable to ride in. It has a four cylinder engine, that runs great despite the high mileage on the car.

There are very few drawbacks to this car. The one thing that bothers me the most is the automatic door locks. I know that they are put there for safety, but I also know someone who accidently locked their baby in the car because of them. That was a scary experience!

The other problem with this car is the paint quality. Nearly half of the paint is peeling from the trunk of her car. Apparently, the paint was of a poor quality and did not last.

I have considered buying myself a Pontiac Grand Am, but if I do, I will have the door locks disabled.<br><br>
