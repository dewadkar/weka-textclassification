            I was able to test drive a new 2004 Saturn VUE AWD V6 about 50+ miles while my other Saturn (a 2003 L300) was in for service.

The car I drove was silver with the gray leather interior. Along with the leather, it also had the 6-CD changer, the side curtain airbags, power seats and the floor mats as options. Sticker price was just over $26,000. There was a dealer added sticker (pinstripes and a couple of other things that I do not remember) that bumped the asking price to over $27,000.

First impressions were good. The 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels fill out the wheel wells much better than the 16-inch wheels from last year. Plus, I like the plain spoke pattern -- for some reason, the pattern of the 16-inch wheels turned me off. The rear hatch has been redesigned slightly for 2004. The lift handle is now matte black with a large SATURN engraved into it. This is much more noticeable than the 2003s. Other than that, I did not see any major differences with the 2003 - very clean looking, IMO.

The silver of the vehicle I drove (it was actually the sales managers demo) is a fairly neutral color -- the dealer had lots of AWD V6 models on the lot in all colors. The bright blue and the green appealed to me; I am not real keen on white or black, while the orange was just odd. 

Opening the door gave me the first opportunity to see the new for 2004 interior. I had sat in an 2003 once or twice and was less than impressed &#150 a fairly generic Saturn interior greeted me. The 2004 was a (slightly) different story. The redesigned gauges were quite handsome -- I really liked the chrome bezel around each dial, though the cream of the background was a bit too yellow for my liking. Still and all, a definite improvement over last year. The rest of the interior seemed the same as before -- the same weird positioning of the power window switches (after a year with my L300, I still find myself looking for them on the drivers door), a similar (though not exactly the same) stereo controls. One other item I found odd was that the power mirror controls and the rheostat (which controls the brightness of the dashboard and interior lights) were also on the center console, just under the center vents. There are no controls on the dashboard on either side of the steering wheel. That would certainly take some getting used to.

The seat was pretty much adjusted for me, so I am guessing that the sales manager who drives it daily is about my height (5 feet 11 inches). The captain chairs with the separate armrests are a nice touch, but unfortunately my girth prevented me from using the one on my seat as it was intended.

The engine starts up and settles into a nice, quiet idle. But, man, exercise your right foot and prepare to be amazed! That 250-hp, Honda sourced V6 just powers that VUE like you would not believe! The transmission seems to be optimized for the torque and power peaks that the engine provides. It is hard not to stick your foot into it as you zip away from every signal and stop sign. I would imagine that it kills the gas mileage, however...

The ride is nice and compliant, as well, with enough cornering stick to make the off ramps fun. It rides like a larger vehicle -- smooth tracking on the highway, with a firm, but not overly stiff, ride on surface streets. 

In our house, the standard of comfort the wife and I use is "Could we see ourselves taking this vehicle to Las Vegas?" (Las Vegas is 775 miles from us on mostly empty interstate highways). For me, at least, the jury is still out. The seat, while power operated, seems to be a bit short on seat cushion length for me. Other than that, I had no problems getting comfortable. If I used the cruise control liberally, then I can see doing a 12 hour stint without too much fatigue.

I was quite impressed with the amount of room in the rear seat. Even though our kids are teenagers and rarely ride with us, we do sometimes have folks back there, and it&#146s nice to know that there is enough room for legs, feet, arms and shoulders. I cannot imagine three people back there -- it just does not seem wide enough. Two, though, could be comfortable for a several hour trip.

The area behind the rear seats is certainly not as large as in our 2002 Explorer, but for a small "cute-ute" SUV, it really is not too bad. I really like the contraption that unfolds from the floor that allows groceries to be corralled without having stuff roll all about.

The wife liked it quite a bit, especially the amount of power. She definitely likes vehicles that can get out of their own way and the VUE certainly fits that description.

Is a VUE in our future?  Hard to say. We have a few months (well, 7 or 8) to make our decision, so we have plenty of time to think about what we want. The Subaru Forester XT is something that we both would like to drive (though the wife is not as keen on the looks -- too much station wagon in her words).  We also want to take a closer look at the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute twins and the new Chevrolet Equinox. But, if first impressions are anything to go buy, the VUE seems to be a strong contender, at least this early in the game.
