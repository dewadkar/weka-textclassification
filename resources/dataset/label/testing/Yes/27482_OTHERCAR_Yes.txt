            The Powershot Pro70 has been a very reliable camera for me.  I first received this camera in April of 1999.  Since then I have taken around 6000 photos.  This being my first digital camera, I can tell you that it is wonderful not being under the burden of having to pay for film and developing.  Since the only consumable item is the battery, which is good for around 300 charges, I figure that I can get about 15 photos per penny.

In Automatic mode this camera takes photos at 1536 x 1024 in either high or low quality.  The quality setting modifies the compression level that the JPEG photos are stored with.  Depending on the amount of detail in an image the included 8 MB Compact Flash card holds around 15 - 20 shots at high quality and 30-40 at low quality.

In Program mode you can also take photos at 768 x 512 again at high and low resolutions as well as high and low quality.  You can also take photos in CCD RAW in this mode.  The 8MB CF card holds around 60-80 low-res shots at high quality, 120-160 low-res shots at low quality, and only about 4-5 shots in CCD Raw Mode.

I highly advocate purchasing additional memory unless you want to be tethered to a PC to download shots every few minutes.

For those who have extreme storage requirements, this camera supports the 170MB and 340MB IBM MicroDrives.  One of these drives occupies both CF Card slots.  I personally use a 40MB and the 8MB CF Cards.

On the negative side, I have found that the autofocus time on this camera is extremely annoying.  Because of the 2-6+ second autofocus delays, you can right off taken action photos with this camera.  Unless of course, you can predict the area where you will want to take the photo and pre-focus on that spot.

Total cycle time (time between shots) for me has typically been 4-6 seconds.  This includes typical autofocus time (2-4 seconds and about 2-3 seconds to compress and store JPEG imagery.

I have never used the included serial cable.  If you want to use this camera go out and buy a CF Card reader for your PC.  I use the Sandisk ImageMate USB.

The lens cap should really have been on a leash.  Last Christmas I lost my lens cover while visiting relatives.  It has yet to be found.  I will be purchasing the soft cover for the camera, but until then keep a UV Filter on at all times.

I eagerly await Canon's response to the Olympus 2500.  The Powershot Pro70 is a great camera, but being almost 12 months old, it is no longer at the cutting edge of technology.
