            I was lucky enough to have a 1988 Acura Integra handed down to me by my mother on my 16th birthday.  Sometimes, you don't appreciate a gift as much as you should, and I certainly didn't appreciate this car like I should have.

From the time I was a child I knew that whatever car my mother had when I turned 16 would become <i>my</i> car, provided I had a job, and paid for my own insurance.  This was never a problem for me because I am a work-a-holic, so even when I was making $5.25 an hour, I still had enough to pay for insuring this car.

When my mom bought the car in 1988, I loved it.  Five years later, when it was handed over to me, the honeymoon was, for the most part, over.  Sure, I was excited to be given keys for the first time, and <i>yes</i> I did appreciate that it was a free car, but I didn't think it was <i>that</i> great of a car.  It seemed like all my friends had brand new cars (which they did) that were so much better than mine (which they weren't).  My friends had new Geos, Neons and Saturns.  I had a used Acura.  I now realize how laughable my opinions were at the time, but I really thought they had better cars.

My 1988 Acura was mine until 1999, when I bought my first car on my own.  I got in two major accidents with my car (both when I was a new driver) and thanks to the crumple zones in my car no one was hurt.  (I even had six people piled in my car during one of the accidents, I cannot believe no one was injured!)  As far as repairs go, I only had to repair the routine things, like the brakes and the exhaust, until after the car was 10 years old.

At about 10 years old, I had my first real problem with my Integra, when I noticed a small bit of oil under my car.  I took it to the honda dealer (because there are no Acura dealers within an hour of my house) and they told me the head gasket had a leak.  After hundreds of dollars, and literally DOZENS of visits to Honda, I decided to sell the car.  I am not exactly sure what happened, but I brought my car to Honda for a small leak, and I ended up with a car that ate (and then deposited on my garage floor) 2-3 quarts of oil a day once it was &quot;fixed.&quot;  The worst experience I had due to Honda's horrible service was that my car stalled on a major highway, when I had a tractor-trailer behind me!  I could have been killed because of those fools!  Luckily, by the grace of God, I wasn't hit, but I was very late for work.

I think that had I never taken my car to the Honda dealership, I never would have had the problems I did, and I would still be driving that car today.  Other than the supposed head gasket leak, and body work that was the result of my inexperienced driving, I never made a major repair on my car.  

I am tickled pink with my new car (read my reviews on the Volkswagen Jetta) but I still miss my old car and wonder about her, six months after I let her go.  Other than the fact that my Integra was low maintenance, it also got good gas mileage (especially for an old car), and still looked stylish, even though it was so old (if it wasn't for the flip-up headlights, I swear you wouldn't know when the car was built!)

I now realize what a great car my Integra was, and highly recommend that people check out the Integras when looking for a new or used car.  

BTW, I looked at the new Integras at the time I bought my Jetta, and if 
it wasn't for the price, I think I might have been an Integra owner for life.  I am not sure what my next car will be, but something tells me that it will be a Volkswagen or and Acura.  If it is an Acura, I promise I will never take it to the Honda dealership for repairs. :)    <br><br>
