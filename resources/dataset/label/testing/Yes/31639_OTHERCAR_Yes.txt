            Pros in more detail:  Sharp body style and unique.  It's one of a kind.  Interior is very roomy and comfortable, although I must admit, for the size of the car, could probably have more room inside.  Nice quiet engine that barely makes a sound when going even up to speeds such as 65 miles per hour.  The engine is a powerful V6 3.8 with the option of a supercharged.  I have the supercharged version and it puts out 240 horses of power.    It also has a lot of options inside which makes it nice.  Some of the options are a heated drivers seat, traction control, anti-lock brakes, electronic memory seats.  This car tells me the outside temperature and has a digital compass built into the electronic night vision rear view mirror.  It also comes with a CD player/tape deck combination and an awesome sound system.   So far, this car has never given me any problems.  My car has about 47000 miles on it and still drives exactly the same as a brand new car.  

Cons in more detail:  In all honestly, even though there are some cons, I would give this car a 9 out of 10 scoring because it's awesome to drive. Steering the car is something that you have to get used to because it almost feels artificial.  It almost seems like I am steering a boat.  Don't try doing the one hand steering technique when you start out driving this car because it could be hazardous to your health.  The body of the car is also very long and big.  It ways approximately 3700 pounds.  The fact that it's long and curvy makes it difficult to judge how close you are to things in the front and the back.  Because the car is big and boaty, it also doesn't handle fast turns that well.  The solution to these cons are really simple.  Take turns and parking with care.  The only other con is that this car is no longer made.  This was Buick's best car and now they are left with cars that all look the same and feel the same when driving them.  I keep waiting for Buick to come out with another car that compares with the Riv, but so far, no dice.  Buick definately needs something that will spice up their sales as it has declined for them over the last decade.
