<TEXT>
            I bought my Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1993 (new).  I leased it and thought when the lease was up I would just get something else.  Well I fell in love with it and I still have it today.  It was not cheap but it has had a very good maintenance record.  I have not really had any major problems with the vehicle.  I have 6 cylinder, 4x4.  It rides better than some of the other 4x4's that I testdrove, it handles nicely when cornering and the gas mileage is pretty good overall.  We tow the jeep behind our RV and have had no problems doing this.  This jeep has been all over the US and back and it's still ticking.

I would certainly buy another one if this one falls apart.  When my lease was up I of course being attached to this dream of a 4x4 bought it outright and have kept it ever since.<br><br>
