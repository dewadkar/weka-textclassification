            Okay, so you�ve heard how fun they are, and what a great value they are. To tell you the truth, even I got sick of all the same comments. Now I�m making those comments! In August of last year, I purchased a �99 Silver Miata with the sport package and cloth interior. The package steps up a base Miata to include a Nardi leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15� alloys with the Michelin Pilots, Bilstien shocks, Torsen limited-slip differential, front air dam and rear spoiler. I opted NOT to get the A/C, power windows, doors, mirrors, etc. In fact, the only power item on my car is the steering. I had to get that because finding one without power steering was next to impossible. I wanted to go for the bare-bones, open-air motoring experience and boy did I get it! The weight savings allowed me to attach a Hard Dog Hard Core to my roadster adding a great measure of safety and increased body rigidity. This package also allowed me to purchase what I feel is a very sporty (if not sports) car for under twenty grand. 

A word about performance�
Speaking of rigidity, this car is solid. It really shows that this car was designed as a roadster and not a converted coupe. The handling is so predictable that it takes some getting used to, depending on what you drove previously. The brakes could benefit from ABS (an option) but are more than satisfactory given the extreme light weight of this vehicle. The variable-assist power steering really tightens up at higher speeds sometimes making it hard to remember that I unwillingly opted for the option. The handling on this car is phenomenal. With lateral acceleration of over .90g�s, it is very difficult to make this car lose it�s composure. The fact that it�s rear wheel drive was a major reason why I bought this car and I am reminded everyday what a great benefit this is. By modulating the amount of throttle coming out of a tight turn, one can truly test the limits of this vehicle (not that I feel I have come close to that yet). It is almost a shame to get this car as an automatic. The short throws of manual shifter are so precise, it is easily the greatest feature of a car packed with great features. The 1.8 liter dohc 140hp engine is strong enough to allow one to enjoy the car without having too much power (if such an animal exists) to get into trouble with the authorities. The high-revving engine must be pushed beyond 5,000rpm to fully appreciate the added bonus of variable valve timing. Although it may feel like you�re punishing the engine, the power really seems to pour on after 5,700 rpm. I�ve heard complaints that the engine is noisy and the exhaust is noisy. I don�t feel these are valid arguments since a quite ride should not be on top (or anywhere) on your list of features when buying a roadster, especially one with a high-revving engine and a total weight of less than 2,300 pounds. What are they thinking?

On to the features�
The manual top has been perfected by Mazda. From the seated position, the top can be raised or lowered in less than 8 seconds thanks to the fact the glass rear window does not have to be unzipped in order to avoid scratches as in the previous generation Miata. With mild wind noise at freeway speeds, the top does a very good job blocking out the wind and the occasional rain. It is important to put on the top boot on the retracted top as soon as possible since it does not take the u.v. rays long to damage the exposed interior lining of the top. I�m not a little guy. I weigh 200 pounds and one inch short of two yards. The sitting position is just right. In fact a Boxster owner actually preferred the sitting position of the Miata to that of his own car. Although the car lacks a tilt steering wheel, the instrument pod is perfectly situated so that I can see all of the gauges clearly through the steering wheel. The seats could benefit from more side bolstering especially given the kart-like handling of these cars. The HVAC and radio controls are at your fingertips (heck, the passenger side window crank is at your fingertips!). One big sore spot, the cup holder. I wish they would either come up with a practical one, or do away with the marketing gimmick. If you plan on shifting, forget using the cup holder. I got to admit though, it works really well when the car�s not moving. I figure if this is the only design flaw I mind. I�ve found that the tiny Miata is a very livable car. To give you an idea of how livable, I�ve accumulated over 27,000 miles in a span of 10 months and am loving the car, even stuck in freeway traffic. Now that�s saying a lot!

Fit and finish�.
This car is solid. Don�t let it�s diminutive size fool you into thinking that squeaks and rattles are par for the course. The doors and trunk could benefit from some sound deadening material (such as Dynamat) but I could not believe the solid feel of this car given it�s size. Okay so I said solid twice (three times now) but I cannot think of a better word to describe the feel of this roadster.
I have yet to drive an MR Spyder (the only real competition for the Miata). I have heard that the braking and acceleration are better than that of the Miata. The Miata did edge out the Spyder in lateral acceleration but by a very slim margin. I for one still have not gotten used to the Spyder. It would be hard to deny the fact that the Miata revived the roadster craze we�re experiencing now and did it by earning accolades from the consumer and media. While there may be better performing roadsters currently available (Boxster, S2000, Z3, Corvette), there are none that offer such a complete package for such a small investment as the Miata. 

Word of warning, do not go test drive the Miata, especially on a sunny day. You won�t have a chance of not buying one! Let's see, who should buy this car? If you're looking for an extremely fun, agile, reliable, impractical car and not interested in driving a brand (especially German), then this car is for you. Keep in mind that you ARE buying a two-seater. Don't be amazed at the 5 cu. ft. trunk space and the level of noise. You will need all your amazement to cope with the level of performance afforded by this vehicle.
