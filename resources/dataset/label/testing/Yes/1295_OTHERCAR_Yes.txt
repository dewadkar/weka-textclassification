            This is my first 4Runner, and my first Toyota.  I have owned about ten other cars and trucks before this.  I chose my 1997 4Runner SR5 4x4 V6 because my wife needed something with some room and I wanted something reliable.  We both wanted something fun and sporty.  The 4Runner was perfect.

It has performed flawlessly during the last 50,000 miles.  We have only added oil changes and a set of tires (we have the off-road package that includes larger front brakes that seem to last a long time).

Pros: The reliability has been perfect.  The build quality, even under the car, is very well engineered and solid.  The engine is strong (for a V6).  The steering is very accurate and not &quot;floaty&quot; on the corners.  The brakes are powerful.  The chassis is durable and the suspension can take a beating without bottoming out.  The 4x4 has extensive steel skidplates for off-road use.  High ground clearance. The rear window retracts into the tailgate.  Good outward visibility, excellent large mirrors.

Cons: The ride is bumpy (with the 265/70-16 tires).  Fuel economy is averaging about 17 mpg overall.  The seats are too low and soft - not enough back support.  The 4x4 is part-time with open differentials.

The 4Runner was designed to be used as much off-road as on-road.  With that in mind, it is a durable true off-road vehicle that performs admirably on the highways.  It's very fun to drive.
