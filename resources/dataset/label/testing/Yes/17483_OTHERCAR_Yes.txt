            The 2002 Kia Sedona is a miracle for young families on a tight budget. For $24995 (Canadian Funds) you get a 195 Horse Power engine in a van with more standard features than you can shake a stick at! With the best warranty in the business, free basic maintenance for 12 months and a free Shrek video, this van is arguably the best value in a crowded marketplace.

This vehicle is QUIET! At 65 MPH there is no wind whistling and it drives straight and true. The standard 5 speed automatic transmission is not clunky, shifts are seamless and the location of the shift knob is akin to a Lexus!

The power steering is precise with virtually no over-steer on corners and body roll in kept to a minimum - this KOREAN van drives like the Toyota Sienna. It is essentially a CAMRY in van form for thousands of dollars less than the competition.

Sheet metal overlap is sealed with a silicon bead, thereby eliminating the likelihood of rust. The only other car maker that does this is Toyota. The seats are easily removable and reasonably light. The dual sliding doors roll with ball bearing smoothness and the standard rear heater and air conditioning is a god send.

The Kia Sedona will have a HUGE impact on the price of minivans. Look for 2003 models of competitors minivans to have lower sticker prices and tons more standard features!
