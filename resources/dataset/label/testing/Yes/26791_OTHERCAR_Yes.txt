            During the test drive (V-6) I was immediately impressed with the power this vehicle displayed and the smoothness of the ride.  Much better than my 93 V-6 stick shift Nissan pickup that I traded for it.  It  also handles and feels more like a car than a truck.

I've heard complaints over excessive engine noise, but I found that only occurs during passing or hard acceleration.  Normal driving noise is much less than my pickup. 

One of the first things I noticed is the lack of a tip over warning sign on the driver's visor.  For me this is a big plus.  I drove it through some pretty tight turns and it hugged the road like a car.  

The dash layout is excellent but why did they put the window controls on either side of the shift lever?  You get used to it in no time, however.

The interior is quite spartan in its overabundance of plastic, but for me that's a plus.  If the door panels get dirty a simple swipe with a warm damp cloth eliminates the grunge.  This is an SUV afterall, not a car.

Another plus is the plentiful interior lighting from the map lights to the lift gate lights and the dual overhead dome lights.

I have only two complaints thus far. The first is that it didn't come with an ashtray.  No big deal to most buyers but it is for me.  Saturn threw one in that fits in the way-to-low cup holders. I solved that problem by purchasing a cup holder that hangs from the door.  The little ashtray is a perfect fit and out of the way.
 
The second is that I find the heavy contour of the front seat uncomfortable.  I'm 6ft and 200 lbs and there isn't much lateral support in that seat. While the back rest is fine, I feel as though I'm sitting in a bowl.  But there isn't may mini SUV's I've driven that are much better. A small seat cushion (to level it out) solved most of that problem.

I've had this vehicle for one month now and am very impressed with the gas mileage (26 mpg) 1 mile over the sticker statement. 

Since we live in Oregon I purchased the AWD version to have something reliable to drive in the occasional snow we get here.  I opted for the economy of this mini AWD automatic vs the gas guzzling full size 4WD SUV's and the somewhat smaller mini SUV's since I'd only be needing the feature perhaps one week out of the entire year.  This vehicle is certainly not meant to be driven in severe off-road environments.  If you want that buy a Jeep!  For driving on paved roads in the snow it's perfect.

I also like the roominess of the VUE in comparison to the RAV4 that I looked at first. That, and the V-6 engine is what prompted me in my choice between the two vehicles.

Another nice touch is the little cargo thingamabob that is under the rear deck on top of the spare tire.  There is room for four fairly good size bags of groceries, plus there are two cut-outs on either side of cargo container for milk cartons.  

Buying experience:  No high pressure tactics and above all NO HAGGLING! Very informed salespersons.  They did a walk around inspection of my trade (with me present at their insistence) and quoted me a price for my vehicle after consulting an on-line Kelly blue book quote.  I thought they were a bit low and suggested a few hundred dollars more (exactly what I expected to get for my trade).  There was no problem with that.  

I did purchase the environmental package plus the "free oil change" option, and the extended warranty at my wife's insistence.  That added about three K to the original purchase price.  

Problems:  Only two so far in that the remote transmitter unlocks only the driver's door leaving the others locked.  That and the remote mirror control fails to lower the mirrors.  All other positions work.  If these are the only "bugs" in this vehicle then I'm a happy camper.

Conclusion:  Everything I desired in a vehicle.  All wheel drive, roominess, quiteness of ride, responsive handling, and a great pleasure to drive.  Highly recommended.
