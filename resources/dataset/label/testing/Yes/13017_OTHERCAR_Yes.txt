            The following is a review of the Volvo S80 sedan for the model year 1999.  Well, maybe 2000 as well, not sure, as the cars I've dealt with were company transportation (have ridden in several in the past few months, so perhaps they are 2000s).

While I never got behind the wheel of one, I have spent at least 4 hours total in this car.  So I believe I can inform you about it sufficiently.

Style:  
Exterior:  Certainly classy, composed.  It looks a bit bland from the side views, and I *still* don't like the tail light design!  Nothing great about the nose either, but not bad.
Interior:  Very nice.  Excellent ergonomics, buttons, etc.  It is obvious they tried to copy BMW in the way the lines are curved around the dash across the entire front panel, including the center console, but hey, trust me, that is NOT a bad thing!  Works very well, regardless of originality (not a difficult thing for a Volvo to pull off eh?  At least, not in past years).  Very comforting colors (been in black, grey, and tan interior color combos), typical of a Scandinavian touch.  Not terribly sexy, mind you, but pleasantly inviting cuz at the very least, your eyes will be comforted (but not excited).  Overall, very nice textures everywhere.

Comfort:  This is the standout.  The seats are truly fabulous.  You can tell tons of time went into the seat design.  Very nice leather choice for the price.  More spacious that a BMW 5-series in the back, but about the same up front.  Never sat in one at night, but I'm sure the colors are easy on the eyes, but again, not too sensuous in any way.  Pretty quiet in cruise mode (but that annoying Volvo engine DRONE sound comes about under medium-hard acceleration.  Quoting the driver &quot;all volvos do that!&quot;).  To me it was as if something was wrong with the engine.  But the driver said they all do this, not just this particular car.

Amneties:  The sound system, while I never got to blast it, is of a very high quality.  There is the prominent center speaker at the top of the center dash.  I believe it's a 440W system?  Also available in the Volvo C70, this system has been rated as awesome.  Probably.  Although, to be honest I didn't remember an in-dash CD player in the car...probably an option...given today's competition.  Decent trunk size.  Safety is of course right up there in the top echelon, with the side airbags, WHIPlash system in the seats, etc., but I still am a believer that the German luxo cars are safer overall.  Oh!  Also you get a radiator that cleans your neighborhood air!  Kewl.  =)

Drive:  For a FWD car, very refined in the low to medium speed cornering department.  Very linear acceleration, and the brakes seem quite capable.  Judging from performance figures, the T_charged S80 T6 is probably pretty involving to accelerate with.  Nothing special though, I'm sure.  Not bad though, I say again.  I could tell however, that the engineers tuned the suspension is a decent amount of performance in mind.  Very compliant, controlled, but not a boat by any means.  You definitely feel that.  Then again, compared to the German competition, when pushed hard (well hey, you're pretty well-insulated from a crash in a VOLVO, right?!) I am sure the suspension won't be anywhere near as composed as offerings from the Germans.  It's just that simple.  But then again, I never witnessed it, or even been in the car anywhere over 85mph, but judging from the way the suspension was dealing with irregularities in the road, it was quite obvious, speaking from experience.

Overall, I'd say Volvo probably has a success on their hands, but only if the competition doesn't get too popular amongst the average luxury car buyer.  It offers nothing to stir the senses, except maybe the overpowering feeling of comfort in the car.  Actually, maybe that in itself, coupled with Volvo's safety reputation, will sway you in its favor.  See, a Caddy also offers a strong feeling of comfort, but not in the special Scandinavian way.<br><br>
