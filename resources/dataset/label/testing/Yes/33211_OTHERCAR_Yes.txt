            I always wanted to get a digi-cam and today I finally made that commitment. I bought the PHOTOSMART 945 with some HP PREMIUM PHOTO PAPER [Semi-glossy] and it r0x0rs dAr b0x0rs!!!!

It has good zoom and flash so you can take nice bright pictures in low light settings. I took several pictures and I've never seen pictures so sharp. I know some of you future digi-camera owners are researching what you should buy and would like me to justify why I say that. I'm not much of a writer [I know,why am I writing this then],but I will briefly expand on the subject matter. One of my outdoor pictures was done in the afternoon under my big lemon tree with me wearing black. I had shadows falling on me from the fence and the lighting on my picture still came out bright. I've also tried this camera with multiple colors in the scenery to see if I can stun it's auto-focus feature and this champ proved it's worth. The picture was of my couch with the coffee table in the front and more paintings/pictures in the background and a dog wearing a shirt. The colors of the picture were sharp with no bleeding and/or mixing of colors on any spot. The flash that comes with it is very strong for it's size and it's the reason why my pictures look good in low-light. 

The camera uses lithium batteries,but they are of normal size [double A] and I like that. I hate buying electronics with property batteries that are too expensive and/or hard to find in stores. It only takes four of them,too!!!

The camera [when used with the optional dock accessory] {not included} can deliver pictures to your computer at USB 2.0 speeds if your computer supports it. I personally bought a HP PSC 2410 the day before and it has a built in dazzle reader and I have to say this printer and camera make a great couple. I can print up to 4800 optimize dpi if I have the good hp photo paper and a number 58 hp photo ink cartridge. I've never knew you could get great pictures at home without a professional photo lab. Also,I use the software that came with the 2410,so I never installed the software for the camera,but from my understanding,it's the same as the latest HP scanners & printers. You can crop,rotate,increase the sharpness,remove red eye,join,stretch etc your photos. It's newb friendly and efficient. 

This camera can also record short movie clips,but I haven't tried and/or care 'bout doing that,so I don't have anything to say other than it's a cool little bonus.

The buttons on the camera are not too hard and/or soft. I can push on the zoom button and the responses times are fast. There is a small LCD screen on the camera to preview pictures,but I don't use it cause you can actually see it in the camera lens when you are done shooting the photo,but it's nice to know you can see it on a bigger screen without a computer. 

The accessories that came with the camera are:

1. SD 32 MB card
2. HP photosmart Camera Strap
3. Energizer Batts [four of them]
4. Small camera lens lasso

It was great of HP to include a 32mb card and batteries for you to enjoy the camera right away. However,the camera doesn't come with an AC plug adapter. I hope HP corrects this in the future,but it's not totally necessary if you have a battery recharger,but it's food for thought...


I'm writing this review based on my first day with the camera and I find no faults with the camera other than the lack of an AC plug. No,I don't work for HP,so I'm not biased. I'm only biased with good products. The camera is a pleasure and I hope you visit a electronics store to sample it. 


Highly recommended.
