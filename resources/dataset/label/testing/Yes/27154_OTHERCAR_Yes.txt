                  We bought our 98 Chevy Astro right after the birth of our youngest son (my second child, his third). Looks weren't as important to us as necessity was, if it was based on looks I would never had bought it.
      
      The Astro has one sliding door and two regular opening doors. Ours has electric windows and doors and a stereo with a tape deck. There are lots of cup holders and little storage compartments throughout the van. The one I like best is a drawer underneath the passenger seat. The back end has a door that lifts up to put small stuff or if you need the space for larger items, the bottom has doors that open. Both the middle and third seats are easy to remove for large pieces that need to be hauled. 

      We chose the Astro because it was broader than any of the other mini-vans we had seen. During frequent trips to New Jersey from Maryland the Astro comfortably fits two adults, two adolescents, two car seats, a pit bull and all of our luggage. The front has two buckets seats, and the middle and third seat  both hold three people. I can easily fit between both of my sons' carseats (which is saying a lot). The roominess can not be beat. 
      
      I am not crazy about the boxy shape of the Astro but the pros far out way the unattractiveness of this van. All in all I am more than happy with our purchase.

     We have had a few minor problems, e.g a blown fuse that does not allow us to open the trunk and the service engine light keeps coming on but nothing that has been any major need for repair.

    The only thing I don't like about the Astro is the styling, it is too boxy for my taste. Hey, we can't get it all, all of the time. If you are looking for a minivan I recommend buying an Astro. You'll get what you pay for.
