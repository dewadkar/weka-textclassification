            I have have always loved the appearance of the Mitsubishi Eclipse ever since it debuted in 1989.  It is a sporty yet practical car.  Always being reliable and fun, the car was a success from the beginning.  I have drive the 2nd generation (1995-1999) and I own a 3rd Generation (2000-?).  I must say that the difference is immeasurable.  At first glance the 3rd generation model is a bit eccentric and even I disliked it at first but once you get used to it it has great style and class to it.  Almost everything is improved for the new model.  The transmission no longer feels like it is made out of plastic and the new optional V6 is much smoother that the previously offered 4 cylinder turbo.  The only downfall to this is that the power is slightly down for the V6 from the 4 cylinder turbo.  The interior of the new model is lightyears ahead of the 2nd generation, much more appealing.  I have had this car for 4 months now and I have only the following complaints: once fog lights are turned on, if you turn off the headlights and turn them back off the foglights default back to off; the power drivers seat only controls the bottom part of the seat, the part where your back is does not move at all; if you do not opt for the GT with premium package you get a hard plasticky shifter; the leather is of cheap quality and there isn't much of it, the back seats are vinyl; stock tires are terrible; no autodown on passenger window; the parking brake lever is right next to your right leg and may rub you.  I absolutely love the car, the complaints I have are so minor.  The car runs like a dream.  It is quick and always gets plenty of looks.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a flashy, affordable sports car.    <br><br>
