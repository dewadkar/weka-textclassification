            Ok, first things first.
This car, is a giant pillow on an amazing German power plant. Speed is found ample with the feather light feel of the throttle: one stroke, and you're off. yes I did say stroke, the throttle has no weight, let your foot stay limp and your doing 120 in no time (I live in Canada so that's KM's). Aside from speed, you have pure luxury, in what used to be a sporty sedan aimed at seniors at high schools, this new model is nothing short of elegant. Although somewhat lacking in leg room (I'm 6'2&quot; and fitting my legs is not all that comfy) but I don't care. The rest of it makes me forget. Seat heaters come standard, and the standard stereo is very tight. 2 pairs of tweets, two front, two back, two speakers in front and two mid's in the back make for crisp sound quality. If you're looking for better sound, look into a specail edition Monsoon Stereo system for a bit more cash. Back to the interior, in leather or non, the furnishings are like that of a Beamer, and the instrumental lights of blue and red are just an accent not to be missed. The ride is the most comfortable I've ever experienced in my life, I could fall asleep driving while on riddlen. The passengers where all falling asleep as I sped around braking from 160 KM's to a soft momentous-less stop at a red light. I don't know what kind of amazing suspension the factory people used, but I'm loving it a lot. Over to spec's, the car's engine rests standard on a 4 cylinder, 2 litre, 115 hp engine. This doesn't sound very fast, but somehow is. I've driven the GLS and the acceleration seems no different than a turbo. This is the only part I don't understand is the speed you get from a V4, with only 115 HP. Other than that, this car is absolutely amazing. If you have the doe to shell out, go get one now, otherwise I think not doing so would be sacreligious in some way.<br><br>
