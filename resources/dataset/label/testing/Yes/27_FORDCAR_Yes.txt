            I purchased a Ford Taurus wagon last summer as I needed to replace one of my vehicles.  The Taurus was the first test drive I made and right off the bat I was impressed by the generous amount of cargo space and easy access through the dual mode rear entry gate. Being the owner of a S.U.V. as well I figured that the wagon would be my highway car and for errands and weekend chores I would use the Blazer.  The reality was that the convenience of the Taurus and the virtually identical cargo capacity made it my all round vehicle of choice.
I am very impressed with the power and smooth acceleration provided by its 24 valve dual overhead cam V6 engine. This provides ample power to get up to highway speeds when entering the freeway and plenty of get up and go to pass other cars safely and with confidence. So far the engine has proven extremely reliable and relatively economical to operate. My recommendation is to go for this larger more powerful engine if a lot of your driving is highway miles.
The wagon has all of the comfort features that I was looking for and a few innovations which make driving it a pleasure. Easy access controls, automatic climate control system, remote keypad entry and deluxe sound system to mention a few. 
My only concern with the vehicle is how it will handle the rough winters we experience with plenty of snowy and icy driving conditions. If it measures up to this test the Trusty Taurus will certainly be my car of choice and will have won a new customer for Ford Motor Company.<br><br>
