              Hello friends this is bcseagle once again, this time I am going to talk to you about my newest car it is a 2000 Chevy Camaro SS Z-28, it is a poor mans Corvette, I think.
  My car is black with t-tops, leather interior it has every option know to man, I love it, I have already took it to a local quarter mile drag strip and I ran 12.54 sec at 153.256 mph, it was a good run,I don't know what the manufacture ran in the 1/4 mile,but I had fun.\
   The way the car handles in everyday to day traffic, is ok for a sports car, it could be better, but it will do,it is not a luxury car, but it will do, I would not drive it to Cali.,( I live in GA)but i would tow it to a car show there.
  The downfalls of the car is the cruise control, it has been the same for 11 yrs. it is time for a change! The hump in the passenger side of the car is still there!! What were the engineers thinking? 
  But I love this car you have to appreciate a car of this much power, if not it will get away from you. But like my Father said, &quot; It is your money&quot;<br><br>
