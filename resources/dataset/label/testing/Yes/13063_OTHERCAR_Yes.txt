            I have a 1988 Trooper II and have never had problems with it.  Mileage is 197,000 and climbing.  Lots of room in the older models, and the upright windshield really gives you great visibility.  Most likely my next car will be a Trooper, too.  It rattles a little bit and I wouldn't call it the smoothest ride in the world, but it's a fun ride.  My friends have all called it the ultimate tailgating machine.  Parts can be a little expensive, as you'd expect from a foreign car, but service required has been relatively minor (changed starter, brakes, shocks...) and not worth worrying about.<br><br>
