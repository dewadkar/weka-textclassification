            To anyone who admires cars, the 2000 Lincoln LS really does give you the chills - for two reasons.  First, it's a beautifully clean and elegant looking automobile, wonderfully balanced in its stance and very pleasing from any angle, and equally elegant and well-designed on the inside.  Second, you get all that for an incredible price - much less than you'd pay for a comparable Benz or BMW that, quite frankly, just wouldn't be worth the extra money.  The LS is just as pretty and fast, and there isn't one on every corner.  In my mind it's certainly the nicest car the U.S. has put out in quite some time, with the possible exception of the latest Vette.

Of course, I'm a little biased because I own an LS, but I loved it even before I ever considered buying one.  Mine's a V6 in black with the sport package option, and even without the V8 it's quite fast and surprisingly peppy at low RPMs.  The SelectShift is a blast, too.  The interior is very clean and well designed, and doesn't look at all chintzy even though it's largely plastic (in fact, a coat or two of Armor-All gives it quite a nice, leathery feel).  The seats are extremely comfortable, and there's plenty of room to stretch out - even in the back seat, though it's no Town Car in that respect.  

Controls and gauges are all pretty straightforward and sensible, too.  There's not much to say about them other than that they aren't cumbersome and don't detract from the beauty of the dash.  Though the woodwork isn't real, it's a convincing fake and certainly gives the look and warmth of the real thing.

Audio is important to me, and although my LS houses the factory radio/ CD changer, it's pretty good in its own right.  It's a little muddy, largely because there are no tweeters at ear-level, and it's not quite as loud as I'd like, but it does have good low-end response and the ergonomics of the unit are good (all the buttons are basically as I'd want them).  Also the car is VERY quiet with the windows up and the sunroof closed, so that helps with the sound as well.

Of course, I think there's a car for every person, and some people won't like the LS like I do, but it's the first car I've ever owned that regularly inspires compliments and &quot;thumbs-up&quot;s from passers-by.  I love my LS and I'd buy it over a Bimmer any day.
