            I have always been a car person rather than a truck person.  I've always had a need for speed and enjoyed fixing up Imported cars.  I recently bought a used, 98' chevy silverado with a suspension lift and big off-road wheels.  I absolutely love it!  It drives a little tough due to the oversize tires, but its very burly.  Girls who drive large trucks are very attractive.  It gives a man a certain sense of desire.  I can't wait to take the truck on its first road trip.  I have always had a lowered car so going up to the mountains to snowboard wasn't always easy.  Now however, I have a truck that will plow through the mountains like nothing.  It's great also because it can tow up to 8,000 pounds.  I own a mobile detailing business and have to pull a trailer everywhere I go.  It is not a problem at all.  I highly recommend this truck to anyone in the market to buy.<br><br>
