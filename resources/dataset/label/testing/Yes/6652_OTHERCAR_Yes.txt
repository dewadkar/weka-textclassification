            The reason I was looking for the Jetta because of its promised driving experience and it lives up to its name. The engine is quiet that people have asked me if the car was on at all !!!! The mileage is useful but not the best. 22-25 miles for the gallon on highways. The interior is spacious for 4 mid-sized people, but the moment you have two or more 6 foot people, the space becomes cramped. I am six feet plus, but its never been a problem so far to drive it. 
The music system is good and the service quality has been very good far. I have already accumulated 15000 miles in 11 months and so far no problems except a couple of flats, which is not really a car problem. 
The best feature according to me is the smoothness of the engine. For a car is this price range, the car just zooms like a baby. Its the best driving experience I have ever had and it beats the cheap japanese imitations like honda, nissan and toyota hollow. It combines the utility of these cars with the superb driving experience of a BMW.
The safety features are very good too and makes me feel very safe in the car.
All in all an excellent car. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.
