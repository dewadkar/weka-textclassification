            Appearance:
The 1999 Prelude takes designing cues exactly opposite of the former model.  While the old model was very sportcar-style oriented, the new Prelude looks like a low slung sedan, with square features and simple lines.

Interior:
The Preludes interior has a very clean, if not sparse, look to it.  The model I've driven (which had a green exterior) came with a tan interior.  Unlike the previous model, the dash sits far away from both the passenger and the driver, giving plenty of legroom for even the tallest occupants (My dad is 6'4&quot; and he is just fine in it).  The back seat should be reserved for purses, cd cases, and circus midgets.  But a warning: the midget would complain.  There is NO rear passenger legroom.  I'm talkin' none.  If you had a size 1 foot you couldn't put your feet down in the back seat.  This car is strictly a 2-seater.  Other than that, car was very user friendly, except for the cd player, which I had to stretch a little to use.

Performance:
My first encounter with a VTEC engine came with this car.  The Prelude is very rev-happy and it needs to be in order to get all the power out of the car.  It has a 195 hp engine and doesn't seem to use much of it until about the 5500 rpm range.  The redline is at 7500 which takes some time getting use to because when the tach needle stretches up in the high 6's the engine is screaming, a little disconcerting at first, but you get use to it.  Expect mid-7 0-60 times with the automatic.  And even though the cops have nothing on me, it gets to 100 mph fast.  Brakes were excellent, much better than the previous model.  When pressure is put on the brake pedal you can feel the calipers clamp down.  The Prelude has abs.  Handling was great, if a little front heavy.  The car turns wherever it's pointed, right in tune with how it's steered.  The combination of the rev-happy engine and excellent handling make it very fun to drive on a curvy road.  One thing I didn't like was the tiptronic option in the Prelude.  It seems like a good idea at first and when I played around with it, initially I thought it was cool.  But it really has no real purpose.  And I kind of felt like an idiot fake shifting an automatic.  Minor point, but if you get this car you'll see what I mean.

Repair:
As a whole Honda's are really reliable (so the rumor goes) but we had to have the starter replaced after a few months of driving.  The car runs flawlessly now.
