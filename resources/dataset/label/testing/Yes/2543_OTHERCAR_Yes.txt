            We purchased the 99 Montana based on the following:
1) It is basically the Transport, with a better trim and option package
2) The Pontiac logo makes resale easier
3) The van has a 4 door and 8 seat optional configuration.

The 8 seat configuration is especially nice if you occasionally haul small to medium loads, and need to keep a few fixed seats.  The seats also slide and collapse to make a nice place to store the kids toys, or adjust for folks with longer leg room needs.

The two biggest problems with the vehicle are:
1) Is is really loud on the road.  Inside you would think you were driving a panel truck and,
2) The rear gate is a bear to close, you almost have to leave a door open to keep from blowing everyone's eardrums out inside, and it does take some strength to get it closed.

The best parts of the van (or SUV, snicker):
1) It is very roomy, nice leg room, and you don't need alot of automatic garbage to make the seats comfortable.
2) It handles very well, even in high winds, and slick roads.
3) The 8 seats and 4 doors are a big plus
4) You can't beat the basic price with the standard options package.
5) We got the single CD player, which can be nice on long trips.
6) It hauls every thing I need, plus my kids and wife.

I feel very comfortable with this vehicle, and think it may be a bonus to anyone who is tired of the SUV craze, but wants something that looks classic without breaking the bank.<br><br>
