            I'll make this short and sweet.  I've been driving my Odyssey LX for the past 6 months and 7500 miles, and waited to write this review:

Here is the GOOD: this is one big and powerful van.  You won't have any trouble fitting people and stuff in it.  Of course, the main attraction is the fold-down third row.  You will not be disappointed with this feature.  This magic seat has already saved me countless times - moving furniture, transporting purchases, luggage, baby items, etc...  This van is very smooth and maneuverable for a big minivan. 

The BAD:  Be CAREFUL closing the sliding doors (on LX with manual doors) and trunk.  Several times I did not slam it hard enough so it was ajar.  The problem is that when you don't notice and leave it overnight, you WILL wake up to a dead battery and have to call someone to jump it.  The problem is that there are so many lights in the cabin that the battery will drain out in a few hours if the doors are not shut tight.  Another problem I notice is when going down a hill, it sometimes downshifts unexpectedly and you'll wonder if you hit a bump.  Finally, the transmission gear blocks the stereo controls.

The UGLY:  My only gripe is that I don't think it looks as attractive as the Ford Winstar. The Odyssey kind of has a boxy and stubby look.

CONCLUSION:  I think this is the best minivan on the market.  Believe me, the magic fold-down seat is worth it alone.  Ample size, power, and comfort.  Add the Honda reliability and reputation and you have a winner.  If you are looking for a minivan, this should be on your short list.
