            I purchased this car in March after an extensive search.  I test drove the Honda Accord, Chevy Malibu, Saturn LS, and Nissan Maxima.  I really feel for the money this car had the most to offer.  I have the LXI model and it comes loaded.  The only options available are moonroof and CD.  I got it all.  The sticker was just under 22k and I got the car for just under 19k.  I couldn't touch the other cars tested for that.  The Cirrus drives great has plenty of pep for me and I love the way it looks.  The only changes I would make are moving the drink holders ( they kinda sit under the console making it a little hard to get in and out).  I would also make the fuel door lock with a interior remote and change the keyless entry to include a remote trunk release.  

I love my car and fully recommend it to anyone.  It is affordable luxury.<br><br>
