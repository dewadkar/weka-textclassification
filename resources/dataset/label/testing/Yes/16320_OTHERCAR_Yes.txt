            My Husband and I received this camera for a Christmas present from my husband's mother. We were having a hard time deciding what digital camera we wanted to get. Luckily in the end the decision was made for us. This camera is great it is easy to use, takes great quality pictures and came with software, a power adapter, and a cable to upload the pictures to the computer.

The flash card that cam with our camera hold a maximum of 40 pictures. You have the option to purchase other flash cards that will also work with this camera. One of which holds 80 photos and 1 that can hold up to 120. There are also 3 different settings you can choose from when taking pictures. 

The only problem I have found with this camera is it goes through batteries very quickly. It uses 4 double A batteries and they are drained in no time. Other that that this camera has been wonderful<br><br>
