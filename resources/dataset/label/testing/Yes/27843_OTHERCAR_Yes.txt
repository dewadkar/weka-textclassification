            When I went car shopping about a year ago.I was kind of shocked to see the limited range of cars that were in my price range.  I looked at several options.  There were the tired and worn Honda Civics, Accords, and Toyota Camry's of the world, and the bottom line is...I wanted something a bit different, after all, why does everyone with $10 grand to spend on a use car HAVE to buy a Honda.  So I took a look at the Mitsubishi.  In it's price range the car looks very good.  Small enough to get in and out of traffic and get into those tight NYC parking spaces, and yet big enough to fit 4 comfortably, try doing that in a civic.

After test-driving my #1 reason for buying the Galant was comfort.  I am 6'2", 205 pounds, I need a car that isn't going to squeeze me in and make me feel boxed.  The Galant was a nice fit.  It gave me plenty of butt room and enough space to rest my arms on either the door panel to my left or the storage compartment to my right.  The radio and air gadgetry were all within confortable distance and could be reached without having to bend my arm.  Believe it or not it wasn't until weeks later till I actually sat in the back seats while someone else drove.  The roominess back there compared to just about any other car in it's price range is outstanding.  Remember, when purchasing a Galant, you're not buying a Lexus or Mercedes...don't expect it to same the same amount of space and comfort.  Compared to the Honda and Civic, the Galant is far far superior in comfort and room, believe me, I've owned all three.  The trunk space was also very adequate and I've taken long trips with 3 others and our bags fit in just fine.  The car is easy enough to keep clean, there are no hard to reach areas or tricky interior spots.  The Galant also comes loaded compared to the Volkswagon.  For the same price, few Volkswagons even come with power anything and the 97 Volks Golf looks barren and empty with very few features.

The Galant, like any car does have its drawbacks.  Many complain of the unreliability and consistent repair needed.  I've always been the type to treat my cars like babies and I've come to the conclusion that the better you take care of your car the better it will take care of you.  That being said, The Galant hasn't given me any problems any other car wouldn't give me given the amount I put into it.  Aside from the yearly tune-ups and tweaks, I had only one problem with the Galant and that was the engine mount and R&P steering.  The cost to me was $0 because of warranty and I got the car back in 2 days.  While I wouldn't rate the Galant as high as the Honda's in reliability, the service I recieved was excellent, and as long as you keep your car under warranty and take good care of it, no problem is ever that big.  For all I know the guy who had the car before me, probably abused it, considering it was a leased vehicle.  
The other piece I am uninspired about is the braking.  My brakes squeak very often, and I change brakes myself and have been for years, they never squeak.  They also don't give me enough braking power, especially when the car is in overdrive.  When I first got the car I had a few close calls because my brakes just didn't respond with enough intensity that i was used to in the Honda's and even some of the Nissan's I've driven.  I mean, we could be talking about a nanosecond of a difference, but if i can notice, i'm sure you can.
The only other drawback I have is that the car does not come standard with a sunroof.  This is such an outdoor car, perfect for summer and spring time long drives...what are those drives without a sunroof?  Of course if you really want one, they are available, but I didn't have much choice with mine.
I believe the car does come standard with two airbags, and the safety features have never been questioned so far as I know.

I paid $9,000 for my 97 Galant last year with 36K.  With warranty and other fees I paid just over $11,000.  Was it worth it...so far so good, the car gets me where I want to go, It feels good under my direction and it looks sharp.  Overall, I'd recommend it.
