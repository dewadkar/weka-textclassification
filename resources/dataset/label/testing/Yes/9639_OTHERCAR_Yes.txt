            My girlfriend was starting a new job after graduate school this year and we decided to get a second car for her to use when we weren't car pooling in mine.  We were looking for something to put a few thousand kilometers per year on and thus didn't want a big outlay of cash. When we started looking around at the dealerships we realized immediately that there were hundreds of used Neons available.  From discussions with some of the dealers we found out that the next used car auction was coming up and there were likely to be a whole batch on new Neons coming in.  Now my mother has had her 94 Neon Sedan since it was new and although she drives it very little, it has apparently been kept in mint condition.  I'd driven it myself enough to know that it had more power than I expected and it was a nice handling car on the road.  So we decided to wait a few days for the auction to take place and revisit some of the car lots.  

We found a '97 Coupe with 31,000 kilometers on it for a decent price (I think it was 8995.00 and we talked him down to $8300.00 CDN).  It was very clean looking inside and out as it had very little mileage on it.  We bought an extended warranty as is our practice on late model cars and took it home.  

This is a sporty looking car and the back is just slightly raised to give it just a slight bit of a hot rod look which I like and of course my girlfriend just complains that it makes the trunk harder to see over when backing up which is true.  The only real problem so far with this car has been the squeaky brakes.  The pads are new and yet the breaks squeak.  This sounds more like the squeak from sitting in one place too long, than a worn pad squeal, and that's what we originally attributed it to, but even after driving in downtown traffic, it will still squeak to a stop when you get home.  

Other than that we've had no problems with the car (although we've had it only a couple of months).  This will be it's first Canadian winter and we'll just have to cross our fingers.   I've read all kinds of complaints from others about trunk leakage and brake and steering problems, and can say that we haven't had any of those yet despite plenty of bad weather in the form of rain lately.  There is some air whistle when it drives on the highway.

The bottom line is that this is a very inexpensive car, new or used, and with an average priced car costing twice as much, we aren't expecting it to be built in any way other than fairly cheaply.  I am hoping that the extended warranty will cover any problems which may arise in the future, but for now we use this car so little that it hasn't really had a chance to give us any trouble.  

It's a very comfortable and easy car to drive in the city and on the highway with decent gas mileage.  I drive this car every couple of weeks and I find it very responsive and a pleasurable experience to drive.  There is plenty of head and leg room.  Thus I have no reason to detract from anyone looking at buying one of these.  Anyone looking in the Neon price range should already be aware that they aren't going to get Honda or Toyota quality, but should also expect better quality than a Ford Escort or a Pontiac Firefly.
