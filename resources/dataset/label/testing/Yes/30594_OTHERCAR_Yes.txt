            I bought a 1995 Kia EX, 4X4, Manual Transmission, in Dec 1999.  It has some problems, the dash board lights are out, but other than that, I am happy with it.  So much so that I purchased the KIA tow package (170.00) and had it installed totaling $375.00 and now can tow my trailer (1,000 lbs) and ATV's (1,000 lbs) anywhere my heart desires. (I went to Lake Tahoe with my kids for a week from Utah) The 4 cylinder engine is its only down fall.  I need that extra pick up when traveling long distances.  My brother and his wife own a 1998 KIA Sportage, 4X4, and it had a lot better pick up than mine does.  I love the roominess and my spare tire is outside so cargo inside or on top is great.  I live in Utah and the state with the &quot;greatest snow on earth&quot; has been great with that four-wheel drive.  I have only gotten stuck once in the mud in a lake bed near Delta, but that was my fault, too wet and too sticky mud for this SUV or any truck.  

I bought it for 9,000.00 and for this used SUV that here is a bargain.  Anyone and everyone should have this vehicle, because once you drive one or ride in one you gotta have it too, that is why I bought mine.  My older brother bought one and I loved it so much I bought one 6 months later. 
They say good things come in small packages, &quot;this is a good thing.&quot;<br><br>
