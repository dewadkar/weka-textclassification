            	With the same chassis and engine as the Dodge Dakota, the Durango is very very similar. The differences are, of course, that the Dakota is a pickup and the Durango an SUV, and a very good one at that. While certainly not in the same league as Hummers or Land Rovers, the Durango performs very well off the road and is easy and fun to drive on the road.
	Dodge trucks are the best you can buy. Period. With the Durango, Dodge has now proved that it can compete very highly in the SUV market, also, producing a very good vehicle at a very reasonable price. After having driven the Durango and Jeep Cherokee, for example, I would go with the Durango any day. Reliable and safe, the Durango is also roomier, with more passenger and cargo space, and is very comfortable to drive. Since it has the same engine as the Dakota (with Sport and R/T options available), the Durango is no slouch, either. It will beat a Grand Cherokee off the line, and seems more stable on corners. With the 4-wheel-drive option, you will feel stuck to the road in any and all conditions, and the Durango certainly outperforms the Jeep &quot;Yuppiemobile&quot; offroad (which is handy if you have interests such as hiking, climbing, or skiing).
	Although compared to a car you don't get the best mileage out of a Durango, the engine does not demand the expensive 92-octane fuel, and actually dislikes it. The Durango is extremely affordable for what you get, and not expensive to run. With plenty of passenger and cargo space it is perfect for hauling, road trips, or just cruising around with friends listening to a huge custom stereo system. Happy climbing up a rocky mountain or being valet-parked at a classy nightclub, the Durango is a true SUV, appropriate for all situations.<br><br>
