            We bought our Saturn back in Nov. of 1995 it was the 1996 model.
We have had it for over 4 years to date. It has never been in the shop for anything other than a oil change and new tires. It is a nice compact size car, big enough for a family of four.It is not the best ride if you are driving more than 6-7 hours at a time. 
It is great on gas though. All in all it is a nice compact family car and I would buy another Saturn in a heartbeat..Our salesman that did all the paper work still sends us Birthday cards and Christmas cards to this date. I can see him in the store and he knows our family by name. So I feel that the Saturn employees go beyond just being a salesperson.We have lots of friends that have went and bought Saturn's too after seeing how well they and knowing that they are affordable to just about everyone.So for the price that you pay for a Saturn you are truly getting a great Deal. I'm sure as with any car maker you will come across that one Saturn that causes someone nothing but Trouble. In my cause we find the best little car in town. I feel safe driving in it. I feel even better knowing that my daughter is safe in it too know since she is old enough to drive herself....<br><br>
