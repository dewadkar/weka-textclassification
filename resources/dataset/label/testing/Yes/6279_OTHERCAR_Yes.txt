            1995 Galant

Let me preface this review by saying that I'm originally from Europe. Where I'm from 1.6 liter engines are considered adequate, 2.0 liter engines excessive, and 2.4 liter engines extravagant. Also, the average car is about one size smaller than in the US. This, of course, is the result of the heavy tax-burden on gasoline. Yet another reason I'm glad to be in the US. However, this might skew my opinions in comparison to American-born reviewers.  

I have always enjoyed driving Japanese cars. My parents had two Toyota Camry's (actually called Corolla's where I'm from), and I took my driving lessons (required) in a two-door Nissan. As a result, when the time came for me to buy my first car I investigated the market, focusing on Japanese manufacturers. The way I see it, second-hand Toyota, Honda and Nissan are all overpriced. Mitsubishi is the only one that depreciates considerably as soon as the new car is driven off the dealer&#146s lot, which is what you want when buying a second hand car. I wanted a 4-door car, because of the added functionality, which meant the Mitsubishi Galant. 

I finally bought a 1995 Galant from a private individual with 98,000 miles on the odometer. It had been a lease-vehicle for part of its life (thank you, carfax.com), so I knew that it had been well cared for in infancy. It had been dealer-maintained after that. I paid under Kelly Blue Book value for it, because it has a small dent in its side. I have since added another 22,000 miles, and had remarkably little trouble. Before I bought it, the clutch had been rebuilt, and the cassette deck in the factory radio had quit working. 

Experience
The engine has more than enough pick-up for my taste, but fuel economy is not very good (20-25 mpg). The car rides like a much more expensive car. Cornering is a lot of fun. For me, the electric windows and cruise control were exciting luxury items. Leg space for the passengers and trunk space are all good enough.

Drawbacks
Numerous small things have gone wrong since I bought it: the cruise control quit working, the switch in the driver-side door stopped working properly, the windshield sprayer nozzles clogged up, and the trunk spring is now pushing the lid shut instead of holding it open. Also, I need to add oil after every 1500 miles. 

This may seem like a lot of defects, but keep in mind that this car has over 120,000 miles on it. Any car this age will have issues. I&#146m just glad it still keeps running, and may it long continue to do so. The only inherent defect is that the turning circle is about 1.5 times what it should be. 

Overall
My next car will be a newer model Galant. I guess a car can&#146t do much better than that.
