            Could it be a surprise to find today a car that can be quiet, comfortable, safe, peppy, and populary equipped in a reasonable price range now days?  Not often.  Most commercials we see would package that deal for $25,000 or more.  I've found that the Plymouth Breeze doesn't fall under that catagory of you have to pay half or more of your income on a good car.  I own a 1998 Plymouth Breeze with air conditioning, stereo, cruise control, and an automatic.  I got the regular engine for the car.  With 39,000 miles racked up on the gauge, the car has never given me a problem.  I've made frequent road trips and can get about 360+ highway miles on a full tank (driving very quickly though I might add).  I drive the car in the city but have several long distance road trips in it. Some things I would like to point out that I really notice are how little you can hear those annoying tractor-trailer trucks that drive down the highway; I mean when you get passed those big guys, you can't hardly hear their loud engines, the car is very quiet.  Even when I listen to the stereo loudly, the stock factory speakers never give me a problem; in fact, they sound exceptionally good for factory.  The only thing I don't like about the factory stereo itself, is that it has a little bit of trouble finding stations when you press the &quot;seek&quot; button.  I've often had to rely on the manual tuning of the stereo.  Cruise control is very nice on the car; it can sometimes be a little difficult to calibrate when in a hilly area and I often find it easier to just work it manually.  But this may be due to the engine.  One has to keep in mind that this car wasn't built for its power; it isn't a muscle car, it's a mid-size sedan.  The 4-cylinder engine has plenty enough power to accelerate past a slow moving car on a two lane highway, but this may be due to the gearing, not the &quot;raw&quot; power.  In all fairness though, I've taken the car to 110mph without hardly trying, in fact without hardly noticing because the car is so quiet.  The automatic is nice, but for me it has a habit of searching for the right gear.  I like to get a little pick up out of the car, so I often press the pedal a little hard.  Safety becomes a big factor when driving on todays roads.  I have to say I've had to avoid a lot of accidents on the highways today, and its setteling to know that the car has very good brakes, and the steering responds well in emergency situations.  The car has dual airbags, and side impact beams.  I would rate it as a very safe car; safe for the driver and the family. 
      
     Interior space is a big issue with cars these days.  Americans are bigger people than foreigners.  Unlike asian built cars, the Breeze is very roomy.  I can fit four six-foot plus adults in the back seats of the car without having to move my seat forward, and I got long legs.  The elbow room is nice too, you aren't crowded to the person next to you.  I havn't tried to fit a fifth person in the car, but I don't think it would be extremely uncomfortable for him; at the same time, I wouln't want to try it.  The arm rest in the car for the driver and passenger is nice,  it also has room inside for stuff.  
    The interior of the car is sculpted for the American.  We come in many shapes and sizes; there is no specific American size to build a car around, so it has to be universal in this aspect. The cars interior uses the best of the new found &quot;ergonomic technology.&quot;  Interior molding in the car, this happens to be a big peeve with me.  The way the car is molded inside.  By that I mean what materials the manufacturer chose, what they made them resemble, how they has them fit together.  I have to say, I'm very impressed with Plymouth on this.  Unlike some other major car manufactures who would take a nice looking style of cloth material, and then glue it to the doors.  I think GM has a horrible reputation for doing this.  The thing is, the car looks good when you buy it, but two or three years down the road, you have stuff pealing away.  Like the headliner, the door panels, or the flimsy plastic that is used, it just gets broken under normal wear and tear.  Especially the vinyl stuff used on dashes, it gets broken under sunlight.  Ford had a problem with that in earlier cars, but have fixed that problem.  Now Ford and Plymouth and a lot of Asian car manufacturers are using a foam type element.  Which absorbs the sound, doesn't fade, doesn't crack, and doesn't peal away.  The trunk space in the car is very nice too, very spacious.  

Exterior styling of the car is modest.  But I'm personally able to put up with that because of the cars many other talents that I've described.  

So we've covered driving styles, sound system, safety, and interior design, and styling.  Personally, I love the car, and I wouldn't trade it for anything but a Caddilac.<br><br>
