                 I bought my 1998 Dodge Stratus ES in 1999, it had 17k miles on it and still looked brand new.  I had previously owned a 66' Mustang, and it was my everyday driver for high school.  I was fixing to move to Orlando and start college so i needed something more dependable to transport around in all of the hectic traffic, toll roads, and mainly I-4!  I was looking for something with great performance, ample room, and good looks, and that's exactly what my Stratus delivers.  I am very happy with the car, especially it's handling and performance.  It has a sweet sounding, 2.5 liter, 24 valve 6 cylinder that produces 168 horse power that is quick enough to take most rice burners from any speed.  It revs up to 6500 rpms which adds somewhat to the cars acceleration.  This is also partially due to the autostick which allows for the driver to clutchlessly, manually control when to change gears (this is a fun option).  I also love it's awesome passing gear, especially when merging onto major roads which is a daily occurrence for me.  It handles great and sticks to the road like a magnet (due to front wheel drive and it's weight).  I've only had it sideways once and it was very difficult to purposely do so.  It seems to stop on a dime.  For all of the stop and go city driving I do, the car manages to still get good gas mileage.  With dark green metallic paint, 15" alloy wheels, low fog lamps, and tinted windows, this Stratus is aerodynamically sharp - i love the looks of it's curves.  The car has very comfortable leather seats in front and rear with ample room.  I have made a few 3 hr trips and the whole time the car was comfy.  It has a AM/FM stereo/tape player and a 6-disc cd-changer conveniently mounted under the dash which powers 6 speakers which are amazingly satisfactory.  The gauges are easy to read and well illuminated.  The cruise control is effortless to use and is conveniently place on the steering wheel.  The only complaint i have is the brake pad eating calipers on this vehicle.  It seems it likes to make the pads squeal all to often and reduces life time break pads to live only approximately 20,000 miles.  Another minor complaint is the cup holders for the front passenger and driver: it is partially under neath the radio and air conditioning controls so tall cups are a pain to get in and out; the front cup holders are also not very wide, canned drinks fit perfectly in them.  OVERALL: this car is great!
