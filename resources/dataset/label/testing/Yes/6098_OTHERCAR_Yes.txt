            <b>Summary:</b>
Rock solid. Lively motor. Gargantuan trunk. Deft. Adept. Have a nap while you're cruising across the prairies and save money on motels.

<b>Scope of review</b>

I did not buy this vehicle.  We rented this car and drove this vehicle across part of Canada and most of the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. 

A last minute change in our vacation plans meant that we had to drive 
8 hours south of Manhattan.  This was the day after driving 8 hours to <b>get</b> to Manhattan.  So we spent a lot of time in the car. 

The Impala made both drives very comfortable.  The seats wrap you in their embrace, but don't feel clingy.  The sightlines, mirrors, driving position all seem ergonomically researched to keep you alert but not wear you out.  After both drives, we alit, a bit tired, but not snarly.  Getting out of New York, and competing with 7 states worth of drivers was easy.  Leaving the coccoon of the cockpit of the Impala made me realize how coddled we were inside the car.  It felt like we were driving a far more luxurious car.  

<b>Power:</b>

The engine, a 3.4 litre 6 cylinder, has power to spare, and at cruising speeds of 80 mph on your fine interstate highways, hummed along at 2500 rpm or so.  Gas mileage was superb, and the automatic made barely perceptible shifts when merging or kicking down to pass someone doing a mere 78 mph.  

<b>Creature comforts:</b>

The controls are within easy reach, and intuitive (important on a rental car).  The heater worked, (in Canada) and so did the air conditioner (in Virginia).  The wipers worked, and only the odd way the wipers duck down beneath the trailing edge of the hood drew attention to itself.  The instrument cluster is well-lit, and all buttons for raising and lowering windows are in familiar places.

<b>The seats</b>

Oh, are you in for a treat.  They are comfy.  Back seat room is spacious, and the rear window doesn't intrude and try to occupy the same space as your head if you're a six footer.  Four adults would be comfortable.  And who would want to travel with more than four people anyway?

<b>The trunk:</b>

HUGE.  This is the first car where we've been able to put all our Samsonite hard sided luggage in the trunk, without having to cram the makeup case behind the front seat.  We also had room for lots of miscellaneous travel items, computers, and boxes of notes.  The liftover for loading is not unnaturally low or high.  

<b>The styling:</b>

I have several friends who do not like the styling of the Impala.  I love it.  The headlights are distinctive, the taillights distinctive.  The wheels look aggressive; maybe a little out of place, but I liked them.  The squarish sides of the car made it look a little bit more European, in my view.  

<b>Would I buy this car?</b>

Yes.  The price is very reasonable, for what you get in a base edition.  GM cars have very reliable transmissions and engines (especially one as lightly stressed as this one) and give good service for a long time (look at all the GM limos out there).  I don't know of any recalls for this model.

<b>To drive this vehicle:</b>

This car is the perfect King of interstate cruisers, a position previously held by the Buick Roadmaster station wagon with the Vista Dome.  The wide tires, forgiving suspension, power on tap, good visibility and comfortable surroundings make this a perfect long distance car.  Take it everywhere.  It might be a bit large for everyday driving in the close confines of the city, but it would not look out of place at the country club, or being valet parked at a restaurant.  A tall order for such a reasonably priced car.  

<b>Who should buy this vehicle:</b>

 - Salespeople with large sample cases.
 - Real Estate agents who have to squire customers about in comfortable seats, and who want the comfort of 4 doors.
 - Middle aged or older folks who still want to blow the doors off some Johnny come lately in a hopped up Accord.  
 - The 34 year old family man, with 2 kids and a lot of baseball equipment to take to the field.
