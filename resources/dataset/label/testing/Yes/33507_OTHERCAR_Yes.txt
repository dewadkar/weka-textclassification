            The Fuji FinePix A205 gives you a 2-megapixel digital camera with ability to take movies. The A205 comes with a 16MB <a href="/content_94351232644">xD-Picture Card</a>, two AA Alkaline batteries power it and they have an optional CP-FXA10 cradle that comes with a set of rechargeable batteries. I do recommend so rechargeable batteries. 

The camera measures 3.9 inches wide x 2.6 inches high x 2.1 inches thick, and weighs a little over 8 ounces with the batteries. The retail price is $199.

This is an entry-level camera that is basically a point & shoot camera. The only manual settings are for White Balance and Exposure Compensation. 

<b>Movies</b>
The movies come in 10 frames per second in the AVI mode with two sizes of 320 x 240 pixels and 160 x 120 pixels. The 320 x 240 pixels can record up to 20 seconds and the 160 x 120 pixels can record up to 180 seconds. The down side to the movies is there is no sound. The movies can be played back on the LCD screen, a computer or even a TV through the video out on the camera. 

<b>Photos</b>
The photos can be taken in three different sizes of 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960 and 640 x 480. 

The 1600 x 1200 is in the 2-megapixel mode which is great for 5 x 7 inch photo prints but I think is also dose a fine job on 8 x 10 inch photo prints. 

The 1280 x 960 is a 1-megapixel setting that is good up to about a 5 x 7 inch print, at an 8 x 10 inch print it shows a lot of grain in the photo. 

The 640 x 480 is the VGA mode and is all right as long as you are not planning on printing any photos larger than a 4 x 6 inch photo print. 

<b>The Lens</b>
The lens has an optical 3x zoom that is equivalent to a 35mm camera of 36mm-108mm. It has a digital zoom of 2.5x in the 640 x 480 mode.  

Focus range is 2.6 feet to infinity in the normal mode and 0.3 feet to 3.3 feet in the Macro mode. Aperture range is f3.0 - f7.0 in the wide-angle and f4.8 - f10.9 in the telephoto range. 

Shutter speed is 1/2 of a second to 1/2000 of a second.

The zoom moves in steps, which is not as smooth as most digital cameras.

<b>The View</b>
The Fuji FinePix A205 gives you a real-image optical viewfinder and a 1.5-inch amorphous silicon TFT LCD with 60,000 pixels. 

The viewfinder is great and will save you on battery power if you switch the LCD off.

The LCD is used for settings, viewing and movie and photo taking. You can view a single frame, 9 multi-frames and up to 13x playback zoom. The clarity of the LCD is excellent; the only problem I have with it is the small 1.5-inch screen size. 

<b>The Flash</b>
The A205 has a built-in flash in the top center of the camera. I like this type of flash a lot better than the pop up flash type. 

The range for the flash is 2.6 inches to 11.5 feet in the wide-angle and 2.6 inches to 9.8 feet in the telephoto range. 

The modes are: Auto, Forced Flash, Suppressed Flash, Slow Synchro, Red-eye Reduction and Red-eye Reduction   Slow Synchro.

<b>Other Features</b>
Sensitivity is equivalent to ISO 100
USB interface
Power-input socket
Shooting modes of Auto, Manual, Macro and Movie
Video Out is NTSC and PAL 
A self-timer of about 10 seconds

<b>Overall</b>
This is a great little camera at a nice price for the person needing basically only a point & shoot camera with good photo quality. It is a good-looking camera and very easy to use; I love the sliding cover over the lens verses a lens cap. This camera will not turn on by just sliding the cover over, you also have to slide on a power switch. 

When you turn it on, to when it is ready to shoot, takes about 4 to 5 seconds. The shutter delay is less than one second and it takes roughly 3 to 4 seconds between shots. All this various also on the resolution you are using. 

For indoor shots it is best at closer ranges then distance shots. For outdoor use with sufficient lighting it will take any distance far or near. The color of the photos are richer and life like on the outdoor shots verses the indoor flash shots.

Printing an 8 x 10 in photo is no problem when using the 1600 x 1200 resolution, in the 1280 x 960 the quality dropped a bit. The 1280 x 960 produces nice 5 x 7 inch photo prints and I recommend the 640 x 480 only in the 4 x 6 inch prints.
