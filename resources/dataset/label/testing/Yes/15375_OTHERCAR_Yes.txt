            I received this camera for Christmas, and it has really changed my life! I am now able to take excellent quality photos and immediately e-mail them to friends and family who live far away. The camera comes with a thick carrying strap which keeps it safe, and is very portable. It is very easy to use, and to upload images to pc. I love some of the great features such as switching to black and white,solarized, or cyanatype style photos, and using the short video clips. We hiked a mountain on New Years day and recorded our resolutions on it! Every time I am out using this camera I am asked many questions about the camera,I have even gotten e-mails requesting it's name in order to purchase one. The offer it comes with allows a one year membership to Sony Imagestation where you have your own album page of 50 photos for one year. once uploaded, you can send cool postcards of your photos! I'm on there every day!<br><br>
