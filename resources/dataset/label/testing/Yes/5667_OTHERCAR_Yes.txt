            I always say I will write a review, but in the end never do. I must say though that in my search for a digital camera, the reviews were a serious factor in my decision.
If you are looking at the Canon S330, and have been doing research you know that this camera is an anomaly in terms of where it fits in.

IF it were 3mp or IF it were $80 less, you would jump at it. Right? IT seems to be a bit expensive for what it is, but it still attracts you.

I was in this boat, and in the end bought the S330 and I'm happy. (Of course I would have liked it cheaper, or with 3mp but I see the price has gone done in the last few weeks (since I bought it for $350 but got a CF with it)

Again if you are doing your research you are prob deciding between the S330 and the Coolpix2500. You prob know that Dimage X just does not have the Quality. And the S200 only has 2X zoom. 230 too

There are some really cheap 2mp cameras BUT many have fixed focus (or digital zoom) , or only 2X, some don&#146t have CF, other no movie mode or no sound etc &#133

Also note the size puts this guy into a small category and you pay for that too, for me it was and is important.

The definitive review of this product (including comparisons) is:

So here is my opinion, and my suggestion that this is a camera to be reckoned with.

Caveat &#150 yeah I played with the "serious" manual functions but 90% of my use is the automatic mode

First the bad.
1. In lower light situations, it sometime will NOT grab a focus and take a picture. It is annoying, I have lost some good pics cause of this. Lately, I have shut of the beam that is used for auto-focus. To me this is the biggest annoyance. I just hold the button down and nothing happens.
2. The Battery is proprietary and a replacement will cost at least $25. And for important events you want the security of the second battery.
3. The battery dies VERY soon after you get your first low battery warning (BTW it is worth it when you buy a second battery, to get the "extra power" one it lasts much longer)
4. no included AC (can&#146t charge battery inside camera either )
5. As stated price-mp ratio

Now the good.
1. I love it
2. It takes great "auto" pictures
3. It uses CF which is something I wanted
4. The movies are great even 10 seconds they are a lot of fun (and have sound)
5. The ability to do a slide show on a TV is great. Several times we all came home and immediately plugged in to the TV and got a show. I did not think I would care about this but it is very good for instant gratification.
6. Very cool &#150 Stitch mode to make panoramic pics.
7. Even the 2mp takes great pics. I have made 8*10 blow ups and look like they are film. I have cropped out to 1/3 the picture size and gotten fine 4*6 pictures
8. small and very solid look and feel.
9. you can zoom-in on pictures, on the LCD screen. This is great to play .. "whose ear is that?" a great party game I made up.
10. I like the screen
11. battery life

I did an interesting test with it. IT has 3 MP settings. 2, .9 and .5 (or that is how I guessed it) there is also 3 compression levels. So that gives you 9 types to take. I took the same very colorful picture outdoors 9 times and marked the settings. I think had them printed out professionally on a Fuji Frontier
For 2mp. The compression does not Matter and the file size can change by a factor of 3. I must say I even felt that for at 4*6 you could not tell the diff between 2mp and .8. All in all great quality. 

It will cost you are least $25 but you WANT a second battery. When I sue the camera I always carry a spare battery and CF.

I love the switch to digital, I take a lot more pictures, but print less. 

To me the 3X zoom was a must &#150 so it knocked out the s200 I see there is an s230 which is interesting and you get 3mp but NOT 3X zoom. 

I guess the question is can you wait for a 3x optical zoom (you all know that digital zoom is a fake right?) and 3mp from canon to come out? if it is scheduled, although I must say I have not missed the 3rd MP. 

Hope this helps and enjoy
