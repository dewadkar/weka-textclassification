            The 1999 Jeep Cherokee is a great bargain.  Right now is an even better time to buy.  A makeover of the model is due in about a year, and there are great deals out there for a 99/00 model.  The SUV is a trusted vehicle that has proven itself over the years.  It has a powerful 190 hp engine that is more than adequate for any type of driving.  It's 4 wheel drive system is easy to use and is perfect for snowy roads.  It is a bit noisy and rough, but that can be expected from most SUV's.  There is adequate space in the back seat, and plenty of storage as well.  It's a great inexpensive vehicle for someone who wants a SUV but can't afford the higher price ones.  IT'S A DEAL!<br><br>
