            What a truck.  The Ford F350 Crew Cab pickup is one of the best looking trucks out on the market today.  A few days ago an inlaw of mine bought one, and I thought that it would be like any other 1 ton truck.  To my surprise it was the best ridding truck that I have ever driven, and rode in.  My family needed the Crew Cab to go racing, and this thing is everything that a racing family could ever dream of.  With the 7.3L Powerstroke Diesel under the hood the F350 can just about go anywhere and do just about anything that you would want it to do.  Lots of power and the suspension to carry anything you could imagine, but yet it rides like a Cadillac.  I would recommend this truck to any farmer, racer, or anybody with a large family that wants to tour the country alot.<br><br>
