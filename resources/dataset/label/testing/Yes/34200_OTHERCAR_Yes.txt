            I want to start off by saying that I am in no way a photography expert.  My motivation for buying a new camera was to photograph a new addition to our family.  In the past, I've relied on my trusty 35mm camera for our basic needs (vacations, family get togethers, etc...).  The problem with a 35mm camera is I have no way of telling if the "once in a lifetime picture" will turn out.  I also don't have the best track record for getting film developed in a timely matter.  What I really like about digital photography is that you know instantly if you "got" the picture, and you only develop the pictures you want.  OK, now on to my review of this camera.  

A choice of two:
It came down to two cameras for me, the SONY DSC-P9 and the CANON S40.  Both are 4 megapixedl cameras, and are similar in many respects.  The SONY had the following advantages.  It has 3 flash settings (low, med, & high). It also has a true 2:3 ratio, meaning you don't have to crop to make a 4" x 6" photo.  The CANON is slightly larger in physical size, and has a little more control over manual settings.  I however wouldn't really use those manual controls, so I went with the SONY.

This 4 megapixel camera takes incredible pictures.  It's almost overkill for normal 4 x 6 photos, but the greater resolution is alway welcome.  It also take close to film quality 8 x 10 photos as well.  As stated before, the 3 flash levels are a very useful feature and I was only able to find this on the SONY.  Once the picture is taken, you can play it back on the LCD screen.  On such a small screen though any picture looks good.  SONY has a zoom ability, so you can get up close on playback, up to 5x magnification.  This is great way to tell how focused the picture really is.  For filming it has MACRO mode (close-up), Twilight mode (night shooting), Landscape mode (shooting objects at a distance), and your standard AF mode (which you'll use most of the time).  You can set the camera to focus on multiple objects, or set it to spot mode (single object focus).  When shooting at night or in low light situations, you will still see a small degree of noise.

IMAGE SIZE:
2272x1704
2272 (3:2)
1600x1200
1280x 960
640x 480

The camera also has MPEG video mode.  Despite it's advances the video mode quality just isn't there yet for me to use this mode. Other features this camera has are: timer, 6x zoom, multi burst continuous shooting, white balance adjustment, AF illuminator (helps adjust focus in low light), & red-eye reduction.

Conclusion:
I'm really happy overall with this camera.  It will do everything I need it to do and more.  My only real concern isn't with the camera itself, but it's manufacturer SONY.  This product only comes with a 90-day warranty (shame on you SONY).  I also had a question about one of the features and contacted SONY.  You have to call, wait on the phone to get a rep who will transfer you to a technician and then wait longer.  I never did get to a technician.  The first time, I was on hold for 45 minutes (hung up out of frustration) and the second time it was close to an hour (I had to hang up to pick up my wife).  I guess customer service is not their number 1 priority.  Well enough of my rant...this is more camera than the average user will need (myself included).  


***Update***
If you purchased this camera, here's a little tip for you.  If you have the power save feature turned on, the default flash setting is always turned to off.  Turn the power save feature on to fix this.  Also in low light the "Steady shot" hands will flash until the flash has been turned on.  I hope this helps.
