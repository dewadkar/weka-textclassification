            This camera is great for the money.  I bought this last week and must have taken over 300 pictures.  I guess because this is my child's first Christmas.  Pictures are sharp.  The lens cover is a nice touch along with  the viewfinder (saves battery life) and the usb cable.
Setup wasn't too bad.  I kept getting error messages saying unable to read your drive (removable camera drive).  I went to Fujifilm.com faq site and was able to fix the problem. 
The only drawback that I have with this camera is the green light next to the viewfinder.  It gets a little annoying.  Other than that, it's a wonderful camera.  Loving every minute of it.
PS:  I also bought NIMH rechargeable batteries and a 32 mb smartdisk.
You will need these.  Trust me :)
