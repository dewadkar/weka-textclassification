            I bought my CR-V last July and it handles just as good as when I got it, because I live far from work I have 25,000 miles on it and it drive superbly.  I bought the CR-V because price plus options it was a better buy than it's major competitors.

There are Two models to choose from, EX and the LX, if you can spend the extra 1,000 dollars and get the EX.  You get the nicer wheels; door handles, CD player and the rear seat fold completely flat with the front seat making a bed (well sort of) probably good if you go camping.

With The CR-V you also get a fold out Picnic Table and a cooler/secret storage area (bed of the trunk), and just lots of places to put your stuff throughout the car.

I moved last August and with the exception of large furniture I moved boxes of stuff entertainment centers, I was shocked at the amount of stuff I was able to fit in the CR-V.  What the car can hold and what it looks like it can hold is deceiving.  You can hold sooo much more than you would expect, and have room to spare. Even fully loaded the CR-V handles extremely well.

Because it is built on a car body, those who want a car built for hauling or trucks with huge engines probably wouldn't like the CR-V. It's lightweight compared to a Jeep Cherokee or Even the Honda Passport, but it's ideal for families who don't want a minivan and need to cart the kids and everything else.  But the CR-V does accommodate those who want to sit up higher, this added to well designed widows equals superior visibility.

I have been very impressed with the Honda CR-V and if my next car isn't a CR-V it will be another Honda.
