            Almost perfect

I really wanted to buy a digital camera to capture memorable moments in my family.  I used to have a film camera, but the film became a hassle and the costs were adding up.  I researched on the internet for a perfect digital camera.  

Here's my list of my wants

1.  great picture
2.  not too expensive
3.  rechargeable battery
4.  not bulky
5.  easy to use
6.  fast download to computer.

After narrowing down my list I had two cameras.  One was the Canon Powershot A20 and the other was the Canon Powershot S10.   At first I was leaning towards the Canon Powershot A20 but it was a bit more expensive and after looking at Epinions I decided on the Canon Powershot S10.  

This camera is a bit old.  It was actually first introduced in `98.  At the time it was one of the smallest cameras in stores.   Obviously today it isn't, but that doesn't take away from it's wide range of options and picture taking abilities.  I read review after review on this camera.  I looked at examples of pictures taken by this camera and they were all decent. A few days later I ordered the camera off of a site for $312 dollars.  But I also had to buy accessories such as the battery recharger and ram, so it actually brought the price all the way up to almost 600 dollars.  I was slightly annoyed at having to buy 300 dollars worth of accessories but it was well worth it.

I got the camera in the mail a few days later and it was almost perfect.  Usually cameras are rectangular and thicker but this camera is thin and has no grip at all.  I'm not use to taking pictures like that but it's something I have to get use to.  I'm not very technical with cameras at all.  I'm a mother and I know nothing about using cameras before I started researching.  All I knew how to do was to push the button.  I really got interested in digital cameras and I learned a lot about them.  The book that came along with the camera was very helpful but I found the internet to be even more helpful.  So for all the people out there who are going to buy this camera look on the internet instead of reading that book.

There are 5 modes on this camera.  The first is Stitch Assist Mode, which means you can take pictures so you can stitch the pictures together so it looks like you are actually there.  The other modes are Image Mode,  Manual Mode.  These give you control of the flash, zoom, and contrasts.  Automatic Mode is for the beginner.    If you don't know very much about cameras, you can use automatic mode so the picture will still turn out great.  The last mode,  Playback Mode is where you can review the picture you took or even delete the picture you took.  These are just the basic functions of what the modes do but they can do much more, but I won't go into detail.

This camera is getting cheaper and cheaper the older it gets, yet it still is a functional camera.  For the amount of research and experience I have with my camera I would definitely recommend this to you.   Not only is it cheap it takes great pictures.  It was the best 3 years ago, and it is still one of the best now.  

*Update*  Just to let you know the cheapest price I found on the net was $310.
