            We bought our MPV 2 years ago, it is a 1994 model and we love it.  When we can afford a brand new one, we will definitely stick with the Mazda MPV.

Ours is a 4 wheel drive, completely loaded with tinted windows, cell phone , CD player, radio/cassette, power locks and windows, alarm system, cruise control, the list goes on.  Since it was a used van, we had a good deal when we purchased it.

The service with Mazda is exceptional.  The service people are very helpful and honest.  There is a good maintenance schedule that we follow to keep the van in good running condition.  We have not had much go wrong with our van even with it being 6 years old with 150,000 for mileage.  It is very reliable and fun to drive.  Before the MPV, we owned a Mazda 626, and before that a Mazda truck - B2200, all have been good vehicles.

It seats seven and for a family of four it is great if we need to take extra passengers or transport large items.

I highly recommend the Mazda MPV especially for families, even if it is an older model - they are very reliable, comfortable to ride in and sporty looking.<br><br>
