            the 70 and the 2000 Monte Carlo have some of the same things that make any muscle car mans mouth water. In seventy the monty was a sweet family/luxury car with the horsepower to tear up the pavement. The 200 follows in its footsteps. It has class and luxury sport written all over it. The horsepower it gives can easily turn the tires making it a great car for the strong hearted. The only problem I see with the car is the lack of rear wheel drive. The front wheel drive is good for winter driving but on sport cars the rear wheel posi traction is a must. This is the only fault I see in the engineering of this vehicle. I personally own a seventy and wouldn't trade it for the world. It has the power to smoke the tires and the sport to handle and comfort the most precious luggage( your body). 

The 200 has all the same including class and sleek lines that make these cars desirable to all that wont power combined with comfort. I the end if you want classic style and smooth driving, take it for a test drive and find out what your missing.<br><br>
