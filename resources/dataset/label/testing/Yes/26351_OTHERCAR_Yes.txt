            As an amateur photographer who prefers a manual focus SLR and prime lenses for control and picture quality, I wanted a  digital camera to take snapshots and as a "backup" camera for traveling pictures.  My search led to the Sony DSC-P71, a 3.2 megapixel camera with optional manual focus and digital settings that provide some decent options for picture-taking.  

To my surprise, the P71 is a great little picture taker that often rivals the best of my Nikon.  It has a very nice feature, an autofocus illuminator, that enables the camera to focus even in the dark as long as your subject is within about ten feet.  It also has very little "shutter  lag" allowing you to take pictures in normal conditions quickly one after another.  

It has a comprehensive and simple menu that is displayed at your option on the bright and colorful LCD screen.  And it allows you to format the pictures in the camera itself by zooming in and trimming as you like it; the only danger is that too much zooming will undermine the quality of your picture.  You can also set it to Landscape, Twilight or Twilight Portrait Mode.  The last mode takes excellent photos of people at night yet still shows the city light background.  

It also has a 3x optical zoom that is excellent, but I do not recommend using the additional 2x digital zoom.  Again, this will make your pictures too grainy.  Another nice feature, it really feels like a camera.  It's sturdy, the right size and has the LCD on the middle right where it should be.  This way your left thumb can rest where it belongs, on the left side of the camera.  Too many digitals have the LCD screens on the left where your thumb belongs!

The initial memory "stick" of 16 megabytes is inadequate.  I bought a 64 MG that holds 40 3 megapixel photos at one time.  The provided battery charger is slow; it takes at least ten hours to charge.  I bought a "one hour" charger that will recharge two backups in about 90 minutes.  With these optional purchases the P71 is a complete package.

The P71 is made for connectivity.  It has a USB port to a computer and a video out that allows you to put on a slide show directly from your camera; very nice.  And the memory stick can be plugged directly into most printers today.  It also has an adapter slot to connect to your wall to save batteries.

There are, of course, some negatives.  There is no external flash.  The internal flash is superior for a point and shoot camera, but a through the lens external flash would be better.  There is no sound even for the movie mode; so don't get it if you want this to be your video camera, also.  

The Pixel software for showing and adjusting your pictures is almost incomprehensible.  The Help brings up instructions but they are unclear and at times incomprehensible.  The adjustment features are rudimentary and the interface with Windows is terrible.  The one time I did call Pixela service for help I got a very nice live person almost immediately, but the software still stinks.  Thank goodness I already had Adobe Photoshop on my computer.

If you want a great digital camera that takes fantastic snapshots, that's compact and easy to use, then consider the 3.2 megapixel P71.  It's all you will ever need and it's very quick for a digital camera.  If you want movie sound, full manual controls, changeable lenses, external flash or to print out still shots larger than 8 x 10, consider a digital SLR or the Sony DSC 85.  For most amateurs this is all the digital camera you will ever need.
