            I bought my used 1998 323IS on eBay in May 2001 with about 45K miles.  I've bought three other cars on eBay, two 1993 300ZX and a 1996 Pathfinder and all experiences have been good.  

Before I bought mine, I had driven my friend's 1995 M3 and was extremely impressed with the car.  Since I couldn't quite afford an M3 I opted for a 323 or 325IS and was pleased with its performance.  

The performance of my 323IS is very good.  It's obviously not as fast as an M3 but it performs well, 0-60 in 7.1.  Another magazine has it timed at 0-60 in 6.7.  It is very "torquey" even at low RPMs.  Going through the Los Angeles Grapevine on I-5, I noticed I was in 5th gear pulling away from everyone at 1500 RPM going uphill.  The car is well balanced and even the car battery is located in the trunk.  

I added some nice BMW options such as the factory alarm, 6 Disc trunk mounted changer and factory 17" M3 Contour wheels.  Adding the wheels further improved handling and it handles almost as well as my older 300ZX.  Traction control is a definite plus, especially in the rain.

Some luxury and safety features are traction control, side air bags, auto power up AND down windows, auto power down sunroof, heated seats, onboard computer, anti-theft radio, and cruise.  

Anyone looking to purchase one I would suggest buying one with a warranty.  One month after I owned my 323IS, the driver side window motor went out and they replaced it at no cost.  That was the only repair.

I've own quite a few other cars, and this is my first Bimmer.  It's not quite as easy to drive as a Honda.  The clutch is heavier and the visibility isn't quite as good as a Honda but you can't beat BMW's quality, luxury and performance.  

I'm definitely getting another one soon...
