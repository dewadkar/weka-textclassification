            I have owned 17 vehicles.  My 1994 Mazda Protege is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  To this day, it gets 30 miles to the gallon.  I have had nothing but routine maintenance to do to it.  I have put nearly 130,000 miles, and never been left stranded.  This car was bought as a demo model off of the show room floor with 1,900 miles on it.  I paid less than half of what most people pay for their cars.  I have driven through most of the United States, and it has performed well in all driving terrains, including the snow and mountains of Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and Virginia.  It has endured the heat and humidity of the south in Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi.  It is roomy, comfortable, and spacious.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a cheap, affordable, no-maintenance vehicle.  <br><br>
