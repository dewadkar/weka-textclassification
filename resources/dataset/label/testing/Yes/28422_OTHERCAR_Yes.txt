            I bought this car new in January of 1997 when Kia had nowhere near the market presence that they do now, which isn't all that great even today.  Still, the Kia appealed to me because it was inexpensive yet offered the mechanical qualities and basic amenities that cost thousands more on other more recognized models.

To sum up its reliability in a word, the Sephia was excellent.  It required a non wear-and-tear repair only one time (a faulty EGR valve), and that was within the first six months of ownership.  Otherwise, with only routine maintenance, it ran and drove flawlessly.  It offered spritely performance thanks to its 122-HP Mazda-sourced engine and 4-speed electronically-controlled automatic, also a Mazda unit.  It handled well thanks to its larger-than-average 14-inch wheels and tires and Lotus-tuned suspension.  You read correctly...LOTUS.  Seems that a few years back Lotus sold its interest and development of the ill-fated Elan to Kia, who in turn dispersed some of its handling magic into its more pedestrian models.  As a result, though the Sephia rode stiffly, it provided a very intimate driving experience that likely none of its contemporaries at the time could deliver.

The Kia was not without some flaws.  The construction of the dashboard was very shabby.  The quality of the vinyl and the foam padding underneath it were low, as evidenced by its attempt to bail out of the car by peeling up from the base of the windshield.  This was fixed with an X-Acto knife and a custom-fit Dashmat (an excellent product, by the way).  Various lights in the dashboard worked intermittently, more worrisome those in the instrument cluster that might alert one to engine malfunctions.  The brakes are not terribly durable, though they are cheap to work on.  And the resale value on these cars are horrible, due mostly to lack of brand recognition and unproven reliability.

I changed the oil regularly in my Sephia, did routine maintenance as scheduled, and drove the car 170,000 miles with nary a breakdown.  In fact, I'd still be driving the car had my attention span been wider on a foggy day a few weeks back, when I rammed it into the back of a late-model Dodge Ram (how appropriate) pickup truck at a clip of around 30 MPH.  Of course, the Dodge emerged virtually unscathed, but thanks to its trailer hitch it destroyed the front of my Kia.  Both airbags deployed as it was a pretty violent collision.  Yet I was able to immediately exit the vehicle safely and with no injuries.

So in addition to being a durable car, the Kia proved to be a safe one, though I regret that I had to learn about this the hard way.  I can't really speak for the new Spectras (which are the current Sephia equivalent), but I do know they offer exceptional warranties and competitive prices.  If you're looking to buy a used Kia, I would urge would-be buyers to ensure that all prior scheduled maintenance has been performed.  Otherwise, it should be a safe purchase for somebody looking for inexpensive, reliable transportation.
