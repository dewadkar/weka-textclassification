            By my experience as an owner, this little car is getting worse reviews than it deserves. One negative reviewer, in fact, appears to be writing about a different car altogether--the Kia "Spehia."

There are some drawbacks to the Sephia. The plastic interior components do break--specifically, the latch on the center console didn't last long for us, and the dashboard has warped slightly in one spot. The speakers that Kia used in this car are total trash--they rattle like a snare drum. (They are easily replaced, though.)

The engine has a loud, choppy sound to it, but it's been that way since day one. It is a reliable engine and has a fairly low appetite for fuel (though mileage is not spectacular--mid to high twenties). It has plenty of power to pull the hills.

Our odometer spins up over 300 miles a week, but the car has never stranded us. The only shop visit so far was for work on the front brakes.

When we bought the Sephia, we wanted economical, reliable transportation. We got exactly that. As you read the negative reviews about this car, keep in mind that most of the cons that people are citing can apply to almost any automobile.
