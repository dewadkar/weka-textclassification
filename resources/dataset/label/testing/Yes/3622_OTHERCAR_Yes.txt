            I have always wanted a Pontiac Grand Prix.  Since the GTP remodeled in 1997 I have wanted it even more.  I purchased a 1999 GTP and I enjoy every second of it.  The 240 hp supercharged series II 3800 280 lbs of torque v6 handles like an 8 cyl.  Sit back, buckle up, relax for the ride of your life.  As I drive the car for the first time (I risked not taking a test drive and going on a dear friends opinion on this custom ordered car which was delivered to me in a 2 month period of time from the back up due to demand) I press on the accelerator going around the corner.  SCREECH!!!!  I lit it up.  From touching the accelerator, I left at least 300 feet of rubber.  I was thrown back into the the heated leather seat, by the way which is so comfortable and supportive all electric including lumbar support and all 9 yards, I was amazed.  The transmission shifts smooth and flawlessly.  Wind it up and it downshifts and takes off in a fraction of a second.  almost as quick as a stick.  I looked at the HUD (heads up display that shows from your speed to radio channel on the windshield so you do not have to take your eyes off the road) I had the car up to 40.  What a rush.  I saw the supercharger on the dash.  What pretty colors?  Yes, I slowed down, no one ahead.  Gunned it.  the super charger lit up like a Menorah during the 8 days of Hanukkah.  I was pushed into the seat.  the car moved from under me.  Thats what I call American Power.  Large, luxurious ride on 16&quot; Michelens, pwr moonroof, windows, locks, mirrors, radio controls on steering wheel, magnasteer, dual digital climate control, HUD display, onstar computer, integrated attena in back window, lighted mirrors with the premium light package, passport security system, flood lights, computer that monitors tire pressure, oil life and other items, large interior and plenty of trunk space, remote keyless entry, performance shifting, 8 spkr bose that knocks your socks off w/cd changer, bueatiful black on black with a paint finish that can blind you when the sun reflects off you.  Also, I noticed people stopping to look when I drive by.  The cornering is so precise with no body roll.  The car sounds muscle.  rev it up and hear it purr and roar.  This car will be my baby for a long time to come.<br><br>
