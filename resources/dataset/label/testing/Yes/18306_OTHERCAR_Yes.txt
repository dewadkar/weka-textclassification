            I would tell anyone to buy this truck if they want a great truck
I have ridden in a 1999 F150 and it can't compare to a 1999 Ram. The      Ram leaves all other trucks in the dirt. It is the most comfortable 
truck I have ever been in. It's more comfortable than a lot of luxury
cars with more room. in the quad cab there is room for the whole family
and with the 4x4 feature it the best off road of any 1999 truck and 
a powerful V8 Magnum under the hood you get great gas mileage and power 
in one. The A/T does not jerk when it shifts up and a automatic overdrive
for freeway driving and going up hills. This is a great truck for bigger
people I know because I am a bigger person and it fits me fine.
You can not beat value of a Dodge Ram<br><br>
