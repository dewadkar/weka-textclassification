            On Wednesday, March 1st My family and I went out car hunting! We were looking for something big but not to big. This family had a few new members added and we needed something for eight people! This van is just right!

I love this van. This mini van drives so good and it has a great radio inside it! It has an AM/FM CD. This van seats 7 passengers. The great thing about it is it has two child seats. I have an 18 month old son and my brother has a two year old son. They come in handy so we don't have to lug them big car seat's in. The dealer told us the van comes in four exterior colors such as Patriot Blue, Aquamarine Metallic, Bright Silver Metallic, and Shale Green Metallic. My parents went with Patriot Blue. Its a very nice color!

Well, I haven't drove this van yet but I have been in it a few times. It drives so smooth and calm. My father said it has the best steering yet and it has great lights for the dark. I agree with him because when we went on a long ride in the country the lights lit up the whole road. It was very peaceful and relaxing, no loud noises or uncomfortable seats! It was a great ride...

I would recommend this van to anyone with a big family or who just likes to have room and enjoys great comfortable rides! This is one of the best vehicles we have owned so far!<br><br>
