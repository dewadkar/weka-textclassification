            We bought our 1999 GMC 1500 SLE about 6 weeks ago and I can't even imagine 

driving anything else ever again!  We searched and searched for the right 

vehicle for our needs.  We have three teenagers, who have myriad friends, 

a dog and a cat.  I had two requirements in a vehicle (other than 

affordability)... it had to be non-smoking if used, and the kids had to 

be as comfortable in back as we were in front.  We found our Suburban at 

a local dealership 2 days after it had been traded.  I called the 

previous owner (he listed his name and number in the owner's manual which 

was in the glove box) and he assured us that the only reason that they 

traded was that his wife could not drive it in town.  She had already 

dented the bumper by hitting a gas pump.  She had been driving a small 

car before they bought the Suburban, though.  I love driving this 

vehicle!  It is like sitting in a recliner in my living room.  The 

leather seats are comfortable with an adjustable back support, and the 

heat/air is a dream. I am the primary driver, and I have had no problems 

cornering.  The ride is smooth and virtually noiseless. The kids have 

long legs now, and the room to stretch them out.  We cannot wait to take 

a road trip, and are just waiting for Thanksgiving when we are going to 

Branson.  We are looking forward to the long ride with 7 people in the 

vehicle.  I can't say that this would be the case with any other vehicle.

Ours has a standard stereo system with tape and CD.  I would like to turn 

the music to the rear so that the kids can hear the music and I can still 

carry on a conversation in the front.  That is my major gripe. The only 

other negative that I can imagine is that we seem to meet ourselves 

coming and going.  In our area Pewter is the favored color, and there are 

4 Suburbans just like ours in the neighborhood. We must get something to 

tie to the antenna so we can tell which one is ours in the Kroger parking 

lot!<br><br>
