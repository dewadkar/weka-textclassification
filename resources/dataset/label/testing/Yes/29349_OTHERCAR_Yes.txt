            When our first child came along, we had a Geo Prizm and a Saturn sports car. Well, our battery died in the Prizm and our baby became very ill. So, we proceeded to pack us 3 in the Saturn coupe. With both of our long legs and the infant car seat, we couldn't all fit! At that point, we went looking for a new car.

We looked at Luminas seriously. We heard that the EPA might be putting restrictions on SUVs so we didn't seriously consider them. But, when we found the CR-V with higher gas mileage and all the perks of other SUVS, we were sold! What attracted us to the CR-V was that it had as much, and sometimes more, room than the other SUVs that cost about $10K more. Also, the gas mileage was one of the best in SUVs. Our driving is about 97% city, so we didn't have a problem with it being a 4-cylinder. It's sporty and attractive design appealed to us as well. It drove well and had all the power options I wanted. And the price tag was what really made the decision. It had all we needed and wanted, at a very reasonable cost.

Now that we've had it for about 1.5 years, we don't have any complaints. It hasn't given us one problem and looks like new. We're expecting a second child and there's more than enough room to accommodate &quot;it&quot;. Even if you have a family with teens, there's plenty of room in the back. My husband and I are on the taller size (6'1&quot; and 5'8&quot;) and even when we're in front, there's enough room for our toddler's car seat and two adults in the back. 

The only thing I wish we would've bought is an integrated child seat in the back, if they even offer it. With two car seats in the back seat, it would have provided more room. <br><br>
