            	I have a 1992 Range Rover County, and there has never been a greater testament to reliable engineering. In 7 years of ownership, there has never been a problem with the engine. Granted, the older British electronics are not so reliable, but other than that I have only had slight leaks from the power steering fluid hose and the radiator fluid. I had to replace the alternator once, and it vapor-locked once, but that's because I was flooring it with no gas in the tank (smart guy that I am!)

	Given that there's more than 150,000 miles on the odometer, though, these problems are very minor and the fact remains that I have never had a serious problem with the Range Rover--in fact, the last time I took it for a general check-up, the dealership offered to buy it, telling me that the engine block had absolutely no leaks or timing problems or anything!

	I call her Bertha and she has treated me very well. My RR has been in 3 accidents, including one in which a friend of mine was rear-ended by a Ford Escort. The Escort was totalled, the driver lucky to get away with a broken finger and bad bruising. Bertha was dented in the rear bumper, the rear door panel, and one of the rear side panels had a slight crimp in it. My friend felt the impact but was not at all injured or even jarred. The Range Rover is a very safe car.

	With most of its weight in the chassis, the Range Rover is surprisingly stable, despite its top-heavy appearance--the bodywork is mostly aluminum, to keep the top light (with roll bars built in, of course!). It can bank up to 45 degrees, which is an awful lot, and although the air shocks allow for a little sway around corners, one never feels the threat of a roll. Although the relatively small 3.9-Liter V8 engine does not produce an awful lot of horsepower, it is designed, rather, for low-end torque, which is a strongly desired attribute when either hauling or off-roading. With full-time 4-wheel-drive and computerized traction control (yes, even in the early models), one never risks loosing the road--the manual even &quot;suggests&quot; that when driving, you keep &quot;at least 3 wheels&quot; on the ground at any given moment. It can ford deep water (risklessly up to 3 feet without any flood protection), which came in useful during El Nino in Laguna Beach, CA, where the police only let qualified vehicles in and out of the flood-trapped town.

	The one downside to the way the engine is geared and the greater than 4,000 lb (curbside) weight of the Range Rover is that she is quite thirsty; the 18-gallon tank will usually take you about 280-300 miles, and the Range Rover definitely demands 92-octane fuel, so it's not cheap to run. If you can afford one, old or new, however, there are very few better SUV-type autos out there. On the road, the Range Rover is perfect. With incredible luxuries and comfort, it is a perfect road-trip car, and desirable under any (especially bad) weather conditions. Off road, she is second perhaps only to the Land Rover and the Hummer. A wonderful car--I love her dearly, and as a Range Rover owner, so would you!<br><br>
