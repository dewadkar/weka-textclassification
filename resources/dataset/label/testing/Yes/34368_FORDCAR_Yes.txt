            Have had our 1998 Taurus SE now for 1 year.  It was a 'program car' with 20,000 miles on it.  It has the optional 24 valve engine.  Overall, I am very pleased with this car!  I have always owned Jap cars/trucks because of their outstanding reliablity, and have always been sceptical about owning a domestic vehicle.  

Well, I decided on the Taurus (mainly) because of its outstanding safety features and safety record.  It has dual airbags, and four wheel disc brakes (anti-lock).  I have got to say, I wasnt impressed with its &quot;egg shaped&quot; styling.  It has since grown on me a bit.  Probably because the Taurus is quite popular and you see them everywhere anymore!

I have since put on another 25,000 miles on this car.  No problems whatsover.  No significant rattles, other than the slight dash rattle that existed when I purchased the car a year ago.  What I like about this car the most is the engine.  This baby is smooth and powerful.  I recommend the optional 24 valve duratec v6 engine.  200 hp.  It has plenty of passing power.  No hesitation whatsoever.  Gas mileage isnt bad either.  27 highway.  22 city.  

Oh, I didnt like the stock tires (general brand).  Proved to be very &quot;squirrely&quot; on icy roads.  I opted for some Bridgestone Blizzak winter tires.  What a difference!  And for the summer I run Firestone Firehawk sh30's.  Nice tire from what I've seen so far.

I do wish the vehicle had more cupholders.  The two in the console just dont cut it.  My only complaint!
