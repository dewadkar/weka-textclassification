            Mercedes Benz makes such prestine cars inluding the E55. The E55 is the normal E-class that is customized by A.M.G. and is capable of speeds up to 155 mph! What a family car huh?

What is great about this car is that it rides just as smooth as the normal E-class but when you step on the gas the tires will brake loose! The car has a 5.0 liter V-8 maxed out to the maximum. 

I own this car and when I took her for a test drive I really couldn't tell that it had the huge engine inside it. This car will really impress your friends!

What A.M.G. did to this car, was put a much bigger engine in it, ground effects, new rims and different paint colors. Mercedes Benz owns A.M.G. so the parts are especially designed by Mercedes Benz than sent to A.M.G. to make them faster.

IF you are looking for a sedan with great power this is your car! This is not just the average V-8. This is a street legal racing car. In a race this car would probably beat the BMW m-3 and the Mercedes SL 500.

I totally reccomend this car to all families that need a car with great power! I own this car and it has been the most trouble free car that I have owned. Buy this car right now, but it is pricy. <br><br>
