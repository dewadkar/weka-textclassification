            The First generation Nissan Altima is probably the single best used car buy for people looking for a roomy, yet compact 4 door sedan with a touch of luxury and a driving experience more exciting than that of many comparable cars in this price range. Let me set the record straight, just so there is no confusion.  The car I am talking about here is the First generation of the Nissan Altima.

These cars were produced through the 1997 model year.  Beginning with the 1998 model, the Altima grew slightly and lost some of its sprightly character, thanks to added weight.  However, the second generation Altima is still a great car, providing a more inviting interior than any of its imported competitors, and unique (if not daring) exterior styling, along with more of the good stuff it always had.

Slotted between the Nissan Maxima and the Nissan Sentra in size, price, and power, the Altima gives you many of the features of a Camry, Accord or Maxima, without the premium price usually associated with cars of that caliber.

You see, Nissan has always had a slightly &quot;different&quot; way of doing things.  Both the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord come in either four cylinder or six cylinder variants.  Bucking this long long-established trend, Nissan actually has two cars available to compete with both of these models.

The six cylinder Camrys and Accords must do battle with the almighty (read: powerful and an absolute blast to drive) Maxima.  The Maxima definitely gives you more for your money than either the Camry or the Accord.  It's roomier, more powerful, faster, a great drivers car, and it's loaded with something both the Camry and Accord lack: character.

The 4-cylinder Camry and Accord must square off against what has become known as the &quot;baby Maxima&quot;. Like it's competitors, the Nissan Altima provides plenty of space for four adults and an astonishingly large trunk.  It's 150hp 2.4L (2,400cc) engine is eager to rev, and reportedly very reliable.  Both the Camry and the Accord are slightly larger and heavier than the first generation Altima, but perhaps this is what enables the Altima to easily out-handle both cars.

Inside, the seats are comfortable enough, if not fantastic (then again, have you sat in an Accord lately?).  There is plenty of room in both front and back for adults to sit comfortable -four of them.  Theoretically, a fifth adult can be squeezed into any of these sedans, but they definitely would not be happy about it.  Three children, on the other hand, fit very well.

One of the things I have always liked about the first generation Altima was the tastefully done dash and center console.  Sporting a neat two-tone treatment, the dash also includes a wide strip of simulated wood spanning the entire width of the dash.  Interestingly, this is a very classy touch, reminding me (a lot) of a very similar piece of (real) wood found in one of my favorite cars: the Lexus SC400 coupe.

Let's turn the key� Under the hood lies one of the industry's best four cylinder engines.  The Altima's powerplant is both lively and economical, producing 150 hp while returning a refreshing 22/29 miles per gallon (city/highway).  Mash the pedal to the floor and you are rewarded with a buzzy growl rising in both volume and urgency as the tach climbs towards redline.  Of course, I am a freelance automotive journalist, and I drive like that a lot.  You might be less �um� enthusiastic with the accelerator, in which case you will be pleased with the smooth power delivery and capable application of that power to the pavement.  :-)

This car does is not without it's shortcomings, however. When pitted against the slightly more expensive Toyota Camry and Honda Accord four cylinder cars, this car feels less refined -a worthwhile price to pay for the added sportiness factor which is all but absent in the other two cars. There is no question that the Camry is the smoothest car of the three, with the Accord falling somewhere in the middle.  Of course, both used Accords and used Camrys (of comparable model years) cost several thousand dollars more than a used Altima.

It all comes down to what you value more in a car: a smoother ride or a sportier soul.  The Altima is by no means a rough riding car, but it definitely is not anywhere near as smooth or sedate as the Camry.  The Accord would be a good compromise, were it not more expensive than the Altima.  I personally could not justify the extra two thousand dollars (+) for the Accord.

Today, a used 1997 Nissan Altima can be had for about $11,000 to $13,000, depending upon condition and mileage.  Conversely, a used four cylinder 1997 Toyota Camry or Honda Accord will cost you between $14,000 and $19,000, depending upon the same two factors.  These prices might seem high to you if you have been looking through the auto trader, but bear in mind that I am talking about prime examples of these vehicles -not the average junk you will find in the paper.

Anyhow, I hope you liked this Epinion.  It is one of my shorter ones, and for this I apologize.  I am a sports car/luxury car guy.  Transportation cars just don't get me all that excited, ya know?  ;-)
