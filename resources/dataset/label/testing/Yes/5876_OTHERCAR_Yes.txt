            I bought my 96 Beretta (3.1 liter engine, but not a Z26) with 14,000 miles on it in 1997. I have had very few repairs. 

I now have 132,000 miles on it and have only spent on the following: 

Exhaust intake manifold gasket: $500 installed 
Paint Job $500 
Alternator: $90 (new, not used) installed by myself 

The paint job was because of GM's lousy paint jobs for that model year. Paint was chipping off in chunks and rust was starting. It now looks like a brand new car since the paint job. 

Any car with as much mileage as mine will most likely need a new alternator. All other maintenance done is standard on all cars (oil changes, tires, battery, tune-ups, brake pads, etc..) 

I have kept up with the oil changes (every 3 to 4 thousand miles driven) and the car runs excellent! The engine is very strong and the transmission still shifts flawlessly (automatic). My opinion is: If you take care of this car, it will be around a long time. I believe I can easily get another 50,000 miles or more from it. 

About my driving: I do a lot of rush hour driving, since I work 9 to 5 in a city. I like to occasionally push the engine (or should I say gun it!) and it still accelerates like a champ. 

One recommendation if you have or buy a beretta: Get Michelin Tires! When I switched to Michelin, I got a much smoother and quieter ride (road noise on black tar roads is next to nothing). The new tires also stopped my car's tendency to skid in rain on acceleration. The 3.1 engine is pretty strong considering my car only weighs around 2600lbs (Z26's weigh more but have the same engine). POINT IS: buy good tires and you'll notice the difference. 

Future planned maintenance: 
New Front Shocks 
New Rear Struts 
New Transmission Filter/Fluid replacement 
Projected cost of all: $300
