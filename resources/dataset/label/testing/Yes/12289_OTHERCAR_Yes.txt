            I just bought a 2000 Eclipse GT, 5 speed, with sun and sound package(sun roof and Infinity stereo, etc).  I traded in my '97 Prelude ( a great Car) as the lease period came to a close.  I hated to say goodbye to the Prelude, but it was time.   I based my purchase decision on: Looks, Handling, Comfort, Features and of course -Price.   

REASONS I BOUGHT: The first is that it is the first year of a new generation - totally redesigned.  It's like being the kid on the block with the newest toy.    I also like the styling - it's a very futuristic look especially in the metallic silver color I have.  Pictures in magazines do NOT do this car justice at all.  It must be seen in person- see below.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS NOT ALWAYS CORRECT: Actually, I saw the first one in person on the highway. It was the purple color, RS model with no spoiler and I hated the way it looked. A week later I dragged myself down to the new car dealer, because I figured I owed it to myself just to check it out as a distant 3rd choice. Well when I got there I was blown away. &quot;Was this the same car I saw on the highway and in the magazines?&quot; I asked myself. I knew the second I stepped on the gas during the test-drive that I was buying one.  But, of course, I held my emotions in check with the salesperson - you know- I needed to keep my price negotiation leverage and all.

COMPARISON: I considered 3 other cars: 2000 Honda Accord EX, 2000 Toyota Celica GT, 2000 Mustang Coupe V-6.  Accord: Can't get a V-6 with a 5 speed transmission - HUGE ERROR BY HONDA.  Celica GT: It was too light and I felt every bump jar me out of my seat.  In terms of styling it's a nice looking car for someone about 10 years younger than me and in their mid 20's.  Too &quot;kiddish&quot; looking for me. Mustang: Lowest price of the bunch at $19,000 MSRP, but still overpriced and I can sum it up in two words - BIG DEPRECIATION.  

BALANCE: The Eclipse is a perfect balance of power, handling and comfort for me.  It feels very smooth for a sports coupe going over road imperfections, yet handles very precisely in corners,  The acceleration is Powerful and smooth, and the insurance rates are much lower than the previous generations Turbo model.

SACRIFICE: The interior is not made of the same quality materials as say a LEXUS, but then if it did it wouldn't be a $21,000 car anymore now would it.  Better to sacrifice here than in more important areas.

Mitsubishi has a WINNER in the 2000 Eclipse
