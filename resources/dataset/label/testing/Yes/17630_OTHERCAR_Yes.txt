            NOTE: This review is written with respect to the 2001 model year of the Saturn SC2.  

I bought my Saturn SC2 in September of 2000.  My trusty Honda CRX caught on fire after racking up 230,000+ miles on the odometer, and so it was time to buy a new car.

To be totally honest (and I don't pretend to speak for all or even most Saturn buyers), I did not decide to purchase a Saturn because the styling of the cars appealed to me or because I'd always wanted a Saturn or anything like that.

Rather, I decided to buy a Saturn for two main reasons: (1) I didn't want to have to deal with a slippery car salesman wearing white patent leather shoes and a greasy pompadour capable of withstanding 70 m.p.h. winds; and (2) I had friends who had owned Saturns for years and experienced no trouble with them.

The buying experience was every bit as pain-free as Saturn makes it out to be.  Basically, all I had to do was fill out a checklist of the features I wanted (after deciding on the SC2 model) and then the salesman whipped out his calculator and with a few keystrokes announced, "This is how much it'll be."  The particular model I wanted (SC2 with manual transmission, sunroof and leather seats) was in great demand at the time with few of such units actually being on car lots, and so I had to order mine as I wanted it from the factory.  

Almost immediately the sales manager was able to tell me a window of time in which "my" particular car would be manufactured at the Spring Hill, Tennessee, plant and also when it would be delivered to the dealership (approximately).

The only minor glitch in the process of selecting my car and getting it manufactured was that I had originally wanted side-curtain airbags in addition to the frontal airbags, but for some reason that option would have required my car to be assembled in a later production run about two weeks later.  Because I was sans wheels at the time and basically needed the new car as quickly as possible, I revised my order to omit the side-curtain airbags and get the car delivered more quickly.

The car arrived at my local dealership approximately 2.5 weeks later and it was exactly what I had ordered.  I just pretty much had to fill out the final paperwork and drive the car off the lot.

Word to the wise: I got tipped off by a friend who works at Saturn that when you take delivery of your new car, the Saturn dealership team assembles and engages in a song/chant to thank you for buying the car.  Since I'm the sort of person who hates things like when your friends take you out to a birthday dinner and then the wait staff puts a sombrero on your head and sings "Happy Birthday," I told the sales manager that I'd just as soon they put the kibosh on the exit ceremony.  He seemed crestfallen that I had gotten the inside scoop on the practice, but assured me that he could provide a "low key" sendoff.

Off I went and I've been enjoying the car ever since.  Now, on to some details about the car . . .

As I said previously, I wasn't greatly enamored of the Saturn styling even before I decided to buy the car.  Although the SC2 is Saturn's most "sporty" model, it is only a sports car in the most generous interpretation of the term.  The 124 horsepower, 4 cylinder engine is "adequate" for driving both around town and on the freeway, but it's certainly not going to impress anyone.  Perhaps that is actually a good thing, however, as an engine that does have enough power to impress is something that you're going to pay through the nose for, both at the insurance office and at the gas pump.  And, in any case, my desire to drive 130 m.p.h. on the freeway began to wane about 10 years ago.

The SC2 is a "three door" coupe that has a smaller wing door behind the driver's door.  On TV and in the Saturn brochures, this third door is touted as an amazing tool to get kids and groceries in and out of the car.  As it so happens, I don't have kids and I put the groceries in the trunk, and so I've maybe opened the third door a half-dozen times in the last 10 months.  That's not to say it wouldn't be useful to others, but it's not something that I use.

The fit and finish of the car is good and is commensurate with its moderate price range.  It's not built like a Mercedes or BMW, but it doesn't cost as much so the relatively lower quality is to be expected.

What I have found to be perhaps the most pleasant effect of buying a Saturn is the truly exceptional and courteous service.  When I take my Saturn in to the local dealership for service, the staff practically runs out to meet me, take my keys and get the car in to the service bay.  At least at my local Saturn dealership, the cost of regular service procedures is less than you would pay at a national chain like Jiffy Lube, and they give my car back to me washed and vacuumed to boot.  (An oil change with free car wash included is about $22 at the dealership here in Reno).

After each service visit, I get an e-mail from corporate headquarters asking me to report on the level of service I have received.  I've not yet had anything bad to report, but it's nice to know that the corporation wants to hear what I have to say.

All in all I'd say the SC2 is a very good (not great) car that provides reasonable value for money, and Saturn's excellent service is really the clincher.
