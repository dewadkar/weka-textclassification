            As a system administrator for an office full of busy engineers and architects I needed a camera that could perform simply, reliably and without a lot of training. 

Our office needed something to take quick pictures at the job site, bring them back to the office for review and/or distributions by email. This camera does all these things very well. Not only can they do that, but because it is on a 3.5 inch floppy (that you can get anywhere) they can throw it into a laptop on the site for review before they leave.

Bottom line: They LOVE it - how do I know? They USE it - and they can down load their own images without cables, wires or help from me.

Just slap the disk into any PC with a 3.5 floppy drive, open your web browser and off you go. 
No more half rolls of film waiting to be developed, no drop offs, no pickup times, no processing time, no high developing cost, no reason for bad pictures - review them on the site through the generous screen, if it's not what you want - take another one. We have been able to get 8-10 high resolution pictures per disk. After you are done the disks are reusable.

Even though this camera is not cheap - it paid for itself in about 45 rolls of film and developing - for our office it's not unusual to shoot 3-5 rolls at a time, so it didn't take long.

You can find a cheaper camera - but watch out for the hidden items like 'memory sticks', and adapters and don't disocount how easy it is to use.


Downsides - as with any digital camera without a special printer and paper the jpegs (digital images) do not translate as well off the computer screen.<br><br>
