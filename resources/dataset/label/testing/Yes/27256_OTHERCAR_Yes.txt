            Out of all the cars I've ever driven, I give this one a top rank.  It was one of the best things in the world watching people stare at me in these wheels.  I don't own this car, but if I had the cash I'd definitely buy it.

My driving experience was wonderful.  This is one of the most powerful cars I've ever put my hands on.  A true muscle car.  Not recommended for someone who likes to go the speed limit.  I had a hard time keeping under the speed limit.  After a nice country drive in this V8 320 horsepower machine, I took it into the car wash to make sure that it was clean upon returning.  When I put the drop down, not a single leak got inside.

The stereo in this baby is as sweet as can be.  They set this up so you don't need to get a custom.  The tires came as 17 inch blades, but my friend upgraded to 20 for 2 reasons:
1. This is a sportscar! it's supposed to look good.
2. Very low to the ground.  higher tires helped prevent scraping on hills and especially driveways.  Something to watch out for.

The engine is nice two.  It is available in V6 200hp or V8 305.  There is a premium package I was told about that gets you 320hp, a little bit of an upgrade.  Totally unnecessary for this ride, which already has a 5.7 liter in it.  One thing that I  wish they would have made better was the mpg's.  It says it can get 19 to 29, but I rarely found it with any more than 25.

The bottom line is that few people who are interested in this car don't really give a hoot what the MPG's are or who can fit all cramped in the back.  This car is for racing and looking at, not your children's field trips.  Overall, I recommend this car to anyone who can afford it.<br><br>
