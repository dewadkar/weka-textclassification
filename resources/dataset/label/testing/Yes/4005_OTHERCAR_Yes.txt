            The first car I bought &quot;on my own&quot; was a gold, 1993 SC2.  All my research pointed to the Saturn for safety, economy, etc. etc. - that which we all evaluate.  Blend that with the fact that my sons brought to my attention a little detail:  &quot;Mom, I thought you knew the car you've been pointing out to us for months was a Saturn.&quot; I knew I just liked the way &quot;that car over there&quot; looked, never dreaming the practical choice and the cute choice would in fact be the same choice.  So began my relationship with Saturn. 

The intention at that time was to buy a great car that would last 250,000 miles, because I've always felt it foolish to keep trading cars in.  Little did I know that the economy of Saturn makes trading-in quite the wise thing to do.

The history of that first Saturn included my life's only auto accident - totally the other driver's fault.  But the ease with which an insurance company evaluates Saturn coupled with the ease of repair at the dealership, reinforced the wisdom of my decision. The size of my growing sons motivated me to check out the larger, 4 door '96 SL2.  The real clincher was the incredible trade in value of the '93SC2.  Again, I've been impressed with the ease and convenience of maintenance.  

My third Saturn was a used '92 SL1 for my youngest son when he went off to college.  It too was a good experience, but the age of the car and amount of driving he did meant more maintenance than we first expected, so we traded it (again a good value) for a fourth Saturn - a used '99 SC2.  He loves that I love to drive it because when he's too busy working/going to school (now that he's moved back to this area) I don't mind trading cars with him to run it over for service.  And he enjoys driving mine.  Interestingly, this used vehicle required some major repair, however, it was still under warranty so Saturn's courtesy and willingness to correct and repair the difficulties has been impressive.  

In the last few months I've contemplated &quot;upgrading&quot; both in size and luxury, so I started test driving the two cars that caught my eye, just as I did in 1993. I've driven the Volvo S70 and the Saturn LS.  The Saturn wins, hands down, and that's without considering the difference in cost.  I thought I was just imagining this, so I drove them each again, and the Saturn still has my attention. The Saturn's ride is smoother and the Volvo's blind spots are the two top issues.  I expected Volvo to offer &quot;cooler&quot; features, but Saturn won there too.  For instance, the fold down back seat provides a locking system so that if someone should enter the car, they would be unable to get to items (perhaps stored for safety reasons) in the trunk without trunk key access.  

Since many of the LS series features are also included on the 2000 SL2, my only real decision today is whether to get the larger vehicle, or replace my SL2.  Trade in value remains so high that it has occurred to me that if I'm really a smaller car person, in a couple of years I could just trade again and get the SL.<br><br>
