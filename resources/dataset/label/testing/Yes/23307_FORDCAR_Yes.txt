            The Ford Taurus has proved to be the worst vehicle that anyone in my family has owned.  With only 30,000 miles over a period of 5 years and immaculate upkeep, this car was in need of some serious work already!  Never have I seen so many repairs needed to such a well kept, low mileage vehicle.  My mother had already had to replace the engine as well as a few other minor parts, but now this car needs a new transmission as well.  Unbelievable!  Needless to say we replaced the vehicle, as opposed to fixing it, with a Toyota.  I don't think I will ever consider purchasing a Ford again, based on the all of the negative experiences my family and I have had in the past.<br><br>
