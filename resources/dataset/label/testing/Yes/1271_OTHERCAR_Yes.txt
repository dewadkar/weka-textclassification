            No doubt, this is one of the best consumer digital cameras that are out there. The camera features both auto and manual modes. I have mostly used the auto function-- and sure it takes exceptionally sharp pictures in different light conditions. I have taken some very close-up shots and the auto mode handles it very well. The manual mode will give you full control of your shots. 
It comes with a Lexar 16MB flash card. You can save images in three different modes: Basic, Normal and Fine. With Basic you can get almost 44 images on a 16MB CF; with Normal about 21 images and with Fine about 12 images. 
One thing I don't like about the camera is it's size. It is a bit too big in size. It is a bit heavy too. I don't like the swivel lens also. You will probably have to use both hands to hold it to take shots. A better alternative would be Nikon Coolpix 880. 
But as far as camera capabilities and picture quality are concerned this one will be hard to beat. <br><br>
