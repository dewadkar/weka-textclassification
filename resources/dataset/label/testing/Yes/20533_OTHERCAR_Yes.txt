            I own the '99 LXi Gold model and have really enjoyed it so far.  It has a nice smooth quiet ride until I go over 60mph and tends to be more noisy.  I can not say I shopped around alot to compare because I bought it from my brother who is a Chrysler dealer.  However I was very surprised to see the quality and features I could get in a sub $20,000 car.  I will keep my fingers crossed and take care of this vehicle for at least the next 3 years before moving on to something else or even possibly another one.  Happy driving! <br><br>
