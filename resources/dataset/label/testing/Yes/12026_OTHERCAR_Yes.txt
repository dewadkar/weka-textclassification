            If you are in the market for a sports car that defines the word &quot;fun&quot;, then the all new S2000 from Honda may be what you are looking for. 

With a 4 cylinder, 2000cc VTEC engine that makes 240 HP and revs to 9000 rpm, it comes as close to driving a race car on the street as I have found yet. (And this includes owing and driving 4 different Ferraris, Porsche 930 turbo, Lotus Elan, numerous Corvettes, and a twin turbo Camaro among others.

I bought this car after reading all the reviews in various car mags. Honda advertised that they will only import 5000 to the US each year, so I put in an early order and purchased the car at sticker from a local dealer. Many dealers are getting over sticker, but if you search around you probably will probably be able to order a 2001 model. 

i am about 6' tall and have plenty of room. Seating is very comfortable in the well supported seats. Starting up by hitting a &quot;start engine&quot; button instead of turning the key adds to the race car feel and puts you in the mood. The engine begs to be revved, and with only 2000cc, the torque below about 5000 rpm is not what you get in a large displacement V8, but once the revs hit about 6500, the VTEC power comes on like a turbo boost, and doesn't stop til the rev limiter cuts in at 9000. needless to say , the gearbox (6 speed changes with the flick of your wrist) must be (must is the wrong word because you'll love to) used.

The best feature of the car though is the handling. If you have ever driven a go cart you can have some idea of what it is like. Tight narrow turns can be taken at speeds that would put a Vette in the weeds. And by the way there are no squeaks or cowl shake from the Honda. It has a terrific, solid feel that you just don't get in a Mustang or Corvette

 
I could go on. The fit and finish are typical Honda quality. Reliability is yet to be proven, but again should be typical Honda. In short, if you don't love this car, you gotta be from another world.<br><br>
