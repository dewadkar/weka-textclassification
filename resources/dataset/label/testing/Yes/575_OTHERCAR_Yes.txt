            I have had this car almost a month now and I love it. I had to customize it slightly because I got a red car,  and they sold a ton of red so I see brothers and sisters everywhere so although its not a hot rod I put some nice taz stickers on it and a custom license plate.
 My friend thought the hubcaps were mag wheels until a further closer look by him. My sister who has a van was amazed by the trunk space.
 There is a ton of room in that trunk and both seats fold down separately.There is even 3 places to hold coffee tea or whatever and the drinks don't spill.
 The car is also very fast before I sold my car I had before I had this one a friend said that this car flew by him on the highway like he was standing Still. I also find it has the shape of a Saab! The only problem that I found was the cassette which I got sucks pretty much hardly any sound and those controls forget it and am either getting their cd player or installing my own cd player or cassette deck.
