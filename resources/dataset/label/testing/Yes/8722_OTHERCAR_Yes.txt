            I purchased my 1995 Pontiac Bonneville SE in 1997 Used.  It had 40,000 miles on it and it was a basic model. I bought it for $12,500. Power windows and door locks, AM/FM cassette, and Cloth interior.  The car is black with a black interior.  

The seats are roomy and comfortable. The SE model, unlike the SSE and the SSEi have a column mounted gearshift, which means there isn't a console, and that frees up more room in front for a third passenger or just more room for the driver and passenger.  The back seat is roomy. There is plenty of room for three adults in the back seat. The trunk is also large, and is great for picking up the relatives at the Airport.  The AC Delco sound system is pretty good compared to the 1994 model.  It's more powerful and clean sounding.  

The Engine is a 3.8L V6 Series II.  It's a 200 horsepower engine and is a very very reliable engine. 

Today the car has 96,000 miles and the engine is still running strong. The car has very good pick up.

The only cons I see in this car is that there is way too much plastic in the interior, it would be nice to see wood, or even synthetic wood like in the Monte Carlo, but that's okay.  Also I had a problem with the driver's controls to the power windows. The switches would jam up and sometimes not work.  Also due to excessive heat a couple years ago my headlight switch melted.  Other than that, I've just had a my struts changed at 85,000.  The car is still running strong and surprisingly quiet even at 96,000 miles.
