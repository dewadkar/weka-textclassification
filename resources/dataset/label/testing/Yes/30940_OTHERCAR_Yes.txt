              Toyota aimed this generation of the Supra at one particular market above all other; the U.S. The Supra had to be somewhat roomy, bold, and fully equipped to stand out from the masses of other similar 2 door sport coupes. It did, and in 232hp turbo form, the Supra is also extremely fast!


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
     

Most consumers won't be disappointed with the Toyota Supra's <i>performance</i>. The turbo's enormous midrange torque rockets this heavyweight to 100 mph in just over 18 seconds (according to published specs). Drive it really hard, though, the surprisingly precise steering and handling, and what initially feels like tenacious grip from low profile tires, starts to struggle a little, suffering sudden and often dramatic oversteer. Powering the 1989 Toyota Supra is a development of the inline six-cylinder seen in the earlier Celica Supra, but with a longer stroke and new cylinder head design. On top of the cast iron block is an alloy, four valve per cylinder head first seen in 1986, with twin, belt driven, over head camshafts. In Normally aspirated form this engine puts out a respectable 200 HP. Remember everyone, a 5.0 GT in 1989 had 225 HP, this 3.0 has more power per liter than any naturally aspirated American 1989 muscle car. For the turbocharged version, compression was reduced to an aprrox. 8:4:1 ( I got this spec on the net, so I don't know how accurate it is). And the ACIS (automatic control induction system) was dropped. An intercooler was added to Increase air density and hence produce a whopping 232 HP. (almost as much as the Grand National 3.8 Turbo).
           
This Supra has all the ingredients for a high performance front engined, rear drive coupe. Where you might expect to see struts, there are double wishbones with anti roll bars, and upgraded shocks all around. the small 3.0 engine is set well back in the engine bay to give almost a perfect weight distribution. Who says the Japanese can't make sports cars? 

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
       
The <b>Interior</b> of the Supra comes with power everything, leather trim, and almost any amenity you can think of (sorry no stock CD player). The Supra, by no means, is a poor relation. Ergonomics are almost perfect. The dash layout enables excellent use of the HVAC controls and all the gadgetry posted on the dash fascia. Amenities are everywhere. The interior is also roomy, the front bucket seats are very supportive supportive; loads of bolstering for both the upper and lower body. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
      

The exterior of the 1989 Toyota Supra makes it no super-model, however it's not a bad looking car whatsoever. If you want attention from the looks of your vehicle, perhaps a 300ZX would be better suited for your lifestyle. 
 
<i>Conclusion:</i>     

If you are looking for sports car that offers tons of value on the used car market then the 1989 Supra Turbo is definitely worth a test drive. Even the non turbo models are a blast to drive; something to keep in mind while shopping.
