            Having had the 320 slk about a month now and after a few brisk drives, I am pleased with the performance and the overall style points.  Mercedes knew their demographic's and did their homework, lots of gray haired 50 plus of us walking around the dealership with our spouse's (on a saturday, since there are no more soccer games and the kids are away at college now) looking at the M class and the SLK's.  I have owned and driven BMW's and the busy porsche 911, imagine driving a porsche with your latte and answer the cell phone if there is an emergency phone call, almost impossible, oh and downshift to third at 68 mph because traffic's slowing down.  This is real life, 97 percent of the time for most of us.  Sure, grab a six speed BMW Z and whip that bad boy around the mountain roads, lots of fun too, but how many times do we get all foamy after work and really need to hit the curves, I don't, but if you do, I suggest get a 1000 cc road bike or better yet, take up kick boxing. Then park your rag top later when you stop for a quick meal in the city and wait for someone to slash your top for something silly laying on the seat.  I have read and do believe that the BMW Z is more atheletic but I can be just as happy with vanessa williams over venus williams.  
MB Style: impossible to match for the money, catch yourself looking at the storefront glass when going by.  Serious Thank you Sir points when leaving the valet, not a restored toy like my Alfa veloce, but a calm, mature fun car that is fourth or fifth on my current ownership list and this car says so.  Good Country Club car, but take up tennis not golf, small trunk.  Better yet, live on the course, take your cart out for 18 and admire your SLK in the driveway.  The silly net behind the seats came off after backing up the first day.  Hard top is necessary, no noise or leaks that a rag top has.  
MB Drive: easy and smooth pull away power, but balky transmission and rear quater side to side blind spots, thus not a car to zip in and out of traffic with, even my son's Prelude can draw circles around this bolevard rider. Really uncomfortable headrests.  Sits very low to ground, but overall not boatlike feeling of previous Mercedes SL's that I have driven.
MB impressions: a little bouncy and soft when pushed, good over hiway ruts, steady and confident up to 97mph, with firm brakes, any faster and little creaks and ticks appear due to the top construction.  Automatic select shift hard to get used to if you are a full time stick user like me, I use it to slap down once or twice, but forget to go back up so I know there is a generous red line.  The raido is hard to get used to.  The first day I punched buttons in the armrest cubby and got Mercedes assistance talking to me live. Lots of buttons with silly icons. I always flick the cruise control instead of the turn indicator, so I always go rolling on thru the stops on resume speed.  Got the K-4 package, the body color is white and the seats are black and beige.  The carpets feel cheap, so I put in custom rubber black mats.  Needs Hawaian seat covers!
MB Recap: I drove the 230 and found it more fun to toss around and the engine was more willing, much like the difference of playing ball with a border collie or a german sheperd.  The 230 I would mate with the stick, but remember this is a Mercedes, be calm, reserved, cool and your shirts are pressed.  Get the automatic and forget this is your sports car.  Forget TT, boxster, even the BMWZ, they do not go from open air to hard top in less than 30 seconds.  Buy a bunch of polo shirts and get two Miata's if you want toss about fun.  I just like my Mercedes better when I look for it in the Lot.
