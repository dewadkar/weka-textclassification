            The Kodak DC-200 is a good beginner's digital camera.  It is easy to use and affordable.  The Kodak digital science software (included) takes time to understand.  Once you get the hang of it, it becomes fairly simple.  The E-mail feature of the software is a bit tedious.  The connection from the PC to the camera is easy.  In my opinion, the biggest problem with the camera is memory.  A larger disk may be purchased for added memory. This  camera will not replace a good 35MM camera for picture quality, but in the long run, it is fun to use.
