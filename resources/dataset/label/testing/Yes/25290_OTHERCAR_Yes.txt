            The GMC Safari has to be one of the best mini vans produced that it on the road today! It is highly versatile and luxurious. The Safari was produced for use a a 7 or 8 passenger mini van and also for carrying loads of cargo the other vans can't even touch. It is the only rear wheel drive mini van made today. The very reliable 4.3 liter vortec V6 comes as standard equipment on all models. I have a SLE version that carries 8 passengers but is still very roomy. One of the features I like about it the most is you can take all the rear seats out. Now the van becomes a truck able to carry several hundred pounds of cargo with no problems. The length of what you can carry is restricted to 8 feet which allows you to close the rear doors. Try to do that with other mini vans! The vans ability to carry all this weight is based on the fact that it was made on a truck frame. It also is one of the safest vans on the road. Two metal struts 4 to 5 inches wide extend from the front bumper to the frame which absorbs any substantial impact from a frontal collision as well as supplement the drivers side airbag in my model year. The only drawback is the lack of room when servicing the engine. But most vans are that way. 
In my opinion this van is a sure winner. The price is a little more expensive but you certainly get what you pay for. If you want a van that will give you years or reliable service, this is the one!<br><br>
