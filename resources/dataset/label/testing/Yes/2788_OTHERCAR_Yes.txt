  The Olympus D-340R is a GREAT digital cameras for beginners as it comes with great software to load the pictures.  We have switched to rechargeable batteries as regular ones get used up rather quickly when you use the back screen.  The back screen lets you see the whole picture as opposed to just the view finder with one eye.  The screen also lets you preview your pictures that you have taken, one at a time or 6 small ones at a time. 
     We have also purchased an extra smart card, which lets us take more pictures without having to down load as often.  This is a great feature for trips.  Depending on the setting; outside, large objects, in and outside, people activity, or great detail and close ups it depends on how many pictures you can get on a card.  Our one card holds from 80-260 pictures.  We usually take most of our pictures on the medium setting and they turn out great.  
     One of the neat features this camera has is sound when the picture is taken, it sounds like a normal 35 mm camera.  The camera also has a variety focus features, and flash settings. Also a setting to &quot;zoom&quot; into something.  It is not a true zoom but it does draw the subject in a little closer and bigger.
     As our first digital camera I think we made a great choice, the price isn't too high, the direction book leads you through the camera simply.  Extra smart cards are available from other places besides Olympus.  You can also buy a printer and put the smart card right into it and print out your photos.  All and all this is a pretty handy little pocket digital cameras.
