            We bought this car used last year.  It had 83,000 miles on it already, but still looked and ran great.  Not much has changed, except now it has 104,000 miles, and still counting.This is a perfect family sedan.  All of our three kids fit comfortably in the backseat, and there is plenty of room for groceries in the spacious trunk.  My husband likes the 3.1 liter V6 engine.  I like the sapphire blue metallic color that still looks almost new.  Last December we were hit from behind while stopped at a light in our Lumina.  The driver hit us doing about 30 miles an hour, and while our bumper was pretty much mangled, the frame itself took the impact easily with very little significant denting or damage.  I am actually a relatively new driver, so the fact that this car is very easy to handle, especially considering its size, is really important to me.  Maintenance on this car is easy as well, or at least that's what my husband tells me.My husband had always been loyal to Dodge, and in fact only the low sticker price on this car sold him enough to even think of buying a Chevy.  On the sad day that we have to say goodbye to this car, I bet it will be to buy another Chevy...and maybe even another Lumina. <br><br>
