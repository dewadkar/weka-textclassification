            As fore mentioned in a previous review My wife and I were thinking  of buying a new Durango. well we did and, I am very happy with everything that this vehicle has to offer!  I must compliment the interior designers from Dodge on doing a great job!  One would expect that a four wheel drive SUV would have a rough ride, this is so far from true.  The instrument package is very well lit and easy to read in night time driving.  This vehicle handles great here in the lousy Michigan weather, and we have yet to engage the 4 wheel drive. Both front and back seats offer ample seating and leg room for long trips, I also think that the seats in the back are extremely comfortable. The premium sound system with CD changer sounds better than any I have ever heard before.  The V8 offers excellent low end torque and excellent pulling abilities!  The body seems to be very sound and when you shut the doors you know they have some metal in them! (they dont sound like a bunch of recycled pop cans!) With all factors weighing in, the V8 and the size of the vehicle, I was very happy with the gas mileage that the vehicle gets!  I have to admit I was a little worried that we might need maps to all gas stations, but later found this to be un-true!  The suspension is that that reminds me remarkably of a sports car, very tight and does not have the typical &quot;lean&quot; in a tight corner usually encountered with a 4X4.  The steering is tight and responsive, and easily manuverable in tight spots.  If you are thinking about buying a new SUV I strongly recommend you stop by your local Dodge dealer and give this beauty a test drive!  I think you will be very impressed!<br><br>
