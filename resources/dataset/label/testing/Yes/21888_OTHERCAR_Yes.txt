            While I do not own the 5 Series, I do have a lot of experience driving these cars.  I have a Lexus GS 300, which I bought instead of the BMW, and I will tell you why I made that decision as well.

First off, let us talk about the superb handling of this car.  It, like many other BMW's, is amazing.  Crisp turning, athletic performance, even from the 528.  Virtually no body roll.  No drama handling, it just goes wherever you want it to go.  You never feel like you are going to go out of control.  Confidence inspiring to say the least.

The exterior styling is average.  It looks like many of the other BMW's, which can be viewed as both good and bad.  I for one was ambivalent on this point.  The newer 2001 design is a little bit more aggressive, which is good.

Interior wise, it is a mixed bag.  Things are relatively well placed, and most of the controls and components look and feel like they are quality.  It does have a very antiseptic look, though.  And, in my opinion, really does not look very good unless you get the Navigation option.  The cup holders, like those in many other German cars, are deplorable.  Flimsy, and un-functional.  The seats are firm and supportive, but not uncomfortable.  A good amount of room exists on the inside, although the drivers quarters are a little bit cramped.  The glove box is miniscule, and non-existent with the optional in dash CD changer.  The standard CD changer is in the trunk, which is a nuisance.  Some of the controls are hard to decipher what they do, and require a degree in BMW-ology in order to function them.  Once you get used to them, though, everything works as expected.

The quality of the switch gear inside, i.e., how everything works, is very good.  Multiple adjustments and gadgetry make this a fine automobile.  The only exception to the superiority is the audio system, when, even with the upgraded DSP system is still tinny and lacks bass.  There is a pretty comprehensive aftermarket for audio components on the 5 Series.

Overall, the 5 Series is an excellent automobile.  This review was more in line with the 528 than any other model, but I have also driven on several occasions the 540, and can attest that it is a ROCKET SHIP, almost too powerful for most everyday driving.  In a lot of ways, the 528 is a little bit more well rounded, and will be cheaper.  Some of these gripes that I had I also have with many of the other BMW models, and also with other German automobiles.  Perhaps it was my upbringing on Japanese automobiles that I am little bit biased away from German automobiles, I can certainly attest that BMW is the ultimate driving machine.

As I mentioned earlier, I was looking at this car, as well as the 5 Series.  I went with the Lexus for a couple of reasons.  While the Lexus has inferior handling, I thought the long term reliability prospects, the better dealer care, in my opinion, better looking and more functional interior, better exterior looks, and much superior sound system sold me on the Lexus.  Having said that, I will definitely consider the 5 Series for my next car.  I still lament the choice sometimes.  If the stereo had been better, and if it was a little bit more friendly inside, like it is in the 3 Series, I may have gone with the 5 Series instead
