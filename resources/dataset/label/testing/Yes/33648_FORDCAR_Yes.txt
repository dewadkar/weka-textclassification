            Fords, good old Fords.  I bought this Escort, because I needed a cheap brand new car, and that is what an Escort is for.  The thing I love most about my Escort, is the fuel milage, I get a lot of miles per gallon, I am not sure exactly how much, but I spend about $15 dollars a week.  The driving in this vehicle is outstanding, great suspension, and wheel control.  I love it.  I believe that kids who just received their driver's licence should purchase this car.  If you want a car with a lot of horsepower, this car is not for you, it has pick me up, but can't go that fast, if you want power by a Porsche! <br><br>
