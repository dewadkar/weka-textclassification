            My  baseline is my 2.5 year old C-3000Zoom, which has done me quite nicely. However, I was interested in 2 things: 1) more optical zoom 2) ability to provide more light easily for shooting in low light 

Got this from OneCall in 3 days.  Also, got an FL20 Flash.

Being familiar with Olympus, I fired it right up. All the openings were the same (Bat, USB, Memory Card.  Wished I could have kept my SmartMedia investment....have to sell that and the old camera I guess. 

XP recognized the camera with no need to install the software...(I already had Camedia 4.1 Pro).  It downloads pics twice as fast as the C-3000. The USB cables for each camera are different. 

Menu is different from the C-3000, but after getting used to it, I think it is an improvement. Shortcuts based on your actions are really cool. 

Lens cap architecture is improved...it goes around the extending part and if you forget it, it just goes out "with the extension".  No more grinding then shutdown. The lens cap also has a tether. 

It came with 4 AA NIMH's and a recharger that plugs in the wall. However the charger is slow...my Maha runs rings around it in recharge time. Bat life seems good so far. 

I like the EV viewfinder...COLOR!

The Zoom is great.  There are warnings elsewhere on the internet of High Zooms creating blurry pics because of the zoom.  This could happen, but if you use the "sports mode", it is not prevalent at all.  I took pictures of my kid hitting/pitching/running in a little league game at 8x from 60-80 feet away.  Very clear and stopped action well.  Just pre-focus the shot by pressing the button half way...then fire when ready.

The new Olympus pre-fixed modes are great...Sports, landscape, portrait, Port-land, etc.   Really easy to understand and use.

The FL-20 seems hard to find, but OneCall had it for 149.  I was surpised at the size.  Not to big.  However, it's light output is way beyond the built-in.  No red-eye either. 

Only weird thing is this.   I took a pic in the dark using the built in flash and another with the FL20.  The FL20 came out better, but when looking thru the EV or the LCD, it was darker when the FL20 was mounted. 

Took a bunch more pics on the 4th of July.  Great zoom, focus, prints, etc.  Indoor shots were really great using FL20. I had zero out-of-focus shots....whereby my C-3000 would always have a few "fuzzies".  Even my wife was 100% focused with only a 2 minute lesson from me.  

All in all...I'm quite pleased....I'll KEEP IT!
