            I resisted buying a SUV for years, because the little ones still rode like trucks.  Then I got a Suburban. I felt like Queen of the Road.  Crank that drivers seat up HIGH, and GO. It just begged for a road trip. Loved feeling safe, and being able to see so well.  Got to hate the turning radius in parking garages. Loved being able to load and unload groceries or whatever at a comfortable level.
Next vehicle was a Tahoe with cargo doors. Loved everything about it, except the gas mileage, but hey, it pulled a 32' camper over the Ozarks, with ease, and gas mileage dropped only a little in towing.
Then came the Escalade.  Just smelling that aromatic leather induces buyers lust.  Every option I ever wanted, and MORE were standard.  I would have never anteid up for heated leather seats (front and rear)for heaven's sake, but found that I used them instead of the heater on winter mornings. That heat all the way up to my shoulders was pure bliss.  You can have 2 passengers in the back each listening to something different per earphones in the way of music, while you still control what you listen to in the front. Classical in the front, country western and rap in the back. AH-h-h-h peace.
The On Star system is really cool, but would only be fully utilized by someone spending lots of time in the car, I think. Should be a salesman's dream in being directed to clients never visited before, or for folks who travel a lot. Men will finally have a good reason to NEVER STOP for directions. They won't need to. Press the button on the overhead console one time, keep your hands on the wheel, and tell the nice lady where you want to go. She'll tell you exactly where you are, and how to get there from here.  The cost of the full service at almost $400/yr is high for someone like me who commutes less than 10 miles to work, and really only takes road trips once or twice a year. The security of knowing that help would be dispatched if the airbags deployed and no one responded to the On Star Advisors call is vastly reassuring however. It is nice to know that accidents that might take you off the road, and perhaps make your car invisible to others never make you invisible to On Star.
Now for the cons: mileage about 15 mph around town Limited rear visibility due to extremely high head restraints for the rear seats ( I had to remove the one on the passenger side to see at all) as well as the rear climate control housing.  Mine has the tailgate with lift hatch and I really hate it.  Looks cool, but is very inconvenient for a woman. Reaching in over the dropped tailgate for groceries is a pain, and forget hanging any clothes in the back, unless you don't mind throwing your body over the tailgate and rolling around in the back while struggling to hang the blasted things up.
In all, pricey, but plush.<br><br>
