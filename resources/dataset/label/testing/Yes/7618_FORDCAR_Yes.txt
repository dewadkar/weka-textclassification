            The 1995 Ford Mustang GT convertible I purchased went a long way to improve my social standing. Rather than a wimpy "Sport-Cute" or boring Honda Accord, all of which were in the same price range, I picked the sexy fast mustang with the legendary 5.0 liter engine and every option available. To start with, let's look at the benefits. For one, I was most impressed with the optional Mach 460 Stereo sound. For a stock system, this delivers excellent, crisp sound, even at 70MPH with the top down. After two years, however, the CD player developed a quirk of eating CD's in Hot weather. For a convertible, this is not a good quality. Next, the engine. Though the 1995 only cranked out 215 Horsepower, you would never know it. The heavy clutch and steering and the sheer frightening acceleration of this engine gives the impression that you are in a much more powerful machine. Even with the A/C running full blast, I have out run a number of more expensive cars, both from a standstill and at a top-speed roll-on. 

It is top speed where this car excels. Around town, the Mustang feels like a pig, with heavy steering, a muscleman clutch and reeeeeeeal bumpy ride. Every single pothole seems to point to the shakes, rattles and shudders that are inherent with a Convertible, especially a front-heavy GT. At 30-45, the wide, low tires easily get caught in road grooves and the car can be a handful to keep even going straight. But at 65 and up, the ride is smooth. The wind whips by, and the dieseling of this high-strung engine is gone, left with the sublime rumble of pure American muscle. I have driven quieter convertibles before, but I have also driven more noisy. I most enjoyed this car during a 2 week road trip where most of my driving was done over vast highways at top speed. All this, not to mention, the looks you get in this car, in my opinion, a much classier, yet more outrageous design than the faster, cheaper ho-hum Camaro. The Mustang has an aura about it what has drawn both teenagers and seniors into casual conversation. When you buy a Mustang, you join a wonderful club, much like owning a Harley Davidson or lighting a cigarette with a Zippo. Americans know this car, and you will be known for owning one. 

Now, to the unfortunate realities of Mustang ownership. I will say this under no uncertain terms, DO NOT BUY THIS CAR IF YOU NEED TO DRIVE IN WET WEATHER. This means rain, snow and sprinklers. The pre-1996 Mustangs were not offered with traction control, are rear-drive, front-heavy dogs that become bobsleds in the slightest of moisture. I have put 4 sets of tires, from Michelins, to Pirrellis to Yokohamas, and it does not help. The width of the tire ensures that you will ride high above any snow and the high-speed Z-design ensures that water will become a venerable oil slick under your wheels. If you live in Sunny California, this is a great car. If you live in Montana, look around. 

Next, the gas mileage. Nobody expects Honda Civic-like effeciency out of a 20-year old design V-8, but the city mileage I returned in this car still astounded me. On the highway, I could expect a respectable 20-24 MPG, but around town, during the hot summer, AC on or off, if you break 13 MPG you've had a good run. 

Finally, be aware of repair costs. In my 3 years in this car, I have replaced tires once annually, put in a new radiator, water pump, brakes, distributor, two windows that got shattered by the convertible top and needed a tune up at 65,000. None of these repairs, though some were expected, were inexpensive. When a short in the rear-window defrost shattered my rear window, it cost $1400 to replace. Another $1100 went into the rear quarter window when it fell out of allignment and was pinched by the convertible. The Radiator was $800 and the Water pump $550. Each set of tires will run you $600-1200, and they WILL WEAR OUT FAST. 

The back seat is best reserved for short friends you don't respect very much and the cupholder is a wonder of modern afterthoughts. This unfortunate pattern can be found throughout the cabin, with a gear-shift that blocks the CD player, a brake handle that knocks your drink over and a brake/gas pedal assembly that makes spirited heel-and-toe shifting impossible. 

In the end, the Mustang is a FUN car, very fun, but not practical. While a bargain at the price I paid, the upkeep in the form of Gas, Insurance, Tires and maintainence have made me wonder if I could have done better by spending the additional cash up front for a higher quality car. Test drive this car, and do it seriously, Drive over bumps, go on the highway and sit in all the seats. This may be just the car for you, and if so, welcome to the club.
