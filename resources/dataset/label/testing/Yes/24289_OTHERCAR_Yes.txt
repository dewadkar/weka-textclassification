               Ok, if you have read my other review, bashing my last car, the infamous Toyota Celica, you can relate to this more.  So, read it :-)  But, for this one.  I love my Jeep!  I used to complain about my last car, so I ended up with a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  White.  Not my color choice, I like that blue one they have out. Those are pretty.  But, I have white.  So, I will live.  The outside is good looking, the inside equally fabulous.  I mean, it has more lighty things on the inside than a Gulfstream 5 (which, happens to be my ideal airplane.  Also, on that note, my birthday is in April....just a hint). 
   So, back to the car.  It is slow.  I mean, slower than me finding a boyfriend.  Slower than me doing calculus. It is just that slow.  But, I have the V6.  I drove the V8 just the other day and damn!  That is much faster.  So, my loss I guess.  But, it is still good for me.  I am on probation for speeding, so it is a good idea.  I used to drive over 120 mph in my Celica, then I drive like 80 in my Jeep.  I got a ticket in the Jeep.  I was not a happy person. But, I am slower (which, helps my probation for my speeding).
   So, as for why I like it?  I feel BUTCH driving it. I am not sure why...as it is like a family car.  But, compared to my go-kart of a last car, it reeks machismo.  And, so goes my review of the best car made (except that it is American, so it is bound to fall apart quickly...jk.  Mine has a lot of miles on it and is great!)
