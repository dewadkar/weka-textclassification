            I bought this car largely because of its looks (sporty and curvy), handling, price, and warranty (10 year/100,000 miles).

The car was a little cramped when I test-drove it but I figured I could live with that.  One year later I began a job which required me to drive long distances and it was then that I realized that the car was too small for me (I am six feet tall).  If the sun roof was down, I would need to continually lean to the side to avoid banging my head on bumps.

The other problems were minor.  The window could not be rolled down in the rain because there was no guard to keep the water out.  The drink holder was directly in front of the opening for the cassette player and during a hard stop half my coffee went right into it.  If the lights were left on when the key was removed then the headlights would shut off but the parking lights would not.

That said, I loved driving this car.  People commented about it everywhere I went.  140 horsepower is more than enough for this car.  It has a very smooth, quiet ride, nice acceleration, and very good maneuverability.

Hyundai itself surprised me by really standing behind their warranty.  There were two times that my electrical system shorted (one because my coffee poured into the cassette player and one because I jumped the battery backwards).  Hyundai repaired all of this free of charge, and even covered the towing from the jumped battery.
