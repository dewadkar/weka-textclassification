            Take it easy playmates, we�ll get to the subject shortly. First you need a brief unwind.

Some years back my good wife and I escaped the clutches of the chickens and actually had a holiday � a real fair dinkum holiday. We reckoned we deserved it, not that the chicks aren�t perfect of course, it was just that we needed a break.

In those halcyon years before chicks we had done the same thing, that is made the same journey and it was one of the highlights of our married lives.

So what am I on about � it�s the trip from Adelaide to Darwin, some 2,500 miles straight up and through the centre of the country.

About twenty years had elapsed, and three major changes had occurred in that time � number one, the road to Alice Springs was now a properly constructed bitumen highway � number two there was a brand new train on a brand new track from Adelaide to the �Alice� and last but not least we had personally become fossils.
Being fossils we prefer to remember the old road and old train � the new one�s are boring with a capital B � all sleek and modern, nothing ever goes wrong, hell, the new train even runs to time! The thousand miles of outback it crosses is no different of course, its just the way it does it � smoothly, effortlessly and undoubtedly.

Let me digress a moment and tell you how it used to be. The main South Road, as it was called by the residents of Alice Springs had two things about it that amused me. The first, why main road? it was and is the only but the main thing was a daily announcement of its other name, which varied from the $500 dollar road to the $2,000 road, being the average cost of repairs to any vehicle that succeeded in making the trip. See what I mean, it put some life, some challenge into it. Now of course its no more difficult than driving an Interstate.
Now because of the notoriety of the road, most, including us drove to Port Augusta, about three hours scenic drive from Adelaide and where, in those days, the good roads ended. At Port Augusta the driver themselves would drive their own car onto the train, an experience I won�t ever forget, and then went to a normal seating type arrangement in the passenger section. This still applies today except passengers go to a luxury cabin.

As dumb as it sounds, each State set its own railway gauge in the early years, and of course they were all different. At every border trains had to be changed, a fact that plagued to country until quite recently. On our first trip the track changed about five hours north of Port Augusta, so a train change was necessary. At least from there we had our own cabin.

Then things used to get interesting � for the remaining approximately five hundred miles to Alice Springs the old track was in a very bad way. Very little maintenance had been performed since a new track was under construction to replace this one in the next couple of years. Due to track conditions the maximum speed for the whole journey was twenty miles per hour, but if the train ever reached that blistering pace I would like to know where.

On many occasions the train would stop completely while the driver and some other staff would debate whether to proceed.
Oh well, being a train at least we weren�t lost. After the third day food was running out but the chefs made some quite appetising meals out of leftovers. The Air Force was on   alert to fly food to us and drop it by parachute, something all the passengers were looking forward to. Unfortunately the rotten train driver decided to �go for broke� and make a run for Alice Springs � and even more unfortunately we made it!

The pioneering spirit seemed to take over all the passengers � we turned out to be the last old Ghan to ever run. Nobody complained and yet none of us new, at the time, we were part of an era lost and gone forever. Personally I still don�t know how I should feel.
And wasn�t 1888, but 1988.

Sure the new Ghan is great, but our minds were elsewhere as we crossed the desolate plains of the South Australian Outback.

Anyway we met up with friends John and Helen, who you met in �PEDDLING a TOJO - the real McCoy� and planned to stay a week. But bad news � John had to do his �aircraft engineering� bit for a few days but neighbour Bill and Dear Helen were going to take us for a Barby (BBQ � Cookout) the next day. Our memories of last time flooded back, which John realised, but he said this time was going to be different � we would find out in the morning.

Eventually we went to bed and I wondered what was in store for the next day. We all got up early and had a bite of breakfast � we were almost finished when Bill drove in a very near new Range Rover. I said g�day mate, you are bloody game bringing that thing in here, what with John�s Tojo. Bill said don�t worry, today you will find out what a real 4WD can do.

I thought � this�ll be good � a contest no less, and we are the suckers in the middle. 
As if to make things more interesting there had been a thunderstorm somewhere in the area so chances were we�d come across some mud eventually.
Range Rover�s are also very popular in Australia, but being more expensive than most their numbers are reflected accordingly.

Bill commented that if we could find where that thunderstorm fell he�d show us why a Range Rover is better than the more common Tojo but, says Bill �don�t tell John, but for the money the Tojo is bloody good mate, it�s just that these are better. Like get a load of this � Bill sinks his foot and the Land Cruiser rapidly accelerates down the bitumen all the way to a hundred miles an hour, effortlessly, smoothly and silently � well as silent as most cars anyway. The others can�t do that says Bill, and I have to agree.
In deference to the Highway Patrol he backs off pretty quick because even though there are no speed limits in the Territory, a hundred miles an hour is a little �over the top� � a more sedate eighty five is more appropriate.
And as luck would have it, all of a sudden there was some water lying off the road, obviously where the thunderstorm fell.

Hey, says Bill, this is Romany Station, just over a million acres � if we cut through here, there being no fences of course, we can avoid the Homestead which is sixty five miles to the South West and find a good spot for the Barby.
Now even I know that driving through what was only yesterday dry sand, rocks and worst of all Bulldust, which has a consistency virtually the same as talcum powder, is risky. The Bulldust is always in small areas but about a foot deep and one wheel in one of those and the others just spin hopelessly, there being nothing to grip.

So I say �Hey Bill, you are joking right?�, even if we lock the hubs to make two wheels turn together. Relax Peter, says Bill and stay inside the Rover. Well off we went, no worries at all for a little while and then all of a sudden one side of the vehicle �falls� down what would be a particularly large Bulldust hole/trench � Bill makes a very quick move and the Range Rover, which had almost stopped crawls its way out � now nothing can do that!! And even I knew it.

Beat that!, says Bill.

Well that was it. See Bill had locked all four wheels together at the push of a button! � and not just once but numerous times throughout the day.

When a shady spot loomed up, after the terrain was all dry again we enjoyed a lunch that can only be enjoyed in the Outback. Regularly everyone stops talking, just to hear nothing, absolutely nothing. Not a sign of the two legged Homo Sapien in sight, nothing, just nothing. This cannot be experienced within at least a hundred miles of any city or town � believe it or not the background noise of cities and towns carries that far, as do the lights incidentally.

We live in screaming noise that we have learnt to block out � you don�t believe me? � do this and you will have serious thoughts of selling everything to be able to do the same � all the time.

White-eyes need a Land Cruiser to get there in all weather � is it any wonder the Tribal Aboriginal is very happy with his lot in life?

So what do I think about Land Cruisers? Surely that�s obvious by know.

And if you want to know what makes all this possible, ask the dealer when you pick yours up or have a look at the manufacturers page attached.

The trip from Alice Springs to Darwin will be in a very different vehicle � watch this space!
