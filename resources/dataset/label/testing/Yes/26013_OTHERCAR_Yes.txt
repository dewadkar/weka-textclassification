            I just got a 2001 Chevy Cavalier LS, silver 4 door with pin stripping, spoiler, and power everything but seats. And coming from a family that has four chevy cavaliers two luxury sport, a Z24, and a basic model, I have driven a variety of Cavaliers. With mine with a sticker price of 15,000 it is so far a nice smooth ride and has great steering. I seem to like the power options except i wish it had power seats but of coarse they all have bucket seats and none of the Chevy Cavaliers have power seats. It has great power window but all buttons for driver and right front passenger is on the center console and no buttons on the doors,which if you're use to them being on the doors having them this way will take somewhat getting use to. The Cavalier LS has a nice sleek design, a nice rich paint job, has keyless entry and alarm, and cd player. The Cavalier I believe could have some more room inside which is probably mostly taken up by the center console and the width of the vehicle. Seems to be quiet inside no squeaks or rattling noises. Great car for a small vehicle, also great on gas on both highway and city. The car does seems comfortable for maybe the first hour or so. Very roomy in trunk and back seat does fold down for even more space. And is affordable depending which model you get even the Z24 Convertable is around $19,000.A great car for teenager or small family,very dependable and has safety features. could use a stronger engine.<br><br>
