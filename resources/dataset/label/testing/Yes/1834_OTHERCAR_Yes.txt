            We purchased our Sable LS in September from a private owner.  Actually, we're a 2 Sable family.  We liked the 1st. one, so we weren't afraid to try again.  It has everything we like in a car, especially all the bells &amp; whistles.  We also like the moon roof.  Never had one of those before &amp; didn't think I'd like one, but now I'm sold on it.  It has any kind of music player you'd want eg. cd,radio,tape deck.   I like the auto lights, locks, wipers etc.  If it has a fault, it would be that, because of the console between the seats, there is no room for my purse etc. <br><br>
