            We purchased our '96 Transport in '98 with 35,000 miles on it from a rental company.  It has been very reliable.  We currently have over 105,000 miles on it.  The fiberglass sides are great in Minnesota where there is a lot of salt used in the winter.  
The interior is very roomy and seats two 6'+ adults up front with ease.  We have traveled several 12+ hour trips and it was very comfortable.  
We tried pulling a u-haul with it from South Dakota and that caused the transmission light to come on.  We had it checked out and everything seemed OK but I am now afraid to do much towing with it. 
Gas mileage has been good at about 26 mpg.  The rear wiper went out early on and we have not been able to get it repaired. 
The seats inside are not completely interchangeable.  This is a nuisance that once  you understand where the seats fit is not a problem.  
From day one, the noise level inside has been very high.  We took it to a dealer who adjusted the door but that did not help.  It sounds like the drive window is always cracked just slightly even if it is not.  
Repairs have been very manageable.  We had to get the tie rods replaced and general maintenance. It has a slight oil leak which they have discovered somewhere that has been estimated at $450 to fix.  We chose to live with it.  That occurred at about 85,000 miles.  
This has been a very good vehicle for us.
