            I recently purchased this camera on the post thanksgiving day sale . I was earlier looking for 2 MP Digital but I got a good camera at a reasonably low price. Since then, I have used this camera extensively and I have got great picture qualities. 

Somehow I came to know about epinions.com and just thought about this camera to write a review. And that became my first ever review on epinions.com . The opinion was rated &#147Helpful&#148 by three members. I was happy and my interest in epinion increased. I noted that this was a new camera launched in October &#14602; and many people need to refer to review as evident by much more non member visits than member visits. This made me enthusiastic to edit my review to make it more helpful. Besides, I was impressed by the reviews written by Howard_Creech on professional cameras including the one on Sony F707. This formed the basis for a thorough revision for the review of this camera. 

CX4300 is a camera for the beginners and general public, easy to use &#150 fine. But it does have some feature which users must know.  One of these options is Exposure compensation. If you do not know when to set it you may not get the required quality in darks and in noon sunlight. You can vary the exposure compensation value in the menu from �.5 to 2.5 in steps of 0.5. The value 2.5 is to be set when it is extreme dark. It will expose the photographs for a longer time and make the photos look brighter. When you are shooting in sunlight reduce the exposure by setting the Exposure Compensation to -0.5 , -1.0 or -1.5 according to sunlight intensity . The idea is to experiment in a given light with varying settings of Exposure compensation and look where you get the best quality. Remember , this experimentation is not going to cost you anything but your time and dedication. 
Another feature one must try to get himself familiar is the close up mode. If you are taking any photograph that is closure than 12 inch you are should keep the Close Up setting ON in the menu. The focal lengths as mentioned in the camera menu are 0.3 meter to infinity in auto mode and 0.15 meter to 0.5 meter in close up mode. As the camera does not have optical zoom the physical distance between the camera and the subject is the distance that will decide whether to use close up mode or auto mode. Again it will require you to experiment with the two modes for same subject at same distance and see the difference. I have tried the camera only recently with close ups and the results are fantastic. But the drawback &#150 you need to bring the camera too close to object, since there is no optical zoom. It could irritate the person being photographed. Remember, you are using the strong flash that can irritate his/her eyes. 
The battery life is good in this camera. But one MUST purchase two pairs of chargeable batteries and a charger before even trying to use it. I started using the camera with alkaline batteries. As I had to use the LCD display to learn the features and menus the battery dried up at about 20 photos. In my subsequent uses I mostly used optical viewfinder and it is possible to take more than 100 pics in one go. The camera provides a socket for a 3 V adapter. But the socket is miniature and will not fit commonly used sockets. I have not done much research but , at this moment I can only say one will have to buy the adapter from Kodak as accessories. There are other brands of camera in this category that come with included adapter with the ability to charge the battery. I do think that Kodak could have improved their design to include the adapter with ability to charge the battery. This would not have exceeded the cost to them by more than $5. Instead they provide a separate &#147dock&#148 for charging the batteries and for transferring the photos to computer. The transferring of photo to computer is also possible directly from Camera using the provided USB cable. So the only advantage that the dock seem to provide is to charge the battery at a heft cost of $70. The advertisements say &#147one touch transfer&#148. You may better buy a separate charger and chargeable batteries that will cost about $20 and use the camera to transfer the photos directly instead of using the &#147one touch transfer&#148 of Kodak. To me it seems a gimmick of Kodak to earn through the sale of the accessories. 
When I open the box the actual manual is embedded among so many other advertisements. The advertisements and pamphlets for Dock, for Kodak batteries , for Kodak memory , for Kodak online printing. When a user opens a box the one and the only thing he wants is a simple manual that can get him started as soon as possible and not horrified by the add on&#146s he still has to purchase. 
I do recommend the users this camera for ease of use by I do not strongly recommend it. They could have added in built charger using &#147supplied&#148 Adapter. They could have added the web cam and the short video ( 30 second or so )  as other cameras offer. And for this reason I took out 2 stars from otherwise a good camera. I purchased this camera on the post Thanksgiving day ,and, so was a cheap deal for me at $154. It is currently being offered at about $200. Still not too bad for a family shooting.

Familiarize your friends with the use of camera that will help them your photos if you are going in a group. Else you will end up taking others&#146 photos and none of yours will appear. The camera is easy to use and for that reason I will recommend if for family users who want a digital camera. 
Digital zoom feature is practically no zoom since you can later crop the image and get the same result. 

<b>The pros:</b> 

1. High resolution of 3.2 MP - The high resolution allows us to expand and edit the photos. The file size with the best quality is about 1 MB. It also has the option of taking the pixels at lower resolution of 2 MP - the file size in that case will be about 500 KB. With the inbuilt flash of 16 MB this will give 16 picture of highest quality 3.2 MP or 32 pictures with lower quality (2 MP) 

2.Easy interface with Computer - The camera has Universal Serial Bus port and it is very easy to download the photos to computer. The camera dock is being sold extra, but I have not used it. I do not think that it is essential or required. It does not make sense for another $70 . 

3.Ease of use - It is easy to use. Supposing we ask a third person to take picture, it is not required to sermonize him about how to use it. In that way, absence of optical zoom and the absence of manual focus does help. 

4. Timer , Time/Date setting , TV Display - The 10 second timer display and the date-time settings are provided. Also the picture can be displayed on TV using the Video out cable provided. So, if your neighbor does not have computer, you can still show him the photos on his/her TV. 

5. Close-Up : There is a close up setting in the menu that can take close up snaps. The focal lengths are 0.3 meter to infinity in auto mode and 0.15 meter to 0.5 meter in close up mode. 

6. Exposure Compensation - You can vary the exposure compensation value in the menu from �.5 to 2.5 in steps of 0.5. The �.5 is for brightest and 2.5 is for darkest. 


<b>The cons:</b> 
1. Missing Optical zoom - Though the camera provides X2 digital zoom , that is not good enough for taking close-ups. But this camera is meant for easy to use and within a price tag. 

2. The lens cap does not fit. There seems to be a mechanical mismatch in the design of the mechanical cap. This irritates me. I need to take care of the lens cap every time I keep the camera. 

3. OK Button - The camera has OK and 4-way arrow button. But sometimes trying to push the OK button will instead, push one of the arrow buttons. It seems like the OK button should have a little mechanical depth. 

4. Picture quality in dark - Though the camera gives excellent picture quality outdoors and in light conditions, you may not get excellent qualities in a little dark places. 

5. No video, no cam , no included battery charger - It can not be used as web cam with computer. 



Extra items to be purchased 

1. I had to purchase a set of 4 chargeable battery and battery charger for $20. If you do not have these, then add another $20 to your camera price. 


2. The camera has 16 MB of internal memory. That will give you about 15 or 16 photos with highest quality. You can use it at 2 MP to get 32 photos. It still gives very good pictures , about the same quality unless you want to zoom the pictures in editing. But if you are going on a visit you will need to get a 32 MB Multimedia Card or SD card.
