            I bought my 98 Dodge Quad Cab last February, after driving several Chevys over the previous 8 years. I liked my Chevys, but I just wanted a change. I'd always liked the looks of the redesigned Dodge, but had never driven one. What a thrill it was to finally drive one! This truck had 59000 miles when I bought it and still had more power than my other trucks did when they were new. The Dodge seems to hug the road better than other fullsized pickups, too. Especially after I put new tires on it.
The size of these trucks is deceiving; at first glance they seem to be big and hulking, but once inside, they seem to be slightly smaller than the Chevy. I'm not saying the truck is small, just that it seems to be more manageable and the ride makes you feel like you're part of the truck. Mechanically, I've been very happy. Mine has started up immediately the first time and every time. Doesn't burn oil, leak anything, or make noises. I'd heard many negative things about Dodge's transmissions being less than great, but I've had no problems. 
I am so impressed with my Dodge truck that I've traded in my Expedition for a Durango. The fact that the Expedition was drinking up $40 in gas each week also contributed to that decision, but I am happier with the Durango also. (Same engine in both Dodges...5.9L V8) Granted the gas mileage in the Dodges aren't a whole lot better ($32/week), but I just like driving them a lot more than anything I've owned in recent memory. 
The only negative thing is the small size of the horn buttons. The area to press is very small, and difficult to hit instinctively when you need to blow your horn at some idiot. I 've noticed lately that with airbags in all newer cars, smaller horn buttons seem to be an industrywide trend, but at least they're not on the turn signal lever like Ford did in the early 80s. Still, I don't like trying to hit a target the size of a quarter when I need to use it.
Overall, I am now a Dodge man from here on out. This truck is fun to drive, more manageable in smaller areas than others and just rides more like a truck should. It doesn't ride like a Cadillac, but if that's the ride I wanted, I'd have bought one of those.
Like their ad says, over a million people have made the switch, and I'm glad I'm one of them!
