            I have just finished my second tank of gas on this car and I have had some great driving experiences and fun times behind the wheel of my new ECHO. I spent a great deal of time (as I was stuck at home with chicken pox) on the internet reading about all the 2000 cars in this class and joining discussions and reading epinions trying to decide on an auto under $15,000 that I would feel good driving that would also have the room and trunk space that I felt was important. I needed automatic transmision, dual Airbags, air conditioning, and I wanted a CD player and keyless entry.  In addition I thought ABS would be a good thing. I examined the ECHO, Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Mazda Protege, and decided on the ECHO. Why? Although it is ugly in a very cute way I realized I could get everything I wanted and needed (except ABS because there were no cars in California with ABS) for well within my price and could complete the entire transaction except the test drive and picking up the car over the internet.

What do I Love about this little car? First it is fun to drive.  Because it is light weight it gets the most possible out of it's four cylinders.  The pick-up getting onto the freeway is excellent and the ability to manuver in traffic is great. The car has many additional little &quot;cubbies&quot; for storage and a huge trunk. I have gone shopping for groceries with over 15 full bags in it and room was still available. The drivers seat is amazingly comfortable with the head rest placed so that for the first time in months my neck is not hurting after a long drive. I have had three back surgeries and seat comfort is important to me. This seat surpasses most. The car I got is a four door and the front passenger seat and the two back seats I have been told are just as comfortable.  The head room is great as is the leg room so it does feel as if you are in a bigger car. The gas milage has been a treat! right now I am getting 36mpg and This is with having driven just under 1000 miles. When driving you sit high in the seat an so there is a clear view all around.  This is an experience one usually get only in an SUV or Van. It is hard to imagine how a little tiny car can feel so big.

What I hate has less to do with the car and more to do with the aftercare. It needed work to install the keyless entry because it was a feature that the dealer couldn't find with everthing else I wanted and instead of the paid for entry system they installed an alarm that I didn't want and told me I would then need to pay for the entry system in addition to the alarm. That mishap was finally taken care of but as usual when I delt with Toyota I felt after the transaction that I needed body armor and a strong ability to fight back to deal with these people. This is the main reason my last three cars have been Hondas. It is a testament to the little ECHO that I went through the Toyota cauntlet.

If you want economy without sacrificing the pleasure of a fun driving experience and you want lots of space and you don't mind EVERYONE saying how &quot;cute&quot; (think ugly) this car is. Than do get this car it will make you happy.<br><br>
