            First things first...  This car has a 7500 RPM redline and sticks to the road better than anything in the same price range.  Car and Driver rated this car as a perfect 10 in the fun to drive category, and I agree wholeheartedly.  I've got a 5-speed and love it.  This car is first manual I'd ever driven and the high redline and smooth shifting make this car very forgiving for beginners.

That being said, this car isn't without it's faults (these faults apply to almost all sports coupes and are hardly unique to the Prelude, however).  The rear seats are uncomfortable if you're over five feet tall, but are adequate for short trips.  
 
Coupes tend to have small trunks, and the Prelude is further hampered by not having a hatch back.  The rear seats do fold down, however, which gives you more room.  The trunk is shallow, maybe 1 1/2' at most, so it won't hold very large items, but is more than adequate for trips to Walmart and the grocery store.

The stock sound system is one of the better factory systems available.  The speakers utilize a system called AFBS (Active FeedBack System).  Each of the two rear speakers has a microphone under it, and these microphones are used to listen for distortion and the AFBS sends an out of phase signal to nullify the sound.  The CD player hasn't skipped on me yet, but I haven't taken the car over any bumpy roads.

Performance wise, this car is great.  60 MPH comes in around 7 seconds, and this car goes into triple digit speeds without breaking a sweat.  Granted, you won't be beating any V8's, but for normal driving this car performance and agility are very useful.  There's a very active aftermarket for these cars, and if you feel the need for speed you can slap a turbocharger and a few engine mods on.
