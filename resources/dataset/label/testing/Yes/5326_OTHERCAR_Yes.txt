            Wow, all of the Epinion people hit the nail right on the head. The Honda Accord is an incredibly solid car in every way.  First, the Accord has a rather simple styling that can appeal to everyone, as it combines the classy profile of expensive luxury sedans with the practical, yet rakish and sporty feel of smaller sports cars.  

The 1998 EX is a might fine car, and it really grabs attention with the optional spoiler and alloy wheels.  Mechanically, the Accord, like other Hondas, is built like a tank. You could drive this to the end of the Earth and back and not sense any problems. A relative of mine has a 1986 Accord with well over 300,000 miles on it and he STILL trusts it driving all over the country on trips.  

The Accord has got to be the most reliable car on the road today, mechanically, and you can get as many &quot;bells and whistles&quot; on it as you want, adding some luxury to the practical family car. CD player, Power everything, roomy trunk, comfortable seats, the Accord truly has it all. I STRONGLY suggest getting an Accord if you want a stylish car that will last forever with proper upkeep, and has phenomenal resale value. BUY ONE NOW!!<br><br>
