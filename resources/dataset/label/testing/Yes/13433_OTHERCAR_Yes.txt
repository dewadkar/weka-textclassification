              After a disheartening experience with my first car, an '85 Toyota MR2, I went searching for bigger and better.(Aren't we all, ladies?) I had been driving a company Ford Explorer and was considering buying one until I sat my derriere in the seat of my new (to me) 1996 Chevrolet Blazer. This lovely snow white beast called out to me with it's $1,500 price tag. I lucked into an LT version with leather power seats, temperature and directional display, CD player, roof rack, 4 wheel drive, and a towing package, all of which have come in handy. Other features I love include the split rear seat, which allows me to carry long items and still keep my two year old buckled safely in the back seat where he belongs, the hatch back/tailgate type back opening which not only allows easy access to the cargo area, but also creates a convenient seat for outdoor events, and the sleek interior styling and roominess that I just haven't found in comparable SUV's. 
   The one thing I would change is accessibility of the spare tire, as everyone knows that you only get flats in the dark, in the rain , and on the side of a highway. I'd like to see a spare tire accessible via wheel well from the interior cargo bay.
  All in all, an amazing vehicle that I intend to drive for many years, if I can stop backing into trees.
