            I bought this camera just two days ago because I am going on vacation in two weeks and I needed a good, compact, light weight, with good picture quality, and not too expensive digital camera; thats how I stumbled upon this Olympus Camedia C-4000 Zoom Digital Camera. Now I have only used it for two days and I am already begining to fall in love with it. But just for new buyers, buy 128MB smartmedia memory card(s) with your camera because they only include a 16MB one (only takes about 24 shots). 

Features: 
--------- 

USB Connection 
SmartMedia Memory Card Compatible 
4.1 Mega Pixel Resolution 
3X Optical Zoom 
10X Digital Zoom 
Video Out 
PC and MAC Compatible 
Optical Viewfinder and LCD Display 
QuickTime Movie Recording 
4 x AA Battery or 2 x CR-V3 Lithium Battery Packs 
JPEG and TIFF Picture Formats 

Picture Quality: 
---------------- 

The picture quality is very sharp and clear. You will definitely not be disappointed with the print quality if you have a good printer. Resolutions include: 3200x2400, 2288x1712, 2048x1536, 1600x1200, and 1280x960. 

Video Quality: 
-------------- 

Although there is no audio support, video resolutions are available in QuickTime Motion JPEG format and the resolutions include: 320x240, 160x120. This camera takes the best video that I have seen among some of the Digital Camera. You won't be dissapointed by the results. 

Battery: 
-------- 

This digital camera comes with two CR-V3 lithium battery packs and can also be used with 4 AA batteries which allow for about 3 hours or 600-700 shots. The battery life is great if yo! u do not use the LCD monitor that much, but if you are like me and use the LCD a lot then battery life is of concern. There is no battery charger included so you might want to include this in your purchase also. 

Comfort and handling: 
--------------------- 

This camera fits very nicely in your hands and seem to just be an extention to you arms. The buttons seem to be placed in comfortable locations so you won't get cramps in your fingers while taking a lot of pictures. 

Usage: (updated: 5/14/2003) 

After using this camera for two weeks, I am falling in love with it. The picture are turning out brilliantly and the camera is performing outstandingly. Even if I don't use the flash in a dark room, it automatically lights the picture, but sometimes its a little blurly without the flash. The video clips are good quality. With the starter 16MB SmartMedia card I can take about 16 picture that are high quality and about 32 picture with lower quality. The two CR-V3 lithium battery packs lasted for over 330 pictures with and without flash. When reviewing the pictures the only thing that is unusual is the placement of the navigation arrow keys. It would be better if it was where your thumb is when you hold the camera. 

Conclusion: 
----------- 

This is a great camera to invest your money into; it will be around for some time. It will allow you to share the greatest moments of your life with your loved ones. At the same time, if you want to take pictures for your business and your postings on ebay.com, you will be able to do all of that and more. So good luck and enjoy.
