            This is the third Civic we've owned and are very pleased. Oil pan leaked early on but was taken care of by the dealer without any issues. The tail lights are slightly different on the EX than other models and I prefer them better. The ride is very comfortable considering the price. The car has been very reliable and I would buy a fourth  except the new ones have yet another bodystyle change which I don't care for. The acceleration is very nice, the VTEC engine really packs a punch. The trunk is pretty roomy. The EX also comes with a tweeter package which places small speakers next to the side mirrors on the doors, which makes a huge difference to the quality of the audio.
