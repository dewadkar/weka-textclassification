            I won't bore you with the details of the car.  Those can be found on their website or Kelly Blue Book.  What I will tell is how my almost year long experience has been with this car.  I've put just over 10,000 miles on it so far.

I bought this car back in June.  The main reason I bought it was the 10-year, 100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty (I upgraded the warranty from 5-year, 50,000 miles for an extra $20 month in my payments).  The warranty is transferable to the next owner... perfect if I decide to give it to my younger sister once she reaches college age or if I sell it I have a little more worth.  I have had the car almost a year and I have yet to have a need for the warranty.  Not once has this car had anything wrong other than a flat I had patched.

I live in Colorado.  This past fall I drove the car to Indiana straight in one day (17 hours), three days later I drove to South Carolina (10 hours), 5 days later back to Indiana, and 3 days after that back to Colorado.  It drove flawlessly.  Never did I feel it was going to break down or did it need a rest.  I put over 3000 miles on it in those two weeks and all it needed afterward was an oil change.  

The car gets good gas mileage.  I get around 28-30 mpg.  I usually have to fill the tank once every two weeks to get between home and work.  Nice if you are lazy like myself. :)

Nice speaker system, but the CD player itself could use a little help.  Very slim in the options there.  

I love the look of this car.  It reminds me of a SAAB hatchback.  I actually had several friends think at first it was a SAAB until they saw the Hyundai logo on it.

Since it is a hatchback, you have to compete for room in the back.  There's not much going on for leg room in the back... but what do I care, I'm the driver.  That also means that when everyone hops in someone's car to go somewhere, you get to save on gas because there is no way you can pack five 6' tall people in the car for each seat.  Someone else will have to do the driving.  

The car has nice pickup, but I would prefer more.  I'm one of those annoying people that likes to rabbit race to the next stoplight.  I can do it, but I find myself wishing I had more sometimes especially on interstates when I need to get around some grandma in my lane that doesn't realize the speed limit is only a suggestion!  

<b>Conclusion:</b>
Would I buy this car used or a new one?  How could I say NO?

I get great gas mileage, a reliable vehicle, and I look nice doing it.  Not to mention if this thing breaks down in the next 10 years, it gets fixed.  Bottom line:  Thank you, Hyundai!
