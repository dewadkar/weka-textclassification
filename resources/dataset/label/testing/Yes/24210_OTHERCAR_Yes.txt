            I have driven a Camaro from 1976 to 1985, a Firebird from 1985 to 1997, and have another Camaro from 1997 to present.  I love these cars.  If you buy a standard with posi-traction in the rear end, you will NEVER be stuck.  I have driven around 4 wheel drives in our Canadian winters, I kid you not(23 years of experience).  The sheer joy of driving one cannot readily be expressed in writing.  The only thing I hate about them is that after 12-13 years, they decide to &quot;retire&quot;.  Low maintenance, just keep up the regular oil changes &amp; grease jobs, and they'll purr along for you forever.  Anyone who loves to drive will truly enjoy these cars, you feel the road beneath your wheels, and with a 5/6 speed really experience driving.  The handling is incomparable as well.  Add a sun roof, and you've really got the &quot;wind in your hair&quot;.  They are so reliable, other than a fuel pump once, nothing else has ever gone wrong.  The only down sides are: older relatives find it hard to get in and out of the back seat, and you really must be careful what you drive over because they are so low.  My current Z28 is the lowest yet, which is great for handling, but you really must watch secondary/rural roads.  Both my previous cars were sold to people who lovingly restored them.  I recommend the 305/350 V8's for maximum performance.  Enjoy the experience!
