            This is a revision of a review I wrote over a year ago.
----------
Well, my Honda Accord lived a short life, until 2 nights ago I was rear ended by a Sheriff's deputy who was traveling at a very high speed. My car was flipped upside down and sent skidding down the road and into a ditch some 50 or 60 feet away.

I was wearing my seat belt and the only injury I suffered was a major cut to my forehead, which I think is a result of my head hitting either the sunroof or the rearview mirror. I don't think that I will ever know.

I was traveling at approximately 35 miles per hour on a dark 2-lane road when the office came charging up behind me, on the way to a call. The officer was traveling at a speed of well over 60-70 miles per hour, and was not able to swerve around me when he realized I had no shoulder to pull onto.

The Honda's trunk smashed in completely, and the impact was enough to lift the rear of the car into the air. Still pushing my car forward, I went into a ditch at an angle that caused one of the tires to catch and make my Accord flip over and slide down the road. All of the rear windows busted out and the front windshield shattered, but did not bust out.

I walked away from the accident with a bloody head, but at least I walked away. What's funny is I have more pain in my shoulder from the seat belt holding me in, than I do from the major laceration to my forehead that resulted in over 50 stitches. Without a doubt, my seatbelt saved my life, but I contribute a good bit of that to the design of the seats in my Honda. If it were not for the way they are constructed, my neck probably would have been broken or I would have at least suffered whiplash or some kind of concussion.

I had x-rays to my neck, back, shoulders, and head. Nothing was broken or even out of place. I would definitely buy another Honda Accord. It may seem like a small car, but it's one tough little machine.

Old review:

I bought a 99 Accord Coupe EX-LV back in April '99. It came equipped with leather interior, power everything, sunroof, cd player, spoiler, and front cover.

Before buying the Honda, I was seriously considering getting a Mazda Millenia. I was practically sold on the Mazda when, one night, I decided to test drive the new Honda's just to see what they were all about. Well, to make a long story short, I came back to the dealer the next morning and bought the Accord.

The car is exceptionally quiet. It handles very well, and the acceleration is equivalent to a Camaro (I checked the numbers).  It is very comfortable as well, and the driver's seat is fully motorized, which makes it easier to set it exactly as you like.

All in all, I am thoroughly impressed with my purchase. Honda has a very good reputation when it comes to quality and reliability, and that reputation speaks for itself through this Accord.
