            My friend recently purchased a new Honda Civic 4-door sedan.  Despite the patheticaly slow 4 cylinder engine's pickup, the vehicle isa very nice car.   The frame is even surprisingly durable for a small car.  He accidently backed into a much larger SUV at a high speed, and no apparent damage was left, pardon small paint scraps.  The vehicle was purchased due to the minute price tag, and the outer appearance.  The vehicle is comfortable to sit in, and it drives like most other inexpensive cars.  I would reccomend this car to anyone looking for a reliable durable car for any new driver. <br><br>
