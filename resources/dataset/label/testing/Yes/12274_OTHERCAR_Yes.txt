            I bought my 1992 Nissan Pickup in March 1992 for use as a pizza delivery truck.  Over the past nine years I have used it for this purpose and for hauling.  At this time it has 242,000 miles and is still going strong.

The truck is simple, with little to go wrong.  I have had to do little to this truck except routine upkeep.  I change the oil and filter every 3000 miles and it is good to go.  I have went through about 14 sets of brakes, but that is the pizza delivery.

On the repair side, I had to replace the starter at 150K ($89), the mass air flow sensor at 175K ($500), and the 5 speed transmission is worn and had to have the bearings replaced at 200K.  That's it as far as major repairs,  I would heartily recommend these trucks for anyone in the market.

One great advantage is the base 135 hp, 4 cyl engine.  It is much more powerful than the base engines in most similar trucks.

On the disadvantage side, it really can't handle a heavy load well.  It is rated for 1/2 ton and was really never meant to be a hard work truck.  If you are going to often haul heavy (over 500 lb.) loads I would recommend a full size American truck.
