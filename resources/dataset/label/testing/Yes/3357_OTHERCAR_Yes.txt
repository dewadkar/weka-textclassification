            I been waiting for almost a year to purchase my Nissan Pathfinder.  I wanted the LE, but I've been waiting quietly for the All-Mode 4x4 system to become available.  Once I knew they were available, I gave the dealer the keys to my old Ford Explorer, wrote the check, and drove off the lot with my new Pathfiner 3.5 LE.

The All-Mode 4x4 system is basically the system that is available in the Infiniti QX4.  It gives you not only the comfort of a full-time four wheel drive system, BUT, also the ability to drop the system into 4x4 low or 2WD (for you gas-misers out there).  Adding this system into a vehicle as car-like as a Pathfinder is a match made in heaven.  Add in that mouth watering 3.5, 240HP V-6, and I am downright speechless.  I am a big fan of luxo sedans, and the Pathfinder LE with Leather is literally a Maxima-class vehicle, with the confidence inducing traction of a 4x4.

Beyond the standard options of an LE, like limited slip differential, sunroof wind deflector, etc., I added the Leather Package.  I believe it is definitely worth the $1999. In addition to very comfortable, high quality leather seats, you'll get side-air bags, seat heaters, and power motors under both front seats - with the driver's getting two position memory.  For those of you looking at the Pathfinder SE, keep in mind that once you start adding on the options, you may be able to save a couple bucks by going with the already loaded LE.

Build quality and reliability has been wonderful.  So far in mixed driving, I am getting about 16-18 miles per gallon.

The sticker price of my Pathfinder was just a touch over $36K.  The dealer gave it to me for about half a percent over invoice.  That was the price he wrote on the little piece of paper, no haggling involved.  It actually through me for a loop, making me check my numbers, and wonder what was wrong as I came prepared to deal down from retail price...not just look at his offer and say "OK". Of course I had to say that his price was STILL too high, which gave me the opportunity to flex my haggling muscles a little further.  I also purchased a 6 year, 75,000 mile refundable warranty for $1,200.  If you don't use the last three years of the warranty, you get your $1,200 back. I thought it was a good deal.  One thing I thought was a little pricey was replacement/spare keys.  Because the keys have little chips in them that work to start the car, you can't get spares just anywhere.  The dealer will charge $70 per spare key beyond the two you get with the car.

I would definitely recommend this vehicle.  This replaced my 1997 Ford Explorer - and its in a whole different class.  You'll have a hard time remembering that you're driving a sport utility vehicle, and not a sport sedan.
