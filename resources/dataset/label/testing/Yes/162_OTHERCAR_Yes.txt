            When I decided to purchase a digital camera I went online & researched for 2 weeks for features, prices, opinions all over the internet.  I had to stay in the low-budget range but the Smile, Poloroid, Ixla, Afga were all greatly cheap with crappy quality.  This is no blockbuster but it's great for the price.  But if you're going to complain about petty things like battery usage, you haven't done your homework.  ALL digital cameras use up alkalines.  Here's what you need for the MX1200:  NiMh rechargeable batteries & charger (go to batteryville.com - great products, prices & customer service), larger SmartMedia card (I bought 32MB) & a FlashPath Floppy Disk Adapter so you won't kill yourself over enormous upload times (you can find both at buy.com for good prices), camera case b/c there's no lens cover & you don't want to risk damaging that. With most digital  cameras, you're going to have to buy these extras to get up to speed b/c they don't supply you with all you need right off the bat.  But with the flash, this camera takes awesome photos indoors, really, for 1.3 megapixels.  If you want to print them, you have to set it on BEST, otherwise you'll hate life. But for email & websites, Normal setting is adequate.  Very easy to pick up and use - I shot my first photos right out of the box, without reading the owner's manual.  If you keep it all in perspective, the MX1200 is a perfect camera for this price range!
