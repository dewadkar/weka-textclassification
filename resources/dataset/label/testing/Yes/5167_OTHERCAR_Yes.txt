            The Dodge Ram Dakota I s one of the better mid-size trucks out on the market today. It comes with a full line different features. 
The thing I like most about any truck is the 4x4 transmission, and in the Dodge Dakota the all wheel drive is supperb, the handling of the transion from 2x4 to 4x4 is so smoothe. Like a babies butt. any way the Dodge Dakota 4x4 is the best mid-size truck. If you dont go out and get one today you dont know what your missin' so dont waste any time make you trip down to your local Dodge dealer and price one up for yourself<br><br>
