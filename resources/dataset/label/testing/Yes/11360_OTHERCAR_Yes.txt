               When I first test drove the Dodge Caravan, my thoughts were immediately - WOW! No other minivan I had ever owned or had driven could compare to this Dodge. I just knew I had to have it. The first thing I noticed about this van was the double sliding back doors. Most people buy minivans because they want more space than they can get from a car. The problem with most vans is that even though you have space inside of the van, getting inside is still a problem because you have only one rear door. That is why the second rear door is such a convenience! 

   Once inside this van the first thing that you notice is the amount of space that you have throughout. The drivers and front passenger chairs are extremely comfortable and roomy. The console between these chairs has everything that you might possibly need or imagine! These little extras are really what makes you smile. For instance, there are cup holders that can be fitted to the size of your cup! Smart thinking, there! On our van we have a middle &quot;half-seat&quot; that fits two people. Inside these seats there are two pull down child safety seats that are built in. This delights me as a mom of three little one so much! You have the convenience of having the seas right there and if you don't need them, then the seats can be used normally. No lugging the baby's car seats in and out of the van. Their right there! The back seat is a full bench seat, which can seat three people with plenty of room for all. The luggage space in the rear is so big and roomy. No more trying to stuff all of your groceries into what seems like the &quot;leftover&quot; room of a van.
    Another great thing about the Dodge Caravan is all of the little extras. Individual climate controls - front and rear, the driver controls the opening of the back windows by using a button on the dashboard. Separate compartments under the front seats and between the console to store all the important stuff. All of these extras add up to make life on the road a little easier.
    The most important question when buying a new car or minivan is, &quot;How does it drive?&quot;. When talking about the Dodge Caravan, the answer is...Heavenly! My greatest concern when purchasing a van was that I didn't want it to drive like a big, clunky, oversized machine. Instead, the Dodge Caravan drove better than most smaller cars I had driven before. It is so easy to handle on the road. It has great take off speed and you could stop it on a dime if necessary. It is so easy to handle and to maneuver, even easy to parallel park.
    I would recommend this van over any others out there in the market today. In it's price range it is a great bargain. It looks stylish and anyone could drive it from soccer moms to single guys. Anyone who would like more space would love this van!
