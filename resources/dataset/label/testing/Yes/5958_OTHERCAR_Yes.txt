            I purchased my NSX new back in April 1991, the first model year.  After approximately 90,000 miles of daily driving and a few long trips, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, though I'm not sure (like many expensive car purchases) that it was the wisest financial decision to make.

The NSX looks and drives like an exotic sports car.  Even after more than 10 years, it still turns heads and evokes comparisons to sports cars much more expensive.  And unlike some of that expensive brethren, the NSX is extremely reliable -- I have never once been stranded -- it's "Ferrari" on the outside but "Honda" on the inside.

The car handles great and feels fast, even now.  One of the things that sold me on it was that it drives like a slot car, but it also is very comfortable to ride in.  I have driven across country and the seats/ride are very comfortable compared to some sports car alternatives and their performance suspensions.

The appearance has held up well.  The car's finish looks good, though the front has been pretty nicked up by road debris after 10+ years.  The all-aluminum body also seemed to pay off when my car got stuck in two pretty-severe hail storms and I emerged unscathed (I wasn't sure that would be the case sitting inside the car during those storms).

For the first 5 years/50K miles, the car was essentially problem free, and relatively inexpensive to maintain.  Other than oil changes, scheduled maintenance, and periodic tire replacements, there were no major expenses.  I've followed manufacturer's recommendations and used only premium unleaded fuel, so I can't tell you whether you can sneak buy with lower octane (haven't wanted to risk it). 

The NSX does go through tires (more or less depending on your driving habits) -- I have generally gotten about 10K miles on rear tires and 25K or so on front tires (I've kept the stock Yokohama A-022 tires throughout).  I don't mind tire wear since it is a part of keeping your car well adhered to the road service (beats sliding out of control), but it is an expense to be budgeted for.

The tires are 205/50ZR15 on the front and 225/50ZR16 on the rear -- unusual sizes, so you may not be able to find replacements at Sam's Club or other tire discounters.  One other important note about the stock tires -- they are asymmetric, so each tire (right front, left front, right rear, left rear) are different!  The good news is no tire rotation is needed (nor possible); bad news is that if you get a flat, you can't just replace with any one of your old tires -- you need the exact one -- so you would have to have four full-size spares lying in your garage!).

Mechanically, I've replaced the clutch (expensive) and the timing belt (also very expensive), but those were both after 50K miles (timing belt was after 10 years/75K miles), so these didn't seem particularly unreasonable.  The other major expense after a decade was replacing the air conditioning system as the refrigerant needed replacing and I needed to upgrade the system to take 134A refrigerant (used in all post-1994 cars) -- OUCH!  If I hadn't lived in the south, maybe I would have tried to tough it out. 

Window clips -- I've had some problems with window clips and windows falling out/into the door frame and breaking.  I lost both passenger and driver windows that way (more scary than anything else), but they were fine after replacing the clips.  Acura picked up the cost, but I there was never an official recall that I was aware of (they replaced under "goodwill").

Bose Audio System -- The Bose audio system that came stock with the car (and in others including Cadillacs) sounds great, but is prone to failure.  Instead of a central amplifier driving speakers, each speaker is individually amplified, and these amplifiers have a tendency to fail with time.  When they do, you'll know it (you get loud random noise that will, left unattended, damage the speakers).  To replace, you have to remove the speaker/amp, replace/repair the speaker/amp, and re-install it.  Changing to a more conventional system requires extensive rewiring/replacement, so you need to be aware of this if you are an audiophile.  There is a shop in Dallas that repairs/renovates these speaker/amps at a price far lower than replacement (you should be able too find them with an internet search on "Acura NSX speaker replacement")

Wear and tear.  There are some areas of the seats where the leather seams have come unsewn and unsightly white inside is visible.  It hasn't bothered me enough to pay the money to repair.  The struts in the trunk and engine compartment need replacing (fair, but haven't gotten around to it).

Overall, I've been pleased with the Acura service that I've received in four different locations over the life of my car.  They've been thorough and fair and haven't excessively gouged me on repair/maintenance costs.

I hope this helps anyone who's thinking of buying one or just curious.
