            i didn't want this car in the first place, but my dad insisted that my old car could not make the trip back and forth to college. after a while it grew on me. 

it's a peppy little car that handles easily. the back seat is a little small, but the trunk is big. i would not recommend this car to anyone who is tall because you will be a bit squished while driving. the seats are uncomfortable after about 2 hrs of driving, especially the passenger seat. 
it's pretty efficient with gas; i get about 250-260 miles per tank. the tiburon handles pretty well in the rain. i have taken it to get regularly scheduled tune-ups &amp; have had no problems with the tiburon. i drive like a maniac at times so it has to keep up with me. 

my model came with an 8 speaker stereo standard. it doesn't have a cd player, but it does have a tape player. this sound is nice &amp; crisp. i would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an affordable car that is also kind of sporty<br><br>
