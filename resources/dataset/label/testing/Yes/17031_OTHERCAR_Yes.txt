            My husband and I bought our 4 wheel drive Durango while living in Rochester, Indiana.  We thought it would be great for getting around in all that winter snow that graces northern Indiana.  After owning our Durango for 5 months, we decided to move to Florida.  We both wondered many times why we would even want a Durango in Florida.

Once we were in Florida we had thought about trading in the Durango for a more gas economical vehicle.  Gas mileage is the only downfall of the Durango that I can come up with. However, we knew the gas consumption when we bought the vehicle so, it came as no surprise.

One day shortly after arriving at our new home we decided to take a trip to the beach.  At this particular beach we were allowed to drive on the actual beach and park.  As the day wore on, many beach visitors became stuck in the dry, loose sand.  Their vehicles were virtually buried.  I was able to help pull these vehicles out of the sand with the towing hitch (which came on the Durango).  

At one point I became stuck in the sand also.  I just put it in 4 wheel drive and drove out like there was no sand at all.  I decided at that point I would not trade in my Durango.

I also love the feeling of safety while driving the Durango.  Most of all, feel that my kids are safe in while they are in it.  When I trade it in for a new vehicle, I will trade it in on a NEW Durango.  I would recommend that anyone get a Durango who can afford a low gas mileage vehicle.  It isn't just for men who want a truck.  It isn't just for a family vehicle and.... it isn't just for snow anymore.  <br><br>
