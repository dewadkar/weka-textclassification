                <b>W</b>ith the most recent boom in upscale sport-utility vehicles, FOMOCO decided it wanted a slice of the proverbial 'pie'. Enter the Lincoln Navigator, this is a F-series based off-roader with a powerful DOHC 5.4 liter 300 horsepower V8 engine and plenty of luxury interior appointments.(This SUV in 1998 only had 230 hp, the extra power was welcomed with open arms.)


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   <b>S</b>itting in the Navigator is much like getting behind the wheel of a Lincoln Town Car, though the high driving position offers a better view of the road. Off the highway the Navigator is surprisingly capable, mind you I only took  my test 2002 Navigator to the Avenue Of The Giants river bar, but hey it was still 'off road', and didn't even come close to getting stuck. Select 'low range 4-wheel drive' and the vehicle rises an inch higher than speeds under 25 MPH, helping it clear difficult obstacles. On the freeway, the Navigator is relaxing to drive, being very comfortable, and very refined. The Navigator not only has one of the highest towing capacities in its class, but one of the highest of all off roaders, it can tow up to 8,000 lbs; a vehicle 'Fat Ba*tard' from the hit movie 'Auston Powers' would appreciate.

        The <b>Navigator</b> comes with a high-tech 5.4 liter V8, in-fact all the Navigators use the 5.4 liter DOHC 300 horsepower engine. This engine not only comes with more power than a Mustang GT, and almost as much power as a Camaro Z28, it also comes with a massive 355 lb-ft of torque, this is more torque than I have ever seen with a relatively small 5.4 liter engine. These engine's are all matched with a smooth 4-speed automatic which gives this vehicle a 17 MPG freeway EPA.

     <b>Suspension:</b> The body may look a little different  from the Ford Expedition, but the floorpan and the running gear are shared and can be traced back to the F150 pickup. The Navigator is way more sophisticated however. There is a choice of 4-wheel or 2-wheel drive. The Four wheel drive has air shocks and springs to give a softer ride.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> of the Navigator is class leading. Amenities are everywhere and the ergonomics are right on target for a SUV boasting this price. The leather seats are heated and air conditioned, along with lumbar supports and anything your fanny desires. These seats are extremely comfortable, you'll just have to sit in them yourself to see just how comfortable they really are. Another feature that I found accommodating is the easy access to the HVAC controls and all the gadgetry offered in the Navigator.  Despite having more than enough amenities for even the most picky consumer, each device is very easy to use, and is in reach of the driver.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

  The <b>exterior</b> looks a little like the Expedition, but the Navigator is much more bold, with its traditional Lincoln grille, and its powerful stance, there is no confusing the Navigator with its less attractive brother.

     <b>A</b>lthough a two wheel drive version is available, the four wheel drive model is the better choice. It costs just over 3,000 more (around $44,000), but it is far more tractable and easier to drive. Off road, the 4-WD is known to handle itself in any sort of terrain.

     Since the introduction of the Navigator in 1998, its been a reliable sport utility all its owners can rely on. Consumer Reports has more info <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b> or any other reliable source should confirm this. 


<i>Conclusion:</i>


If you like the luxury of a Town Car, but also want the luxury of 4 wheel drive, then the Navigator offers an extreme amount of value. While not exactly cheap, the Navigator is also a vehicle that is not so expensive that one won't be able to take it off road.

Looking for an equally refined SUV that costs almost $13,000 less? You may want to check out <b> <a href="/content_96243453572"> my review on the 2003 Honda Pilot.</a> </b>
