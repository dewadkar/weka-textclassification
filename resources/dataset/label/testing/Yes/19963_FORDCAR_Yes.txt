            I purchased my 1990 Ford Taurus two years ago for $750. The previous owners dumped over $5000 into this vehicle in the last 3 years. I have the bills to back their claim. I figured that after spending this amount of money in a relatively short time frame this should be a good buy. I must say that it was. I have put 20k on the car in the last year and we as a family have started leaving the 1996 Windstar at home and using the Taurus. The reason, much better fuel economy in the Taurus. 

I have been reading quite a bit of information on the first generation Taurus. The AXOD transmissions used in these cars are prone to failure. So much so that Ford has updated many internal parts to the transmission. How do I know this? My transmission went. It cost $1750 to rebuild and now the car runs perfectly, once again.   <br><br>
