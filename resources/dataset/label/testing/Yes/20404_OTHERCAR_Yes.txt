            INTRO
I had a VW Beetle prior to owning this car.  However, I had 3 accidents in the Beetle (all caused by the other driver) and decided that maybe a black Beetle wasn't for me.  So I traded it in for a 2001 Golf TDI.  I'd never had a diesel engine before (nor turbo) but was so happy with the test drive I ended up getting more than I bargained for.

THE CAR WAS GREAT IN FLORIDA
I originally bought the car in Florida.  However, I was planning to take it with me to art school in New Mexico and once I got there I realized it was a mistake.  The roads in New Mexico are crap, if there's a road at all.  There are a lot of dirt roads too and the Golf has low ground clearance.  I  am constantly scraping bottom no matter how slowly I drive or how hard I try to stay away from bad dirt roads.  They are simply unavoidable.  

Because of this I've had to replace 3 parts of my mudguard and it hasn't been cheap.  However to look at the parts they look like very cheap black plastic.  When I complained to VW about it, they said that the car being low to the ground was not a defect, rather a difference in design and would not let me use my warranty to fix those parts.

My other complaint is that the door lock broke (???) and because it is an electrical problem it will cost 275  to fix.  What happens is the door suddenly thinks it's open and the lights go on and the bell starts ringing.  I've taken to just unlocking and locking the doors whenever that happens and that seems to stop the madness.    

SO NOW WHAT
I am looking to trade in this car for another Beetle (blue perhaps) after I finish paying off this car.  It's a wonderful car if you live in the city but if you live on the outskirts, avoid this car.  By the way, I drove the Beetle in the backwoods of Georgia and never had this problem with the bottom scraping.  I don't think it's all VW cars, just the Golf in particular.
