              My family bought a '94 Honda Passport because we were looking for a car capable of hauling a good lot of supplies.  That's exactly what we got.  Driving the Passport is great, it has a suspension which rivals that of the more expensive SUV's in the price range, and its great to trust a car not to break down.  Honda's engine construction is centered around efficiency, not necesarily only gas mileage, also reliability requirements, and power.  The Passport doesn't have a tone of power, but it has enough for light jobs, for instance helping someone who's non 4x4 car is stuck in mud or snow.  The car proved more than useful, as in the same 4 months we bought it, there was a blizzard, and we moved.  The car handles snow great, it can track up snowy hills with ease.  It helped us fix up our house while we were moving because it enabled us to haul wood (to rebuild a fence), and a new lawnmower we bought fit easily in the back.  If you are concerned there may not be enough room, it is easy to fold down the back seat and all of a sudden you have enough storage capacity to fit almost anything, from mulch, to go-karts.<br><br>
