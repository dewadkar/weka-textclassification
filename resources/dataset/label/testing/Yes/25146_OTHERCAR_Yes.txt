            I really didn't intend to buy any digital camera at all.  My wife and I take forever to use up a roll of film, so why spend a significant sum of money to get a digital camera when we hardly use the conventional type?  Well, after seeing my sister's digital (a Canon powershot 20), she thought it might be nice to have one of our own because she does a lot of painting and wanted to photograph her artwork.

Still, a digital camera was not considered a near-term acquisition for us, mainly because of the cost.  

Then one evening we were having dinner with another couple and the husband mentioned this website called "gotapex.com" which has a daily listing of web bargains.  So he got me started on checking out the site every day to see what looked good.  And one day, there was a posting about digital cameras being on sale at Dell.com.  After thinking about it a bit, I figured this would make a nice Christmas present for my wife, and would certainly be a surprise.

After doing a lot of extensive research reading consumer and professional opinions, plus taking into account the unusual size of the s110, I placed my order on Dell.com.  Now, I am far from an expert on cameras so I don't think actually looking at the camera or trying it out in person would have made a difference.  I put a lot of weight into what actual users have to say about something, much more than an oft-biased salesperson.  I had narrowed the choice down to either the Canon or the competing Nikon 2.1 Coolpix.  The Canon won out based on reviewer picture quality comments plus the fact that the Canon seemed sturdier with its metal case, versus the Nikon's plastic housing.

How is it?  Well, we take a whole lot more pictures now than before!  It is so much easier for us lazy types to take pictures that are instantly available to see, plus download onto the computer.  No more waiting for developing time, no more buying film!  As for picture quality, speaking as a layman, I find it better than anything I've ever used.  Colors are accurate and detail is sharp.  Plus, mistakes can be deleted and for the pictures that do get saved, I can make adjustments to them using imaging software (Photoimpact 6, which is a great product).  Just the convenience alone is worth a great deal!

I've read differing opinions as to the usefulness of the manual that comes with the camera.  In my opinion, the manual is straightforward, easy to follow, and gives you the information you need.  I was initially overwhelmed by all the settings and controls but there is a logic to them and frankly, I don't use them all and the ones I do use, they quickly become ingrained.  I want to point out that due to the small size of the camera (it can hide behind a credit card), the controls are necessarily spaced fairly close to each other and you have to be careful not to press the wrong button.

I just received the "rebate" pack consisting of a rechargeable lithium battery, 16MB compact flash card, and a sling bag.  It's nice to have a spare battery because ours seems not to last that long.  I think that's due in part to keeping the camera on too long between shots, plus using the lcd to view and review pictures.  The 8MB card that comes with the camera is way too small, and the 16MB is also small but at least it represents extra storage.  I purchased a 128MB SanDisk flash to add to the present, along with their USB card reader.  I would highly recommend both of these things, seeing as how memory is relatively cheap now ($60 for the 128MB at Costco), and the USB reader saves camera battery power.  As for the sling bag, it's nice to have.  The quality is very good.

Other stuff: the camera has a nice, solid, quality feel to it.  Everyone who sees it finds it fascinating just on looks alone, and then they get sold on the ease and convenience of having a digital camera.  I bought a very nice hard case at REI for about $22 (also part of the Christmas present); it fits very snugly and offers much more protection than a soft case.  It's also a lot cheaper than buying a case from Canon!

Complaints: I already mentioned the small 8MB flash card.  It would be nice if Canon supplied an ac adapter, but it isn't a deal breaker.  There aren't any bargains on the adapter either, since it is proprietary and no one offers any worthwhile discounts on it, even on E-Bay. It would be nice to have an adapter but we get along fine without it.  

Neutral: We haven't used the software that came with the camera, so we have no comments.  It's loaded on the computer, however, and everything installed very smoothly under Windows 98 SE.

Summary: this is a wonderful little camera that takes excellent pictures.  It is easy to use and sooo convenient!  We are very, very glad to have it!  My wife says this was a much better choice than that steam cleaner she was talking about!  While it was way more than I was initially planning on spending, the expenditure was absolutely worthwhile.  No regrets!

Price paid:  $339.10 including shipping.  Camera was listed for $399, I got 10% off plus used a $20 coupon code listed at gotapex.com, took advantage of Dell's free shipping offer, and paid no sales tax.  That was the best deal I could find, including ones offered by less reputable merchants.
