            The summer after I graduated, right before I left for college, I was forced to sell my trusty 89 Dodge Dakota 4x4 because it was pushing 200,000 miles and I didn't know how many trips to college and back it could make.  I needed an inexpensive car that wouldn't empty my wallet in garage expenses.  I also required that it be dependable on the highway and be able to accelerate well at high speeds *for passing only, of course.*  A friend I worked with sold me her Mazda 626GT.  

I knew this car would be mine as soon as I sat in it.  It was wonderful.  Being 6' tall and a large build, I don't fit well into small cars, but I found that if I put the drivers seat in the furthest position back, it was way too far for me to reach the pedals comfortably.  The seats are comfortable enough for long trips and the car will seat 4 real people and one miniature person.  My model being a hatchback provided plenty of trunk space and if it isn't enough, I can always fold the rear seats down for a quite a bit of cargo area.

I found most of the internal electronics a little underpowered.  The windows go down slowly, and the drivers side makes an annoying squeaking sound as it goes down.  The moonroof is also rather lethargic, as are the power seatbelts.  There have been quite a few times that I was in a hurry getting in or out of the car and I was attacked by the power seatbelts.  Other than that, my only complaint about the electronics, was the stereo, which I replaced with a Panasonic CD player (I should write a review on that too!).  The cassette player does not pick up radio signals with any authority and the speakers had all been blown prior to my buying the car.

My favorite part of the car:  the mechanics of it.  At first glance of the car, I wanted it because it had four doors, looked good and ran.  It wasn't until I test drove it that I noticed what the GT badging stood for.  Nowhere on the car is the word turbo written, but its there, and... WOW!  The first time I hit the gas, my head hit the headrest.  The acceleration is incredible!  I would guess the 0-60 to be under 8 seconds, I have not timed it yet.  Some other benefits to the GT package is the stiffer suspension, beefed up drivetrain, and all wheel disc brakes.  Overall handling is superb, and it is definitely happy at highway speeds.  

When my mother saw it she said "Its a Granny-Mobile."  I wasn't going to correct her, I don't want her to worry.  :) The Mazda 626 is a solid dependable car; the GT is for people who want a solid dependable car, and want a car that's a sheer joy to drive.
