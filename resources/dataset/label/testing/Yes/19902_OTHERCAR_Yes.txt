            Ok guys! Here's the skinny on what SUV to buy for the new Millennium.
The 2000 Montero Sport! I'm a big time shopper, researcher and tough critic. After years of loving my 94 Mitsubishi Diamante, I wanted something a little less &quot;sedan&quot; and more fun. The great thing about the Montero Sport is that you don't give up much luxury and certainly no style to find fun and utility.

I have been very happily driving my 2000 Montero Sport Limited for 3,000 miles now, and it's the best money I've ever spent on an auto. If you need a little more &quot;get up and go&quot;, I would advise you to splurge for the Limited model which comes standard with a 3.5 liter V6 offering 210 horsepower (I'm not sure what all those horses really mean...but it moves very nicely). My old Diamante had the same engine and led me 105,000 miles without any major problem. The same can be said of all the interior gadgetry and paint. Under rated Mitsubishi makes some solid and stylish vehicles.

Then there's the fun factor. The ride is tall and grounded, aggressive and sure footed. There's lots of room for trips and sports gear too. Not to mention a babe factor of at least 9.7. What are you waiting for! 

Here's a real big tip too!!!!! Get a price quote online from CARS.COM!!!
I saved about $3k off sticker by doing this and it made the sales process easy and to the point. <br><br>
