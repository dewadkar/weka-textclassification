            This review is perhaps unique in that I am a Canadian reviewer and purchased a used 2003 Accord LXG that is 10 months old and has seen 19000KM (that's 12K miles to you) of the Great White North(tm).

The car has apparently held up well to our extremely harsh winter of 2002/03 and I'm impressed with the fit, finish and refinement of my new ride.

Though it has received mixed reviews, I find the Accord styling to be unique and refreshing. It's clearly a Honda from the front and the look supports my contention that Honda's design is evolutionary not revolutionary as is the case with some domestic models such as the Intrepid. A byproduct of this fact (in my opinion) is that you can drive an older Honda longer than you can a similarly vintage domestic car.

The interior has a velour-like finish which seems incongruous to today's preference for polished aluminum, wood and leather automobile accoutrements. But it is soft and comfortable, perhaps designed to evoke the cozy, peaceful feeling of a favorite pair of pajamas. Maybe you "wear" an Accord, not sit in it? Presumably it will wear as well as the synthetic feeling cloth interior of my former vehicles.

Fuel economy in 50%/50% city/rural road driving is about 8 litres/100KM. That's roughly 60 miles for 2 gallons of gas, or 30MPG at the speed limit. Driven harder (quicker acceleration, higher speeds) you will undoubtedly see a lower value. Nonetheless, 25-30+ MPG is pretty darn good fuel economy, and the environment will appreciate your modest attempt to respect it.

There are no odd noises, rattles, squeaks or unexpected sounds emanating from inside or outside of the car. This is a good thing and quite reassuring. (For comparison sake, my late model GM car had minor, but irritating rattles at 15000KM).

One thing that requires some investigation, however, is the car's penchant to vibrate when idling, if the cabin fan is on. Note that this isn't the AC system, but just having the dial turned on to the lowest speed. The cause seems to be that having the interior cabin fan on means that an engine fan also runs for 20-30 seconds every few minutes. That engine fan drops RPMs down just enough to cause a rough idle and hence the vibration. Needless to say, someone at the dealership can play around to see if they can identify a cause and fix, or at least validate my observation.

Compared to a late model 6 cylinder domestic that I've been driving for a few years, the Accord is a nicer car. Interior room is about the same, power is roughly equal (though the low end grunt of a 6 is clearly not there), and the ride is firmer and more inspiring. The domestic had just as smooth a transmission and was entirely reliable.

I see the decision to buy a Honda or Toyota over a domestic as coming down to "pay up front, or on the back end". A used domestic is substantially less money than a used Honda Accord or Toyota Camary. But the depreciation on the former means that the money you saved when you bought it, you lose when you sell it.
