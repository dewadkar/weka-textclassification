            I purchased this 1995 Altima in March of 1996 mainly because my husband worked for Nissan at the time and recommended it.  

I had never had a dependable car and was hoping for the best. Well I got it with the Altima. When I purchased it the car had 19,000 miles on it as of today it has 147,000 and is running just as good as the day I purchased it used. My ride is still smooth it still has good power and everything is in working condition. Hats off to Nissan for this one.

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a compact that packs a wallop. You won't be sorry and it's good on gas, that really counts these days. I also has a hint of luxury.

However if you are looking for a luxury car to flys down the freeway 90 miles per hour is a gas guzzler and has very expensive upkeep this car is not for you.  <br><br>
