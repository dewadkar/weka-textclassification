            What is the difference between a porcupine and a BMW? On a porcupine, the pricks on the outside.  No, I love the BMW.  The new 3 series are magnificent!  The 328, in my opinion, is a waste.  It is great, don't get me wrong.  But, for the money and the difference in engines, stick with the 323.  It is a beautiful piece of German manufacturing.  

The 323 is a quick, tight car.  With the Harmon Kardon stereo, it kicks ass.  Stick with the leatherette interior.  It cleans up and lasts longer than the leather - looks nearly the same.  I am just not sure what to say, other than it is great.  I am just impressed.  It has enough room for everyone (if your backseat riders are midgets).  No, it is great.  I love it.  So, what are you going to do after reading my article?  Go buy a 323.  If you can't afford one, prostitute yourself for a lil while.  They are worth it, and not too expensive.  So, go shopping!!!

PS -  They have magnificent warranties!!!<br><br>
