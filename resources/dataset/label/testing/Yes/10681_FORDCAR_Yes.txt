            Recently, I rented a fully-equipped 2001 Ford Explorer XLT while on vacation. It was a great-looking vehicle, but there were just too many little things I didn't care for.

After sitting in the driver's seat and adjusting it with the power adjustment, I went to buckle my seat belt. For some reason I just couldn't hit the hole for the seat belt. It seemed as though the clasp was underneath me. OK, for the first time maybe it was just me. Over several days I watched as others got in the passenger seat and noticed they all had the same problem with the seat belt.

Out on the interstate I was impressed with the smooth ride. The steering, however, was a bit too responsive for speeds of 70 mph. Once, I had to make an evasive move to avoid another vehicle coming into my lane. The vehicle seemed to be at the brink of fish-tailing with just one small, quick move. I drive 800+ miles per week in a GMC van and always feel I am in total command of the vehicle. After driving over 1000 miles in similar driving conditions in the Explorer, I never felt in total control of the vehicle.

The headlights and fog lights really light up the road well. They seemed to be a bit too bright for some on-comers as I had my share of folks flashing their lights at me.

I would recommend this vehicle to someone who mostly travels around town. The poor handling at high speeds seems much too dangerous for my comfort. The next time I need a rental, I think I'm going back to the Taurus...a great-handling automobile!<br><br>
