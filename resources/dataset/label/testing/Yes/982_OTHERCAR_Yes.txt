            The Concept

The Matrix is a wonderful blend of an SUV, family wagon, and sports car. I was looking at everything from a RAV4 to an Altima. I couldn�t find something that would seat five and be utilitarian, fast and cool at the same time that was not �trucklike�. NO MINIVANS! Mazda Prot�g� was too small, Subaru Outback, Saturn�s wagon, and others looked too much like station wagons. We almost caved in and just bought an Altima for its sporty performance, passenger space, and looks. I was looking at Toyota�s website and saw the Matrix and decided to wait to see if it was what I wanted. Thankfully, in Feb. I found out the answer was� YES. Except for off-road capabilities, it did everything I wanted, and since off-roading was a low priority, it was almost no decision to buy the Matrix XRS.

SUV?
You sit high in the Matrix, like in the ECHO, (which I also own) the way you might in many SUVs or Vans. I feel like the car is under me and I control it rather than �laying down� in it like in most cars. The roofline bubbles up quite high so there is little ducking or crunching to get in and out. The high ceiling gives the interior a spacious feel also. Both rear seats fold down very simply and flat to match the rear storage area to create a hard plastic �bed� with movable tie down eyes in tracks to secure cargo. It�s a very practical, useable cargo area with several covered compartments for tools, umbrellas, whatever. The ceiling height also adds to the size of the cargo area. Even the �trunk� where the spare is, under the cargo bed has nooks all around the spare for storage. Better yet, they could have put the spare under the car on a pulley like a pickup, oh well. Unlike an SUV, it has low-profile performance tires, and with the sports girding around the bottom doesn�t offer much clearance for off-roading. Of course how many SUV�s in the USA have ever seen a dirt road?

Sports car
I initially drove the XR version with a 1.8 liter VVTi, 140 HP 4sp automatic. I was unimpressed, it drove sluggishly and you had to push the petal to the floor to get any speed going. I decided to find an XRS with the 1.8 liter VVTLi, 180 HP with a six speed manual transmission. This drive train comes straight from the Celica GTS, which I had driven and was impressed with. I called several dealers and found an XRS and wow! The car performed just like its brother the Celica. This drive train is not like some other sports cars It�s meant to be revved highly to get its power, and does it! You feel the powerband at about 6.5 K in each gear and by the time you shift to 3rd, you should be traveling at 45-50 MPH. You get the picture? Low end torque for pulling things, and quiet performance? No. The performance exhaust is rather loud at high revs and it sounds like a Muscle Car. Some will find it cool, it could annoy others. If you drive moderately and shift at 3000 RPM the engine/exhaust is relatively quiet and the car performs like a �regular station wagon I suppose. If you want to show off, rev it to 7000 RPM and tell passengers to HOLD ON.

The dash, and general look of the interior, says, sports car, all the way. There is a cluster, behind the wheel, 4 cylinders trimmed in �chrome� with illuminated red gauges. Some found them hard to see. At first, I too, was put off by them. Now I am enjoying them more and more. There are other �chrome� accents around the interior also. The �short throw� shifter is leather and chrome and mounted on the dash and is very nice. It shifts smoothly. Annoying however is reverse, it�s to the left, which is OK with a six speed, but it beeps like a dump truck inside in reverse, bad idea. The steering wheel is slightly slippery and could have been a bit thicker, but looks sharp and leather covered, with a prominent Toyota logo in chrome. The XRS model comes with 17� wheels, wide performance tires, a sport suspension, and 4 wheel disc brakes. It handles very nimbly, holds in curves well, no shake or body roll, stops very quickly, and turns in a tight 32� turning radius.

Family wagon
The Matrix is rather roomy, a bit narrower and shorter passenger area than Accord, Camry, and Altima, but only by two inches or so in either direction. Ceiling height here again helps. The AC blows powerfully through metallic 360/ turning round vents. Storage up front is good with several compartments, a big glove box and under seat space also. They should have put a drawer under the passenger seat like they did in the ECHO. The rather large center console has an armrest that is a bit high, and has several storage compartments for CD�s, sunglasses, and such. The infamous 110AC power outlet and 12 volt outlets are below the climate controls. The 6 CD stereo is from AC Delco strangely enough. I guess a result from the deal to bring about the Pontiac Vibe. Of course, it�s one of the things I don�t like much, it�s only OK. It�s lit in red to match the gauges and looks cool, but it�s a bit complex and otherwise unimpressive. Door open wide and access and loading is no sweat. The full hatch opens as well as the glass piece independently. The exterior door handles are very solid. Buttons, levers, and switches seem durable. The rear cupholder spring- out set of �claws� is rather flimsy however. The front cup holders are Ill placed too closely together and too small.

Buying/Owning One
I went in to the dealer on a slow day and used a trade as barter to end up paying about $18.5 while giving them a car that would be hard-pressed to sell in the open market for $1,500. So, you could say I paid about $19.5. to 20,000 with tax, title, and registration. I think the XRS is a bargain when you consider the fact that it is a Toyota, after all. The drive train is a proven winner in the Celica GTS, and the Matrix Body, interior, and suspension, performs well, and is quite beautiful, well finished, and seems well made and durable. And good God, I almost paid that much for an Altima! Hopefully, gas mileage be on the high side of estimates 29/35, and I�m assuming Toyota dependability and quality will keep repair costs to a minimum. Heads will turn as you drive by, and people will ask you at the gas station, and at drive through windows, about your Matrix. 

Other Critiques
Mostly, I have suggestions to make it better. Interior colors offered are black and blacker, I would have liked a medium gray. Also the exterior paint options were slim, I�d like to see a yellow Matrix.
