             I just started a new job and I drive over 85 miles a day (both ways) and my V8 truck was costing me $200 a month in gas. I decided it was time to save money on gas and get something small. 
 I had a Nissan Stanza in college and it got about 25 MPG. I drive all highway and want at least 30 MPG. One day on my way home I saw a Black 4 door Focus and it looked really good. The next day I stopped in the Ford dealership by the office and drove one. 
 I was totally impressed by the way it drove and responded. Its a cross between a Japanese and a German car. I liked it so much that I drove it home 2 hrs later. 
 I just finished my 3rd tank and got 27.8 MPG. The owners manual said it wouldn't get good mileage until around 3,000 miles. If it gets better than 27.8 after its broke-in then I will be happy.
  I'm tall and the back seat is lacking leg room but I have small children and really bought it to commute. I think its a great car for the money and if its just for commuting or a small family. Its the finest small car I have ever seen. If you compare it to say a Ford Pinto of the seventies, well you understand. I think even Honda has some competition. <br><br>
