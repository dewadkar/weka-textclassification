            I have been watching digital cameras for a long time waiting for the price to be reachable to someone who doesn't really take pictures all that much, and didn't want to spend a fortune on one.  The price dropped below $300, and I happened upon this wonderful camera, and then the fun began.

What it comes with:
This camera comes with just about everything you need.  Long Life rechargable batteries, a charger, a memory stick.

Ease of use:
The camera is also very easy to use.  The menus are easy to navigate and the product with a little practice, is very user friendly.

Abilities:
Still pictures - In resolutions from 640X480 up to 1600X1200.  I have had prints made from the 1600X1200 in a size of 30X20 inches.  For wall hanging this is good.  And at that size you most likely wont be looking at it when it's a foot from your face.

Movies - 320X200 This feature is kinda fun to have, but I don't find myself using it that much.  It doesn't give the size, nor the sound that I really like.  Also the movies seem kind of jumpy.

Night Time shots - This is a very cool feature.  I have taken pictures of the Chicago night skyline and they came out great.  No need to use the flash.  The only drawback to this mode is that it's best used with a tri pod.  with the lowered shutter speed, you run the risk of a very blurry picture if you try to hold the camera still while the shutter is open.

The shutter lag is only there when you are using the autofocus setting, you can set the focus manually virtually eliminating shutter lag.

The support for the product is also great.  Sony gives you access to there websites that have a lot of useful tips and tricks for taking better pictures.

One of the websites that they tell you about is called Imagestation.  This site is a great companion to a digital camera.  It gives you unlimited hard drive space to upload and share your photos.  Once uploaded, you can order prints and enlargements of your pictures, and also different gift items featuring your photos.  The only recommendation is that you have a Cable or DSL modem for the best use of this site.
