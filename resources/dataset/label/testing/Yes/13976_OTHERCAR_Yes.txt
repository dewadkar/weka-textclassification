            Reviews of this vehicle can be found all over the net.  In researching the car I couldn't find a bad review.  The car was basically unchanged from 92 to 99 and for good reason.  It excels in every phase-- grace, power, handling, comfort, sound system, and the awesome Lexus reliability.  Now I have never considered myself a car snob (in fact I prided myself in not having a large depreciating asset sitting in the driveway)but I may have become one---secretly of course.  It's vanity I know but having an uncommon car and a Lexus to boot prevents people from guessing this beauty is almost 9 years old. I have to face my own pride whenever people turn to look at the car in parking lots and on the street...it's that nice. It has run flawlessly for 6 months after buying it used on Ebay.The fit and finish rival our new Volvo V70 despite the SC 400's age. Admittedly my kids are a tight squeeze into the back seat (11 and 7) but its a daily commuter par exellance...I find myself making excuses to go on errands in it.  At the risk of gushing I feel this is the finest car I have ever been in or around.  Consumer reports rates it as one of the most dependable used cars around.  If you have a chance to obtain one I hope your experience equals mine. I would recommend this car to anyone but a teen or inexperienced driver.  I would not want to tempt a teen with 0-60 mph in 6.3 sec, and 150 mph top end in this 250 HP 4cam 32 valve 4 liter V8 rocket. To buy this $50,000 car in 1993 dollars at a steep discount for a reliable machine and have it maintain a decent resale price is a real value.
