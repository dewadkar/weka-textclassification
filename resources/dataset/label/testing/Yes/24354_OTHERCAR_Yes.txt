                  My husband is an attorney ,and he had always wanted a BMW.So, he recently purchased a cherry red one.There are alot of things we like about our car.First,it drives well.Even though it has alot of miles on it,the beamer still handles great.We also like the way it looks.The model of the Bmw never goes out of style.The large trunk is something that we use alot also.It  also has a nice sounding stereo system, and a fast warming heater.
     There are a few things that we do not care for.For instance, we wish that the car was a bit larger.Since we have two children,we need all the room we can get.I like the leather seats, but in the weather they make for a cold ride.The dash is curved;therefore,you cannot sit anything on it.

     The BMW is a status symbol ,and if that is want you want it is the car for you.We like it ,but I do not know if we would purchase another one.<br><br>
