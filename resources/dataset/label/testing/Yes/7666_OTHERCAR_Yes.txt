            As a long time BMW fan, it took me over 3 years to find an E30 M3 in the condition I wanted.  It was not tracked, raced or abused in any way by the previous owner and to my surprise all original right down to the factory radio that came with it.  I fell in love with it instantly when I first drove it for a test drive.  After that I thought the asking price of $10,000 would fit my budget, so I purchased it and drove it home.  The car had 90,000 miles on it when I bought it and ran like a DREAM!  It has the most unbelievable exhaust sound and lots of power out the 2.3 liter 4 cyl.  But don't get me wrong here, this car HAS to be taken care of LIKE a high end sports car.  If you neglect maintenance on the E30 M3, it will show and end up costing you a lot more $$$ then you bargain for.  The most important things to maintain are the valves (VERY IMPORTANT) timing chain, and the header bolts as they will come loose after time and give you a good size exhaust leak.  The only thing that is disappointing on the E30 M3 is how tight the wires are bundled together, they rub against plastic parts and they wear, so be careful when working around the wires.  I now have 147,000 miles on my M3 and it's running like it has 147,000 miles on it, once again, it is a high performance car and will need more attention and money spent over time.  Overall the car ROCKS!! one of the best bmws ever made.  This car has a "race car" personality and is sensitive to those who don't take care of it.  So if you don't like tuning your car every month and just enjoying it for what it is, the E30 M3 is just not for you.  Please fell free to contact me for more info at tellmem3@aol.com
