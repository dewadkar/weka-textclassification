            We have had our Saturn SL2 since Sept 1995 and LOVE IT.  It has over 72,000 miles and still runs like we just bought it yesterday.  My husband is in the Navy so we had to move from San Francisco to Texas and then back to San Diego.  In that time we were living in TX we have traveled back to San Francisco for vacations 3 times and he drove it to Florida for school and we have not had any major problems with the car.  I have never been worried that I would be broken down on the road somewhere either, very reliable!

I have also been hit in the rear when I was at a complete stop and the other driver travelling at 50 mph, we walked away unhurt and I didn't even have a dent in the car.  We just had a guy hit the side back of my car and heard the most awful sound of metal, I was sure there was major damage.  When I looked I didn't have a dent, scrape not even any missing paint, can't say the same for his car.  The only thing that damaged my car was a hailstorm, $3,000 but the insurance company took care of that and a Saturn dealership had my car repaired and all the dents in the roof and hood out within 24 hours.  I have NEVER seen a company work so fast and with such care before.

The only problem we had with our car was that a modular went out, but they were able to get the part and fix it rather quickly.  Not only is the car the best but so is the whole company!!!<br><br>
