            It was getting cold and my 15-year-old car just couldn't take anymore.  I had to get into a more reliable car before the weather started to get bad.  Originally, I wanted a Honda Civic.  I went to several different dealers and none of them was willing to work with me for what I wanted.  The Ford Dealer that I went to suggested that I try a Contour.  I test drove it and never thought about a Civic again.  I'm 6'2, so of course it would have been extremely difficult for me to fold up into just any economy sized car.  The Contour proved to be spacious and comfortable.  It handles like a full size vehicle, but doesn't take a full size purse to fit into.  I paid very little money compared to the average cost of most economy size vehicles and came out with much more overall.  My contour offers power everything and cruise control.  I do wish that I had gotten the package with the CD player, but I can get around to that later.  If I had purchased another car with the amount that I paid for my Contour, I would have been cramped up in a tiny little car feeling every pebble and stone that I drove over.  During our first weekend together, I took it on the road, just to see what it was made of.  It handled like a dream.    I love my Contour and I'm so happy that I made such a wise investment.<br><br>
