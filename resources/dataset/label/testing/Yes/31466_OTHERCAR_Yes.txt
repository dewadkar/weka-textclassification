            I had an opportunity to buy this camera on sale at our local OfficeMax. As mentioned in review, this is a very good choice for overall value minded users.
The camera itself is built well and has an impressive 2.31 megapixel quality which allows photo-quality resolution prints up to 8"x10" (remember the higher the pixels the better end result for printout). The USB connectivity is a plus on any camera and this has it. The 318 has 8 meg of internal memory and allows expansion of whatever "compact flash" size you can afford. Nice color LCD display at 1.7".
I did have a bit of software conflict on my system at the time I first loaded the connectivity, but it seems o.k. if you do not have a lot of system background apps running. The only thing I saw as somewhat a bother was the lag time between the press of the shutter button to the actual flash time. (as you should know with all digital cameras, there is a slight lag in time - minimal but there).
Overall I would recommend this camera for the plus factors and the price which at the time of this writing is 199.99, but as you should always do, check sites like Pricewatch.com and mysimon.com for checking lowest cost.
