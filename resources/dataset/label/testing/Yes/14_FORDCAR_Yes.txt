            I bought my '99 Taurus SE in November '99 to replace my '97 GL.  The 2000's were few and far between and not yet at a reasonable price.  The '97 was great but was totalled in an accident with a cell-phone driver.

Overall, I like the design of the car.  Ford has obviously spent the last 13 or 14 years trying to perfect this car, but I think I must have gotten a model that was built by disgruntled factory assemblers in Chicago.  The first car we were to take delivery on had numerous paint flaws and a cracked front cross-piece in the front of the engine compartment.  Since I knew the salesguy pretty well and he wasn't giving me quite the same deal he did on the '97, he was able to get me another one, even thought it was the end of the model year.

The following problems came with the car:

Lug nut stripped at the factory
Strong antifreeze odor coming into the cabin
Excessive fuel consumption (&lt;20 mpg); even in moderate weather with no a/c
Terrible shocks/struts

THE CHANGES

In general, Ford cheapened the feel of this car when they took a few things out to de-content and shave costs, notably the glovebox light.  There's nothing more irritating than trying to identify the contents by touch when trying to find something while driving on the interstate at night.  They also removed the 2 underdash interior lights.  They also removed the keyhole power locks where you insert your key and unlock all doors by turning twice.  That's a small complaint considering I do have keyless entry.  It cheapens it nonetheless.  In addition, I have the 6-passenger seating option with the flip-console.  For some reason they made the cloth on the armrest different from the cloth on the seats.  It will probably wear a little faster than the cloth on the seats, and I almost swapped it with the armrest in my old, wrecked car which was sitting at a body shop.  And while I don't have any measurements, I think the seat doesn't go back as far as on the '97.  I'm a rather tall person and that was the first thing I noticed.

Some drivers may wish the speedometer was at least marked in 10 mph increments rather than 20 mph increments.  But the red needles on the silver background is quite fun when the lights are on.  I've also enjoyed having a tach on both cars even though you don't need one on this car.

One last thing. I change my own oil most of the time.  The first time I changed the oil on the '99 I noticed that they managed to route some sort of tube for the power-steering right over the area you need to reach in to get at the filter.  That's just a down-right poor design change, and if the filter is really stuck on there (like it was from the factory) you WILL burn yourself.
