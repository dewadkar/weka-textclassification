            After putting 100K miles on my current sedan, I compared several GM "utility" vehicles, not wanting to enter the minivan crowd, but needing to fill my need for a "family car". I looked at the Pontiac Aztek, Pontiac Vibe, and the Saturn VUE. - Being "young" I was interested in this new group of cars aimed at thrill-seeking, but gainfully employed Gen-Xers.

Aztek was too big, ugly in a cute kind of way, but expensive and bad on gas. Vibe was a good size, and good looking, but options are only available as package groups, all of which tended to push the $17,000 starting price out of my wallet's reach.

I wanted MY blend of style & price economy, and here Saturn's pricing model worked in their favor. Add a government crash test of 5 stars, front and side, and I was sold.

Saturn lets you pick the engine (4 or 6 cylinder) and the drivetrain (5-speed manual, 5-speed auto, or VTI belt, plus front or all-wheel drive) You use this to define  your base price. Aside from front airbags, everything else is an option.

Being a little on the tight side, I opted for a basic manual FWD 4 cylinder. For safety I added the $600 ABS/Traction control (something I believe should be as standard as the airbags), a GM standard $290 CD player, $75 rubber floor mats, and my only concession to style, $400 alloy wheels. Total price tag, a reasonable $18,275.

What's the VUE like? It definitely looks like a Saturn, for those of us that need brand recognition, with the center-oriented headlight band up front, but it's got enough purposeful lines that guys won't mind being in the driver's seat. The color palette at the moment is a collection of black, white, and red with the usual metallic variations, or a stunning autumn orange color. Mid September promises a lovely cobalt blue, followed by a hunter green a bit brighter than that found on the average Ford Explorer. The alloy wheels are interesting, yet sturdy looking 5-spokes with rounded corners. It's a balanced look.

Inside the VUE seems larger than it is. The dials and instrument display nicely complement the 17" diameter steering wheel. Because of the height-accenting exterior, windows and windshields are large. Truck-sized side mirrors and a wide, eye-level rear-view help in providing an outstanding view of the road.

The seats are fully adjustable, substantial, and comfortable. Controls are thoughtfully placed, with firm but comfortable action. Blinkers and wipers require almost no reach to find, but resist the occasional bump from fingers doing the steering. The shifter knob is center console mounted, ready for your right hand without shifting your elbow on the armrest. Automatics have a sporty squeeze-action, with the button located toward the front of the knob.

Saturn can tell you about leg room and cargo space. All seemed adequate or luxurious to my compact-car mind. Seating was comfortable. Getting into and out of the VUE is so easy it leaves you feeling like you're forgetting something.

Driving the VUE is different from driving a sedan. It feels wide. Acceleration is brisk, even with a 4 cylinder. The ride is smooth, and the electronic steering provides truly effortless turning at speeds below 40 mph. Coupled with a shiftless VTI transmission, the experience is that of a larger luxury car, with a better view. Watch those turns! I've voted for the manual, because I want to be more in touch with my engine.

The car-like wheelbase should allow easy parking. I confess, since it was only a test drive, I didn't want to experiment.

It's not an off-road warrior, but with 25-28 mpg on the highway, easy entry and exit, and great visibility, the VUE should find a happy home with many road warriors.

Can't wait for my blue one to come in!
