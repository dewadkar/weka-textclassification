            This Cherokee is just plain fun to drive, it's not by any means a luxury vehicle, but for those who actually enjoy the feel of the road and a responsive vehicle with better than average acceleration and agility, the high output 4.0 liter is more than sufficient.

The '98 Cherokee Sport is our second Jeep. Currently we have about 103,000 miles on it and have had only one minor problem with it - the cooling system was acting up. The remedy was the replacement of the radiator cap.  

Our other Cherokee is a 1992 Laredo 4 WD, with leather and power everything. That vehicle is now approaching 200,000 miles and has yet to give us any cause for concern. Though we did, on the recommendation of the Jeep dealership replace the radiator, hoses, water pump and belt at 150,000 miles.
That's a pretty small price to pay for the first 150,000 miles of service.

The '98 2 WD Sport also weighs several hundred pounds less than our other Cherokee - since it's lacking the skid plates, power seats, towing package, transfer case and front differential. This and the fact that the '98's power plant is more efficient translates to much higher fuel efficiency ( 16 to 18 m.p.g. around town and 20 to 21 m.p.g. on the highway) and better handling. 

Both Cherokee's use the 4.0 liter, high output in line six cylinder engine and for my money this engine is one of the most dependable ever built. ( you'll find this same engine in many Grand Cherokee's as well.)

Overall, I rate the 1998 Cherokee Sport 2 WD very high in dependability, fuel efficiency and cost of ownership. The added bonus is since it's a 2 WD drive model, our insurance premiums are lower than on our 4 WD drive model. 

When push comes to shove, just how many vehicles offered "at this price point" will go 100,000 to 200,000 miles with little or no trouble? 
This is the reason why so many Jeep owners continue to be Jeep owners and it's also the reason you see so many older Jeep Cherokee's on the road.
It's also the reason why I'm in the market for a third Cherokee ( for weekend jaunts ).

If you're looking for a vehicle that will actually be ready to go when you are and don't want to dump a load of cash on a vehicle, then I'd strongly suggest taking a thorough look at the Cherokee, in what ever package suits your needs.
