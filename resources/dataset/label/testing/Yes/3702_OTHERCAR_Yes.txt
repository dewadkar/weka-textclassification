            What can i saw about the new 2001 Honda Civic? It has evolved a lot throughout the years and this year it is Great!

My dad once rented a 1999 Honda Civic and he just so happened to rent it right when we were going to buy my sister's new Civic. After riding the 1999 model, we started to have second thoughts about buying a Civic. the 1999 model was loud, really cramped, and didn't drive very well. We went to the dealer and test drove a new 2001 Honda Civic and we couldn't believe that we were riding in a Civic. My dad and I rode in the back seat and my sister drove. We first noticed the flat bottom in the rear seat. It gave us much more leg room. In the rear, there is also a lot of head room and can fit 3 adults comfortably. If you look at the civic, you might think that the back seat if REALLY small but it isn't. In this case, your eyes are tricking you because there is tons of room in the rear seat. Finally after about only 2 hours, we were proud to purchase a 2001 Honda Civic LX 4 door.

Okay enough of MY story...i'll tell you about the features about the car.
Honda redeisgned the whole Civic for the year 2001. The exterior image might not catch your eyes at first, but when you actually buy the car, you grow to love the unique body. The Civic has three trims, the DX LX and EX. The DX is the standard model and the EX comes with all of the accessories that you could imagine. The exterior no longer has an antenna and still gets good reception. The trunk is also very large. It seems like it is really small but it isn't. The trunk has an emergency open switch in the trunk which allows you to get out of the trunk if you ever get stuck in there. The two rear seats also fold down. Those can also be opened from trunk. The rear seats are just like before. Honda has redesigned the rear seats so that there is not an annoying bump in the middle. This allows there to be more room in the back for passengers. The rear seats are very comfortable and as a lot of leg room. Moving up to the front of the vehicle we have the driver seat. The driver seat is the same but everything around it is different. 

The Vallet key is made so that it can only turn on and off the engine. So that means that you can hide all of your valuables in the trunk and the vallet driver will not be able to steal it. The windshield cleaners are different this year. Instead of squirting out water onto the windshield, it actually mists the windshield and makes it easier to clean. The interior lights are very bright and allow you to see things during the night time. The shifter for an automatic transmission civic is different too. Instead of a boring gray one, Honda has given it a futuristic chrome look which is very appealing. There are two cup holders in the front which are both different sizes so that you can fit all different drinks in there. The stereo system in the car isn't weak anymore. It is as clear as water when you play a tape or CD. The stereo has bigger knobs so that you can adjust the volume. I think that the best thing about the stereo is that the radio station changed is a knob so that it is easier AND faster to get to the station you want. The stereo can also store 12 FM stations and 6 AM stations which is great. Everything is convienently in reach. The driver seat adjusts very easy. There are a lot of storage spaces in the front. The grip of the steering wheel is GREAT. You can also see all of the instruments very well. The civic gets good mileage. My sister has only filled up her tank TWICE and she has already been able to drive 540 miles on it. If you do your math, that is about 270 miles per tank and with the rising gas prices, this car safes you a lot of money. Unlike the Toyota Corolla, the Civic's head rests are very comfortable and adjustable.
