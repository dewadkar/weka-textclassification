            <b>We Needed A Truck</b>
In 1998 we purchased a new Ford F-150 crew cab.  Our decision to buy this truck was based on the price - we needed a truck mostly to pull our camp trailer.  We were also picking up day old food from a local grocer and delivering it to needy families.  We had been driving a small Nissan truck, but it simply was not large enough for all the food we were getting, we needed a FULL size truck.

<b>The Search Was On</b>
We didn't have a lot of money to spend, so we first looked at used trucks.  Man, those dealers must make all their money on used vehicles because their prices were outrageous.  We looked at Chevy and Dodge, as well as the Fords.  We wanted the crew cab for extra room and comfort when going camping in the summer.  We really liked the back seats on the Fords.  It was higher than the Chevy, and it was just roomier, more like a regular seat.  We had done our homework and walked into the dealers with the invoices from internet shopping, and they knew we were not going to bargain with them.  They let one go for our asking price, so the Ford it was!!
 
<b>Driving and Handling</b>
We both like the way this truck drives!   The first thing I told my husband was, "this rides more like a car than a truck".  It was very smooth and quiet.  It also gets good gas mileage, up to 24 mpg in the summer.  It is an automatic, and shifts very smoothly and quietly, and it handles well.  I was <i>really</i> impressed with how well this <i>truck</i> drove and rode!  It has a lot of power, and it is not sluggish at all, it really goes when you step on the gas!  Because we wanted to keep the cost as low as possible, this truck has no added options.  A simple radio, and no power windows, seats, etc.  The one problem area for me was parking!  At first I would park at the end of a parking lot, away from other vehicles.  But now I have learned that if I back into a parking space, it is quite easy to get out of.  Still, after driving the small pick up for some time, this took some getting used to!  I am short, only 5'2", and I get a very good view of the road from this truck.

<b>Reliability</b>
After one year, we had problems with the breaks giving out - TWICE!  They simply turned to mush when we pushed on the break pad.  They were under warranty and Ford fixed the problem both times.  Our local Ford dealer was very courteous and efficient, getting us in and out of the shop very quickly.  They even took me to the mall so I could do some Christmas shopping while the truck was being repaired.  This model has also had several recalls, which Ford fixed at the time of the break problem.  One of the recalls had to do with seatbelt safety.

<b>Interior</b>
The front bench seat will seat three adults quite comfortably. You could put four small people there but it would be a bit cramped.  The third door on the passenger side is very nice, it makes it very easy to get in and out of the truck.  The seating is quite comfortable in the back as well, although not as comfy as the front sear.  If you have long legs I would suggest you sit in the front!!  :)  There is plenty of head room in the front and back alike.  This model has no carpeting on the floor, just the plastic, but that's fine - less to clean (and my hubby is not good about cleaning our vehicles).

<b>Matching Topper</b>
We bought a topper for this truck, but are sorry about the choice we made.  We didn't get one that was higher near the tailgate.  We felt it would cut down on our good gas mileage because of the air drag.  Getting the four wheeler in and out is a chore, we have to take the cap off to load it.  Had we spent a few hundred dollars more for the style that was elevated in the back, we would have been much happier.  By the way, the camper shell has a lock on it, but so does the tailgate, which is a nice feature.

<b>We Love the Four Wheel Drive</b>
Our model has four wheel drive, a huge plus if you live in parts of the country where there is a lot of snow and ice.  We live in Alaska, so we have given it a good test, and it has not failed us once.  It is very easy to put into and out of four wheel drive, but it does tend to get worse gas mileage if this feature is used for long periods of time.

<b>Conclusion</b>
All in all we have been happy with the purchase, since we had the repairs done, it has been virtually trouble free.  I feel safe when I am riding in this truck.  The long bed gives us a ton of room for camping gear, even when the four wheeler is loaded inside the bed there is plenty of room to store our other belongings.  I have ridden in some trucks where you KNOW that you are riding in a truck.  (Diesels are SO noisy).  This is one "hushed" truck!
