            Like a rock... That is what Chevrolet's 1999 Silverado full size pickup truck still feels like, although its first major redo since 1988 has made it larger, faster and stronger. The $15,355-$32,548 Silverado...also sold as the GMC Sierra...is a big deal in the auto industry because the full size pickup is General Motors' largest selling vehicle...car or truck. Ford gave its fairly new full size pickup shapely styling. But GM has retained its big pickup's handsome, square-shouldered look because that's what its consumer clinics found most people wanted. The Silverado still basically has a workhorse appearance, although there has been some softening of its lines. The new model looks slicker when parked alongside the old one.
