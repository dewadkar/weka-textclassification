            I recall the days when I used to make fun of Beamer owners... those super yuppies with their slick cars and golf clubs.  Well, now I have joined their ranks.  Forget the golf clubs, this car is great.

I seem to be one of the few who dislike wood trim inside their car, so the premium package was out.  I wanted to pick and choose which features I wanted, including folding rear seats.  I had to special order the thing and ended up waiting for 2 months.  In hindsight I probably should have opted for the premium package after all and gotten my car much sooner.  My sweetheart keeps reminding me how much she likes wood trim.  Yuck.  But the electric adjustable seats with memory would have been quite nice.  Just one push of a button and your seat moves to your specifications.  But in the end I believe I saved myself about $2000.

I read in another review that the leather seats looked cheap.  They probably opted for "leatherette" seats, which is NOT leather, but imitation.  I went for the real thing and it does feel quite nice, not cheap.  And I'm not even a big fan of leather, I prefer cloth.

One of the first things I noticed when driving the car home was the high tail, much like the Ford Focus.  It took a little getting use to not being able to see immediately behind me.  It does create a somewhat larger blind spot than some other cars, but the side windows keep it from being dangerous.

The BMW 325i was one of the few cars that my sweetheart and I could agree on... we have very different tastes (with mine probably being more dubious). It was a nice quiet ride, which was important, but did not sacrifice the handling.  I've been in cars that are so "floaty" that you feel removed from the driving experience - you can't feel the road at all and the extreme power steering makes it feel like your driving in one of those old Pole Position arcade games.  I drive much better when I have some resistance on the wheel. Anyway, this car is an excellent marriage between comfort and performance.  Performance enthusiasts might complain, and Cadillac-lovers might complain, but for people like me it was juuuust right.

One complaint I have is the slight delay when punching the accelerator before the actual speed boost.  I bought an automatic (necessary for one's sanity in traffic-ridden L.A.) with some reluctance.  When going from a stand-still the acceleration is wonderful and instantaneous.  However, when going above 20 mph the boost is less instantaneous.  The first time I wanted to zip in between cars in the next lane I came a little too close to being rear-ended because of the 1 or 2-second pause.  Now I know to take that into consideration. If I want better performance in that area then I could always switch into the "steptronic" clutchless manual or switch into 4-speed "performance mode" automatic.  There's an option for just about any mood!  I haven't played with either that much, but it is very simple to start using immediately.  I haven't needed to use those other options because the automatic is comparatively much superior to other automatics I've driven, for example my mom's Camry, my friend's Rodeo, and a Hyundai I rented.  Those cars tend to be very reliant on brakes for slowing down and are much more difficult to slow down than a manual.  You take your foot off the gas and it keeps right on going.  I hate that.  Not so in my BMW.  I still brake more than I'd need to in a manual, but it actually gears down while easing up on the gas.  The shifting is smooth and barely noticeable. It probably shifts better than I would!

My only other complaint is with the "Business CD" stereo.  (Why on earth is it called the "Business CD"?  Do business people need more out of their stereos than average people??)  The Pioneer stereo in my last car had tons more features than this one has.  It will not display the minutes of the track, even when in manual forward mode.  And no "repeat one song" option either (not that I miss it, but still).  I found that quite annoying.  But at least it was easier to figure out than my Pioneer was.

Trunk space is impressive for the car's size, and the option to have the trunk work separately from the car's central locking system is nice when valeting the car.

Gas mileage isn't impressive, but that may only be because my last car was a Honda Civic CX (a real econobox). But it isn't bad either, especially compared with the nasty gas-guzzling SUVs, or even others in its own class.  The sticker says it gets 17 city and 29 highway and it's about right.  I use the car mostly for commute in clogged stop-n-go freeways and city streets.  I tend to be easy on the gas pedal, so I average about 19 miles per gallon. On a recent trip to San Diego where it was clear sailing most of the way I averaged about 32 miles per gallon, it was nice!  Not bad for a sport sedan!

In all I'm am really glad I got this car.  It makes my 45-minute commute almost enjoyable!

************ REVIEW UPDATE *************

It's been almost a year of ownership and I still love this car.  A couple of things I need to note after much use...  The wheel wells significantly reduce the amount of hip room available in the back seat.  I would guess close to a foot of comfort space is lost.  If you jam 3 people back there, the ones on the either side will have to kind of sit sideways a bit to fit (unless they're narrow people).  The other thing that's good to know is that there is no possible way to bring home a Dell 17" monitor in its original box (without tying it to the roof).  Believe me, I tried.  It won't fit in the trunk because the opening is smaller than the actual space.  It won't even fit through any of the four doors I had!  Not the back seat and not the front seat either. (Imagine how hot and tired I got from lugging and pushing this massive thing back and forth.)  I finally had to remove the monitor from the box and leave the box out.  This is the only time I've ever missed my Civic hatchback.
