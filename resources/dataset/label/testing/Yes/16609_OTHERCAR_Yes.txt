            This is a good car! It has a large cargo area when you fold down the 50/50 split folding back seat. There's enough room for my mountain bike,some suitcases,and much more. It has the capabilities of a small truck [except 4wd]. Once when we put up 8 foot walls in our basement, we hulled them in the back of the Chevy.
The standard ABS system works great. I had to get new brakes a few times since I got it in 1997.  I must say that the things that broke on the car were in the first few months that we had it. The last year, nothing broke except the brakes needed replaced.It blew a gasket when I first got it. The A/C died [something simple-it works now and it is very cold!] the car now has 103,000 miles on it. it is a 1994 model. Those three things are about all that happened to it.  The coolant tank had to get replaced once, but that was very cheap. overall, it's a good car. the thing i liked most about it is that when it brakes, it will still run to get you to safety. The engine has lots of power for a 4 cyl. One thing I hate about the car is the paint. It gets tiny rust spots, and paint chips.
This car is dependable and it has lots of cargo space. 
There are also a lot of standard features like Power door locks and ABS. I like the car. Try to look for late models. 
Here is some more information about the Chevy Cavalier. The Cavalier has been restyled about four times. The V6 was dropped for 1995 and a new 115hp [previously 120 horses] 4-cyl replaced it. The 2.8 V6 was replaced in 1990 by the 3.1 V6 and the 2.0 4 cyl was replaced by the 2.2 litre 4 cyl engine. For 1994 the 2.2 got boosted to 120 horses.
In 1995, The Cavalier was completely rebuilt and now had dual airbags. The wagon was dropped.
The Cavalier got restyled for 2000. It got new head and tail lights,bumpers, and some other minor changes.
The first generation Cavalier [1981-1987], was around for a few good years. Soon, it was restyled to the second generation Cavalier['88-'90] it got new front and rear structures, head lights, tail lights, grille and some interior changes. The third generation Cavalier ['91 to '94] again got new head and tail lights, a new grille, a new dashboard and interior look.
UPDATE: Today my Cavalier's ABS light came on because the alternator went bad and shut the ABS system down. We drove to Taco Bell and the car broke down in the drive through [what a pain] i guess some people were blind because I turned the Hazard flashers on and cars were beeping [like i could go anywhere] I wanted to push it out of the way but it would of have to been pushed backwards across the street but the street was too busy. I am glad the cars could still drive around me to use the drive through. The alternator broke and the Serpintine belt needed replaced. a total of $265.00. I will never forget this day. Oh yea, the A/C died again because a rock hit and cracked the condenser.[or so the dealer said.]
