            We have had this '03 Malibu LS for about 5 months now, and have had NO problems.  It is fully loaded, except for the engine block heater, and is a great value for the money.  We almost bought an Infinity I35, until we checked out the Malibu.  We saved $12,000 by going with this car, and have not been disappointed.  We recently took it on a long driving vacation, and it did great.  We traveled almost 3500 miles, and got 31.6 MPG.  Most of it was highway miles, but we ran all over Las Vegas for a week.  Going through the high mountains of Colorado, the engine displayed plenty of power.  Although the seat cushions are a bit thin, I found that by varying the position of the power seat every couple of hours, I could drive all day, and not feel sore at the end of the day.  The sunroof was a real plus, and we found that by cracking it about an inch, we could get good ventilation with minimum noise, plus the view is great.  The stereo in this car is the best I've heard in a factory radio...It can "boom" with the kiddies if I want it to, and the auto volume, and traffic features are a nice plus.  
If I were to find anything negative about this car, it might be the lack of a trip computer.  I've gotten kind of used to having one in the car and truck, if for no other reason to check my fuel mileage, or outside temperature.  However, given what we paid for this car, I can live without that.  I would have to recommend this car to anyone who wants good solid transportation with most of the amenities, and doesn't want to mortgage the house to buy one.  After 5 months, the car doesn't even have a squeak or rattle..and we live on a gravel road in the country.
