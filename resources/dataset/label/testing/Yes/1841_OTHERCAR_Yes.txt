              My grandparents own this car.  Why they bought it over a Lincoln I will never know.  The car itself is not too bad, and it even has some really nice features.  The gear shift is very nice and fits easily into your hand.  The air conditioner is also really good and powerful. The car is decent for city driving and does not guzzle gas.

 The main problem that the car has is whenever you get on the highway.  At high speeds, the car does not do well.  It shakes quite a bit and the ride gets very bumpy.  Also, the car seems to be blown around quite a bit by the wind.  It is really hard to drive on the highway with this because you always feel like you something is wrong in the engine.

  Another problem is the brakes.  My grandparents bought the car brand new and have already had to have the brake pads replaced as well as the rotors.  They do not drive very often and put on only about 5,000 miles a year, if that.  The conditions in which they drive might have some factor (they live in Syracuse, the snow and salt capital of the world), but still, breaks should not go that fast.

 The car is also not extremely roomy and it is very difficult to seat four or five comfortably.  It is really made for short trips, because I really can't imagine sitting in that car for more than a half hour without cramping up.

 The car does have decent acceleration up to about 60 miles per hour.  It is really nice for driving in the 30-50 mph zone and does not have too much trouble going up hills.  Not everything about the car is all that bad.

 It also has some pretty good standard features (power locks/windows, a/c, tape deck, automatic, etc...), and the price is very affordable at 11,000-13,000.  Although I personally do not like the car very much, it is a decent car to have for short trips with a couple people.  A married couple might find this car very nice because of the price, but otherwise I can't really see too much need for it.

 It is definitely not a winner in my book.  Hopefully others will think twice about whether or not they're willing to spend more money before they put it down on this car.
