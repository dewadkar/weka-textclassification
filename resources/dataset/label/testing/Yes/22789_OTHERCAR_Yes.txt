            I bought a 99 Hyundai Accent in August of 99 after several failed attempts to buy a used car from a salesman (if you've ever gone car shopping with little money, you know what this irritating experience is like!)  After finding a used car that I felt as good as possible about purchasing, I went to pick it up and they sold it.  So I went to a main dealer's car expo looking for used car and left with a brand new one.  It's white, four door, and I love it.  I was spoiled in high school with a 97 Nissan Sentra and this was my first car that I had to pay for.  My payments for this new car are $151.00 a month!  Above all, the warranty is 10 years!  Who can beat that?! 
I love the accent because I can park it just about anywhere.  And as long as I keep up the conditions of the warranty, if anything goes wrong, it's covered for 100,000 miles. The gas mileage is great, too. What I don't like is that I should have bought an Elantra because it offers automatic locks, which I need with a toddler of my own.  I also, admittedly, don't feel too safe in it.  The body reminds me of an aluminum can.  I see other Hyundai's that are all dented up.  The resale value is extremely low.  If you buy a Hyundai, keep it for as long as you can.  I wouldn't recommend buying one used, either.  My suggestions when buying a Hyundai: buy the newest model possible, because the newer models are updated and come with great warranties.
The driving is smooth but it doesn't have too much pick-up.  
This car is ideal for a college student, a first car for a teenager, or for a second, economic, family car.<br><br>
