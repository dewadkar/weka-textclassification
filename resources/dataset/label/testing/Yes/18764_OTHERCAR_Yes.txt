            Having recently moved to NYC, I find myself constantly surround by peculiarities.  Old men urinating in subways.  Gigantic, obese women shouting at bags of garbage.  Babies smoking cigars.  Imagine my delight, then, at the Casio watch-camera.

Picture quality is certainly not print-perfect.  However, it holds 100 pictures in its 1MB memory, which are easily uploadable to a PC (through a $50 accessory) or second camera through IR.  It's simple- the watch captures video, much like a regular camera, the shutter button freezes the image and stores it to memory.  I have found, after uploading, that pictures which I thought were junk become instantly better, due in part to the higher resolution of the PC monitor.  This, and the ability to save your pictures, makes uploading more than worth the trouble and expense.

Range is AMAZING.  I have taken pictures of things as large as an entire beach, and as small as Wonder Woman figurines, all with near-perfect quality.  I have taken pictures in dark bars, I have taken pictures in bright stadiums, all have been astonishing considering, again, it's A WATCH.

More to the point, though, is that you just can't beat the stealth.  With regular cameras, you have to contend with bulk, shutter sounds, and flashbulbs.  That old man urinating in the subway would surely murder you, if photographed.  However, with something as tiny, quick and unexpected as a WATCH, all of these photographs can be mine.

I suggest you do NOT, however, bring your Casio WQV1-1CR Wrist Camera Watch into a strip club.  Doing so will get your Casio WQV1-1CR Wrist Camera Watch smashed over your rotten pervert face.

I DO suggest, however, that you buy one of these, immediately.
