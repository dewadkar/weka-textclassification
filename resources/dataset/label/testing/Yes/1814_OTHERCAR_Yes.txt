            We have previously owned a Dodge Caravan & a Jeep Wrangler and decided to take the plunge (financially) to buy a Dodge Durango. We chose to start off with a 2001 model (which is 2 years old) and had 52,000 miles on it.
 It was in great shape and met our budget needs so we decided to give it a try.
It is a very nice truck and I am really happy with it.
We have 4 children ranging from 5 to 15 years old, so we needed something roomy and dependable for a family of 6 that are always on the go!
The Caravan was nice-but this Durango is wonderful !
 I love the 3 rows of seats which reminds you of a van but had the rugged features of a jeep.
Plus when we are all in it we actually have one seat EMPTY which is a hard thing to find with a family of six!
 The only 2 disadvantages is the price of the vehicle and the gas mileage, but we decided that the price was worth a dependable car and the gas mileage is worth the powerful engine.
 The most wonderful surprise of all though was the climate control feature! We did not know it until we were ready to buy it that both front seat passengers can control the air going toward them in the dash board. If you are in a relationship where you always disagree over the temperature then you HAVE to have this SUV !
 My brother and a friend of ours both have SUV's (neither of them a Dodge) and they both have agreed that after looking at our Durango that it was a nicer vehicle to have. It was more stylish inside and out and was roomier as it had 2 rows of seats in the back-verses their one row.
Of course their is the issue of price. We are paying around $150 MORE a month than they are......so their is the question of it being a better value or is it you get what you pay for?
 My kids love it because they can climb all around the seats and have plenty of room and they love the drink holder in the middle of the first row of seats.....what they now want is a tv and game system installed (but that is for another story) haha
 So-all in all we have all rated it two thumbs up.
I have noticed the popularity of the Dodge Durango-and they seem to be getting a lot of attention and I can really see why.
 If you are single and on the go or have a family who never stops-this is the vehicle for you!
