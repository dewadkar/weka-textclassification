            This is truly an awesome vehicle. It has power and torque to climb virtually any terrain.
           The 4x4 action on this beast is superior to any unmodified four wheel drive. But, the four
           wheel drive is only one great aspect of this beaut. Once the warm summer nights creep
           in, one can remove the top of this off-roading legend and cruise the streets in style. I
           personally own the larger engine of the two, the 4.0 liter sport. Using a larger engine of
           course depletes gas mileage but even so Jeep has never been known for the
           extra-ordinary gas mileage. I have driven both the four cylinder, and the much more
           powerful 4.0 liter, and there definitely is a difference. I have had no trouble
           what-so-ever, with any thing under the hood.
           There are not many cons that come to mind with this legend of war, but the one that is
           noticeable is a extremely rough ride on the road. The short wheelbase defiantly
           demeans the word &quot;comfort&quot;. But most definitely I will substitute a little comfort, for
           STYLE.
           I personally love my Wrangler, and am constantly adding things to it such as larger tires,
           better wheels, roll bar lights, wet suit seat covers. Upon adding these things, I obtained
           a vehicle of uncomparable style. I truly love my jeep.<br><br>
