            As a new driver, this was my first car.  All my driving experiences, thanks to my parents, had been of upper-class luxury cars so my expectations were high.  It's a good looking car, and the interior is not bad either.  It gets pretty good miles per gallon, and only cost me at most $17 to fill it up.  The acceleration isn't very good, but it is a 4-cylinder car.  Once you get up to 60mph or so, it accelerates well from that point.  That handeling is ok, although it does slip a bit in the rain.  It takes corners well and drives pretty good.  I like this car, and I recommend for teenagers.
