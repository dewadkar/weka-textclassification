            I didn't mean to buy this car.  We knew we needed a bigger vehicle, basically since 1998 (December 19 to be exact) when our three children family became a four children family, but we kept putting it off, unwilling to get into another new car payment.  But by January of this year we knew it was either get a bigger vehicle, or strap one of the kids to the roof so we could travel together.

I'm the designated car buyer.  In actuality, the designated everything buyer, as the hubby doesn't like to be bothered with the infinite details of search and destroy that go with getting any new item.  But our four sons are game for product comparison and gladly accompanied me on my latest trek to find a larger vehicle.  

The hubby fought the idea of a van, thus our year long search to find one as he gradually came to grips with the fact that four growing boys cannot fit into anything smaller than a van.  In the last year I've driven the Pontiac Montana, Mazda MPV, Chevy Venture, Chevy G-20 and Dodge Ram 1500 conversion van.  As far as the minivans go, they all drive the same, much like a car a bit higher off the ground and all that differentiated one from another were the features.  

The first three all had televisions, removable seats, CD players, electric everything (you name it, there was a button to do it)and overpriced stickers that caused a shock to send me into next week.  The two full sized vans drove like trucks and I was absolutely positive I would never be able to park either to the top of our property long driveway and not take out the side of the house, or the neighbor's bushes on my way back down again.  But their stickers were a little lower and the payments more in our range.  Plus the G-20 had a TV, a definite perk to 3 of my 4 comparative shoppers.

I should say that price was the highest driving factor in purchasing our larger vehicle.  Our oldest child will be attending a prep high school in the fall, our third is firmly embedded in the parochial school system and the second just announced he's defecting from the public school system for middle school and entering the private school sector as well.  If we wanted to be able to eat before 2011 we either had to find a nice used van or a decent payment on a new one.  Thinking we couldn't possibly afford a new car payment we went the used car route and started visiting the better dealers in the southeast Chicagoland/Northwest Indiana area we live.

I came to the Caravan by accident, much to the credit of the overzealous salesman who accosted me and #2 son when we entered the parking lot.  (#2 was the designated shopper for this lot, the other 3 left inside our depressingly small Neon to eat their hamburgers while we shopped)  Taking his salesman of the year training to heart he informed us in the first 60 seconds that he lived in our home town and was a past member in the same little league #2 son's cap revealed, even playing the same position, AND that he knew he could find something for us that evening.  As #2 son and I walked into the dealership I whispered to him that this salesman probably would have said he played girl's softball too if my son had said he played that.

Well to my surprise, not only did he indeed live in our town and play in the little league, he was able to show us a brand new car in our price range.  #3 son test drove with me, pronouncing the car more than liveable, but being he's 52 inches tall and 62 pounds heavy I had the two older sons sit inside it as well while the future salesman of the year went inside to run up our numbers.

There's nothing electrical in my model (though I couldn't say this is true for all Caravans) but being able to open the passenger's window from my seat isn't high on my priority list.  I did get 15" wheels, fold away mirrors, tinted glass, a radio/cassette player, two sliding doors, air conditioning, cargo net, 6 cup holders (two I just found last week), 4 power outlets (important when there's 3 boys wanting to play their Gameboys on those 2 1/2 hour jaunts to see their favorite aunt), and an underseat lockable storage bin (also not found until after I drove it off the lot as owner).  Very important was the 2.4L 4 cylinder automatic transmission that gets 20 mpg city, 24 highway. Being I drive half and half I get about 21 mpg, not bad for a vehicle this size.

Well my salesman came through, not just with a great payment, but also $2000 in rebates, first for just buying the Caravan, and second for trading in a Chrysler for a Chrysler.  I left the lot that night with enough room to take everyone every place, and a payment we could live with.

My Caravan is a Sport Edition, so I have some neat grey accents and a white dashboard that I at first found disconcerting during the day, but now I don't even notice.  This was a pro in the hubby's eyes, as if he has to drive a van (and a minivan at that) it's as sporty as a minivan can get.  

On the con side, there could be more storage in the back.  When I grocery shop inevitably several bags, all the milk, kitty litter and laundry soap wind up in a spare seat or on the floor.  Part of this is that I have the minivan version, the Grand Caravan takes care of that problem, but was $70/month too tight on the budget.  We also started leaking oil last week.  With our Neon we went through 4 head gaskets in 5 years, and the eminent demise of the 5th head gasket had me running to replace this car when I did.  Turns out it was just as loose hose, something they think was disturbed when they replaced a bolt due to a recall.  Hopefully this is all that caused it, since I have heard head gasket problems are part in parcel of owning a Chrysler.  Lastly, the car was recalled 10 days after we bought it for a front end bolt that could possibly come loose and cause the driver to lose all steering control.  I saw this happen in person just a few days ago when, of all things, a teacher from the kids' school pegged off 5 cars at an intersection for what appeared to be no good reason.  Stopping to make sure she was okay she shakily told us she didn't know what happened, one minute she was steering, the next she was setting off other people's airbags left and right.  She was driving a Grand Caravan and I mentioned the recall, but she said her dealer told her the Grand Caravans were unaffected.  Well maybe not.

In all I'm glad we bought this car.  It's so nice to take all 6 of us where we need to go in the same car, and it's a fun drive.
