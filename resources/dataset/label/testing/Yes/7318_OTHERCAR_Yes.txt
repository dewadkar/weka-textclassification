            I received this camera for Christmas and I couldn't be happier with it.  It takes great photos, is very user friendly and uploading photos to your computer is extremely easy with the software Olympus provides you.  There are many options that this camera is capable of, including photo sequence (this allows for faster photo taking) which is extremely useful for active situations.  Additionally, the digital display on this is super-fast - no jerky movements like older cameras had.

There are only two downsides to this camera - #1 to view the photos you just took, you need to actually shut the camera off (which takes a few seconds since it involves the lens to retract back into the camera) and then you can review them (most other digital cameras have a toggle switch that you can quickly go back and forth with), and #2 is that you need an available port to plug this into - there is no USB connector.  However, these are minor setbacks, since the pros of this product far outweigh these two cons.

To avoid the expensive battery cost, Olympus makes a Ni-MH battery charger and rechargeable AA batteries.  I have found this product to be invaluable as well, as it only enhances the amount of money I have saved by purchasing a digital camera.
