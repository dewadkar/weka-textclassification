            Currently we own a Ford Expedition and a Ford windstar.  The windstar is a 95 and still runs nicely with a good 50000 miles on it.  I have driven a variety of cars from an escort to a cadillac deville, and the windstar fits right in the middle.  The steering is just about right, not too sensitive, and unlike the escort I drove the pedal never sticks and it starts smooth.  
The only problems we have had with it is some electrical things.  About once a month or so all the lights in the car blinks and it beeps (the sound it makes when the door is open and the leys are in).  We have taken it to every shop around here and no one can seem to find anyhting wrong with it.  Of course, it is better than our old station wagon which jolted every ten miles or so (that was pleasent).  
If anyone else is having this problem please leave a comment so I know I am not the only one.
We carpool a lot for bowling leagues and other functions, so the roominess is great for things like that, but loading it up with luggage can be a pain in the a**.  I have never even tried to remove the last seat, looks waaayy too complicated.
It certainly isn't very sporty looking, expecially the bright teal paint (arg...the ugliest thing I have ever seen.)


Hope this helps!<br><br>
