            As a former traveling salesman, I put a lot of miles on my vehicles.  When it came time to get rid of my old Ranger pickup truck with 311,000 miles, I decided to go with something that would not require me to fill the tank every day, plus the IRS only allows so much per mile, and I calculated that the cheaper the wheels, the better the bottom line when figuring in my expenses.

I have owned a 1994 Escort Wagon since new and it presently has 173,000 miles on it.  Repair cost to date as been next to nil.  I change the oil every 5,000 miles, and the radiator coolant every 30,000 miles, and the spark plugs every 60,000 miles.  The only other items that have been replaced is the front brake pads, the timing belt, and the alternator belt, all at 100,000 miles, and the tires when they would wear out at 50,000 miles.

I chose a manual transmission for the simple reason that I figured with 88 horsepower, an automatic would simply zap too much power.  I did last year rent a 1999 Escort sedan in Nevada with an automatic, and it was quite acceptable.  The newer structure is supposed to be stronger than the one on my wagon, but I could not tell much of a difference, nor could I detect any more power from the slightly larger engine.

The good thing about these cars is that they get excellent gas mileage.  I average in the lower to mid 30 mpg range.  They also have firm and supportive seats, steer nicely, and ride really well due to the fully independent suspension.  They are also well built with no detectible rattles.  Power is reasonably good, but one is not going to win any stoplight grand prix in one of these babies.  On a recent trip half way across the country, I did maintain speeds in the 85 to 90 mph range, and it was as steady as a rock.  The interior of the wagon is roomy as many SUV's, without having to haul around the bulk of those 4 wheel drive stationwagons.

All is not, however, peachy in baby Taurus land.  The engine does idle roughly, and the engine is noisy.  Also due to the low stance to the ground, getting in and out of the car is some what of a chore.  It is not as smooth as some of the newer cars from Japan, but then again, it is about $5,000 less expensive.  Some of the interior materials scream cheap, leaving you no doubt that this thing was built on a budget, and sometime rough roads upset its normally well behaved composure.  The overall package is well engineered, its just too bad it has been replaced by the funky looking Focus.
