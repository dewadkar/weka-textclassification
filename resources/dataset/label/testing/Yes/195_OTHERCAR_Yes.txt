            I got this car when my 1994 cheverolet cavelier broke down. I drive back and forth from home to school just about every other weekend. The drive is about 300 miles. This is an excellent car for the drive. It rides smoothly and is extremely comfortable. It is also a good car if you have a lot of things to pack back and forth. For me going to and from college is a big deal and this is a very spacious car. The back seats fold down ro create a bigger flatter space. Also there is a cargo cover in the trunk to cover what you have back there. This is nice because I know that if I stop along the way to get gas or use the restroom, I know that my things will be covered which will hopefully keep people from being tempted to break in. It also comes with a great 6 CD built in changer. The people at the dealership were great and I have not had any problems with it. I have had it for 5 months and have about 5,000 miles on it. Hopefully things will stay in the great shape that they are. I would reccomend this car to anyone, young, old, family, single.<br><br>
