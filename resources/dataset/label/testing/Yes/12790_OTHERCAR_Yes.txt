            I'm cutting straight to the essential knowledge you need before considering this product. With a whopping 3.3 megapixels of  resolution, the s20 offers the highest resolution per dollar of all the cameras that I�ve tried. The rear 1.8-inch LCD screen gives a through-the-lens look at your subject, and also doubles as the menu interface.

The camera can be easy use as �point and shoot�, but there are also plenty of programmable options. Features include centre-weighted (or spotlight) metering, which takes into account the light conditions of your subject compared with its surroundings. It accepts both type-1 and the new type-2 IBM Microdrive Compact Flash memory cards. It comes with an 8 Mb card, which can hold between three and 15 images at the maximum 2048x1536 pixel resolution, depending on the amount of JPEG compression you use (super-fine, fine, or normal).

A 2x-optical zoom and a 4x-digital zoom are available. The camera connects to your PC via either the serial or USB port. The only problem I found was the tiny, plastic cable connector at the end, which looked as if it could be broken easily. The s20 comes with heaps of software � 175 Mb of it � including Adobe�s Photodeluxe and a cute tool called Photostitch, which allows you to create panoramic vistas. Built-in power saving options stretch battery life. Overall, one of the best cameras on the market.
