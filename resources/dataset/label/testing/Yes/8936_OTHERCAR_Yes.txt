            We recently purchased an 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan and just love it!  After many months of research (we read all the auto issues of Consumer Reports, talked with other minivan owners, and visited several dealerships) we concluded that the Caravan offered the most for the money.
We had previously owned a 1995 Ford Winstar but were disappointed because it was constantly being put in the shop for repairs and factory recalls.
We had also considered buying an SUV but found them to be more expensive and offered less room for a family of 4.  With the Caravan my children each have their own seat (which is nice) and we always have extra room for friends and other family members.  The seats are very comfortable (nicely padded) and it is an easy van to drive.  We also like the fact that it has 4 doors (very convenient) and it offers many extras such as ample cup holders, dual air and little hooks in the back cargo area for shopping bags (this is to keep the contents from falling out and rolling around).  
So far we have had no repair problems other than replacing a light bulb in the cargo area because it had burnt out.  We plan on buying this make and model again and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable minivan.
