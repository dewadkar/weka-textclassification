             I started my search for a &quot;new&quot; car about nine months ago after an accident changed my career options. Moving from sub-thousand dollar cars to large, spacious, luxury vehicles seemed a daunting task to say the least. I did not wish to buy a brand-spankin' new car due to the high (read sticker shock) initial cost.
  My search began in the usual mind-numbing journey of talking to used car salesmen (I didn't talk to a single saleswoman). Having survived their onslaught I actually walked away with a concise picture of what I wanted. It wound up being the Chrysler LHS because, quite frankly, the other luxury vehicles in my price range were just too small. I am a six foot three inch, two hundred and eighty pound man and I am pleased to state that I have no trouble in this car. The car has even enough room for six foot plussers in the back, a definite plus in the sales business.
 I came across my green 1994 LHS at a wholesale auction and purchased it for a good price. Expecting some large, hidden repair bills often associated with unwarrantied vehicles, I have run across very few problems that routine maintenance hasn't handled. 
 The Chrysler LHS is a well behaved, predictable car that can still manage to turn the corners of my mouth into a smile at each bend in the road. Flatline acceleration is pleasant and stable with little torquesteer and with all the amenities of highline uber-vehicles, I can enjoy this car each and every time I pass my bank. <br><br>
