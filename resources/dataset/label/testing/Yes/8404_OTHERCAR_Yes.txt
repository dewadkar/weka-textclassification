            I own the D600L, and I can't say anything *really* negative about the unit.  First, I bought this a year or two ago and I was upgrading from
an Epson PC 500.

First, I sold the Epson PC 500 and bought the next up, the Epson PC 700.
It was ok, but... not really all that great when I was out taking pictures at the beach.  I turned it back in, and bought the Olympus.

I've been quite happy and my close up shots are great, for flowers mostly.
I'll email the JPG's for anyone interested in seeing some of my work.
However, I am by no means a professional photographer.

My gf gave me a carrying case that fits the D600L quite snuggly.  I've also been able to take the camera with me to many events with little trouble.  Overall, it's light... compact... and easy to use.

Might want to carry some extra Ni-Cad batteries!  This camera, although so wonderful... sure sucks those batteries dry!  I always avoid using the view screen in the back.

Software for this unit sells with it, and I use it with very little trouble!  It's easy to install, operate, and not confusing at all to extract your pictures from the camera.  The pictures are almost always great quality and you have a lot of control over the size of the picture and the ZOOM works GREAT!!!

BTW: I recently mailed it back to Olympus to upgrade the RAM ability in it.  It cost me $100.00 to get 32 Megs of RAM installed... the card looks almost like a floppy... but is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  Now that I've upgraded the unit, it can take up to 392 pictures!!
Damn, I don't know what I'm going to do with all those pictures... I'd pass out I think if I took that many... however, the ability is now there... and the camera was upgrade-able... BIG PLUS!  It means I don't have to shell out a bucket load more money on a new camera.

And hey, they even cleaned it for me and shipped it back within two weeks.<br><br>
