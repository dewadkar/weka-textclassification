            I have been using this camera since it came out at $400.  It has taken a lot of use and abuse and keeps on working.  Over 4000 pictures later, it still works like new. Although a discontinued model, I picked up other DC210 cameras at todays street price of $200.  I've given some as gifts.  And at this price, I am less worried about taking it everywhere. This camera is not only good for entry level... its great for everyone.  I recommend using rechargeable batteries and using the adapter while downloading at home.  A larger Compact Flash card is also strongly advised. Very simple and straight forward to use.
