            I bought my 97' Wrangler Sahara and have loved it everyday since.  As with any new vehicle there usually is a small flaw here and there.  Jeeps are notorious for having bad gas sending units and the Wrangler is no different, in 99' I received a recall notice on it.  Another problem area is that the register vents are fragile, so far I have broken 2 of them so far.  The &quot;up down&quot; adjuster &quot;thingy&quot; on it tends to break off if too much pressure is applied. Another problem is that the foam inserts in the cup trays tend to stick to the bottom of your cup and subsiquently you tend to lose them when you pick your glass up.  At $1.25 a foam piece it isn't too bad.  All in all I find that I  really enjoy my wrangler and wouldn't take anything for it (except maybe a Hummvee?). <br><br>
