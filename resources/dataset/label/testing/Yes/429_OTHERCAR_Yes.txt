            When we leased our 1998 V70 T-5 wagon, we were originally looking for an SUV.  We were looking for cargo space, room for kids, safety and all the other practical things you need.  However, we also both love cars that perform and handle well, so we were disappointed by SUVs generally.  

The V70 answered all of our needs and has served us very well for over two years.  I travel quite a bit on business, so I have only put about 31,000 miles on the car in over 2 and one half years.  First and foremost, this car is FAST.  I selected the T-5 level engine with the high compression turbo for sheer acceleration and speed.  I have never been disappointed.  The T-5 out accelerates the Porsche Boxter 0-60 and while it does not jump immediately off the line, as soon as the turbo spools up, the car rockets forward.  Braking is equally as impressive.

The handling is quite good for a wagon, but there is a slight trade off in getting that good road feel -- the ride can be a bit harsh on rough surfaces.  I willingly take that trade off (it isn't that bad) for the better handling.  The cockpit is comfortable and the good feel has made it easy to cruise in the 100-110 range (without the kids of course) with little increased effort required for control, etc.  I have achieved 125mph in this STATION WAGON with plenty of room to run.  In addition, the Alpine OEM stereo system is truly spectacular.  It is considerably superior than the Nakamichi OEM system in my wife's Lexus LS400.

The V70 serves well as a family car.  We can easily haul two kids and all the associated stuff.  Only when I add golf clubs and other miscellanous stuff for longer trips does it get crowded.  Obviously the car is safe, both in performance and safety systems.

I have few complaints and have had only moderate problems with the car during our ownership.  There have been a number of small failures covered by our warranty, such as an oil gasket on one component, etc.  In addition, I have had a couple of problems with warped brakes discs (we live on a large hill) and a burned out wheel bearing, but all were graciously covered by Volvo.  In addition, there have been two or three recalls.  All in all, it has been in the shop a bit more than it should, but then again, it is a Volvo and I do drive it like a crazy man...<br><br>
