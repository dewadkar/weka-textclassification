            I dare you to try to find another fantastic 4.0 Megapixel digital camera at this price!  I am in love with my Kodak dx4900!  I purchased this camera when I found a price that was too phenomenal to pass up.  I am so pleased with the performance of this camera, ease of use and the function range available.

First, let me address the ease of use.  After switching on the on/off button you have 3 modes to select from via a dial setting: picture review mode (allowing you to view all pictures currently stored on your compact flash card), capture/picture taking mode and setup mode.  All modes allow you to choose many available options (I will address these later), if you choose to do so, by selecting from menus.  However, fabulous results can be obtained without selecting from various options this camera has to offer, allowing the user to snap a picture quickly.  Next, you can utilize the two zoom buttons to get up to 2 times closer to your subject (by using the telephoto option in the picture taking mode, you may use the digital mode to get up to 3 times closer to your subject).  After your options are selected you are ready to snap a picture which is immediately viewable on the lcd screen.  You are then given the option to delete your picture if you are not satisfied.  The picture is automatically stored on the flash card if you do not chose to delete.  Many other digital cameras on the market are not novice friendly and require several settings before you are ready to snap your favorite subject. 

Within the Capture Mode, the following menu options are available:  light exposure compensation (controling the amount of light allowed into the camera), white balance (correcting the amount of white desired in the picture in different light settings), color mode (controlling color tones), quality (picture resolution), exposure metering (the amount of light entering the lens) ,sharpness (highlight or blend of the edges of the subject), ISO speed (camera's sensitivity to light), shutter speed and date and time stamp. In the capture mode, a menu button is pressed to pull up the menu for these options and the user uses an up and down arrow to scroll through the options and choose the settings.

Within the Review Mode, the following menu options are available: magnify(zoom in on portions of the picture for viewing purposes), delete picture, protect (preventing special pictures from being deleted), slide show (displaying all pictures on the flash card in a slide show fashion), print order (used with a Kodak Personal Picture Maker printer) and picture information (displaying the date each picture was taken).  In the review mode also, a menu button is pressed to pull up the menu for these options and the user uses an up and down arrow to scroll through the options and choose the settings.

Within the Setup Mode, the following menu options are available: power save (allowing you to chose your balance of battery performance with camera performance), digital zoom (telephoto option), camera sounds (various camera function "beeps"), date/time set, video out(chosing the video out standard available in your area), language, format card (used to erase or format a corrupted compact flash card), reset user settings (reset to factory defaults) and about this camera (displaying name and model of your camera).  Again, a menu button is pressed to pull up the menu for these options and the user uses an up and down arrow to scroll through the options and choose the settings.

Software is included with this camera allowing you to upload, view and print your pictures from your Windows or Macintosh based computer.  Pictures can be uploaded directly from your camera via an included cord hooked to an available USB port on your computer or a Kodak Easy Share docking station can be purchased allowing the user to both easily upload pictures while also recharging the digital camera batteries simultaneously.  The Kodak Easy Share dock also requires a USB port for uploading capabilities.

As previously mentioned, pictures taken by your camera are stored on a compact flash card inserted in the side of the camera.  Included with your purchase is a 16 MB card.  Additional flash cards can be purchased in various storeage sizes to allow for an unlimited amount of pictures to be taken.  This camera requires two AA lithium batteries (included with your purchase are two non-rechargeable).  Rechargeable batteries can be purchased allowing you to use both the Kodak Easy Share Camera Dock or a Kodak battery recharger, extending the life of your batteries.  Also included with your purchase is a 95 page user's guide that is simple to understand and quite informative.  Kodak also offers additional support through a web address, fax customer support number and telephone customer support number.
