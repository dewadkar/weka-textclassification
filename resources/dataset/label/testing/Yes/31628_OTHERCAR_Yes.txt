            This is my second digital camera. My first was a very BASIC camera and I wanted to upgrade to some major megapixels. I shopped around for several weeks and decided to go with the reviews from Megapixel.net. I had a specific price range and wanted something with at least 2 megapixels. Nikon is one of the most respected names in cameras so I knew I couldn't go wrong here. The camera takes some outstanding photos with many options I have yet to use. The only gripe I might have is that the flash is sometimes weak and there is no external mount for an additional flash unit. Also a word of advice with digital cams, buy rechargeable batteries!!!<br><br>
