            Purchased the camera based on excellent reviews received and the NIKON name.  Camera is very easy to use and comes with a complete users manual (on CD).  It would have been nice to have this manual included in the box.

Camera produces professional looking photos by just following easy directions.


Very happy with the camera except for a few minor things.



1..Camera is not Twain compliant - making it impossible to download pictures directly from the camera to most photo editing software.

2..Rechargeable batteries are must.  Normal alkaline batteries have a very short life span.

3..Camera does not come with a AC power supply.  This would be handy when working indoors and would save on the batteries.

4..As with most digital cameras the LCD panel is difficult to see in the sunlight.  Nikon does not make a &quot;sunshade option&quot;.  The camera does come with a viewfinder which helps in sunny situations.

Very happy with quality of photos taken so far.  
It is a very easy camera to work with.<br><br>
