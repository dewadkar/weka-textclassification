            We purchased a '95 Elantra 4 door when I became pregnant with my first child.  It wasn't what I wanted, (I like big trucks) but it was what we could afford, and suited our needs.  It doesn't have a lot of power, but it gets great gas mileage.  We have a stick shift, and that has helped I am sure.  We have had our first set of problems just this past year, when we had  a few minor repairs, but it has been low maintenance for us.  It is low thrills and frills, but so far I have really enjoyed owning it.  

Thought the Elantra isn't the smoothest most comfortable ride in town, we have made several long trips with our two children with few complaints.  The trunk space is enough for our s suitcases, duffle bags, and my sewing machine..(can't travel without that!)

The bad part, is that yes, the parts are imported and very hard to find, and when you do they are at a dealership and very expensive.  We needed a rim one time and it cost 125.00 for just one!  We have since found the key- call a salvage yard, and ask if any cars like your are there- they will take the part off you need, and sometimes install it.  That saved me 85.00 when I needed a rear tail light cover after an accident.

All in all, I have to say the Elantra has been good to us, and would be great for a small family on a budget.<br><br>
