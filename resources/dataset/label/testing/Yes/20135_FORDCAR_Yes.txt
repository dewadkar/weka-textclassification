            Need a seven passenger vehicle that also has plenty of cargo space, drives like a car, and offers a comfortable ride? Then look no further than the Ford Windstar. 

My wife and I have owned a minivan since 1992. When our Plymouth Voyager began to die on us (at 125,000 miles), we began our search for a new minivan in earnest. We had enjoyed our Plymouth greatly and so began our search with Plymouth and Dodge products. 

The one thing we had always disliked about the Plymouth/Dodge minivans was the lack of cargo space behind the rear seat. So we began our search this time by looking at the Grand Caravan to get more room. We were terrible shocked at how much more money the Grand Caravan cost over the regular Caravan. So we did a computer search of new minivans and compared their cargo space. We were surprised to learn that the Windstar came standard with the largest cargo space in the industry--even more than the Grand Caravan. This led us to take a test drive.

The test drive was a delight. The Windstar has a wide wheel base, so it seems very stable. It has good acceleration and rides very comfortably. We test drove other vehicles, but bought the Windstar.

The one thing that has taken the most trouble getting used to is figuring out just where the front end ends. We have bumped it gently a few times in learning. 

My wife, who loved her Voyager, can't say enough about the Windstar. She quickly adjusted to the car and really likes its standard features. 

Our only concern is the lack of fuel economy. The Windstar's engine drinks fuel like a teenager going through milk. I appreciate the power, but wish that it did better than 17 in City and 20 on the highway. But that is a small price to pay.

If you are looking for an affordable car with many conveniences included at no extra cost and with the cargo room to haul a family and all its luggage, the Windstar may be for you<br><br>
