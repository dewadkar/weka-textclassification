            I bought my ZX2 Sport in September of 1998 after graduating from college.  I have to say that Ford gave me a terrific deal.  I got all the bells and whistles included at still got he car for under 13 thousand.

I love the fact that it has a sleek and sporty look to it without the sports car price.  It has lots of leg room for a taller person.  I am 5'9&quot; and can drive comfortable even with someone riding behind me.

I have gotten terrific gas mileage.  I drive into Washington DC every day in very heavy traffic (stop and go is putting it mildly) and still get at least 25 miles to gallon.  I have gotten almost 35 on road trips.  The only scary part is when I got 12.5 gallons of gas into the 12 gallon tank without the gas needle being plastered past the empty line.

One feature that really lacks in the 1998 model is the truck release.  You have to use the key or the remote FAB control (but the car must be turned off).  The 1999 model has a truck release, but it is located in the glove box and if you are like most people that I know, the glove box is already packed full.

The only major problem that I have had is the drivers window.  The car has been into the show four times for them to &quot;repair&quot; it.  I have heard everything from &quot;the part isn't in stock&quot; to &quot;it only needs a little lubricant in the window piston.&quot;  I spent three months waiting for Ford to correctly make one of the parts (it came in at least twice and didn't fit) when they finally decided that it only need more lubrication.

This would be a great car for the first time buyer because it is not overly expensive even with some extras and gets good mileage with low maintenance costs.

I won't recommend this car to someone who wants the typically sports car performance.  The only way you are going to compete with a true sports car is if you do some after market improvements.<br><br>
