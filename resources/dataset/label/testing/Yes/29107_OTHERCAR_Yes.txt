            Let's get the complaints out of the way so we can focus on the important stuff. This truck needs a bigger gas tank and a real horn. With the V6, an automatic transmission and an air-scooping pickup bed, 17 gallons of gas don't take you very far. Even cruising on the highway, getting better than the EPA mileage estimate, you'll still find yourself filling up before you get past 300 miles. As for the horn, the wimpy tweet-tweet is just downright embarrassing.

That aside, there's not much I would change about this truck. The SR5-V6 package I've been driving for the past four months and 8000 miles has yet to disappoint.

The 3.4L V6 spits out ample power for a truck this size and best of all, lets the driver know with a throaty growl each time the accelerator dips past the halfway mark. Even fully laden with all your friend's worldly possessions, this truck moves and handles with confidence.

On the highway, passing power is adequate, though certainly not astounding. You are driving a pickup truck, after all, so put aside thoughts of racing if you plan on cruising in this machine. Even still, the top end is far and above the legal speed limit on any of our highways.

The suspension on this truck is the result of years of work by Toyota Racing Development. They're the folks who've been bringing Ivan &quot;Ironman&quot; Stewart to the finish line first in countless Baja, Desert, and Arena Truck races over the past fifteen years. And their work shows. Unlike earlier incarnations of the Toyota 4x4 truck, the new Tacoma comparably floats down the road.

Don't get me wrong, this is still a pickup truck. But with a more gradual suspension, the Tacoma soaks up many of the smaller bumps, even empty, that would leave your kidneys screaming mercy in most of the competition's offerings. Cornering and grip is about average for a 4x4 pickup, though the typical light rear end will allow you to spin the tires in gravel and rain.

Which is why Toyota gave us four wheel drive. The SR5 package comes complete with auto-locking hubs and shift on the fly 4WD. Toyota, much to my delight, still utilizes a floor mounted shift lever to engage all the wheels. Personally, I prefer the old mechanical lever in a work truck to the wimpy little dash mounted pushbuttons. There're no vacuum hoses to break or wires to fray. What you see is what you get.

Four wheel mode engages effortlessly at any speed below 35mph with a simple pull of the lever. If you're really hitting the rough stuff, the Tacoma comes with 4-Lo, and as an option, a manually locking rear differential. Bogged down in wet sand or mud, the rear locker binds the rear wheels together and will push you through most anything. If you actually manage to get this truck stuck, you're simply trying too hard.

Inside, the truck is comfortable and clean. The view is high and uncluttered with any blind spots being easily negated by the large sideview mirrors. The seats are supportive and comfortable for my 160lb frame, though I expect a much heavier driver would find them lacking after an all day spin at the wheel.

Before purchasing this Tacoma, I test drove most everything in the category. For overall build quality, power, and ride comfort, the Tacoma came out the hands down winner over the closest competitors.<br><br>
