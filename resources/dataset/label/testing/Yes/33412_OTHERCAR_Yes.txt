            The all new A-4 Jetta is a true German Car. Compared with the A-3 bodystyle the new body design is a refreshing change and sticks out amongst the hoards of Japanese imports. Not only has the exterior been revamped but now the interior has an &quot;audiesque&quot; appeal. All controls are were they are suppose to be and the new VW line up features the &quot;Cool Blue&quot;instrument lighting.  The interior is well laid out with supportive seats up front however could be a little cramped for tall adults in the back. The stereo comes with 8 speakers and is very good.  I now have close to 10 thousand miles on my car and have noticed several minor annoyances.  Being an individual who likes to perform minor maintenance on my cars I found it odd that the owners manual was telling me to take the car to the dealer to change a minor thing like a headlight bulb.  After looking at the  unit I can understand why!   I also expected to get better gas mileage but only manage to get 300 mpg.  The interior has also started to experience minor squeaks.  Overall the new jetta is great starter car for those of you that want German engineering but I recommend buying a year 2000.<br><br>
