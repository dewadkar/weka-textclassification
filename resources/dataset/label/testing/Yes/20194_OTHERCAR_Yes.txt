            <i>Keep in mind when reading that this review is by no means complete.  No review of one auto can truly be finished until the automobile lies in a scrap heap in a junkyard.  Updates to this review may be added sporadically.</i>    

I bought a 1999 Chevy Malibu back in August of 1999.  I have had no problems with the car in its 23,000 miles on the road in the past 13 months.  I do not think that is a major issue for a new car should not have any problems in the first couple years anyway.

<b>The good</b>

The 1999 Malibu is relatively quiet ride.  I have not heard any squeaks or any other mystery noises while driving it.  The engine is not very loud when idle.  Sometimes I forget that I already started the car because you cannot really hear it!

There are tons of cup holders in the 1999 Malibu.  If you have four people in the car, everyone will have a cup holder.  None of them have spilled drinks when I make some crazy turns and swerves.  That is a good.

The car is roomy.  There is plenty of room in the front and back seats of the car.  The trunk is very big as well.  The trunk is currently is about half full of junk (I'm too lazy to clean my car.  I throw stuff in the trunk.  Kind of like people who use their closet to clean their bedroom).  I like my room for my junk.

The gas mileage is decent.  I average about 28-32 mpg on the freeway.  I have no clue what I average in rush hour.  I'm usually to peeved to care while sitting in traffic.  The tank does not have to be filled up as often as my old Chevy Blazer which is a plus in these times of high gas prices.

The 1999 Malibu (V6) accelerates very well.  I'm not a car expert by any means, but I can tell you that it is better than most similar types of cars that I have driven in the past. 

(For the people who have snow in their area)  I had no problems driving on ice or in snow this past winter.  It is nice to have a safer feeling when driving in that type of hellish weather.  The anti-lock brakes work well when needed. 

<b>The bad</b>

I have no complaints about the 1999 Malibu.  However, I have had two problems since purchasing this car.  First, I get many comments that I drive an old person's car.  These types of comments are easy to brush off, but it still irks me.  Also, I have been rear-ended twice since getting a 1999 Malibu.  I never had been in any type of accident before getting this car.  Coincidence or pure madness?  You decide.

<b>Overall</b>

I enjoy driving this car.  I have no real complaints.  However, I do not think that I should be kissing this car's booty just yet.  Nothing should be wrong with it yet.

This review will be updated with accolades and dirty remarks as they surface during my continued use of the car...
