            We traded in a custom van for a 1993 Lumina Euro with 20,000 miles on it because we no longer needed to haul the kids around. The Lumina still gave us the room to carry extra people with some comfort. Overall this car has been dependable. 

We did have an oil leak at 90,000 miles, it was still under warranty, so the repair did not hurt our pocketbook. Replaced the alternator at about 100,000 miles and the usual, belts, plugs, hoses, and water pump a little later on. We still have the car with almost 170,000 miles on it. It is comfortable to go on long trips and gets up to 29 mpg highway and 25 mpg city. 

It handles good, but I could use a little more power from the 3.1. I feel the car is completely reliable for long trips and I think with the type of care we give the car we will get another 100,000 miles out of it or more. We have changed the oil regularly and serviced the transmission once.( changed the fluid and screen just for good measure) If you want a dependable family car with a little sporty look to, this one will work for you. If you want a get up and go sports car, don't choose the Lumina. I have enjoyed the car.<br><br>
