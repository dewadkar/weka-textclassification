            My son-in-law is like the guy in the Isuzu ad, he has a car for every day of the week. He's gotten 3 new cars since January. I'm serious.  He takes incredibly good care of his cars , as does his whole family-he is the guy to buy a second hand car from since he rarely keeps a car for more than a year.

When he bought his new Suburban we bought his old (I use the term loosely) Suburban. We bought out his lease at $21,000 with 38,000 miles on it.

We love it.  My husband is 6' I'm 5" and it works for both of us. The ride is nothing but luxurious. I love being the big guy on the road, it makes me feel incredibly safe, especially driving in Florida where the drivers are either old or insane of both. 

The size makes it a little difficult backing up but I use my hinged mirors (good thing they're hinged I popped mine hitting our Jeep backing up and everything was fine).I do not parallel park this car-haven't even tried.

It's an 8 passenger vehicle though we have the third bench stored at the moment but if you have a lot of children to transport this is another great feature. I like to garage sale so we leave the seat out, I want the extra room. There's 46 cubic feet of cargo room. Great for all the stuff I find.

Around town it gets 15 miles per gallon and has a 44 gallon fuel tank, you don't fill up very often.  It has great stability in wind.  Ours came with a CD and it's climate controlled, 2 zones.  It has 2 wheel drive (it's a Florida car).  It has automatic door locks, another nice safety option, Florida has problems with car jacking.

You get 315 horsepower, it weighs in at about 6360 lbs and it has a large center hump up front which our Chichuahua uses as his personal rest area.

Out of all the cars I've owned this is my favorite. We have a Durango home in New Jersey and I'm going to miss this car when we go home for the summer.   

The Suburban impressed my son-in-law enough that he upgraded to the newest model.  This is definately the SUV of choice as far as this family is concerned. I'd have a fleet of them if I could.
