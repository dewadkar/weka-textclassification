            This is a great camera. I actually bought it at egghead.com....go to the auction site and bid.....i saved $300!!!!!!! It sounds tough to do but it's really easy. The picture's look wonderful and print really good. The whole thing is idiot proof...just point and click. It's easy to delete pictures...there are three simple buttons on the back of the camera...up down and the fabulous &quot;Do it&quot; button, just scroll up and down on the menu and then choose what you want to do. You can even add borders to pictures as you take them or even create your own borders. The camera is very light and looks just like a regular camera but has a view screen at the rear along with the regular view finder. Make sure you get extra batteries though...they run out really quickly and maybe get the extra AC adaptor. All in all this is one of the best cameras i've ever used. But shop around the prices vary greatly.

Amazing camera...good price. get it get it get it.<br><br>
