            It took me a year to finally decided to take the plunge on the Olympus E-10. I read everything I could locate to be as well informed as possible when it came time to buy. 

First, let me say that I chose to buy from a camera shop. I know that I could have got a better price elsewhere but I did this for one reason... the ability to be very picky. This is why:

In reading about the E-10 I found one very significant problem come up frequently. The problem is Dead and Hot pixels in the CCD. There is a site on the internet which has a utility which will allow you to test for this. The first E-10 I took home had 2 very noticable hot pixels and 6 minorly noticeable. I took it back and explained what I had found.

Fortunately, the salesperson I dealt with the whole time also owns an E-10 and was very supportive. He traded that out for another E-10. I took it home and ran tests again. This one had 5 very noticable hot pixels and 12 moderately noticable. I called the store and told him about it. It so happened that a new one had just been delivered so I went to the store with a CF memory card and shot the test shots. I then took the card home and ran the tests. This time... compeltely clean.

Olympus is having difficulties with the hot and dead pixel issues. While I never encountered a dead pixel, I had lots of hot pixels in the tests. I mentioned that I went through a camera shop to allow leverage to be picky. Some might think that a dozen hot pixels in a field of ~4 million wouldn't matter but they indeed showed up very clearly in photos. Not good.

I also read everything I could about the use of Microdrives with the E-10. I discovered that most people had problems with the 1GB models. After a great deal of deliberation I decided to get 2 340MB Microdrives. Both worked absolutely perfectly and I am very happy with them.

My next step was battery life. I decided to take the hard hit and buy the Lithium-Polymer grip. This was very expensive but WELL worth the price. These batteries won't die! The Microdrives use an incredible amount of power. (Please don't attempt to use them with NiMH). I have shot 600+ pictures with the LiPo battery grip and the Microdrives. Only about 100 of these were with flash. I still have 50% of the battery pack left. I'm going to have to recharge at the end of the week for a big shoot. I wish I didn't have to because I'd like to see how far I can push them. 

I have now added the 1.45x telephoto and wide angle lenses to complete the set of optics I want to have. 

On the downside, I have found that the autofocus tends to wander in low light conditions.

Other than that I have had stunning results. I highly recommend the system. This camera is only for people who want complete control of shots and high quality pictures. If you want a point and shoot this one will be wasted on you. There's so much more when you get out of the Program mode. 

Be fully prepared for the price though. With the E-10, battery grip, 2 microdrives, 128MB Compact Flash card, two extra add-on lenses and the Tamrac Pack to put everything in, I now have well over $3000 in this camera. 

Also, take note that I purchased a 2 year extended warranty for this camera from Olympus. Something this expensive was worth the $89.
