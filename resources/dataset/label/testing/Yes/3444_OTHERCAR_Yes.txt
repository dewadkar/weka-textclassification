            I own an Acura 3.2CL Type S and I'm everyday thankful.  When I wake up, I go to my window and look at it for 30 seconds or so and I can't wait to go to work just for the ride.  Okay, that may sound a bit exaggerated but I chose that car very carefully and I wouldn't want another. 

I had an Acura Integra GS before and being tired of being outrunned by Cavalier Z24'S I decided to go for a change.  I saw many other great cars like the Lexus IS 300, a car where you need a focus group to tell you if the interior is good looking or not.  I saw a BMW 325ci.  For my price range I got less performance and as much standard equipment as a Jetta.
I also saw Audi's A4, Volvo's C70 and many more.

I finally chose the Type-S.  For it's performance, standard equipment, comfort and quite frankly, I liked the chrome shifter grill and the stick with the little red "S" on it.  
Quite nice :)
I wasn't sure about the automatic, being a supporter of manual for years.  I felt like if I was changing religions.  And although the styling appealed to me, I thought it was a bit bland.  So I chose the black one with tinted windows and spoiler to make it look as sport as possible.

Well, I was wrong.  The look works a lot to my surprise.  Many people stare at it, point at it.  One week after buying the car, I had to storm out of a McDonald to run after kids who were all around it checking the tires and looking in it.
I have people on the highway coming besides me and gesturing me to show them what it can do.
I have people coming to me while I'm fueling it and asking me how much power it got.  Total surprise for me.  

First of all, performance.  this car goes from 0-60 in 6.6 seconds.  More than enough to have that Cavalier Z-24 disappearing in your rearview mirror so fast, you'll think it went away in reverse.
It's not that fast from the start.  All the weight of the car needs some time to really get into motion but when it starts going speed builds quickly and the only thing that can stop it are the screams from your wife besides you, menacing to divorce if you don't slow down.

As for passing power, there's plenty also.  When going 70mph on the highway, slam the pedal to the floor and you'll instantly be transported to speeds over 110.
If you keep on going you can go up to 147.  At that speed you can wave goodbye to all those BMWs and Mercedes locked at 130.

The transmission is a 5-speed automatic with a manumatic mode. Which means you can almost drive it as a manual.
First gear and second stays automatic. And it's perfect that way. The rest is fully up to you.  It will never force you to upshift.  Even with the needle slamming on the rev-limiter at 7000rpm, it will stay on the gear you have selected.
The downshifts though will not take place if it could damage the engine and when you get under about 10mph it goes back to first.  So you don't have to downshift all the way down all the time.

Inside, you'll find everything you need and even many things you don't need but that are always fun to show off to people.
You have nice perforated leather seats with electric controls and heated too.  Automatic climate control.  Side air bags, although I didn't test those yet.  Heated mirrors.  6 in-dash cd changer.  The right-side mirror tilts down when you go in reverse, perfect to help parallel park when you let your grand-ma drive.
And finally every other feature you would find in any car costing 10 grands more.

So I highly recommend this car to anyone wanting a lot of performance wrapped in luxury and that doesn't make people hate you because you have a BMW.
