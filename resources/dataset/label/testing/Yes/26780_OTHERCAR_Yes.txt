                 I am truly pleased with this automobile overall, so I must share.  My father purchased this car for himself several months ago and is pleased as punch by it, and so is the rest of the family.  We had all desired a SUV in the family, but we were worried about a bumpy ride and a gas guzzler.  Then we stumbled upon the brand new Vue and found the answer to our needs.  It's an SUV that has the size, ability to handle slick and bumpy roads, and the ability to haul what you need to with the help of the fold down back seat and the roof rack.  While it's also a car since it rides like a car on its car chassis, does not take as much gas and doesn't end up in 2 area codes (or 4 parking spots) like other SUVs.  Here is a break down for all of you needing the technical info.

~The Engine (vroom vroom)~
     We went with the V6 that has 181 horsepower and 195 foot-pounds of torque.  It has a really nice acceleration so you can get moving on the freeway and pass those Sunday drivers.  It only requires 87 octane gas so you can save a few cents and like I said before, it doesn't guzzle as much as other SUVs.

~All Wheel Drive and Brakes~
     The all wheel drive has really proven helpful in this early brutl Ohio winter.  If the front wheels slip, the control flows to the rear wheels to assure you don't slide into the ditch.  Although we have not officially taken it off-roading (we've been on some poorly taken care of alleys and gravel drives), but it handles it as well.  
     We also took the option of Anti-look brakes with Traction Control.  These brakes allow for another safety feature on slippery roads.  There is a sensing mechanism that determines when you do not have good traction, and the brakes gently pump automatically to prevent wheel lock (and a call to the tow truck).  

~Storage and Cargo~
     For everyday trip to the grocery store, a handle little fold up rear cargo organizer is included so your plastic bags are contained nicely to reduce spillage.  For hefty hauling, the rear and front passenger seat fold down for a maximum of eight feet of space and 63 cubic feet.  This really came in handy when I moved.  The rear seat does not completely lie flat, but it works out fine once you put some weight on it.  The roof storage rack worked out great when we hauled a couch on top for a 2 hour drive.  There are conveinant attachment points and cross bars.

    
     All and all this is a really nice automobile.  You can customize it as much as you like with extras such as a trailer hitch,  bike racks, ski/snowboard carrier, kayak/canoe attachments, surf/sailboard cushions, cargo cover, cargo net, front grille guard, side step bars and not to mention the different brake and engine features.  The back seat is not extremely comfortable.  The total upright position sits you too upright, while the more reclines position is too reclined.  We had some problems with the A/C not blowing cold enough, but the nice people at Saturn were able to help it out a bit.  The cusotmer service is wonderful.  No hassle or pressure.  You get invited to social funtions and get great service.  They make you feel like part of the family.  I am sure that the little problems such as the ones I have mentioned and the little road noise and bumps you hear will probably be fixed in the next few years.  Give it a shot, mate.  Cheers!
