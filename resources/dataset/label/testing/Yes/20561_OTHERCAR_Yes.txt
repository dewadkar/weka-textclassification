            I bought this car for its great looks and reliability.  Honestly, I'm a &quot;Made in America&quot; kind of guy, and I started out looking at the domestics, but in the end I chose what I thought to be the better car (my opinion, of course). Besides, there's just something about those sexy quad headlamps!

Love:  This car is just plain fun to drive: pretty impressive acceleration for a 4-cylinder (especially in 3rd gear around 38mph), great handling, very comfortable seats.

Hate:  I don't hate anything about the car.  There really isn't much room in the back seat, but if I cared about a back seat, I wouldn't have gotten a sport coupe.  One problem I do have is with changing the oil filter.  It's difficult to reach unless you access it from underneath.  I alternate between changing the oil myself and taking it to the garage where they use a bay (in other words, I only change the filter every other oil change, which is fine).

Although it's too soon to rave about reliability (car is only 1 year old), Honda has a great track record, so I'm expecting great things from this car. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty, reliable, great-looking car. I would probably NOT recommend this car to anyone over 6'2&quot;.  I am not quite 6'2&quot;, and I keep my front seat all the way back and slightly declined. It's comfortable for me to drive this way, but for any taller drivers who prefer to sit closer to the wheel, this might not be your car. One last note:  On the Edmund's website I read several posts where drivers complained of the road noise from inside the car. I've never had any problem with road noise, even on several different types of roads.

Happy driving!<br><br>
