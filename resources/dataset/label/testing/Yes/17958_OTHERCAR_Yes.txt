              The true versatility of the Jeep Wrangler Sahara (1998) makes it an excellent all around vehicle.  The Jeep has the capability of shift on the fly 4 wheel drive (below 55MPH,  don't blow a transmission),  excellent power (4.0 L) and a rugged exterior.  The Jeep Wrangler allows you to express yourself.  How many other vehicles have not only a hard and soft top,  but allow customization with Bikini Tops and Tonneau Covers.  The ability to &quot;dress&quot; your Jeep will ensure that you won't get bored with the look.
  This is my second Jeep.  The reason that I came back to the Jeep is the style.  I like to be high enough to see what is going on ahead of me on the road,  the ability to drive in any condition (snow, rain) and the versatility.  The Sahara edition Wrangler really takes the cake in the Jeep line.  It has the most comfortable seats,  the best options, and demonstrates the Jeep's standard abilities well.  I chose the Jeep Sahara for the color and interior options.  
  Despite being a comfortable vehicle,  the Jeep is not a luxury ride. It has no power locks.  The back seats can not recline.  There are no adjustments for heat or cold in the back and no window to open (however you can remove it!). The lack of security witha soft top doesn't allow the weak at heart to install a high quality stereo system,  but the stock system does meet basic needs.  

  All around,  the Jeep Wrangler is an excellent vehicle.  While it may not have the space needed for a family,  the Wrangler does have the space and ability to meet the needs of the sportsman.  With its small turning radius and 4 WD,  the Wrangler is quite successful in all types of terrain.  The Wrangler is also a comfortable vehicle for long drives.  It is high enough that you can see the road easily.  It also has the power to accelerate and maintain sustained highway speeds.  I would recommend this vehicle to people who like style and the ability to go anywhere.
