            I guess you can say I'm more of a car guy than a truck guy. I really don't see the reason to drive around in a big clumsy truck when you can be driving in a nice sports sedan or roadster. But a good friend of mine really wanted me to try out his '97 Explorer so I did.

Powertrain: A+

This Explorer, an XLT model had the then new 4.0 liter SOHC six cylinder. Rated at 210 horsepower, it moved the heavy truck with ease, and it was so smooth and quiet! The FIVE SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION was quite smooth. Most SUVS do not come with an automatic transmission with five gears! Fuel mileage in a vehicle like this is going to be bad. My friend says he gets about 15 MPG. There are worse, but that's not a good number.

Interior: A+

   Ford has really done its homework here. Good quality plastics surround an attractive and comfortable enivironment. Well designed controls and easy to read displays may even make driving with the cell phone safer...ok maybe you should just get a Plantronics headset!). The seats are very comfy, but the headrests in the rear seat dig into my upper back, a bad design! The Explorer has tons or cargo room, perfect for a camping trip. The large windows allow for superb visibility.

Steering/Handling: B-

  The Explorer is no Honda S2000, but it handles very well for an SUV. the steering is direct and the body leans less than in other SUV's I've driven such as the Mitsubishi Montero Sport. The brakes work extreamly well but have a mushy feel to them. Although it is improved over the 1992 Explorer I drove once. If buying one, make sure it has had the tires replaced due to the massive Firstone recall.

Overall: A-

  Like i said, I don't like SUV's, but this Explorer could change my mind. It does everything well, better than in some cars I've driven.it even has the government's 5 star safety record! If you must get an SUV, you owe it to yourself to look at this. And according to recent sales you probably have one already or are planning to buy one. The Explorer is one of the best choices out there. Just ask your dealer for some Goodyears!<br><br>
