            I recently bought a new Mercedes-benz S430 Standard (or short) wheelbase sedan as a replacement for my Lincoln LS V8 whose lease just ended. (It is unfortunate, however, that the short wheelbase version of this sedan is not offered in the U.S., whereas it is here in Canada where I live. Also, as a consequence of this, the price I quoted is a conversion of the purchase price of my car before applicable taxes and other stipulations. I used the $1.45 Canadian=$1 U.S.) And as I have noticed, the change from the Lincoln to the Benz is a big one. I like the Lincoln a lot, but this offered another level of luxury that I haven't appreciated before. First of all, I can start with the seats, I ordered up the special "multicontour ventilated seats" which adjust perfectly to the contours of my back, and is heated as well as cooled. And what legroom! I'm over 6'8" tall a woman, and never before have I had so much freedom of my legs and the adjustable seats offer unparalleled ways of adjustments. 
Here are some of the other features which I added to came with my car as standard options:
Integrated cell phone: allows hands-free operation and voice-recognition dialing--very convenient for using on the road
6-disc CD changer
Electric rear sunshade and side shades: very useful for my rear passengers during unbearable sunny days
Rear heated seats
Door and trunk closer assists: this is truly amazing, the doors and trunk can, if need be, close by themselves! I sometimes play around with this feature.
Parktronic: this is very common now, and is very useful when I have to park this still relatively large car in tight spaces.
Distronic: now this is more exclusive, it's an intelligent cruise control that monitors my car's distance compared to other cars and applies braking power if necessary
Active Body Control: thanks to this option, even a car of this size exhibits little or no body roll on sharp turns. 

However, although I would agree for this car as being the nearest so far to approach perfection for any automobile, there are still some few quirks that I should mention:
Back seats are not very roomy, since I tend to move my seat very far back and I ordered the short wheelbase version. However, I'm sure this problem is not present in the long wheelbase version.
The center console; although I managed to learn all the buttons shortly after purchase, they still seem complicated and even intimidating to technophobes. But with the techno-magic they can do, I'm sure it's well worth the time in spending in learning these gizmos.
The price; I believe this car is well worth the price. But the price is still quite a bit high especially against the likes of the Lexus LS430 and such.

But all in all, the car's gorgeous looks (especially enhanced by the AMG sport package) and wonderfully crafted interior are reasons enough to love this car. But add Mercedes' reputation for reliability, safety and prestige, this car's price seem justified. After all, this is Mercedes' flagship sedan--the star of the three-pointed star.
