            We started looking for a new vehicle, when our 1990 Acclaim started smoking and burning about a quart of oil a week. The repairs would have cost more than the car was worth, so we started our search.There are only 3 of us, so we didn't need anything big. We were looking at compact cars when we came upon the Contour it was the perfect size for us.

We have  a 4 door sedan model GL 4 cylinder there is plenty of leg and head room, it will seat 4 comfortably 5 is a little tight. The gas mileage is great 20 to 25 miles city 25 to 30 highway. Don't let the 4 cylinder fool you there is plenty of power to pass safely and at a comfortable margin. It handles like a dream corners well with little resistance and drag on the steering wheel. The color is teal/blue with aluminum mag wheels and looks real sharp standing still or in motion.

There is really nothing I hate about this vehicle it has suited us to a tee.

This car is perfect for a small family who needs room and economy at a decent price. 

We have had our Contour for 2 years now and the only thing it has needed was new tires. It still runs as great today as when we bought it, never a problem.

I would highly recommend this vehicle.
