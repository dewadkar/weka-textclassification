            Before I purchased my Dodge Ram I had always wanted to own a truck.  Prior to my current career I was a Valet driver so I was able to drive in several different trucks.  No truck is as good looking, dependable, smooth, or as easy to maneuver as the Dodge Ram 1500.  In the 2 years I have had my Dodge, I have put 40,000 miles on it and have only been to the shop once to get the battery replaced.  This has by far been the best vehicle I have owned over my five previous Toyota 4x4, Ford Explorer, Jeep Wrangler, Bmw 325i, and Pontiac Firebird.  The gas mileage is pretty good too.  I absolutely recommend it to any consumer searching for the perfect truck.<br><br>
