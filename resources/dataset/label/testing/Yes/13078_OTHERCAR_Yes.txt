            This is my third digital camera I have bought from Sony.  The DSC V1 is a sharp silver 5 mega pixel DC that packs several features that will appeal to both the casual user and the expert.  I am a casual photographer, the V1 is the camera I wanted to improve my skills with.   This review will be from an average consumer standpoint. 
	
First of all, don&#146t get too intimated by the full set of features that the V1 offers.  Many of us just want a camera that can shoot beautiful photos on a whim.  The V1 is an easy camera to operate in auto mode.  Just set the dial to auto and off you go taking great shots.  If you do get this camera you owe it to yourself to try all the options the V1 can give you.  Plus it comes at a premium price, so you might as well get all that you can out of it.

There are several modes to shoot with:  auto, P (which is auto mode where you get more control), shutter, aperture, manual, and scenic.  There is a movie mode option that I found really nice, since you can keep filming continuously.  You are only hindered by the size of the memory stick (128 megs give you a little less than 6 min).  The LCD is fixed and doesn&#146t swivel like other models. An optical viewfinder sits to the top right of it.  The back view of the camera is very busy with several buttons, a jog dial, and zoom lever.  It has a hot shoe and yes I do have the HVL-F32X flash unit.  This is my second DC that has a Carl Zeiss lens (DSC S70).

The 4x optical zoom reaches its limits quickly so I bought the optional Sony telephoto lens which improves it.  I also bought the company wide angle lens for group shots.  The 4x digital zoom I don't really use, thats what Adobe is for.

What did I like?
The pictures&#133..the V1 takes great pics!  I mostly use auto or P mode, and the shots are beautiful!  I took an 8x10 photo of my sis, got rid of her acne thru Photoshop and bam!  It looked like a magazine cover.  Compared to my prior S70, images looked sharper and have better color with the V1.  At a minimum, a 256meg Memory Stick Pro is the storage media you want. I always shoot at the highest resolution so I need a large storage media.  I got the regular 128x2 stick (slow), because the store I bought the camera from didn&#146t have any Pro sticks in stock!(patience&#133patience)



The photo features are great options.  This is one flexible Sony.  I don&#146t know too much about white balance, ISO&#133etc.  But they are fun to play around with and easy to control.  Makes this camera a nice long term photo companion, and over time, once I learn more techniques I&#146ll appreciate it even more.

It&#146s fast.  The startup is almost instant.  Switching from all the different modes is instant.  Compared to the S70 (patience&#133patience) it is really fast.  The USB 2 connection makes for fast pc transfers.  I love this feature because as soon as I get home, I'm editing away with Adobe (patience!).

Hot Shot for an external flash is nice.  The built in flash is ok and it works well in dark areas.  But an external flash gives you way more flexibility:  nice softer images, better lighting, and no more red eye.  I've noticed that my pics have more "life" using the HVL-F32X.   

Size big reason I bought it over the F717/828 line.  I can take it any where.

Build quality appears to be good.  I'm confident that over time this DC will be durable.  The V1 could probably last longer than you would like to own it. 

What didn&#146t I like
Size&#133.the V1 is small.  It should be big enough to hold properly, they could have made it just a little smaller than the DSC S70, 75, 85 line.  The size makes it hard to hold (I&#146m still trying to get used to it). The size makes me worry about dropping it.  Definitely use the hand strap!  With the external flash mounted it's very top heavy.  The hot shoe mount doesn't feel that secure.  Like if your not carefull the flash could slide out.   An extra battery IS necessary, because this small DC eats a lot of juice! 
The location of the pop up flash is directly on top of where your left hand will be, so it takes some getting use to.  This is the main gripe.

Extras will dent your wallet!  The external flash, optional lens, extra battery, camera bag, a REAL memory stick (the 32meg that it comes with is a joke and preferably Mem Stick Pro)  and you can easily match the initial cost of the camera itself!
