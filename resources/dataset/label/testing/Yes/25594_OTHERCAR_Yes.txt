            With my lease on a 1995 Mitsubishi Galant nearing its end, I was looking for a more exciting replacement for an otherwise standard, but extremely reliable four door sedan (in four years all I had to replace was the battery). After briefly considering another Mitsubishi (test driving a Montero (too big), Montero Sport (too clumsy), Eclipse (sporty in a way I didn't enjoy) and another Galant (stifling a yawn)), I aimed my sights at something a little more upscale and fun. (And not without regret, as the entire experience I had with Mitsubishi products was nothing but positive. I guess I simply outgrew their lineup.)

After some considered thought and research I settled on some basic criteria: 1) needed more power for high-speed merging on the Washington-area's insane Beltway; 2) wanted improved handling, in particular a car that could hold a curve better at higher speeds and provide superior acceleration coming out of that curve; 3) and finally, something that was more fun, but still safe. 

I quickly narrowed my search to two choices: Volvo's new for 2000 S-40, and Saab's newly redesigned 9-3 coupe. After testing the Volvo at two different locations and was more than impressed with both its acceleration and handling (The S-40 only comes with automatic transmission -- both of the versions I drove came with power everything, sunroof, leather interior and the sport package, see Volvo Web site for more details), and the interior was well designed with all controls and indicators clearly marked and within easy reach. Unfortunately, while the exterior was a radical departure from the design I traditionally associated with Volvo, I wasn't nearly as taken with it as the Saab. 

Saab makes no secret of the fact that it also manufacturers fighter jets, and in profile, the 9-3 Coupe three-door echoes that sort of design. On the inside, the Saab matched the Volvo feature for feature, with superior handling, more than enough power for me (185-hp engine with an automatic transmission), and, after incentives, a better bottom line price than the Volvo. Throw in the superior Saab leasing terms (which provide an even better deal for the 9-3 five door), and that clinched the deal. 

Three months and 5,000 miles later, I couldn't be happier. With the extra power and improved handling, the car enables me to better avoid and escape trouble on Washington's notorious Capital Beltway. I've taken two trips of 250 miles and more in the car (DC to Martinsville, Va. and DC to Foxboro, Ma.), and can't wait for the drive back home to Long Island this Xmas. 

Now for the downside. While I love the extra cargo room I have with the hatchback, I had forgotten about the blind spot this configuration can create (a problem the car shares with the 9-3 convertible). This is partially offset by a convex side view mirror on the passenger side, but it does take some getting used to. 

While I'm happy not to be confused with young fathers on the road anymore (hey Eric, why isn't there a baby seat in the back seat of the car?), I sometimes miss the extra two doors and roomy back seat of my Galant, especially when hauling colleagues to business lunches or shuttling friends on the weekends. The rear seat is cramped, and can be slightly uncomfortable while seating two average-sized adults. 

Other minor annoyances include: a motorized radio antenna that doesn't always retract (a real nuisance at the car wash); a climate control system that inexplicably went on the fritz in the middle of a long road trip; and an in-dash CD player that seems prone to skipping -- a problem I'm told by others is more pronounced with the optional changer that's mounted in the trunk. One last quibble -- mounting a cup holder right in front of the CD player might not have been the best design decision, and it seems as if a better spot might have been found for it. 

Despite these minor nits, I'm a very happy Saab owner, and can easily see myself buying this 9-3 when the lease runs out, or moving to another model. I have a 35 minute commute every morning, and the Saab actually makes me look forward to the drive. I never thought I could have this much fun behind the wheel. <br><br>
