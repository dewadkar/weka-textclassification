            Can you believe the resolution of 1600x1200 let you take with this Sony FD95 camera pictures likely to a reflex camera in a simple floppy diskette, and then see in your own computer your masters of photography.  Letï¿½s see the digital technology is a piece of far away from reflex cameras. But this Sony FD95 is going to make you enjoy with the sport of shot any moving thing around you. One secret the Sony FD95 zoom is a Zoooom (10x optical, 20x digital). 

The funny part, the camera saves your shots in a floppy diskette, so you can insert your diskette in your computer and e-mail your pictures to your relatives, friends, or to the newsweek magazine, why not?.

The batteries run away very fast, well at least in my camera, like 50 shots at 1024x768 and the recharging system hook your camera for a while. Plus add the fact of only 15 seconds for video recording (note that the old FD91 allow you up to one minute of video recording, but because the smaller resolution). The audio receiver, in the front of the camera get a good Gain ratio, with a filter noise, and even you should not expect a home theater sound, the voices-in-a-box noises are avoided. Easy to use, is a perfect toy for the adult's spare time, ..., and for kids too. Also a tool for the business. The camera provides a feature to stamp the date and time. Useful to take pictures and then resend to your customers or services provider (a picture better than one thousand words!).

In the highest resolution you can save up to four pictures in a floppy (only?), so better if you carry a box of ten floppy diskettes. And hope in the next FDxx the people of Sony use that kind of 120 megabytes diskettes.

Well, excuse me but I should go to take some pictures ...... really enjoy with this camera!!!<br><br>
