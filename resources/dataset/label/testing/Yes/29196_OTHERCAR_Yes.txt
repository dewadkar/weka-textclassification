            I got my 1999 Neon Sport on April 4, 1999.  I was so excited about getting 
a new car.  I never really wanted a neon, but that's what my parents 
picked out to get for me.  I got it for graduation because my sister and I 
had been sharing a car since she was old enough to drive.  My best friend 
had a 1998 Neon and I had driven it some and it drove really good.  I 
really liked it.  When I saw the car that my parents planned in getting 
for me, I fell in love with it.  The only thing I don't really like about 
the vehicle is that they don't have the option of automatic locks and 
windows.  Those come in handy sometimes.  Other than that, I love it all!! 
I have had the car for just over a year and it has never been in the shop 
for any problems and I have put a number of miles on it driving back and 
forth from Alabama to Louisiana.  Some weekends I put over 800 miles on 
it.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  It is a fairly inexpensive car 
and you see them all over the place so they most be good cars.<br><br>
