            After years in my somewhat smallish Toyota SR-5 I decided it was time to upgrade to a full size pickup.  After dismissing the new Tundra for its halfway approach to a full size truck, I test drove all the American made full size pickups.  The GMC Sierra, and its counterpart the Chevy Silverado, appealed in both terms of price and features.  I finally selected a Sierra extended cab four wheel drive with the base 4.8 liter V-8.  Now, 4000 miles later, I am more than pleased with the decision.

Ride quality is by far the best of the available full size pickups on the market.  The interior is more like a luxury automobile than a truck and the suspension (towing package) provides a very soft and comfortable ride on the highways.  Noise levels are minimal, the power steering is speed sensitive and not over assisted on the highway and General Motors finally discovered brakes worthy of their trucks.

As an added bonus, fuel economy has been much better than expected although in line with the EPA estimates on the window sticker.  18MPG out of a full size pickup on the highway is excellent but even under a towing load of 3000lbs, economy is still 15MPG which is better than I could ever get towing with the Toyota.

I've experienced no problems and this has come as a surprise.  I guess I was somewhat pessimistic about American build quality but am happy to admit I was wrong.  Fit and finish are excellent and mechanically it is a reliable and responsive vehicle.  It appears, in the truck arena at least, that the American manufacturers have made tremendous strides in quality and can now deliver a vehicle that is equivalent to any of the imports.<br><br>
