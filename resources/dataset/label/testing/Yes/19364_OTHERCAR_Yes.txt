            I bought 1 '91 Metro LSI Convertible & 1 '92 Metro for only $600! We yanked the motor out of the '92 (The frame was cracked), dropped it into the '91 (The motor was blown), and I've been happily toolin' around in it for 8 months now. She has little get up & Go, but flys once it's revved up. The vinyl top is pathetic, the seems are busting, the rear window, which is factory glued into place,(has been repeatedly repaired with black duct tape!)is badly cracked and the window seals are ineffective to the elements of Kentucky's ever changing weather!  Yet, I still love this little car! I continue to surprise motorists by passing them, with my stereo blasting! It's a cheap gas expense, around $12 to fill her at dead empty, and can go around 200+ miles on one tank. There aren't many engine upgrades to be found, or accessories for the body that I'd like to find, but I'm still searching. This car is soo roomy, (I'm only 5'2, 130 lbs.) that I'm able to load just the front seat, passenger floorboard, and small back ledge with nearly 60 pizzas for delivery (Can you guess what I do for a living!?).
