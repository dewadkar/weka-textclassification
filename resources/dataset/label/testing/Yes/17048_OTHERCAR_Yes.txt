            This vehicle is built for everything all around.  It's an excellent change for a mini-van while it still gives the same amount of seats. The Durango rides well in all conditions considering that we live in Northern Michigan. The only thing I can find wrong with it is that it has the tendency to ride back in forth in lane.  The far back seat would not work well if you need to put kids back there between the ages twelve and up because it is kind-of small and there is not a lot of leg space.  Still with kids the ages 2,4,13,and 15 we all fit nicely in the Durango. We were one of the first families in town to get one and now they are all over the place!
