            This is the best car I ever had! I purchased this car because I was looking for a safe family car. 

I had a serious car accident about 6 months after I purchased the car.  The police were amazed at how well the car came out of it.  My insurance repair the car, through a shop recommended by Saturn and have never had a problem since.

I have over 80,000 miles on it and have NEVER need a major repair.  It has never let me down.

There is nothing I dislike about this car, and believe me I am very critical of cars.

Driving this vehicle is very enjoyable. The interior is comfortable and easy to clean.

I would highly recommend this vehicle to everyone, especially middle class families.  The saftey features and price on this car makes it ideal!<br><br>
