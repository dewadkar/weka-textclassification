            I purchased my Argus DC3550 Digital Camera in February 2003 and I have been pleased with it so far.  I recently took it on a trip to Williamsburg, Virginia, and I was generally pleased with how my photos turned out.

COST:
I paid about $150 for this camera, which I think is a great buy.  Most cameras with 2.1 megapixels and 3x optical, 2x digital zoom cost around $200, and sometimes even more.  I purchased my camera at Office Max.  Their regular price was $249.99, but it was on sale when I bought it, and the $150 price included a free 32 mb Compact Flash memory card.

BATTERY LIFE:
This camera uses 4 AA batteries.  I have found that the battery life is fairly good, as long as I use a good brand of batteries.  I have noticed that Duracell rechargeable batteries work best.  A package of 4 of these can be purchased at Wal-Mart for about $10.  I definitely recommend using rechargeable batteries.

WHAT I LIKE:
My Argus camera is good for what I use it for--family events and vacations.  I am not a professional photographer, but I do have some interest in photography.  I have found this camera to be good for general picture-taking.  The pictures are nearly equal to 35 mm pictures in 4 x 6 inch size.  I haven't tried to enlarge any of the pictures I have taken, but I'm sure the resolution would decrease.  On the digital 4 x 6 inch prints, I have to hold the picture real close to notice that it was taken on a digital camera.  Otherwise, it looks just like a regular picture.  
There are five white balance settings to choose from: automatic, full sun, cloudy conditions, indoors, and fluorescent lighting.  
The menu can be read in English, French, or Spanish, and the instruction booklet is split into three sections--one for each language.
The camera came with a plastic lens cap that seems like it would break easily, but so far mine has not, and it keeps the lens from getting scratched.  Also, the camera came with a nice little zip bag that can attach to one's belt.  This also helps to protect the camera from the elements when it's not in use.
Lastly, I like how you can look at your pictures on a TV screen.  You can have the camera do an automatic slide show, or you can flip through the photos at your own pace.  Looking at them on TV is much better than looking at them in the LCD screen, too.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE:
As with many digital cameras, indoor pictures often don't turn out as well as ones taken outdoors.  To combat dark indoor pictures, Argus has built in a function that brightens or darkens an image before you take the picture.  I have found this to be helpful when I have to take a quick picture.  You can actually see the image brightening up in the LCD screen.  
When I was in Williamsburg, I found it difficult to switch back and forth from one white balance setting to another, as it takes a few seconds to get to the menu and then press the "down" button to get to white balance.  
I mentioned above about the little carrying bag that comes with the camera--yes I like it, but the camera is too heavy to clip on to my belt.  In fact, I tried this in Williamsburg, and my shorts nearly hit the floor!
The instruction booklet is not much help if you've never used a digital camera before.  It really assumes that you know what different buttons and functions do.  It's real good at telling you "where" everything is on the camera, but doesn't do a good job explaining "what" it is.
My last complaint...the LCD screen doesn't work too well outdoors, as it is very difficult to see.  You might as well turn the LCD off and look through the viewfinder to save battery life.

AN ADDITIONAL NOTE:
I have found that walmart.com has great prices on processing digital photos.  They are 24 cents per photo, which is about half the cost of many online digital photo developing sites.  You just upload your photos to the website, and you can have them mailed to your house with a small shipping fee, or pick them up at your nearest Wal-Mart to avoid the shipping cost.
Also, the camera came with photo editing software, which I rarely use for two reasons: 1) it is somewhat complicated, and 2) I am more familiar with Adobe Photoshop, so I just use that instead.
Lastly, if you need help with your Argus camera, don't count on any help from their website, www.arguscamera.com.  I filled out the online form and sent an e-mail with a question that I had about my camera, and I have not heard any response.  Also, they don't have an 800 number.  So, I used the web features to avoid the long distance charges, but I guess if I ever have a severe problem, I will have to call the phone number and hope that someone answers!
