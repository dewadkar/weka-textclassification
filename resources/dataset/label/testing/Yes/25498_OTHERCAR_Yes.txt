Shopping for a second car for my (10 mile) commute to work and longer road trips with the family, we had a few criteria that the base Saturn sedan (http://www.saturn.com/) fit perfectly.  Minimal expected cost over 5 years,  ability to seat us 4 plus a guest comfortably,  adequate luggage space, good safety record all made a good combination. On the cost front the high resale value of Saturns makes a big difference (if we were ever to sell)  - also the gas mileage with standard transmission is excellent (who knows, gas prices may go way up in the next few years).  Pluses were the excellent air-conditioning (it's worked really well in the recent 102 degree heat wave here) and the plastic side-body panels that already survived being backed into by our Taurus with absolutely no damage. The only minus is that we didn't pay for power steering, which my wife misses. Also, the seats in this model (the 1998 base sedan)  get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of driving. The Saturn &quot;culture&quot; is kind of hokey - we've been eligible for tickets to local baseball games but haven't exactly felt the urge, and we never did get our picture taken with our salesman.  And you can't negotiate prices - but that's fine with me I hate negotiating anything.<p>
