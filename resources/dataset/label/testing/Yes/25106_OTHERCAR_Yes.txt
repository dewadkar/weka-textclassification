            I love my Hyundai Accent Gt. I think that the accent is one of the best cars that actually look decent that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. It has many different features such as: TDS ( Theft Deterrent System) this is a system that allows you to take a special key out of an ignition located under the steering wheel which shuts off the gas line. The car can only be started with this key in place. 

It has Child Protector door locks, height adjustment for seat belt's, and airbags on both the driver and passenger side of the car. It has two Child Restraint Hook holder nuts in the back-seat. It also has a sunroof that can be both raised or removed completely. It has front fog lights and an overdrive switch. 

Driving this car is very simple. It does good in the rain but in the snow, that's another story. You just to take it a little slower than normal. It gets very good gas mileage and only costs about $15 for fill up. Overall this car has been a great choice. Even though I did not buy it myself I am glad my parents bought it for me.<br><br>
