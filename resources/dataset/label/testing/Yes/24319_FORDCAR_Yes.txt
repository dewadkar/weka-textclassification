            I bought the 1994 Escort for less than $10k out the door. To date, it has 140k miles on it. The car has never been back to the dealership since I drove it away. It replaced the unreliable 1981 Buick Skylark competently.

I like the compact exterior of the car, especially when I need to park on the street in San Francisco. However, the interior room is respectable. This is especially true for short people like myself. The hatchback is very helpful to load large items. My only complaint is the high liftover height of the trunk compared to the sedan and wagon models.

Gas mileage of this car is exceptional. I used to get 39 miles per gallon when the car was relatively new. This is better than the EPA estimate! These day, I only get about 35 to 36 miles per gallon. 

The 1.9L basic engine is rated at 88hp. The Escort is no sports car, but it gets around nicely. Mine is a 5 speed, so it is easier to push the performance a little. The car feels significantly more sluggish when the AC is on. I usually switch the AC off when starting from a stop.

The suspension is not stiff, but a lot of road noise enters the cabin. Engine noise is reasonable. Cornering is okay but not particularly crisp. There was no antilock brake options in 1994, a major omitted safety feature.

The interior design is not particularly stylish, but it is functional. Most controls are easily accessible. All indicators and gauges are very easy to read on the dashboard. The all button radio/cassette would be easier to operate with dials for volume and tuning.

This particular Escort is very reliable. I change oil and filter every 5k miles (mostly highway), spark plugs every 12,000 miles. Radiator coolant and transmission oil are changed very 60,000 miles. So far, the only problem was with the spark plug cables (replaced for less than $20).

The resale value of Escorts is not very good. This makes used Escorts cost effective alternatives for college students and anyone who needs inexpensive but reliable basic transportation. Tall and big people may not like the limited interior room, however.<br><br>
