            I was extremely satisfied with my 94 Pontiac Sunbird.  I had it from 1995 to summer of 2002.  I had it during my teeanage years and it took the abuse I gave it really well.  It is a very easy car to drive.  It has got more power and acceleration than you'd think with a 4 cylinder.  I have also driven a 4 cylinder 1994 Chevy Cavalier (looks the same as a Sunbird almost) and the Cavalier doesn't even compare.  Everything about the Sunbird is nicer and better, especially the acceleration.  I had to have it repaired a few times, but not excessively.  At around 100,000 miles, the starter was replaced and at about 105,000 the radiator needed to be replaced.  That was about it for anything major needing repairing in the 7 years that I owned the car.  A couple minor repairs were done along the way but they were real cheap to fix.  It got awesome gas mileage.  I sold it in summer of 2002 and got a '99 Olds Intrigue.  I really miss the easy driving and handling of the Sunbird.  I regret not hanging onto it for a second car. My only complaint is that after 7 years, it got pretty rusty on the front driver and passenger side doors.  However, part of that was probably my fault as I rarely washed it and it was never garaged during the rough winters - I live in Minnesota.
