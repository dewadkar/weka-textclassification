            My background in photography is as an amateur for the past 30 years using Canon SLR equipment. 
I did a lot of research on Digital Camera's before I settled for the DC-280. At 2.3m pixels all digital camera give you about the same quality of pictures. At this level you are approaching 35mm results in some cases. So why did I pick this camera. 20mb of memory comes with it. I have tried taking picture at the highest resolution and at standard resolution and the quality is not much different. What this comes down to is the number of picture you can take with the memory you have on the camera. In my case I can get over 80 pictures before I need to download and erase what I have on the camera. 
Anyone interested in getting a digital camera should now only consider one in the above 2m pixel range. I had looked at digital cameras only a year ago and for this price range you could only get something in the 1m pixel range. The quality of the pictures were not good enough for me at the 1m pixel level. 
The selling points for the Kodak were the name, the memory that came with it, the controls on the camera, USB capable to download pictures and the price vs other of this class. I also purchased the dc power supply as an option, which is a must. If you are working with the pictures on the camera and downloading you can go through batteries pretty quick. I also bought the lens adaptor but I have not as yet used it. Bad point- Low light capability.<br><br>
