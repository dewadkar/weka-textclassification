            SS.

Thats a good way to start out.  This car goes far above and beyond the LS model Monte Carlo for the 2000 year.  I bought a white Monte Carlo SS in July and have had nothing but good experience with this vehicle.

To start, that handling for a car is better that average.  I'm not saying it is great, partially because my other car is a handling god.  The suspension is stiff enough to give a strong ride, yet soft enough to not be able to tell 90 from 120.  I have not topped out this car, but I can tell you that it is beautiful to fly down the freeway and 120mph.  Of course I have a BEL radar/laser detector.

This car has plenty of options to chose from.  I personally have chose them all.  From heated seats to power sunroof.  There is no reason to even desire more.  The sound system is definetly high quality, with the amplifier mounted stock in the trunk.

The performance has a little to desire.  The SS car should probably come with another 35 horses.  But hey, I am not complaining.  The big 2-door coupe has a respectable 0-60 time of about 6.8 seconds.  Top speed is unknown for me, but I have been cruizing about 120mph with plenty left on the tach.

Overall, the car is a great value.  It has the properties of an expensive luxury vehicle, while being quick as any two door coupe.  The outstanding syling is an added bonus and will complete the package.<br><br>
