            I just bought my 2000 BMW 323i a week ago, and it is everything I expected it to be and more.  

The 2.5 liter 6 cylinder engine provides plenty of speed for me (I am coming out of a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 6 cylinder).  Back in the day, pre-2000's, BMW would name their cars based on the model size, and then the engine.  For example, I used to have a BMW 318i convertible.  By looking at the "318" part of the name I could tell the car was a "3" series with a 1.8 liter engine.  Another example would be the BMW 750IL.  This is a "7" series car with a 5.0 liter engine.  Although the 2000 BMW is called the 323i, BMW started putting the 2.5 liter engine in the car.  The next year they did start calling this same car the 325i.

I purchased this car used with 38,000 miles on it, so I am still covered by BMW's 5 year/50,000 mile factory warranty.  I decided to buy used so I could save a few thousand dollars, but wanted to make sure that I was still covered under warranty for peace of mind.

My 323i came with the PREMIUM Package which includes: 8-way pwr front seats w/3-position memory feature for driver and passenger seat & exterior mirrors, auto-tilt-down of passenger side-view mirror when vehicle is shifted into reverse, auto-dimming rearview mirror, wind deflector, interior Myrtle wood trim, pwr tilt/slide glass moonroof w/1-touch operation, and 4-function on-board computer.  Mine also came with heated driver and passanger seats, a 6 disc CD Changer in the trunk, and 5-Speed automatic transmission with tap-up/tap-down Steptronic shift control.  The Steptronic shift control is a great feature, but not a must have.  It essentially lets you shift gears by moving the gear knob foward or backward, just like a manual, except no clutch.  Plus when you get bored of shifting, just flip the gear stick back to the right and your back to a full automatic transmission.  I have found the steptronic great for getting on the highway, or for passing slower traffic.

The interior styling is great, not too cluttered, and very functional.  Front passenger and driver room is great, but the back seat can be a bit cramped, especially if their is a tall person in the front.  This car has power everything; windows, locks, seats, and moonroof.  Although my model does not the HK premium stereo, the sound system is still very much above par.

The exterior styling, as with any vehicle, is a matter of personal choice.  I personally have been a long time BMW fan, and feel that they have achieved the goal of updating the 3 series looks for the new century, while keeping to the BMW tradition of performance, handling, and drive feel.
