            We bought a Ford Explorer in April of 96.  We wanted a vehicle that gave room to haul things, the power to get out and go, and some luxury of a nice car.  
Our Explorer was equipped a V-8 engine.  The engine has been a pleasant experience.  The mileage has been better than the same model equipped with a six cylinder engine.  On a trip up North, the mileage was from 20 to 23 mph.  It has always been around 18 mph with the air conditioner going and some city driving.
It was also equipped with leather seats, 6-play CD player, and a lot of extras.
The things we liked most about the car has been the durability of the engine and drive train.  We have about 140,000 miles on it and have had no major engine or drive train problems.  We have changed a seal in the real end and had the front brakes replaced.  Some of those miles have been over pretty rough country roads.
It is very comfortable for driver and passengers.  I am 6' 6&quot; tall and weigh about 240 and I can drive long distances without feeling cramped.
We have loaded all kinds of things in the back with the back seats down and find plenty of room.  
We purchased the vehicle with the towing package and it has worked very well.  The transmission has an overdrive, when towing we use the lower gears.  We have towed a full load of hay bales and have towed the horse and trailer with hardly any effort.  
Hardware in the cabin and the rough ride are two things we do not like.  The plastic hardware on the seats and the steering wheel have come loose. If there were more occasions of people in the back seat, we think there would have been problems with the hardware for the radio and heater.  All the gauges have been fine.
When you drive over an uneven road it can get pretty rough in the cabin.
Even with those two items, we will definitely consider purchasing another Explorer.
Our experience with the Explorer has encouraged us to consider Ford first when purchasing our next vehicle.
