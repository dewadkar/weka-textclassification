            This review is for the 2001 Dakota Quad Cab 4x4.  I purchased this new through CarsDirect.com.  This vehicle was equipped with the 4.7l engine which has power to spare and propels this big truck quickly when the foot goes down.  You'll pay for it, though, with a 16 mpg average (stop and go driving).  Highway miles will get you up to 19 mpg, but don't expect more than that.  I have also experienced pinging under load with 87 octane fuel, from several different brands of gasoline.  This seems troubling for a vehicle with 7,000 miles, but appears to be common with this engine.  The high-riding truck, with the suspension package, has a cushy and quiet ride, but make no mistake, you will remember that it is a truck when wallowing through corners.  The new paint seems to scratch easily and several 'fish eye' defects were found:  disappointing for a $30,000 vehicle.  The fuel pump also failed with less than 700 miles and replacement took three days.  The electronically controlled 4-wheel drive selector works quickly and flawlessly.  The wide-opening rear doors allow easy access to the sizable rear seat/cargo area, but a mysterious hump across the floor area hinders a steady placement for boxes or groceries.   The optional heated mirrors and rear window defroster work well.  Other options to consider are the hard locking tonneau cover, and the skid plate option, which is a necessity if you're planning to take this long-wheelbase rig off road.  The latter option does collect oil during changes, though.  You should also plan on new wiper blades, too.  The factory units were squeaky with poor wipe quality after 6 months.
