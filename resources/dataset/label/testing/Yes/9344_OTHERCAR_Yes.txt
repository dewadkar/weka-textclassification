               What can i say, this car is just awesome. It fits up to 8 people unlike most cars that fit only 5.  You could practically live in this car.  This car is a lot more luxurious then the regular Landcruiser, mainly because it's a Lexus.  You can get a lot of extra options with this car.  A couple of examples would be a cd player, a t.v., a Nintedo 64 system installed so you won't have trouble with your children.  The price is pretty reasonable considering it's a very safe car and is very smooth and has great handling so you're not likely to get in an accident.  It comes with a V8 witch is a great engine.      <br><br>
