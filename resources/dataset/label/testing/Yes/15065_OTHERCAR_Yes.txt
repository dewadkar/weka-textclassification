            We bought this camera to do online auctions but find it extremely easy for other things as well.  My wife &amp; I love to fish &amp; hunt.  Now we can capture our finest moments as they happen!  This camera was recommended by a friend...Thank goodness for friends like this!  Highly recommend for ease of use &amp; its many features.  My wife is disabled &amp; still finds this camera easy to use.  She can download &amp; install whatever she wants with it - even from her wheelchair!  I also enjoy its ease of use.  Our next purchase for this camera would be to purchase some of the optional equipment - such as lighting for indoor shots, etc..  We love the fact that we can view the shots as quickly as they are taken!<br><br>
