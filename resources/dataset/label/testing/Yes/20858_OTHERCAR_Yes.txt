            What a CUTE little car kind of a cross between a SUV and a car.  Wonder who the parents were?  It�s about time that a car manufacturer started thinking about unique and style again.  Ever get bored and watch the cars go by on the freeway and come to the realization that most of the cars seem cloned?

A down right stylish car that seats 5, well, 4 and a very small child in the middle of the backseat.  A150-horsepower 2.4L (148) DOHC SMPI 16 - VALVE L4 engine powers it rather nicely except it was a bit sluggish during passing with a couple passengers on board.  When we had people in the back it lost power.

The front suspension is MacPherson struts and in the bad is twist-beam axle supported by coil springs and Watt's linkage. Not the best cornering car around but does perform slightly above average. 

The leg room in the front is good and decent in the backseat.  There is plenty of headroom with the high body design.  The seats are comfortable and all the gauges, buttons and switches are all within easy reach.  The interior really did look nice, I was rather surprised.

After looking at Kia�s and other similar vehicles the PT Cruiser really stands out. The dashboard and instrument panel is a much better design.  The interior has a much �richer� look to it.  For a base price of around $15,935 it will certainly compete with like vehicles and appeal to a wide range of customers.  

Air conditioning is standard as is the real wiper and washer, removable 65/35 split-fold rear seat, 5-speed manual transmission, multi-position rear parcel shelf, front power windows and a one-piece lift gate.

I love the maneuverability of the cargo area.  The rear bench is removable to have plenty of cargo space.  One bad feature that I don�t like there is little cargo space without moving the back seat.  The back seat does have a handle to make moving it a bit easier.  To make the move a little mover easier still is the built in rollers.  

The gas mileage is fair with the manual transmission city 20 and highway 25 with a slight degree of difference in fact an usual difference with the automatic transmission at 20 and 26.  The fuel capacity is 15 gallons.  So it can go a bit of a distance on a tank of gas. By the way that automatic transmission will cost an extra $825.

Those fun options that jack of the price of a car, dramatically!  Of course I had to fall in love with the inferno red.  The dazzling pretty red with set you back a mere $200.00.  Will maybe I don�t like it THAT much!

Packages include a limited addiction package* ($4,685.00) and a quick order package* ($1,385.00).    For your convenience I will list the contents of both.   The touring package* cost $1,265.00 also listed for your convenience.  At first I felt the touring package was a big waste of hard earned cash but after driving a PT Cruiser with out the touring package and then driving one with the touring package there was a significant difference in handling.  The suspension was much firmer and cornered very nicely.  To bad there isn�t a bit more power to corner with!  The manual transmission seems to compensate some for the lack of acceleration that the automatic transmission had lacked.

The PT Cruiser is highly configurable with plenty of add- on options.  You have a choice between a reasonably priced four-door wagon and a fully loaded unique vehicle that is still turning heads.  A con may be that you can almost be guaranteed to pay full price since they are still a high demand vehicle.

The warranty will not make you stand up and shout with a bumper to bumper 3 year or 36,000 mile. The Corrosion warranty is 5 year or 100,000 mile.  They do offer free roadside assistance.


This brings us down to 	WHAT IS A PT CRUISER?  PT Cruiser (PT stands for personal Transportation).  Is it a four-door wagon?  Is it a SUV?  Technically it is a truck under federal fuel-economy regulations.  It handles like a car.  Practical like a mini-van.  Fun and usable like a sport-utility vehicle.  Ok, I�ll take the easy women�s way out, it�s a darn right cute, turn your head, and have fun car!  Make it what you want a expensive based priced stripped down model or fancy it up with lots of nice (and expensive options).  Affordable none the less and does appeal to a wide range of people.  A good value for the money spent even looking beyond the impish styling!

Now if we were to customize it just a little bit, maybe a turbo charged V6, oh heck make that a V8 this would change this sweet thing from a city car to a terrific ride!  Maybe Chrysler will consider a performance PT Cruiser.
