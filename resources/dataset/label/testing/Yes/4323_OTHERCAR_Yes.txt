            Having owned the DSC-P1, I traded in my P1 for a DSC-P7.  Although the megapixel count was the same, it was a big step up for several reasons.

Thinness
The camera is thinner than the P1 and definitely fits into a pants or shirt pocket very easily.  On my 80's style tight jeans, I often forget that the camera is even in my back pocket.

LCD screen
The LCD is viewable in sunlight conditions.  However, the screen does protrude significantly from the rest of the back of the camera, tarnishing the overall slimness of the camera.  It's a bit irritating given the overall svelteness and sleekness of the camera.  Even with that the camera is very pocketable.

Taking Pictures
The shutter lag is now on par with most digicams, about 0.5 seconds.  Picture quality is good.

Movie Editing
The really neat feature is that you can cut/slice movies to remove unwanted segments.  This happens in edit mode, and is really handy for freeing up memory space when you're away from a PC.

Quick Movie Turnaround
Movies are streamed directly to memory.  Once you finish taking a movie, you can immediately shoot your next movie.  This is a great feature compared with other cameras that require a waiting period to write to memory before shooting the next movie.

Movie Length
Movies are limited in duration only by the size of the memory stick, which for a 128MB Stick is about 6 minutes in High Quality 320x240, 23 minutes in 320x240, and 90 minutes in 160x120.

Still Image Shooting
Not much to say here, except that it shoots like most 3.2MP point-n-shoots.  It doesn't have any direct manual controls over shutter speed or aperture, and it lacks shutter, aperture priority modes.  So it isn't a primary camera for pros, but it does make a great point-n-shoot camera, backup camera, or take-anywhere-anytime camera.
