            As a two time Pontiac Grand Am Se owner, I have a LOT to say about these cars. The first Grand Am that I purchased was a 1994 program car. It had less than 20,000 miles on it and was in very good condition. My husband and I shared the car, so the mileage racked up in a hurry. He drove it over 50 miles a day back and forth to work. After several years of constant use, the car was still holding up quite well. (a few minor repairs was all the upkeep it required)  

The car handled very nicely and offered a smooth ride every trip.  (It did have a slight pull to the right at times, even after the tires were rotated and aligned.) My infant daughter had plenty of room for her seat and all the things needed when traveling with young children.  My husband and I traveled quite comfortably with heat and air that always worked quickly and efficiently.  Another plus was the amount of space in the trunk; there was plenty of room for luggage, the baby swing and playpen and much more.

With all the unpaid travel that my husband had to do daily, the gas mileage was a BIG issue with us.  We found that this car got an average of 30-32 miles to the gallon.   This, on top of the reasonable price of the Grand Am itself, made it a very economical vehicle.  

In 1998, after over 130,000 miles, we decided to trade the car in. After looking at many different makes and models of cars, I found one I fell in love with. The only difference between it and my old one was about 4 years, 80,000 miles and a coat of paint. (the old one was red...this one is green) I guess I'd have to say that I'm a loyal Grand Am owner. I would highly recommend the Grand Am to anyone from a high school student to a family of four (such as my own).
