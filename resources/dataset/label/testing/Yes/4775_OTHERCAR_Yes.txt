            I bought my S-10 in 1996 for $2,000. It was used with 136K miles, but it looked and drove like new, and besides, it was my first vehicle. For $2000 it was a great deal for a 16year-old guy who just needed to get around. 
My truck has the 2.8L V-6 ,5spd, short bed, Tahoe package. I looked at other S-10's with the standard appointments, but the Tahoe trim package is very nice; chrome trim,AM-FM casette, AC, full instrumentation, and a nice cloth interior. I only wish I had the extended cab version. I am 6' tall, and the cab is a little tight, but not uncomfortably so. Overall, I like the interior, but the window sills dry-rotted and scratched my window tint. This is my only compliant.
It drives, well, like a truck! The previous owner had the tow package installed so the ride is a little stiff, but responsive. I rides much nicer with about 200lbs in the back. The rear end is very light; almost dangerously so when driving in slick conditions. I use a wider-than-stock tire which remedies the problem. The small V-6 isn't a rocket, but it's still fun to drive. It has more torque than the 4cyl which makes it easier to drive and saves on gas (18-25mpg). This truck is fun to drive!
I would reccomend this truck to any single person looking for the most dependable vehicle on the road. I was only stranded once in 63,000 miles because of a dead battery! It now has almost 200K on it and it still runs great. Don't buy if your are big or tall, and you have more than one person in your family. <br><br>
