            I didn't go to the dealer intending to buy a sporty convertible.  In fact, I never even pictured myself IN such a car ... but it was love at first site and I haven't regretted the decision at all.

First of all, it's volkswagen, and I am one of those faithful followers that has a tremendous amount of loyalty to the company and their creations.  With VW you can't just look at the sticker price, you need to compare all of the standard features that most comparable cars don't come with.  In shopping around, I found that once I added all these features that I wanted, the others ended up MORE expensive.  Things like 10yr/100,000mile warranty, roadside assistance, power locks and keyless entry/alarm system, stereo that is CD changer ready, etc.  When you compare the details, VW really is a great value.  And who can beat the volkswagen &quot;family&quot; feeling... :)

As for the cabrio, I have the lower of the two models.  This means I have cloth seats and have to manually put my top down.  The top is a very simple process that takes about a minute, maybe two if you're putting the bott on.  As for the interior, leather would have made me nervous because convertibles in general just aren't as good about leaving the rain outside (mental note: no little rain gutters over the windows and door frames).  Plus, leather would have gotten too hot during the summer when the sun is shining down.

The stereo is awesome, and having a CD player in the truck is very convenient .. out of the way, and yet always excessible.

I average about 25-27 mpg, which is about what the sticker said.  

Overall, I *love* my new cabrio.  It is so fun and sporty, and yet even though it is a convertible, I feel very safe.  There is a rollbar, alarm w/ panic button, the headlights have an *awesome* range, making night driving much easier.  The top is very well insulated, helping with sound, moisture, and temperature control.

Also, it has tremendous space for a convertible.  If you're used to the typical VW trunk, it is a little bit smaller, but still larger than a lot of standard cars I've seen.  PLUS the rear seat folds down to make way for even MORE room. :)

My only complaint .... IT'S WINTER TIME AND I CAN'T PUT MY TOP DOWN!!!! :)  I know it sounds cheezy, but this car has changed my perspective on life.  I used to LOVE the cold winter months full of rain, and now I am counting down the days until spring and summer when I can have fun in the sun. :)  Go get one!!! :)<br><br>
