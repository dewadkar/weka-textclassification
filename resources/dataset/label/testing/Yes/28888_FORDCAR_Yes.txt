            I got the Ford Explorer the day before Valentines Day. It was such a great gift from my parents.I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it,plus it was the last Ford Explorer sport that thay had at Sarasota Ford so I jumped at the opportunity to snatch it before anybody else did. I consider myself very lucky to be owning such a vechicle.The car its self just looks amazing. Its quite impressive. Its got such a sporty look and yet classy. The color of the Explorer is white and I think the color is great. Just about any color would look good on an Explorer it all depends on what your favorite color is or what your looking for. I love that it is the perfect size. Its not to big or to small. Its got plenty of room to go on those long road trips for those of you who like to travel.Its very comfortable and has amazing trunk space so you could carry just about anything that you want to bring along. you drive in comfort so you never want to get out of the car. The engine is very quiet along with the A/C system so your not anoid by excruciating sounds. If you love to listen to music than you'll love this truck because the sound that comes that comes out of the system is just amazing. Its so clear and it has great base. I leave the radio on all the time just to listen to my great sound system. This vehicle is considered a truck but it definitly doesn't drive like one. Where ever your going its all smooth driving it takes bumbs like they weren't there. If your looking for something semi big I recommend you purchase one right away. Its worth the money and you'll enjoy every minute of it. If you're the type of person that worries about gas I wouldn't get it because the Explorer eats up alot of gas. I know I am one of many of the satisfied customers and I encourage youto make the move yourself.<br><br>
