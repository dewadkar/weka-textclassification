            My father gave me his 95 M3 when he just bought his new 2000 BMW 328 Coupe.  The M3 is a fast reliable sports car.  Handles good at any speed, and is also great for just around town driving.  It's the perfect everyday sports car.  The price tag is quite large on newer M3's, but they are worth every penny, and the resale value is high.  They don't lose any value.  I have no dislikes for the M3 other then I wish I had one sooner.  This car accelerates quickly, stop in a heart beat, it is comfortable, and has never given me any problems.  I love this car to death and the only thing I would imagine doing is maybe adding a chip, and a turbo charger to get some more speed.  Getting into an M3 your surrounded by the luxurious smell of fine leather, and feel right at home in the drivers seat.  It's comfortable, and can be adjusted in a million different directions.  The clutch is a little stiffer then most cars people have probaly driven, but is quite easy to get use to (I have only stalled it out once).  The car accelerates at any speed. Whether your doing 30mph and jump to 60mph or your doing 90mph and jump to 120mph. The car is rev happy.  I love having it buried around 6000-7000rpm, it sounds great.  It's also great for saving gas.  Start out in 1st gear, then just put it into 3rd or 4th.  Everyone should look into buying an M3.  Yes, it isn't the cheapest car but you can pick up 95 M3's for under $20,000 sometimes.  Not a lot, but I have seen a couple recently.  The car is great, and the only way I am getting rid of it is when I get a new M3, and I'll probaly still keep it. <br><br>
