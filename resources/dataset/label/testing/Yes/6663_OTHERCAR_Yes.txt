            The 2 door model is very stylish and a total blast to drive.  I only wish the engine had a little more oomph to it.  Although, I do get great gas mileage.  I must say that this is my 2nd Tracker.  I lost my 1995 version to a 35 mph head on collision.  No air bags in the '95.  Between the seat belt and the impact absorption of the body, I made it out with no injuries as far as I can tell (it's been a week).  As expected, was pretty sore.  This car is more fun than my first Tracker and looks sooooooo much better.  Other "new" features include automatic headlights, digital odometer and trip meter, map lights, lug nut lock and nice cover on spare tire, rear door "ooze control", and a nicer stock radio.  I rated the seats as a 4 because they are totally manual.  Noise level is a 4 only because it's a convertible.  Actually, it's very quiet for a rag top.  For the money - this is a deal!
