            I drove a Land Rover Discovery all spring in Colorado.  A friend of mine graciously let me borrow hers while she spent the winter in Florida.  I do not usually drive such fancy cars.  

The Discovery is by no means basic transportation.  People who buy it are looking for traction, visibility, perceived safety (I'm not convinced since SUVs tend to roll more easily), status, off-road capabilities or a combination of the above.  But few people would pick this car to commute and drive around town. Why?  Read on. 

The thing weighs two tons.  It gets terrible gas mileage (medium grade unleaded only please) and it does not handle well.  I got a KIA sedan as a loaner car once and immediately noticed how much better it took speed bumps.  Moreover, the Discovery is so large that the V8 struggles to pull it uphill.  

Disappointments don't end there.  I found the finish of the car to be sub-par.  Several items on the console (the window controls and the automatic shift) came undone at different points in the car's lifetime.  They were fixed by the very courteous staff at the dealership, but one expects better from a Land Rover.  

I did enjoy the notoriety that came with driving the Discovery.  It is undoubtedly a 'cool' looking car and one that people easily recognize.  I never took it off-road (remember, it wasn't mine) but I am told that it handles nasty situations with aplomb.  The visibility is comforting, if one doesn't mind blocking the people behind them.  There is a lot of room, but the strange vertical orientation means that less fits in the back than one would think.  And I appreciated the heated seats on some cold mornings. 

But I would never buy one of these, and I can't see recommending it to too many people except those who needed a foul-weather car and didn't mind spending a fortune for gas.  Reviews from friends of mine who have the same car are mixed: some love it but most are underwhelmed.  I haven't driven many other SUVs so I can't rate it relative to its direct competitors. But for those considering the Discovery, I would have to recommend looking further.
