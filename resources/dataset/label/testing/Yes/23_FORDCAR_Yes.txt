            My wife and I were looking for three primary features in our new car:
1)  Affordability
2)  Horsepower
3)  Space
We found all three in the 1999 Ford Taurus SE.

1)  For the same dollars we would have had to drop down to a smaller Japanese sedan, or crack the wallet wide open to cover a European sport sedan.  Even a comparable Bonneville or Regal would have set us back more than the Taurus.
2)  The SE comes w/ a 24 valve V-6 that can really get up and go.  We drive over hills and onto freeway onramps daily, and never have to worry about lagging on a climb, or getting smacked by a semi while merging.
3)  Space was a real concern.  We were coming out of an SUV that was just killing us w/ frequent fill-ups and general high maintenance costs, but we really loved having all the trunk and seating room.  The Taurus has all the room we were looking for:  comfortable seating for 5 (lots of head and leg room), and a huge, deep trunk.

The only drawback I've found is that it tends to float through turns, rather than really eating them up.  Also, it's only been getting ~20 mpg where I was hoping for closer to 24.

Our goal was to find a primary use car that could handle an 80 mile-a-day commute reliably, could haul family and friends in comfort, wouldn't guzzle gas, and would be fun to drive.  So far, the 1999 Taurus SE works for us.
