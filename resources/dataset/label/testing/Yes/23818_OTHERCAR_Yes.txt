            I have been a Toyota driver for many years, and currently own a beautiful Celica.  When my wife said that it was time to shop for a second car, we checked out everything in the subcompact class and decided on the 2000 Toyota Echo.  This was the best decision that I could have made - the Celica now occupies my garage most of the time and I just drive the Echo.

The Toyota Echo is not quite a masterpiece, but darn close to it for the price (mine was under $13,000 with almost all of the options). The engine has the unusual feature of variable timing that comes right from Lexus.  This gives a remarkable amount of pep to the 1.5 liter engine.  Even with my automatic transmission, I can get acceleration that compares favorably to my (more expensive) Celica.  And over 30 miles per gallon in the city is a very big plus in my book.

Probably the factor that impressed me most about this car when I first drove it, is the roominess of the interior.  I am a big guy (over 6'2&quot;) but I have tons of head room and leg room in this car.  The dash and instrumentation are aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. At first, I wondered how I would get used to the off-center speedometer, but I found it to be wonderful after one or two days of city driving.

Probably, the only downside that I have experienced with my new Echo is the amount of times people stop me to ask about my &quot;cool little car&quot;.  There are very few Echos in my area, so the car is seen as quite a novelty.  Each person that asks, invariably is impressed and walks away with several backward glances. Toyota has designed a true winner in the 2000 Echo!
