            When I turned 16 I found myself searching for a reliable little car. After looking at a couple different makes, I found myself looking at a 1990 BMW 325i. The main reason why I ended up purchasing the car is that, for it's age it was in solid condition. I also know from the BMW's my family has owned that they are wonderfully reliable cars if taken care of properly.  So, at the age of 16 I became the proud owner of what would soon be known as Bessie the Tin Can. 

She got then name mainly for the sound system. It's the only part of the car that I'm not exactly happy with. It sounds like it's coming through a tin can. No matter what amount of fiddling with it won't bring you the kind of sound you want. So, if you're one of those people that appreciate a good sound system...get ready to gut the car and purchase a new one. 

Bessie is now 12 years old, and has 157k. She suffered through my learning to drive (a young female behind the wheel, go ahead and guess). This involved hitting cart returns (my apologies to kroger), a basketball goal, a brick retaining wall, my brothers truck, also going air borne after the pavement mysteriously ended on my way home from work one night one night, and other mishaps. Through all that she has held up wonderfully, like a tank actually. So, I can definitely give the little car great marks on durability. Not to mention the fact that it is a great car for new drivers. There isn't much you can do to hurt it. But, when hurt the maintenance bills can hurt. Some of the parts have gone out of manufacturing and will require some hunting or hefty prices to attain. 

On another note: she gets about 17mpg in the city, 23mpg on the highway. So, that's pretty decent. So, is the power. At 168hp, it's a fun car to drive. BMW's are also known for exact steering and crisp braking, and this one is no exception. 

The only thing that I feel I should warn potential buyers of is the fact that the entire electric system is wired through one single chip. These have a history of dying on the earlier e30 models. For more information on the car you're thinking of purchasing, you should visit http://www.bmwe30.net/ . This site has great info on the e30. If it happens to die, it's something that can be fixed. But don't be surprised if you can't get the car to the doctor's office. 

Besides high maintenance fees (it's easy to do the work on your own anyway) and the small problem with the chip, it's a great car. Fun to drive, durable and reliable.
