            I currently have a 93 Ford Ranger that I bought new.  It now has over 118,000 miles on it and the only thing I have done to it was to replace a water pump at 95,000 miles.  For the first three years that I had the pickup, I was on the road driving about 30,000 mile a year.  The economy of the pickup was great.

The pickup is equipped with the 3.0 V6 engine with a standard transmission.  I have been very careful about the regular maintenance of the vehicle.  The oil changed every three thousand miles.  It still does not use any oil between changes.  

I have pulled a 19.6 foot boat with it.   Granted I could have used more power but the Ranger did the job for me.  I got another vehicle that we now pull the boat with.  

This is my third Ford Ranger.  I bought a 1987 Ranger new and drove it until it had 150,000 miles on it.  That pickup did not have any problems.  At that time I was driving about 40,000 miles a year and the economy of owning this pickup is what led me to buy the next two.  

I bought a 1987 Ranger used.  It has about 40,000 miles on it when I bought and sold it with 150,000 miles on it.  The period of time that I had it I was on the road again racking up in excess of 50,000 miles a year.

Needless to say, I have gotten my money's worth out of these trucks.  The only thing that will keep me from buying another Ranger is the desire for more comfort.  But along as I have to travel in my work, I will keep the economy and low maintenance of the Ranger.
