            My roommate owns a 97 Altima, bought it when it was new.  I have driven it numerous times, and even though I am not a huge fan of Nissan, this car is a good choice for people who are or really don't care.

It is very good on gas mileage, the one we have gets around 28 miles to the gallon, more than that on open highway.

The ride in this car is very smooth, the suspension is built very well for the car.  It is a quiet ride with little or no bumps.  No, speedbumps don't count.  The steering is quite nice, the power steering is somewhat loose, but it has no play.  The car responds as soon as you move the wheel.

The car is quite a powerful car.  The engine can easily push the car along, and it has a very quick acceleration rate.  If you're the type who thinks peeling out is cool, then this car will do it.<br><br>
