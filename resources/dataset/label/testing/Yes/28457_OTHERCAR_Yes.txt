            Bought my Avalon XLS one year ago today and have been extremely pleased with it.  Was hesitant when first considering the Avalon, thinking it was an "old person's" car and too big.  But when I compared the Camry and the Avalon side by side, the actual exterior size of the cars was almost identical.  The difference is on the interior.  The Avalon has a luxurious and roomy interior that is very comfortable.  I love the "memory" function for the seat that allows you to set the mirrors and seat levels for 2 different drivers and with the touch of a button adjusts same for each driver.  The car handles great and has better pickup than our old Camry.  Definitely not just an older person's type of car.  We have had no problems and with standard maintenance, the car still seems like a brand new car.  We had our last car, the Camry, for 15 years and we bought this time knowing that we like to hold on to a car until it is practically worn out.  The only complaint is the difficulty in seeing the end of the trunk when trying to back up.  It takes some getting used to and a bit of trial and error.  Other than that small quibble, we have been delighted with our choice.
