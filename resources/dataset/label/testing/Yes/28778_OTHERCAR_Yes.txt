            If you have $400 to $500 to spend on a digital camera, this is the one to get.  The photo quality is sharp and there are many different settings you can choose from so if you want to conserve memory and take only snapshots you can, or if you want to get a big old 128MB memory stick so you can take something like 80 or 90 pictures at the highest resolution, you can do that as well.  The colors are vibrant and with glossy photo paper, you can't tell the difference between an actual photo and a printout.  

The big advantage this camera has in my opinion is the Carl Zeiss lens.  This is the same lens used in some extremely high end (ie several thousand dollar) SLR cameras.  This is a glass lens, whereas most cameras you buy now days are plastic, and it gives you pictures that you would not expect to get from a point and shoot.  

The zoom on this thing is wonderful, giving this camera a range as good as or better than most $200 - $300 point and shoot cameras.  

The video can be bad, in its lowest setting it is very small and very grainy, but if you care to use the higher setting, you can certainly get a video that looks good on your monitor if not your TV.

The sound feature is one I've been meaning to try, but what a cool idea.

Having worked with other digitals which require serial download, I can say the USB download is one of the best things ever to happen.  You hook this puppy up via USB and it's just like a removeable drive.  You can then drag and drop pictures/videos to your PC, no problem, in no time flat.

The battery is also great, especially if you already have a Sony video camera, cuz then your batteries are interchangeable and you only need one adapter (plus really, you may go months or years without having to recharge this battery).  Compared to my last camera for which I had to buy rechargeable alkalines to keep from going broke, and at that I had to recharge them every couple weeks, this battery lasts thousands of shots, and the camera has a sleep mode so it will shut itself down if you forget.  

There are a lot of neat features, like indicators that tell you if you left the cap on, date & time stamp, picture remaining indicator, plus manual and automatic exposure setting, ability to add a flash or emulate a particular speed of film, sound and video recorder, the list goes on and on.  This camera is great for me, a person who just wants something simple on one end, to my wife who is the real pro in the house and can use the advanced features to really express herself creatively in ways that are beyond my imagination.  I can't see our family outgrowing this camera...it's versatile, lightweight and chock full of features.
