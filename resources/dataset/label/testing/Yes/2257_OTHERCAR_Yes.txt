            Lexus LS 400, 96 model was an ultimate car its time. There are no negative points in this car, which I can think of. It�s really amazing; it has amazing performance, amazing compatibility, amazing fuel economy, and amazing list of amazements.


<b>SPECS:</b>
              It�s a v8 engine with 260 hp, dohc 32 valve, and 4.0L and has aluminum blocks and heads. In my opinion the car pretty powerful and strong from inside and outside, you cannot get such a good sedan in between 25 to 30000$ except for the LS 400, 96 model.


<b>THE PERFORMANCE:</b>
              The Ls400, 96 models do very well to beat sedans like bmw 740i and Mercedes E420, both of 96-model, performance wise. The LS 400, 96 models does 0-
60 mph in 7.8 sec and � mile in15.8 sec @ 92 mph and its top speed touches 156 mph, which I would say is astonishing. LS 400 out runs the bmw 740i in all categories listed above but the E420 wins in the 0-60 mph and � mile contest.

The Ls 400 is magnificent performance wise; there is no doubt about that. 
The engine works smoothly with less noise. It makes the sedan run like hell.


<b>COMFORT, STYLE, LUXURY FEATURES....</b>
          Ls 400, 96 is very spacey .its like u are in you are in your bedroom. Similarly LS400 is comfortable, you cannot feel any bumps and jumps�
Gives you a smooth drive.
The small details inside LS400, 96 work beautifully. There is a center visor over the mirror, mounted so that it swivels in any direction you choose. The seats adjust quickly and there are many tiny details in the sedan that you will love. Basically where the car lack behind is in its styling, which you can say is bit common, other wise the car is marvelous, astonishing, magnificent, incredible in any other feature you can talk about.
