            When I was shopping for a entry-level luxury vehicle, i had narrowed my choices to an Acura TL or an I30..  I had some concerns about build quality of the Acura as it's assembled in the US (I can't stand rattles and such) and I heard Infiniti really has good dealer service as opposed to snooty Acura dealers, plus the I30 looked much more classy, so I decided to go with the I30 with Navigation.

The Car

Engine and Transmission

The engine is smooth and reasonably powerful for this type of car.  0-60 in about 8 seconds, no sports car, but no slouch either.  However, the 4 speed automatic transmission does not shift smoothly at all.  The shifts are always lurchy and noticable, I had another I30 rental while my car was in getting its transmission replaced (more on that later) and it was the same, so it's not just my car.  Plus, when parked on an incline, such as a driveway, it is very difficult to shift out of park and makes a clunking sound when it does.

Interior

The leather is very nice quality (10X better than the leather in the acura) and the fake wood looks less fake than the acura as well.  :)  overall, the interior has a classy look with some nice little touches, such as the bubble type lenses over the PRND indicators next to the gear shifter.  The stereo is pretty good, with ample bass but lacking a bit in clarity and definition, but as far as OEM car stereos go, this is an excellent unit.

Exterior

The exterior is somewhat boring, but is very classy, when I drive past store windows or gas tankers, I always try to see how my car looks, personally, I much prefer the vertical grill to the new horizontal grills on the I35

Navigation

I paid about $2000 more for the navigation after debating like heck whether it would be worth the money.  I heard from people that had it and all of them said it was worth it.  I got it and am glad that I got it.  After I bouth the car, I was looking for a new house and the navigation was very, very handy in going to see all the different houses as i get lost very, very easily.  and even when not going to new places, it's cool to have it turned on and have it track you.  and at times, even on roads I've travelled countless times, the navi suggested a different route and it turned out be a more direct route.. i also like it when people in other cars gawk at it as they pass by.  :)
The screen itself is usually hidden, but pops out of the middle of the dashboard when turned on.  it is fairly easy to use, but using the 'joystick' to move around instead of having a touchscreen is slightly more difficult, i would have preferred a touchscreen for inputting street names/numbers and such.  Overall, this is a very useful tool, but it's definitely not for everyone.  I highly recommend it and all my future cars will have navigation.

Dealer Service

It should be noted that my car has had its entire transmission replaced (under warranty, but still..) with less than 5000 miles.  My car started leaking oil, I took it to a local dealer, Joe McPherson Infiniti, they said it was a simple gasket, replaced it, it continued to leak, took it to a different dealer, Cerritos Infiniti and they said the transmission would have to be replaced.  So what was Joe McPherson Inf. trying to pull?  did they not want to hassle with a warranty repair so they just shut me up and sent me on my way?  i wouldn't be surprised if they did.  Do avoid Joe McPherson Infiniti if you can in Tustin, CA.

Another thing is this good customer service Infiniti provides has been almost non-existant.  When I first bought my car, the navigation didn't work, so I brought it to a local dealer (i bought the car from a dealer far away), and they refused to even look at it, they said to take it back to where I bought it from...  utterly ridiculous, not only that, they yelled at me, gave me nasty stares as I was leaving, etc etc...  plus, they kept arguing that I was wrong that all I needed was a setup disc to be used on my system, they kept telling me I was wrong, and when I later proved them wrong, nobody apologized, that was my first visit to an Infiniti dealer for service, since then it hasn't been much better, at the previously mentioned Joe McPherson dealership, they refused to give me a rental saying all the rentals were out, which i know is a lie, cuz i saw some outside.  I've had oil changes where the porter didn't cover the seats or even laid those paper mats on the floor, even the honda dealer does that..  and when my car was returned after having the tranny replaced, there was a nice paint chip in the front bumper which I didn't even bother with, since all they say is "oh, it was already there."

overall, the car is very nice, having the tranny replace with 5000 miles may be just this particular car, but it has permanently damaged my trust in nissan/infiniti products.. plus their poor service (I have been much better treated at Honda dealerships, which are known for bad service!) has really made this ownership experience a mixed one..

Having said all that, I still would recommend this car, just hope you have better luck with the service departments.
