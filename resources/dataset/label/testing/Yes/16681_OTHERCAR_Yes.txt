            If you're going to get a wagon, you might as well get a NICE wagon.  Go ahead and trick it up.

I highly recommend the Duratec DOHC V-6.  Much spunkier than the standard engine.

I love the leather interior.  The console and console shifter add an element of sportiness, even though they take away an occasional seating position.

I wish I'd gotten the top of the line stereo with CD changer.  My only big mistake with this car.

A comfortable, economical, decent handling ride that'll seat 7 (assuming a couple of small ones in the back).  As an adult, I've even ridden in the waaay back seat for not long distances.

The only thing I would have liked would be heated seats.  Why doesn't Ford offer them?

There are lots of reviews here on earlier Sables, Ford has improved the line as the years have gone along, I would not hesitate to buy a 2000.

I recently borrowed my sisters 2000 Subaru outback Wagon...  It's an extremely nice machine.  Somewhat idiosyncratic, but nice.  Killer sound system and an easy ride with good handling.  I'd definitely consider one of them...

But it's four thousand dollars more expensive than our Sable.  That's a chunk o' change.

As an economical family car, easy to purchase and maintain, it's hard to beat.  And, unlike an SUV, it'll handle.
