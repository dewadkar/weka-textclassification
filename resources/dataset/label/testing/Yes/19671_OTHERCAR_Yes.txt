            I own a Saturn SL2 and I love it!  It is my second Saturn since I started purchasing cars.  I owned other compact cars before these and I just didnt like them.  The Saturn runs smooth, drives great and is an overall great car for the money.  I never have problems getting things fixed or looked at by the service department and the cost is minimal or nothing at times.  The dealership where I purchased my car was great.     The people were friendly, courteous, and all around nice.  I wasnt haggled into a car that had things I didnt need or want. Only draw back from the car is the roominess.  It is a little snug for a large/tall person.  But all in all if I need to buy another car in the future it will be another Saturn.  Maybe this time an SC model.<br><br>
