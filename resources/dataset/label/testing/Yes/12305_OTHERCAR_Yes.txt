            Over the last four years, I've owned a '92 300ZX Twin Turbo, '92 BMW 325i, and a '98 Nissan Maxima. After a few years of driving the BMW around, I decided it was time for something new (with less maintenance requirements and more &quot;fun&quot;). After test driving a new Eclipse GT with the premium package, all options, 5 speed, I decided this would be my new car. I have *not* been disappointed. This car handles well, is quite quick, has a fantastic sporty suspension that makes you really feel you are driving, not the other way around. And that's just the performance.
The interior is 100% improved over previous models. It is ergonomic, spacey (for a car this size), and laid out very well. The dash board is intuitive with all controls in the right place. My only complaint with the interior is the LCD digital clock - you'd of thought they could put something a tad more modern and attractive then the dull grey LCD readout that's there.
I am very partial to the exterior look, as well. I have a spoiler and sun visor on the top. From some angles, this car looks very much like the 3000 GT, which is a compliment, in my opinion. But it retains it's own character. I see people looking at the car and paying attention more often then I thought. Undoubtedly, though, as the next year or two goes by, I will be seeing lots of the same model whizzing past me, and some of this initial appeal will have worn off. 
Overall, I'm very happy with this car, and would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
