            Ok, my families 1984 Mercury Topaz. Where to start? It was purchased brand spankin' new by my grandfather in the fall of 1983. At that time, it was Ford's newest innovation along with its clone, the Ford Tempo. It was the future of the automobile world back in '84, with its rounded edges, and I vaguely remember it being featured in a futuristic Tom Selleck movie in 1984, but I can't remember the title.
     A visual. It's a maroon, four door, gray interior, LS model. It has automatic transmission, am/fm premium stereo, and at present a whopping 475,000 km's on the odometer (ya, that's kilometers, I'm Canadian, eh).  The good and bad of it. We purchased the car from my grandparents in 1988, and have driven it hard ever since, and it's still going. Unfortunately, since we hit about 450,000km's, the going has become quite tough. The tranny, rear CV joint, rad, carb, alt, and even the speedometer, have had to be replaced. All at nearly the same time too, so for the span of about two months, the car was a complete wreck, yet still being used to commute. The total truth is that the car will never let you down, no matter if its smoking, backfiring, or overheating down the road. However, the drawback is that after 400,000km's, it will smoke, backfire, and overheat!!  And the dense smokescreen of exhaust that trails behind the car is a bit embarrassing. All this, yet I still love the car. Why?
     This car has lasted my family for 18 years, and is still going. And honestly, how many cars have nearly half a million kilometers on them, and are still on the road. Not many, that's for sure. If there are Topaz's out there with fewer than 300,000km's on them, I highly recommend them. Just keep them properly maintained, and they'll keep going. Pay no attention to those who bad mouth these inexpensive vehicles, they probably just abuse their vehicles. My family is a very typical suburban family, and our Topaz has served us very well.
     The Topaz is a fine car for traveling, it comfortably seats four, has great air-conditioning, cruise control for long trips, and a fairly smooth ride. Difficulty arises in the winter, however, because the windows fog up easily, the defrost system for the front windows is not strong enough.
The Topaz 4cyl, also gets very good gas mileage, but if its not fuel injected, there are frequent carb. problems. The trunk is spacious, if not huge, and there is plenty of elbow and storage room inside the car. There is also a really cool electronic diagram of the car on the lower dash, parts of which light up to signal problem areas, ie: low fuel, or burnt out break light.  The seats begin to lose support after around 400,000kms of driving, but for most Topaz's, that probably hasn't been reached yet. 
     While we have had numerous problem's with our Topaz recently, it is directly because of our extremely high mileage. This is a very good all around vehicle, ideal for families.
