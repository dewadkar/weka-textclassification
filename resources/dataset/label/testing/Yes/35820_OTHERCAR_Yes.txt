<TEXT>
            I was the owner of a 1994 Pontiac Firebird, and pregnant with our second child. Since the Firebird isn't known for it's roomy aspects, my husband and I decided we needed more of a family car.
I, being one who likes the sportier looking vehicles, agreed to getting a Saturn. We purchased a 1996 Saturn SLII(4 door), loaded with all the extras, except automatic transmission, which is fine by me(see my Manual vs Automatic opinion).
The things I like most about my Saturn are:
All controls are well within reach of the driver
Gas mileage is unbeatable
Comfortable, and roomy interior

While the Saturn isn't a luxury made car, they are comfortable. And Saturns are affordable to most anyone.
