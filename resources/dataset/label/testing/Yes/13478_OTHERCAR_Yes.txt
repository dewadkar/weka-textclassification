            We were looking for an inexpensive, reliable convertible and this car delivered!

After becoming disenchanted with our Jeep which was always having problems we bought a new convertible Geo in 1992.  After nearly nine years and 80,000 miles we have had only one mechanical problem that cost a few hundred dollars to repair.  Granted we don't drive it real hard but how can you hot-rod a three cylinder engine?  The manual five-speed does have adequate pick-up for merging on the freeway and general city driving.  It even does ok on an occasional hill provided you get a running start.  (I've ridden in similar Geos with an automatic transmission and the ride isn't nearly as pleasant.)  There is surprisingly good leg room though this car obviously wasn't made for long trips.  I've made a couple of ten hour drives and you arrive mighty stiff.

The down-side is what Consumer Reports refers to as body-integrity.  Little plastic pieces falling off periodically and sometimes you don't even know where they came from.  Also, the weather stripping around the doors has a tendency to come loose allowing rain to drip in.  Mainly these things are just a nuisance.  We jokingly refer to it as our lego car.  After a few minutes of fiddling we are usually able to repair the problem.

The convertible top is easy to put up and down though at times takes quite a bit of leverage to get latched.  There is an odd pass-through space from behind the seats to the trunk.  I don't know what purpose this was designed for but we use it to hold two large stereo speakers that are mounted in boxes and bolted to the floor.  They sound great even with the top down and the wind rushing by and they drown out the rattles that are typical in small cars.

When replacing the tires you may wish to go with the alternative tire choice which is a bit narrower than the originals.  The wide tires look nicer and probably hug the road a little better but they are $50 a piece. We got the narrower tires for $25 dollars a piece and I haven't really noticed the difference.

Just recently we were having a problem with it not starting once in a while.  After talking to a friend that had the same problem with an old Geo we found out that for some reason it doesn't like really cold, foggy mornings.  I don't know why this is and we've never had that problem until now but we opted to start keeping it in the garage and it hasn't happened since.

As is rumored the gas mileage is unbelievable.  The last I checked it is still getting over 40 mpg in the city and on the freeway it's around 50.<br><br>
