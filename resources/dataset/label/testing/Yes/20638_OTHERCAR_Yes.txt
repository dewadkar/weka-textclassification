            My parents have recently purchased a brand-new Audi A6 Avant Quattro. It is by all means the most luxurious and powerful car my parents have ever owned, and for $41,400 (with all applicable taxes), the most expensive as well.

According to Audi -- a VW subsidiary -- the A4 and A6 Avant models re-define the station wagon; thus the name Avant, as an <i>advance</i> over everything else. Although I have not driven the new BMW 3-series, the 5-series, or the Mercedes E-320 station wagons, I think the A6 is a fine choice between the cramped BMW 3-series and the $50-grand Benz. If you are very budget conscious, consider the Passat. It is an awesome, full-featured vehicle with a price tag at the high $20's. VW has even introduced all wheel drive for 2001 [4-motion].

Note that this review is a first looks only, since I have yet to fully experience all the A6 is capable of. After 1,200 miles, there's only so much one can write about.

<i><b>Introduction</b></i>

The A6 is a beautiful car, but the exterior is rather boring in contrast to the luxurious interior. While the interior features real leather (opt.), wood accents, a shower of red lights, and electronic gadgets left and right, the exterior is bland with what looks like ten panels and some large tinted windows. I think the only catchy part is the front grille with the <i>coool</i> Audi logo, and the round light bulbs nearby. The fog lights in the back are cute, too; but only the left one actually turns on. German engineers...

<b>Comfort</b>

The A6 is extremely comfortable. So nice, I often find myself walking by the car in the garage, stop, look inside, and moving in. Ahhh, the pleasant environment! It's quite relaxing.

Hey, want to go for a drive? Let's try this out*: <i><b>free your mind</b></i>, no pressure to read twenty reviews today ;O), just clear it out, come on, I don't think you are ready to buy one today... there it is, metallic, sand-colored, German engineering at its best. Now open the door to a nearly full 90 degrees, hmmm, the new smell, the soft leather, the aluminum panels, the tight spaces between each display, oooohh, 5-gear automatic transmission with the option to go manual! <b>COOL!</b>

Now move inside. There's no problem going through the tall/wide door, the seat is wide, but firm. Adjust the seat 6 ways electronically, move the lumbar support up/down/front or back. Grab the steering wheel, too far? Move it up/down/forward and back. Now the engineï¿½

No, wait! <b>Buckle up first!</b> That's critical... ;O)

<b>Performance</b>

The A6 packs a 2.8-liter V6 engine with 200 hp and an incredible all-wheel drive system. Although a bit slow at the line, I think everyone will agree that this station wagon has a lot of torque (207 lb/ft @ 3,200 rpm). Keep in mind this is not a sports car, but a spacious luxury family vehicle for short and long trips. Many epinionators have expressed disappointment with the A6 2.8L sedan. Although they are right to complain on the car, I think it's unfounded to expect a station wagon to go 0-60 in 5 secs. It's not like you'd race with a car like this, anyway. You'd look ridiculous! :O)

Further on, Audi has placed all the gauges in easy to view places. Though I found the radio's bass/treble/mid/balance and fade buttons difficult to manage while driving, I liked the layout of everything else. Herein, the &quot;difficulty&quot; lies in the fact that you have to press on each knob first, so it pops out, and then move it around according to your taste. Now try doing this on a smooth dashboard, it's a little tricky finding the right one at <b>80 mph</b>.

<b>SOUND</b>

I don't usually write a separate category on sound, but 140 watts are difficult to manage. This car has a standard CD player, FM/AM, and cassette radio. There are 8 (eight) speakers around the car, and a subwoofer in the back. Plus, you have the option to upgrade to 200 watts from Bose. I think the standard Symphonic system is superb as it is.

A small complaint: you have to turn the radio 'on' before pushing a CD in, or pressing the eject button. This is really annoying!

<b>Design</b>

This car has almost everything! In front: dual climate controls, all digital, aluminum panels side-by-side with wood and strong, yet soft to the touch, rubber-like panels, red beams travel through the air at night, an electric moon roof (turn the knob, and it's <b>moving</b>), huge windows, virtually no blind spots, and a right rear view mirror that faces down when you are driving back.

Only two minor complaints: the grill on the right speaker came with a minor flaw (scratched), and...

&quot;Once, while driving on I-5 from Los Angeles to San Diego, I tried to change lanes to the one on my right, pulling the steering wheel &quot;lightly&quot; to the right. To my surprise, I ended up on the second lane to my right! Fortunately, there were no vehicles there.&quot;

I found the steering wheel in this car way too soft. It's nice to turn just a bit and make a full U-turn at the signal, but it too should react differently at faster speeds! Note that I was going only 60 mph while doing the maneuver above. Any little touch, and you are not moving to the next lane, but <b>turning</b> into it. That was scary.

In the rear, passengers have a moving center armrest with an opening for skis (and the bag is already there), a full medical kit (lots of stuff in there), air ducts (you can close them), and vanity lights. Note how these lights are located behind the moon roof, so they don't blind the driver when it's dark. Very nice!

One complaint: the rear center seat belt came with the clip (the part that you move up and down on the belt) below the plastic round clip locked on the belt itself. The problem with this is that it wouldn't work at all! I had to take the car to the dealership to get it fixed. Something they should have found at pre-delivery inspection.

The A6 has four cup holders, two in front and two in the back. Personally, I'd never drink something in this car. The leather and the $41,400 price scare me too much. But, maybe you can.

<b>Driving</b>

Driving this car is fun! The tiptronic 5-gear transmission from Porsche works flawlessly, and it's reasonably fast. On the other hand, I'd be fooling myself if I were to compare it to a manual transmission. These are honestly too different to compare. Having a clutch to play with gives the driver a sixth gear you don't have with the auto, which is the neutral. While going down a steep hill, you'll miss this gear very much. And, of course, you can't play with the rpm in neutral when there is none.

At this time, I have not driven the A6 in rain, dirt, or snow; so I'll keep from commenting extensively on the all-wheel drive feature. The only thing I'll say is that this car really grabs the road. Tight round on-ramps can be done at 40 mph and you won't even hear the tires. Not only it's fun, but much safer.

<b>Safety</b>

<b>WOW!</b> This is quite a list: front airbags, side airbags on front and back (opt. for the rear seats), and a curtain of air for your precious head (front and back). Now add 4-wheel disk brakes with ABS, light alloy wheels for speed, and, for 2001, a four-piston-like brake that works much faster and better (bigger surface area and strength).

Not enough?

How about two fire walls? There are two of them in front: one for <i>you</i>, and one for <i>me</i>. <b>Just kidding!</b> There <b>are</b> two, but one is to push the engine down, while the other is there, just in case, to keep everything else from ever reaching you and your loved ones. They are clearly visible when you open the hood... check them out!

Then, there's all the aluminum Audi likes to use in their fancy cars, metal beams all over the place, etc. This car is just as safe as a Volvo, if not better.

<b>Conclusion</b>

If my mom didn't mind, I'd be happy to exchange this for my Jetta! The A6 Avant is a fine car, though it is geared more toward the middle-aged guys and girls trying to polish their looks and spend the money they worked so hard for, I think a 20-year old wouldn't look bad in one. If you have $42,000 to spend, or a bank willing to loan you something like that (similar to this case), an Audi would look great in your garage!

Keep in mind this car runs on Premium fuel only and mileage is not very good. I haven't made the math yet, but I don't think our family's A6 will even reach 20 mpg! I'll make sure to update this review as soon as the car reaches 5,000 miles. Until then, feel free to rate this accordingly. Also, please tell me in the messages section what you thought of the passage that starts at the asterisk (*). Is it boring, or simply unique?
Finally, feel free to send me e-mails regarding this car or any other I have written about. I'll be happy to tell you all I know.

<b>Remember to buckle up! :O) </b>
