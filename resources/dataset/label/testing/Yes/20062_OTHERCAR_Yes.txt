            Synopsis:
I purchased the Optio 550 1 day before a trip.  I did a quick read of the manual, charged the battery and was off.  The interface is very simple and the features are robust.  The zoom is the best in this camera range and the battery lasted an entire 1 week vacation of over 350 pictures!

Specs:
You can get the full specs at the Pentax website but the highlights are:
5.0 megapixels
5X Optical Zoom (I haven't used the digital zoom for still pictures but it goes to combined 20X).  Digital zoom only for movies
JPEG and TIFF files for still pictures
.MOV for movie mode
SD and MMC Cards for storage

My opinion:
I really wanted this camera and while local shops advertised it, it hadn't come in yet.  One local shop sold me a Canon and told me to return it when I came home for the Pentax.  I really didn't want to do that because cameras can get beat up on a trip, but decided to buy the Canon and used it around the house testing it for a week.  I liked the camera but it was a little heavy and I didn't find the interface to be that easy.  The day before I left, the camera shop called and said that the Pentax came in that day.  I went over right away and exchanged the camera at 7 pm.  I charged it overnight and then briefly read the manual which was pretty complete.  The next day I left for Ireland for a week.  I took pictures (mostly in clouds and rain or indoor in pubs!) and they turned out very well.  I took three short movies just to test the video (it's not what I'll use it for, but it's a nice little feature to have when I don't want to carry around a video camera).  When I got home, I uploaded it onto my PC very easily and my MAC very quickly.  While I took the battery charger, I never had to use it, 350 pictures and I still had plenty of battery left!  My last camera was a Canon Powershot (2 megapixels with no optical zoom) and I couldn't get 2 days of vacation pictures out of it.  The 5X Optical Zoom was very helpful and it's the feature that really sold me on this camera.  I noticed several things in comparison to my old Canon (like the shutter speed - time between pressing the button and actually taking the picture) is substantially better but I don't think it's fair to compare an old Canon and a new Pentax.  I do like the interface on the Pentax better than the Canon which hasn't changed much since my PowerShot.  The interface gives lot's of options including fully automatic (point and shoot), automatic for certain shooting conditions(portrait, landscape, night, flower, surf and snow, autumn colors, sunset, fireworks, text), or fully manual.  The camera fits nicely in your hand and it seems like it will hold up well with the metal case although only time will tell.

Ultimately, the pictures turned out very nice in all light conditions although I think the Canon had an easier (faster) time focusing in low light conditions.  The Pentax took longer to turn on than the Canon, but the battery on the Pentax far exceeded the Canon's.

I would highly recommend the Optio 550 but won't put down the Canon S45 that I tried for a few weeks because it was nice too.  Both took excellent pictures.  I chose the Pentax because I will use the bigger zoom, longer battery life, and easier interface more than the Canon advantages of faster focusing (especially in low light).
