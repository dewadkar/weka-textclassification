            My husband and I were looking for a family car since eventually we would like to expand our family. At first we thought about an SUV but went to the Toyota lot first and had love at first site with our camry. 

It provides alot of comfort and room. You could easily go on a long vacation with this car and not have to worry about feeling cramped up without any room.
Also it gets great gas mileage which is great with the increase in gas prices lately. 

We have the LE model which comes with alot of great security features. It has something called permavin in which they etch your vin number on all the windows of the car and guarantee that if your car was to get stolen it would be found. Also it came with a security system and a panic button. If you were to be in the parking lot and couldn't find your car or if you felt you were being followed by someone you could push the panic button on the key chain and it would set the alarm off.
I also liked that when you pushed the button to unlock the doors that it only unlocks the drivers door the first time you push unlock so you don't have to worry about anyone else jumping into any of the other doors if you are alone. 

I would reccomend this to anyone that wants a family car that is dependable.<br><br>
