            The GMC Suburban is the most reliable SUV I have ever driven. I've driven all of Ford's SUVs, and the Suburban topped all of them in almost every category. I believe that GMC/Chevrolet make the highest quality SUV, clearly shown in the Suburban.

One thing I like about the Suburban is its substantial amount of power and torque. The Suburban destroys its competition in towing power and comfort. The Suburban excels in its towing power, especially if you have a boat. My boat weighs two tons, and when I'm towing it to the lake, all the torque and power I want and need is on tap. 

Another thing I enjoy about the Suburban, is that it practically &quot;owns&quot; the road. People get out of my way when they see my big a-- Suburban coming down the road. The Excursion may be bigger, but it surely doesn't out-perform the Suburban.

A drawback of the Suburban though, as with all SUVs, is the amount of gas it consumes. I spend about 50 dollars and a half hour at the gas station when I need a full tank. Because of its size, the Suburban doesn't handle as well as I would prefer, but compared to Ford, and most other cars in its class, the Suburban rises above the standards.

If you want a reliable, fairly inexpensive SUV, that has four-wheel standard, and excellent power, than the GMC Suburban is the perfect choice for you.<br><br>
