            As I was driving to Orlando, I heard the commercial I'd been waiting for (ever since I became the disgruntled owner of a '96 Camaro):  &quot;...even if you're upside down, we'll get you out and into...&quot;  Suddenly, trying hard not to screech my tires in my excitement, I turned my car around and went straight to the dealership (so much for my plans in Orlando).

One brand new car saleswoman was my guide through the new vehicles on the lot.  My utmost desire (aside from getting out of that sickly Camaro) was an SUV.  But to my short-lived disappointment, an SUV was out of reach.  It was short-lived due to the simple fact that, over on the East side of the lot, with the sun's highlighting, I saw it.  The Frontier King Cab Dessert Runner.  It was my new dream!

That was seven months ago.  Today, I am still in love with my truck.  It sits high off the road (so my best friend's wife won't back into me claiming &quot;You were so low to the ground I couldn't see you) -no more oncoming headlights!  Great climate control.  I can control the passenger airbags (which is great since car seats aren't recommended for the rear jumper seats).  Even the bedliner is engineered for practicality:  it has slots so that I can insert various 2*6 boards to compartmentalize the bed liner into either three sections or a 'two-story' bedliner.  And tie-down hooks are available.  With a 2*6 board placed in the first slot from the cabin, I have a perfect place to put groceries, plants, tools, and other items to keep them secure.

If anyone ever questioned your testosterone level, they will doubt no more.  The Dessert Runner has masculine lines, manly fender flaring, chrome, respectable height (it's built on a 4*4 frame), powerful engine with great towing power, and a stereo system with a woofer and tweeters!  All this AND it is one of the quietest vehicles I've ever owned (at least in the cabin).

With all this, my dreams are met!<br><br>
