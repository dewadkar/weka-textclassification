            I feel qualified to write this since I have had 2 escorts. My first one was a brand new 94 LX hatchback, green with the spoiler and alloy wheels. While shopping for that car I looked objectively at other hatchback cars available, all the others in 1994 were over 14K - VW Golf, Ford Probe, Eclipse/Talon, or too small &amp; cheap - Metro, Aspire, Hyundai Excel. I drove the LX for 2.5 years and 65K miles, had no problems or repairs. I then traded for a 94 GT with 20K miles and an automatic, due to greatly increased traffic jams. I now have 91K on the GT, again with no major problems. 

Good points:
hatchback utility
gas mileage, 32-35 LX with 5 speed
Good ride, cornering &amp; manueverability, especially so on GT
Good equipment-every LX will have A/C, stereo, int. wipers, PS, PB
reliable, Ford parts &amp; dealers are everywhere for service
4 speed automatic - Neon still uses 3 on 2000 models!
Low price
Reliable

Weak points:
acceleration - only average with both, GT with 5 speed would be faster.
gas mileage-around 26-28 with GT automatic
Stereo-Standard stereo has poor sound-premium sound in GT a little better
Noisy over 60 mph-weak stereo doesnt help!
Rattles have developed over time
Cheap looking interior
Hard seats in GT
Automatic seatbelts are annoying

I feel like I got good value with both of these cars. I got the GT used with 20k miles on it, it came loaded with power windows, sunroof, cruise and premium sound, but I could live without these extras, the LX didnt have them.  Dont look for amenities like remote hatch and fuel door release, trip computer, automatic A/C, or CD &amp; cassette combo, you wont find them on any Escort. The car is fun to drive even with the automatic; it reminds me of my 85 Daytona Turbo automatic, since there seems to be no power until the transmission shifts down and the engine revs up. The steering has no slop and cornering is precise, and the car tracks well down the highway. The ride is a little stiff but I like that. The LX had a softer ride with less precise cornering, but the steering seems to be the same. The seats on the LX were also softer, neither car really has what I would call good seats, they dont support very well for long trips. The LX with 5 speed was OK on power, it just didnt have any extra oomph like the GT does when the tach swings past 3000.

I now have 91K on the GT, I just had the timing belt changed and a tube replaced on the intake system to cure rough running. Other than new spark plugs and wires at 52K this was my only expense beyond regular maintenance, and the timing belt was due at 60K anyway. The LX required no unscheduled trips to the shop in 65K, so both cars have been very reliable. The only real problem Ive had is a noisy speedometer, at highway speed it sometimes reads 5-10mph fast, both cars started doing this right after the warranty ran out and I just live with it. I replaced the Ford stereo and speakers, the sound quality is much better and I can now drown out the road noise at 75 mph. The GT is came with 185/50-15 Eagle tires, this size is rare so I replaced the tires at 42K with 195/50 Firestones and have been happy with them so far.

From reading the car mags and internet reviews, the 97 and newer escorts have improved on a lot of the weak points. However these models dont offer a hatchback, a big drawback for me. If you are looking for a reliable small used car the Escort is a good choice, Consumer Reports also agrees on this.
