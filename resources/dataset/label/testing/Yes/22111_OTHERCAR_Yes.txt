            I really love this camera.  I am a graphic-designer who creates photo calendars, photo business cards, etc.  Playing with photos is my passion.  But I always hated taking pictures and waiting until the roll was used up before I could develop them.  Then I had to wait another day for developing.  Finally, I had to scan the pictures into my computer before I could begin working on a photo project.

Not so with my Kodak DC215 Zoom.  I can take one picture, or 75 pictures at a time.  The camera has a review screen, so that if a photo does not come out well it can be deleted immediately (no more developing over- or under-exposed photos!).  At any point, I can plug the memory card into a mouse-sized USB CF Reader that transfers my pictures quickly and automatically into my computer, where they are ready to print!

We really enjoyed taking pictures after the birth of our daughter, and sending them by email to family and friends.  The pictures printed beautifully as well.

Here are some of the camera's specifications:
-Megapixel picture resolution: 1152 x 864 pixels
-color LCD
-4 flash modes (auto, fill, red-eye, off)
-10 second self-timer
-JPEG or FLASHPIX image files
-optional date stamp
-etc.

It comes with the follwoing:
-wriststrap and lenscap
-USB COMPACTFLASH card reader
-COMPACTFLASH removable memory
-Camera-specific software, as well as Adobe Photodeluxe and Pagemill, and Photo printer 2.0 (Photoshop for Mac systems)
-serial cable for Windows (adapter for Mac)
-video cable
-batteries, quick set-up guide, user's guide and registration card.

The camera also has lens kits and other accessories for purchase.

There are two minor drawbacks.  After taking a photo, the camera takes a few seconds to process the image, so two photos cannot be taken quickly in succession.  The camera also uses a lot of batteries.  Fortunately, rechargeables can be used with this camera, or you can buy an adapter to plug into an outlet.
