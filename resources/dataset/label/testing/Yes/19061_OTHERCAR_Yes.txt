            I'm not going to touch on any of the technical stats of the camera as this can be had anywhere. Instead I'll concentrate on how I use the camera, and what I see are the good and bad points of it.

<b>After Sales Value</b>

The Olympus 2020 is an affordable (relatively speaking =) ) 2.1 megapixel (1600x1200 images) digital camera. With the new crop of 3 megapixel cameras introduced in March/April 2000, the 2.1 megapixel cameras have been pushed down to the $400-$600 price range. At this price range, the camera makes a great buy for those that don't have to have the latest greatest everything all the time. Not only is your initial price lower, but so are the prices for the most costly of after-sales accessories, flash memory cards. Most Olympus cameras use the SmartMedia flash memory cards, which will run around $2-$3 per megabyte (the camera comes with a wimpy 8MB card). You'll be able to stuff a lot more images on your memory cards than your 3 megapixel friends, which is something to be appreciated once you see how much these memory cards cost!

<b>Got Pixels?</b>

If you've never printed an 11x17 print with a camera before, then you probably don't need anything more than 2.1 megapixels. I've printed out 8x10s with this camera set on 1600x1200 on high JPEG compression (the more JPEG compression, the smaller the files, but the 'noisier' the pictures), and they turn out beautiful. You won't be able to tell that it's a digital print unless you take a magnifying glass to it.

With the high JPEG compression, I can fit about 18-20 1600x1200 shots onto an 8MB SmartMedia card. I got in on the MobShop (http://www.mobshop.com) buy cycle for 8MB Unity Digital cards at $6 a pop (they have yet to return to the site, and I have yet to find a cheaper price / MB for SmartMedia) while back and was lucky to pick up 9 of those. Looking back I should have loaded up on at least another 9 or 10. Those were enough cards for myself on a two week vacation to London recently. If I had a 3 megapixel camera, I would have had to spend at least another $100 on the cards alone to fit the pictures I took.

<b>For Photographers?</b>

The reason why this camera appealed to me is that it was the cheapest camera at the time that had full manual control over exposure and aperature settings. It functions great in full automatic mode as a point and shoot, but having the manual controls as an option is nice for those shots that you want to have a little more control over. You can also mount filters on the end with the optional Olympus CLA-1 adaptor (about $15 at Buy.com). I generally lug around a UV filter and polarizer.

All that being said, it's great for consumer or light photo hobbyist. Professionals and more serious photographers would probably be dissapointed by the 3x (only) zoom, and the lag time which is common for digital cameras (seems to be just under a second for each shot).

<b>Convenience Features</b>

I love the battery life on the camera. It comes with a set of decent Sanyo NiMH batteries and a charger. Pick up a set of Kodak 1600mAh NiMH batteries as well, those ones just last and last and last and last. I took about 100 shots with those Kodaks over the course of 5 days, framing each shot with the LCD monitor before they died. Don't even think of using NiCAD or regular Alkalines in any digital camera, you won't get very far.

The camera also drains VERY little battery juice when its LCD monitor is off (which is not too common for digital cameras). I eventually got used to the slightly small viewfinder (adjusting for parallax and everything), and now and I don't even use the LCD at all. When I start the day I leave it on (it goes into standby mode after a few minutes), then I can quickly take shots when I need to instead of waiting the precious few seconds for the lens to extend or retract.  Battery life without the LCD will probably run you into the 200-300 shot range.

<b>Conclusion</b>

This is an EXCELLENT camera that I'd recommend to anyone looking for one in the $400-$600 range.  Shop around, you should be able to buy online from a reputable dealer for about $500. Its primary competition is the Nikon 950. The Nikon has far superior macro abilities, but very very poor red eye problems. The Olympus has a much more powerful flash that situated further away from the lens, thus reducing the red eye.
