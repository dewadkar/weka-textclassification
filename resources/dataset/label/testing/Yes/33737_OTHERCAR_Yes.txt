            While the 2000 Maxima has 222HP, the added power also comes with about a 200lb. weight penalty, so compared to my '95 Maxima the acceleration is of the new model is likely to be equivalent, while the cornering capability is likely to be reduced.  I've really enjoyed the '95, and its mechanical record is outstanding (oil changes and tuneups, no breakdowns in the first 50K miles), but in 4 years it has lost about $15,000 in value.  The good news to people who don't own one is that a used Maxima 3-5 years after the model year can be an outstanding value.

One of the things I've liked most about the '95 is the great power to weight ratio.  To put the performance information in perspective, I put together the following table of sporty cars, sorted by weight:

Year Make/Model........ Engine, L.. hp.... wt, lb. price.. accel 0-60
1979 Porsche 911SC......... 3.0L... 172hp. 2556lb. $8-17k
1986 Porsche 944........... 2.5L... 150hp. 3000lb. $5k
1991 Porsche 911C2................. 247hp. 3031lb........... 5.7 sec. 0-60
1986 Porsche 911........... 3.2L... 214hp. 3064lb. 
1998 Acura Integra Type R.. 1.8L... 195hp. 2577lb. $19,500
1998 Toyota MR2 turbo...... 2.0L... 200hp. 2888lb. $15,000.. 5.9 sec. 0-60
1998 Chevy Corvette........ 5.7L... 345hp. 3245lb.
1998 Toyota Supra.......... 3.0L... 225hp. 3265lb. 
1997 Ford Mustang Cobra SVT 4.6L... 305hp. 3404lb. $23,000
1999 Ford Mustang Cobra SVT 4.6L... 320hp. 3417lb. $28,000
1999 Chevy Camaro Z28...... 5.7L... 305hp. 3439lb.
<b>1995 Nissan Maxima......... 3.0L... 190hp. 3010lb. $8-12k</b>
<b>2000 Nissan Maxima......... 3.0L... 190hp. 3200lb. $26,000</b>
<b>1997 BMW 528............... 2.8L... 190hp. 3450lb. $28,950</b>
<b>1997 BMW M3................ 3.2L... 240hp. 3175lb. $28,995.. 5.9 sec. 0-60</b>
1997 BMW 540............... 4.0L... 282hp. <b>3803lb.</b> $32,900
1996 Nissan 300ZX.................. 300hp. 3502lb.
1998 Toyota Supra turbo.... 3.0L... 320hp. 3515lb. $21,900
1997 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4......... 320hp. 3737lb. 
1991 BMW M5........................ 310hp. 3804lb........... 6.1 sec. 0-60

The information on the chart is supported by my experience, that at the same horsepower as a BMW 328i, our Maxima with 400 pounds less weight can out-accelerate most BMWs.  I've even had a '97 Ford Mustang Cobra SVT (4.6L, 305hp, but a cumbersome 3404lb) have trouble passing, forcing me to get off the gas to let the guy make his exit (what is it about Mustang drivers, that if they notice you're in a hurry to get somewhere, they're always trying to turn it into a race?)

Given the current value of the '95, it has pretty compelling features and reliability favoring keeping it for another year or two, but when we have the budget for a new 2000 Maxima, with our kids growing out of the stroller and port-a-crib ages, we'll consider a used Acura Integra Type R or BMW M3 as a much sportier alternative that might retain resale value better.
