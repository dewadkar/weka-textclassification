            I love my digital camera.  I use it all the time.  I had been asking for one for many months and my husband said I could get one for Christmas.  As the months went by I had talked to many friends that had them and loved them.  They told me the features to look for.  I loved getting pictures of all their kids done with their digital camera's.  If we were talking about something online they would just run over take a picture of it and email it to me within seconds.

Christmas time finally arrived and my husband and I decided that it would be best to let me pick out my new camera since I already knew I was going to get it.  We went to circuit city and checked out what they had.  They had a large variety but there were only a few that had the features we wanted in the price range we needed.

We decided to choose the Mavica  FD73.  It takes the little floppy disks and does not need to be hooked up to your computer in any way.  You just slip in the disk and take your pictures and put the disk in to the floppy disk drive on your computer and can get all your pictures off your A drive.  This camera has a screen on the back so you can see what you are taking a picture of which was very important to  me.  I can flip through pictures I have taken and delete out the ones I don't like and when you take a picture others can see what you are taking a picture of.   It has a rechargeable battery that is very simple to use.  It tells me when the battery is low and I just take it out put it on the charger and it charges up.  The battery lasts for quite a while I am finding too.   Another important feature for us was the zoom.  We wanted a pretty good one and the Mavica FD73 has one that is 10x.

I love the ease of this camera.  You can look at your subject zoom in, make the picture lighter or darker, put the flash on different settings (it even tells you which flash you should be using), you can choose if you want to take a black and white picture or a picture with different effects like neg. art, sepia, or solarize.  You can program it to take night shots, action shots, bright light shots etc.  It has a little picture in the right hand corner of the LCD screen that shows you how much room you have left on the disk.  It has options that you can delete pictures or format your disk right on the camera. It has an option to look at each picture one at a time or put it on index and see all the pictures you took and than pick which one you want to look at by just clicking on that one.

I have had this camera for about a month and a half now and I have used so much! My family lives 3000 miles away and I have many on line friends and I love to send pictures of my family to them.  I can take candid shots of my kids and send them to my parents and within 5 min. of me taking the picture my dad can be printing them out at his house.  They really love to see the pictures coming so much.  An example is my 11 year old daughter just won a gold medal in a bible quizzing competition at our church.  I was able to take pictures of her with her medal and send them to our friends and family so they could share in our joy.

Another use I have for this camera is taking pictures for my auctions.  As I stated in my opinion of yahoo auctions I sell things on line.  It has been so much easier to take pictures of my items and put them in my auctions.  I used to have to lay things on my scanner to insert pictures but you could not get the whole item most of the time and bigger items like toys could not be scanned.  Now I can take pictures of anything and you get nice big,clear pictures.  That is another thing about this camera it does take very clear pictures.  I have had many comments from people that I am sending pictures to on how clear my pictures are and saying how good my camera must be. 

I guess if you have read this far you can tell that I am love in with my new camera.  Being a mom it is so important to document all aspects of my childrens lives and the fact that I can share with my mom and dad within minutes is priceless to me. I suppose some of the candid shots I can get and send quickly my kids might not appreciate later in life.  You know the ones with silly hats on, or food all over their faces when sitting in the highchair.  But that's part of the fun of having children.  This camera has made those moments possible and possible to my friends and family as well.  I feel we made a wonderful choice of a camera.  It has the options that we wanted, was in the $500 price range we needed, and most of all is very simple to use.  If I can figure out all the buttons and on screen options with out hardly having to look at the instructions you would have no trouble using this camera.
