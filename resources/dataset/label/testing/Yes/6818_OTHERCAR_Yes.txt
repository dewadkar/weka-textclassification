            We bought our Sable in February of 1999.  We had a Mercury Mystique and needed more room since we had another child.  Both car seats fit in the back and there's still room for another person.  I love the fact that it seats up to 6 people.  Driving this car is quite an experience!  It handles beautifully and is sound as a luxury car, but still has a sporty feel to it.  It's the perfect family sedan, in my opinion.  The body style is so pretty and the available exterior colors are good too.  I especially like the factory sound system.  It's within easy reach while you're driving.  The cruise control settings on the steering wheel is such a nice touch.  Another plus is my car seats fit perfectly in this car. I would definately recommend this car or a family. One other thing, the trunk is huge!!<br><br>
