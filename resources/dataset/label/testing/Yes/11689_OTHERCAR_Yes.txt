            My love affair with all things Lode Lane developed sometime in the early 70's, watching Merlin Perkins in his safari-ready Series IIA Land Rovers traveling the Dark Continent on Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Something about the square, spartan - absolutely no-nonsense look of early Land Rovers put notions of adventure in my young mind. 

The romantic ideal of the Land Rover marquee is very much the same now as it was then for most owners of any newer Solihull vehicle. Evidence the myriad publications, clubs and events for owners and enthusiasts the world over. In the San Francisco Bay Area alone there is no fewer than three organizations whose sole purpose is supporting the "fever Land-Rover", offering rally-type competitions and weekend safaris throughout the Western United States.

I've garaged several makes of SUV, including the popular (and comparably priced) Mitsubishi Montero, but never found a vehicle so absolutely captivating, fun, and at times � challenging to own as the Land Rover [Discovery].

The first factor, and perhaps the most potent driving criteria for deciding on ownership is the staggering cost to operate. I cannot emphasize enough, even on a used Solihull vehicle, that these are expensive vehicles to drive and maintain. Let it be said that I'm NOT made of money, and in most cases my purchase decisions are controlled somewhat by my budget. In this particular instance, I experienced an incredible (if well-informed) lapse in judgement. I had read two years worth of Land Rover magazines, researching the marquee and vehicles top to bottom before actually owning one.  Regardless, I�m still surprised how much money the Disco can evacuate from my account!

My wife reminds me quite often how expensive this vehicle is to run - daily I think! I'm no friend to the environment, not in emissions, but raw consumption. I average 300 miles on every 20-plus gallon tank of gas, and have made lifelong friends of the local filling station operators. Factory service - scheduled in 15,000 - 30,000 mile increments is expensive, around $600 dollars a pop. 

I've been lucky, having bought the car from a service online, to have taken delivery of a fully refurbished car with few glitches and a complete 3 month warranty. Other owners report incredible problems with electrical systems and laughable inconsistencies in fit and finish. I've been lucky, period. The reports of windows that won't roll up, locking systems that refuse to cooperate and transmission levers stuck in park are not rumors - they happen regardless of maintenance, dealer or otherwise, and appear to be "luck of the draw" situations.

My local dealer seems as perplexed as I over some of the issues I've brought to his attention. In addition to coming across just above incompetent in their knowledge of these vehicles, they have been condescending and rude in their delivery of service. Days - no, WEEKS - on end I've had my vehicle stuck in their care for the most rudimentary of fixes. Luckily, I was provided a rental car by the .com that sold me the car. I haven't any idea what everyone else does in these situations. If I made my decision for purchase based on the level of service I've gotten at a Land Rover dealer, I'd never buy one again. The very agent that collected the money should not shrug off a $35,000 customer!

While these stories of "British Quality Control" and customer service have done little to bolster sales in North America, this car is enticingly fun to drive. 

You feel absolutely unstoppable in these vehicles; they turn on a dime and have the most competent 4wd system on the road anywhere (Humvee notwithstanding).  A central-diff. locks the front and rear axle, providing unparalleled traction in all conditions. ABS brakes and true low-range (unlike most Lexus, Mercedes etc.) give ample towing and hill descent control. Die-hard off-road enthusiasts can easily disengage underbody anti-roll bars for Jeep-like wheel articulation under very extreme conditions. Only Toyota and Jeep offer as many factory and aftermarket products for enhancements on-road or off - try to find rooftop tents for your Ford Explorer!

The ride is smooth, and comfortable in the front bucket seats.  Most 1995 models came in leather � although cloth models were available.  The back seats offer a commanding view, with windows everywhere, including the distinctive Alpine glass above the load-space in the rear.  Seating for five or seven is not as comfortable as the front, and legroom for the six-foot and over set is tight.  The jump seats in the back fold down, but are only suitable for average-sized youngsters.  Dual sunroofs, and separate driver / passenger climate control with rear air-conditioning were common amenities in 1995.  Even my dogs in the very back enjoy multiple vents routing warm or cool depending on the season.

Despite the financial concerns, dealer woes and �roll-of-the-dice� quality I�ve not once regretted my purchase of my 1995 Land Rover Discovery V8i NAS (North American Specification).  Research the vehicle you�re purchasing � take it to a shop of incredible reputation and have it inspected, and then enjoy the most unique four-wheel drive vehicles anywhere! 

Cheers!
