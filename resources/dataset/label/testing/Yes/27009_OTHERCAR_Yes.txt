            Im a previous owner of the Olympus D-340R, a very cool point and shoot camera with awesome picture quality.  The only problem with it was that it didnt have Zoom, so I went and bought the Olympus D-450, attracted by its 3X zoom and 6X digital zoom and its low price, and I WAS EXPECTING the picture quality to be just as good as the Olympus D-340R.  Wow, was I disappointed!  
     
     While outdoor is just as good, Indoor is the problem.  Since I like to take pictures of interior architecture, I dont normally use flash so I can capture the true lighting of the place.  The problem is that interior pictures are GRAINY!!! The graininess scatters and dots a bunch of foreign colors to the pic like purple and such on the pictures. This makes the pictures look quite ugly indoors, and doesnt compare to the Cheaper Olympus D-340R (which has nearly professional quality graphics all the time).  Previous owners of the Olympus D-340R will recognize the difference with interior shots by comparing the 340 with the 450.  This is disappointing to me since I was expecting just as good photo quality as the product line goes up, not worse.   Nevertheless, the picture quality is great and especially great for taking outdoor nighttime pictures (just be sure to keep your hand real steady).
     As for other features, This camera is quite neat that it has many professional features like ISO settings, focus options, exposure compensation, etc..  The zoom is up to 3X, the equivalent of 105 mm, but Digital zoom will 2X it making the maximum zoom up to 6X or 210 mm, the only problem is that Digital zoom is fake by using cropping, so the picture quality isnt nearly as sharp as real zoom.  The only annoying thing is to have 
     The camera is pretty much easily portable and lightweight, very handy with a strong wriststrap.  The only problems with the exterior design is the buttons are more confusing than the Olympus D-340R, and some of the most used features have to be selected in the LED display, plus the camera goes off after a minute or two, erasing the options that you previously made.  Plus the LED drains so much battery power, especially when you use it as a viewfinder, that you'd better have strong rechargeable batteries.
 If your going to take pictures outdoors in the day or with flash then this camera is ok and just as great as the Olympus D-340R.  But for me that needs a good all purpose camera, it doesnt cut it.  <br><br>
