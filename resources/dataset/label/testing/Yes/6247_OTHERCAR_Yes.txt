            I bought a 1986 1/2 Nissan Pick-Up with the SE-V6, extend cab, rear sliding window, and bucket seats, six years ago for $3000.  This was the first year these babies (the Nissan V6 PU's) rolled off the assembly line. It had 175k miles on the original engine.  Well, now it has 252k miles and I have not had any major problems (yeah, the thermostat went and the H2O pump, but these things go).  I would DEFINITELY recommend buying a new Nissan with the SE-V6.  This may be the last vehicle you ever have to buy.  I do regular maintenance, but the engine is still quiet, it still starts after it turns over 1 or 2 times, and it still looks good (although  I don't recommend that Navy Blue - there was some factory problem and the paint just peels off in sheets, so it needed a new paint job when I bought it - the paint is the most money I've ever spent on the truck at one time).
  I have front bucket seats and the truck rides like a car.  I also recommend the Extend Cab, this way you can position the seat further away from the steering wheel which I find more comfortable.  The extend cab also allows room for your stuff, although it is too small for adults and probably too small for older children.  It will do in a pinch, but you don't want to have to rely on this truck to move more than two people.
  My interior is also sturdy.  It's worn, but still looks good (I don't know what they may have changed in the newer models). I LOVE MY TRUCK and plan on keeping it until it dies which does not appear about to happen in the foreseeable future.<br><br>
