            My wife was driving a leased 99 Toyota Camry LE. She didnt really care much for it. It was too blah for her. She sent me out to find her a vehicle which is hard enough. I had a figure in mind, about 32k was my limit that I didnt want to go through. 

It just so happened that my first stop was at an Infiniti dealership in Dayton, Ohio. (no kidding, first stop). I was very taken by the G20 and I-35. But, I wanted to look more since I had about two months until the lease ran out.

I didnt test drive it the first time, because I was only price shopping and didnt have time to take drives and run out of time. Anyway, after about a month of looking around for used and new, I had narrowed my choices down to the new Toyota Camry, Mercedes Benz C240, Cadillac CTS, BMW 325I and of course the Infiniti I-35.  I test drove all these cars and I had no second thoughts. The I-35 was the most smoothest.

Also, with the warranty and reliability guarantees, this car had everything we looked for. After much time in the dealership watching the wife pick out the car in the lot, we finally came up with the vehicle. It came with spoiler, sills, sunroof and all the extras for about 28k without tax. We decided not to do the sport package ($2000) or the DVD navigation system. Not something we would use on a regular basis.

The G-20 was a nice car too, but not as luxurious or as roomy. We spend alot of time trying to be frugal and think about a G-20. In the end, the I-35 was worth the extra 8k in money. 

The I-35 is the best car I have ever driven and it takes no time to get up to speed on the highway and merging traffic. It has quiet nature to it. Even with the sunroof open the noise level is very minimul. The safety features of the side airbags and rear heated passenger seats was a classy touch, along with the rear window sun-shade. I get easily amused with new technology. (The rear sunshade will be the first thing that probably wears out and breaks since I amuse myself my opening and closing, constantly)

I was disappointed in the Bose radio though. Seems kinda cheap and the wood grain is not real and feels like it.

The service department was also a big seller with the loaner car program. They dont want you driving anything but the car you drive. They will give you the same vehicle loaner car that you brought in for service. An I-35 for an I-35. 

I hate not buying American, but at $30k, sometimes I had to make the best choice for my and my family.  I have no regrets or second thoughts. Gas mileage is good as well as well as being a sporty model. Everybody wants to look good in a new car. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.
