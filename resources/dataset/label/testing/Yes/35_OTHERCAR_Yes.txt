            I bought this car because I wanted a large luxury car that was not very popular.  My previous car, a Cadillac, had been broken into twice and I had enough of window and dashboard replacements.  The Olds has turned out to be the most dependable car I have ever owned.  In 122,000 miles I have only replaced a water pump and an alternator.  Even the exhaust system is still the original equipment.  It has never failed to start, it runs like a dream, quiet and smooth. <br><br>
