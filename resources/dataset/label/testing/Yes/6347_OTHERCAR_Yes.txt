            Toyota's have long been known for their reliability and durability.  They run forever- and that's not a bad thing!  Very luxurious cars- plenty of room on the inside without looking big and bulky on the outside.  This car comes with plenty of small, useful perks, such as a miscellany holder on the driver's side, pull-out cup holders, and a console for tapes, CDs, or whatever else you may need to store.  Very sharp looking cars, both inside and out.  This is a great car for families, or those people who travel a lot.  The comfort offered by Camry's is immeasurable.  This particular model of the Toyota Camry gets 30 miles to the gallon- excellent gas mileage.  These cars are definitely worth owning!<br><br>
