            I started driving a mini van at the ripe old age of 24.  I am now 30 (and have added an extra 2 kids since then) and can't imagine ever driving anything else!!

This is my third mini van and I am in love.  I purchased it new in 1997 and now have almost 69,000 miles on it.  I spend two hours a day in it commuting to work and back home.

My favorite aspects:  It has the dual sliding doors.  The passenger side is automated and I have the cool remote control.  This comes in so handy when walking to the car with three kids and groceries...all I have to do is click the button and voila!  This also has some nice safety features so the door will not open unless the vehicle is in Park.  It can also be locked down by the driver to not open at all using the automatic controls.

Another great feature is the rear stereo controls.  My daughter can sit in the back, plug in her headphones and listen to the radio or a CD while I, sitting in the front can listen to a book on tape..at the SAME TIME!  This is a terrific feature especially on vacation.

This also has the most power of any mini van I've driven and I have often been compared to certain race car drivers!  I can accelerate while pulling a very steep hill with no problems.

The jury is still out on the traction control system that prompted me to go with the Montana as opposed to the regular Trans Port.  I don't see a whole lot of difference when driving in snow except for the fact that I now have a light on my dashboard that comes on when I have low traction and this gives me the chance to ease off on the gas.

It is very rugged and comfortable at the same time.  There is an abundance of room and I love the ability to take out half of the bench seat in the rear.  The leather seats are very easy to clean.  The driver seat will also flip forward to access behind it without opening the door.

There is also a cigarette lighter in the rear so anything (portable DVD Player, TV, coolers, etc.) that needs power can be run in the back of the van too. 

I also love having my stereo controls on the steering wheel.  I can change radio stations, mute the sound, fast forward a cassette or CD, ANYTHING without my hands ever leaving the wheel (this is also impressive to my 11 year olds friends!)

I usually get around 21 miles per gallon and that is with an even combination of city and highway driving.  The 25 gallon tank avoids too frequent fill ups too!

And, the look on peoples faces to see the sliding door open automatically before I ever get to the van is priceless!!

I highly recommend this vehicle and after I drive the wheels off of this one, I plan to buy another just like it!<br><br>
