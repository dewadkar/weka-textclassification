            WOW, we recently bought a used '94 Caprice Classic Wagon and I can't say enough good things about this car, I absolutely LOVE it.
We have to small children (car seats) and a small dog, that rides in her dog crate when we go somewhere, and this car has enough room for all of us and all our stuff if we are traveling.  It get GREAT gas mileage for such a big engine(350 dual exhaust) about 28 miles to a gallon.  I love the third seat that folds down totally flat. I sometimes go places with my girlfriend who also has two small children with car seats, we just fold up the seat and put the two older kids in the back and away we go.
 It rides like your floating on air, great big comfortable seats. It's like driving from a recliner.  The lady who bought it brand new had all the extras added. We have heated side mirrors for winter defrosting, a light sensing rearview mirror for driving at night, we someone behind us gets close the mirror will turn to a green tint so the lights are less annoying.  
The only downside that I can see is dual airbags, now I can never allow my children to ride up front until they are adult size.  I don't particularly even like driver's side airbags but didn't have much choice.  Another thing, they are not made any more so you would have to go for a good used car if you wanted one.
Overall A++ in my book.  I feel very safe driving such a big solid car.<br><br>
