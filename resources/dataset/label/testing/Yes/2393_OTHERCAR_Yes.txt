            My husband and i decided to purchase a digital camera cause i am famous for taking oodles of pictures and not get the film developed.  Plus it is soo expensive.  This way i can print out the pictures myself.   If memory serves me correctly i think you can take the little film card to get the pictures on disc and you can reuse the film card.  So it saves on buying film and getting roles of film developed!  My husband &amp; I purchased a Toshiba MR5 and we absolutely love it!   It takes great pictures it is very easy to use and easy to load into our computer, etc.    We were going to purchase the Olympus but we decided not too.  The main reason why we didn't purchase the Olympus was because we wanted something with more memory, more pixels, and a zoom lense.  After doing some research we found that the Olympus digital camera was cheaper but didn't have what we wanted!    Although the Olympus was rated one of the &quot;top&quot; digital cameras we found that the Toshiba MR5 was more money but it had all the features we wanted.  The Toshiba was more then we wanted to spend but it has a $100.00 rebate.  And due to a special going on at a certain computer store, we will get about half of the money back plus the 100.00 rebate!  So we got it for almost the same price the Olympus was going for but we have more memory &amp; better features etc.  When we compared the two digital cameras they both seemed nice but we wanted to have a camera that had more memory, more pixels and definitely a zoom lense.    So i do highly recommend this camera if you ever decide to purchase one!   Like my dad says you get what you pay for!  LOL<br><br>
