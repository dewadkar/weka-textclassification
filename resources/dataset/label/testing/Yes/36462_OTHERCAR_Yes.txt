            I leased this car at the end of April 2002, and have put about 4K miles on it since then. I am very happy with my purchase. First of all, our dealer had a flat-price, no-haggle deal, which eliminated having to bargain with salespeople. I was able to pick out the car I wanted reasonably quickly.

This one is a 2.5 S, which will probably be the most common trim line sold. It has power locks, windows, CD player, 6 speakers, automatic transmission, and air standard. It also has 16-inch wheels, albeit steel. Aluminum alloy wheels are only available on the up-level 2.5 LE.

This vehicle is exceptionally roomy. Even six-footers will fit very comfortably. In fact, its wheelbase is longer than that of the flagship Maxima.

One of the best features of the Altima is the new family of engines. For most people the 4-cylinder 175-hp 2.5 liter engine will be more than enough. It runs well on regular fuel, and I get about 380 miles of mixed driving on one tank. The fuel tank on the Altima is one of the biggest in its class -  20 gallons.

If you want more power, the 3.5 liter 6-cylinder in the 3.5 SE is ferocious. It is rated at 240 hp and is only marginally less powerful than the one in the Maxima (255 hp). Be prepared to pay more, though - most SE models are well over 23k and premium fuel is recommended for the bigger engine.

The Altima is not quite as refined and quiet as a Camry, but definitely has more character and feels sportier. When my lease is up I may get another one - unless my finances at that point let me go up to a Maxima.
