            I got a new 98 model Eclipse GS when I graduated from high school. Two years later, I still love my car. Nothing can beat the sporty and stylish look of the Eclipse, and it is super fun to drive!

Things I love about my Eclipse:
-the leather seats are very stylish

-5-speed transmission: gears shift smoothly...clutch is easy to work

-the sunroof is a must

-it accelerates pretty fast, actually has a higher top speed than I would have thought

-the heat/air conditioning system is really good - it heats up really fast in the winter and cools off equally fast in the hotter months

-cruise control is an added bonus

-the factory speakers that come in the car are pretty good - I am really into music and I didn't feel the need to replace them or upgrade to better speakers in my car - the sound is clear and loud, and doesn't vibrate too much at high volume/bass levels like most factory speakers do on a lot of car models

Things that aren't so good about it:
-it's small - friends sitting in the back sometimes hit their heads on the ceiling when going over bumps and they complain of an uncomfortable ride (who cares? it's my car, not theirs)

-not much room in the hatchback for things. When travelling from school to home (in the summer when I move home), I have to rent a large truck or van to transport my stuff

That's about it. I'd recommend the eclipse to anyone.<br><br>
