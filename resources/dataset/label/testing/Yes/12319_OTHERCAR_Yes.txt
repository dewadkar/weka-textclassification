            i leased this vehicle because i have wanted one for four years ever since my junior year at college. i love the bucket seats and that your head only shows above the door no shoulders, real sporty. the eclipse has a lot of pep.  the sound of the engine when i start the car brings a smile to my face, need i say more???? girls in their mid 2o's who can afford it should buy or lease this car. this car should not be driven carelessly, especially in the rain.  it is very lightweight and can turn easily. the standard power door locks and windows is wonderful.  the spoiler definitely gives this car a sweet look.  be careful when choosing black because of dirt and heat. i was smart and got white. windows will also be tinted. when i am ready to sell it ill let you know.  but do not hold your breath too long because this car looks like a keeper to me.<br><br>
