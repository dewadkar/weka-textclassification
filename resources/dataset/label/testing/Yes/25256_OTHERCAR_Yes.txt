            I have owned this car for a period of just over a year and was pretty satisfied with it. It is a nice family sedan with plenty of room and power. 

From all Japanese cars that I&#146ve owned, or that my friends and family owned, this brand has the best feel. It feels rock solid on the road &#150 a feeling more common to German or Swedish cars. The handling is very good, it is capable of taking on the twists and turns like a sports car. It is also fairly smooth and quiet on the highways at 70-80 miles per hour. 

The car is well built, and feels like more expensive cars inside. The interior fabrics and dashboard materials are very high quality, the imitation wood trim is not easily scratchable, and the controls for heating and stereo system are very well laid out. The visibility is pretty good also except for rear visibility &#150 the trunk line drops off sharply and when backing up you can&#146t see where the trunk ends.

Engine is probably one of the most powerful and smooth engines in this class. The 2.4 155hp engine is very smooth and has seemingly endless supply of torque (pretty impressive for a 4 cylinder engine). It rarely made the transmission downshift even while going up pretty steep grades. The transmission is pretty smooth, but could be smoother. Suspension and chassis give the car that rock solid feel common to Germans, there were no rattles, to squeaks on tight corners. This car can handle potholes very well also (I have frequently traveled to Seattle to work, and the roads never get repaired in Seattle). Thanks to a relatively high clearance, you can also enjoy occasional camping trip via forgotten forest roads, as I did a few times. 

There are several factors to watch out for in this car: when buying used &#150 make sure it has not been a rental car as it will kill the value of the car and render the car untradeable. The other one to watch out for is paint job. When I bought mine, I did not take into account those two factors and in the end it was a pain to find a dealer to trade this car to, nobody would give me a trade-in value for it, even though it was in very decent condition. One way to find out if a car has been a rental is the suspicious price, usually $2000 or more under retail blue book value. This is not to say that if you bargain hard you couldn&#146t knock off few bucks, but when the dealer advertises the car with a price already dramatically reduced, and then if you bargain he takes even more off, it looks pretty suspicious. 

When I wanted to get car of my dreams (brand spanking new VW Golf) and was trying to trade the Nissan in, all dealers would bring up the rental fact, and that was the end of conversation. Really, why would they pay me trade-in price for my car, when they could go to dealer auto auction and buy two same cars for the usual trade-in price of one (one dealer actually told me that he could get the car like mine at the dealers rental car auction for about $6000 if he bought 5 or more, that just killed my mood, as I was already upside down on my loan).

The other problem is paint on the front of the car. It really easily gets chipped. And it is not just because it was rental and was driven on highway a lot. I have seen the same issue on other Nissans and Infinities that were 2-3 years old. I mean, the paint on the front should not look 10 years old and have 10 years worth of rock chips after 20000 miles and 1 year of driving. 

The seats even though feel plushy and soft, are only good for couple of hours. When I was driving it to California, I had to stop every hour and a half to take a break because the back was killing me, that's what soft seats do to you (as I am only 25, and didn't have such a problem with my new VW Golf, I could not find any other reason for the back pain). They have more of Cadillac feel to them and are not good for a long trips.

Overall, if you plan on keeping your car for a long time and chipped paint on front does not bother you, this is a very nice car, that is also very reliable day to day transportation. Not to mention the fact that if you not worried about buying a rental, and know for a fact that car that you are getting has been a rental, you can get a heckuva bargain. Considering the fact that rental agencies, maintain their cars probably better than many owners do, I would buy it without hesitating.
