            I've been driving VWs long before my legal driving status.  My grandfather introduced me to a standard VW Rabbit over 10 years ago.  I bought a Jetta from him and he helped me look for the '96 Passat GLX VR6 I now drive.

My VW experience just keeps getting better.  It would be hard for me to find a car that performs, rides, and looks like a Passat GLX without a price tag of over $30,000.  

Base Engine Size: 2.8 liters 
Base Engine Type: 6 cyl 2.8 L 
Horsepower: 172 hp @ 5800 rpm 
1/4 Mile: Just over 15 seconds

Some of the perks: Air Conditioning, Alarm System, Aluminum/Alloy Wheels, Anti-Lock Brakes, Cruise Control, Dual Air Bag Restraints, Fog Lights, Heated Power Mirrors,  Remote Trunk Release, Traction Control System, and Trip Computer.

I've added full leather, a CD changer, silver tint, and power moon roof.

I completely enjoy the Hawaii nights with the windows down, roof open, and heading to the coast.  I also enjoy rolling the windows up, turning up the music, and maneuvering seamlessly in and out of the congested afternoon Honolulu traffic.

I would only recommend a standard transmission in the Passat as you lose too much of its performance if you rely on an automatic.  You will also get better gas mileage; I definitely save money with the prices like they are on the island.

The only negatives to the Passat in Hawaii are itï¿½s unique parts.  I pay quite a bit extra for an oil filter made in Germany.  I also use Goodyear Eagle GA tires that have to be specially ordered well before installation.

Tire solution: the original equipment(OE)is a 215/50-15 H. If you want to stick with the 15" rim, your only solution is moving to 195/65-15, 205/60-15, or 215/60-15.  The final size is about the fattest tire you can put on the Passat with the 15" rim.  You can find dozens of more tires with these new specs, however, you are still going to have to change from the OE.
