            As my friend was driving his mother's ML430 down a long stretch of road, he smelled a hint of gas. Then, an overwhelming smell filled the compartment. He opened the windows and looked in the rear view mirror, there was gasoline EVERYWHERE. Now, wait - this is the 3 pointed star - the car of all cars - the prestige...all pouring out the back of a $50,000 Mercedes SUV. It turns out, the fuel line broke apart and as he drove harder, it opened up - luckily he wasnt killed by say, i small spark or any friction under the car. Interesting, a mercedes almost murdering a valued customer for the past 10 years. Not really, mercedes has been having reliability problems with its M-Class - WHY? Because they are built in AMERICA. Because of high demand, they used their DaimlerChrysler ability to open a plant in alabama (i think). Ok - whats wrong with american cars? well, not much really - but this is a german car - with supposed German mercedes quality -  NOT BEING MADE IN GERMANY.
Well, this car also drives alot more harsh than the other midsize suv's in its class. We battled - i said ML430 - then i heard Lexus RX300. I was finally won over by the fact the lexus was A. Faster, B. More Reliable, C. Actually Safer, D. Has better fuel economy, E. Better service - and last but not least the Mercedes way of doing business makes even someone who &quot;has&quot; feel like he &quot;HASNT&quot;. they will not make a deal - they say $50,000 or get out of here. When our e320 needed a tune-up they treated us as if we were pauper's begging for oil. in response we changed services and used a private person (great choice) to fix our cars. Now, there are benefits for owning a benz - but the M-Class needs more refinement. The E-Class, S-CLASS, SL roadster - great cars. The others are due for some work - im sure in the future mercedes will get its act together and admit they were wrong with the M-Class, and refine it to begin to pummle the competition as i wished it did before we got the lexus. Also, the car is ugly. but then again most suv's are. Bottom line - its a benz that drives like a truck.<br><br>
