            We have had our 1999 Oldsmobile Silhouette for three months now.  It is everything I wanted it to be.

We looked at every domestic make and model of mini-vans around before we bought ours.  Comfort and price was our major influences.  

The split benches are great!  They fold up compactly when you need extra cargo space and recline for comfort.  There is so much more leg room in this van than the Ford Windstar.  

The rear stereo controls are a great hit with the kids and me because I don't have to listen to the same stuff they are listening to.  The rear heat and A/C controls are great too.

Our van has four doors.  The drivers side rear door doesn't get used as much as I thought it would, but that is probably because the other rear door is an electronic door with remote control.  I think this is an excellent feature.  It comes in handy when we take my elderly mother-in-law with us.  We don't need to get out to open and close the door for her.

So far we haven't had any problems with the engine or any other parts.  The Oldsmobile roadside assistance really does bring reassurance and peace of mind.

I was a little disappointed in the gas mileage.  We only average about 22 mpg.  I guess this is about normal, but with gas prices every miles helps.<br><br>
