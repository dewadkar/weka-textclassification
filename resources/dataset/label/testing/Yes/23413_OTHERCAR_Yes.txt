            I am an ex-Service Consultant from an multi-line GM dealership. Whenever an Intrigue,Aurora, or Alero would drive into the service lane, we would have to look very closely to determine what body the car actually was. The shape of the Intrigue is very appealing but Olds went too far with the cab over,rounded corner design. All of Olds newest styles look alike. Dont get me wrong,these cars are a vast improvement over what they replaced. The Intrigue is tops in drivability,handling,reliability,etc. The problem with the rack and pinion popping in the earlier model seems to have been resolved. The steering is very precise and that can cause concern with the older set who are not used to a sports car feel in their Oldsmobile. This is definitly not you father's Oldsmobile. More power then the blue hairs can use and better fuel mileage. As in all American cars, the use of plastic interior moldings still is a major source of the irritating squeaks and rattles. Also the chrome strip at the top of the doors still moves and binds against the rear doors on both sides. Hey,Oldsmobile engineers!-How about a tiny chrome screw to resolve this problem? Overall, this is a very good car in an overpriced car era-you actually get what you pay for for once. Compare the Intrigue to the Aurora-almost the same car for far less of your hard earned dollars!<br><br>
