            When first looking for a new car, the first place that I went to was the Saab dealership.  I immediately was taken by the 9-5, by it's luxurious leather interior, to it's incredible handling around tight corners.  Reasonably priced, I immediately bought this luxurious car.  I also love all of the options included in this car.  My friends always comment on the heated rear seats during the winter, one of my favorite options included in the car.  Also, the headlight wipers keep them bright on dark roads and alleys.  The fog lights are also very useful in dense fog.  Without them, I couldn't see more than 50 feet in front of the car, but when on I could see much farther up the road.  The engine is also very nice in this car.  When the sport option is engaged, the engine picks up very nicely.  I love the feeling when pushed into the seat of my car.  Also, the gas mileage is very good on road trips as well as in the city.  Overall, this is one of the greatest cars that I have ever test-driven and bought.  This is a must buy.<br><br>
