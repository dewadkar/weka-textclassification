            In 12/99 I bought a '97 Grand Cheerokee Laredo 4x4 w/67K mi.  It has performed admirably for 4K miles now.  To make sure that I was comfortable with Jeeps, I checked with the *service departments* for four different shops and they had a great deal of praise for the durability of the vehicle.  One did explicitly recommend a warranty be purchased just in case, but said that there is unlikely to be any surprises mechanically.

The visability when driving is good.  The handling is...like a truck.  It handles better than many trucks I have driven including the old style Ford Explorer.  It handles similar to the Toyota 4Runner and new Explorer.  It handles worse than Mercedes' M-class.  

I have heard that rattles in the middle dash area is a place where this car does not age well.

Problems with my car over time: muffler has appearance of rust, even thought it has never been driven in the salt; cloth seats look far more weathered (wrinkled, creased) at 67K mi. than did an old BMW of mine at 140K mi.; quiet rattle in center console is developing on mine Jeep too; gas pedal wobbled side-to-side; wheels went out of alignment easily.

This must be a car that works well for others too, because I have to see not only the design, but also the exact color multiple times during a day.

I am not a big SUV fan, but this is a good car and the design was well executed.<br><br>
