            I was sceptical about switching from the regular 35mm camera to a small , hand held KODAK DC215 ZOOM DIGITAL CAMERA but once I figured out how to use both the camera AND the awesome ADOBE PHOTOSHOP software that comes with the camera I was in HEAVEN!!!!!!!
This camera is a GEM!!! I do a lot of book sales on E-Bay and badly needed to get out of trying to use my stupid scanner[%$@#%&amp;*%%!!!) to get photos with my ads and now I can sit here at the computer , pick up this handy camera , plugged into the AC adapter [I went through 8 AA batteries the first 3 days until I bought the adaptor for $19.95 online. NB..Do NOT PAY MORE FOR IT !!!..some places wanted up to $50 !!]..and I can take a few photos of each book I sell right at my desk here, then quickly acquire them in the software, adjust the framing and brightness, contrast and color qualities in a few seconds and BINGO..I'm set to add them to my E-Bay ads !! TOTALLY AWESOME !!
I did a LOT of research online before buying this camera ..and it PAYS [GOTTA LOVE THE INTERNET !!] and was convinced from all the reviews I read that it was by far the best deal , quality and price-wise. The photo quality even on the lowest level is very good indeed. I studied photography for two years full time a while ago and feel that I have  a critical eye that is not easily satisfied !!
Naturally it is VERY 'SEXY' to be able to take  a photo one minute and have it sent to someone across the country the next minute ..and that aspect applies to all digital cameras ,for sure, but this Kodak DC215 ZOOM is totally remarkable.

You MUST use the AC adapter or have a ready supply of RECHARGEABLE NIH batteries ready at all times. With the long extension cord to the AC adaptor that I bought I can easily plug it in and still move around somewhat to take photos while the AC is hooked up and thereby avoid using batteries except when I am outside.I would avoid using the rear LCD screen as much as possible as it is a real battery drain and it is not really necessary to be using it that often. Nevertheless...the LCD feature is VERY easy to use when making changes in quality or..when removing photos you are done with..NO MORE FILM TO WORRY ABOUT..ain't life grand !!!

I got mine from Staples for $299.99 with an EXTRA 64MB card ( it was on special) BUT..and PLEASE NOTE!!!! STAPLES CLAIMS THAT THEY WILL MATCH ANY LOWER PRICE YOU CAN FIND...and THAT is easy online..I found the same camera advertised online for $245 ( a $55 saving ). HOWEVER it was like PULLING TEETH to get them to honor the deal (scumbags)and they REFUSED to include the advertised extra 64MB card in the deal so..consumer advocate that I am and not being easily dissuaded from getting my due rights , I wrote to my State Consumer Affairs Dept and they forwarded my complaint to Staples. Pretty soon the phone rang and I not only got the 64MB card mailed to me but also got a $50 gift certificate !!! All in all the camera end up costing me about $150 !! Pays to squeal you know!!

I think that if it had been available for the same price i would have gotten the Millenium version of this camera..retails about $325 if you shop around because it has 8MB of storage (vs 4MB) and also has a USB connection which is much faster apparently..but..like my friend John says..whose in a hurry!!

Hope this helps someone make up their mind..I would be quite happy to answer questions..Dylanlad@aol.com

PS..added later...
I have now experienced this camera more and have the following to offer.
The close up feature is SO AWESOME...clarity you would not believe..I have used this a lot to copy hard copy photographs so could 'manipulate ' them on Adobe Photoshop and the results were remarkable.
One feature that DID trouble me was that I think that the shutter speed is too slow for some applications. I took some photos at my son's school musical[with the flash shut off..remember there is no film so therefore there is NO DISCOLORATION when you 'print' anymore from using indoor film without a flash] and I didn't get a shot that was truly focussed. I think it was partly the shutter speed and partly the high volume of focussed light in a black environment which may have been too much of a contrast for the built in exposure 'metering' and confused it..even with your eyes in that situation things take on a blur..who knows...? It is a rare event anyway..all other features are beyond expectations.
