            If you are looking for an entry level 1.3 mega pixel digital camera and don't want to spend a bundle, consider the Sony Cybershot DSC-S30. Pricing on this camera is down to about $300, and you get the camera, a great rechargeable battery with recharger, 4 MB memory stick (more on this later), imaging software, USB cable, and a cable for connecting the camera to a television. But, if you plan on taking high resolution pictures and printing them....BUY A LARGER MEMORY STICK! 

If you purchase a camera and memory stick, Sony is offering a $50 dollar rebate. At current pricing, you should be able to get a 32 MB memory stick for a very few extra bucks (after the rebate). Personally, I purchased the 64 MB memory stick ($114 before rebate), which will give me the ability to shoot 80 high resolution shots before having to download or erase shots. The woefully inadequate 4 MB stick only allows 5 high resolution shots to be stored.......useless for most people. Now, if your just doing e-mail shots, the 4 MB stick lets you take around 57 shots.

CAMERA FEATURES (Highlights) - check the Sony Web Site!

    1.3 Mega Pixel (interpolates to 1.6)
    2" "free angle" LCD
    6X Digital Zoom
    Built in flash
    Image modes: 1472x1104, 1280x960, 1280(3:2) 1024x768, 640x480

EASE OF USE: This camera, considering the number of features that can be controlled manually, is fairly easy to use. The on screen menu is easy to navigate, and you do have to know how to get your settings adjusted for what you want to do, such as image size, flash or not, etc.  But, once you make a few settings, you can use this camera as a basic point and shoot.  But, if you want to be more advanced, you can take advantage of many features such as the macro mode (works really well!), landscape mode, twilight mode, special effects (black & white, sepia, solarize and negative art. My only criticism is the lack of an optical viewfinder when you are in bright sunlight....although the LCD screen brightness can be adjusted, it can be difficult to see. In other situations, the lack of an optical viewfinder is minimal once you have used the camera for a while.

EASE OF DOWNLOADING: With the USB cable, downloading is quite easy and speedy, and the included software is easy to use. You will need to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, and if you do, you should be able to get up and running fairly quickly.  If you are new to computers and digital cameras, it might be helpful to get some help from someone who has some experience....I say this regardless of the camera/software package you buy!

PRINT QUALITY: For 4x6 or 5x7 prints, the Cybershot DSC S30 will please most users.....and I am quite happy with the prints I can generate.  Let's be honest....a 1.3 mega pixel camera will not replace a good 35 mm SLR camera.....but for all around snapshots, most people will be pleased. Keep in mind that if you want great prints....you need a good printer and quality photo paper. I'm quite happy with the prints I can produce with my HP 720C printer and photo quality paper.

MY TWO CENTS ABOUT PRINT QUALITY AND COST! If you want the greatest prints, you will have to spring for higher priced and higher resolution cameras...around a thousand bucks! If you are as frugal as I, you'll wait until that technology becomes more affordable.....I didn't want to spend more than $400....so with that limitation, I'm pleased with the DSC S30 digital camera.
