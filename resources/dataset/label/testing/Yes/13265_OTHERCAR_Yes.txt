            I love Hondas.  I've had three now.  The first was 11 years old and going strong when I wrecked it.  The second (a beloved Honda Civic Coupe) had to be given up so I could get a 4-door, and I chose the Accord.  Man, I love this car.

I've never had a problem with any of my Hondas.  They are consistently reliable cars with good gas mileage and great design.  

I got the nicer Accord with CD player, sunroof, auto windows and locks, and automatic transition.  I've had it about 6 months now and I like it more everyday.  Even without the V-6 engine it has plenty of pickup.  The sound system is great.  The interior design with pockets for sunglasses and such are also handy.  Mainly though I just wanted a safe, reliable car since I have a baby, and this car fits the bill 100%!<br><br>
