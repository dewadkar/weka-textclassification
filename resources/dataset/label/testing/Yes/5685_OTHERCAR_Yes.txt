            My wife and I recently purchased the Mazda Minivan, primarily for my wife to drive.  We bought it in Texas and will be moving to California.  I knew we would need a vehicle with more interior space and one that is more suitable for long distance driving than the 98 Mazda Protege we traded in. 
Personally I'm not the type of person to drive a minivan.  I'm more of a sports car type of guy.  I will need to buy myself a car once in California. 
I'm not going to go over all the cars features and options, etc., but rather give you some of my unique impressions after logging 100 miles.

Cons: 
This minivan has got to have the most uncomfortable driver's seat I have ever had the opportunity to plant my narrow butt in. The seat bolster is constantly irritating my left thigh and buttocks.  I can't scoot over to the right far enough to get comfortable.  Will definitely have to purchase a seat cushion to rectify this.  I don't know about the other seats, since I haven't really sat in them much. 
Another minor squabble with the driving position is while I am 6 feet tall with somewhat long legs, my right knee is constantly in contact with interior trim.  If I move the seat back much further it then causes me to be too far from the steering wheel. Neither of these gripes are deal killers, but rather comfort issues, especially for long trips.
Another annoyance is the gear selector that is mounted on the steering column.  The selector for the windshield wipers is in close proximity to it, and on several occasions I grabbed it instead of the gear selector. It also gets in the way of the radio controls. 

Pros: 
I am satisfied with the 200 hp, 3 liter engine. It moves it well enough down the road.  The engine is also silky smooth.
The suspension is firm without being jarring.  It also provides good communication to the driver, unlike Chrysler Minivans that give a floating, isolated feel.
The stock 4 speaker stereo is sufficient enough.  Not exactly good, but not bad either.  In the middle of the road I guess. 
The van has plenty of storage and flexibility as one would expect from this type of vehicle.
I must also applaud the visibility. Large side mirrors and large clear glass gives a good view all around. Blind spots are virtually non-existent.
