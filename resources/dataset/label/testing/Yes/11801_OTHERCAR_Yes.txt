            I bought my Suzuki Esteem in 1998.  It was a "program" car (meaning, I think, that it had been used as a rental car before I bought it) and had about 15,000+ miles on it.  My choices at that time were the Suzuki Esteem and a Dodge Neon.  The Esteem seemed a little sportier than the Neon and my daughter like the color better - a cobalt blue - so I bought the Esteem.

The Esteem is a compact, four-door, sedan with a 4 cylinder engine.  I would have liked a V6, but the Esteem only comes in the 4 cylinder.  I get pretty good gas mileage with the 4 cylinder, so I shouldn't complain.  The car has cloth seats in a nice multi-gray color with bucket seats in the front and a bench seat in the back.  A stereo with cassette player came standard on the car.  The windows are manual, but the Esteem does come with the option of automatic windows.  A nice feature of the car is the driver and passenger side air bags -- something you usually don't see in a car this economical.

I've had the car almost three years and have put over 30,000 miles on it so far, so it has about 45,000 miles on it total.  I've had no problems with it except a flat tire, which has nothing to do with the reliability of the car.  I take it in for the regularly scheduled maintenance and oil changes every 3000 miles.  

It's not the sportiest of cars, but it is dependable and has been trouble-free so far.
