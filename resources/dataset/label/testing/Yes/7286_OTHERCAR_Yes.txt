              After exhaustively searching Epinions, reviews, manufacturers literature and the Digital Photography Review web forums, I decided to purchase the D-460Z as my entry into digital photography. I paid $302 (vs $349 list at the time). I tried a number of the "low ball" dealers, but most of the lowest would only sell at their listed price when you purchased a number of accessories at inflated prices. If you refused to buy accessories, they would say delivery would be at least 30 days. I finally purchased from PC Rush/Atman in LA - no problems - 4 day delivery.
   I have had the camera for just over 2 months and have taken well over 1000 pictures. The directions in the manual were a little confusing at first, but after a little use, everything became clear. The point-and-shoot qualities and 3X optical zoom make it very similar to my Yashica Zoomate 140 35 mm. The D-460Z is as easy to use as the 35mm. 
   After experimenting with the different picture quality modes, I settled on SHQ. I get very good 8 x 10 prints with this mode (on a color laser printer). The quality of the pictures with the D-460Z is generally as good as the 35 mm, but somewhat more saturated. This is easily adjusted in any of the software programs available. The only pictures that are not as good as     35 mm are ones with  high contrast.
   Using Olympus's Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, I have taken 450 and 460 pictures before getting a low battery warning. This comprises about a dozen flash pictures, 2-3 Macros, and constant use of the Zoom. I only use the LCD for Macros and for setting options and erasing the media card.
   Built in USB would be a plus, but I bought a ZiO reader, which is cheap and simple to use. I generally use a 32 MB card and carry the 8 MB that came with the camera as an extra.
   A carrying case specific to the camera would have been nice too. I purchased a padded 2 compartment bag from K-Mart for less than $10 that hold the camera with room to spare in one compartment, and extra batteries, media, and copies of instructions for features I don't use very often (it helps to be able to use them when you need them) in the other compartment.
   After the equivalent of 2 rolls of film, using both cameras with identical or similar shots, I have retired my 35 mm. I will keep it around for special uses.
   I now take  as many pictures as "the spirit moves me"
and I generally save them all to my hard drive, then eventually to CD. I print the ones I want at any given time, in any size I want, and on any stock I want. If I take 1 or 2 pictures, and want prints right away, there is no wasting of film or waiting for processing.
   The money spent on this camera was one of the best investments I have made.
