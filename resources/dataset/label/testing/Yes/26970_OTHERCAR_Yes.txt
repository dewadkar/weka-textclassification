            This is my first car I have ever bought.  I had an old junker that was about to bite the dust, so I was going to trade it in towards a new car.  They were only going to give me $600 for it, and that wasn't going to cut it.  So while I was thinking about it coming home from work one day, I accidentally rear ended this guy and ended up totalling the car.  So to my luck, if that's what you call it, I got $2000 from insurance to cover the car.  So I went in to buy the vehicle, but had a rough time negotiating price.  I don't know if all Mitsubishi dealers are this way, but they wouldn't barge on the advertising fee.  They charge a $600 fee for the Galant, and almost twice that for the SUV's.  I was in desperate need for a car, so decided to pay the full price, but I recommend you shop around for something more in the $200 range if they will give it to you.  Advertising fee is tax deductable for the dealer, and let them know you know that.  So on to the car....

This car is pretty solid.  It takes turns great, rides fairly smooth, and brakes are very good.  On the downside, the transmission is still a little jumpy.  I have put 2000 miles+ on it, and it is not as smooth as I thought or it should be.  You really can feel it shifting gears.  And it only took a couple hundred miles for a panel above the door to start rattling.  That really anoyed the hell out of me.

If you are looking for a great looking car, with a better price tag, than the leading Camry and Accord, this is a good car.  It ranks right up there with those two, with a bigger engine at about the same price.  If you're a family of Four or more, and the car is for primary transportation I wouldn't recommend it.  The rear seats are pretty cramped if you want ample leg room in the front.<br><br>
