            I've owned my Rendezvous for a little more than two weeks ... it has 580 miles on it ... 
So far so good ... the ride is quiet and smooth ... the radio is nice and the 3.4 185hp engine gets about 26mpg on the road .. not bad for a vehicle that weighs over 4,000 lbs ... 
 The heater fan could be more quiet at higher speeds and I wish it had better tires than the Firestone ones on it .. I guess I should have gotten the upgrade ... 
  I'm very pleased so far .. it has the room and utility of a Mini Van but handles like a luxury car ... the 16" tires take the bumps and rough roads around here very well ... and the 11" disc brakes are the best I've ever driven ..
stop on a dime with ease... 
  Compare the Rendezvous to other Suv's and you'll find it is a lot more roomy and has a better ride .. and still gets 
better gas mileage ... 26mpg ... a lot of SUV's that are much smaller get less .. with less power ...

   I also have a 99 Montana that has the same driveline and engine .. I've had it for 3 years and it is as reliable as anything on the road ... no problems with it ...

   I have no problems recommending this vehicle.
