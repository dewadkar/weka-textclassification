            Ok, at first I was really skeptical about the entire digital camera thing - my husband was the one who wanted to buy one. I work for a mortgage company and many appraisers have started using digital cameras, which obviously speeds up the process, but the pictures were awful! I'm looking at appraisals and thinking, oh yeah - those are lovely blue trees, and hey - is the house really magenta? No way am I forking out hundreds of dollars to get pictures like that!

Well, he bought one anyway - the Hewlett Packard C200, and I haven't put it down yet! I can't really compare it to other digital cameras on the market, it is the only one I have used. If you mainly just like to take everyday snapshots, it will serve you well. I love taking pictures all the time of my kids, pets, whatever. However, I've never been very diligent about actually getting film developed. (The last time I actually got film processed, I dropped off about 30 or so rolls of film, dating back over the previous four years, there was even one that was seven years old). Now I have instant pictures and take more than ever!

The pictures from this camera are just as good as the ones from my 35mm. It allows you to select low, medium, or high quality resolution. With these settings the memory card will hold 80, 40, or 17 pictures at a time. I use the medium setting most often. The lower setting pictures are good, but use the medium or high if you want to enlarge your pictures. 

There are a few disadvantages to this camera, although I have remedied most of them. I would first of all recommend getting a card reader for uploading the pictures to your computer. We found one for about $50. If you use the power cord provided with the camera for this purpose, it takes about a minute per picture, and you have to keep the camera on, so the batteries get drained quickly. With the card reader, I just remove the memory card, pop it in the reader and Voila! I have my pictures instantly and no battery usage. Another battery drainer is the LCD screen. Use it very sparingly! When we first got the camera, I had the LCD on all the time - the first time I filled up the card with pictures and put them on my computer the batteries were dead! And that's 4 AA batteries! Fortunately I learned that it was not necessary to keep the LCD screen on all the time. By not using the LCD very much and using the card reader I get 100's of pictures before the batteries go. The only thing you can't change and I'm still getting used to is the delay when you take a picture. It seems to take a few seconds to take the picture, and then you have to wait a few seconds for it to save that picture before you can take the next one. Not good for those &quot;action&quot; shots. I don't like the zoom feature either, you can only use it with the LCD screen on, so I don't really use zoom at all. Also, this camera doesn't come with a carrying case, but I found a good one for about $20 at Best Buy that holds my HP and my 35mm, and has an outside pocket for extra film, batteries, etc.

There are advantages though, this camera is easy to use. I thought a digital camera would be complicated, but it's not any different from the 35mm cameras that I have used. No film to load - just a small card that slides in and out. Instant pictures! (The best part!)The software that comes with it is nice too, I especially like the album feature. You can choose from several different formats to group your photos on one page. It also has a cord that allows you to view your photos on your TV. You can view thumbnails or a full view of each picture in a slideshow type format. I would recommend this camera for anyone that loves to take pictures!<br><br>
