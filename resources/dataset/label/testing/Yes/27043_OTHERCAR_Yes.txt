            If you have hesitated to buy a digital camera, hesitate no longer.  This is the digital camera to buy right now.  It looks and feels like a 35mm zoom camera, but has all the benefits of a digital camera.  Why wait to develop your pictures and then watch them burn a whole in your pocket to get a bunch of red-eyed or blurry pictures.  With the Olympus 450 Zoom you can check at the picture onsite and retake it if it came out poorly.  

This camera has a superb LCD display on the back with a great onscreen menu and easy to press buttons (much better than the lower end model).  If you are not sure where to get it for a low price, check out nationstores.com for $399.99.  When you think about the high price, just think about how much money you have paid for black, blurry and red-eyed pictures.  Go for it, and go with this product.<br><br>
