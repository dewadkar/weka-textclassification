            Best car on the road for the money.  Have owned mine (silver/black non navigation) for 14 months and it still is a dream.  Traded a Maxima for it, and it is superior to the Max in every way.  Bought it because of performance, reliability, low cost of operation, and best resale in its class...better after 4 years than BMW, Lexus, Audi, Infiniti, or Volvo.  Nothing comes close within $5000.

Love the crisp power and wide powerband.  Gobs of torque but smooth acceleration.  Amazingly quick.  No quite as tight handling as a BMW, but at my age comfort in the commute is paramount.  Better than average stereo, but I'm in the electronics business so I've added a sub and a couple of amps.  Great heated leather seats, excellent detail.  Best cupholders out there after the Chevy Silverado.  Never knew I needed heated mirrors, but I do.  Huge trunk, great backseat.  

Nothing to hate, but wish it had 17&quot; wheels, a memory power seat, fog lights, a better location for the secondary 12V jack, and something better than a CD holder for the non-nav dash.

It may cost a bit more than other cars you look at, but if you consider the incredible resale compared to many cars, the cost of ownership may make it more economical.  I want a Type S TL, so if one comes out in 2001 I'm trading.  Otherwise, I'm keeping this one a long time.<br><br>
