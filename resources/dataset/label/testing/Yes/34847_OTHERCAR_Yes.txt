            My friend recently purchased a brand new 200l Honda Odyssey EX   Wow, has she been singing its praises!  I was so pleased when I had the opportunity to take an extensive test drive. And, boy, was it nice! Although I drove the Odyssey, I decided my friend would be the better one to tell you about her car. So I interviewed her!

Q�What made you decide to purchase a mini van?

A�Originally, I was in the market for a sports utility vehicle.  I drove the Ford Explorer, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango. The jeep and the ford could only seat five passengers and what I really needed was a vehicle that could hold 7 passengers; children and adults.  The Dodge Durango offered the space but was too much like a truck for my taste.  I then decided to look at mini vans. Mini vans offered more space, better handling, a smoother ride, and was overall a better match for my needs.

Q�What made you choose to buy the Honda Odyssey?

A�The Honda Odyssey seemed to represent the best value out of the competition, because it offered me exceptional value, quality, reliability, and overall user friendliness.  

Q�What are the most redeeming qualities about your car?

A�.I would have to say that a big selling point was the availability of the navigation system.  I often get lost and I don�t trust that the directions I have received are accurate. I also liked the folding �magic� seats.  This enabled me to get cargo into the back without having to remove the third row seat, unlike other mini-vans.  Another selling feature was Honda�s amazing reliability and its� great resale value.  Among other features, I liked the placement of all the switches and the ride was on par with my Accord Sedan.

Q� What didn�t you like about the Honda Odyssey?

A� One of my least favorite features is the power sliding door.  It is supposed to be a useful feature, but my door seems to have a mind of its own.  When I press the power button to open the door; it will open half-way and then will unexpectedly and quite annoyingly decide to close on me.  The styling of my Odyssey is far from gorgeous and looks really �boxy�.  The stereo system is of marginal quality and for me, feels unacceptable for a car that costs 28,000 dollars.  The engine is beginning to whine at speeds of over 50 mph. The acceleration is adequate however, when I pass people on the road, I would feel safer if it would give me better passing power.  My gas mileage is adequate at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway.  

Q�Your answers prompt me to ask this next question�.given all the negative �issues� you talked about in this interview, I am really wondering why you bought this car?

A�.It may seem like I have given you a lot of negative answers�however, they are really minor considering its many positive features, which I feel have outweighed the Odyssey�s negative features.  I have taken my car back to the dealer and they have since fixed the whine and the door is working at least for now.

Thank you for your time.  Hopefully, this review will positively influence prospective buyers.
