            Just last week I purchased a 1999 Plymouth Breeze that was still under warranty. It had a little over 19,000 miles on it.  I�d been shopping for about a month for a late model used car with a good reputation and better than average Epinions reviews. I also was looking for good gas mileage because I drive about 30-35 thousand miles per year. 

I drove the Honda Civic, Ford Contour, Chevy Malibu, and Chevy Cavalier. I really hadn�t considered a Plymouth Breeze until I saw this one on the used car lot. I liked its looks and the way it was equipped: Power windows and locks, cruise, air, cassette, gauge cluster, etc.

The Civic was too expensive, and seemed small to me. The Chevy Malibu scared me after reading about being plagued by brake rotor problems through the 1999 model year. The Cavalier just seemed like the sub-compact that it is. The Contour was a solid ride, was well-equipped, but seemed downright claustrophobic compared to the Breeze.

Anyway, the decision came down to the Contour vs. the Breeze. I finally opted for the Breeze for a couple of reasons. First, it just feels like a bigger car than it is. I�ve concluded that it really feels big because of the cab-forward design. There is really a lot of space between the dash and the front of the windshield.  I also concluded that the rear seat leg room is huge in the Breeze compared to the Contour. That part is surely no optical illusion.  The second reason was that the Breeze was going to cost me about a thousand dollars less than the Contour, even though the Contour had 32,000 miles on it vs. 19,000 on the Breeze.

Obviously I haven�t had the car long enough to know if I�m going to have any maintenance issues with it, but the reviews are good. I love the way it drives. It corners beautifully with the Michelin Sport tires on it. It�s comfortable and roomy. Trunk space is great and it has a full fold down rear seat if I need more. It just feels right.

I really did my homework on this shopping quest.  If you�d like to know how to not get screwed shopping for a used car, read my recent Epinion on �How to shop for a used car�.
