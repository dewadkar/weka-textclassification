            The 2000 Mazda MPV may well be the best looking van on the street.  It also is one of the smallest on the outside.  But not on the inside.  It rivals my 1998 Olds Van on interior space.  The small outside size adds to great tight handling.  This Van is well priced and the fit and finish were excellent.  It could use a tad more power...but you can't have everything. The fold under third seat is a great design and works very easily.  Overall I like this van and highly recommend it.<br><br>
