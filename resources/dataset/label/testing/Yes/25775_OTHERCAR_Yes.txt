            my mom currently owns a 93 altima gxe automatic and there are many electronics failures.  the fasten seat belt light comes on frequently and is accompanied by a ringing.  this ring is the same one hear when the key is in the ignition and the door is open.  there is also a clicking noise that is heard when the heat is turned on.  we were told that this noise is caused by a cable that runs through the part the opens and closes when the heat is turned on and off.  although these don't affect overall performance of the car it shows that the electronics could be faulty and could be of large concern later since the majority of new cars are run by computers.  don't get me wrong, this car has not given any major problems such as engine problems and is still running very strong.  i also think that it will run for a long time more.<br><br>
