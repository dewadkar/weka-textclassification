            My opinion of the Pontiac Sunfire is that this car handles well and with its 2.4L twin cam engine, the car has some power.  The interior is quite nice and roomy.  Don't get me wrong this car is not a family car by any means.  I drive my mother's 99 Sunfire GT and just love to drive it.  As the famous saying &quot;Driving Excitement&quot; says, this car fits that to a T.  The car drives smooth and turns sharply with ease.  The many features such as the cd player, sunroof and power locks/windows makes this a sure buy.  The some options cost extra but are well worth it.  If you are looking for a car with some power and sporty-looking then this car is one for you.  It will allow you to have a good looking car without the cost.  <br><br>
