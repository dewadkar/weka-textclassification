            I really do love this camera!  This is the first digital camera I have ever owned and if they are all this easy to use  then I am going to love the digital camera age!  I received this camera as a gift this past Christmas and was a little apprehensive about it!  

I was so surprised when I set up the software on my PC.  It set up in just a few minutes.  I was also happy with the ease of use of the manual.  It is clearly written and easy for the first time user to understand.  I was snapping pictures and loading them into my computer in just a few minutes.  

This camera is so easy to use and you really can learn by doing with it.  I take pics and if I like them, I save and if not I delete them and retake the picture right away.  

The pictures are really clear and the resolution is great!  I usually set mine so that I can get 24 pictures on the card.  The pictures are great!  I send them in e mail, use them in my auctions, and also make cards for my family.  There is so much you can do with this little camera.  I am one very happy customer!
