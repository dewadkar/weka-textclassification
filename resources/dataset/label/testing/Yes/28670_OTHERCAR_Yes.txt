            Considering the purchase of a second hand Chrysler Lebaron? It would, of course have to be second hand because the vehicle went the way of the 'dot com company' after the 1995 model year. The Lebaron was subsequently replaced by the more impressively styled Sebring coupe/convertible ensemble. Should we look back at this notable piece of Chrysler history as a viable used car purchase today? 
In a word, yes. 

The Lebaron was an offshoot of Chrysler's controversial, but ultimately lucrative front wheel drive initiative of the late 1970's. A crude but comparatively fun coupe and sedan spawned. Shortly there after, came the convertible. In 1982, the Lebaron convertible was to the buying public what the Viper roadster was in 1994. America hadn't access to a ragtop since the mid seventies, and the car, while simple and rough around the edges, was a raving success. Other convertible manufacturers have tossed their hats into the ring since then, but none have ever reached the level of commercial success enjoyed by the Lebaron. In 1986 came a smooth face-lift. The following year came the completely rebodied Lebaron, which share it's platform with the newly revitalized Dodge Daytona. Instantly a hit, the formula for success was easy to identify. The Lebaron offered allot of bang for the buck, providing levels of content for the dollar that none could match. Also, as Chrysler designed the car to be a convertible from day one, it enjoyed a degree of structural sophistication that no other domestic competitor could match (the Lebaron was built in house, while other manufacturers sent hard top coupes to customizers for conversion). Some Europoean imports could better the Chrysler's integrity, but to do so required far more weight and at up to ten times the cost. After a 1992 face-lift, the Lebaron soldiered on without a dip in sales for three more model years.

So what is the car like to own? On this, I can speak with authority. I am a Lebaron owner by marriage - that is to say that my wife brought the car with her when we married. In high school, she bought a well cared for, low mileage 1982 Lebaron convertible, which with some minor mechanical pains, saw her to the 100k mile mark. Though troublesome, she was hooked. As financial times improved with her age, she decided to buy a new, 1994 Lebaron convertible.
Being practical of heart, my wife chose the middle of the road LX model, wedged between the "rent-a-car" base model and the sporty GTC. It is moderately optioned as well, boasting a cassette player, tachometer, 4-speed, power driver's seat, keyless entry with remote start, and 15 inch wheels. The car was loved and pampered from day one. The Mitsubishi 3-liter V6 was very smooth, the ride gentle, and the broad seats were anthropometrically considerate, being comfortable and supportive on the neck and lower back. The body structure was a god send next to the last Lebaron. It was rigid and quiet in most driving scenarios. Speaking of quiet, with the top up, the Lebaron had one of the lowest interior decibel levels of any convertible in it's price class, and the one above it. The seat fabric was especially attractive and the dash design near ergonomically ideal. Top operation was first class, and you can count on one hand the number of times we have observed leakage of any kind. 

Performance was great at the time as well. The powerful, V6 grabs it's max torque (171 pound feet) at a lowly 2800 rpm's. This is a very usable range, giving the car lots of get up and go for around-town motoring. Hammer the throttle and the four speed kicks down into a flurry of acceleration, seeing 60 miles per hour in a a bit over 9 seconds (good in 1994, acceptable by today's standards). While discussing the transmission, I should mention that the four speed's extra top gear is great for highway cruising, allowing the Lebaron to return 26 miles per gallon on the highway. This car, while well maintained,though, is no summer-only cream puff. My wife loves to drive and pushes her cars well, every single day. The Lebaron has carried us on many fully loaded trips up and down the torque busting hills of Virginia's Blue Ridge mountains. Also, every winter, the little Chrysler flies over rutted snow covered roads with ease when my sports sedan is relegated to the garage. The Lebaron is a safe car as well. Chrysler has installed driver side airbags in it's front drive passenger cars since 89', and passenger side front air bags in most, since 94'. In fact, in 1990, two brand new Lebarons ran into one another on a north eastern country road. One was a GTC convertible, the other a GTC coupe, and both were equipped with driver side air bags. The impact was an offset crash, one that few cars perform well. Both were traveling at approximately 45 miles per hour, making the crash a 90 mile per hour impact. Both drivers (the only persons in each car) walked away with only a few bruises. I know about this because Chrysler was all over this positive press like Oprah on a baked ham, and made a tremendous deal about it. 
 
The bad? Well, the structure is solid, provided you don't subject the Lebaron to any unusual low speed driving situations such as turning up onto a steep driveway. Here, the Chrysler's mid 80's roots begin to show in the form of structural creaking and noticeable body flex. Fit and finish were generally good, though the doors close with a slight rattle and a good slam will cause the side door mirror to wobble. The transmission hunts and pecks for gears in volatile city driving and through twisty back roads. Also, under hard acceleration, torque steer is detectable, and the flurry I mentioned before can feel a little sloppy. A firm hand on the wheel will control this, though. 

Here we are, seven years later, and my wife just rolled the 75 thousand mile mark. How has the Lebaron held up? Well our initial findings have held very true. Recalls were few and far between, not surprising since the car is not new and Chrysler had the previous decade to work out any platform bugs. The car was actually rather trouble free until about the 50k mile mark, where trim around the top began to unravel. We simply restitched bad areas with heavy duty nylon thread -$3. Shortly there after, a bent pulley shaft caused the engine to chirp. Replacing the serpentine, accessory drive  belt and tensioner remedied this problem- $40. About 5k miles later, the cable operation on the rear, drivers side power window assembly bit the dust, leaving the window stuck in the down position. The motor was still good, so we bought a new assembly kit from our local Chrysler Plymouth dealer, complete with wheels, pulleys, and clasps and rebuilt the unit. Upon inspection of the passenger side rear quarter window, we decided it was heading down the same road, so we rebuilt each - $140. Things were then fine, until last spring when the car would periodically choose not to upshift in or out of the first/reverse gear. We lived with this quirkiness for about ten months until the car almost stuck us somewhere. We had the transmission rebuilt at about 72 thousand miles -$1,500. The tech said that the most notable problem with Chrysler four speeds of this era is uses of light weight, cost saving materials in a few key areas - they cannot take the pressure of stop and go driving an give out. Around the start of the year we lowered the top in sub freezing weather (long story), and the rear window subsequently shattered under the pressure. The glass was tempered so our back seat passengers were unharmed. Since the top trim problem had gotten substantially worse, we decided a whole new top was in order, in addition to the rear window -$700. In recent months the Lebaron has been idling roughly. We decided that with 75k quickly approaching, perhaps the fuel filter (not oil filter) was bad. We replaced it($17) but the problem still persists. We are planning to readjust the idle soon, and see what happens.

The reason that I have spoken about all of this maintenance information is two fold. Number one, the sticker price, plus the above stated repair costs still do not even come close to the cost of the BMW 318i. I choose to illustrate this specific car, because my wife also considered it as a viable alternative. And while a seven year old 318 with similar mileage has likely been trouble free, we will never spend what we would have up front for the BMW, on the Chrysler. The second reason I outline all of this is because the problems listed above are very common LeBaron problems. To buy a 75 thousand mile Lebaron with an original top and transmission build, means you will have to consider doing it soon yourself. Most Lebaron convertibles will not see 100k without it, so be apprised. We, however, have crossed the mark with this car. The two crucial weak points of the Lebaron (transmission and canvas top) have, for us, been remedied. I anticipate no other costly repairs as long as we have the car (I have gotten my wife to agree to sell it before it reaches 100k). The structure and top mechanicals will not cause any trouble. The Lebarons are terribly simple, electrically and mechanically, so no trouble there. I have seen the SOHC 3.0 Liter V6 power millions of Chrysler minivans up past 150k miles with no trouble - and that is considering the substantial abuse given to these engines by the unwitting sons and daughters of all these soccer mom owners. The Lebaron takes cheap tires, cheap gas, and off the shelf parts. A little elbow grease on your part and this car will provide a very pleasant, overall owner experience.

Is the Lebaron worth the effort? Anyone who has read any of my Epinions should know that I believe automotive styling to be subjective (for example, some people actually find the Chevrolet Avalanche to be attractive). I feel that the car is elegant looking, and the design choices reflect linear, albeit conservative thinking on the part of Chrysler. Pre 1992 models have more elegant looking conceiled headlamps behind flipper doors, though the tail lamps on post 92 models are cleaner. From 1993 to 1995 you will have but one engine choice, the V6. Before this, the Lebaron was also available with a sluggish but gas concious 2.5 liter four cylinder. Also, you had the option of the moderately quick 2.5 liter Turbo I, rated at 150 horsepower, and the fire breathing 2.2 liter variable nozzel Turbo II with 174 horsepower. This engine was available with the GTC from 1989 to 1993, when the GTC was a notable performance package, not the 'rims and decals' affair it became in the last few model year Lebarons. Also, up until 1994, a 5-speed manual was available, though good luck finding one. With the 2.2 liter GTC, though, 0-60 came in a shade over 7 seconds.

However, we are talking about the 94-95, V6 model, not the early Turbo buzz-bombs. Some would be quick to point out that mechanical head aches, lackluster performance, and a mid-eighties grade body structure are clear reasons for shopping elsewhere. But they're not, though you have to look at it in the right light. Take the BMW 318i once more, for example. The 1994 318 was sporty, solid, and exhibited far better road manners than the Chrysler. If you examine used versions today, expect similar findings. However, to buy a second hand 1994 Lebaron, gets you a V6, 4-speed automatic, dual airbags, power windows, door locks, and seats, 15 inch wheels, heated mirrors, and a power convertible top with heated, glass rear window. To buy a 318, you would be getting a car with fewer power options, a four cylinder engine, and a manual top with plastic rear window in a slower car that has less power, less interior room, more weight, and costs up to $8,000 more. In summary, spend the extra money up front for reliability, or over time in repairs, the choice is yours. We have spent about $2,400 over the hardball figure my wife negotiated back in 94' and are still thousands from BMW territory. Other, more expensive convertibles do, indeed, offer some great features. My wife however, when considering the prospect of having to face her purchase in the garage every morning for the next eight years, chose the stylish, fun, value leader, with questionable reliability, and just brushed up on her mechanical skills.
