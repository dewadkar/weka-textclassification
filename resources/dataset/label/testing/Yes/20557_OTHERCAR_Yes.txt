            Wow a great car! I just got the car about three month ago, and I love it.  It's small.  You can practically fit it into any parking space.  It is fast, when the cops are not around you can go at the maximum speed of 110-120 miles per hour.  It is very chick, people compliment me on my car all the time, they love how it has a very cool sporty and at the same time luxurious look.

My car is black, and it is really hard to keep that way most of the time, with snow, rain and sleet, the car gets really dirty.  However, if you get it waxed at the dealer at least every couple of months, the only thing that you need to do after that to keep it great is to wipe off the dust, and that it's it.
