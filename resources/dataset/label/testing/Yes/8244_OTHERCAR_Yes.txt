            I finally decided to get a digital camera given that we are expecting a new child the next month or so.  My wife called me crazy when she saw how much research I was doing.  I knew nothing about these things, but quickly came up to speed.  I knew I didn't want to spend more than $400 and wanted at least 2MP.  After searching and searching, it came down to the Fuji 2800 and the Canon A40 (I also considered the Fuji 2600 but decided that I liked the other body styles better - plus video with sound was nice - what is the point of video if you can't hear anything).

I bought both cameras and returned the Canon the next day.  The image quality on the 2800 is much better from what I can tell.  I took alot of indoor shots and the A40 pictures came out unfocused while the 2800 shots came out clear.  While the A40 does have TV-out, more manual options, better video quality, the 2800 image quality was what convinced me - after all, what are all the bells and whistles if the basic stuff doesn't even work well.

The EVF/LCD definitely gets dim in any kind of low light (it doesn't have to be very dark - just a little less than normal indoor lighting will cause significant dimming - the A40 was better about this), but I kind of like the EVF, especially since I can see the menu outputs on it and it shows the entire picture.

The 2800 is basically a souped-up entry-level camera.  There aren't many manual controls, but that's fine for my wife and I.  Everything is set so you can just start shooting.  Also, with Windows XP, it recognized the camera as a removeable drive easily and I didn't have to install any software.  Transferring pictures in this manner is just like copy files from a floppy disk.  Very easy.

I can't say much about the included software, but I'm sure it's decent.  The 16MB SmartMedia card that is included is not a bad deal - it can take about 40 normal 2MP pictures and about 20 fine 2MP pictures.  Good for beginning, but I bought a 128MB card.  The included alkaline batteries are also okay, but as most suggest, I bought NiMH from Thomas Distributing.

By the way, I got a great deal (I think) - Microcenter is having a 20% sale on all digital cameras through June 2. So I went to Circuit City (in NH - no sales tax) and price matched (110% price match) to the Microcenter sale. Originally 379.99 - I got it for 294.99. Makes me feel a whole lot better too.  I got the 128MB card from Amazon for $60 and 8 NiMH (1800 mAH) including charger for another $50 or so.  I still have yet to find a good camera case for it since the body is somewhat awkward.  I'm also considering buying a slave flash to help with indoor lighting.  All in all, I came in right around what I had budgeted in all and I am very satisfied.
