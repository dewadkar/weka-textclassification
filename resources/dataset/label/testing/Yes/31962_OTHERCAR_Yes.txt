            Let me tell you about my SUV. It is a silver 2000 Honda Passport. It is stick, has 4 wheel drive, power windows and locks. We paid $16250 for it including tax, title and licensing. It had just under 19k miles on it when we got it. I purchased it in November 02. 

Here is what I like/love about it: 
Price: I thought it was very well priced. Considering it is a Honda and had such low mileage. 

Style: I really love how this SUV looks! 

Size: It isn't gigantic, but it is big enough to carry a lot of cargo. I mostly carry baby stuff, but when that includes a stroller, playpen, bouncer, diaper bag, car seat...it is a lot of stuff. I also get a feeling of security due to the size. I lost my step dad in a car accident; he was in a VW rabbit. 

Comfort: I find the seats to be very comfortable. I am about 5'10" and have no problems reaching the pedals or gear shift easily. The lumbar support is not adjustable, but is very adequate. 

AC/Heat - work great! No complaints here. 

Stereo - can't really comment, I had it replaced since it didn't have a cd player. 

Visibility - I find this to be pretty good. I don't feel like I have major blind spots. 

Cup holders - Well placed so that they are easy to reach. There are 2 of them right behind the shifter. They hold a variety of different size and types of cups. Might be nice to have a couple more. 

Outlets - there are 2 - one for the cigarette lighter and another that I use to charge my cell phone. 

Mileage - I average about 20 miles per gallon. Obviously not as great as a small car, but really not bad considering the size of the SUV. 

4 Wheel Drive - You just have to push a button to switch into and out of 4 wheel drive.  There is a high and low, depending upon your traction needs.  This has been very helpful with the Wisconsin winters.  Just remember that this will help you to get going, but does not help when trying to stop!

And here are the things that could be improved: 
Stability: It feels a bit unstable in tight turns. There is a couple on my way to work and I usually have to slow down more than usual to make it safely. 

Ride: Can be a bit rough depending upon the road. I noticed the difference mostly after I have driven my husband truck,a Ford F150. 

Oil changes: My husband likes to do this himself, but you really cannot get to the filter unless it is on one of those lift things. I guess you have to go through the wheel well to get to it and the tire gets in the way. 

Other things worth mentioning... 
I sometimes wish it was an automatic, but that is usually when I want to use my cell phone. Too hard to shift, steer and hold the phone. This is actually probably a good thing, since I shouldn't be on the phone while driving anyways. 

I have had some problems with the vehicle. Shortly after I got it, I noticed a funny noise when driving at speeds about 60mph. Turned out that it was a defective valve and they replaced the block. This was done at no charge and they gave me a free rental, but it was still annoying. After they did that, there was a problem with the 4 wheel drive engaging, but that was more the mechanics fault than the cars. Most recently, I had the washer tank replaced due to a leak. All of this was covered by the warranty, but still bothersome. 

This may not be the vehicle for you if you have big feet. My husband wears a size 11 - 12 depending on the shoe. He occasionally has problems when braking, where he hits both the brake and gas pedal at the same time. Kind of scary! Needless to say, for this reason he almost never drives my car. Kind of nice since he always moves the seat and mirrors!
