            Why wouldn't you love this car?  Turn the key in the ignition, and take one for a spin.  You'll have a hard time telling whether the engine is running.  Honda keeps getting better and better with their efforts on the Honda Accord.  The fit an finish on the 2000 Accord is usual Honda high standard.  Body panels come together perfectly, controls have a nice solid feel to them.  Honda also as I mentioned earlier has insulated the cabin to the extreme.  Engine noise is non-existent, neither is road noise.  Driving even the base 4 cyl. engine is pleasant.  Most people will find the base 4 cyl. engine to have enough power.  The automatic transmission is silky smooth as well.  Gauges are laid out in a thoughtful manner, as one would expect from Honda. Interior layout is excellent.  The slanted center console is really stylish, and ergonomic. Pop the trunk and wow!  I was surprised as to how much trunk space this car has.  It's huge.  Also a neat idea, is the built in antenna in the rear window.  No more worrying if your antenna is going to snap off in the car wash.

In Canada, I'm not sure in the USA, Honda's extended warranty is a steal of a deal.  It is multi-tiered, so one has many options.  For $600 CDN My father in law got 7 year full coverage on his Accord.  While it is not as great a deal as 4 years ago before the warranty changed, this still represents an incredible value.  

One weak spot with this car is its' &quot;vanilla&quot; styling.  Too bad.  This car unfortunately really isn't all that distinctive from other Japanese sedans.  But that really isn't a horrible thing eh?  

Driving this car is pleasant.  It is well suited to people of all dimensions.  Even the tallest people will not complain of lack of head room.  As well, seats are large, and supportive.  There is plenty of room in this car.  A great family mover!<br><br>
