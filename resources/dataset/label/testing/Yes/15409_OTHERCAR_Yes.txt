            I purchased the Sony MVC-FD83 as a Christmas gift for my parents who live in another state.  There were several reasons I chose this gift.  
1.  My father loves technology and electronic toys
2.  He recently started his own business so he can use the camera to take pictures and update his website
3.  Since my folks live in another state, we can now send pictures and movies via e-mail to stay in touch
4.  Sheer guilt - over my parents spending so much just raising me - and I simply don't visiting them enough

Of course I have been playing with the camera since I purchased it - just to make sure it works properly.  It is extremely easy to use and takes good quality pictures.  A floppy disk goes right into the camera so there's no downloading or connecting to your computer. (Bring along extras disks as only a few photos fit per floppy.) 

The MVC-FD83 allows for still pictures or up to 60 seconds of &quot;movie&quot;.  I've had a lot of fun with it over the past week, but at $700, it's a pretty expensive little toy.

Our company does use this camera throughout the country to show clients/potential clients details of office space.  It also allows us to snap pictures/movies around the country/world for our website or to provide visual data on issues.  It has been a nice enhancement as both a sales and a management tool.

The bottom line:  if you have a business purpose for a digital camera, the MVC-FD83 is a great, easy to use tool that provides high quality images.  If you can't think of a good reason to use this in your business, it's a pretty pricey toy.
