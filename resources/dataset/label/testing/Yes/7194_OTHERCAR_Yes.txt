            I recently parted with my 1996 Nissan Maxima SE but wanted to share my experience. 

Overall :
Performance is great for this car, fuel economy is above average for a V6. It is an inexpensive car for what it offers (Leather, power heated seats, climate control, CD player, power everything on the planet, sunroof, cruise, fog lihhts, mags, etc.) I strongly recommend this car for anyone looking for bang for the buck. Never had a problem with it.

Resale Warning : 
Despite a market value of 16,000-17,000$, dealers did not offer me a penny over 13,000$. I was told that due to a drop in the 2001 Maxima, the resale of all prior models went down. Not too much fun for those of who paid what is worth before ! I finally sold it on a trade for a 1991 4Runner for 14,700$.
