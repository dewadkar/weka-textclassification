              This 1994 Dodge Intrepid ES that I am writing about belonged to a friend. She bought this car two years ago.  It was a silver with leather, key less entry, gas mileage indicator, etc. and had 110,000 miles on it.  She fell in love with the 3.5 24valve V6 when she was able to outrun her friends in a 1999 Mustang V6, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, and other cars.  Her father also loved it and he drove it around 120 mph at 3,500 rpm and it would have gone much faster if there was not a motor stopping device.  Even though she would outrun them in acceleration like this, she was not a lead foot like her father. One night when she was driving home, a manic in an old Lincoln ran a stop sign, traveling around 60mph, and ran into her Intrepid.  She was alright, but her car that had 121,000 miles was destroyed.  She now owns a 1998 Chrysler coupe with a 2.0 straight 4, which she likes a little better, but misses the 3.5.  
  I have heard a million times about people having transmission problems with the Intrepid (most with the 3.5), but the reason why is the transmission fluid and filter needs to be changed at least every 20,000 miles with the exact Chrysler-name brand transmission fluid and filter.  If people would do this the transmission should at least last up to 175,000 miles or more on the Intrepid.  Trust me I know several cases where people did and were satisfied with the life time of the transmission. My friend had this done and her transmission lasted her until the Intrepid was destroyed.
