            Well, all i really have to say is i love this car. I've been driving it for a lil bit over one year now and i've had no problems with it. This car is reliable, powerful, and very very comfortable. Within the period of one year i've driven approximately 30000 miles (because i'm constantly going from L.A. to Berkeley), but the car has showed no signs of problems.  I haven't had any car related with this car, which makes me a happy camper. The power that this car has is also terrific. Even the LX Accords have enough power to satisfy most people's needs. As for the car being comfortable, i sleep in it sometimes!! There is plenty of room in the front and back, plus there is room to store a lot of things inside the car.  One look inside and you'll be amazed at all the room inside.  One thing i can't tell you about from experience, however, is its safety. If you read my review on the camry you'll know that i'm alive because good engineering. I haven't tested out whether or not i'd survive the same accident (and i don't plan on doing so if i can help it), but i'm sure that i would. The accord includes many things to improve its safety according to it's brochure, so i'll just believe them.  I doubt that a respectable car company would lie.  Probably the best part about this car is its price.  UNDER 20K YOU CAN GET A GREAT CAR!!! It's a freakin miracle.

Only thing i can even think about complaining about is so miniscule that it should be ignored. I just wish Honda included an automatic shut off thing for the headlights. The car makes that dinging noise to tell me i'm being stupid, but sometimes im in a rush and forget that the lights are on. Good thing i usually remember when i'm about 10 ft away from the car. Anyway...thats the only thing i can complain about.

Lemme review... It's a reliable, powerful, comfortable, safe, affordable, and a very beautiful car. Everything else is negligible. I suggest you go buy one today.<br><br>
