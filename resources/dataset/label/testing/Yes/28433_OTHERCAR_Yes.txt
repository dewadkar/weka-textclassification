            In June we bought a 2000 Avalon and love it!  It is roomy, comfortable and has all the gadgets to keep us happy.  In trying to decide whether to lease or buy we decided that this car is as good as an Acura or Lexus and would probably never upgrade, so we bought it.

My husband and I bought this car for various reasons.  My hubbie is 6'2 and has trouble with head clearance in most cars, and knee knocking the steering wheels in those with head clearance.  The Avalon solves both of these problems.  I am 5'2 and when the seat is fully up I have a great view of the road.  We have the XLS with the optional package which we got for the seat memory and since hubbie and I are such different sizes, it was worth the $2,000 extra.  

We currently lease a '98 Camry but found that at 6'2 hubbie had to put the seat way down low to have head clearance but then found it uncomfortable to haul himself out of the seat because it was so low.

The car because it is a very smooth ride.  When my husband drives and our 6'1 son sits right behind him, everyone still has plenty of room.  and the trunk is huge - I could not believe how much stuff we were able to get into it on a recent trip. 

Complaints:  The kids complain that they would like to be able to control the AC/heat in the back.  Right now the Avalon has vents in the back (which other cars do not).  Also the cup holders in the front pop out from the seat divider.  If you have 2 large drinks there and have to shift gears, you run into problems.  I also found that if I put my purse on the passenger seat and have coffee in the cup holder, when I pull out my purse to get out, I usually tip over the coffee.  Also, we find the rear defogger does not clear up the window very quickly.
Should these stop you from buying the car - absolutely not!  These are just items Toyota can improve on.

Who should buy this vehicle?  Those who like larger cars, luxury touches.  In our informal on the road survey, you just don't see anyone under 40 driving the Avalon - perhaps because it is so often  compared to the Buick which is definitely not a young person car.  In our research we found that the Avalon was built to compete with Buick.<br><br>
