            2001 Z06 Hardtop Corvette is a power plant of a guys' and girls' car.  This powerful machine is equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission with a 5.7 liter V8 engine producing 385 horsepower.  

Most young teenagers dream about the day when they can own their own vehicles.  They would like it to be a Corvette or the hottest car on the market.  As for my former college buddy, a well-off CEO of a multinational, buying a Corvette to add to his other three luxury vehicles was the right thing to do.  It is quite normal.  For sure, he did not heed the advice of his traditional father who knew hard economic times during the Depression.  To tell you the truth, the old man thinks he is just wasting his easy-earned money.  I will call my buddy Paul for this review to protect his identity. For some reasons, (maybe something he inherits from his show-off college days), he showed up in his Z06 Chevrolet Corvette with his beautiful girlfriend at the high school reunion.

<b>The party was over:  Who is supposed to be at the wheels?</b>
No matter how much money Paul has made over the years, he never stopped taking risks.  That's kind what he lives for.  The riskier the event, the happier he seemed to be.  After observing his girlfriend and him drinking to the point of intoxication, I did not feel right to let them hop into this fast car to return to the hotel.  I asked my wife to follow me in our family car while I would drive his Corvette.  It was the second time I drove a Corvette, but this 2001 one is truly the most powerful car I have ever driven.  I can feel this surge of power as I stepped on the accelerator.  It's very consuming to anybody!  <b>This Corvette is a true guys' car!</b>.  I dropped them off, parked their vehicles and returned his keys to him.  My hope was that they would have a good night sleep.  Would they go straight to bed?

<i>Early morning accident in the Central Valley of California</i>

It was as if this guy was meant to crash his pride, his flashy Corvette.  I later found out that he had left his girlfriend at the hotel and headed out to his favorite local restaurant from his college days here in the Valley.  He only remembered that he was trying to correct the car.  He apparently woke up from his sleep and attempted to overcorrect the car that was in a spinning motion.  By the time, he was fully awake, he ended up resting the car against a canal.  

<b>Reduced Mass Windshield Saved This guy's life</b>

<i>I witnessed the true resilience of this 'Vette: </i>

Paul managed to find his cell phone and called AAA.  They trucked it to the nearest shop.  That's where I went to see the wasted Corvette.  I was shocked to see he survived this crash.  Any way, this is also where I found out all the goodies, the great features of this great car.  I reached down and checked the the mess that became the windshield.  It was broken, but not shattered to cause any injury.  I looked at Paul.  He got out of the accident without a scratch.  Looking at the wrecked vehicle, you would think that its driver would surely die of injuries to the head, chest and...etc.  I took a look at the doors.  <i>A good portion of the frame is made of fiber glass.</i>  It's very sturdy though.  To me, it seems they only glazed these parts with some metallic solutions.  Don't quote me on this because I am not a car manufacturer.  No matter what, I think there is some great merit to this technology and practice!  Is it the wave of the future!  To build cars that can assure our survival in accidents?

<b>Some of the features of the Z06 Hardtop Corvette!</b>

*  Extended Oil Change Interval

*  New Generation ABS Brakes

*  Increase in engine horsepower

<i>Standard features include</i>

*  Safety:  Passenger airbag deactivation switch and side-impact door beams; Head restraint system

*  Theft deterrent system

*  Active Handling Traction Control and Chrome-plated exhaust tips.

*  More standard features you find in most cars are also included!


It's true the price tag will turn off most buyers, but if you can afford this vehicle, it will be a great car to own.  I saw this car in its worst condition, but it still maintained its power and mystique. In the end and this specific case, Paul's affinity for expensive, state-of-the-art technology and safety system may have prolonged his life!  This reality should not be only for the rich.  All cars should be equipped with life-saving technology!  A life is not something to lose and waste just like that after all!
