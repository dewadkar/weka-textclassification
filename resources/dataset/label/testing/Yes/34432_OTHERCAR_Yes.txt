            I bought this 2002 saturn SL1, automatic, air, cd, nothin else 5 days ago.  So this is an inital review.  This particular saturn had 2100 miles on it so it was discounted a little.  My previous car was an 84 lincoln town car, so you can understand my point of view.  I love this car, it rides smoothly, and is quiet (as in road noise & engine noise) except at high speeds.  When the engine is reved high it gets loud, but I like that.  The interior is kind of cheap feeling, but not all of it, but that's to be expected in a low end car.  As far as roominess I am about 5'10" and I find the driver seat quite comfortable.  I have never been in a car that supports my neck properly, my Lincoln, minivans, so i'm happy with the semi-comfortable neck support.  One drawback is the legroom.  It can be quite cramped at times.
       It has great pickup, for me, leaving nothing to be desired, however when the AC is on, the car is quite crippled, but i'm willing to sweat for power :p.
       I would recommend this car definelty.  Mine was 13,300 with 0 percent financing.  I could not afford a new honda with air and CD for that amount of money.

       One thing I was worried about losing from my lincoln was cargo space.  With this car the rear seats fold down and offer plenty of space.  Overall, I love this car and would recommend it highly.
