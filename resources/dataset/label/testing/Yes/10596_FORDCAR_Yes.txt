            Ford is an American institution that most people (Americans as well as foreigners) like to refer to.  You can find very few families who don't tell you proudly that they once owned or still own a Ford.  If you go to Cuba, for example, you can still see the glory days of this company.  When it starts coming out with models such as Ford Ranger that break down more times than you can remember, you start asking questions.  What's going on here.  My experience with a Ford Ranger occurred when I was working for a company that owns one.  I can easily remember some of the calls I received from one of the managers asking me to come pick him up because the Ford Ranger has broken down.  I had to leave everything behind and go retrieve this employee.  For some people, this vehicle has come to mean lack of reliability, a good excuse not to report to work on time or just never show up at all.  It is not every day that there will be available employees to pick up buddies stranded on the road.

To tell you the truth, I hesitated driving this Ford Ranger.  The standard gear was somewhat awkward.  I did not have a fun time driving it back to the office.  Now we can understand why this new policy will be instituted by the beginning of year 2000.  Ford executives must make the grade to get the pay.  The performance is similar to college practice of grading on the curve.  10% of executives will get A's, 80% will get B's and 10% will get C's.  Now if you are an employee and continue to accumulate C's, you may see a few things happening to your check, benefits and job itself.  Customers should applaud this new policy because it will be beneficial to us in the long run.  No more headache with our Ford vehicles due to bad design and other reasons.<br><br>
