            I bought my Monte Carlo LS new in 1997.  It has 70,000 mi. on it today.  All I have done is change oil every 6,000 miles and replaced the serpentine belt at 40,000 mi.  I have not replaced the spark plugs or even put a wrench on the engine for any reason. Of course, I've put tires and brakes on it once.

I am 6'4&quot; and 375# and I have lots and lots of room in this car.  It also rides as well as the last Mercedes I owned.  It is my first American car since 1970.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that it understeers in a high speed turn, so I don't recommend it for Gran Prix racing.  I do like the power from the smallish 3100 cc engine.  It's a lot like the mouse that roars.  It is as good as you can get for travelling.<br><br>
