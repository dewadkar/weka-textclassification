<TEXT>
            We have a chevy malibu. It is only a 98 but it is still running like new. This has been one of the best cars that I have ever drove. It handles extremely well. It is fit for a family of 4 or 5. It is very roomy and luxurious.  The trunk is extremely large too.  It runs so smoothly though. Sometimes you can't even tell it is running.  We used to have a cavalier. It was a nice car but we always had problems with it. With this one the warranty had ran out but it is still running like a charm.  Everyone should be driving one of these.<br><br>
