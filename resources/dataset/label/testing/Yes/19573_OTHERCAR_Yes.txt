            We recently had a second child and found ourselves in a small import with two car seats.  There was only room for us as a family and no one else.  I couldn't bring my niece and nephew (who are frequently with us) anymore.  Prior to having a second child our Toyota Camry was fine.  Both my husband and myself would be in the front and our daughter in her car seat would be in the center of the back seat with my niece and my nephew on either side of her.  With the addition if another little one, the only way that my niece and nephew could go anywhere with us was if one sat on the other's lap. Not a fun thing for anyone.  So we decided on a new car. 

At first we thought that we wanted a van. But looking at all of the mini vans, we saw that they didn't have that much room for 2 adults, 2 pre-teens and 2 little ones in car seats as well as room for strollers and whatever else we needed to haul around with us.  My mother insisted on a Suburban sized car as my whole family has the big SUV types. The parents have a 2000 Yukon XL, the sister has a 99 Suburban and the bro-in-law has a 2001 Navigator.  We were worried about gas but the Suburban seemed to satisfy our needs for space.  So, we looked around and decided on a used '99 Suburban LS.  

It took some time to get used to the size but once we did, we fell in love with it.  It drives like a car but bigger.  The ride is so smooth you can't even tell how fast you're going sometimes.  There is lots of room for everyone.  There is room for both of the car seats in the middle section plus one more passenger.  I like the fact that there is an A/C control for the front and the rear of the car although my older daughter still gets cold from the front A/C as it reaches her. The sound system is great considering it's a stock system.  If necessary, I know that a system can be added to where the front passengers and the rear passengers have separate sound systems and can listen to what they want.  

What I wouldn't mind seeing improvements on are maybe making separate climate controls for the driver and front passenger.  Also, if on the barn doors there wasn't that middle bar section because it hinders your rear view.  I've seen Excursions that have a tailgate type window with the barn doors on the bottom.  Those would work out great.  

All in all this is a great car.  I recommend it for anyone that needs lots of space or just likes to drive big cars.  My husband has never owned or really driven big cars much. He never thought he'd like owning this one but he does! He loves driving it more than I do. The gas mileage isn't that bad.  We do mostly city driving and we don't fill but 3 times a month.  It's a sacrifice that we found well worth it.  We just wish we could get the newer Suburbans. Those look great!
