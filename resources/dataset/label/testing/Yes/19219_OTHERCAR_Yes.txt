            My grandmother bought a 1995 Buick LeSabre new, and despite a few mechanical difficulties, has proven a great car. However, There have been a lot more problems with her 1995 Lesabre, than the 1988 Park Avenue that she traded in. Already, the anti-lock brakes went bad (but were replaced for free under warranty), and the battery had to be replaced. Also, the abundance of foam in the front seats is starting to sag a bit. This car is definitely aging faster than the late 80's Buicks, but the ride is great, and the seats are comfy. The climate control system is fast, and it comes with a power seat, a 3.8 liter V-6 engine, and electric door locks/windows. However, There is no remote trunk opener, so if you want to open your trunk, you have to take your key out of the ignition walk outside and open it manually. What a nuisance! 
     The engine is powerful, and very quiet. Developed in 1987, the GM 3800 V-6 has been known to last over 200,000 miles. It's also quiet and smooth, but fuel efficiency could be better. Expect a combined 20 mpg.
     Overall, this is a decent car and should suit people who want a large car with a fair amount features. Although not quite as luxurious as the Park Avenue, the price is right. 
     If you like the Buick LeSabre, you'll probably like the Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis, and the Oldsmobile 88.<br><br>
