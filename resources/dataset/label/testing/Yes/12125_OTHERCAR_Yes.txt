            I bought my first 626 in 1995. It was a 1993 ES with the V-6 and an overdrive automatic transmission. My girlfriend drove it most of the time since I used it had a second car. When we broke up she took the car and I got the apartment rent free for one year. Believe me she had the best of the bargain. That 626 was a great value, just like the the 2000 model that I purchased in February. This car has just about every feature that I could need in a midsized car. Complete with cruise control, cd player and full power equipment the final cost came to just over $16,000. Mazda had a special rebate plan that reduced the car's price by about $2700.00.It is a pleasure to drive also and good on fuel. Unlike my first 626 the 2000 is a 4 cylinder , less power but better on fuel which makes for a more economical commute.<br><br>
