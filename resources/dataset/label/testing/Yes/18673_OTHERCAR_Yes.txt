            Just took deliver of a 2002 Odyssey LX, w/roof rack, keyless alarm/entry, cargo tray, pinstriping, so-called dealer scotch guard and paint treatment, all for less than MSRP of base LX.  This is our first van and it makes me think why didn't we do this earlier.  This is our sixth (6) Honda, so yes we love Honda products.  My LX has plenty of power at 240 HP.  The rear seats are a dream to sit in and are versatile.  I hope I don't ever need to haul much in my van but if I did, I feel my LX will be up to the task.  You are not going to find a vehicle that meets the needs of all, however, there is no van that is finer than the Odyssey.  The A/C is powerful both front and rear.  The base radio is exceptional; if you want finer radio then I believe you are one the today's kids who want a boom box.  The average FAMILY will be satisfied with the stock cd player or cassette with the stock speakers.  I have heard people say the design is plain....and your point is.  What van isn't?  I happened to love the design of the Odyssey.  The one design change I would make is as follows:  the spare is stored in front of the 2nd row seats and accessible from inside the cab  (This is fine).  The problem is the floor that covers the tire is soft and very flexible as if made of cardboard.  I think this should be made of a more solid piece of material.  I walked from the driver seat to the rear and the floor gave a little bit.  I know this isn't designed to be a real load bearing spot.  I just think a heftier floor is needed here. Thanks.  

15 Mar 02  -  UPDATE:  I have own my Odyssey a few about one month and it has been in the shop four (4) times because of a vibration in the steering wheel while driving 60-75 mph.  I am not Honda bashing because I love Honda.  I own a '00 Accod, '98 Civic, and a '02 Odyssey.  The dealers seem to be trying to resolve my problems but have met with no success.  I have contacted American Honda who appear to be concerned however are quick to tell me they have nothing to do with the tires and I must contact the manufacturer to repalce defective tires.  Honda places Bridgestone tires on the Odyssey.  The dealer has told me two tires are out of round.  I contacted Firestone and they instructed me to contact a local dealer, who told me I had to pay for the warranty check and rebalnce of the tire.  I was also told the warranty only cover defective tires and I would be charged a minimum 10 percent of replacement cost.  Bottom-line:  Tire warranty is a hoax; I will be replacing these sub-standard Bridgestone tire in short order.  I am very disapointed in Honda response to my problems.  I may never buy another Honda simply because they are treating me very poorly.  I am not happy with this purchase.  One would think a new vehicle with 800 miles should be trouble free...not the case with this Odyssey.  I also had a squeak from the front left wheel area while driving 20-35 mph.  Was told brakes had glazed.  Finally, all dash lights lit up as if the engine was stalled but it wasn't!!  I am not happy.  Almost $25k and I have been at the dealership 4 separate days!
