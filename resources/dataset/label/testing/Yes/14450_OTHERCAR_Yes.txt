            A quick story about me and camry's. I used to own a camry until i accidentally drove off a 10 foot hill along the side of Bell Canyon Rd. and hit a tree.  Needless to say, I no longer have the camry, but i do have my life.

If you're looking for a safe family car that will conveniently fit 2-5 people, by all means buy the 4 door Toyota Camry. Although they may not appear to be tanks, they are extremely safe. When talking to other people, i found out that they too have experienced accidents in the car and have emerged unscathed. I owe my life to the engineers who designed the safety features inside of that car.

The camry is not only safe, it is also a very reliable car.  For years i drove w/ minimal need for tuneups. If you want more power, the V6 is a great option. I have a friend who owns a Toyota Camry V6 and he can beat me in a race w/ my new car. The camry is also a very comfortable car. I say this because it is easy to drive for hours without feeling cramped and even in the passenger or back seats, there is plenty of room and comfortable arm rests. The trunk also provides enough room for many grocery bags. I know that in my family it was enough room for a family of four to go on a camping trip. The car also has good mileage, which is important where i live because they charge so much for gas.

Consider everything I said and then ask other people for their opinions as well. Everyone will say that this is a great line of cars and you will be happy when it saves your life.<br><br>
