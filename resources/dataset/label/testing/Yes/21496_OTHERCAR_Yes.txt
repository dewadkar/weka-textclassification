            I must admit, Im a diehard VW fan, my father got the bug and Ive loved VWs ever since. They are quick and sleek cars, the new Golf is no exception.  I got the first 2000 Golf CLS in my city and it was smooth. It handles great, its a 6 cylinder so its quicker than heck and the consoles are nice too.  Downsides: the cup holder sucks, you need to put some effort into getting your cup into that holder, the seats are hard to clean, it also takes some good effort to get all the hairs and stuff off of it. My rear window washer outlet has already broken down and I have to take it in.  If its gets really mucky outside, I won't be able to see a thing from my rear window. :( I also have the airbag light coming on everytime I brake, its scary to think the airbag is going to fly open whenever you stop. The car is going back in this week and Ive only had it for 6 months.  These 2 types of problems should really be happening at all. But overall, the car is superb and is well worth the money, anyone who like quick cars will like the Golf. Although I do see a ton of people driving Golfs all around town. So I guess Im not the only one who likes them. <br><br>
