            This is the perfect family car in my opinion. Versatile with big trunk and interior which can fit comfortably 5 people 6' tall each. Engine is smooth and powerfull enough to pull you through the mountain curves with ease, yet economical enough not to break a bank. Transmission shift seamlessly, unless you are downshifting while going uphill. It is also loaded with features; my is GLX VR6 with all the options, including leather upholstery, sunroof, 6disc CD changer, and heated seats. Sunroof really helps if you are going on high speeds(not above the speed limit of course) and don't want to use A/C or open your windows. Some people like me always get headaches after driving with A/C on for longer than 30 minutes.

If you are going to get it, get Wolfsburg edition as it is made in Germany and quality is impeccable. I have driven Honda Accord before and after Passat, it feels like a Yugo with a little more zip. As soon as you get inside the Passat, you don't want to get out. The gauges and controls placed perfect ergonomically. The whole interior creates cozy feel. 

The only flaw I found so far is lack of glove compartment, but it is available online as an aftermarket part($99 plus s/h). 

Engine is very strong; if you change your oil frequently (I prefer to do it yourself, and add only synthetic oil) and do the necessary tune up it should last you 200 000 miles easily. I have '91 Passat Wagon with 4 cylinder engine with 125 000 miles on it still running with no problem at all.

Overall I would recommend this car to anybody(unless you are my enemy of course, then get a Camry or Accord).
