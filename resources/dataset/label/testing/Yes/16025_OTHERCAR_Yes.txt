            I love my '93 Camry LE (4-cylinder.) It is the smoothest, most reliable car I have ever driven besides my dad's BMW, which I certainly can't afford. My Camry has more than 93,000 miles on it and I have never had a major problem with it. The car makes me feel safe. It's big and heavy yet has a sporty, peppy acceleration.  One time a pickup smashed into the back of my car in rainy weather and my Camry protected me -- I never got a scratch! It's a nice-looking sedan with a sleek, black exterior. It's comfortable, too, with big, leather bucket seats; a roomy back seat, lots of leg space and a huge trunk! I had planned on keeping this car until it ran into the ground, but now I am wondering if that will ever happen. I'll probably have it well into the new millennium. I bought my Camry used in 1996 for $11,500 and it's been one of the greatest bargains I've ever purchased. It's fun to drive along Texas' wide-open highways and not bad on traffic-filled ones, either. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a safe, reliable, comfortable and attractive car. However, I'd recommend a light color rather than a dark one, especially in hot climates. That black exterior certainly heats up the interior in Austin's 100-degree summers! <br><br>
