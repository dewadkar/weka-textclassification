            I had been hanging around for over a month on the net reading reviews about which was the best digital camera to buy. Obviously i wanted a 2.1 megapixel digital camera and price was also a constraint for me. I had been considering the Canon powershot A20 & Olympus D510 Zoom for quite a while. The D510 zoom had better features (larger LCD,more zoom etc) but the price(400$) was going against it. Then i also had to consider the additional cost memory($50 more), Rechargeables($50 more) etc.
        
I have read a lot of reviews online and everyone was very appreciative of the olympus camera. But be wary of the online stores which appear to give them at rock bottom prices but heavy shipping...or u won't get the product at all!
luckily for me, "Circuit City" had a discount offer on the Olympus( I got it for 300$ !!!!! ) and I went in for the kill. And as if this was not enough, olympus had an offer for free additional 64 Mb memory for purchases till jan 31 2002. And all in all I got a great deal of 150$ on the best digital camera. 

Well, now that i have finally managed to buy it. I have had it for about 1 month now. 
Let me tell you my experiences with it:

1)The pictures , especially the ones taken during the day were extremely clear. Night shots are also good enough i guess. The night scene mode gives good pictures. The cam has a decent 3X zoom(equivalent 35-105 mm) which is quite good in its category.

2) But night pictures..like that of fireworks(taken at light sensitivity of ISO400(max for the cam)) etc are not very clear...but good enough i guess. I had taken the shots of the olympics closing ceremony fireworks. After seeing them live may be i am expecting too much from the camera.

3) I got my 64MB card today by mail after 1 month. The default resolution is 1600X1200 which is kinda large i guess. I generally don't take prints . I only upload them . so probably a screen size of 1024X768 should be enough for me. But there is an ambiguity at this resolution:

For my 64Mb card:
at 1600x1200(HQ) ---- 128 pictures
at 1024x768(SQ)  ---- 107 pics !!! isnt it crazy

4) The manual should be more descriptive. The camera doesn't turn on unless u slide out the lens cover and hear it click for a SECOND TIME. And i had to return my first piece thinking it was faulty!
Also many features are properly documented in a 160 page manual on the software CD.

5) The Alkaline AA batteries included in the package lasted only some 30 or so shots. I had been experimenting with the various settings and the LCD so that was not a bad battery life i guess. I bought a Wall charger (23 $ with 4 AA NIMH batteries) and a Car charger(24$ with 4 AA NIMH batteries) at Radio shack......this charges them in about 13 hours. I couldn't spend more on a faster charger as i had a budget limitation.  These NimH batteries were excellent.Battery life is superb. I have taken about 150 pictures with the 4 rechargeable batteries(NiMH) using flash 75% of the time.
