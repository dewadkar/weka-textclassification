            Ah where to start.  Ever since I was a kid, I always lusted after a Corvette.  An amalgam of the mystique, the righteous power, and beauty in form always put me in a trance.  In March of 2001 I found a 1997 C5 available with 21K miles in immaculate condition.  This black on black 6-speed was to be the realization of a dream.

For the most part,  it has met and exceeded my expections.  I've upgraded the wheels from the 1997-1999 type with the factory style from 2000 and on.  I installed a KN filtercharger kit and B&M short throw shifter.   I do lament the lack of heads up display and active handling options available in C5's in the years to come.  Other than that and a tilt-telescoping steering wheel option, not much substantive has changed during the C5's model run.

Pros....

This car rides like a sports car and it doesn't have any of the horrible squeaks and rattles of previous 'Vettes.  The "hydroformed" steel frame rails were a GM innovation first introduced on 1997 Corvettes and the structural rigidity is a strong point.   Torque is what the Corvette and muscle cars are about and this car answers the call with 350 ft-lbs at very low rpms.  There's something so satifying about getting power on demand without hearing a supercharger whining or a turbocharger spooling up.   A nice heavy push in the small of your back.  The real time adjustable damping F45 suspension option is a nice one.  Never as bone jarring and tight as the sport Z51 suspension the differences between Tour, Sport and Performance modes are obvious.  It's nice to be able to cruise with the touring set-up knowing you can always shift to firmer settings when wanted.  Zero to 60 comes in about 4.7-4.9 seconds.  Nuff said where that's concerned.  This is a seriously fast car that can top out at 171 mph.  At 145 mph with the top off, the car felt solid and ready to give me more.  I don't recommend this to anyone.  The Bose stereo also provides excellent volume and clarity.  The sport seats provide excellent lateral grip with almost unlimited settings.  I am also very impressed with the variable assist steering which always feels so nicely balanced.  One surprising plus has been the gas mileage.  When the C5 Corvette was introduced it had the lowest coefficient of drag for a production car.  Also contributing to the excellent gas mileage is that fact that 5th and 6th gears are overdriven.  I average nearly 30 miles/gallon in highway cruising and about 20-24 in most combined driving.  Who says you can't have it all?  Another pro of this car is the amount of cargo the coupe can hold.  I've always been a believer in hatchbacks and this car confirms this belief.  I can't understand why Saab has gone away from them.  Eliminating the need for a spare tire with the runflat tires has opened up a cavernous hatch area.  The most obvious pro is the appearance/styling and image this car carries.  Corvette is an American icon and driving one is more than just about horsepower and skid pad numbers.  I feel the mystique everytime I sit in my car.  I love waving at other Corvette owners; continuing the "Corvette wave" tradition.  In my opinion, there are few pleasures more visceral and pure than driving your 'Vette with the targa top off listening to your favorite tune loud with an open road ahead.   Try that Bill Ford.

Cons...

Well as the previous owner of a 1999 Audi A4 quattro, I can honestly say that Chevrolet could learn a few things about interior materials and interior fit and finish.  There is black plastic everywhere.  The dash set up is excellent and the gauge package looks beautiful, but the execution of the rest of the interior is lacking and makes you wonder if you not sitting in a Cavalier Z24.  The stock Goodyear Runflat tires are also a  disappointment.  I can understand that the stiff sidewalls cause increased road noise.  I can also understand that for packaging not having a spare tire gives increase cargo space and saves weight.  What I cannot understand is why the tires on a premium automobile have to create so much roar within the cabin, especially on certain kinds of concrete.  It can become tiresome on long trips especially with the windows up.  I've notice this gets exponentially worse as each $300 tire wears.  Other quibbles are the ineffective parking brake, speaker housings that rattle to the beat with bass heavy music and leather on the seats that seems half as thick as it should be.  Many Corvette owners have complained about the durability of the leather on seating surfaces.  Other known problems with this model are loud fuel pumps and rotors that warp with light use.  These are minor points, but ones that might make a difference if one were to make this their only car.
