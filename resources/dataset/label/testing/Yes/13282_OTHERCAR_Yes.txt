                  The Honda Accord is an overall nice car. It has the stylings of a $50,000 car at a much lower price. The EX Accord has such options as leather, CD player, moon-roof, and a large trunk space. The LX Accord, at about $2,000 less, comes with cloth seats, no moon-roof, a cassette player, but all the other features of the EX. Personally, I think that $2,000 isn't a lot of money to spend for all the convieniences that the EX has to offer. The EX Accord drives well, and has good handling. Never do I feel that I am on the verge of losing control, even in icy or wet conditions. It has dual airbags, which is important for the safety of me and my family. It has anti-lock brakes and power-steering. In addition to these characteristics, the EX Accord has the option of a six-cylinder engine, as opposed to the LX's four-cylinder engine. The EX, therefore, packs a little more power, which can come in handy when you find yourself in a rough situation. Both models have all-wheel drive, which can be a life-saver if you live in the Northern areas of the country, and have to deal with ice on a regular basis. I have nothing but good things to say about the Honda EX Accord. The LX Accord is also a great value, but I truly believe that the EX model gives you more for the money. I would suggest this car to almost anyone, especially someone who wants the qualities of an expensive car, without having to dish out a lot of money. <br><br>
