            My car has 58,000 miles on it and it runs like a dream.  The 2.6L engine has plenty of zip and the MB suspension makes you feel like you're ready for LeMans.  My cars retail value was $35,950 and it is worth $16,900 today, what a great investment for luxury driving in an extremely safe vehicle. I'm thinking about selling it, but only to the right buyer... I'll be very selective.  It's so pretty with the metallic pewter two tone paint and the beige leather interior. If you must make amends...get a Mercedes-Benz!  This car can be driven for another 150,000 miles with total confidence, after all, it's Mercedes-Benz engineering.  The thing that surprised me was the &quot;big car&quot; feel in the suspension.  It's so darn solid and quite.  This is definitely the Ultimate Sports Sedan!<br><br>
