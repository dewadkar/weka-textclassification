            I saw the Z8 at the Car Show and had to own one! Oh, those lines! It has to be the most beautiful car ever designed.

I have owned the car for 7 months now being very careful not use it if it might get dirty (I know, I'm still in love) and I never return back to the house without at least one conversation with a total stranger that's been prompted by the car. 
Everyone loves the car!
A consistent comment is often along the lines of "classic style" - "not too 'aggressive looking' like a Ferrari or Porche"

Performance is of course amazing (as you would expect at this price point) but the car is still a pleasure drive around town. It can be very restrained when needed.

The centre instrument panel took a few trips to get used but I now prefer it. When I drive other cars, the view ahead seems cluttered to me now. 

Don't expect the obvious computer wizardry you find in other cars. The user controls are very basic by modern standards with application of technology being very well restrained. I prefer this and it fits the image of the car. Another benefit is that the user manual becomes an enjoyable read rather than "required reading" before you can drive the car home!

We also have a SL500. As a comparison the SL500 is a very quick, refined drive and not a hair on your head moves out of place. The Z8 drive would be fast, exciting and you would look as if you had been on a roller coaster! Take a comb with you if you worry about that stuff! Oh, and you would be beaming from ear to ear too.

The balance between power and road handling is excellent -bends seem to just mold into the scenery.

Two small gripes.
On a car this expensive I would expect provision for 2 coffee cup holders so that the passenger can have drink too. BMW designers seem to think that this car will spend it's entire life at breakneck speed when often it's in a traffic jam going to the office. (Real people buy these cars!) 
Secondly, the audio system is atrocious! It befits a car only 10th the price of this. It needs looking at!

We have been lucky enough to have owed many nice cars over the years (currently the SL500, Jaguar XK-E, BMW X5 & Z8). Previously, Porche 911 & 928, Bentley TurboR. 

This is my favorite.
