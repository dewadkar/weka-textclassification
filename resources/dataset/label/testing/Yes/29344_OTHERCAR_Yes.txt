            My husband and I love <b>Hondas</b>.  I owned a Civic CX when I was single and loved the way it handled.  I never had any problems with it either and I guess you could say that is why I tend to only lean towards <b>Honda</b>.  When my hubby and I got married we moved to Toronto and decided to buy a larger car and sell my Civic since it was a hatch.  What did we choose?  A Honda Accord Coupe..what a great car!!  I loved it and wanted to keep it forever.

Eventually we moved to Alberta and had to buy a second vehicle.  What did we choose?  You guessed correctly...another Honda!  We decided on a Civic Sedan as we knew that someday soon we would start a family.  The Civic was my car...and the sportier one..his!!

Then, about 6 months after that, we found out that we were going to have a baby.  We decided at that point that we needed to sell the Accord as it was a two door and we wanted all of our vehicles to have four doors.  It was a sad day seeing that car go, but knew we needed to do it.  It was at that point that we decided to go with a Sport Utility.  

We looked at many different models...Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, Dodge Durago...all <b>GAS PIGS</b>! We knew other people that had purchased these trucks in the past and ALL of them complained about how expensive they were to drive.  We decided that we would look at the CRV as an option. 

<b>What Do We Love About The Honda CRV?</b>

1. All Wheel Drive - Does not matter what your roads condition are, the CRV will adapt to them.  I feel VERY confident driving on ice in the winter time.

2. Roomy - This sport utility is wonderful for room.  There is plenty and most are suprised when they sit in the back seat. There is plenty of room in the hatch as well.

3. Tire is on the back of the car - The spare is located on the outside of the car so that there is room for storage.

4. NOT A GAS PIG - Need I go on?

5. Drives like a car - I love the fact that it does not feel like I am driving a heavy truck!

Since we purchased this sport utility we have not been happier!!  We know some day we will trade it in for a newer one, or may decide on a van depending on how large our family gets some day.  What will we choose?  An Honda, of course!!
