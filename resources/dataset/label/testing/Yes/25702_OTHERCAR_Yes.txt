            My experience with the Nissan Pathfinder when we owned one was a relatively good one.  With just a few dislikes, I thought it was a good vehicle to have.

The steering on this had a little bit of play in it, but nothing major.  It was maybe 3/4 of an inch before the vehicle responded, but that isn't anything that would be too tough to handle.  Other than that, the steering was tight, so you didn't have an oversteering problem that often, if any at all.

The main thing I didn't like was the feel of the brakes.  They responded as soon as the pedal was touched, not having a little play before they go into effect.  Most people would say to have them adjusted, but I'm not ignorant, that didn't help.  When you pressed the breaks, they would instantly work and the vehicle would have a slight jump forward, which made the ride jumpy on occasion.

The power of the engine was fairly decent.  I thought it had a good acceleration rate for the size of the vehicle, so no problems there.  Yet, the gas mileage didn't do quite as well.  Ours got about 21 miles to the gallon.  For some that would be good, others it wouldn't.  It all depends on your preference.<br><br>
