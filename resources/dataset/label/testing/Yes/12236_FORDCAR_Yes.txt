            Bought the Ford Ranger because I thought it would be a good light duty truck with good gas mileage.  Overall I've been pretty happy.  I have the 4-cylinder model and it's only 2 wheel drive.  When I bought it used from my brother, I figured that with the small body it would still have enough power, but unfortunately it is lacking a bit in the power category.  Don't get me wrong, you are still able to haul quite a bit of stuff in the back, but as far as getting around in mud or snow, or trying to push or pull things - going to have to get a bigger truck.  
I have gotten stuck a few times in mud, and on snow. On wet pavement or snow your rear end slides around an awful lot.  Sand bags in the back help, but then you get back to only having the 4-cylinder and you watch your gas mileage drop considerably.  The other deficiency in power comes in when you're on the interstate and have any sort of a headwind coming at you.  I frequently have to downshift to maintain speeds while going up even small hills.  
As far as comfort goes, the Ranger is O.K.  The cab is small, and I don't like to travel long distances in it because you only have just so far to move the seat even if you are only an average size man.  I'm 5' 11''   and go about 200 lbs.  The other thing that makes it difficult is that I have the manual transmission - and on long trips it stinks to not have cruise...
During the summer and when I'm not hauling things the gas mileage I get with it is great.  I can usually go 300-400 miles on a tank of gas(about 15-16 gallons), depending on where I'm driving.  The interior is very nice, and easy to keep clean.  The truck warms up relatively quickly, within 4-5 minutes.  The bed is small but definitely sufficient to haul loads from one place to another over short distances.
When it comes to maintenance though is where the Ranger wins the prize over any other vehicle I have ever owned.  Other than annual maintenance, I have never had ANY problems.  My wife has gone through two vehicles and is on her third because of difficulties with mechanical and other problems.  I on the other hand have the old reliable.  I never wonder if my truck is going to start, or if I can trust it.  I have been proven to time and time again that the truck has been put together with quality parts and by qualified people.  Six years, zero problems, kinda hard to argue with stats like that.
So, in summary, in my opinion, buy the 6-cylinder, with the four wheel drive, and the automatic for the cruise if your are going to take it on distance trips.  Don't expect it to have a lot of power, or accommodate a 250 + pound man in the comfort category, or handle really great on ice or wet pavement.  But do plan on dependability and gas mileage.
Who should buy this - dads sending your daughter (or son)off to college, dependable and efficient with space to haul things,  Women who want a truck, but not a huge monster, and anyone who wants quality.  
My next truck will definitely be a Ford...just one that's a bit bigger.<br><br>
