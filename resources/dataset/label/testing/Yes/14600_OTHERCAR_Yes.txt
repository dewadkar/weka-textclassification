            My family bought this car when i was in grade 1- and it's still going strong! I'm about to inherit it, as i will be getting my license shortly- i can't wait! AC/heating, power windows, power locks, lights EVERYWHERE cool little compartments to store change and stuff in, etc...and big seats so all my friends and i will get around safely! we never really had any problems with our car until the last year or so (that would be 9 years of problem-free!) and they were only minor problems that were fixed easily (minus two times of brake trouble and some dead batteries) I highly recommend the Honda Accord for new families who want to keep their kids safe- it worked for me!! I've never been harmed while in that car! (well once i shut the door on my finger!) You will want to get a new paint job every couple of years though, the other day i noticed two tiny rust spots! Good luck and drive safely!<br><br>
