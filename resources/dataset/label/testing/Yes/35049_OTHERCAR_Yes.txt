            The British Land Rover Discovery has been replaced by the 1999 Land Rover Discovery II, which is about 85 percent new and is far superior to its predecessor. How many bought the original Land Rover Discovery SUV largely because of its high snob appeal? It looked odd and reliability wasn't very good. It also handled poorly on pavement. This sport-ute even looked prone to tipping. That costly Discovery, which debuted for 1994, also wasn't very fast because its rather small 4-liter V-8--based on a 1960s Buick V-8... didn't have enough punch to propel the heavy vehicle with aplomb. The solidly built Discovery II has a last-forever feel. But will an owner want to keep this vehicle a long time after driving more modern competitors such as the RX 300 or Jeep Grand Cherokee?
