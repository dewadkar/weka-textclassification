                   I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. After reading my reviews, read some on other aspects of the car you're looking for from the experts here at epinions, and make your choice. 

<b>THE GOOD:</b>  

    The Saab line of vehicles has been around for a good long time. I have seen quite a few of them from underneath with <b>over a quarter of a million miles on them</b>, and they hold up very well. The suspensions on these Swedish vehicles, though nothing to brag about, are constructed very well. They are simply an SLA front suspension,(meaning upper and lower control arms) <i>on the 99 and 900 models</i>, with coil springs and rack and pinion steering. With the damping done with a simple shock absorber. The rear suspension is a straight axle, with again, coil springs and simple shock absorbers. The front suspension on the 9000 models is a standard MacPhearson strut configuration.

     You aren't going to find on most models any four wheel independent suspensions nor any fancy arrangement of high tech steering linkage or suspension components. What you will see, though, is a near bulletproof simple design. Well laid out and built with very high quality metal throughout. And requires little or no maintenance, while lasting a good long time. This goes for almost all of the Saab models, as they are almost all designed with the same front end configuration. 

      I have seldom seen any need in these for low mileage front end re-builds as a result of poor quality, as the steering and suspension components have obviously been constructed with some of the best designed metals in the industry. These cars seem to want to go on forever. Neither the ball joints, nor the outer tie rod ends are factory greasable, attesting to the fact of high quality OEM parts. Oh I have replaced a few outer tie rod ends on these, and the occasional set of shock bushings, but this seems like the exception rather than the rule.
 
     There is a real love for the Saab vehicles in the area where I live, and I have had ample opportunities to do alignments on these vehicles. I would highly recommend that if you are looking at a possible purchase of a used Saab, not to worry at all about the steering and suspensions, they will go the extra mile for you.

<b>THE NOT-SO-GOOD:</b>

    
   The only drawback I have found with the rear suspension is the fact that you can not align the rear end should something unfortunate happen. Most of them have the spindle stubs welded onto the straight axle, not bolted on like many other vehicles. The only way to bring things back is to replace the axle, or bend it with some kind of porta-power, or more primitive means, which doesn't exactly appeal to me in the least.

   One thing I have found on Saab's though. If you upsize the tires on these vehicles, and I have come across a few which have, they handle very erratically on snow and ice. I, for the life of me don't know why, but they do. My boss had a Saab 9000 and put one size bigger tires on it, and it swayed all over the road. After I aligned it perfectly, it was still the same. Then we changed the tires to the size it came with, and it went perfectly straight. No reasonable explanation can be found, so when you do purchase that new or used Saab, stick with the tire size it came with.


   Weigh out all the other aspects of a Saab against everything else you are looking at, check the front ends of those against the long lasting and near maintenance free Saab models, and decide for yourself. You won't find many more cars like the Saab in longevity front end wise.
