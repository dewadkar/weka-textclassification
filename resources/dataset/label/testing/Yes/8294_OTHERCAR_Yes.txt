            My Corolla LE has lived up to all the reviews. Arrived without any defects that I can see. Gets about 30 mpg on my mixed (largely highway) driving. 

As a driving machine, the car has impressed me. Comfortable acceleration and reasonably smooth automatic shifting (I would have preferred manual, but it didn't come with ABS in this region). Steady, predictable steering. Handles wind, slush, and icy snow like a tank. I had to drive over some local mountains in the midst of a snowstorm, and never missed 4 wheel drive. Braking with ABS was extremely secure. However, the part of me that enjoys a sporty feel to the handling sometimes complains. I used to have a small Saturn, which felt much sportier though it was also much less secure in adverse conditions.

Has more amenities than any other car I've owned in this class: safety (ABS, side airbags), entertainment (passably good radio, excellent sound on CD and cassette with 6 speakers), and comfort (somewhat overaggressive upgraded heater that can be challenging to keep at comfortable levels, as well as effective A/C). Fit and finish seem perfect, and the driver's seat is comfortable for me, with plenty of thigh and lumbar support. Steering wheel was slippery, but a $15 wheel cover from Pep Boys solved that. Controls are easy and intuitive, from those on the stalks around the steering wheel to the ones on the sound system and climate control. The gauges are extremely visible. I was in for a shock regarding how fast the gas warning light went on, after a sudden drop from 1/4 of a tank. The other thing that perplexes me is the "smart" headlight and interior gauge lighting system. It figures everything out for you, based on the surrounding light. But it sometimes takes a bit long for the interior gauge lights to come on. (Of course, this can be remedied by handling it manually, as I have done on every other car I have owned.) With automatic locks and windows, and everything working like a charm, this is turning out to be a perfect commuter car. 

My buying experience with Carsdirect resulted in a good price and absolutely no dealer hassles, plus exactly the model and color I wanted (given that only certain configurations came with ABS). 

This is a strong recommendation coming from quite a picky and experienced driver!
