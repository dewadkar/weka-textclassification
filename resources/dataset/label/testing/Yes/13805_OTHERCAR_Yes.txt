            The new Mercedes Benz S430 year 2000 is a remarkable work of art.  Its redesigned body looks much sleeker and better than the previous models.  I bought this car in February of 2000.  I have been very happy with it so far.  There have not been any problems that I have experienced so far, but I've only had it for a few weeks.  The S430 and S500 only have minor differences, such as the Xenon lights and of course the bigger engine.  The body style and equipment are all the same.  There's a $10,000 difference between the two models.  The car is very smooth with its new air suspension.  You can even raise the height of the car by pressing a button on the dash board.  The GPS system is very helpful when going to new places.  I have learned to master it within a few days even though critics say its very complicated.  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to operate the system.  There is plenty of leg room in the rear, enough for even a long ride.  The new smart key is very useful.  Its easier than finding the right key to start the car, all you do is plug the remote in the ignition and turn.  The lights even stay on for you as you lock the car so you can find your way.  You can program your key so that it sets your seat, mirrors, steering wheel height and radio station.  There is too many options to list on here so just go check it out.  The price was pretty firm , close to MSRP so don't plan on negotiating too much.  It runs from the low 70's to the mid 90's with options.  <br><br>
