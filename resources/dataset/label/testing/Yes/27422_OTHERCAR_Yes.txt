            I was looking for a small sporty economical vehicle. The car drives very well and I am very happy with the performance.  Even after 75,000 hard miles it still drives very well.  I am disappointed in the economy of the car.  It does get excellent gas mileage but the cost of repairs is excessive.  The clutch went out at 37,000 miles right after the warranty expired.  Of coarse it cost $600 instead of $250-300 because the weak standard parts  needed to be replaced with a factory upgrade.  The factory wouldn't stand behind it and instead charged $200+ for this part.  Then both front bearings went out at 40,000 miles. This wasn't covered either.  Instead of being able to go to a CV axle repair shop for $90 an axle, this also cost $600 for both because the parts were not available at wholesale to the repair shop.  These two things alone, cost me 10% of the value of the car before I even hit 50,000 miles.  One other major fault is the fact that the window whistle VERY loudy and the dealer couldn't do anything about it (this was addressed in the newest model).  The is a good car for people who want a sporty performance low cost vehicle.  People who are looking for lowest dollar per mile economy vehicle should stay away from it due to high maintenace costs since parts are high priced from Dodge and many after market parts aren't available.<br><br>
