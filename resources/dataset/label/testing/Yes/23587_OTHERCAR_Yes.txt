            My girlfriend and I walked into our friendly neighborhood Lexus Dealer last week (Beverly Hills, CA).  After snooping around the showroom at a couple of Black IS300's we were approached by &quot;Jake&quot;  a salesmen wearing a White Lab Coat!  

&quot;Hi, welcome to Lexus, can I get you a Cappucino or Mocha?&quot;  

WHAT?  Am I at a car dealership or a Starbucks?

&quot;I would love a Mocha&quot; my girlfriend says, (before I can play tough guy shopping for car I don't really want)...  &quot;and he would like an Espresso&quot; she adds.  Frustrated at her blowing my attitude, I say &quot;yes, that would be fine, thank you.&quot;  

Jake hurries off to the all inclusive lexus-branded cappuccino machine located in the finance department and returns with our drinks.  In the meantime I read the IS300 uses the 215 HP motor and notice that it comes stock with CLEAR taillights and 17&quot; wheels.

Jake returns with the drinks and asks if I have had the opportunity to drive the new &quot;I-S?&quot;  I say no, but state that I would be interested in a test-drive.  He says, &quot;that would be great, we will get to know each other while driving.&quot;  I can't believe how nice this guy is.  No pressure, he genuinely cares about whether or not we enjoy our drinks while asking a porter to bring a car around.

The test-drive of the day is a Charcoal Grey IS with a black Escaine Leather interior.  It is attractive, but I immediately notice the silver ball gear shift level indicating that this car is an automatic.  I tell Jake that I only drive stick-shift.  He laughs saying that the IS is only available in an automatic, stating that I should drive it anyway.

Well, long story short. I didn't miss the clutch.  This car is fast, nimble, quiet and solid.  If you are considering the more expensive 330 BMW or S4 Audi go for it, but if you want a 35K or less out the door car, This is it hands down!

The stereo system is in my opinion worth an extra 5 grand, second to none in a stock system.  All primary and secondary controls in the right places.  Comfortable, sporty, and attractive car in all.

A little less refined than some Lexi I have driven, but a real strong athlete at this price point.

Before buying anything within 10 grand plus or minus 35 grand - one should definatetly drive this car, and if you happen to be in the LA area, ask for Jake at Bev Hills Lexus.
