            I received this camera as a gift after my girlfriend spent long hours researching web sites.  It didn't take very long at all before I was running around taking pictures.  The directions were fairly clear and easy to begin the basics of using the camera.  After a few months, I may be using half of the available features.

You can vary the quality of the image and thus change the capacity of the SmartMedia card based on how you will use the photo.  The camera comes with a remote which is great for taking group photos when you don't want to ask someone to step out to take the picture.  The zoom lens is fair, and you can increase the zoom by using the digital zoom feature.  When you do this, you don't want to use the viewfinder because the digital interpolation will alter the center point of the photo, instead use the LCD screen.

One popular complaint is that the lens cap is not attached, I can't believe I still have mine, but I'm always paranoid whenever I take it off.  Also, this camera used the serial port.  Though it is slow, my greatest complaint is that you never know if the serial port will work on a given PC.  I had to free up an IRQ to be able to use it on mine, and if you bring it over someone else's place, they may have the mouse in the serial port.  It can be a pain in the neck. They do have an adapter for a floppy drive.  You put your SmartMedia card in the adapter, then place the adapter into a floppy drive.  Very cool, goes for an additional $80 or so.  There is also a composite video cable so you can connect the camera to a TV and view stills.  Great for when you bring your camera to a party and you want to view the pics right away without a PC.

I am a little concerned with the durability of the camera, it would be nice if it had a rubber shell around it.  For this price, the camera should come with a case.  I bought one for about $25 and you can barely fit the camera in it.

Overall, I like this camera a lot because of the quality of the photos, and the features.  If quality is your #1, then definitely look at this camera.  If convenience is more important and your not comfortable hooking cables up to your PC, either get the floppy adapter or look at a Sony Mavica which uses floppy disks.  I thought about that but then I'd be carrying a stack of floppies around with me.

-No thanks

In general, I would highly recommend a digital camera of any brand.  The opportunities are amazing.  We bought a house a few months ago and this was awesome to bring along while touring with realtors.  We could go home at the end of a day and review all the photos right away and compare house without having to ask, &quot;Which was the 'great commuter location' house 50 feet from the interstate?&quot;<br><br>
