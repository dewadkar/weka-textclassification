            My husband and I went looking for a &quot;family&quot; vehicle when we found out we were expecting our first baby.  We had suffered many years with small, older vehicles and wanted a safe, comfortable and roomy vehicle now.  The first day of searching we found the Chevy Venture and we're in love!  We took it for a test drive and it could not have been any smoother...the look of the van was also very appealing.  The van has plenty of room, actually can fit up to 7-8 adults.  There is a automatic door on one side, that slides by a touch or pushing of a button in the vehicle or on the keyless device. The door on the other side, you can pull open or shut manually.  It will be a great help when you have to get a child in that car seat hehehe  But we have found right now it is great when you have many individuals riding with you or when you do your grocery shopping.  The trunk has so much room as well for storage, shopping, or transporting anything.  Also the seats are removable so if you wish to take out some of the seats, create more room in the back, you simply remove them!  Our minivan is so nice because it has so many wonderful features such as automatic windows, child safety locks, keyless locks, cd player, computerized display(directional display, temperature, time, and gas per mile and how much you start with and have at the current time;gas used)  I have to say, that the gas mileage is fabulous!!!!  We are now thinking about adding the feature of a tv/vcr in the minivan, like in the tv commercial, for the baby hehehe and my husband LOL This minivan is such a wonderful vehicle and one every family should own!<br><br>
