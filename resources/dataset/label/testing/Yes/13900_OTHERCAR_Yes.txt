            I first learned of the Saturn brand back in the late '80s from an article in Popular Science magazine.  I was intrigued by the novel way this car company proposed to make and sell vehicles.

My first Saturn was the 1991 SC (bought in 1990).  It had a few manufacturing flaws but Saturn (both the company and the local retailers) bent over backwards to make everything right as conveniently as possible.

Over the years I've upgraded to the 1993 Saturn SC2 (renamed from just &quot;SC&quot;), the 1997 SC2 and have just accepted delivery of a 2001 SC2 Special Edition.

The car buying experience was as easy and comfortable as it was ten years ago.  No pressure, no unanswered or questions or misleading answers and no annoying car salesman double-talk.

The car itself is more refined than ever.  The RAD (rear access door) was added after my 1997 purchase so this is the first SC2 I've owned with this novel feature.  You'll use it more than you think!  The redesigned interior is thoughtfully done and ergonomically sound (I'm a Human Factors Engineer so I look for that kind of stuff).  The exterior is not a revolutionary change from the 1997 (the last time Saturn changed the coupe's body style) but is a refreshing change.  While I feel that some road and engine noise is acceptable in a coupe, the Saturns have always been a little louder than most.  The 2001 SC2 is noticeably quieter than my 97 was.

Overall, I love the company, the retailers and the car.  Four Saturn SC's over 10 years...  what more can I say?  By the way, this 2001 SC2 is my first non-red Saturn; it's the hot special-edition yellow :-)

As always, your mileage may vary :-)<br><br>
