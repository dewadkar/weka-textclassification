            This is the low end of Lexus cars but it is THE GREATEST car I have ever ridden in for $30,000. The optional 8-speaker, 6 CD changer stereo system is incredible and I have found nobody to disagree with me yet. Perfect for long road trips and even better for a quick trip to the store. Gives you the look of a classy, business man even if you are not. The only problem I have had is small things, like the clip to the glove department opener fell off, but other than that I have not had a single problem at all. The Lexus ES300 is excellently priced for it's great handling and power. It tops out at 140 so you'll never have a problem with keeping up with the pack and it has great acceleration and you can feel the power behind it as you start off after sitting at a red light. All in all this is one of the greatest luxury cars available for under $50,000.<br><br>
