            I purchased this vehicle new off the lot.  The reasons I chose this model, a 4-dr. sedan was because it was a great family car.  We have three kids so we had to have a roomy back seat.  Price was also a consideration with retail at $16,995 which wasn't too bad.  Mileage was rated at 21mpg on the highway and 19mpg for city driving. 

I didn't have the car long before strange things started happening.  I would be driving down the road at night with headlights on and the dash lights would go OUT or start FLASHING.  I returned to the service department the very next day and the car was checked but nothing was found wrong with it.  That very same night the interior lights on the rear view mirror and overhead light came ON and stayed ON.  Back to the dealer.  No cause found.  

The next big problem that started happening was when I would pull in driveway at night and cut off the ignition and headlights all the interior lights would stay ON and I would wake up to a dead battery.  My husband charged the battery and back to the dealer's shop we go.  I left the car all day with them so they could &quot;observe&quot; it.  Nothing, no lights came on when they were not supposed to, none went off when they were supposed to be on.  So I bring the car back home.  

A few days later I have another dead battery so I call the shop to tow the car in to the shop this time.  I figured if I could inconvenience them a bit maybe they would get serious and find the cause of the problem.  Actually, the men at the service department thought I was a little on the &quot;crazy&quot; side!  

However, after a couple of tow trips they did find a wire that the factory forgot to untape and attach to proper area.  Finally the electrical nightmare is over, but this all took place over several months!  If you are buying this model used be sure you know the history of it!  I've always called it my &quot;possessed&quot; car!<br><br>
