            I've tried most cameras around the 1 megapixel mark, including the Fuji 1300 and 1400 whilst looking for a model for work (see my reviews) but the camera I bought for my own use is the Kodak DC 215.

In theory at a fraction under a Megapixel it shouldn't produce results that compete with 1.3 Megapixel cameras, but in terms of the increase increase in printable area .3 megapixels is very small and resolution isn't the be all and end all of a good camera...

The DC215 isn't going to set the world alight with its image quality but its one of the best in its price band and under the right conditions capable of very good 6x4's and acceptable 7x5's. In areas of exceptionally fine detail e.g. close up of cat fur you can just tell the difference between a 'real' photo and the digital but for general scenes you are unlikely to tell the difference. To be honest when it comes to exceptionally fine detail you need above 3 megapixel before you start losing that 'digital feel'.

Colour is excellent - better than many cameras at twice the price.

White balance is superb for an automatic.

Macro focus is sharp (and easy to switch on with a separate button) if a little fiddly.

Close and mid-range shots are generally pretty sharp but distance shots do suffer grom a little softness (not terribly out of focus but a tad too soft). If you shoot landscapes try and get some foreground interest (always a good tip anyway).

Indoor shots are generally very good, the flash is powerful enough for small to average size rooms and gives very clean crisp images. Red-eye if not completely absent is noticeably better than most cameras of this size. The separate flash control button is a nice touch.

The wider than usual zoom is nice (29mm - 58mm), I prefer that extra width even at the expense of a bit of telephoto. The rocker switch is smooth to operate and the optical viewfinder adjusts accordingly.

The main LCD isn't stunning particularly in very lowlight or exceptionally bright light but its not too bad and is pretty accurate for framing (better than many).

Controls are well placed and you don't really need to read the manual to work out the operation.

I have an old fashioned preference for metal bodied cameras and whilst this is more of a metal 'skin' it's pretty robust with a nice heft to the hand. The rubber gribs and left thumb indentation provide a comfortable steady two-handed hold. The metal tripod socket is a good feature but awkwardly placed because of the unusual tray battery compartment - it does mean that you change batteries whilst fixed to a tripod though. It's a pity Kodak don't provide a second tray, it would make the design a lot more useful.
One aspect of the design I don't like is the compact flash slot door it's a bit on the flimsy side, and the release mechanism is a touch fiddly. Still I do prefer the duability of Compact Flash to smart media and the camera will still function if the door does break. Sockets are covered with strong rubber sockets, and for us European users its nice to see PAL supported.

The camera is serial only so I bought a USB card reader (the Sandisk one works well) some additions of the camera come with one, mine didn't.

Depending on the colour version you buy the camera comes with either a 4mb or 8mb card - I upgraded to 32mb to give 112 maximum quality photos.

Battery life isn't stunning but about average - around 120 exposures with occasional use of the LCD.

All in all its a great camera if you don't need large prints. Not without its drawbacks but pretty good.
