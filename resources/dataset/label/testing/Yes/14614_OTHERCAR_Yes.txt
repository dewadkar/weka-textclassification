            We bought a 1992 Mitsubishi Expo LRV Sport in Early 1993.  We wanted a 5-speed with power windows, locks, crusie and ABS.  We didn't care what color, we wanted this car.  They found one three states away, and drove it up to Minnesota. After literally being kicked out of a dealership (wouldn't give our deposit back after finding the car at a different dealer, got money, but they told us to never come back,) we finnaly got our Amazon Blue Expo LRV. 

We immediatley took the car on a 2500 mile trip.  ZERO problems.  Infact, this car was perfect until it got hit head on by another car. (No one was in the vehicle at the time.)  

After that, the sliding door never closed right; the frame probably got bent.  

This was the most versitle car I have ever seen.  The rear bench seat both folded up AND came out.  There were things that the Expo could get in it that our Montero Sport couldn't!  There was literally NOTHING we couldn't fit in this car.  If it didn't go in it, it went on the roof rack.  

However, not all was cheery with this car.  Once 100,000 miles rolled on this car, things started to go wrong.  Clucth went out, and cost $900 to replace.  The brakes needed to be replaced for the FIRST TIME (85,000 miles) and had to be redone THREE TIMES after the first brake job.  Little things such as the rear hatch started to rattle a lot.  There was an unidentifiable clicking sound too...

"Must be the CV joints," said a mechanic.  

Ok, so I had the CV joints looked at.  They indeed needed to be replaced.  The dealership then told me they would have to "remanufacture" the CV joint because they didn't make the part anymore.  Okay, fine.  

Got the car back after about a week at the dealership.  The clicking was STILL THERE!  

A week after getting the car back, I took off from a stop sign.  A crunch came from the front end, then a grinding sound, then I couldn't get into gear!  I coasted into a nearby parking lot.  Looked under the front of the car, and the CV joint was HANGING DOWN!  

Stuck in Small Town USA, I had it towed to the Plymouth dealer. (they made a twin of the car called the Colt Vista/Eagle Summit wagon.)  

They fixed it and billed the Mitsubishi dealership in Minneapolis.  Why?

According to the mechanic at the Plymouth dealer, the Mitsubishi dealer installed the WRONG CV JOINTS, it was TOO SHORT.  So when I drove, it added extra stress to the joint, untill if finally broke...again.  

Overall, this car was a gem.  Great in snow, great milage, and great cargo capacity.  However, mine sort of went down hill at 100K.
