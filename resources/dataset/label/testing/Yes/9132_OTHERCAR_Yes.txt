            This car is Great.I don't actually own one but being a dealer myself I can compare these cars. In my opinion, I think that the Lincoln Navigator is the best for a car of this size. This car has all the luxery that you want. This car has gorgeous wood grain interior, and the exterior has a sleek design. I believe that the Lincoln Navigator is the best vehicle in the class beating the Ford Expidition and the Cadillac Escalade. The handeling on this vehicle is a little difficult compared to what I am used to because of its size. But I could get used to it. This car is so safe and classy. I can't think of any other car of this size that could give you as much satisfaction as this car. There is also so much room in this car. I take my family on road trips all the time and they have so much room in the back to spread out and not be cramped and squished up with all the bags. I also love the stereo system in this car. The sound is incredible. Its a beautiful car and it is worth all the money. I guarentee you will not regret it. I hope this helped some of you out and I encourage you, if you have your eye on this car, not to hesitate. You aren't just paying for the name, you are paying for all the comfort and luxurious details that will make you feel like a King (or queen.)<br><br>
