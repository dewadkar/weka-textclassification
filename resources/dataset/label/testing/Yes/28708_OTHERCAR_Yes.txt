            I have been driving the RT for about 8 months now. It is a souped-up version of the standard Neon, the only model I could get (living in Mexico) that had a stick shift. From the start, the car has been a blast to drive. Down here, there are basically no speed limits, so I can use the car to it's full potential, and it rocks! It is light, which translates to quick acceleration, easy steering, working suspension, etc.
We actually drove to Cancun in this car, a 6000 km round trip, and enjoyed the ride as much as the sights. The gas mileage is good, seats comfortable, roomy enough. The owners manual says to use premium gas only, which I have been following, but don't know if it is really necessary.
The RT model come pretty much fully loaded with all the goodies you would ever want, including a sunroof and a four disk CD changer in the dash.
I have driven the competition to this car while on business trips and can honestly say that it ranks way above them. Even the standard Neon pales in comparison, mostly because it is underpowered and lacks the fun factor of the stick shift.
All prospective Neon buyers, please consider spending a few dollars more to upgrade to the RT, you will not regret it!
