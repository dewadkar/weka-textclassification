            A hundred miles and the gas gauge barely moved! That's great, but I what was really unbelievable was how much stuff you could put into one these tiny little cars!

This tiny little hatchback appears to be <i>very</i> small, but when you compare it side by side with many other cars, the load capacity of this car is incredible.

When I was told that we could use it to haul furniture, I nearly fell over laughing. Well, I'm not laughing any more. That tiny little hatchback actually carried a bigger load than my larger Chevy Celebrity, or my Chevy Cavalier!

Just fold the back seat down, open the hatch, and fill it up! You won't believe how much you can fit into one of these.

Then, check out the gas mileage. It is really incredible when you go from a larger car, then drive one of these. 

I've borrowed this car from my parents several times for trips I've taken by myself across the state. I'd like to buy one for myself, but due to the size of my family, it just wouldn't be very practical. I would love to have one as a second car, for trips when I didn't take the kids along.

This car would be great for singles or couples with no more than 2 kids since it has so little seating space. I have put the 3 younger kids in the back without a problem, but it is a bit crowded. 

It seems to be very dependable. I have used it on many occasions, and never had any problems with it. It is a bit compact, but not too bad. I've also ridden in the back and it was not too bad unless the front seat passenger put the seat back.

One thing I didn't care for was the automatic seatbelts. As soon as you start the car they come at you. It was quite a surprise the first time!

It drove fine, but did rattle a bit at expressway speeds. It was fine up to about 67 mph, but anything beyond that would rattle the car a little.

All together it was a nice ride and is good dependable transportation, for a good price.
