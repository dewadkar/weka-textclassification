            I have a 1991 Chevy C1500 "Cheyenne" also with about 72,000 miles. I had bought new it towards the end of the recession (in January 1992 -- it was mfg. Fall 1990).

The original rear-end differential went out early and was repaired no cost under warrantee. I understand that was a BIG problem with some 1991 vehicles. Repair took almost two weeks at the dealer. But with a good differential I've had no more major drive train problems.  One tuneup so far a few years ago (replaced spark plugs, spark plug wires and a few other things).

It is on the third idler arm -- I understand from the shop that that is another weak part of the design. Needed about every four years 30,000 miles. 

Yes, the doors' armrest pads (tops) were absolutely terrible.  I went to the local Chevy dealer and they got new ones for $30 each (correct color too).  I think I got lucky.  While I was at it I also paid $8 for new rubber on the brake pedal.

It is the only vehicle I've ever had where a flywheel pulley cracked and fell off. While I was idling waiting in a drive-through line. 

I have the factory radio and tape player.  Now I see what JRocket is talking about.  The radio control panel is above the AC / defroster / heat panel.  The cassette tape is over to the right from that.  Yes, these controls all take some getting used to, but that is true of many vehicles.

The AC / defroster / heat controls are computerized.  I think the computer takes a little while to wake up sometimes.

The dome light comes on with the drivers door.  And there is no switch for the passenger side door to activate the dome light.

The vehicle has anti-lock brakes on the back axle.  Good idea because I guarantee the rear wheels are always be the first to lock up if not carrying a load.  So that is as good as 4-wheel anti-lock brakes.

EA94-038 GM, S/T PICKUP AND UTILITY, 1991-1994 ABS BRAKING SYSTEM FAILURE 10/31/1994
When mine went out and the dummy light came on I took it in to the dealer.  They said the ABS computer had failed and needed replaced along with its fuse in the fuse panel.  I kept the original computer because I thought what a dummy I was for not checking to see that maybe only the fuse was blown before going to the dealer.  Maybe the dealer was right that the original ABS computer had failed.

I don't think I could have had many of the problems they specify.  Mine doesn't have an air bag (so 99-09-41-004  doesn't make sense does it?).  I also have no cup holder that I know of.  Do real men need cup holders?  With power steering, power brakes and automatic transmission I have a free hand to hold my coffee in the morning.

The truck has a good fuse panel.

Almost any vehicle of that time period has really lousy original paint that peels.  I think as a result of EPA regulations that were still new at the time.  I had mine re-painted (the polyurethane paint job) a few years ago at Maaco, so it looks good. The Maaco paint job was good.  And I polished then painted the rear bumper with black rustoleum so the truck looks good on the outside.  There is a patterned black plastic sheet over the top of the metal bumper that I left in place and painted over as well.  The jury is still out on my paint work, but so far it looks great to me.

Gas mileage on my 350 Cubic Inch automatic is about 12-14 in town. A little better on highway in overdrive. But the 35 gallon gas tank will get you as far as 500 miles or more on a highway before having to stop for gas.

The AC has always been cold and has never needed anything at all. 

With as little driving as I do, I expect it could last and that I will keep it another 10 years. I have rubber mats, the short cab and a long bed (with bed liner). My other vehicle is bigger so I really don't have the feeling that it is big and hard to drive because I'm used to it. I remember some cars were much bigger (longer) in the late 60's.  I recommend that if you have a pickup truck and use the back, get a good heavy ribbed bed liner, take it off and wash under it once a year or so.

I'm on the third alternator, but just had the original hoses replaced. Headlight switch broke and was about $70 to replace (it required replacing quite a bit of the dash). Repair parts are easy to get. I like that you can buy headlights, light bulbs, filters in Walmart, K-Mart or almost anywhere.  I'm still on the original engine and transmission.  I understand that replacement of those is sometimes done when people keep their Chevy trucks for up to 500,000 miles or more.  I use Mobil 1 0W30 oil and the PureOne Purolator oil filters.

I got some 10" wide 15" wheels and put low profile 275 60 R15 tires on it so it has very good winter traction even though 2WD (as long as weight is in the bed). And extremely good stopping with the wider tires. That size tire doesn't look unusual at all because the truck is large. It almost seems like that is what should have been original equipment. 

The wider tires also means that I can drive on my lawn and not leave tracks. So it is good for gardening. I have had as much as 3,500 pounds of dirt in the back (gross weight almost 8,000 lbs at the county landfill scales). But be careful when overloading not to corner very fast at all or to hit bumps. Again note that this is with the much wider tires. The original size tires or wheels may not carry that weight.  And I'm sure I have also helped the suspension somehow (perhaps with load bearing shocks, etc).  I don't advise to abuse your truck.  If you keep within the weight guidelines in the owners manual, I think you will find the truck easily performs its tasks without strain.

The large windows are really good. You can see really well. I always park somewhere so I don't have to back up. It fits into city parking garages if you must do so, as long as the parking spot is big enough. The turning radius is rather large (I have the long bed) so I'm glad I don't park in a city parking garage very often at all.

I said good for big people.  I have the bench seat.  Tall people (I'm 6'3") will not have a problem with head room or leg room.  Unless you wear a big hat.

The manual seat belts are comfortable.  I appreciate that they aren't electric and slide along the door.  I always wear seat belts and do not like the "automatic" kinds.  My seat belts were Bendix and Chevrolet also used TRW seat belts that same year.  The inside of one Bendix buckle recently broke.  The dealer was able to order me a "center" seat belt kit for about $115.  Initially they got a TRW in.  The parts guy said seat belt parts are very easy to get mixed up (Chevrolet cars).  The seat belt parts must match manufacturer and type within a vehicle.  Mixing parts is unsafe and often not functional.  So now my seat belts are fine.

No air bag.  Some may consider this a plus.  The horn is easy to figure out (center of steering wheel).

I said about once a year or less often trip to a garage for repairs.  When I take it in, I get all done that needs fixed and whatever I anticipate to go out within the next year.  Some people with the same problems may have made more frequent trips to a garage for repairs.  I tend to save problems to lump together when possible and get repairs only when something was wrong that I couldn't live with.  Currently, repairs and upkeep is about $800 a year (including $160/year for four oil changes).  Virginia personal property tax on a new vehicle could easily be half that much (and it is currently valued and gets much lower tax).  Those who live in such states understand that it is good from a tax point of view to have a reliable older vehicle that works really well.

I got hit from behind once at a stop light by a van on a rainy day.  It really bent the rear license plate.  Didn't feel a thing.  Just heard the noise.  No damage to the truck except the license plate was mashed.  Perhaps the rear bumper moved in by about 1/10 of an inch.  But I didn't see anything at all at the time.  It looked like more than $1,000 damage on the van (full size van not a minivan).  We didn't get whiplash either.  So either Chester's bumper and stance is pretty strong or guardian angels were looking out.  Who knows.  My wife was with me and expecting so you know the child's angel was there.

The rear bumper is a Class 1 rated tow with holes already there for a ball hitch and chains.  And wiring is already present for Class 1 trailering.  You may need a wiring adapter for your exact application.

If you regularly do heavier trailering, perhaps a heavier vehicle is better.

My daughter recently got her drivers license.  I told her the truck really drives nice.  At last she tried it out.  She had very low expectations.  Yet after driving it, she remarked that it was very smooth driving.  And that it was easier to drive than the smaller drivers ed car.  I think she said that because the visibility is so much better.  And she knows that it brakes very well with the wide tires.
