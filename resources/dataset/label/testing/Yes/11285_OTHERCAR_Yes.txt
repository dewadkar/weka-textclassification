            Back in the dim mists of time when poor, confused President Johnson wondered where he went wrong with his Vietnam policy, your average, red-blooded American youth lusted for a new Mustang with a 428, multiple-carbs and a prom queen. I was driving a vehicle that resembled more a product by Dinky or Matchbox than an car. My beloved '66 Fiat 600D was so small that two of us could pick up the front end and facilitate parking it in places usually reserved for Vespas. 

This was a time when your average luxo-barge got 10mpg. Cruise control was a thick cable attached to the gas pedal and what appeared to be an old, oil dipstick.....suffice to say it was not well appointed. I say all this, but I loved that little car. It came to a sad end one dark, cool October evening when an alcohol-enriched teenage in a behemoth of a Chrysler Imperial attempted to negotiate the turn in front of my apartment and sadly, reduced the width of the poor Fiat by half. Ciao bella.....

I bring this up only because I think I finally found a small car that is as interesting, and exciting to drive as that little Topolino. The Protege5 seems to answer that that question of just what can I buy that is stunning to be seen in, gets great gas mileage, isn't going to leave me stranded and maybe most important, is going to allow me to eat regular meals because the payments won't put me on a semi-regular diet of food that exists only in cans and micro-waveable pouches.

I tend to buy cars for the long haul. My trade-in on this Mazda was an '89 Honda Civic Wagon with over 300k on the clock. It was probably the state of the art small car when it was new and the Protege5 is its' closest equal. It comes with air conditioning, power everything, custom wheels, body kit and fog lamps as well as a list of standard items that was unheard of in my Fiat's time and were expensive options in my Honda's.

I've read other reviews that complain about only having 130hp to play with. The first week I owned the car, I took it up Angeles Crest Hwy in the foothills above Los Angeles. This is the same road-o'fun that all the major car mags flog their test cars up and down. I was unable to break the
rear end loose in wonderful, right hand sweepers where I was hitting 65-70 in third. The handling is tight, and the engine is very responsive. The five speed has delicious, short throws and you can even heel-and-toe those shifts with very little thought. All this and over 30mpg.....what more could you ask for.....zoom, zoom, zoooom!

The interior feels like a car costing many thousands more. The thick little steering wheel reminds me of the ones on my old Alfas. I'm over six feet, and I feel like I'm not a prisoner, though with those very smart 16" wheels and 195-50 tires, it sometimes seem that I'm staring up at the rocker-panels of every other SUV. 

I bought the classic red, and those boys in Hiroshima really know how to paint a car. No orange-peel, no blemishes......even in places that nobody sees.

You can buy a more powerful small wagon with more bells and whistles. All it takes is money; but for the price, this little car does a great job of answering a lot of those pesky automotive questions that keeps us awake until the wee hours. And I didn't have to learn Italian to read the owner's manual.
