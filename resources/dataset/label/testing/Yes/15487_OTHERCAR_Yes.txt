            This camera is a good unit for the money. The resolution is excellent,looks as good if not better then paper prints, on the outside shots. The unit could use some improvement on the white balance on indoor shots. The camera does tend to wash out the indoor shots with a flash and produce dark shots without the flash. But that's what imaging software was developed for, so I don't mind. But on the outdoor shots it is picture perfect, without any touch ups. I love the fact that it dumps directly to a 3.5&quot; disk, which five you as many shots as you have disks. You can fit average of 20 shots in the 640x480 mode and less in the larger formats. It does include 3 sizes, 640x480 1024x768 and 1280x960. The camera allows you to take 1 minute mpeg movies, which I don't think any of the others can do. The camera also has a decent size LCD screen to view the pic, right when it was taken. You can also format and delete pics from the disk right from the camera. The camera also gives you the flexibility of doing some manuel photography, because you change the fstop and have manuel focus.

So Overall I love my camera and hope others will make the same smart move and purchase one...    <br><br>
