            This thing is a tank except for one thing- the electric systems.  Alternator blew at 30K, problems with power window motors, and CD changer was replaced(under warranty).  However, the engine and transmission has been a jewel.  The only recommendation if you are looking to purchase a used Jetta is forego most of the power options and you should remain pretty happy.  Furthermore, factory seat warmers on my vehicle certainly catch most people by surprise. 

The boxy styling of my K2 version with the sport package(factory blacked out tail lamps, spoiler, wheels) has certainly made this car mistaken for much more expensive cars many of times.  

If you are getting a 4 cylinder, make sure you get a 5-speed as the automatic is just about lethargic.  Even the 155hp 4 cylinder 5-speed leaves something to be desired. Power is on par with most economy cars, which with the options of this car one would like to think that they are a far step above that.  The suspension is great and really allows you to feel the road like a sports car without being harsh-
has a Teutonic feel of most German cars, which tend to be driver cars.  Cornering is fair, and long road trips in the car are fairly comfortable.  

The only other complaint would be the controls below the radio that run from left to right, while they look really good, are not exactly ergonomically correct.  Also if you do purchase one of these vehicles, make sure you get a wood grain kit from one of the online stores, should run about $250, but it makes all the difference in the world with the interior appearance.  

The only thing is that I have found that with miles, these cars to tend to depreciate faster than Japanese models, so it is a much better used buy than new.<br><br>
