            The price almost stopped us from buying this fantastic camera. I am glad it didn't.

My husband's camera had been broken for a few years. After we got this camera his passion for photography came back. I even got into the spirit of things. 

It looks more complicated to use then it was. I have no problem taking photos. 

I love the lcd screen we can look through so we don't have to focus using one of those peepholes on most cameras. It also uses floppy disks, which cost almost nothing now. And no pricey add-ons had to be bought. The 2 hour rechargeable battery came with it. 

The MVC has steady shot so even my untrained hands can take really good pictures. The pictures are really sharp and are at high resolution. The zoom works at the flip of a finger. 

Another fun feature is the ability to look at the pictures right on the LCD screen. It's tricky on the eye though because it looks darker than the pictures turn out. The camera also has a mpeg movie capabilities. But the movies are very short if you take them at high resolutions and grainy if you take them at low resolution.

If you want to get excited about photography and take excellent pictures (unlike those cheap digital cameras) this is the camera for you.
