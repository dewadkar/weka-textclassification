            We got the astro with about 6000 miles on the odo and down the road we've had various troubles. The rear a/c went out on us, but that was fixed under warranty. Just recently the steering play became very large, and it came to the point where the van didn't drive in the direction where you pointed!! The tie rods were shot, that cost about 600 bucks! For a while the oil pressure gauge went totally haywire. A few things about the interior: rattle, squeek, rattle. The front bucket seats are ok, but the seats in the back are no good. There are some great pluses about the van. It handles the weather extreamely well. It's equipped with ABS and AWD. What a pleasure to drive in the snow. You can plow through the snow while everyone else gets stuck. Need a lift? It's also relatively easy to park considering it's a van and seats eight decently.<br><br>
