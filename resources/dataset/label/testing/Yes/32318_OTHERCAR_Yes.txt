            I was in search of a new car that would meet the needs of a family of three and yet give me the convertible that I wanted.  I looked at every manufacturer of convertibles and I am very happy with the selection of the Volvo C70 convertible.  One thing I wanted was the safety in a car.  The Volvo C70 is a very well built car and I found out it is totally hand made!  The fit and finish is very exact.  All seams, corners, etc fit perfectly.

It had the best safety features  of all the cars I looked at. If any two wheels should leave the road at the same time it has built in roll bars that pop up for safety.  I did not find that in any American convertible.  There is lots of reinforcement structurally to make this a sound and safe car.

I compared other European cars for safety,and dollar value for what you get.  The BMW was nice but for the same money as the Volvo C70 I was getting the lower end of their convertibles, I also looked at the Mercedes.  It was a lovely car and has a very good safety record, but for the same features as the Volvo C70 it was priced $15,000. higher.  Both Volvo and Mercedes had European delivery which really looks like an interesting way to take delivery of your car and see parts of Europe but in the end I took delivery here in America. I also looked at the Saab.  It also has a good record for safety but in the final choice I like the design of the Volvo C70 over the Saab.  I also like the leather that was in the Volvo C70 better then the leather they use in the Saab.  I like the looks of the dash and the wood package. It has dual heated front seats and dual memory seats with three memories for each seat.  There is plenty of room in the back seat for me to sit behind my husband and for him to move the seat all the way back for his driving comfort.  Finally I liked the idea that the Volvo C70 was a hand built car (the only one by the way that is hand built in the Volvo line).

This car is front wheel drive and I bought the high turbo with the automatic transmission.  It is a rocket!

The one draw back is the size of the trunk.  It is small for luggage but will hold two sets of golf clubs.  I do not have any  problem getting all the groceries that I need into the trunk.  It is nice as there is a pass thru to the back seat for long pieces of wood or snow skis.

I upgraded to the 17" tires and upgraded the wheels.  This car even has wipers on the headlights to keep them clear and rain free!  (of course living in Arizona I do not plan on using them much!)

Volvo also offered fantastic financing, and a 40,000 mile 5 year warrenty with a roadside package that as good as our AAA.  I have cancelled our AAA membership so that is a small savings.

So dollar value, safety, and design made up my mind in buying the Volvo C70 Convertible.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
