            Anyone should buy this car because it is so great.  You can basically summarize this vehicle as a powerful and stylish family vehicle.  It has plenty of room for the kids (even enough room in the back seats for adults to comfortably sit in.  It has dual zone heating and air-conditioning, and it is very safe with state of the art front airbags and side airbags.  The ride is so quiet that if you are sleeping, you don't know if you are actually moving or parked.  When sitting inside the car and starting it up, I sometimes start it up once it is already started because I don't even hear or feel it start up.  It handles excellently with it's rack and pinion steering and i is very powerful.  I can easily get up to highway speed in no time.  The brakes are also another great feature, with 4 wheel disc brakes, one can easily stop in a hurry.  The computer inside dashboard makes the inside look very modernized (which it is).  The sound system is one of my favorite parts about the vehicle.  It has a 6 disc cd changer as well as cassette and am/fm radio.  The 7 JBL speakers and 1 subwuffer are very realistic sounding and can be played on a very high volume and not be blown (experience).  It is so quiet that I turned the volume up extremely high and then shut all the doors, and I could barely hear it outside.  The leather seats are the good type of leather and not the hard leather seats that feel like you're sitting on a bleacher;  It is very soft, but it sturdy enough to keep you from sinking in.      It surprised me, that the first time I looked in the trunk; I realized that the trunk was huge, especcially for a sedan.  It is loiterally huge, and if you have long stuff that won't fit in the trunk, the middle console form the back seat folds down.         The exterior looks very chic and stylish, but it looks kind of bland.  The cuts and curves of the exterior makes it look very new and cool, but there is nothing neat about it (if you know what I mean).     Overall it is a great car because it is very safe, stylosh, up-to-sate technology, and it has a great engine.  <br><br>
