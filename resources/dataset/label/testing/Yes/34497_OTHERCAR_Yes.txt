            The regular cab is available in the short box at 108.3 inches in wheelbase length, the long box at 117.9 inches in wheelbase length and extended cab versions at 122.9 inches in wheelbase length. This comes to a 6 foot bed for the short box and extended cab and a 7 1/3 foot bed for the long box.

You can get the S-10 in a two-wheel (rear-wheel drive) drive version or a four-wheel (4x4) drive version. 

The two-wheel drive S-10 pickup comes standard with a 120-horsepower 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission. You can get an optional 180-horsepower 4.3-liter V6 that will move on!

The four-wheel drive S-10 comes standard with a beefed up 190 horsepower 4.3-liter V6 and a 5-speed manual transmission. Both two-wheel and four-wheel are available with an optional 4-speed automatic transmission.

Now they also offer two S-10 package deals, the ZR2 and the Xtreme. The ZR2 is a wide stance sport performance package, it comes with a stronger frame, a higher height and a wider track. This little pickup is made to go off road! The Xtreme is lower in height and has some nice details with it, if you like a low rider, then the Xtreme is built for you.

<b>The Ride</b>
The ride wasn?t bad, it rides like a pickup. Now the full size Chevy pickups ride like a car. The ride was fairly quiet and didn?t pick up much road noise. Corner wasn?t a problem, it seem to corner any of the curves at the recommended speeds.

The 4.3 V-6 with 180 HP will move on out, this is a powerful V-6 engine. It will take you from 0 to 55 in no time at all, I do believe this 4.3 V-6 will outrun several V-8?s. 

Braking was normal, you couldn?t lock them up due to the ant lock brakes.

<b>The Mileage </b>
The kind of gas mileage these days seem to matter a lot, so here are the EPA Estimated Miles Per Gallon.

The 2.2-liter 4cylinder with the manual transmission is rated at 22 MPG for the city and 28 MPG for the highway.

The 2.2-liter 4cylinder with the automatic transmission is rated at 19 MPG for the city and 25 MPG for the highway.

The 4.3-liter 6cylinder with the manual transmission is rated at 16 MPG for the city and 22 MPG for the highway.

The 4.3-liter 6cylinder with the automatic transmission is rated at 17 MPG for the city and 22 MPG for the highway.

Now the four-wheel drive version is rated at 15 MPG for the city and 18 MPG for the highway with both transmissions.

<b>Overall</b>
I tested out a two-wheel drive S-10 pickup with a six-foot bed, automatic transmission and the 4.3 V-6 engine in it. List price on it was $13,878.00, $1,095.00 for the automatic transmission, $1,295.00 for the $4.3 V-6 engine, a destination charge of $585.00 and a few other options bringing the total to $17, 343.00.

There are several rebates from $1,000 to $2,000 available depending on where you live and what engine you get, so check out your local dealer for the best price and rebate available.

The S-10 comes with the standard GM warranty of 3-years or 36,000-miles Limited Bumper-to-Bumper, which ever comes first. Plus you get 3-years or 36,000-miles 24-hr Roadside Assistance and 6-years or 100,000-miles of Sheet Metal Rust-Thru.

I highly recommend the 2001 Chevy S-10 regular cab.
