            I bought this camera after checking out a lot of reviews all across the web. I was most interested in the CD-R capability to write onto 3" CDs, instead of flash cards. 

I prefer to take max quality photos in most cases, and this is the best way to store a lot of images. You can get the CDs for as little as 75 cents each, and a CD will hold about 66 full size images. 

The other bonus is that the CDs can be read by most computers with a CD drive. And the CDs are their own "archive". Forget flash cards, cables, and the rest!

The camera functionality is easy to learn, and it is all menu driven via a larger than normal LCD display panel on the back. There is no "viewfinder", but that has not been a problem at all, except in dark lit situations. Even then, it is manageable.

This camera is larger in size than most other digitals, because it must accommodate the CDs. But it is actually very light for it's size, and well built. 

And it takes *excellent* photos. Everyone raves about them. 

When you zoom in close, you do get noticeable "artifacts", especially in flash conditions, but every digital in this price range will do the same. 

I recommend that you purchase an additional battery. 

Great camera!
