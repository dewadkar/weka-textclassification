            I now have 2,000 miles on a Dodge Neon R/T that I purchased a month ago. I bought this car as my commuter and to save miles on 2003 Chrysler Sebring that I bought. In alot of ways, this little car has been a pleasant suprise. I first test drove a Dodge Neon SRT-4 (the turbo), but I found the seats too uncomfortable. Additionally, I did not like the fact that the SRT-4 did not have a sunroof.

PROS:
-This car gets pretty good gas mileage (about 33MPG thus far). 
-There is plenty room for a big guy like myself. There is a good amount of headroom and it's roomy for a compact. 
-Suprisingly, the stereo is pretty good for a factory system.
-Although I wouldn't say the car is fast, it is "peppy".
From 0-60mph this car may even beat my 3.0L Sebring. 
-The car also hold the curves better than my Sebring. Even when hauling a## on the on-ramps, this car can really hold a curve. I never hear a screech and it never feels like I'm going to slide (60-75mph). 

CONS:
-The 6 Disc is virtually invisible and you can't load CD's easily while driving.
-There is a fair amount of road noise at highway speeds.
-Although I haven't sat in the back seat, they don't look like they would be very comfortable on medium-long distance trips. 
-The car has power front windows and roll-down rear windows for some God-forsaken reason. This is stupid.
-Again the car is not fast, but is somewhat quick. It's kind of sporty for an econo-box car.
-This is my biggest complaint about the car...The seats are comfortable, but the lower back area needs more bolster or cushioning to support my lower-back.

In sum, I would recommend this car as it hasn't had any problems yet. I've read other owners' complaints about Neons and wonder why they bought an an inexpensive car if they wanted luxury performance. I've read many complaints about head gasket on older models. Come on, this is an  inexpensive car (cheap car)and people don't expect pay anything in maintainance costs. I could understand if you bought an Accord, Camry, etc, but you sort of get what you pay for. 
   Well, I know it easy for me to say as I haven't had any trouble yet. Time will tell if this a good car.
