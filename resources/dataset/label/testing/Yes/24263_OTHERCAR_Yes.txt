            This is my first car, I am very happy with it's performance.
At the moment it has 126,000 miles on it.  I use it to drive to work, school, plus 120 miles every weekend.  So far the engine has run flawlessly.

My main likes about this car are it's looks.  Mine is silver with a black cloth top and with tons of chrome on the bottom of the left and right side, and the grill area contains much chrome as well.  Driving this vehicle in a small parking lot takes a little skill, and usually will scare your friends :P, because it's so huge.

The interior is extremely comfortable and VERY roomy.  However at 126K the driver's seat has broken, and the padding is completely shot.  The only thing that doesn't work on this car is the power windows, but sometimes when the temperature is around -10 degrees F. They work.

This car is fairly inexpensive to drive, the insurance is quite low, however as the vehicle becomes older it is rusting a lot.  The most recent repair at this time are the rear brake lines.  They became so rusted that they would not hold pressure any longer, most of the bolts and such holding the lines in had rusted and where difficult to remove.  The keyless entry, power trunk, power (don't know exactly if it's a "moon" or "sun" roof, but it's the biggest one iv'e seen.) roof still work fine.

Overall this has been a fairly reliable car with almost all the features still working fine.  Although I can forsee larger and larger repair bills as time progresses.

UPDATE: I donated it to volunteers of america, bought a 2002 saturn SL1.
