                Well, didn't everyone get a little Casio keyboard for Christmas one year or was that just me?  Seriously though, Casio has been producing digital cameras for a long time and now it looks as if they may have a 3 megapixel product to rival such digital camera icons such as Nikon and Olympus-the QV-3000 plus.   If you haven't noticed this little gem before my feeling is that you will soon.  Why? well Casio is bringing to the table a feature that neither Nikon or Olympus are matching-a microdrive. If you value storage then a microdrive is second to none.  Let's look at the features of the QV-3000 plus.

* A digital camera with 3.34 megapixel resolution;
* A 8mb memory flashcard <b> AND </b> a 340 mb microdrive;
* A 3x optical wide picture lens and a 2x digital lens;
* 3 different picture settings;
* 4 different lighting settings;
* AVI quicktime movies with 30 seconds of filming;
* The ability to select shutter speed and apeture settings;
* operates on double AA batteries.

<b> The Resolution </b>

    This Casio camera has true 3.34 megapixel resolution.  Photos are shot in either super high resolution (2048 x 1536) or normal resolution (1024 x 768).  What that means is that your going to get super web photos.  Normally a picture in JPEG format is recorded at 640 x320.  This camera has the power to handle these jobs with ease.  Also, printouts on a photo quality are going to come out looking sharp and clear.  Using photo paper even an 8 x 10 shot is going to look nice.  That means that this can be an all purpose camera.  It will never match the resolution of some of the high-end point and shoot cameras (around 6 million megapixel), but these are nice photos.  When you take into consideration that a digital camera also allows you to erase photos and retake the shot this camera will meet the needs of about 90% of the photographers out there.

<b> The lenses </b>  

By giving you both an optical and a digital lens this camera gives you flexibility and versatility.  The lenses can be used separately or simultaneously to give you up to 6x of zoom.  Shots can be done using either auto or manual focus.  The shutter speed can be adjusted and up to three photos can be taken in continuous succession.  

      This camera tries to work with you and the environment.  Picture settings include: landscape, night, and portrait.  Adjust your settings to compensate for light or apeture.  If you are unsure as to what setting is best then experiment.  Directions are easy to follow and in no time you'll be shooting like a pro. 

<b> Storage Capacity </b>

      This is what made me take notice of this Casio camera.  One of the biggest problems with Digital cameras is a lack of storage space.  As resolution increases, so does the demand for memory.  Most cameras on the market come with either a 8mb or 16mb card to store photographs.  If you own a 2 or 3 megapixel camera and can take photographs using a resolution of around (2040x1536)you can expect your memory card to fill up after 5 or 6 photos for the 8mb card or 10-12 for the 16 mb card.  The only way to free up the card is to download the photos or erase your work.  That's fine if your taking pictures around town, but what if your on a trip?  Wouldn't be nice to have a 340 mb drive.  Imagine being able to hold 200 of these photos without having to download your card.  Are you beginning to see the value of a microdrive?  Go to a camera shop and these drives will retail for $300 to $500 dollars alone.  Here though your getting the drive and a 3 megapixel camera for $999.  Not such a bad deal at all!

<b> Other features and accessories </b>

      Using a quicktime movie program this camera can also take 30 second AVI movies.  This is a nice little feature if you want to create an online album or e-mail your friends.  Also, the camera comes with a case and double AA batteries.  I would recommend that you consider purchasing rechargeable batteries and an adaptor.  When you operate this camera the LCD display stays on and it will drain the batteries quickly. To avoid any frustration, it would be best if you had a spare set of batteries to interchange if your camera gets a low battery signal.  The USB connection is fine for downloading information to your computer.   A reader is a purchase you might want to consider for convenience, but it is not a necessity.  
      If you've been eyeing a digital camera lately, then you might want to investigate the Casio QV-3000.  So many convenient features in this little package might push this camera towards the top of the heap in the 3 megapixel digital camera market.  Happy photographing.<br><br>
