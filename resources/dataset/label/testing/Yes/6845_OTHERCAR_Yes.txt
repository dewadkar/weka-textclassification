            When I went looking to purchase a new car, I had a few basic features I was looking for:  Automatic, A/C, Cruise Control, Power Windows, Power Locks, 4-door.  I wanted enough elbow room not to feel cramped when driving, and enough leg room in the back to accommodate a large adult.  

But most important was the safety features.  In addition to the dual air bags, I wanted impact crumple zones and steel impact beams in the doors.  The 2001 Mazda 626 had all of these features - and then some.  It also had back seats that folded down for additional cargo room, TWO trip odometers, a power outlet in the center storage area for my cell phone, swing air vents (I LOVE this feature!) and even a little holder for my sunglasses!

They even thought of the children with standard child safety locks in the back doors, locks for infant seats, and a trunk release inside the trunk.

This sedan has a smooth drive, all of the controls are within easy reach of the driver, and I was very pleased with the little comfort features, such as the keyless entry.  So far, the only negative item is that the noise level is a little high with traveling at high speeds on the road, but I have found this to be the case with most vehicles in this category.

Finally, I have to say I love the color of my car.  It is the most beautiful shade of blue!  Galaxy Blue Metallic, to be exact.  The interior is dark gray - a VERY nice combination.  I am very happy with my purchase!
