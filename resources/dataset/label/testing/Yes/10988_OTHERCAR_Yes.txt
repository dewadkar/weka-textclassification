               About 5 years ago we decided to purchase a mini van.   We couldn't afford brand new, so we sought out a used one.
  We looked into all the different makes and models, and decided that we prefered what the Chevy Astro Van had to offer.
  We were looking for something a little &quot;roomier&quot; and the other mini vans were more like a large station wagon.  Plus, Chevy was a name we trusted.
  We found a 1989 black Chevy Astro for sale by a private owner.  It had alot of miles on it, but we could live with that.  We also didn't like the fact that it was black.  A beautiful color, but not a smart color when you live in the HOT desert.
  We also loved the captains chairs instead of the bench seat  in the middle section.  And both seats reclined.  A very nice feature when you have 2 children that hate each other!  ha ha   They can each have their own seat, and either sit up or lay back when we go on long drives.
  Surprisingly, the van wasn't as much of a gas guzzler as we thought it would be !
  We've taken lots of loooong drives out-of-state over the years, and our van has never failed us.  We take out the back seat, hang our curtains, and put in our porta-potty.  Great for long trips and camp outs !
  Over the years we've had very few problems with our Astro.  The most major problem being the air conditioner.  We had that fixed and now it runs great.   I love the dual a/c feature.
  Our van is now 11 years old and still runs GREAT !  I don't foresee having to sell it for a long time.  In fact, we plan to get a new paint job soon !   I love my van, and would never own anything but a Chevy Astro in the future !<br><br>
