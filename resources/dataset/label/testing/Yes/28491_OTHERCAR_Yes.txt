            The Grand Cherokee has been Jeep's flagship since 1992.  Since its inception, the Grand Cherokee has always been aimed toward more upscale SUV buyers.  In 1999, the Grand Cherokee received its first redesign.  New for 2002 are 5 new models.  The Sport, with either rear or 4-wheel drive, the Special Edition, with rear or 4-wheel drive, and the Overland, which comes only with 4-wheel drive.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The Grand Cherokee was redesigned in 1999 with a more rounded body.  The Overland model adds a heavy-duty suspension and 17-inch alloy wheels.  All Grand Cherokees rest on a 105.9-inch long wheelbase-- shorter than most other SUV competitors.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The 6-cylinder engine is well-muffled even under full throttle.  Both V8 engines emit a smooth growl above about 3,000 rpm, and is quite refined below.  At speeds above 70 mph or so, wind noise is loud enough to where the point where I have to elevate my voices just to hold a conversation.  The controls are simple and well-marked.  Some models have wood interior accents that give the Grand Cherokee an even more luxurious feel.

There is a lot of head and leg room up front for the driver and passenger, and tall people (like myself), enjoy a commanding view of the road.  The seats themselves are a little on the soft side, but are nonetheless comfortable.  The rear seats are an entirely different story.  Leg room for taller folks are adequate at best, and the seatbacks are too upright to be comfortable for long drives.  With 72.3 cubic feet of cargo space, the Grand Cherokee is quite versatile.  Some competitors such as the Ford Explorer and Nissan Pathfinder do offer more cargo room, though.

<b>ENGINE</b>: All models, with the exception of the Overland come standard with a 4.0-liter OHV inline 6-cylinder engine.  It puts out 195 horsepower at 4,600 rpm, and 230 lb./ft. of torque at 3,000 rpm.  Optional on all models, again with the exception of the Overland, is a 4.7-liter OHC POWERTECH V8 engine.  It produces 235 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 295 lb./ft. of torque at 3,200 rpm.  Standard on the Overland and optional on the Limited is a high-output version of the V8.  It churns out 260 horsepower at 5,100 rpm and 330 lb./ft. of torque at 3,600 rpm.

With the 6-cylinder engine, acceleration is lively in most models except for the Limited 4WD model where it has the most weight to pull around (4,072 pounds).  The V8 engine is a more sensible choice if you need to tow heavy objects or haul a lot of cargo.  It accelerates VERY quickly off the line and has more than enough mid-range torque for highway passing.  With acceleration that would put even a Miatas to shame, the high-output V8 is quite powerful.  The 6-cylinder engine comes standard with a 4-speed automatic.  However, both V8s come standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

<b>HANDLING</b>:  Typical of most SUVs.  With either the 16-inch or 17-inch wheels, there is too much body lean and nosedive.  The brakes are very strong and reward the Grand Cherokee with unusually short stopping distances.

<b>RIDE</b>: Small bumps are easily absorbed, but large bumps can cause the Grand Cherokee to pitch laterally.  This is less noticeable with the 17-inch wheels.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: So far, the 2002 Grand Cherokee has had no recalls and I did not notice any glitches during the time of my test drive.

<b>VALUE</b>: The Jeep Grand Cherokee performs better than most SUV's in its class in terms of acceleration and styling.  Although some competitors are more versatile with larger trunk volumes, the Grand Cherokee is still an excellent SUV buy.
