            I have driven an Infiniti QX4 and have some good and some bad comments about it. I haven't driven or been in a Pathfinder, so I don't know how the more upscale version compares to the basic SUV. This year, Infiniti made some changes to the QX4, and I think that they are for the better. The engine now over 200 horsepower, compared with the 170 bhp in the model I drove. I found this to be the largest problem. It was really hard to get up to speed, and I didn't want to push the engine to its limits. It really just felt slow. The new version of the QX4 is also equipped with Xenon headights(for the people in the other cars, xenon appears somewhat blue, and just about blinds you).
The SUV feels a little big when you're driving it, somewhat bulky. The handling is good though. I don't think it is extraordinary, but it makes the drive smooth. The auto is pretty high off of the ground, and gives you a good view from the seats. The handling and steering are also good. I didn't really have a chance to do make any real sharp turns, but on the highway the drive was quiet and smooth. The new Pathfinder has water-filled joints to connect the different parts of the car together. This reduces interior noise. I don't think that the QX4 I drove was equipped with this system, but I imagine that the new QX4 is, since the new Pathfinder is. 
The interior impressed me more than any other part of this car. The seats are very comfortable, and offer as much, if not more support than most cars in this class. The design of all of the controls are also very good. The cup holder doesn't get in the way of the radio or climate controls, which is nice if you want to drink a coke and change the radio station. 
The headlights turn off and on when you turn the car on and off. This is really nice, and I feel is better than having them turn off after a few minutes. The rear seat is only really comfortable for two people, but for short trips, three is okay. The seats in the back are a little low to the ground, but overall, they are comfortable. I found that with a moonroof, the rear seat occupants lose a lot of headroom. I had to hold my head back a little to keep it from hitting the ceiling. I am only 5'11&quot;, and this was a problem for me. 
Overall, I liked the QX4, and with the more-powerful engine, the QX4 should be on your test-drive list.<br><br>
