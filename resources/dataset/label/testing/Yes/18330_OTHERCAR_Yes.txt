            I currently own a 1995 Eclipse GSX.  I have owned the car for nearly two years.  It cost me about $15,500 when I purchased it and it was one of the best investments I ever made.  I did have to spend some money with a few minor problems (about $1000. So, in total I spent about $16,500.  I had  215 horsepower and a real nice looking sports coupe!
I would race M3's, porsche boxter's and beat them all.  The funny part was that they spent $30,000-$50,000 on their cars and I only spent $16,500.
Leather, fully loaded options made the car a confortable ride too.
Basically, it's a combination of a fully loaded japanese car and racing-feeling type engine.
Everyone looks at you like your rolling in style!
I've driven this car about 30,000 miles, all the way from Boston to Montreal in the middle of freezing rain, blizzards, etc. and that's when the all-wheel drive came in handy.
So, all of the sudden you have the best three components in your car:
1)Very fast speed
2)Leather seats/numerous options.
3)All-Wheel Drive that handles almost any kind of terrain!
Basically, these are all the reasons why I think that the GSX Eclipse is sports car, luxury car and SUV all in one!<br><br>
