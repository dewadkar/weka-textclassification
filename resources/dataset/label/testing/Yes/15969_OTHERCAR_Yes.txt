            I'd like to start by saying that this car is absolutely amazing.  Although I don't own this car, my neighbor purchased this car last year, and it is amazing.  I have driven it a few times: the handling is amazing, the engine is amply powerful, and there is plenty of head and foot room.
	To start, the interior is perfectly designed.  The leather seats are firm and comfortable for all lengths of trips.  The dashboard layout puts all useful information in easy view, so you don't have to crain your neck to look how many rpm's you are currently at.  Also, the radio consol is well designed, with most of the options found on table top stereos compressed into the few buttons on the dash.  Also, the seats, headrests, mirrors, windows, are all automated.  The most important thing, however, is that the seats are heated, and option, but it is well worth it if you live in a cold region.
	The exterior is very nice as well.  You can purchase the new high power lights, although I don't remember what they are called, which illuminate the road far better than standard lights.  Also, the shape and design of the E-class is outstanding: Aerodynamic, sleek, and stylish.
	Altogether, the automated interior features, the sleek design, as well as the safety of multiple airbags, this car is a good buy for families who are looking for a long-lasting, dependable car which is affordable. Enjoy!<br><br>
