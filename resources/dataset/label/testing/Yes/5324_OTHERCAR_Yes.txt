            For five years now I have been in love with my vehicle.  I moved from the Honda civic ('95) to the Honda Accord ('98).  I purchased the EX model and have been very pleased, just as I always have been with Honda.  There are very few things I would change about the car, such as the keyless entry not always registering, but I think I could go and get that fixed, I'm not sure.  I like the four door feature, and the back seat is roomy enough to lay across (I am 5'5&quot; and I have plenty of room).  My small dog carrier also fits perfectly in the front or back seat.  Another thing I would change about the car, the main thing, is the way the air blows in the car, in the winter one foot is burning while the other is still cold.  This is not a trait belonging solely to Honda, however, as I have experienced this with several makes and models.  I would recommend this car to anyone who hates driving, because the ride in this car actually makes facing the roadway bearable. <br><br>
