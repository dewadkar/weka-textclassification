            The Jeep Cherokee, compared to most others on the market, seems quite bare inside.  Where are the pushbuttons?  Where are all the levers?  Where are the climate-controlled cupholders with built-in lumbar support for your Pepsi?  

For a solid, dependable vehicle, this is just what you want.  No frills.  The 4 liter engine is very torquey, the mileage is not bad at about 21 mpg, the Jeep is very comfortable to drive in for long periods of time, it tows heavy loads happily, and looks and feels rugged.  I had a four door, two wheel drive version - the insurance is lower without 4 wheel drive.  I drove mine back and forth across the country towing heavy trailers with things piled on the roof.  I took it through Northern Labrador on 600 miles of painful dirt roads.  I even took it through downtown New York City!  It survived all of this without a problem at all.  I was caught in a flood in New York where everyone else in the building was stranded with cars and trucks flooded - my Jeep took lots of people home that day!  After a hurricane, I was the one to make runs to the stores over the downed branches, trees, and floods.  In the winter, my Jeep was the one to take everyone out to eat - even though it was 2WD, it seemed to know of its heritage and stay on the road without skidding.  

The Jeep Cherokee is truly a well-made vehicle.  The only special treatment I gave mine were regular oil changes and keep it full of gas.  

I highly recommend a Jeep for anyone who can do without 200 cupholders within reach, and people who want a serious vehicle, not a frilly one.  An added bonus is that Jeeps are extremely easy to modify and customize, and there are plenty of aftermarket companies designing products specifically for these Jeeps.<br><br>
