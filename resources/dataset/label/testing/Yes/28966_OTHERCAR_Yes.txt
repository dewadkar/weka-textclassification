            After looking into SEVERAL different vehicle options I found myself at the Hyundai dealers taking a quick test drive of the Ellantra. The Ellantra is a nice looking car but when I brought my husband back with me to test drive it, the Sonata caught his eye. One of the cars that we were looking at was the Oldsmobile Alero. I love the look of the car but it is much more pricey and not nearly as safe as the Hyundai cars. As a matter of fact, we were about ready to sign on the dotted lines to buy the Alero when I decided to take a quick gander at the Hyundais - expecting them to look &quot;cheap&quot;. Well, this visit to the dealership prompted me to ditch the idea of the Alero because I was noticiing that I could get more bang for my buck in a lower priced automobile. Our search continued on to the Pontiac Sunfire (cute on the outside but very unsafe) and the Cavalier (kind of cheap looking to me and not as safe) so we could compare cars that were in the same price range as the Ellantra. 

The Sonata is a step up from the Ellantra - a little bigger and a little more expensive - but it is a great car for the money. We got a loaded Sonata (CD, sunroof, etc.) but didn't opt for the V6 as we used that (and the color) as leverage with the dealer for buying one off the lot. We definitely got more for our money with the Sonata. We extended the 10-year tram warranty to a 10-year bumper to bumper for around $20 extra per month. If I had known that it was an option I would have negotiated that into the car price. Anyway, it is well worth it to know that 99,999 miles from now I will be able to take the car in for a FREE repair! (especially with an electric sunroof and power windows/locks). 

I am happy with the customer service and the gas mileage is what they claim it to be (not any better!). The back seat is roomy and ready for some long legged friends unlike the Ellantra and Sunfire and Alero and Cavalier. We're very happy with the purchase! 

I have to be honest though and report that 1 week after we had our car, the check engine light came on. It was checked out by the dealership (they picked it up and dropped it off at work for me) and they replaced a defective part for free, of course - something about oxygen in exhaust - an environmental thing. It's been great ever since. I've already put almost 5000 miles on it in 2 months it is doing great! 

Also, I don't recommend opting for the keyless entry. It is not standard and you will pay extra. Ours was &quot;thrown in&quot; (yeah right :)) and it only locks and unlocks the doors - no trunk action or panic button. If I had known this, I would have negotiated for at least the trunk opener. If you add your own on later, I imagine it is more costly and if you don't do it through Hyundai I imagine it is not covered. So, if this is something you are interested in - ask the right questions.

I love my car! It's a great quiet ride in the morning!

UPDATE: I wrote this review in 2000 and I recently traded in the Sonata. I have to say, nothing had really gone wrong with the car when we traded it in but I was starting to have doubts with how well they would honor the warranty.At 60,000 we replaced the timing belt which was costly ($500)and I'm not even sure how much they needed to be done. The maintenance costs were getting quite out of control and if I took it to anyone else BUT a hyundai dealership they basically would have an excuse to not back up the warranty if anything went wrong. That's where they are making the money. A few small things did go wrong along the 60,000 miles I drove it and they were fixed for free under the warranty. This is just a word of warning that you make sure that you take a serious look at the maintenance costs on these vehicles. I haven't done homework yet on comparing those costs to others but it gets pretty pricey after awhile... And if they aren't going to honor their warranty then what is the point of having it?!

Case in point, they were going to charge me over $300 for something that a local mechanic did for $75 but since he didn't replace the spark plugs with Hyundai spark plugs, if something went wrong it wouldn't be covered.
