            We owned a red Ford Escort LX ('91) for many years, and recently moved across country, leaving the car with my parents.  We are VERY sad not to have it any more, it was a great, reliable car with much character.  It rarely if ever had problems, and didn't burn an ounce of oil, and I can attest to the fact that it started in very cold weather, one morning when the thermometer said 37 below even!!!  Its only drawbacks were it was sort of rattly, and the back door handle broke, so it could only be opened from the inside.  It would have cost more to fix than the car was worth, so we just dealt with it, and would have kept doing so if we hadn't moved.  It certainly would have made the trip but I felt my father needed it more than we did, after his dealing with a series of junkers.  I would and have recommended the '91 and beyond Ford Escort to many.
