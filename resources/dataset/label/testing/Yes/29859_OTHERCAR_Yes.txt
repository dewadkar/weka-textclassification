            First things first, this camera will deliver great digital pictures, not the equal of a 35mm SLR, but better than you'll need for putting on the web, and great for recording works in progress (a building, a painting, a garden...)

A couple of notes: 

I use the USB transfer with an IBM thinkpad, easy set-up, no glitches, pretty quick transfer. After you've downloaded the pix, remember to delete them from the camera, to free up space.

Batteries - this thing will eat alkaline batteries, keep the lithiums ready to go, and if you don't have an extra set, keep a 4 or 8 pack of brand new alkalines for emergency use.

Design issues: 

the lens should be threaded for adapters/filters, slip-on attachments are fine for cheap cameras, but the 265 is capable of so much better images, that it should be accorded the best optical accessories.

The LCD screen cover is a flexible plastic, it works ok, but should be a more rigid sheet of Lexan (SA-R for those of you into Lexan), would give a much greater impression of integrity.

The shutter release button (is that what you still call it on a digital camera?) should be a little more generous. Note to Kodak engineers: go out and try a Nikon N90/F100/F5, that's what the grip should feel like and that's what the shutter release should look &amp; feel like. 

All in all, surprised me with the quality of the images, pretty easy to use, a little more work on the industrial design, and I'd give it 5 stars.

For now: 4 of 5, not a bad effort
