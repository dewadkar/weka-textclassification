                 In 1991 I required a new minivan to replace the old worn out Honda wagon.  After much shopping around I finally settled on the Mazda MPV due to the reasonable price and car like driving.  Without even a break in period, the van had its first test: the road trip.  The first road trip, as well as many others (some spanning over 1000 miles) always went off without a hitch.  Never was there a mechanical problem as there was with the Honda wagon.   

     After 8 long years of service, and over 300,000 miles of travel the vehicle is still running just as well as it was in its prime, other than a nonfunctional air conditioner, which broke due to an incompetent mechanic.  Of all minivans I've ever driven the MPV still handles most like a normal car.  Also, never during its service did the MPV have trouble comfortably holding seven, almost grown up, teenagers on their way too and from a concert.

     If I had a reason to purchase another minivan, it would be an MPV.  It has been more reliable than any other car I've ever driven and was actually fun to drive.  So when you're next looking for a van to hold the kids drop by the local Mazda dealer and check out the MPV.b<br><br>
