              My beloved '87 Jetta had finally given up the ghost -- 5th gear had taken leave of it's usual place and was mingling freely among the other four.  I needed a new car and needed it *now*.  

  I had spent a while shopping around, mostly looking at mid-to late-90's cars priced around $8000-$10000 -- lots of Saturn sedans and Honda Civics.  During my search, I encountered an ad for a local dealership, advertising a clearance sale on used inventory -- I stopped by, expecting to find a plethora of former rental cars and what-not.  Everything there was marked with a 'monthly payments' tag, and most of the cars were the expected Buick/Taurus ex-rentals.

  Peeking out from among those cars, however, was a blindingly white 2000 Focus hatchback -- I took notice of the manual transmission (sweet!), and had read a number of very favorable reviews of the car -- it had been named Car of the Year by Automobile magazine and Car and Driver had named it to their 10 Best list 2 years in a row, so I looked closer, and found that it was very much in the price range I was looking for -- additionally, it only had 20000 miles on it.  People will either love or hate the car's styling -- the rest of this review is useless to the latter.  Fortunately, I fall into the first category, and this review is aimed at those people, in addition to the few people that are still undecided about the car's looks.  

  I took it for a test drive and was duly impressed -- the Focus makes a fabulous first impression, even when it's a year and a half old.  The interior is novel and different without being pretentious or sacrificing ergonomics -- everything is where you expect it to be, and the controls move with the smoothness and fluidity you'd normally associate with a much more expensive car.  The plastics are also of a higher grade than you're used to finding in cars in the price range, and there's nary a mold parting line or exposed screw to be seen.

  The seating position is high, making entry and exit very easy, along with providing the driver with an excellent view outwards.  The front seats themselves are very comfortable and relatively firm, providing good thigh and back support.  The side bolsters are relatively small, but the seating surfaces are covered in a grippy fabric that helps to keep you in place during more aggressive driving.  Room in all directions is very good, and the cabin as a whole is spacious and airy -- lots of glass and enough space to make passengers remark on how wide the car seems.  The back seats provide good space for two adults, but will accommodate three in a pinch. (not quite literally, but close)  The cargo area is what you'd expect from a hatchback -- big, and it can get bigger, with a flat load floor and easy access through the hatch.  The seatbacks fold down and are split 60/40, but to extend the flat floor, you need to fold the entire rear seat bottom forward.  Odd. 

  The driving experience is worlds better than one would expect from a $13000 car, and humbles all of it's direct competition.  The Focus strikes a near-perfect balance between ride and handling, seemingly making no compromises to either.  The ride is well-controlled, with bumps registering only audibly in most cases, not unlike pricey European sports sedans.  Larger bumps are tightly suppressed, with the car settling immediately afterwards.  

  The car's handling is equally impressive -- in turns, the body rolls some, but then 'digs in' and refuses to roll any more, instead giving way to gentle, progressive understeer which can be coaxed into a tail-out attitude if you want.  The Focus is a ton of fun on tight, winding back roads.  Major controls are near perfect, with only a slightly notchy shifter detracting from the experience.  The brakes are a touch sensitive, but you adjust easily.  Otherwise, the pedal feel and responses are almost perfectly linear.  After driving the Focus, other cars' brakes seem numb and lifeless.  As for the steering:

  Best.  Steering.  Ever.

  Perfectly weighted, with a strong on-center feeling.  Effort builds naturally, and the wheel telegraphs what's happening without kicking back.  I can't say enough about it, other than to say you *have* to try it before you think about buying anything else.  Truly a marvel.

  The engine is the 130-hp 2.0 liter Zetec unit, which has been derided for being thrashy at the limit in the automotive press.  I can't say I agree with that assessment, and can only say this:  I can't tell it's on at idle without looking at the tach, I can barely hear it in routine driving, and I like the growly noises it makes when it's pressed.  Power is good, but the excellent chassis is definitely not going to be overwhelmed.  The gearing seems short, as the car squirts in and out of traffic with ease and pulls off the line smartly.

  Overall build quality is excellent -- not quite at the level of Audi/VW in terms of fit and finish, but much better than you'd expect from the former purveyor of Escorts.  The car itself feels very 'of a piece' and has yet to develop any squeaks, rattles or untoward noises.  Additionally, the panel fits are very uniform, both inside and out.

  If you're in the market for a sporty small car, you'd be very hard-pressed to do better than the Focus.  The overall level of sophistication,  especially of the chassis, are unmatched at this price point.  You'd probably be pretty hard-pressed to do better looking at cars costing many thousands of dollars more.  Unqualified recommendation.
