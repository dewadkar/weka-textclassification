            My wife and I are the living embodiment of the adage: &quot;opposites attract:&quot;  she's a hard-bitten trial lawyer and I a fuzzy-headed Liberal Arts academic.  With respect to most purchases we are as diametric as possible--we even have to have two brands of catsup (or ketchup as she spells it).  However, when it came to purchasing a car, we passed on the Camry (it's made of vanilla, I swear, it's so bland) and the Accord (when did it SHRINK?) to get a 1999 Passat GLS 4-cyl turbo with Tiptronic and not much else in the way of extras.  The perky lil puppy scamped around like a spots car and was as nimble as my neighbor's $30,000+ Audi A-4,  (I later found out why--they share many components) and for about $22K after dealing.  Although a lead foot like my wife's will crank down the mileage to about 18.5mi/gal (on PREMIUM, no less! It won't take anything else.) I could squeeze about 23mi/gal and still run with the other dogs.  And, the standard features (keyless entry, security, radio/stereo, ABS and traction control, fogs) coupled with the precise fit and finish, made me feel like I was driving something much more expensive.  My only real complaint:  turbo lag.  It REALLY bothered my wife.

That was last Faebruary.  Last week my wife and I, having received some windfall cash, bought TWO NEW 2000 Passats!  We took very little beating on the 1999, and now have a GLS V-6 Tiptronic and a GLS 4-Cyl, both with toys galore. I have the 5-speed turbo (no lag now) and she has the V-6.  We couldn't be happier.  Although hers is stronger, mine, with the lighter engine, is a bit more nimble.  She could take me in a road race, but I'd have the track to myself (I drove in SCCA races years ago).  If you're looking for a reasonably inexpensive expensive-looking-and-acting car, this is one to include on your Must Drive list.<br><br>
