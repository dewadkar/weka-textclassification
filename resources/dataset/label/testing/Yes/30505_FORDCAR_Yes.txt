            My Dad has a 1999 Ford F-350 Super Duty truck.  Grey interior, CD player, bedliner, 7.3 Liter Diesel, Black with gray two tone.  Oh sorry, I guess I caught myself dreaming there for a second.  Well, i can't really blame myself, nor should you.  The Ford line of trucks are amazing.  They pack more punch per dollar than Dodge and Chevy.  Not only have ford trucks been the pick of most people buying a truck, they have out-sold Dodge and Chevy combined.  I guess I'm not the only one dreaming.  The Ford has always had enough power for anything we've ever had to do.  Wether it's going for groceries, or hauling 8-10 full grown cattle to auction, it's always been reliable.<br><br>
