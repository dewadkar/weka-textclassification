            What is the first thing you think of when you hear Buick?  Well, forget it.  The new Buick is not like the old Buick.

When I heard I was getting a Buick Regal GS for the week, I was less than thrilled. Sure the GS sounded interesting, but still not thrilling.  When I actually drove the car, my whole mind-set changed. Would you believe a Buick that is fun to drive and, dare I say, sporty?  Well it's true.

Under the hood lies a supercharged 3.8L V-6 which produces 240hp. That is 40 more than the Camry and about 20hp more than the Maxima. This car goes. When passing it will set you back in your seat. The exhaust growl is rather pleasant as well. What the engine lacks in smoothness or sophistication, it more than makes up for in pure power.  The 4 speed automatic shifts smoothly in both performance and standard modes.  

Inside the Regal GS are probably the most comfortable seats you will find in any car under $30,000.  Frankly they are more comfortable than many cars over $30,000. The semi-circle gauges are well placed and have a decidedly sporty look.  The Monsoon stereo sounds great.  All stereo knobs and buttons are easy to use but lack the ergonomic perfection found in some Japanese cars.  The optional steering wheel mounted radio controls are great.  Seating up front is roomy. Lots of head room. I am 6'1&quot; and can wear a hat even in a car equipped with a sunroof.  Rear seats have less room.  My feeling is that the large trunk takes away from what could be more rear seat room. 

The ride is firm, but not harsh.  Handling is very nimble and precise. I found myself saying &quot;this is a Buick?&quot; many times. The one drawback is the amount of road noise that gets into the cabin. It's not bad, but a little more than one would expect.

The great thing about this car is the long list of standard and optional equipment.  With almost every option the car still comes in at just around  $27K.
For that price you will get: 

Supercharged 240hp V-6
cornering lights
Monsoon stereo w/ CD
16&quot; chrome wheels
sunroof/ moonroof
leather
traction control
4-wheel disc brakes with ABS
Climate control
Keyless entry
Driving lights
The list goes on. Some of these things you can't even get on a Camry or Accord, even if you do want to pay more. 

All this and clean, contemporary styling.  Buick has truly changed.<br><br>
