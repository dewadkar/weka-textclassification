            I was 7 months pregnant and looking for a used family vehicle that was not a mini van.  I didn't want to fit the typical stereotype, that once you started having kids you needed a mini van to be comfortable and for there to be enough room to take everything but the kitchen sink when you had to go uptown for some diapers.

I drove by the Mazda dealership everyday on my way to work and noticed this white mid-size car sitting out front.  We finally decided to go take a look.  I think my biggest fear was what the price would be.  I just automatically assumed that Mazda's were going to be too expensive.

As soon as I sat in the drivers seat and started up the car I was hooked.  It was not too big, it was definitely not too small and it drove like a dream.  It is a 5 speed, standard transmission, 1993 with 90,000 miles.  It is a four door, everything standard in it, nothing is automatic.  The only thing that I asked to be added was air conditioning, due to my condition and the terrible heat that summer.  The price was not as expensive as I had originally anticipated, even after adding the air conditioning. 

My son is now 2 years old and I wouldn't even dream of trading in this gem of a car.  We are trying to have our next child and we know that there is plenty of room for two children and all of the baggage that we must take with us for them on a road trip.  I have also put about 25,000 miles on the car and I can honestly say that I have never had any major repairs on the car only standard maintenance.

If ever our Mazda 626 can no longer perform its family duties I will most definitely be looking for another Mazda to take its place.<br><br>
