            Let's skip the statistical data on this car; you can read that anywhere.  Instead, I mean to present the real deal on life with this beautifully sculpted machine. 
Allow me to introduce myself:  I am an owner of a 2000 GTi GLX and have been since August, 1999.  In the nine months I've been driving this car, it has taken me to and from work countless times, made several road trips, and even helped me move across town.  I have racked up nearly 15,000 miles on her, added some common accessories, and made a few minor modifications.  Its been great and no car has ever been able to adapt to so many driving situations so gracefully as this one does.

What follows may be more than you care to read so I'll produce the summary first:  I have here a car that is as reliable as a Honda, accelerates like a Mustang GT, has the luxury appointments of a Lexus, handles like a 3 series BMW, can carry a washing machine with ease, and has the engineering sophistication you can only get in a German automobile.  I have reached motoring nirvana.

the routine....
Everyday I drive through moderate in-town traffic to and from work.  The highlight here is the engine:  the torque-monster known as VR6.  Starts from those pesky traffic lights are on-par with GT mustangs and the wide powerband affords me the rolling acceleration to slip underneath yellow lights with ease and to squirt around the slower-moving commoners without having to put down my coffee cup and ratchet the shifter through the gears.  The car's extensive standard equipment list makes my driving life so pleasant.  All winter long, I never once had to wipe dry my side mirrors or have to deal with ice-clogged windshield washer nozzles and my buns enjoyed many a toasting o'er those heated leather seats.  Rain sensing windshiled wipers are every bit as cool as they sound and were first employed on the trip home from the dealership.  On the subject of cool, top honors is a toss-up between the multi-light headlamp assemblies and the radiant blue instrument lighting.

My first roadtrip took me from the home-office in Eastern North Carolina, round trip to Dallas, TX with my girlfriend and her 10-year-old.  The near 2500 mile trip was a breeze and highlighted the quietness, smoothness, and high-speed capabilities of the GTi.  (I owned a Honda Prelude Si before the VW and can tell you that a trip with 3 onboard would have been sheer misery.  Also,while the Prelude is normally a rather civil machine, it does lose all its composure at high speeds;  a problem not shared by the GTi.)  It also demonstrates the car's ability to take a 'family' and all their luggage on a vacation.

Road trip 2...Destination Miami, FL.  Notable about this trip was that my girlfriend and I saw well over 100 Porsche boxsters in and around Miami but only 2 Mark-4 GTi's (including ours).  Here I discovered that with so much torque being generated by the VR6, you can't tell the difference in power output when the A/C's on and it still turned highway mileage figures around 28 mpg.

Trip 3 was to the Florida panhandle (1400 round trip).  I went on business and would be gone nearly 2 months.  I brought with me plenty to keep myself entertained while away from home for so long including: a kayak, a Trek mountain bike, my Dell PC, a guitar, playstation, a suitcase full of clothes, a 2 cubic foot box full of reference books, 20 CD's, 3 bags of groceries, and my 240 pound associate and HIS bags!!  Try that with your Mustang, Camaro, Neon, or Civic.

What of that move across town??  I mostly moved via a Ryder 24 footer.  But when a great deal on a used Maytag came up after I had returned the van, the VW was there.  Rear seats folded down, the washer slipped right in and I was able to close the rear hatch!

Accessories added include a Thule rack system which carries my kayak to the coast and a black vinyl 'bra' to protect the front end during high speed highway runs.  The dealer's 6-disc changer resides in the factory-installed changer mount and plays beautiful music through the Monsoon stereo system that comes standard with the GLX.

I do (or did) have one gripe with the car.  As is from the dealer's lot, I found the suspension to be too soft for a 'sport' model which the GTi is.  (sport version of the Golf)  Not to worry, though, as VW sells through its dealerships a sport spring package co-engineered with Eibach that shifts the car's suspension more towards the firm.  I had this kit installed in December, 1999.  The improvement in cornering, braking, and general road manners far outweighs the increase in ride stiffness.

I've been reading where a lot of people are whining about the size of the back seat.  Look, this is not a stationwagon or a minivan.  It is a compact.  As such, it may have one of the roomiest backseats in its class.  It definitely has one of the leatheriest.  I'm 5' 9&quot; and have no issues with riding in the back as I did for a few hundred miles returning from the Dallas excursion.

With the exception of the original springs, Volkswagen really nailed it with this Fourth generation of the GTi.  

Bravo.
