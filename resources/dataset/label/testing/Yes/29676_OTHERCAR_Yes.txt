            This is my wife's car, and we were looking for a good used Accord, when she saw a 2000 Regal on the lot.  A test drive had her convinced and I was resigned -- I like Accords.  My 30-something son was appalled.  "Dad, you are not so old that you need to be driving Buicks".  I agreed with him.  Man, was I surprised.  

After a couple of months of owning this car, I have to change my mind about Buicks.  This car is hot!  Besides the impressive acceleration and clean handling, which I didn't expect, the ride is very comfortable, which I did expect.  However, the biggest and best surprise is the gas mileage --- 23 mpg city driving, and 30 mpg on the road.  Our city driving is 30 mph stop and go, and the road mileage is a cruise control setting of 70.  The overdrive transmission is geared for well over 200 mph, but I understand there is a governor just over 100 mph.  I didn't test it.

This car is full of gadgets and do-dads that my Accords didn't have, nor my Tahoe.  For instance, the excellent sounding stereo doesn't turn off when you shut down the engine.  It waits until you shut down AND open the door.  Side mounted headlights come on with the turn signals and there are warning lights if your tire pressures are not close to being equal.  Maybe Buick has had these gadgets for years, but this is our first Buick.  It probably won't be our last.  

My only complaint is the small mirrors.  I'm certain larger ones would not fit the lines of the car the designers like, but I would like a better view behind me in traffic.  I'll learn to adjust.  Good job, Buick.
