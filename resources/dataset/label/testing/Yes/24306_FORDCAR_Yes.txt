            I leased my Escort as a brand new model year car in April 1994.  After the 3 years was up I decided to buy it out, it was such a good car.  I should note that I still own and drive this car every single day, but the total mileage on it (almost 9 years later) is very low...not yet 50,000 kms.  I work and shop and do business very close to home and live in a relatively small city.  It has been on a few long drives (up to 8 hours), once or twice per year.

The "sports package" happened to be what they had in stock, not something I ordered specifically.  Basically it means an RPM gauge (and a slightly different dashboard configuration) and a fake spoiler on the back.

Mileage:  The mileage has been most impressive, although it is a small car with only 4 cylanders and low gas consumption is almost assumed.  Obviously I see better savings on long highway type trips than in stop and go traffic in the city.  Overall I am pleased with the fuel economy.

Comfort and size considerations:  I use this car mainly to get myself to and from places.  As far as driver comfort and workings as a single person automobile it is wonderful.  The front seat provides ample room and the dashboard fittings for the most part are logical and easy to access and use while driving.  While my model has automatic mirror adjusting (very useful because you can adjust both sideview mirrors while driving from the driver's seat), it did not come with power windows or locks.  

Being a two door model, only the driver and passenger windows open in the front seat - the back seat windows are fixed.  The window cranks are relatively easy to turn and have not been a liability, although you can tell the passenger side window is used less often and is stiffer to turn.  Manual locks have also not been a liability since I can easily reach the passenger side lock if needed without too much effort.

The back seat is roomy for an economy sized car, but may be too cramped for people with long legs.  Also since it is a 2 door model, large and tall people may find it difficult to climb in and out of the back seat (deep floor well and awkward front seat seatbelt placement).  My 3 year old daughter has little trouble getting in and out, with me holding her hand while she climbs over the edge of the seat well.  I have to climb in the back to latch her carseat and now seatbelt, but that may be an issue in any 2 door car when using the back seat regularly.

The back seat also has a 60/40 split to make the trunk larger if needed.  This does come in handy, as the back including the hatch area is larger than one might think.  I have slept 2 adults comfortably in the back with the seat down and the front seats moved up.  Other than being in plain view through the slanted hatch window, that is - tee hee!

The hatch area has a "cover" that hangs from the hatch itself, so that when it is closed it looks very much like a regular trunk through the back window.  This is nice to keep the sun off your groceries and hides valuables from view (during Christmas shopping, for example).  It lifts up and out of the way automatically when you open the hatch.  If you want to put taller items back there, this cover has to come off.  The only complaint here?  It's a stiff plastic material covered in carpet fibres and is hard to store when removed.

The overall size of the car is small, although it seems tall for the height and width.  I like the fact that I can see clearly to the front and back bumpers and from side to side with no trouble.  I haven't noticed any horrendous blind spots..to the contrary this car seems to be all window.  When there is a tall passenger it can make it harder to see on that side of the car, but that may be normal.  Like I said, I am used to driving by myself most of the time, or with me in the front and my child in the back.

As far as under the hood, resevoirs for such things as coolant and windshield wiper fluid are plainly marked and relatively easy to get at.  I can never refill these without spilling so I keep small funnels for each, but this could be a personal problem.  The oil dipper can be a little harder to find and get to, and my bigger problem is getting it back IN there after checking it.  I just get my oil changed regularly to avoid having to check it!  There is also an emergency fuel shut off, accessible in the hatch area.

The Colours:  The paint itself looks like an underlay of deep colour and a clear coating, although I believe it is a "finish" rather than a colour and a coating.  Cayman green it is called, and still looks as nice as when I bought it.  I have to confess, this car has only been washed TWICE in all these years and it never looks dirty.  Rainwater alone keeps it pretty spiffy I must say.  And though I am in a high-winter-road-salt area, there is not a spot of rust on this car.  Of course, for the first two years it was parked indoors so that might explain partly.  The interior is gray, with sort of a pattern on the seats (gray being the largest component).  The upholstery has kept nice and bright though I have never cleaned it and truthfully, make no effort to keep it clean!

Some things I should mention:

1.  My husband, usually a passenger in my car, complains that there is no armrest between the front seats.  I don't notice this while driving, but then again I tend to rest my hand on the floor mounted gear handle (even though my model is automatic).

2.  There is no hatch release lever inside the car.  This can be inconvenient because the car must be turned off and the key used to open the trunk when loading or unloading items.  Of course, one can always get an additional key if that is an issue.

3.  The fuel door is not locking, so there is no release inside the car.  It is frightfully stiff to open, however.  Many times fuel clerks have snidely asked me to "pop the tank" after pulling on it for a few minutes without luck.  I have to say "pull really hard, it doesn't lock".  After this length of time it hasn't loosened at all.

4.  Most of the repairs have been expected as wear and tear (brake pads, exhaust system, that sort of thing).  But I had one major repair (air sensor) due to the low mileage.  It was suggested if I drove the car for longer distances this would not have been a problem.

5.  The rims.  Sigh.  Off and on I had trouble with the tires losing air.  I would arrive at a store with four inflated tires and come out to one, two, or four flat ones.  Yet no matter how many times I had them checked THE TIRES WERE FINE.  It took years of this ocassional problem to finally find out that faulty rims could cause this.  I had the rims replaced and have had no trouble since.  Since I had the car for so long I have no idea if it was just my car and my driving conditions or a problem with this car in general.

6.  The gas gauge.  I find that it is accurate until the car reaches a half tank.  Then the next time I start the car, the gauge says 1/4 tank and stays there.  Until it is completely empty, at which time I run out of gas and the car stops running.  And when I attempt to restart it coughs and gags and the gauge drops down to E.  This seems like a major issue, doesn't it?  Well, after running out of gas once or twice in the first year I had it (and having the float replaced and bringing it in several times to no real effect) I developed my own system.  When I can, I top it up to keep it over half a tank of gas.  That is not always possible.  So every single time I put gas in my tank (and usually that is 10.00 CDN at a time) I hit my "trip reset" button.  When it hits above 200 (winter or when gas prices are high) but before 400 (summer and when gas prices are low) I know it is time to put more gas in.

7.  While the rear defrost works very well and is quick, the windshield defrost is not so hot.  I think it might be a power management thing, but there doesn't seem to be any heat generated from the heater unless you are actually driving (meaning touching the gas).  I can let the car warm up for an hour and actually get more heat in 5 minutes of driving.  So I scrape the windshield and windows and bundle up.  No complaints regarding the air conditioning, which is fast and cools well right into the back seat.

8.  Since I tend to drive with the sun shield down, the sun has ruined the fabric on that side to the point where it has become dry and flakes off.  I just noticed this.  If you drive with it down, remember to put it back when you park the car.  I haven't decided whether to have it replaced or fixed or what at this point.

All in all this has been a good little car that has serviced me well, and hopefully will continue to do so for a few more years!  And who says a little escort isn't a cool car?  Vroom vroom!
