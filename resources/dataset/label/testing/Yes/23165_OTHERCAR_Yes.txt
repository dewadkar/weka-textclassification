            I chose to test-drive this 2001 Infiniti Q45 for two important reasons:  It comes equipped not only with driver's and passenger's airbag, but also with side-impact air bag.  To me, head protection in any new cars should have these features.  Infiniti understands that the owners of these cars, in case of any accidents need their head to continue thinking and paying the bills.  Doesn't this make sense?  After all, the technolgy has been around for quite a while.  Even though the manufacturers are not going to get any credit for installing it, new owners will owe their life to its existence onboard.  Enough of my obsession with safety issues!

On a foggy afternoon, a good friend of mine whose wife just bought this 2001 decided to take it for a spin around two neighborhoods.  Yeah!  Female consumerist power!  We decided to kill two birds with one stone.  My friend was in the process of looking for a new home in a well-respected area.  Having set the temperature to a comfortable level and put in a CD, we were ready to explore the area.  At first, I thought my head would touch the ceiling.  It did not after all.  After sliding the seat back a bit, I sat down comfortably behind the steering wheel.  And I was ready to feel the Q45.  Ah!  What a ride it was!  I did not have to look for any homes.  I was more into making comments about how smooth the car rides.  There was no noise.  It was a complete ride.  

<b>A definite head-turner</b>

Since it was foggy, we kept the frog light on.  We had to cross Freeway 99 to hit the other side of the area where my friend expected to find a decent home.  I wondered why he did not want to go with a realtor.  Any way, the 4.1L 8 Cylinder 266 hp Q45 was kind of a vanilla color.  It was shining on the freeway.  Trying to impress me with some of the car's features, my friend reached over and pretended he was looking for directions or some kind of map.  Great navigational system!  We could not get lost in this small neighborhood.  The interior is superb.  And so is the trunk.  Actually, you can store and carry as many pieces of luggage as you want in it.  

After a few hours, we decided to head back home.  In front of the garage, we stopped and continued to check the hood and the exterior of the vehicle.  Then, we digressed to guys' talk for a while as we leaned against the vehicle.

Just imagine for an instant all the standard features plus all the additional options of the Q45!

If you are on the market for a new vehicle, a luxurious one, the Q45 may be the one that not only matches your wallet size, but also fits well with your ego and status.
