            My husband bought this digital camera for me for Valentines day. I just love it. I am just one of those that is bad at bringing my film in to the store to be developed."grin" So this one works very nice.

I have 3 kids that I love to take pictures of and most of my family live out of town. So this is very easy to take the pictures and upload them to my computer and just send to them. I love it and they love it because they get to see the kids more. 

The camera is a silver color with a 1.75 inch LCD screen on the back so you can see the pictures you are taking. You can also turn that off so it don't use up so much batteries. I went out and bought the rechargeable ones. Those work great. 

The camera is a 2.31 MP this has a 8 MB memory right inside it so you do not have to go out and buy the memory card right away for it.This has a 3 star setting on the quality of pictures you take with the 3 star the best. This will hold 7 pictures the 2 star holds 16 and the 1 star holds 113 pictures in the memory. I do have to say the 1 star is of good quality pictures. They print out just fine on the printer. 

There is a 2x digital zoom. and also a great feature for me is the self timer which goes for 10 seconds. you have 4 settings. Red eye, flash on, flash off and auto flash.

On the top of the camera is the 3 little buttons which are your star level the 2x zoom and timer and the flash. next to that is a little screen that tells you which star level you have it on how many pictures you have left and the flash mode you have it on. There is also a battery that tells you how much is left or used. Also there is the shinny silver button you push to take the pictures and the on/off slid button to turn the camera on and off.

 There is also a little turning wheel towards the back of the top camera. That is for the LCD screen. You can push down on it and it will bring up a picture and you can turn that to either flip thru the pictures you have take. You push down you get a selection screen on the LCD screen to either delete the pictures,print,view the thumbnails which is to see all the pictures you have taken,magnify your setup and exit.

When the camera is on there is a little green light on it that will come on it is right next to your view window which you can use if you do not want to have the LCD screen on. There is a button on the back by the LCD screen that will also turn the screen on or off.

On the right side is the door where you can put your extra memory in that slot and also where you hook up your USB cable so you can upload them to your computer. And there is a little black wrist strap to carry it around.

At the bottom of the camera is the door where you put your batteries which are 4 AA. and looks like a hook up to set it on a tripod. This camera came with the first set of batteries right in the box. That was nice. A user guide very easy to understand and use. CD with the photo imagining software. when you plug your camera into the computer and turn it on the program will come right up so you can upload your pictures without searching for the icon.

The camera is compatible with Windows and Macintosh. And yes even the new window xp which I have. I know some programs will not work with the new XP. This one works great. 

Now the computer part. When you upload it comes right up. All you do is either push start upload and it will put it in its own folder in your pictures folder. But what I do is select none so it just goes into my pictures. Too many extra folders. It then will show you how many pictures are goanna be uploaded to the computer and then when done it will tell you how many you have uploaded to your computer and how many you just did. Just push finish and then it will bring up the folder with the pictures in it.

If you go in and double click on a picture it brings up a screen with lots to do on it. You can then go thru a slide show of all your pictures you have in your folder, you can delete pictures, size them,enhance them print them send them and the options button that brings up your selections on the viewer slideshow,display,filing and a misc.

I just love my HP Photosmart 318 Digital Camera. I have taken more pictures then I think I have in the past 3 years with this one. It has awesome quality. To print the pictures they come out great. Which is another reason why we wanted it. I say this is a good 1st camera. If you are looking for good quality when you print the 2.31MP are great for that. I think that is the lowest MP you should go to get good quality while printing out pictures. And while you shoot I like to not have those nice blurs you get.. Not more Blurs. you can choose what you want to keep.

And I think for the cost of 289.99 it is great. A must have. But remember you must have a computer. Other wise I think it would not be good. "grin" I just had to say that because I have had people ask. 

I have went out and got a 64MB for it and a nice little case. And those rechargeable batteries which I think last a bit longer then the regular.
