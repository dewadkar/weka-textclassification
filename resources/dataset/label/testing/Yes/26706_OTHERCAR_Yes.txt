            Hi, everyone!  I purchased an Olympus D-360L digital camera about two months ago and have been very pleased with this product.  I am not a big photography buff and did not wish to spend a lot of money on a new camera.  For less than $300.00, the Olympus D-360L is a great bargain for an entry level digital camera in terms of quality and features.

I will not go into the details of the camera's operational features, installing the software, etc. You can read great descriptions in other Epinions about this product.  I just want to second the motion of those that "highly recommend" this product.  The camera is easy to use, but I would highly recommend you read the instructions and keep them handy.  The camera also has some nice features without being overloaded with all of the bells and whistles of more expensive models.  I personally do not use the software that came with the camera; the Adobe software that I already have on my PC is quite acceptable for editing photos.  The camera's reliability seems fine for the two months that I have used this product.

The Olympus D-360L is a bargain-priced entry-level digital camera for personal and, in some cases, work use.  I do a modest amount of selling and purchasing collectibles on eBay just as an extension of a very enjoyable hobby. The Olympus D-360L has allowed me to add pictures to the narrative section of my auction sales descriptions and, in my opinion, has greatly enhanced the presentation of my auction items. "A picture is worth a thousand words!"  The value added to my auction items is well worth the relatively low cost of the camera.

As mentioned in other Epinion entries, the camera eats batteries, especially if you use the LCD display or take a lot of flash pictures.  If you take close-ups of indoor objects (for internet auction pictures, for example) or if you want to review your pictures by displaying them on the LCD monitor, I would strongly suggest that you purchase an optional AC adaptor to save on batteries.  Also, if you plan to view and store your pictures on your PC, I have found that the purchase of the optional SmartMedia Card Adaptor makes accessing and downloading the pictures a breeze.

For me, the Olympus D-360L has been a great bargain that has added an exciting new dimension to personal picture-taking and to my internet auction activities.  It is a great entry-level digital camera.
