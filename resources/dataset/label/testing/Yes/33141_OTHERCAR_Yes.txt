            The Chevy Malibu, is a well built car, from the saftey features to the customer comfort features, Chevy has done an excellent job on this vehicle.  Upon walking in to Bill Heard in Nashville my salesman and I were friends from long ago, so when I seen Ron I asked him to get me into a vehicle that is sporty and safe, and without hesitation he suggested a Chevy Malibu.  Now I was skeptical at first thinking that the Malibu was a small car, maybe a little larger than a Metro.  Boy was I wrong, upon taking a test drive of this vehicle I was amazed as to the room of the interior of the car, the handing was excellent, the craftsmanship was superb and it was sporty.  Not only that everything was in reach, cup holders, armrest, radio, lights, etc.

When we got back to the dealership I was wanting to see more of the Malibu so I climbed into the trunk, now I am by no means a small man, so needless to say if it fit my big rear end in the trunk it was big enough.  But seriously it was a lot larger than I thought.  I asked Ron, my salesman (friend) why did he recommend the Malibu, he said he owned one and showed me his, so needless to say I trust him on this one.  I have owned the car for 3 months now and have had -0- problems with it, I just wish I got one sooner.
