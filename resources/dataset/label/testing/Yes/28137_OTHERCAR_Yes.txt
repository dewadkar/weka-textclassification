            The Polaroid PDC-700 is a good beginner camera for those who would like to get started in digital photography. I purchased mine at Wal-Mart for only $219 making it a great value. 

The GOOD:
1. The LCD display has a fast refresh making it practical as a viewfinder.
2. You can manually control the exposure and white balance.
3. You have the ability to take macro pictures (close ups).
4. It uses AA batteries, is flash card capable, has both digital and video out.
5. It provides megapixel pictures. In addition, the pictures are digital, making it easier to store.
6. the PRICE. 

The BAD:
1. The quality of the picture may not be as good as some of the more expensive megapixel camera.
2. The manual is not very helpful.

and the UGLY:
1. It is slightly large than some of the other megapixel cameras.


Some tips if you are planning to buy it:
1. Get NiMH rechargeable batteries. You will need them.
2. It is nice to have a flash card with a USB flash card reader. This makes it easier to store and load the pictures into the computer.
3. A CD-R is a great way to store the pictures for archiving.


Overall it is a great buy for the price it is selling at.
