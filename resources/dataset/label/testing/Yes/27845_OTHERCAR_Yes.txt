            I bought my 1997 Mitsubishi Galant in Oct of '97.  I have really enjoyed this car.  For the price and all the additional options, I have been very happy.  My Galant came with a sunroof, power windows, cruise control, alarm system, sporty tire rims, etc.  I have really enjoyed the space on the inside of the Galant.  It is able to handle four adults comfortably.  I will probably trade my Galant in next year for a 2001 model.  <br><br>
