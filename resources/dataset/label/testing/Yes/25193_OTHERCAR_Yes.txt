            The Mazda Protege is a great car. It is definitly the leader in its class. The Protege shines with its handling and ability. For a relitivly cheap car the Protege has a great feel. It has a good ride, with exceptional smoothness. But, it does bottom out often. The manual transmission does great once you get used to it, but the gas pedal is very sensitive, so it might take you a while. It is fairly quick and does good on the interstate and in the city. It handles well in almost all situations because of its front wheel drive. The interior is descent. The front seats are comfortable, but the back seats provide little support, especially in turns. The cabin is very large with a good amount of leg room in the front seats, and in the back seats. It has drivers side and passengers side air bags, wich is good. The stereo is good for a standard factory system. The CD player is picky, and rejects CD's if you put them in to quickly after removing one. It has good gas mileage wich is good with todays high prices. The air conditioning, heat, and defrost work well. Overall the Mazda Protege is a great car, with a great value.<br><br>
