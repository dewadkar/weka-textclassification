            I am so impressed with my new 2001 Olds. Alero GLS sedan. I've got the loaded version in Black Onyx - leather interior, power everything, keyless entry system, sunroof, 3.4 liter V6 engine, 17&quot; alum. wheels with low profile tires, fog lamps, rear spoiler, 8 speaker Bose sound system.
The windows come lightly tinted. I don't even know where to start!

First of all, it's a gorgeous looking car - even for a 4 door. Honda's and Toyota's sedans completely bored me in the looks department. Oldsmobile's Alero gives the term &quot;sedan&quot; a sporty new twist. The car does stand high - esp. in the back. This takes a little getting used to if you've been driving a vehicle that stands low in the back - you don't get to see as much out the back window as you used to. Those of you who do not get the rear spoiler won't have this problem so much.

The leather interior is very nice - though not as soft as I'd hoped. The seats are very comfortable, though there isn't too much extra head room in the front. And if you're riding in the back you may not be too comfortable if you're over 6 feet tall - then again what do you expect from a smaller sedan? :) If you're someone who will be driving people who are 6 feet tall and over in the back seat, then you might want to get the full sized Aurora instead! The back seats fold forward for extra trunk space. The trunk is already very roomy, by the way. It includes a cargo net. The spare tire is a compact one.

The controls for the A/C and radio are easy to reach without looking away from the road. The radio controls do take some getting used to but only because there is so much you can do with it! Be sure to read your manual and learn how to use it before taking to the road. The shift knob has a button on the left, which seems to make sense since your thumb fits it nicely - but be sure to not hit the button by accident with your leg while you're driving. I think they probably could have improved that by putting the button on the front of knob where your fingers are, as the Neon does. 

There are 2 cup holders in the front if you are a non-smoker, and 2 in the back seat. The cup holder that doubles as an ashtray is snugly behind the shift knob when the vehicle is in park. However, if you are in park you probably don't have a big necessity for a cup holder - and if you do, you can easily use the second one which is located between the shift knob and the storage compartment. If you are a smoker, you can still have a power plug available when the lighter is plugged in - Olds. has placed a second power plug on the passenger side of the controls. Very convenient.

The dash lamps are blue and can be dimmed. The gear position is shown on the dash and the odometer/tripometer is digital. There are warnings for just about everything - it even has an oil monitor that records your driving habits and uses that data to let you know when you should change your oil. The low pressure monitor will tell you when one of your tires should be inflated more. If you leave your fuel door open, there is a light that will warn you. Speaking of the fuel tank, it is located on the passenger side of the vehicle - a BIG plus in my book because I won't have to worry about pulling up too close to open my door anymore. There is no lock or security feature on the gas tank, however. I recommend buying a locking gas cap for the fuel tank. I usually get about 26 miles to a gallon - half highway, half city. 

This car includes daytime running lamps, child proof door locks and windows, and a passlock system (theft deterrent) that requires only the correct key to start the car. If any other key is used or if someone tries to start the car any other way, the car will disable the fuel system so that it cannot be stolen. Insurance companies like these things :)

The ride is very smooth and very quiet. The car handles beautifully - very tight. The brakes are also sensitive and fast-acting. Has nice fast acceleration.

The car comes with a 3 yr / 30,000 mile warranty which can be extended to 5 yrs for an extra charge. 

******Problems I've had********

This review was first written when I got the car 3 years ago. Since then, I've put 49,900 miles on the car and I've had a few problems with it, all covered under the extended warranty. 

12/31/02 (32,750 miles) - Check Engine Light was on. Brought it in to dealer - had Oil Pressure Switch, EGR Valve, and FTP Sensors replaced. Tech also found a damaged shift solenoid valve which he replaced. Left axle seal was leaking - everything was fixed under warranty.

06/23/03 (40,087 miles) - Traction Off light, Service Vehicle Soon light, and Anti-Lock lights were on. Also seemed to be leaking coolant. Dealer checked and found that there was a faulty wheel speed sensor and the intake gasket was leaking oil and coolant. All parts covered under extended warranty.

09/08/03 (approx. 44,000 miles) - Car spins over, won't start. Cause = ignition lock switch went out. (This is the anti-theft feature that keeps the car from being started w/o the key) Replaced under extended warranty.

12/02/03 (49,455 miles) - Car spins over, won't start. Cause = Faulty fuel pump and fuel level sensor reading wrong. Replaced under extended warranty.

I highly suggest if you are even thinking about buying this car - test drive one at your dealer (don't rent one - the rental ones are cheap low end versions with no nice options).
