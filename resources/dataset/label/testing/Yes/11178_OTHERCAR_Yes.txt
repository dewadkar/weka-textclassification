            We've had Hondas...  We've had Nissans...  but we've never owned vehicles as reliable as Toyotas.

We bought our 1995 LE/SC Previa used, in 1998, and have enjoyed every mile in it.  Aside from its unique styling and &quot;jelly bean-like&quot; appearance, it offers tons of features unequaled by other minivans.

Our Previa has the captain's chairs in the middle row, and these are a God-send on long (and short) trips.  No more cries of &quot;Mom, he's touching me!&quot;  The kids are well-separated and enjoy their own amenities.  These chairs even swivel 180 degrees to face the rear seats ~ a handy feature if you've pulled off the road to sit out a torrential rain, and want to get a card game started!  Every seat in our Previa has its own drink holders, and the middle row captain's chairs have a feature I've never seen in another minivan: dual seat belts.  You can use the lap-only belt (handy if you're using a car seat and don't want to mess with the locking clip), or you can use the standard shoulder/lap combo.

Need more room to load cargo in the rear?  Simply (and easily!) fold the rear seats against the side walls and you've created a virtual cavern.  (No need to remove and store the rear seat!)  This feature comes in especially handy when you've made a spur-of-the-moment purchase of something large and are wondering how you're going to get it home.

We've hauled the family from New Mexico to the Canadian border in our Previa, without any hesitation or complaint on its part.  The SC (super-charged) engine makes for a very quiet and economical ride on the highway.  The gas mileage around town, I must say, leaves something to be desired.  We average 19 mpg with lots of stop/start driving; we get about 24 mph on the open road.

The Previas were considered to be at the expensive end of the price range when they were new on the market.  As a result, they were purchased for the most part by people who intended to treat them well, have them serviced regularly, and keep precise maintenance records.  The vast majority of the used Previas offered today are in extremely good shape for their age and/or mileage.  So if you've got a growing family and are ready to make the move into the minivan market, take a good look at the Previa.  You won't be disappointed!<br><br>
