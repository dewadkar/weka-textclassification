            In 2000, my parents found me a beautiful (rusty) white '90 Nissan Maxima.  By the time it found me, it had acquired 135,000 miles, and the automatic antennae and radio were kaput.  In the three years that I drove it, 'major/out of the ordinary' work done on the car included the replacement of some ventilation apparatus in the front of the car (a broken pipe was leaking fumes into the car), and the distributor cap (the car refused to start in rain, or would start, get me halfway to where I needed to be and die).

Otherwise, "Meghan's Car" was an incredible comerad.  (A year later, we found a black 1990 maxima for my sister to drive because we were so impressed with the car.)  It was dependable even in the worst of Chicago's inclement weather, the AC worked better in my nissan than in my mum's brand new durango, and although it had its aches, pains, and groans, it lasted me 3 years and kept on kicking even through 12 hours of highway driving at speeds of 80/90mph (although, after that trip in particular, she would make a 'helicopter noise' when I got her up to 55mph.  

She was still going strong through year 13... until I managed to wrap her front around the bumper of a pt. cruiser.  The belts (yes, both lap and shoulder) kept my sis and I in place, and we were able to walk away unharmed.

So, in the search for another dependable, inexpensive used vehicle, we found yet *another* 1990 Nissan Maxima.  My sister got the 'new'-'used car' and her black maxima was passed on to me.  -Its so good to be able to 'knock on Nissan' again.

Despite a fair amount of abuse on my part, she made me feel safe on the highway.  When I finally had an accident, myself and my passenger were saved by the belts.  Heart of gold?  -I meant heart of platinum.
