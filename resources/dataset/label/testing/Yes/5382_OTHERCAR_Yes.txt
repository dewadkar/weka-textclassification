            I purchased a 1998 Dakota Club Cab new in July, 1998.  I previously had been a diehard Japanese nameplate owner and I researched this vehicle extensively before buying.  The research paid off and I've been remarkably impressed with nearly every facet of this vehicle.  Before I begin the details of the review, keep in mind that this is truck; not an Acura Legend with a large trunk!  That said, you need to temper your expectations with, and compare against, other vehicles in the same genre.

I'm a 6'5&quot; systems consultant.  I spend a great deal of time at client locations and often carry tools, laptops, network components, cable, and bags of equipment with me to the job.  The Dakota is overkill for the comparatively small weights that I carry along.  The Club Cab has enormous amounts of space and, packed correctly, I can carry nearly everything I need in the cab.  Inside the cab also is my favorite part of the Dakota.  I had driven nearly every competing vehicle in this genre (S10, Ford Ranger, GMC Sonoma, etc.) and the Dakota is the hands down winner in terms of space, comfort, noise attenuation, and vehicle ride.   Boxy, noisy, cramped, and uncomfortable were terns that immediately came to mind inside both the Ranger and the Sonoma.  With the exception of the audio controls (a problem, it seems, on all Chrysler nameplates), all the cabin controls are positioned correctly and are easily adjusted without causing distraction while driving.  Dodge has done a terrific job of making the Dakota as easy and as comfortable to drive as some cars.  At freeway speeds under cruise control, the Dakota tracks straight and is surprisingly quiet.  I've been very pleased with the cabin fit, finish, and ergonomics and these add to the spacious feeling when driving.  

Under the hood, my Dakota has the Magnum V6 which, as the sales data suggests, is the most popular engine for this model.  The 4 doesn't quite cut it and, in reality, probably shouldn't even be offered on a vehicle this big.  The big Magnum V8 also is a popular option but was overkill for my purposes.  Boat, camper, and trailer owners may decide that the bigger mill is the way to go.  While I'm on the engine subject, if the Dakota does have a flaw, it's its fuel economy.  The nominal V6 specifications are 16 and 21.  My mileage in real life has been around 15 and 24 respectively.  I'm a light-footed driver and do a lot of higher speed interstate driving.  This was an initial concern of mine during the research phase of my purchase but remember what I alluded to earlier -- this is a truck.  The flip side of the fuel economy coin is the Magnum V6 provides ample HP and torque and I've never found it necessary to work the accelerator hard to move the vehicle under most driving scenarios. 

Dodge has made both the bigger Ram and the Dakota look as aesthetically pleasing as trucks can be.  The exterior looks, especially the front of the vehicle, are smooth and well-rounded and do not at all peg the vehicle as a truck.  Excellent mirrors and a precise fit with respect to the door jams and tailgate round out the vehicle exterior.  My one complaint --  and in Dodge's defense isn't really a complaint because I knew this when I bought it -- is the lack of four doors.  It sounds trivial but I'm continually amazed at how often I need to get &quot;back there&quot; to retrieve equipment, load cargo, etc. and I just really wish the 1998 Dakota had four doors.  The 2000 model does have four &quot;real&quot; doors.

My Dakota has seen only routine maintenance that follows the OEM schedule to the letter.  I've had zero mechanical problems and, despite the vehicle's thirst for fuel, I believe that, as trucks go, this Dakota is on par with the legendary reliability of previous Honda vehicles that I've owned.  I would recommend the Dakota to anyone considering a vehicle in which a full-size truck is too large but do not care for the boxy, cramped, and noisy attributes of the traditional small truck entrants.  Well done, Dodge.
