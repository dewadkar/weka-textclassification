            <b>My Toyota & other history</b>
Can I really give you a good review on motorized transport?  Well, here's a list of the vehicles I've owned (in chronological order):
1989 Ford Mustang GT
1990 Acura Integra RS
1992 Suzuki GSX1100R 
1993 Honda Prelude SR
1989 Suzuki Sidekick 4wd
1994 Geo Tracker 2wd
1989 Honda CRX Si
1994 Toyota 'Pick-up' 4wd
2002 Toyota RAV4
2000 Toyota Tacoma 4wd

As you can see, recent history has favoured the Toyota marque.  I've had such excellent history with Toyota, and had over 300,000km on the Pick-up before I traded it on the RAV.  You can read my review on the RAV to get all the details, but the major reason I got back into a Tacoma was I needed something a little hardier off-road.

<b>Keep looking</b>
I had been looking for another Tacoma for a few months, and happened to be talking the the gal who sold me the RAV - she had just gotten a Tacoma in, and said she'd hold it for me.  I live 5 hours away from dealer, and in the meantime there was a lot of action on the truck - still, she kept her word and a week later when I finally got up there, it was ready for me to take home.

<b>Tacoma motor details</b>
What I ended up with was a 2000 Tacoma 'Value Package A' Extended Cab 4x4.  In 2000, the 'A' package got you air, tilt, cruise, remote mirrors, a CD player and not much else.  It came equipped with the automatic transmission, and 31x10.5 inch Goodyear tires.  In newer model years, the 'A' package comes with more goodies.  In the Tacoma motor line-up, you can start with a 2.4l 142hp-160lbs/ft available only in the 2wd, a 2.7l 150hp-177lbs/ft in the 4x4, and a 190hp-220lbs/ft in the 4x4 V6.  I've heard the 2.7l is quite torquey for it's size, but I've never seen one here in Canada.  For the modest decrease in mileage, the only reason to avoid the V6 is if you really need to save the $3000 price difference between the 2.7l and the 3.4l, or if the 2 mpg less is going to bother you.  The 3.4l is a nice motor - very smooth and lots of grunt.  The factory exhaust is nicely tuned to let a wee bit of rumble let you know it's there.  For those in need of more power, a factory supercharger, headers, and '7th injector' kit can combine to push you over 300hp (!) - pricey options, but covered by factory warranty. 

<b>To truck, or not to truck...</b>
Life with a truck is really divided into 2 seperate groups - those who like the styling and 'up high' ride of a truck, and those who need to haul stuff around that only a truck can carry to places only a truck can go.  The base model Tacomas can get you the look without so much hurt in the wallet, but if you need to play in the dirt - go right into the 4x4 V6.

What really sets the Tacomas apart in the 4x4 crowd, is their very capable off-road abilities without having a ridiculous on-road ride.  With the 31" tires, you've got nearly 12 inches of ground clearance, and it's very easy to get these trucks higher off the ground.  The Tacoma rides on a very beefy frame and suspension - even more robust than something you would expect to see on a full-size truck.  This contributes to their outstanding durability.

On a recent trip to Moab, UT, I couldn't help noticing the large percentage of Tacomas and 4-Runners around town, most oufitted for off-road adventure.  It's an easy vehicle to live with off-road.

<b>Life on the inside</b>
If you've been inside the previous generation 'Pick-up', you will feel right at home in the Tacoma.  The dash is pleasently styled, if rather spartan.  The speedo and tach are nice and big - front and centre, flanked by the fuel and temperature guages.  A myriad of warning lights keep you on top of any major problems.  If you ever see one light up, let me know - I never have except for the start-up diagnostics.  If you are a button and gadget fan, you'll be disappointed.  The Tacoma dash is simple and functional, free of clutter and things to break.  It's truck-ish, but just 'soft' enough looking not to scare you.  A nice feature is the passenger-side airbag switch.  With the ignition key you can turn it off, in case you need to use a baby seat - as a baby seat will not fit into the back of the extended cab properly.  The lack of dedicated side-window defrosters still puzzles me... with winter here 6 months of the year, having to keep adjusting the side vents to point at the windows is a chore I'd rather not have.  For smaller drivers, the floor-shift automatic is a bit of a reach.  Even full-size drivers need to lean right a bit to manoever it.  Fortunately, the transfer case lever is closer, and only requires a slight lean forward to engage.

<b>Mind your manners</b>
How about on-road behavior?  The Tacoma rides well without any bone-jarring fuss, but it doesn't let you forget it's a truck either.  On rutted pavement (from semis), the truck tends to jump around a bit if you are riding on bigger tires as they don't quite fit in the ruts.  It's not a problem with the truck, as I've had other fat-tired vehicles that do the same.  I love the solid feeling you can only get from a body-on-frame vehicle - you can pound over some vicious railway tracks without the doors falling off (or even rattling).  The rear suspension is the typical leaf-spring setup on most trucks, so the back end will move around a bit on continuously rough terrain - the independent coil-spring front suspension is very solid and makes up for it.  Steering is a bit heavy, but I like the feel of it.  Braking effort too is something you need to be aware of, but isn't too hard.

<b>Mind the intangibles</b>
One of the best features of a Tacoma is the easy resale and great price you can get for them.  They seldom come back to the dealer, as the demand for them is fairly high.  Even after 8 years and 300,000K, I got $10,000 for my old Tacoma.  I expect this truck will do even better - the engine is much more advanced - the 3.4L is good for 190HP has plenty of torque for pulling.  There aren't many little trucks that can pull 5000lbs - but the Tacoma can, and carry almost 2000lbs in the box.

Many a gas-jockey has asked me if 'your truck is for sale', and the only bad thing a Tacoma owner has ever told me is 'the baby seat doesn't fit in the back'.  With the new quad-cab model, now you've got an option to solve that problem as well.

<b>Executive summary</b>
If you're squishy-tush executive butt hasn't become too soft riding around in pseudo-offroad SUVs, you'll love your Tacoma.
