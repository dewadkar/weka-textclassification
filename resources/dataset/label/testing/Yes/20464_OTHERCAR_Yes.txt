                 I purchased my 1996 Chevrolet Lumina brand new.  The sticker price was around $18,000, but with the rebate and GM discount I paid approximately $13,000 for the car. When I went out car shopping I didn�t have a Chevy Lumina in mind, but after looking at many different cars and test driving them, I purchased the Lumina.

     Mine is burgundy exterior with gray interior.  I�m not a car expert, so please forgive me if I am lacking some information that might be important if you are interested in buying a car like mine.

    It has a V-6 engine, automatic transmission, anti lock brakes, cruise control, tilt wheel, AM/FM/Cassette, air conditioning, power windows and door locks, and drivers side remote side view mirror.  I hope I�m not forgetting anything.

     The fabric seats are very comfortable and they conform to the shape of your body.  The headrests are adjustable.  The seat belts are also adjustable, so if you�re short they aren�t choking you.

     There is a lot of leg room in the front and back seats.  It fits four people very comfortably.  Three people in the back is still comfortable.  If you put three people in the front, it starts to get a little crowded.

     The car handles nicely on all road types....straight roads and roads with lots of twists and turns.  The V-6 engine has lots of pep and goes up steep hills nicely.  It has front wheel drive and handles very nicely in the snow.  The back end doesn�t fishtail in snow or rain.

     The noise level inside the car with the windows closed is very low.  You don�t get a lot of tire noise like some cars.  

     The car has been very reliable.  I have done the routine maintenance, like oil changes once or twice a month (every 3,000 miles), and have had no mechanical breakdowns at all.

     I did have one minor problem and that was because I didn�t shut the engine off when I filled the gas tank and it caused the �check engine� light to come on.  Once I learned that it�s not good to fill the tank with the engine running, even if you are in a hurry, I haven�t had a problem since then.

     The gas mileage is about average.  I�m not sure what the actual gas mileage is, but I�m sure it must get at least manufacturer�s suggested mileage.

     Also, I had an accident a year ago and I broadsided another car when the man made a left turn in front of me while I was going straight.  I must say that the car held up pretty good on impact, and I only suffered minor muscle tightness from the impact and no other injuries.  The front end of the car needed to be repaired, but I haven�t had a problem with
it after repair.  I hit the guy pretty hard, too.  It didn�t even knock the wheels out of alignment.  The other guys car (Ford Taurus) was pretty well smashed in, but mine wasn�t too bad.  When I got out of my car and looked at my actual damage, I was surprised because I expected to see the front end of my car hanging on the ground, but it wasn�t.  

     Overall, I am very pleased with the Chevy Lumina and would purchase another one if I wanted a new car.  But I think I will keep the one I have for quite a few more years. Why get rid of a car that has no problems?
