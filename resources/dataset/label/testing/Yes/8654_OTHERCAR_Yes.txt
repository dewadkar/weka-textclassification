            Had this car about 4 months. Very nice power, smooth shifting and solid body. Fitted Toyo 800 Ultra tires to replace worn out Goodyears. The electrical gadgets are overkill for me - rainsense wipers and such. Is it such a chore to turn on the wipers when it rains? The Bose stereo sounds great, but the optional CD changer would be better in the trunk than hogging all that space in the console. I am 6'6" and have to recline the drivers seat quite a bit or else I hit the roof. Back seat headroom - horrible. Cadillac calls it Theater seating or somesuch, wish they would increase the headroom rather than find a silly name for it. There is a reason why the rear seat is a little high - there is a car battery and fuse box under the seat. Seems crazy to me that they couldn't free up space in the front for that stuff and have the rear seat at conventional height. Given the exterior size of the car, the interior ought to be a bit roomier. The Deville is probably a lot roomier, but I don't care for the Grandad styled exterior.

Quality? So far I had a leaking water pump gasket, door window switch failure, brake pad sensors not working and other minor quibbles fixed under warranty. Warning - engine coolant is DexCool type and it is important you don't let the level drop below maximum. Low coolant level is known to block radiators and blocks. Front brake pads are 30% worn after nearly 40,000 miles, which is a lot better than I expected. The brakes are good, but you are aware that this is a 4,000 pound lump to stop. Didn't drive through a snowy winter yet, but I expect the traction control and ABS to be a big safety plus. Planning to put Amsoil Series 2000 0W-30 oil and universal ATF in the car, as I need to keep this beauty running for a long time. With such a powerful engine and generally sedate driving style, this car should last. Previous car was a 1991 Volvo 740, which feels like a stone age car compared to the Seville.

I have owned quite a few cars, and rent many, many cars in my business travel. This Cadillac is so comfortable I really miss it when I have to drive something else. Only real drawback I have is the terrible resale value, but I bought used so someone else took the major hit. Not sure if the low resale is justified because the car is not up to the quality of its competition, or the name Cadillac isn't respected next to Lexus or Mercedes. Time will tell.
