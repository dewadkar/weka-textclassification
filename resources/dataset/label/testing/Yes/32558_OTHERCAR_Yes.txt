            I bought a new Saturn SL2 in 1997.  The only reason that I walked into the dealership was that approximately 4 months earlier, my girlfriend (at the time) wanted to buy a car - preferably a Saturn.  I went with her to all of the local dealerships, and the difference at Saturn was incredible!
The salespeople were friendly, but not pushy, and extremely knowledgeable.  She was treated in a professional manner, and the whole transaction of buying a car was the easiest that I had ever seen.

Because of that experience, when I planned to buy a new car a few months later, the Saturn dealership was the only place I went.  No hassles and a great car to boot!  Since then, I have had basically no trouble with the car and it still rides incredibly well 3 years later!<br><br>
