            I've been using this Sony Mavica camera for about a year and find it pretty useful to have around. I use it all the time to take pictures of my items on ebay and it does a very nice job of it. On the other hand, the times I've tried to use this camera to photograph people-oriented events I have not been very happy with the results, the resolution is not sharp enough for good portraits and skin tones can come out unnatural. 

Taking pictures on the fly is so easy now. I love being able to capture the moment without taking a roll of film in for processing. But if I wanted to do anything else with these photos than post them online, I would not use this camera. 

It also does have a nice series of effects, such as black &amp; white, sienna, and tints, but the pictures are not really crisp enough to fully enjoy having these effects.

The menu options are good, you can scan through all of the pictures on the disk pretty quickly and easily transfer them to your PC by floppy disk. The battery life (a rechargeable) is also very good. $499 is not a bad price for this solid digital camera. The price will probably come down even more in the near future. 

So if you are not looking to replace your normal camera and need an extra one to post images online, this is your camera. If not, check out some of the new Mavicas which will cost a little more but will make better substitutes.<br><br>
