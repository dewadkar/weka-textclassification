            General: The camera does its job. It is a rugged, megapixel camera with cool features and good value. You can pick the resolution with a button on the top, choosing 1 to 3 stars and then "hi pict" which is a computerized enhancement (1600x1200). It has a 3x optical and a 2x digital zoom which can only be accessed through the LCD (same with panorama and macro). Some of the 1 star pics can be grainy but 2 stars will solve that. If the camera is left on, the it will turn off. I really like the picture viewing function, the menu is well-organized making for easy browsing and deleting. You can even zoom in on them.
Downloading pics is easy and straightforward, just remember to unplug the cord from the camera or it will not turn off.

The Good: This camera has really cool features like the sunlit display which saves batteries and actually works. One of the things that really makes this camera a bargain is the rechargeable batteries and charger that come with this camera. There is a timer, multiple flash settings and a "slide show" feature you can use on the camera or on the t.v. (cable incl). You can also lock the "on\off" dial. For experienced photographers there are adjustments for ISO, white balance and +\- 2 exposure control. You can also print directly to some Epson printers. The camera has capacity for 178 pictures on the lowest setting. The helpline people at Epson were easy to deal with and knowledgeable

The Bad: Sometimes I wish it had red-eye reduction, that there was manual focus and that the +\- was easier to use. The zoom is tricky and I have lost some cool pics because of it. Shutter lag is also an issue making some pictures blurry if you don't keep it in place. I read in the manual that with continuous shot, you can take 2 pictures a second. I have not found this to be the case. To get the full 178 pictures out of your camera you have to remove the 8 mb flash card to use the internal 4 mb. 

Concluding: all the benefits far outweigh any disadvantages. The batteries and charger, sunlit display and overall quality take this from a decent megapixel to a kick in the pants camera. I bought it at Buy.com for $400 through cnet.com. cnet has reviews, recommendations and more, check it out before buying anything online.
