            I have wanted a digital camera for a while.  Mostly because I sell lots of stuff at eBay, but also to take pics of the kids to put online for family and friends to see.  Because of this I wanted one that didn't limit the number of pics I took at a time (not counting battery time.)  I figured a camera that used a floppy disk was the best option.  I did a little research online and came up with a super deal on this Sony MVC-73 at the digital dog.  Only $376, which included shipping!!!

I have had a great experience with this camera so far.  I recently took it to an MLB game and the pictures were awesome...close ups and stadium views alike.  I haven't experienced much on different brightnesses or other effects because it is just a simple click and go camera.  I have been happy with the ease.  Even my son has taken some good shots!

I wasn't totally sure on the amount of pics that I got on each battery charge, so I guessed 50-100.  I guess this is the biggest drawback.  I know longer batteries are available.  I wish it came with an AC cord, so I could take my shots around here without a battery.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a digital camera that uses a floppy.  I know this is one of the cheapest ones with this capability, but the pics aren't cheap to me.  I just love it!!!!!!!! <br><br>
