            After having an incredibly positive experience with a Honda Accord, my husband purchased a used 1994 Integra hatchback (stick shift) in 1995 when the Accord finally required a new clutch.  After 6 years, the Acura is still in perfect condition...and my hubby is not exactly gentle with his cars.  Other than routine maintenance like replacing the tires and changing the oil, we have not had any major expenses associated with this car (well, my hubby did get in an accident and needed some body work, but that had nothing to do with the quality of the car)!  

I have owned a 1987 Toyota Supra and presently drive a 1995 Ford Windstar, and neither have been even remotely as expense and repair free and reliable as this Acura has been (now if only they'd come out with an affordable mini-van, I'd be first in line to purchase one).  

My only gripe is that we unfortunately have the two door model so it is a little clumsy getting two kids in and out of their carseats which are in the rear seats of the car.  Of course, the car came before the kids so that wasn't one of the criteria we were looking for when we made the purchase :)<br><br>
