            We were in the market for another new vehicle.  I did a lot of homework.  We've always purchased Japanese auto's as we've become accustom to their modern design, quality materials, ride, and reliability.  We have never bothered to look at American, as we've always found them to be of cheap components, sketchy reliability, inferior plastic and outdated technology instrumentation.  We were in the market for a larger SUV.  One with three rows of seating and lots of versatility.  Looked at Volvo, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.  Stumbled across the Pacifica.  Was not impressed with the overall feel of the Nissan Armada.  The Volvo XC90 was too overpriced as with any quality name, but we did like the look and feel.  The Honda Pilot was boring, as with many of Honda's latest vehicles. Happened to just peak at the Pacifica and took it for a test drive just to see what this American auto was like.  Well, we purchased one the next day.

Things we liked:

This vehicle is in the top 2 of any I've EVER driven with regard to performance and quality feel.  Has a very solid German luxury car feel to it.  The leather is top notch; I'd go as far as to say even better than most luxury leather interiors I've seen.  The other items we're the dashboard instruments.  Very modern, in fact the most technologically advanced I've seen.  Only exception is the radio components.  American auto designers really need to get way from the old amber green radio displays, as it's very dated.  The seating throughout is very luxurious and comfortable.  A big change from my prior memory of any American vehicle.  The bucket seats throughout are supportive and adjust to each persons liking.  The second row folds down for convenience.  The 3rd row, although good for any age kids, does work for adults by moving the second row slightly forward.  This still allows for ample room for all passengers.  I've read many reviews in magazines and online about complaints with regard to fuel mileage and performance.  I'm not sure what they're speaking of because our AWD Pacifica handles quite nicely and acceleration is above what I've ever been accustom to. Perhaps they're looking for a Porsche or RSX?  Also, gas mileage is not bad, but it's not great.  We get better gas mileage in this than we do in our other SUV.  About 22 miles to the gallon in the city. Needless to say, the Pacifica acceleration seams effortless when passing.  It's so fun to drive.  I actually look forward to driving this vehicle each day.  Access to the all areas of the vehicle is exceptional.  It's low enough for easy in and out access, and the tailgate is terrific.  Auto opens and closes!  So if your hands are full, just hit the button on the key fob.  Safety in this vehicle is superb.  Air bags all around, including front airbags for you knees.  

Things we didn&#146t like:

So what are the cons you may ask?  Not too many. I'm thoroughly impressed with this SUV/CAR/MINIVAN.  I'd say it's more of an SUV without all the off road garbage none of us will really ever use.  Some say it looks too much like a station wagon.  I'd beg to differ and challenge them to drive it for one week.  This comes from someone who never bought American.  I do have a few nit picky items.  Side mirrors are too small for backing up.  The radio dials in the center dash are out dated green.  Should have been consistent with the rest of the instrumentation, which is superior to 99% of vehicles on the road today.
