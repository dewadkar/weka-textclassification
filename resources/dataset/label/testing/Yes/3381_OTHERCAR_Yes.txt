            This 2001 Nissan Pathfinder is a winner !  This is my first SUV, and my experience has been wonderful.  The engine is a very powerful V6, with lots of horsepower, and for an SUV, outpowers so much of the competition (I tried several others).  The ride is very smooth. Even in the snow, once you engage the 4 Wheel Drive, it maneuvers very well. The only trouble is the low gas mileage, at only 15 or 16 mpg. There are so many nice standard and optional features, including a temperature gauge, beautiful sunroof, keyless entry, radio controls on the steering wheel, 6 CD disc changer, etc. There is also great storage in the back, for those long trips. The Pathfinder is a bit high on the price, but it is well worth it, if you can spare a few extra bucks. I highly recommend it.
