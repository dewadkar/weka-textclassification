            I bought this camera so I could use it in my classroom on student projects.  I wasnt sure what to expect, what I found was a pleasant surprise.  This camera does a super job with very nice pictures in SHQ mode.  If you have a good color printer and use good glossy photo paper you will be very happy with the resulting pictures.  For project or web page pictures standard pictures will do.  The camera is compact yet has many of the qualties of a very good Olympus SLR.  It is of course an Olympus and acts like one,  good quality.  One down side is that it does eat the batteries, so plan on getting an ac adaptor.  All in all a super camera at a pretty good price.<br><br>
