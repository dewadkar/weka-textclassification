            I am the third owner of my Isuzu Rodeo S (2WD w/ V6), having bought it from a friend approximate 8 months ago.  He bought it 4 years ago and so I have been able to observe its history.

Considering the price I paid for the car -- well below the KBB value -- and the knowledge that of who I was buying it from, I consider it to be a great deal.  To find a quality SUV with 100,000 miles for under $7,000 is difficult -- try looking at what a 4Runner or Pathfinder goes for in the same condition!

The V6 is plenty strong for daily driving, with little difference felt with 4 passengers.  The 5-spd manual whisks through the gears with relative ease, maximizing the horses under the hood.  I'm skeptical about the MAX towing capacity of 4,500lbs., but of course no manufacture is concerned to tell you how meager the engine will perform if maxed out!  Having never pulled anything that big, it's difficult to tell.  But my hunch would be that your performance would drop off noticeably as you get up around 3000lbs.

The stock tires (P225/75R15) are small...and they definitely show it if you pull up to most any other SUV.  I recently upgraded up to P245/70R15's for slightly more surface area on the ground, but unfortunately the 15x6 wheels just don't cut it for a serious SUV look.  The newer models with 16 wheels is a marked improvement.

The visibility is among the best I've seen in the SUV market.  Of all the SUV's that I've been in and have driven, this ranks among the best I've seen.

I haven't really done much off road travel...and don't plan on it without 4WD.  The V6 does decent on moderate dirt roads, but I'd caution against anything more rigorous!

Consumer reports typically are critical of the handling/driving of the Rodeo...and I would have to concur.  For a SUV that really isn't designed to go off-road, my daily commutes to work often feel like I am off-roading!  Of course, if you like the rugged SUV feel (as I do), it's not a huge problem.  People riding in the back have complained that my driving feels rough...and I don't think that's due to any lack of ability on my part! :)  All things considered, if you *really* want better road handling, a similarly equipped '97 Pathfinder does a little better!  The question is whether you want to pay the extra for the Pathfinder to get the extra comfort!

Now to some of the problem areas!

First, a couple other reviewers have complained about the transmission going out.  This transmission was replaced at about 85,000 [I bought it with 105,000!], and it was a rather costly repair for the former owner.  So far, no problems with the new transmission.  I still get the projected gas mileage...on average about 17.5 mpg!

Second, Isuzu Rodeo's formally came equipped with a lugnut that was not standard issue (compared to most cars).  Most car lugs are torqued at 100...and so many tire places set their torque guns at that ratio.  However, the Rodeo's lugs are set to 80...and over time (if torqued wrong) they will wear out and 'strip.'  On my last tire change, one of the bolts and pints stripped...and theoretically it could happen to any of the remaining 23 too! The bummer news is that it will cost you around $11.00 to buy a new lug nut and bolt...each!  Just do the math (24 x $11.00) and you have an expensive job on your hands!  At first, I was just skeptical when two oil changes ago the service tech didn't want to change my tires because of this fear.  Now, I know that this is just a problem that some of the older Rodeo's have...so be ready for it!  Any car with around 100,000 or more is probably in danger or problems here.

I recently had to have my master and slave clutch cylinders replaced...which will easily be a $350 job if you can't do it yourself.  Whether or not this is a common failure on Rodeo's, I can't say!

BOTTOM LINE: If you want a relatively inexpensive entry way into the used SUV market -- say for your children -- the Rodeo is a good way to go.  It has proved reliable with proper care, though it may lack the sophistication of the more expensive 4Runners and Pathfinders.  The truth is that any SUV over 100,000 is liable to need to expensive repairs...so in that sense the cheaper Rodeo may be a better way to go if you are mindful of your pocketbook!
