            I asked my husband that question when he first suggested it might be our next new car.  This Korean company is gradually making it's mark in the United States and the Leganza has proven to be a great car for the money!

Our Leganza CDX is fully loaded with powered leather seats, power sun roof, climate control system, and a great stereo system with CD changer.  The stereo system is more complicated than the system we have in our home - but the sound is wonderful.  I am still learning how to operate it, but there are several programmed settings that give different sounds.  Some of these include &quot;Hallway&quot;, Theater&quot;, and &quot;Stadium&quot; and literally give you the sound of being at a concert.  Although my car doesn't shake nor does my heart palpitate when I listen to music, this is a great benefit to music lovers.

I especially appreciate the lumbar support and adjustable seats for my back problems.  I am use to travelling in a Cadillac, but this car is pretty comfortable for a mid-size vehicle.

I also have to rave about the remote keyless entry.  This literally is the only way I can find my car in a parking lot!  Instead of walking down every aisle trying to remember where in the <b>world</b> I left my car, I now casually and suavely stroll into the parking lot, click my remote, and my lights blink at me.  If only they could climb out of my purse, I wouldn't have to dump it on the ground in order to find them.

Another exciting feature included in the price of the car is the Road Side Service.  My husband got a flat tire on the highway in rush hour traffic and called the 800 number.  They sent a tow truck which took him and our car to our local Dealer.  The annual road side service we have always used in the past cost an additional $75 so this is an added value.

Daewoo's other &quot;claim to fame&quot; is their vehicle maintenance.  For three years, they totally maintain the car at their expense with tune ups, oil changes, repairs...they will even replace the windshield wipers at no charge.  When you take the car in for regular maintenance, they will detail the car for you.  If you are in the habit of purchasing a separate maintenance agreement with your new car, this is another added value - not to mention that most vehicle maintenance programs do not include oil changes and tune ups.

Now let me talk about the mileage!  We are getting 31 miles to the gallon locally.  My husband puts many miles on the car with local travel for our business with several stops throughout the day.  Highway and long distance travel gives us an even higher mileage.  With gas prices being as high as they have been, this is an incredible savings.

All this for under $15,000 (okay, my husband made a deal of the century).  But you can still buy this car new and fully loaded for under $18,000.  The Daewoo Leganza is high on my list.<br><br>
