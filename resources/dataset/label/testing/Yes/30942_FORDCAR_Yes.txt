            I bought this vehicle a year ago looking for something to get me back and forth to University and work that had some style and performance but it had to be easy on the wallet.  I decided to buy a Contour after I test drove one and seen how smooth the V6 was and how addictive it was to rev to the 6500RPM redline.  The car handles amazingly for a nondescript 4 door as well.  The 4 wheel disc brakes on my car with ABS are very powerful and are effective in all conditions. 
I bought a 1995 Contour GL with 70,000 Kms. 
Specs: 2.5L 24 valve all aluminum V6, 4 speed automatic transmission with O/D lockout, power drivers seat, power locks/windows, power 2-way sunroof, power/heated mirrors, cruise, keyless entry, 35% tint, 4 wheel disc brakes, 4 wheel ABS, alloy rims.
I was impressed by the level of content this car offered since it was a base model.  The performance of this car is amazing; the Contour offers European handling and a powerful high-tech, high-revving motor in a low priced car. This car is FAST!! It easily tops 180Km/h and does 0-100Km/h (0-60MPH) in around 8.5 seconds.  The ride is stiff but comfortable, and the handling is something you would not expect out of a car in this class. 
The definite low point (there always is) has been the terrible quality of this car.  It has been in the shop for a new alternator, new parking brake assembly, catalytic converter, O2 sensors, starting/stalling issues, engine light issues, engine coolant issues, etc,... It has also been afflicted with a high speed (110-120 Km/h) vibration from the front end and has been re-aligned and re-balanced dozens of times. There is occasionally a disgusting rotten egg smell that the car emits especially under hard acceleration on hot days - the dealers claim that the catalytic converter can't handle the emissions under hard acceleration. There are multiple squeaks and rattles from the dash/console/rear end that drive me absolutely crazy.  The fuel economy is decent but not spectacular and the tank is pretty small. The sheet metal seems to be pretty weak (it dents and dings VERY easily) and the paint quality is definitely below par.
This is a great car with respect to the motor/transmission combo, the brakes, and the awesome handling as well as the features offered for the price.  However, the build quality and the quality of componentry is unacceptable.
Overall I am happy with this car and amazed by it as well... just wished it held up better.
