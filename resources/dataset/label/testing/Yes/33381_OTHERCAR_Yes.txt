            Volkswagen's new Jetta TDI (Turbo Direct Injection) is like no Volkswagen, and certainly no diesel, you've driven before.  First, the car is almost luxurious.  Having grown up with the old Beetles, Squarebacks, and Buses, I was shocked to find the Jetta has power everything: locks, windows, sunroof, trunk and fuel cap.  Computers control the interior lighting, which turns off and on automatically at appropriate times.  

Second, this car is just plain fun to drive.  The turbocharged diesel engine is controlled by a computer that injects the fuel at exactly the right moment for the particular driving conditions.  Thus the car actually has acceleration; there is almost no smoke and little noise; and there is no noticeable diesel odor.  The steering is super tight, and the suspension is stiff, reflecting the fact that this is a German, not Japanese or American, car.  Four wheel disk brakes on standard 15 inch wheels add to the sports car feel.

Despite the (relative) power and quickness of the TDI diesel, it gets remarkable mileage.  Around town, I get about 40-45 mpg, slightly less than my old Rabbit and Jetta diesels, but on the highway at 60+ the mileage increases to a stunning 55-57 mpg.

Everything is not perfect with this car, however.  The front doors are extremely heavy and hard to manage when opening them from the inside out.  The panel that holds the sound system (which is superb) and climate controls is too low to be accessed or seen easily by the driver.  With time, one may be able to control everything by feel, but otherwise the drive must look completely away from the road and search around for the correct button or lever.  

Still, I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to try a diesel and who wants a relatively luxurious small car that is fun to drive.
