            At 17 years old, I had just obtained my license and like many kids my age....I needed some wheels!  I was sick of walking and relying on others for rides.  My sister visited a Mitsu dealer and bought a used non mitsu vehicle on the lot.  Two weeks later when we returned for (something I dont remember), I decided to take a look around and decided on a Mirage

Trim:  ES Coupe
Mileage:  21105  

The Car Buying Experience:
At the time, I was only 17 (my father cosigned for the car).  The dealer was very friendly and took time to answer all my questions intelligently and promptly.  He showed us all of what the car can and will do, all the little features.  The price we decided on was around 8500 at the time during the middle of 1995.  Within two hours of fist seeing the car, I was on my way home in my new car.  The salesman even called the following week to make sure the car met my needs.  

The Car:
I learned just how sweet the car really was.  It was small enough to fit in any parking spot but large enough to cram a few friends into.  I noticed the excellent gas mileage...sometimes getting up to 45 miles per a gallon.  
I even drove made a 170 mile trip to CT, did some running around in CT and drove back all on the same tank of gas with some to more left to spare!  

Wipers -- Worked well, never had a problem with them as long as I changed the wiper blades once a year.  

Defroster:  Clears the rear window in under a minute, it works pretty well.

The cup holders are pretty cool because when you are done using them they slide away out of sight.

The factory system produces EXCELLENT sound which is great for anyone like me that loves to blast their music.  The radio controls are pretty easy to work and you can program the radio without reading the manual first :)  

The center panel is set up pretty well, everything is right where it needs to be, so its not awkward trying to change a station or turn on the defroster when you are driving.

-----

The Mirage is not big on power (most small cars arent), but once you get it going it will definitely go.  The car goes from 0-60 in about nine seconds.  The engine isnt too loud or too quiet.  

-------

I was involved in three separate accidents (people just seem to say what a cute car, lets hit it-Surburban,Excel,Escort), three no fault accidents and my car is still going strong. Between the three accidents the car has roughly 5500 in body work done to it.  

-------

The Dreaded Panel Lights:

I guess nervousness compels me every morning when I start the car to stare at the dash saying "Oh Please Oh Please, dont stay on" to the panel lights.  There have been very few times when those lights did stay on.  

I had to make replace the o2 sensor at 46000 miles and soon after I bought new tires (just to buy them).  

I replaced the brake pads and rotors twice between then and 72000 miles.  

These are the only problems I have had with the take since I took ownership of it almost 6 years ago.  

Today at 80000 miles, I am extremely happy I made this uneducated (I walked up to the car and it said looks pretty, I want that one) choice I made with my Mitsubishi Mirage.  The car has never stalled or left me stranded anywhere.  I have cold air and warm heat.  This car is definitely the best purchase I have ever made and I have no doubts that my next car will be a Mitsubishi.
