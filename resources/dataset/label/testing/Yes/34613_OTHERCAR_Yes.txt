            I bought my Legacy in May of 1999. It was my third car, but I like to think of it as my first...it was the first car I owned(my last 2 vehicles were Jeeps), it was the first car I chose myself, and it was the first time I had a brand new car. 
There were a couple different aspects that made me choose this car. I live in a little town, one of those that many people refer to as a &quot;hick town&quot;. The roads don't get plowed right away and I needed something that was all wheel drive to make traveling while it was snowing possible. I also wanted something was going to be a little sporty and a great ride in the summer. 
Fortunately, I was able to get all those major needs and wants in one car. I also got my cup holders and a sunroof.....the two things I turned down many other cars for. I was also very fortunate to get the 30th Anniversary Edition - 4EAt package. This package consisted of the Subaru carpet set, mud flaps, custom exhaust tip, and a rear cup holder. 
When I test drove this car I fell in love with it. It was comfortable, the CD/cassette/radio sounded great, and there was plenty of room. I like how the back seats fold down completely.....I snowboard and having that room is great! I have also driven to New York and took this car on vacation with me to Virginia Beach. It drove for 15 hours strait from NH and back again and it doesn't seem like I went anywhere. The last thing I love about this car is the color. I was able to get a limited edition color--whinestone. 
This car is great all year round and for everything. It looks great, it's easy to maintain, and it's affordable.
