            I got this car as a graduation gift from college because I was going to need a set of wheels to get around during my next years of med school and residency. The Toyota Corrola has performed its job perfectly:

-- I always get 30 or more miles to the gallon.
-- It is more than comfortable for my rides, including longer road trips.
-- It easily fits four average size people very comfortably.
-- It allows me to park in narrow spots instead of aimlessly wondering       around city blocks to find a spot. 

The Corrola has been a great starter car for me. I recommend it based on the value the Toyota has afforded me. The standard features plus the added car alarm makes me feel safe plus comfortable with my decision for the Corolla. <br><br>
