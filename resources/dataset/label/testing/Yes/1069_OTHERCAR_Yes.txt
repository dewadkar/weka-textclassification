            I had to replace my Jaguar XJ6 with a 4-wheel vehicle when I moved to 8,000 feet altitude in the mountains.  And I hated to do so.  But now I am finding that with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, it has been a pleasant experience.  

I was surprised that it handled and drove so much like a passenger car.  I had been used to driving the Jag and my son's Stealth and both were a dream to drive.  I expected an abrupt shift to a rough, difficult to curve and corner SUV.  The Grand Cherokee proved me wrong.  It takes the mountain curves very well and I can maintain the same speed I had in my car.

I was new to the mountains and wanted to try some of the remote mountain roads which lead to old mining towns and fantastic scenery.  Only a few days after buying the Jeep I made my first foray to one of these sites.  With a bit of trepidation, I started up the first rough, rocky trail.  The Jeep took the road with no hesitation.  I was amazed that I reached some of the locations considering the condition of the roads.  But what a reward - awesome views of snow covered mountains and forest.  And untouched historical sites that made me believe I was back in the 1800s.  Without such a reliable and sturdy vehicle I never would have attempted these types of roads.

The only thing I consider a downside about this vehicle is that it gets even worse gas mileage than my Jag did.  But I find this a small price to pay for all of the fun and and comfort it offers.

For adventure, comfort and security, buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee!<br><br>
