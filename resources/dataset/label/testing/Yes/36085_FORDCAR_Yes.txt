            When you buy this car you need to focus on the tire warranty. This seems to be the weakest point of this car. When you go and try to use the warranty they give you nothing but the run a round. My daughter had a flat tire at work, she called the motor club they changed the tire but that's all they did. They left us hanging. So we went back to the dealer where they told us to go to the tire dealer. But they would not replace it. So we called the corporate headquarters of Goodyear. They told that in the papers it said that if the car had less than 2000 miles it would be replaced for free. So we went back to the tire dealer. They still would not replace it. We had to physically show that it was a defect. So we put a nail through it and slashed it to prove it. that's when they started to listen to us. We still had to kick and scream a little but it worked. So we got a new tire. We should not have had to go through much trouble. The moral is to stay persistant and you will get what you want.<br><br>
