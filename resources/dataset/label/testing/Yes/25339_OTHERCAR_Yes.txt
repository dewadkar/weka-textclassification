            Bought this car 2 years ago, 2 years old with only 6,000 miles on it.  Have driven nearly problem free for 40,000 miles and several long road trips.  Mine is the LS model with 2.5L V6, leather, and moonroof.  Moonroof hasn't been used yet this summer due to a faulty motor which I haven't yet bothered to fix.  Other than that and a dash warpage problem due to design flaw (and fixed under warranty)I have few complaints.  It's not the coolest car on the road, but I'm still surprised now and then at how good it can look (aside from the truly terrible solid rear tail light). I average close to 25 mpg with a combination of fairly aggressive city/highway driving.  I'm at almost 45,000 miles and still have the original tires and brakes.  Road noise and rear seat room leave a little to be desired, but acceleration and handling are excellent for its class.  This car seems to get a bad rap, and the fact that its resale value is so low just means that I'll drive it for a couple more years and enjoy it for what it is.
