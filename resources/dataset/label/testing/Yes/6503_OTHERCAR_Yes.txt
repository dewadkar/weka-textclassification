            I've been feeling destitute since my Kodak DX3600 was stolen from me at the county fair last month.  It had photos of my son with his Grand Champion lamb.  I hope somebody else gets as much enjoyment from it as I did.

This was my first digital camera when I bought it last March.  I also bought a 128 mp flashcard which allowed me to take over 800 standard or over 200 "best" quality photos.  It just felt so good to shoot unlimited photos and not worry about developing costs.  The camera hooked up easily to my computer by USB cable and the photos downloaded quickly.  I then could name the photos one by one, crop them, or give them a few special effects.  

The first thing I discovered was that I needed a case for my new camera.  After dropping it a couple times and banging it around I decided a $5.00 case from Walmart was worth the investment for my new $279.00 toy.  

My first disappointment was indoor pictures.  Any subjects beyond the 10 foot flash range turned out very dark and grainy.  And don't even try the movie feature in low light -- it turns out totally black, even up close.  The shutter speed is also pretty slow, although if you press the button down halfway (allowing it to focus) then you can snap a shot instantly.  But this requires a little premeditation.  

Other than that, I had a grand time with my camera during the months I still owned it.  I have hundreds of great photos saved on my computer, categorized and easy to retrieve (unlike my snapshots).  I've place a bunch of them on my website.  Check them out, if you wish at my family website:  http://webpages.charter.net/forbiggs/
The movies turned out fairly good, given plenty of light.  Just don't turn the camera sideways -- you can't right it later.  I also wish the movies were MPEG format instead of Quicktime.

What's next?  After reading a lot of user reviews of all different models, I've decided to stick with Kodak.  I just ordered the Kodak DX4330.  It's suppose to be similar to the 3600 but with more and better features -- and better photos in dim light.  So, we'll see.  You can read my review next month.
