            This camera does 2.1 Megapixels. Yet epinions listed it under as a max resolution of 1.9 Megapixels. But the camera is much better than that. With this camera you can take an 8x10 with it. Put a 35mm camera next to it. Take an 8x10 with the 35mm and you won't be able to tell the difference. That's the great thing about high resolution cameras. I like the fact that Sony let's you do mini-movies with mono-sound up to 15 seconds at a time. Also there is a setting to email movies. If you want to use this camera as a web cam you can do so if you have a capture card in your computer. The lens is fixed meaning there is no true zoom capabilities. It has a digital zoom feature but this is pointless if your wanting what you zoomed in on to be at a high resolution. But it's there if you think you need it. It makes a great View shot camera and a great close up camera. The only thing that disappoints me if that with this camera you us a serial link to pull pictures into the pc. However you can purchase a PCMICA card that reads the memory sticks or you can buy the VIAO computer that comes with it built in. Of course I don't recommend buying a computer just for that. Also Sony introduced a Floppy converter for reading memory sticks. Which is all good but your still limited to the speed of a Floppy Disk. With the Digital Camcorders Sony uses these memory sticks and gives the customer a stick reader that plugs into the parallel port.Also some of the newer digital cameras from Sony offer a direct link to USB which solves all those problems. But this camera is not that expensive right now. If you don't mind the short comings this is a great buy. Of course if you have the money and plan to use the camera a lot it's worth getting a newer Sony with the USB port. <br><br>
