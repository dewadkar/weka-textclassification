            I bought this car in Feb. 1998. It was my first dependable (I hoped) used car. It has not let me down. It runs as well now as it did when I first got it, and I've put over 40,000 miles on it (it had 41,000 when i got it, so now it's over 82,000 miles). I've had only one major mechanical problem. The front axle went bad in late 1999 and had to be replaced, but since that work was done, it hasn't acted up again.
I just change the oil and fluids every 3000 miles, and it just keeps going and going.
This Protege is comfortable and is pretty spacious for a little compact.
the body style isn't great -- the older Proteges and and newer ones look better I think, but that's just a minor concern. 
as for safety, it has dual airbags, and recently proved to be tougher than I expected. I was broadsided on the driver's side by an Acura Integra (fortunately not going very fast), and the Protege held up well. the driver's side door shells had to be replaced, but I felt pretty safe.
It's a little underpowered, but it's got enough kick if you need it. it's also handles well enough, although the steering is a little looser than I'd like.
And gas mileage is wonderful (over 30 mpg highway, a little less in the city.)

If you're in the market for a compact, you should give the Protege a chance. it's a great value, it's very dependable, and it's an inexpensive car to own.
