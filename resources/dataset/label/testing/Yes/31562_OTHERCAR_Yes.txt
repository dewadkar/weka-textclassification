            My husband bought me my first Volvo in 1983,it was a 1979 240 wagon.  I drove my wagon for ten years and put 350,000 miles on it.  I used it like a truck and when I sold it in 1993, it still had the compression of a new car!  

I've also owned a 1983 240 sedan which I put 250,000 miles on and now own a 1986 760 sedan with sun and moon roof, heated seats and all the luxuries.  I only have 150,000 miles on that car so it is still just a baby.  

I would highly recommend a Volvo to anyone as they make you feel safe being on the roads.  They are extremely reliable vehicles.  Their turning ability is great, you can turn on a dime and still get change!<br><br>
