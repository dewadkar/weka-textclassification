            I bought a '95 Lumina LTZ in March of 1998 and still own it. I suppose I'm overly loyal to it simply because it's the first car I bought, but it's tough not to love it.
The car is a Lumina. The only real differences are subtle, 16&quot; alloy wheels and the two mufflers in back. While they look identical, I have to agree with the reviewer of the Z34 Lumina-- you can't really compare the two cars. I test drove a base (3.1 liter V6) before trying mine and was less than impressed. The car was a tight squeeze at 6'3&quot; and boring to drive. I came back to the dealership wanting to try out something else. Thankfully, the dealer pointed out the LTZ.
Having said that, let me get the one huge downside out of the way before I mention the pros: the car is expensive to own. Repairs included the master cylinder and a pair of glazed over back brakes, a cracked evaporator in the a/c, and an exhaust leak. Anything and everything with the engine is expensive as one of the reviewers mentioned. The engine has to be dropped to be worked on, so labor costs are always nice and high.
As expensive as it is, I can't get rid of it yet. I can't think of another car in its price class that I could fit comfortably into and have half as much fun. Like the Spanish Inquisition, no one expects some clown in a Lumina to beat them off the line. Here in New Hampshire where locals go out of their way to make it clear &quot;Drive Courteously&quot; is a joke, the LTZ is quick enough to teach every lose every SUV on the highway. The handling is competent, with a bit too much bodyroll for my tastes, but in straight lines out of a toll booth, it doesn't matter much. I've never gotten within a thousand RPMs of the 7,000 redline, but I've never needed to; the car can lose anything but a true sports car well before it comes to that.
