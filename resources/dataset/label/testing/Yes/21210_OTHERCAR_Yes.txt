            The Kodak Easy Share DX4330 Digital Camera was given to me as a gift for the holidays, and I can count the number of minutes it's left my side since then on one hand!  The Easy Share system is really one of Kodak's most remarkable camera systems to date.  It's economical -- family members spent less than $300 on my camera and docking system -- and it produces high quality color pictures that you'll love sharing with everyone.
I love how easy it is to use this camera -- you literally point and snap, simple as that.  The LCD screen allows you to view your picture in daylight or near darkness, and you can delete one or all of your photos with the hit of a button -- you can also choose to protect your photos so they cannot be erased that quickly, a great feature if you spend any time with children who are curious about what those buttons do!  This camera comes with zoom, automatic flash, and an easy magnifying feature that you can use to view magnified versions of your photos on the actual LCD screen.  It also includes several picture-taking options depending on what environment you find yourself in -- one for close-ups, one for nighttime, one for landscapes, etc.  Plain old automatic is also an option if you are a novice (like me).
I read several reviews of digital cameras before I requested this specific one and I really did not believe it could be as easy to use as everyone else out there seems to think, but it's no joke -- you can't mess up with this thing!  It's so self-explanatory and simple to use that no matter where you are you can trust you'll be able to capture striking images of whatever is around you.  There is also a 60-second video feature that allows you to videotape a full minute of action, with audio!
The model I received came with a docking station and the Easy Share software -- the software took less than five minutes to completely install, and the docking station is a dream.  Your camera recharges automatically once you place it in the docking station, so you can always be ready to take quality photos wherever you go.  To transfer pictures onto your computer you simply place the camera into the docking station, hit the big button, and THAT'S IT.  Pictures transferred, all ready for you to play with the fun features the software has!  You can rotate pictures, eliminate red-eye, crop and size, enhance quality, adjust the brightness, turn your color photo into black and white (or even a brown sephia tone), the list is endless!
One minor setback -- battery life is not so hot for this piece of otherwise flawless equipment.  I would highly recommend that you keep a spare set of charged batteries on hand for long excursions when you think you might be taking a lot of pictures.  
I'm sure professional photographers or those aspiring to become pros could nitpick about little features this camera lacks, but for the novice who just wants to take some really gorgeous pictures without the hassle, this is the ideal camera!
