             Mom's taxi is a blue 1995 Dodge Caravan. I bought this van used after my other taxi-a Ford Escort Wagon-became more of a burden than a luxury.

 This van has a lot of room. Gone are the days of "Mom, he's touching me," or the famous "I want the window this time-you had it last time bubby". Our van has 2 long seats in the back. Now if I transport 4 children, each child can sit by a window.

 Speaking of transporting, we go to Ohio about once a month. This van has so much room, that we are able to have 4 suitcases and yet each child still has enough room to stretch out and sleep on the way. Also, the back seats have cupholders built in. This has been a life saver many, many times. There is even a place under the cup holders to put snacks or small items. Once again, this has come in very handy for not only trips, but on a daily basis.

 Our sliding door has a child safety lock. I like this feature because I know now that the children will not be able to just jump out of the van whenever they feel like. Like most families, I have very excited children who would sometimes jump out of the car when we merely slowed down but the engine was not turned off. That is cured now. And guess what- I don't have to ruin it by telling them again not to get out until the car has been turned off completely. With the child safety lock, they automatically have to wait for me because the door can only be opened from the outside. (they hate this feature).

  All seats are very soft and comfortable. The seats are easy to clean. The driver's seat and the passenger seat can both be reclined to an almost laying down position.

  My only complaint is that shortly after we purchased this van, the passenger side fender began to slip back until the passenger side door would not open all the way. The fender literally slipped under the door opening. Because our vehicle was bought used I am not sure if this is a manufacturer's defect or if our van had previously been wrecked. The fender is fiberglass though, and bends with the weight of the door.
  
 The second thing I would say is that the van gets good gas mileage until it hits about 1/2 a tank then it turns into a gas hog. But this is only in city driving-lots of stop and go-not highway miles. On the highway, it gets excellent gas mileage.

 Would I buy this again? Most definetly.
