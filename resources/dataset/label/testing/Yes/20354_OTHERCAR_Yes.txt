            I love my sunbird. I have a blue '91 automatic with a four cyl fuel injected engine, it's way better on gas than the V6. I'm a student, and with today's gas prices fuel economy is important. I've had no problems with mine whatsoever. Mine has 74,000 km's on it, which is pretty light driving. I plan on switching to japanese before it hits 150, not because I don't like it, but eventually something WILL go wrong with it, it's american. 

I customized my bird up the yingyang though. Panasonic cd deck, alpine mono channel amp, 12&quot; MTX sub in the trunk, sony combo kit for speakers. I put clear tail lights in, and tinted the headlights blue. I also replaced the crappy stock goodyear tires with Michelins.

A great car for the money, excellent economic 4 Cyl., or a gutsy V6.<br><br>
