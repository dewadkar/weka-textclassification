            I bought this Sony digital camera because of it's ease of use and it's storage media. 

If you consider the fact that most cameras use &quot;smart media&quot; cards this camera uses standard 3 1/2&quot; floppy disks. This enables you to pull out a disk when it's full and pop in a new one. &quot;Smart media&quot; cards have to be downloaded and if you are on vacation without your laptop you are in trouble. 

The pictures are sharp and the special effects are spectacular. You can change your image to black and white, sepia or even solarize it. What a camera !!!! I used to be a dyed in the wool 35mm camera user but now I can't imagine using anything other than digital. 

The initial investment could be considered pricey depending on which model you choose but when you consider that you no longer have to send your pictures out to de developed at a cost of $8 - $10 a roll you can imagine what you will save over the long run. This camera is &quot;point and shoot&quot; so you don't have to have great technical knowledge to use it and you can also record moving images onto a floppy disk for viewing later. 

I can't think of anyone who shouldn't buy one of these cameras   <br><br>
