            Let's start out by saying that I haven't found anything wrong with this truck yet.  I bought this vehicle to update my old 1991 Sierra.  One of the things that liked about the new Sierra is that it has a tow/haul button on it, my old one didn't and I do a lot of haul livestock and within a year I burnt out the old Transmission in my 1991 Sierra.  The turning ratio has also improved since my old truck, which I greatly appreciate since I got myself into several tricky spots since I couldn't turn as sharp as I needed to.  There is plenty of leg room as well as over all room for people to sit comfortable in the front seats.  I still don't like how the back seat is in the extended cab, if you have to make a long trip sitting back there you just can't do it.  I bought the truck with lots of things added on which I thought were necessary for it for two reasons. 1)  It gives the truck a better feeling, better handling and comfort.  2)  It just looks better that way.  This truck is for just about anyone, since it comes in two or four wheel drive,  but I don't see why all the city people want trucks, I guess it's because you feel much safer in a big truck than a compact car.  Overall I think that this is the best truck that's out there for anyone to buy.<br><br>
