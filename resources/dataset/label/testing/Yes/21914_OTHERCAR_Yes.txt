               Almost every car brings to mind an opinion about its performance and overall desirability.  Many people that have not driven the Nissan Sentra come to the conclusion that it is undesirable, yet those that have driven it usually think the opposite.
   
   This car has many positive aspects, including its cost.  It is relatively inexpensive considering the amount of car you get.  
   
   The 1.6 liter in line 4-cylinder engine is peppy and easy to rev.  It has Dual Over Head Camshafts, 16 Valves, and Fuel Injection.  These features make the engine more powerful and more economical than less advanced engines.  It produces 110 hp, and 108 ft-lbs of torque.  This seems like a meager amount compared to many larger cars, but when this engine is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission it is more than enough power.  In fact, the 2300 lb Sentra gets from 0 to 60 mph in only 9.2 seconds.  The irony is that a 1993 Mazda Miata has a 0 to 60 time of 9.4 seconds, even though it is classified as a "sports car".  I am a driving enthusiast, and I can easily take corners at 25 mph with very little body roll.  I don't normally drive like that though, and under normal conditions, the suspension is stiff but comfortable enough.  The 5-speed is easy to operate, and definitely adds a sporty feel to the little car.
   
   Another great aspect is the gas-mileage.  I normally get about 30 mpg in town and 36 mpg on the highway.  Even if I drive the car rather fast, the gas mileage still stays high.  The best part of having the 1.6 liter engine is that you can get plenty of power and still keep a economical edge over bigger engines. 
   
   The styling is also very positive.  The outside of the car is simple but not bare-bones.  It has classy styling that gives it a much better appearance than most economy cars from the same era.  The inside is simple as well, but ergonomic enough to make it comfortable.  The dash layout is great, despite the lack of a Tachometer in the XE model.  The seats are comfortable in front, and there is considerable leg and head room.  I am 6 feet tall and do not have any trouble fitting in the car.  The back seat is somewhat small, but it is fine for adults on short trips.
   
   The quality of the car is also great.  I have had an excellent driving experience from the car after 1 1/2 years of ownership.  The car has a relatively small amount of road noise and it feels solid.  Interior parts are mainly plastic, but they are of high build quality.  Buttons feel solid and are laid out well.
   
   Overall, I love my Sentra.  It fits my needs perfectly and makes me enjoy driving.  Every time I start it up I cannot wait to rev the wonderful engine.  It is not a sports car, but its handling characteristics make it a joy to drive.  Add in the excellent gas mileage, reliability and overall ride quality and you have an excellent car for the money.  The only cons are that some people do not like small cars and these people usually do not like 4 cylinder engines either.  My experience, though, is that the Sentra is a well balanced car that is good for all types of drivers.  It is sporty and fun, yet economical and reliable at the same time.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone.
