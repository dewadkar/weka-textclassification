            We have only had our car for 3 days, we had a dodge caravan for 6 years before that. I am 5ft and between the pedals I can adjust and the power driver seat, it is not 'if' I can find a comfortable position but 'which' comfortable position I want to use. We have the almost fully loaded SEL wagon. My husband is paralized on one side it is hard for him to get in and out of cars. He has no problem with this car. My daughter is 21 and says it does not look or feel like a wagon. Maybe Ford could think of more color choices, and haveing an op. of a moonroof would be nice, I really had my heart set on one never having one before.
I have not had it long enough to know of any problems. It is a nice smooth ride on our mt.  roads.(I live in the mt's of north Ga.)

I have had this car for 3 months now. Still no real problems. I would like better gas mileage but no car is great in that area. I drive mostly within 5 miles from home at about 20 mph. about twice a month I drive in the curvy somtimes steep mt's to walmart ,a 35 min. drive.
My bigest gripes are that the storage, other then the glove comp, are useless. They are way to small for anything other then a few pens. ( I need a good , easy to get to, place to store at least ONE cd soft wallet (25 cd's)).
And if the center console top were flat,rather then rounded, I could put my purse there when someone is riding in the front. I am a bit on the heavy side so it would be nice if the driver seat were a little wider( the car would need to be a tad wider also)and the seat was more built up/padded also.It is hard for me to adjust the seat as I need to open the door just a bit to  get to the switch (someone thinner should not have this problem),Also it would be nice if the left foot rest would come out with the pedals as my left foot/leg gets tired.
Other then that, I still love the car.
