            I have a 1998 Red Jeep Wrangler, and I love it! Equipped with both hard and soft tops, AC, 4wd,good stereo.  
One of the first things i noticed driving around Philadelphia and the suburbs, is people &quot;waving&quot; at me in other Jeeps. Its not really a wave, your left hand is on the wheel, (right hand on the stick) and they lift up their fingers , keeping their wrist on the wheel, briefly acknowledging me, a fellow Jeep owner, this I call the Jeep wave, like i am apart of the club. At first I never waved first, feeling stupid, now i find myself doing it with ease, It actually puts a smile on my face.  Is it like this all over the country??? I don't know, but it is in the Philadelphia area.
It feels great to take the top down and drive around. At first that was a little hard to do, but after the third time, I can get the top on or off in 3 minutes. This was one of the main reasons for purchasing the Jeep.  With all the snow we get here in the winter time, I wanted the jeep for its huge tires and 4wd.  What a pleasure it is to drive in the winter time now, not worried that I will slide, or get stuck. Sure its a bumpy ride snow or not, and its only got 4 cylinders,on a 5 speed, so I can't go much more than 70 mph, and yes it is noisy. I still love it.
