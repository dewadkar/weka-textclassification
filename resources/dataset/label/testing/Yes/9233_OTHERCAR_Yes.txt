            I bought a 2000 Subaru Impreza wagon in April of this year.  I hadn't intended to buy this car, I wanted a Chrysler PT Cruiser.  But once I saw the car and then drove the car, I knew this was the car for me.  

First of all, even though it is a compact, it is very roomy inside.  Even my husband, who is over 6'2&quot; says that it is roomy.  I bought the standard rather than the automatic and, I have to say, it feels like a sports car.  

It is very responsive and has great pick-up.  The all wheel drive makes me feel very safe and has served me well so far.  The car is also sporty looking.  

Everyone who gets inside comments on how nice a car it is.  I wanted a small car but one that had enough room for my growing family, and this car certainly fits the bill.  I like the fact that it is a wagon but is small enough for a short person, 5'2&quot; at my tallest, to feel comfortable in.  

The only thing that I don't like about the car is that its suspension is a little tight (this after having driven German cars for years.)  When you hit bumps, you know that you have hit a bump.  

This vehicle is a pleasure to drive.  Everything on the dash is within easy reach.  There are 2 cup holders and other storage spaces for various things.  The glove box is large enough to hold maps.  The steering is very responsive and I feel like I have complete control over the car, even under poor driving conditions.  The model that I bought has a roof rack, which has come in very handy for transporting the junk that a young family needs to travel with.  This car is the best car I have ever owned and I would definitely buy one again.

I suggest that anyone who is of smaller stature but wants the room of a wagon or to feel like they have a larger car, consider this one.  Also, anyone of any size who wants a compact, sporty but practical car should take a test drive.<br><br>
