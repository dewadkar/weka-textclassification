            We bought our J30t because it was luxurious without being too big, very cleanly styled, excellent acceleration, functional without a zillion gadgets, and quiet. Now, 4 years and 60,000 miles later, we still like it a lot. It has never required repair except for brake relining. Mileage is as advertised (18/23). The engine uses little oil. The transmission is very smooth. The stereo is terrific. It's very comfortable both in town and on the road. I wish it cornered a bit better, the engine can be a bit buzzy under hard acceleration, and it would be nice to have a larger trunk. If I crashed it, I'd probably go out and get another one.<br><br>
