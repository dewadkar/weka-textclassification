            If you are reading this now, you are looking at a 99 Continental, you will be buying used like me. You probably already know what an incredible steal you are getting. A 275 horsepower front wheel drive luxury machine for under $18,000, sometimes still under warranty.

I waited a year to write the review on Matilda (her name like the British tank) so that I could give a great Epinion. For the most part I&#146m really impressed. The adjustable suspension works wonders. I drive Denver to Boulder every day set at &#147normal&#148 on steering and &#147plush&#148 on the suspension. Every weekend I drive to Breckenridge and love going &#147high&#148 and &#147tight&#148 in the mountains. 

The power is incredible. I never thought my old man car would have as much passing power because of its 3800lb weight. That little Ford V8 really gets up and moves. I can punch 20mph on top of highway speeds to pass in a few seconds. You can feel the whole car jump.

I love the leather, the garage door opener, the seat controls are brilliant. It has a good glasses holder, cup holders in the back seat are good. 

I have had a few problems. Check the maintenance bulletins for your car. A few months before mine was produced they had a fuel line problem which Lincoln of course fixes for free. My steering went out two times. I had trouble getting Silterhar at the Broomfield exit to take care of it and had to go back again. They replaced the power steering pump and the entire steering rack. Now I go to the wonderful dealer in Denver. 

My other issues are with the analog clock, the front drink holders and the stereo. It has a super high tech holographic display, a digital stereo and climate controls and then a stupid analog clock that moves only once every 3 minutes. The cupholders in the front don&#146t let you move the shifting lever. I have found this at some dangerous times and don&#146t use it anymore. They also don&#146t hold any cup I ever get without spilling it. The stereo is just terrible considering it is supposed to be &#147top of the line.&#148 My friends $1000 Sony setup mocks my stereo every time I hear it. I think my &#147Alpine Premium&#148 speakers must be made of paper. Try finding a deck that looks ok in this car too. It&#146s impossible. 

With the controls on the steering wheel for stereo (and cruise and climate) it ends up worth dealing with a mediocre stereo. 

Overall I love this car. It&#146s traction control and ABS handle well in my weekend snow driving. It&#146s a dream on my daily commute. I&#146ve put 45,000 miles on so far and she&#146s $18,500 fully loaded from Lincoln. This car has everything Lincoln offered down to the run flat tires and I got it in 2002 for 18.5. I highly recommend this as a used car. 

Also check Consumer Reports and Edmunds. You will see from a million sources that this car is amazing.
