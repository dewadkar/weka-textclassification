            The model of Ranger I have driven is a 1999 XLT regular cab 4x2 with the off road/lift kit from the factory.  Keep in mind that I do not own this truck, but do drive it extensively in all types of conditions since my work involves the use of a fleet of these vehicles.  I have made short 5 minute trips around the city as well as two hour interstate commutes in these trucks, so I can safely say that I know them pretty well.

Styling on the Ranger is pretty slick.  I love how Ford kept it simple and did not over do it with cheesy moldings and chrome galore.  The clean lines and all business look is great!  The front end could be better though.  It was a bad idea to simple change the front facia and tail lamps from earlier model Rangers and describe the truck as a refreshed model.  The twin turn signal flashers under the headlamps seem a little too much.  Having 2 bulbs flash on each side of a truck so small SCREAMS that it is small!  Otherwise, I can�t complain at all.  

The interior is very functional!  Ford went the el cheapo route hear because every material used inside looks and is cheap!  The plastic on the door panels, dash, and controls is already starting show age by becoming dry and course.  I have a feeling that these materials will be destroyed when the UV light of summertime hits them.  As far as seats
go, they are very comfortable!  My trucks have a split bench seat with the armrest that doubles as a storage bin and coin holder.  Long commutes are a joy in these seats!  My back has never ached and my legs have never cramped up after sitting for over 4-5 per day.  

As far as controls and such go, they almost all work wonderfully.  The radio has large easy to use buttons and sounds pretty nice for a stock truck system.  Stereo sound is not reproduced with precision because you don�t experience that �echo and jump�, but it�s always been distortion free and clear.  I must also note that the way fingers fall perfectly to
the preset buttons when driving with your  hand on the gear shift knob is impressive.  The climate control system works well and has quality feeling switches to it.  However, I do not like how the a/c must be operated by rotating a switch.  Had Ford built in an a/c button, like Toyota does, it would make it much easier to concurrently operate the heater and front widow defogger.   Another problem area is the windshield wiper system.  Rather than designing a stalk that allows the driver to choose intermittent or continuous wiping by moving the stalk to two locations, the stalk forces you to twist through the various intermittent speeds before reaching continuous wiping.  The way they have about 6-8
intermittent speeds is plain stupid!  Toyotas have a better design where 1 of 4 intermittent speeds is selected on the stalk and the driver moves the whole stalk to get delayed wiping or hi or low continuous wiping.  

The outside rear view mirrors are also very poorly designed.  I suggest you either get one of those adhesive blind spot circles like I did or better yet, rip them off and install large after market mirrors.  The stock units look super cheap and offer a tiny glimpse of what is
on the sides of your truck.  Blind spots are huge with them.

Driving the Ranger is great except when it rains and when you are on highways where the pavement is damaged.  In the rain, the rear end seems to fishtail quite a bit.  First gear starts usually result in wheelspin even if you are careful not to over rev the motor while slowly releasing the clutch.  In fact, I had a co-worker spin the truck starting out in second gear after I had warned him of the problem in first.  In addition to this, the truck has a tendency to kind of float above the ground when it goes over a bump at speed over 45 mph.  On the freeway, a small bump can cause the rear end to land an inch or two parallel to where the front wheels are.  This is a HUGE safety risk.  For a micro second, the truck
feels completely out of control.  However, I have never had these close calls turn into incidents.  In fact, other drivers on the road seem not to notice because the control loss is not enough to cause you to go out of your lane.  I imaging the raised suspension is the culprit.  For you people who do a lot of highway driving, you�d probably be better off
with the standard suspension.  Vibration and rattle are also pretty severe at 60+ mph with is set up.  

The 2.5 engine is a gem!  Some of our Rangers have racked up over 150K miles in less than 14 months and they are still running strong.  We�ve never had breakdowns or even engine stalling.  The motors also pull very well even when there is about 800 pounds of cargo in the bed.  Low end torque is enough to creep in traffic w/o having to use the accelerator pedal.

Overall, I�d say the Ranger is a good buy and I�d recommend it.  Ford needs to make a few minor changes to make the truck perfect.  Maybe a different spring and shock combination will allow the raised body style to be more stable.  Also, the small things like the wiper controls and a/c button need to be addressed.  To anyone looking to buy one of
these, I do not suggest you get a used one when a new Ranger is so affordable.  Ours were purchased for $13,500 with am/fm cassette, a/c, chrome bumpers, chrome wheels, and off road kit.  Used trucks tend to be a gamble since you face getting into an abused machine that looks nice.  A better used truck buy would be the Mazda B series because it
is essentially a Ranger, but is rarely used by companies as fleet work trucks (when compared to Ranger).<br><br>
