            The most solid, comfortable and sporty car I have ever owned.  Mine is currently at the dealer for its 35k checkup and I miss it very much.  (I have to drive a clumsy '88 Pathfinder until I get it back.)  I bought it for the style and the safety, but I love it for the performance and the ease of driving.  I would always buy a Saab with a stick shift.  After 42k miles only problems are from the tires and the battery.  Great snow car.  Fits 5 comfortably.  Good limousine for my Golden Retriever.  Great stereo.  I don't have a turbo charger but am very satisfied with the acceleration.  I would have gotten a convertible, but wanted a solid roof for ski/bike racks.  The weight of the car makes for a solid feel and great handling.  I drive through the Presidio in San Francisco and all over Marin County and up to Tahoe all the time and love it!<br><br>
