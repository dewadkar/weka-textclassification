            I have a 95 model and at times I love it and other times I hate it.
I have 3 kids and was dating a man that had 2 so I go a van. The way mine is set up there is 2 seats then 3 then 2. I love my van but when you have a full load you have to move the one seat down and then back over and over.  If I had it to do over I would get the one with 2 seats in the middle.
Another thing I dislike is when you go somewhere shopping there is not a lot of room in the back to put stuff if all the kids are with you.
As for the driving of this spaceshuttle of mine I LOVE IT...It drives like a dream but I do want to warn you that I was in a wreck where I was rear ended and the cost was to be about $4000 in damage and it turned out to be almost 7000.  Not to many of the places here work on the fiberglass vehicles so it was hard to find a good price..and once they started looking they found more damage than they had thought in the wiring.
