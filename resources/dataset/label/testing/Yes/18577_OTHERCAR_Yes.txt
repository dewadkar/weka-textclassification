            I bought this Jimmy instead of a van. It is perfect for my needs. I can lay the seat in back, down for larger items &amp; leave the window hatch open also. The window wiper motors were recalled &amp; replaced in 15 minutes. And a seatbelt was recalled and also replaced in 15 minutes. It runs like a top &amp; gets decent mileage. It gets about 18 miles to the gallon-city driving. I basically just get the oil&amp; necessary fluids changed &amp; go! It is a 94 &amp; is (knock on wood) doing great. I bought it new &amp; would recommend searching for a used 94' to anyone. We now have 2 kids and it has plenty of leg room &amp; the necessary room in between a sister &amp; brother. I also love the ceiling console with the direction &amp; temperature.<br><br>
