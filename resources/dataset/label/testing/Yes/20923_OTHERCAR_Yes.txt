            I have the pleasure of seeing people driving these vehicles around town..with that &quot;hey everyone look at me and my wheels&quot; type grin.  It makes me sick! A relative had one on order, and when he got it invited me over to check it out.  I must say this thing is the most HIDEOUS thing i've seen - i'm almost convinced the name was supposed to be the PT Hurst..haha!  I understand that people like a retero look, but this thing is so UGLY!  I would be embarrassed to be seen in this thing.

Okay now you know how i feel on the styling.  Chrysler is known for making very qualitly vehicles, and although i dislike the styling VERY MUCH on the PT CRUISER, after carefull examination it seems to be a well built machine.  I would predict it to be very reliable - although, i'm usually weary of the 1st year of a new vehicle..because they almost always seem to have problems with are worked on in the next few years models.

The performance is lacking, the engine and transmission just dont pull this big guy around like they should.  I think chrysler should of beefed up the PT cruiser alot more...its a big slugish vehicle - not somethin' i'd want for heavy duty big city traffic.

The styling also contributes to some sacrifices such as a handfull of really horrible blind spots (thinking back to my comment on big city traffic...ouch! blindspots are bad news!.)  An experienced driver that is aware of the blind spots should have no problems driving it safely though.

Even though i am disgusted with the looks of the PT Cruiser, i will give a huge thumbs up to Chrysler for making such a unique vehicle. And because of that and the quality ..i will reccomend it. <br><br>
