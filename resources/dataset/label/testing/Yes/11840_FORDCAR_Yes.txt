            Here I am 6 years later Driving my  silver Ford Taurus. I have yet to ever need to be towed because I've broken down or anything. I feel so safe on the road and I have an incredible turn radius.  I can fit all three of my babies (ages 17 months to 5 years) in the back seat safely and securely.  I get great miles per gallon on the gas.  There is so much room in the car that my husband and I have driven it from Kentucky to Pennsylvania several times and never felt that the car was to cramped with all the luggage etc.  The trunk space is incredible. I can fit a double stroller and a full weeks worth of groceries in there, and still have room for the diaper bag.  The trunk really is the best part, well besides the engine of course. The car runs really great. and the heat is wonderful in the winter and the A/C is so powerful when it's really hot out in the summer.
