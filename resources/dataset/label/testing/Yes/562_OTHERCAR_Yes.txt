            I bought this my Hyundai because my old car was costing more than it was worth to keep.  I was undecided at first of whether to buy a foreign car or stay with the good old Chevrolet models. I am so glad with the choice I made for this car is a lot more than what I bargained for.  The drive in this car is unbelievable, smooth and easy, almost like gliding across the road.  In addition, the style of the model I got, the GS model, is very sporty.  I can't tell you how many people have commended me on their likeness for the style as well as the features that are in my car.  I am so pleased with its driving, the style I choose, and especially the sports type style.  I almost got scared a few times because I thought for a couple of times I would be pulled over for the car looks almost like a typical sports car.<br><br>
