            I've just picked up a 2003 TJ Sport. In the US they're known as Wranglers. I haven't blown through a full tank of gas in it yet so an up date will follow later on. With that being said, I'll try to give you a low down on what I've found out so far.
Before I decided to buy one, I was able to rent a few (due to hitting a deer with my truck) on my insurance companies tab. One was also a new Liberty. 
This is my second Jeep of this style. My first was an 1980 CJ-7. There is no comparison between the 2. Everything has been changed for the better. The dealership that I dealt with was nice enough to let me take one home for a few days as well.
There were quite a few options that you can add on. Here are some of the ones that I added to my Sport:

30" Canyon tire package - This package comes with 30x9.5" tires and alloy rims. This is basically the same rims on the Sahara models. I found out that there's more to this package than just putting on rims on a Sport. The dealer won't do that. The package comes with the high pressure gas shocks and the 3:73 rear axle ratio. The stock one's on the TJ Sport is 3:07's. This makes the shift points come a lot quicker. You could almost start out in second gear if you wanted to without too much trouble. It kind of reminds me of the old Ford 4 speeds with that stump puller first gear. It sits higher and the ride isn't much different than the stock rims on the Sport. The loaner was a stock TJ Sport while my new one was getting it's PDI done. I'm assuming that the ride difference would be that the Canyon balloon tires off-set the stiffer shocks. The handling is a little different as well. It seems mine is a little more sure footed and not as much body roll with this package. IMHO a well worth add on.

Dual Tops - In Canada, we get a lot of snow and cold here. My TJ had to have this. Also in my neck of the woods, the dealer only orders this package with the full metal doors with the roll up windows. You can get the half doors at dealerships in the states, but up here, it would be a waste. Besides, if you want, you can remove the doors and pick up some after market canvas doors for the summer. There's nothing like cruising with the top down in the summer. the door frame that come with the full doors help the top from letting the elements in. In the winter? I would want to have a hard top for the snow. There is an aftermarket company that also sells a liner to put in the hard top for extra insulation and to avoid the heat loss of the fiberglass roof. The fiberglass roof weights about 140 lbs and was no problem for my girlfriend and I to take off. There is a video that comes with it as well that was very helpful with the instructions on how to do all of this. Insist on getting this video if you purchase it new. If used, ask a fellow TJ owner if you can borrow theirs. As for noise? So far it has been quieter than I would have expected. The new style of top doesn't seem to flap around. It's a new product that Jeep is using now and compared to my old CJ, it's like night and day. This could also be because the top is so new. Time will tell as I use it more and more. Even the road noise is a lot less than I thought or had come to expect from a TJ.

AM/FM CD 7 Speaker System - It's not bad. I'm a little spoiled with my sound systems at home or in my other truck. Not bad for a factory set-up. I would opt for an aftermarket system. I do like the speaker set-up though. The roll bar position for the 2 full range speakers is an great idea. There are 4 speakers in the dash (under the vents), 2 in the roll bar, and the sub woofer is in the center console.Way better than in the pre 97 models. The controls are easy to use and I believe the system puts out 66 watts.

The rest of the options are pretty much self explanatory: tilt, cruise, fog lights, tow hooks, etc.

The TJ has the 4.0 liter straight 6 in it. From what I've read, it's the best to get instead of the 4 cylinder. It seems that they get the same gas mileage and the 4 is under powered. I test drove one and I noticed it when merging into traffic on a highway. The 5 speed transmissions works great. As I mentioned before, with the steeper gears, first and second could have been a little higher for my liking. The shift indicator seem to come on at about 2000 rpm for the first 3 gears and doesn't light until 3200 for 4th. I don't follow it that much but that's what it does? Off road is where 1st gear really shines. The added power of the 6 has more than enough grunt to pull you over, through and around things.
The engine compartment is well laid out and everything is easy to find and work on. ( Of course! It's a Jeep)
The fit and finish from the factory is well done. I have no complaints so far. It also is available with 4 wheel disc brakes. Mine doesn't have it, but the braking power is really good with the disc in the front and drums in the rear. There's no pulling or sudden surprises.
The seats are very comfortable for my girlfriend and I and the kids haven't complained about the backs. I wanted the cloth seats. Cool and not sticky. The comfort and support is there as well. It's no Envoy but good enough for me. The only thing that takes a bit to get use to is the height of the front buckets when your looking to smack one of the kids in the back (Just kidding :)..) They're pretty high and it takes a little to get use to if you want to have a conversation with someone in the back. There is no way you'll get whiplash with the height of these. Full back and neck support. The back seats are another story. They stop at the shoulder blades and if your 4x4ing, rear passengers have to be careful. The shoulder restraints in the back are a nice touch.

The full console has 4 cup holders (2 in front and 2 in the back), I also thought the extra power ports in the dash was a good idea. There are 2. If you order the smoking package for $33 Can., you get this round little covered ashtray that takes up one of your cup holder in front (removable) and a lighter that takes up one of the two power ports in the dash. The power port in the dash I can live with, but the cup holder??? Come on!

There are 2 lockable storage compartments. The glove box and (if you order it) console.
The soft top is quick and easy to put up and down, but the windows are a bit of a challenge. It should get easier as the top loosens up. Trying to find the best place for the windows is a challenge. I found it best to roll up the rear and put it in the straps for it in the top before I lower it and the rear sides between the tail gate and back seat. BTW, the smoked plastic rear windows was a nice touch. Never did like clear in the back due to heat and privacy.

I can't comment on the gas mileage yet.The dealer told me that is would suck for the first 10000 km's. I'm breaking it in easy. For me, it's an improvement over my 94 5.7 liter 4x4 anyhow even if it is new!

It isn't something for everyone. The ride is way better than the older ones. They were kidney bashers. Way more refined and enjoyable. Handling is twitchy at first but you get use to it in a hurry. You'll feel the side winds. There is no storage space if there's more than 2 of you. The back seat folds up to give you enough if there's only 2 of you to worry about. It's great for parking. It look great and is very practical as a second vehicle. You get the convertible in the summer and a proven 4x4 for the winter. The heater in it is way better than they use to be. The rear defrost and wiper with washer is a nice extra. Everything is well laid out and easy to find. Nothing too fancy, just practical and everything else you would need.

All in all, it looks great, best second vehicle you could get for where I live, go anywhere, comfortable for a Jeep, Handles like a mountain goat with no surprises, great brakes, convertible, great heater, and my girlfriend love's it and won't let me take it without her or leave her my truck. 

The bad?? No storage, but you know that going in. Gas mileage?? It doesn't matter. If it does, go get a Honda. This is a rugged go anywhere 4x4. Not a Volvo driving soccer mom mobile. (well it could be I guess?)

You can almost have it all with these. My dealer support has been out of this world. They have done everything I've asked for and more. They can't stop tripping over themselves to make sure that I'm happy with it and them. (Look, any dealership that'll let me take off in one of their Jeeps for a few days while I'm undecided is pretty rare!!)

I hope this review help you decide if you'll like it or not. As you can tell I am. Please keep in mind that the price I put in is in Canadian dollars. I will up dated this at a later date if there's any problems. Feel free to contact me if you have any comments or questions. Just leave a message here.

It's a Jeep!! What more can I say?

Just to up date on what has been going on with the Jeep here on December 7th, 2003. 

I've put on just over 6000km's on it and it's still running like brand new. The windshield took a small chip on the side and has now started a crack about 6 inches long. I didn't see it as the chip hit on the blacked out portion along the side. I guess this is something you may have to contend with due to the windshield being so straight up with no deflection qualities? ( I still can't bring myself to putting on a bug deflector ).

Currently it's getting between 400-500 km's on a full tank of gas. Putting it into 4x4 doesn't seem to really effect the mileage as much as I thought it might. Maybe cutting it down by 50 to 75 km's. Shifts into and out of 4x4 are smooth with no clunks or jerks.

I did, however, have a small problem with getting the convertible top off. Since the dealership put it on, I had to figure out the way it would come off. The factory recommends that you do not install the hard top with the soft top installed. ( Go Figure...lol) Everything was easy and straight forward until you get to the soft top mounts on the roll bar. There are 2 clips on each side that hold the soft top to the roll bar. There is a screw that runs through them to hold it there. The tricky part is trying to get the clips to release. You have to use a flat headed screw drive to pry them apart to get it to release. There is a ridge molded in the middle that will, somewhat, hold the bracket on the roll bar should the screw ever work it's way out. I had to go over the video to make sure that I was doing it right. There is no mention or detail of this. I almost snapped the first one trying to get it off. I'm sure that I'm not the first person to have this problem and I can't see why Jeep wouldn't highlight this in their video or manual? If your reading this and you haven't taken your soft top off, you'll see what I mean and I hope this little tid-bit will save some of you some aggravation.

Other than what I've mentioned above, there hasn't been much change. The fit and finish is still great, with no rattles or knobs coming loose. The only other complaint is trying to find the cup holders in the front when it's dark out. The high dash blocks out most light down by the shifter base which makes it a little tough to find them. A very minor but annoying thing to me. ( Hey! I had to find something didn't I??..lol)

Thanks for your comments. Feel free to write to me if there is anything else you would like to know. I usually check here once a week and will try to answer any questions you may have.
Thanks
