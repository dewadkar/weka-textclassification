            I bought this vehicle for two reasons. First, it is different than anything else on the market. So many time you have to get next to a vehicle to see who made it, not the PT. Second, I thought it was very spacious and fit my needs and budget. I love the styling of the vehicle. I am not intersted in old cars, but the cars rock as far as style. The vehicle stands out in crowded parking lot. Driving the vehicle is cool! 
The only complaint is the power,it needs more ponies under the hood. It is fine while driving down the highway,but getting on the freeway can be difficult at times. The handling is awesome, the interior space is great, and the price is amazing. I think anybody interested should buy this vehicle. The only person who should not purchase this vehicle is someone who is looking for a race car.<br><br>
