I've always marvelled at the elegance of the Accord coupe and though it seems there's so many on the road, I never get tired of looking at them.  So I got one.  And I am a happy driver.  The interior is SO spacious and refined.  200 HP (on the V6) under the hood allows the coupe to perform your every wish.  The responsiveness is incredible and even for a car of it's size, it corners superbly.  The luxuries are pretty much standard Japanese.  Automatic climate (one zone) control, seat warmers, and really quite amazing sound system.  There are a few flaws that I would like to see different but mind you, I will NOT hold it against this vehicle because they are minor.  The sunroof, for one, is large but when opened, doesn't retract all the way back.  Plus I really like the one-touch retraction in the VW's and Audi's but I guess that's what you get with standardised Japanese controls.  The dash is a little too plain looking.  I like the refined look, it's clean but I swear, it's a little too clean sometimes.  It almost reminds me of a mini-van dash.  The wood trim (which I don't have) only covers the audio panel so it's pretty much pointless since the side panels and gear box don't come in it.  NO Accord Coupe winter floor mats.  You either have to buy aftermarket ones or use the ones that come with the Odyssey (or at least that's what the dealer told me).  The only options I'd consider getting on the V6 would be the spoiler and multi-reflector fog lights.  But those two alone come to over $1000 for both (that's Canadian).  But the fog-lights are beautiful.  The body itself has been redesigned from the 2000 model.  The front grill has been made more aggressive looking and the back mouldings have been raised a bit for a more streamlined 'dagger' look.  For a two door sports coupe, this, one is long.  I'd say not as wide as the grand prix, thank goodness, but possibly longer.  Overall, still my favourite car on the road.  In buying this car, I had a few options, the Nissan Xterra, Audi A4 (1.8T). VW Jetta (Wolfsburg), Toyota Solara, and Acura TL.  I chose this one and haven't looked back.

Well, I've had the car for over 2 years now and here's what I think about it now.

Performance
Performance is still the same HOWEVER, I have to note that I get over 500km (310 miles) to the tank now...this started happening after about 40k (about 29000 miles).  Considering the gas prices lately, this was a welcome change.  And it was a gradual change, not all of a sudden.

Maintenance
So far, no major maintenance problems.  I do keep it religiously maintained though - oil changes, tune ups, brakes (once).  Right now, I'm due for my next service which will be to inspect the drive belts...driving right now I can hear the belts more than normal so I think it's almost about time to get those changed.  Also,  I was detailing my car over the weekend and noticed that the driver side seat has a slight tear/hole in the leather.

Two things I had to take the car into the dealership for to have it serviced under warranty:
1) The driver side side-view mirror's electronic controls broke.  They had to replace the whole mirror and I had to wait a few days for the parts.  I don't know how it happened but you know electronics.
2) The passenger side light on the bottom of the door didn't....work for lack of a better word.  More exactly, the housing for the light bulb fell into the door cavity so while it was lit, it didn't show.  They had to 'open' the door cavity and refit the housing.

Concerns
I now have a concern over the climate control.  It doesn't seem to allow my A/C to get as cold as it can...even turned all the way down, on a hot day, no matter how long I've been driving, my A/C doesn't seem to get cold.  When it's cooler outside, or at night, then the A/C has no problems.  I'll have to take it in.

Overall impression
2 years later and I'm still happy with this car.  I still have half the warranty left and she still drives like a dream.  If you're in the market for a used car, check one of these out...just make sure you look at the details I've mentioned above.  :)
