            I have a 1999 Breeze, bought new.  Mine has the standard engine with the 5-speed; the ability to buy a stick shift was a major factor in buying the car.  I owned a Dodge Aries in the 80's with a stick, and it was the largest family car with one.  

I have never had to return this car to my dealer for any problem whatsoever.  I've owned many new cars, but this is a first.  I've put about 30,000 miles on it and have no complaints of substance. The car is rock-solid, very quiet and extremely comfortable to drive.  It feels like a much heavier car than specs indicate.  No, mine isn't the fastest car on the road, but I'm more interested in great mileage and comfort.  It will certainly cruise all day long at 70-80 mph.  I've averaged 31-35 mpg since new.  I'm single but I often carry other adults and it has plenty of room for 4 adults in comfort.  The trunk is huge.  

Drawbacks?  The cup holders are too small--I use my roomy console compartment.  The headlights are not the best, particularly on low beams; this is a styling compromise.  

I read the review where the person had such bad luck with repairs on the Breeze.  Unfortunately, there are still wide variations in dealerships.  My local dealer has provided me with complete satisfaction for two prior cars and I have no doubt they will serve me well when I require them for the Breeze.  

I feel I've gotten Camry/Accord quality and capability without their commensurate high prices.  I also am saddened to see the Plymouth name disappear after all these decades.  Probably has something to do with the Germans taking over!<br><br>
