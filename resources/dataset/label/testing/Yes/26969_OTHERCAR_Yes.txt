            Fun to drive; interior could be &quot;warmer&quot;

I just bought a Galant LS. This car is very fun to drive: the V6 engine doesn't lack power or torque, and the handling is superb. It is quiet, and offers plenty of space. It is ideal for my commute, while allowing some fun on back country roads or empty highways.

I was also considering buying a VW Jetta VR6 or a Nissan Maxima, but the Galant was eventually the right combination : bigger than the Jetta, but less bulky than the Maxima and less expensive than both, especially with Mitsubishi's 0.9% APR. And it looks much better than the dull Camry or Accord.

Among the few regrets, the very succinct list of options. Not that you lack much, but a manual/auto gearbox would be nicer for enjoying the ride, the supposedly premium stereo sounds like a cheap radio, the passenger window is one-touch down, but not up, there is no exterior temperature indicator and the range of available colors seems aimed at making you choose black or white.

Qualitywise, the interior is a bit on the cheap side, especially the center console: you have to open it to provide cup holders for the rear passengers, it only closes properly if you keep the CDs centered, and overall, it looks like an after-market add-on. Also, the faux- wood, and the exterior chrome grille do not exactly make the car more attractive.

But overall, this car offers a very good combination of  functionality and fun: it makes my daily commute a lot more fun than with my SUV!
