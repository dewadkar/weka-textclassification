            Last weekend, my best friend had a shocker for me.  Her husband had gotten a wild hair and decided to buy her a new car even though she did not WANT one (<a href='/./auto-review-1B6B-D7EC0A7-398768D9-prod4'>http://www.epinions.com/./auto-review-1B6B-D7EC0A7-398768D9-prod4</a> and <a href='/auto-review-6E02-21314D4F-39EDB2CE-prod4'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-6E02-21314D4F-39EDB2CE-prod4</a>). The vehicle which he purchased for her was the <b>2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24 Coupe</b>.

Having driven a 2001 and a 2000 Cavalier now I can say to you that there is a great difference between the two vehicles.  Even though the actual interior of the vehicles sizewise is essentially alike, I believe that the Z24 model is actually more comfortable overall.  There's a difference in the seats and the way that the seatbelts fit both the driver and the passenger.  I found that in the regular Coupe model that the the seatbelts were really rather constraining.

However, the biggest difference between the two vehicles is the engine. The <i>2001 Chevrolet Coupe</i> has an 8 Valve, 2.2L I4 engine with 115@5000 horsepower and the <b>2000 Chevrolet Z24</b> has a 16 Valve, 2.2L I4 engine with 150@5600 horsepower.  This makes a major difference in the performance of this vehicle and I can tell that rather readily.  The Z24 definitely has more get up and go and the engine sounds rather smooth.  The regular 2001 coupe is not as quiet and sounds rough at times.

Features in my best friend's car include the following : Air conditioning, Driver side airbag, Passenger side airbag, Alloy wheels, Anti-lock brakes, Anti-theft vehicle, Cruise control, Rear defogger, Keyless entry unlock, Fog lamps, Power locks, Power mirrors, Power steering, Power windows, AM/FM radio, CD player, Anti-theft radio, Second row folding seats, Rear Air Dam, Tachometer, Tilt steering Cassette, Traction control, and Automatic transmission.  

The trunk of the <b>2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24</b> is just as roomy as the 2001 Cavalier.  We had gone shopping for both clothes and groceries and found that it could hold a tremendous amount of cargo.  Howver, I do feel that the backseat foot room is rather cramped as I stated for the 2001 Cavalier Coupe.

There are a few things that my friend doesn't like about this car.  First is that it takes a lot more gas than her older Geo Metro did.  She's used to filling up her car 1/2 a tank for $5, and the tank on the Cavalier holds more and gets less miles per gallon. The second thing that she's trying to get used to is to having a keyless entry system. Having used keys all of her life she's not used to pressing a button and getting the car unlocked.  

Overall, this vehicle works for her.  She doesn't have backseat passengers usually and only carries her mother or grandmother with her when she runs errands to the grocery store.  So since very few adults travel with her in the back seat of her car, she is rather happy with this purchase.  

Given a choice between the <b>2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24</b> and the <i>2001 Chevrolet Cavalier Coupe</i> I would choose the Z24 model first.  I believe that the engine and handling functions of that version of the Cavalier are far better than the regular coupe model and would serve to last longer in the end.<br><br>
