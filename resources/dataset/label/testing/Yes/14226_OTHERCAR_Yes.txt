            I highly recommend this camera. It's not perfect and there will be more advanced cameras,
but you may never NEED to buy another if you are a novice or Intermediate user. None of the
low points are serious like other cameras. It has so many features, many people won't use
them all! If you buy inexpensive NIMH Batteries the power usage is excellent (@40 pictures
per day and lots of screen reviewing and I only put fresh Batteries in each morning). I bought
the 340 Meg Microdrive and use USB download. The program loads fast and files pictures very
sensibly. It makes you forget about the large size of these pictures. I took as many pictures as
I could on a recent trip (300) and had space yet for another 100 pictures! I used the night
feature on about half... Pictures I would not have usually taken. Same features on a lighter
camera could tempt me to switch in the future, but the price would have to be real cheap. I
don't expect that to happen for some time. Here is one of the undocumented
features..Pictures taken @ 90ï¿½ somehow are viewed properly without having to edit in the
Photoloader program provided. (I wonder if there is a mercury sensor in the Camera!)
Someone has been working long hours on the useability of this gaget and forgot that it's just a
