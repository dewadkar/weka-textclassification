            This was my very first car to own since the summer of 1998, of my senior year. We reside in Stockton, CA (I call it STUCKTOWN) and we got it from the Roger Ernst Auction in Modesto, CA (Check out www.rogerernst.com for details) for $3,400 and bought a one year only warranty! (I forgot for how much the warranty is, but a cool idea to do is after getting the car, try to break it; driving it wrecklessly, burning up the engine, screw up the axles joints and the like, and anything else that is covered by the warranty as long as you dont go over one year. The car will have alot of new parts and you probably only had to pay 50 bucks deductable or something like that, and the car lifespan should be quadrupled. It's just a thought for it, but I'm not sure if the Roger Ernst auctions still do one year warranties. Just gonna have to call them up and ask yourself)

Anyway, at 101 thousand mileage, this ride was pretty great and fits my image. It sounds strong and loud. Its pretty fast with 124 horses. It has been driven to Galt, Lodi, Modesto, Tracy, and the Bay Area. It has 131 thousand miles and still goes strong. I enjoyed my senior year with this car as I have taken my friends in it to places to and from and to parties and the like. The AC when blown feels like the antarctic. It's COLD.
I enjoy having this car. However I traded it with my mom to have her sentra, and then I totalled her sentra, and then I bought a 1994 Mazda 626 which is plagued with problems (I also written a review on that)

Anyway, back to talking about the saturn. Lets talk about some negatives, which are a FEW! Some upholstery like on the outside peels off like the rubber siding, but thats just because its old but looks new. There's paint film peeling and paint frayed, but no biggie. I have been asked, "is yours a '96?" and I say nah its a 91 but then they say, "looks new". The transmission kinda went bad, but that was after lending it to my fast and furious racing friend who owned an Integra but that day his car was in the shop because of faulty tires. He shifted from reverse to drive without fully braking. When I got the car back, as I shifted to reverse, the car just shuddered rough. That was $2,400 to fix. So learn from this :-) And after a while, and electrical problem occured. The battery was replaced twice, then again for the third time. It was the alternator that was worn.

But now, the only problems is a humming noise and the horn stuck, but that was my fault again because on a bad day I pounded the horn loud. I had to take out the fuse. Also power door locks went off and on, but its gone. Maybe a glitch?

But you know what... Saturns live long and run well for a domestic car. Saturn first came out in 1991. Not below the '90's or 80's. Pretty cool. It actually is part of GM. Too good to be true because they're really RELIABLE.

I regret not keeping the Saturn and trading it with my mom's car, so that we wouldn't be tight on some budget.

In the near future I'll plan to get the new Saturn VUE SUV or the new V-6 LS 300.
