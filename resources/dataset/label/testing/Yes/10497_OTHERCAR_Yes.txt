            It is a brand new car company struggling in the market with just three models.  This is a nice car, however it has no reputation and a very weak engine.  I have find myself flooring it at red lights, yet for some reason, the guys driving GEO Metros are pulling away.  The car has been pretty reliable, but it is not comfortable and the ergonomics are pretty harsh.  This car loaded would be worth driving, but if you are the average Daewoo consumer, you go very low-key to save a buck.  Low-key is worth nothing in this car, and the value deprecciates to fast.  The 1999 models that cost 14000 now are down to an asking price of about $8000.  Thats bad.<br><br>
