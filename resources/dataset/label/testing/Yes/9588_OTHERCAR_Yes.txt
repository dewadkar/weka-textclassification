               The all new Toyota Celica is like a hot tamales nowadays. More people decided to buy the car because of it's cutting edge design. I have been driving the car for almost a year now.  If you are here to learn more about the car, I hope my insights will be useful to you. Basically, I will explain my likes and dislikes about this car.
   As you may know, the new Toyota Celica has a very sharp design. Toyota did a good job designing the interior part too. When you are in the car, you will feel like being in a cockpit. Everything seems to be in the right place. The gadgets are so cool and sporty. For example, the steering wheel is wrapped with leather and has buttons just like in Boxster for shifting gears. It also has metal pedals and funky like gear shifter. Seat are nice and comfy and the gauges are easy to read. Stereo system is awesome considering it is a manufacturer item. Jamming in this car is a must for music lovers!
  Toyota Celica always has a very good record in terms of performance and reliability.  It has VVTL-I engine same as Lexus. Eventhough it only has 4 cylinder, you will be amazed
that this little car could produce up to 180 horsepower. As to date, I never have any problem with this car. It runs great everyday. That is why this car has a very good resale value compared to Ford, Chevy, Hundai etc. For instance, my husband bought a 2000 Mitsu Galant just couple months before I got my Celica. His car already depreciate over $6000 while mine only $3000.
  It is really hard to find something that you will like hundred percent. It applies to my 2000 Toyota Celica as well. I chose to get the auto GTS because it is easy to use during heavy traffics. The problem is sometime when I press the gas it would not produce  the power that I want. I am glad  that I do not race very much with other drivers. Secondly, the dashboard can get scratched up easily.  It always got scratched when I dust my dashboard. I got frustrated sometimes because I am very fussy about the condition of my car. Lastly, it is about the cd player. I love the stereo system but the cd player skipped a lot on a humid day. Some say that the cd player is very sensitive. It got better though after awhile.
  In conclusion, there are so much stuff that you will like about the all new Toyota Celica. I always proud driving this car around.  Deep down in my heart I always say "I'm better than you ". If you are looking for a fun and reliable car this will be the one for you. My sincere advice, enjoy your life while you can.
