            I purchased a Mirage S, 1.5 liter, five speed in Late July after my previous ride decided to give up its ghost at a VERY inopportune moment for me. 

Two doors, metallic green, 71K miles and still in great mechanical shape.  Good tight fit and finish, no rattles, little wind noise and good visibility from behind the wheel. 

No air-conditioning but a neat little sunroof and a color and racing package that drew raves from my 13 year old daughter, 'Hey Dad, you finally bought a cool car!'

I've never owned a cool car that's averaging 36 miles to the gallon but I LOVE IT.  Aside from oil changes at 3K, I've never needed to add oil.  Will be changing the timing belt this weekend (the original is still in the car), and the only niggling annoyance is that neither Chiltons nor Haynes makes a book for this care...I had to buy the manufacturer's books (thorough beyond all need and pricey at $125).  

Good styling, complete with a rear spoiler for when I'm doing 110 mph (in my imagination, if nowhere else) and a low cost of acquisition.  
Good value and good fun  <br><br>
