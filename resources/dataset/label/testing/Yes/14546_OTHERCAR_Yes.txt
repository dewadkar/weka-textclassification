            Wait!

A digital video camera for a $100 buck?!?!

Yep!

The video is a little grainy. There is no flash.  The TFT viewer is a bit dim. But, hey! It only costs a 100 bucks!

This little marvel is a digital still camera.  A digital video camera.  A web cam.  And a voice recorder.  All in one.

And it runs on two AA batteries.

And it records up to 45 minutes of video on a 256MB Compact Flash card.

And it has a TFT viewfinder so you can see what you are filming and to see your photos and to watch replays of your videos.

And it can show photos and videos on your TV!

And it only costs a 100 bucks!!!!!!

As a digital still camera, it takes photos at 1024X768 pixels.  The color balance is quite good, especially with well lit scenes.  It also works well indoors in a well lit room.  Given that it has no flash, low-light environments are beyond its capabilities.  But, hey!  It only costs a 100 bucks!

As a webcam, it generates about 30 frames per second at 320X240 speeds and works quite well.  Again, it is best to use it in a well lit room.  And it has a built in microphone.  And, hey!  It only costs a 100 bucks!

As a voice recorder, the fidelity is acceptable on both record and playback, but you would not want to play music on it due to its tiny built in speaker.  But, hey!  It only costs a 100 bucks!

As a digital video camera......this is sweet....45 minutes of AVI video on a 256MB Compact Flash card.  The AVI format is a standard windows format video file.  You can play them on any Windows based computer.  Just pop the CF card out of the camera and put it in a CF card reader attached to your computer and watch it like any other Windows video file. The video is at 320X240.  It has a frame rate of about 15 fps which makes the video a little jerky if there is a lot of motion but, hey!  It only costs a 100 bucks!

The best thing about this little gem is its size.  It is about 3.3 inches by 2.7 inches by 1.6 inches.  It weights just a few ounces and easily slips into your pocket.  I use mine in situation where I would never take a video camera.  I lend it to my kids! I take it skiing. On roller coasters.  Out a car window while driving 80 mph.  Rock climbing.  Cause if you drop it...?  Hey, it only costs a 100 bucks!  

So, if you want a handy little cam that can be both a still camera and a video camera, (even if you own real versions of both), you MUST buy the Aiptek DV2!

I got mine at Best Buy!  They are also available directly from www.aiptek.com!

PS. People stop me all the time and say "What a cool little digital camera!".  When I tell them that it is actually a digital video camera as well as a still camera, their jaws drop!  "NO WAY!  Where can I get one?"
