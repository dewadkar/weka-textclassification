            Well, after 11 generations and being completely redisigned, this car turns out to be really something great.  I have never really been impressed by the other Celicas until I test drove this one.  This car has smooth handling, 6 speeds, great breaking, and everything you could want from a fun, sportscar.  It even looks great form the outside.  What really grabbed my attention was the headlights, which I think are really cool on this car.  
On the inside, this car is also pretty nice.  The standard stereo is above average, and the seats are also pretty comfortable.  However, this car will get cramped inside very quickly, and 2 people is definately enough to fill this baby up.  The trunk is fairly small, but, then again all trunks are in sportscars of this genra. 

* Bottom line - Definately check out the Totoya Celica.  Trust me, the worst part of this car is its name! <br><br>
