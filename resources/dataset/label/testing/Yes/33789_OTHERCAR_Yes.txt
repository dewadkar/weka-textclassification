            Late 1995 I needed a new car.  The only one I could afford at the time was a leftover 1995 Geo Metro Hatchback.  At the time I was pretty disappointed.  All my friends made fun of me, &quot;Where's the big key to wind it up&quot; and &quot;How many &quot;D&quot; cell batteries does that thing take?&quot;  So I was pretty upset.  

Now, five years later, I'm the one making fun of them.  They've all had problem after problem.  Many have just given up and traded in for different cars.  I have never had even a minor problem with my car (**knock wood**).   The only time my car sees the inside of a shop is for inspections and oil changes.

I'm not really very good about taking care of my car, either.  I go about 6,000 miles between oil changes. I use the cheapest gas I can find. I make jackrabbit starts.  And, I have a lead foot.  So, as you can see, I push this little car to the max while not really giving it too much in return.  And, still I've had no problems.  You can't get more reliable than that.

There is one little problem.  There is not a lot of leg room in the back.  There is plenty if you are putting children in the back, or you are just going a short way.  But, an average size adult is going to get uncomfortable very quickly in the back seat of this car and a tall adult is just not going to fit - period.  So it would not make a good &quot;main&quot; car for a family.

In spite of the back seat limitations, I would recommend this car to all singles, couples, and commuters.  It is a VERY good, reliable car.<br><br>
