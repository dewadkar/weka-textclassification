            This is one of those vehicles that you don't want to own, but you find yourself using all the time. I have never stuck so much money into a car in such a short time as I have with this thing. I bought our 1995 K1500 with 4 wheel drive in Nov. 2001 with 96000 miles on it and I have had to replace the transmission (122k) the Alternator (102k) Water pump (106k) shocks (112k) fixed a bad coolant leak (120k)and now at 130k miles, I am looking at replacing the entire exhaust system, which I never had to do with other cars I have owned. I realize the mileage is the major cause for all the repairs, don't get me wrong, but I live in Atlanta and all those miles are from driving on the freeway, not in stop and go traffic. I have a 1989 Mercedes 190e with 160k on it and did not have half the problems I have with this car. My 1991 Accord is as good as it was when it was new, and that one just turned 120k. Fuel mileage is a none issue. <br>Obviously a 5400 pound vehicle is not going to do well on a gallon of gas. <br><br>The interior is not very well built. Seats are covered with cheap leather and vinyl and it is wearing poorly. Too much plastic that comes apart too easily. Air conditioning is weak, at best. Unless you are on the freeway, it barely keeps the heat away. Heater works fine in the colder months. Exterior is not much better. Thin body panels allow for lots of door dings and such. Paint is not aging well at all. <br><br>Now for the good side. <br><br>With room for 8 people, it is the most comfortable ride I ever had. Very spacious interior and loads of leg room for everyone. Great towing capacity and a good cargo capacity as well. especially with all the seats down, It's like a pick up. There is a feel of safety when driving this thing down the road because of it's size and road visibility is very good.  <br>
