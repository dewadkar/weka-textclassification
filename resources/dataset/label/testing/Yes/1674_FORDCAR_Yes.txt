            Ford has out done itself with this super sport utility vehicle. It is a vehicle that has a personality all its own. If you want room and are not afraid to drive a vehicle the size of a small state, then the Excursion is for you. It stands seven feet tall and is nineteen feet long, but it drives like a car. Driving the Excursion gives the impression that you are at the controls of a true luxury vehicle. If getting high fuel mileage is important to you, then this is not the vehicle for you. It averages eight point eight in the city and twelve to fourteen miles to the gallon on the highway. The base price is $40,880: this includes front air bags, front captain chairs, four speed automatic transmission, air conditioning with front and rear controls, anti-lock brakes, sixteen inch wheels, floor and overhead consoles,premium sound system with CD player,and four wheel drive. The Triton V-10 power-plant gives you more than ample get up and go, as well as, the top end power to keep you going. To own the Excursion gives the rights to brag about being King or Queen of the road.<br><br>
