            The '94 Ford Escort LX Station Wagon is my first car. My parents bought it last year for about $3000 with 100,000 miles. While this car isn't gonna win any awards for performance or looks, it certainly won me over.

<b>Performance</b>

The steering certainly isn't the greatest. There's a lot of raw torque involved in steering which lead to a loss in precision. Maybe I'm just used to power steering. The brakes are great in normal conditions. You can easily tailgate without fear of smashing into that car in front of you. However, everything is different in icy/rainy conditions. Since this car does not have antilock brakes, you are forced to pump the brakes manually which leads to an increase in your minimum stopping distance. If you do not pump the brakes, it's almost inevitable that the wheels will lock and you will skid. After crashing the car in a rain storm last summer, I learned that this car was not made for aggressive driving slick conditions. Acceleration is not a problem in this car. While you won't be winning any races on the road, you certainly do get a fair amount of pickup. I'm also impressed by the sound and feel of power you get when you floor the accelerator. This car can easily do 90 mph on the highway without worries. I can get about 23 miles per gallon overall. 

The car also has a nice feel. It's lowness to the ground makes it agile on the road. This also poses a few problems. You feel bumps a lot more in this car. You constantly have the headlights of trucks and SUV's in your mirrors and rear window. You have to watch out for curbs and railroad tracks too. I've knocked the muffler out twice already. It's also narrow. You can always fit into that &quot;almost too small&quot; parking space at the mall.

The radio is decent. There's not a lot of bass and there's a lot of distortion at high volume. This is certainly not a car to &quot;bump&quot; in, but the radio does a decent job. The air conditioner is by far the best feature. Also it does decrease acceleration slightly, it cools down quickly and provides you with all the winter air you'll ever need during those hot summer days. When I was taking my driving test, the examiner said, &quot;This little car has one hell of an air conditioner.&quot; I couldn't agree with him more. The heater takes a long time to get up to a decent temperature (and every moment counts in subzero weather), but it works fine once it gets there. The windows work well. I have a problem with the driver's side window because the stripping keeps coming off. This makes the window jump and creak. It can easily be fixed by putting the stripping back on.

The seats are comfy. There are adjustable headrests in the front that can be removed if need be. The back seat is also comfy although a little cramped for bigger people. The good thing about the wagon is you can fit 8 people in the car. I often find myself with someone in the passenger seat, three people in the back seat, and three people in the trunk. This does significantly reduce acceleration due to the extensive load, so you have to watch out on main streets. The trunk is also great for a person like me who carts around massive amounts of stuff at times. I was the director of an indie movie last summer and we used my car to cart all the equipment around.

<b>Problems</b>

-The wheel alignment seems to go out pretty easily. Maybe I abuse the car a bit much, but it still seems to have poor alignment in general.
-The emergency cut off release button is hard to find. It took a cop fifteen minutes of searching to find it after I crashed the car. I still don't know where it is. :)
-The windows don't insulate well. There is some leakage, not much, and they do not shield you from outside odors. The &quot;recirc&quot; is useless if the windows don't seal.
-My insurance company considers this a sports car (yes, a sports car). Say hello to higher premiums.
-There's a lot of '94 Escort LX Station Wagons out there. 3 other people at my school have the exact same car in the exact same color.

<b>In conclusion . . .</b>

This is a great car in reliability, storage/roominess, and economy. Although it lacks some common safety features found in newer cars (passenger side air bags, ABS), it is safe if driven safely. If you're on a budget and need to get your teen a car, this is certainly a great starter. Your teen will thank you and so will your wallet.<br><br>
