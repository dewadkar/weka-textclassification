            The ePhoto 780 by AGFA, is a great camera for those just entering 
the world of digital mania.  The relatively cheap camera (300 bux about
a year ago, i'm sure it's down by now), has some really nifty features.
It comes with a 2 meg card, (the card that holds the pics). 
This means that, on the lowest resolution selected,(which really isn't
that good), you can hold 96 pics. On the 2nd best, which is relatively
decent, you can hold 36. There are a few more selections. The better the
resolution, the less pics you can take. One feature the 780 lacks, and 
needs is a zoom. You're not gonna be to happy with this, but for most
people, it's something you can live with. Be careful with it! I once
dropped it at Yankee Stadium, about a foot. Ever since then, I get
problems with my card formatting itself, in turn, deleting all my pics
that are already on there. However, most of the time, it's ok. 
I reccomend this for aspiring photogs on a budged.<br><br>
