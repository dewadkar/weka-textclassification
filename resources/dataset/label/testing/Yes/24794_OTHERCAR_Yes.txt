            All the writeups in Car & Driver and R & T over the years put the 740 in a mental class all its own, in my mind. Last spring I was thrilled to be able to drive a beautiful Biaritz Blue iL model out of Gault Auto Sport. The presentation was fitting for a car that goes for almost 70k. It was under cover when we walked into the room where it was sitting, with balloons attached, and a gala production was in progress. When the car was displayed, it was beautiful. Perfectly prepared. Just waxed to the nth degree to show off that great BMW finish to its best advantage. All in all a most satisfying experience.
The drive home was up to expectations. Once the seats and wheel were properly adjusted, along with the mirrors etc.,the ride home was up to expectations. They say that if you try to work the navigation system while driving, you will have an accident. I believe it.  Set it up before you start and you will be fine. 
Ride is as good as it gets. Seats are super comfortable and the iL has the neatest seat adjustment for the upper back that I have ever seen. The active comfort seats give great massage and are truly relaxing on a trip of any consequence. Transmission is smooth and tractable. My only complaint is that it seems a bit noisy when shifting in town , on occasion. Room galore in front and back. So much room in back that they even equip the seats with footrests. 
As every thing I read says, the controls are a bit spacy. When you finally learn how to manage the multifunction wheel and all the buttons, you feel like a graduate from MIT. It is tricky enough that, when my wife wanted to play AM radio, I couldn't manage to remember how to turn it on. Now, the CD player and the rest of the sound system are fine. I do wish that the cartridges for the CD player and the navigation system were up front instead of in the trunk.
This car comes with everything you can desire. I also wish that the included telephone, which is a fine digital Motorola was an option. When I tried to get hooked up with Verizon's all included plan, my phone would not work. Had to be something special. Since the included phone has so many nice gizmos, like on screen dialing  etc., I had to forego the plan that I really wanted.
The included navigation system is too complicated for easy use. You have to grow into it, and, after 8 months, I am starting to feel comfortable . I also wish that the CDs that hold the information were more affordable and had more detailed information. Seems that if you need 5 or 6 CDs to cover the USA, they ought to cover more than the Interstates and the larger cities. Guess that we have to wait for DVD to capture that for the motoring public.
I have only had two problems with the car. the gas cap became disconnected from the plastic retaining gadget but the service manager fixed that while I waited one day. No big deal. The cup holder in the back seat is a mystery. The tray has proved impossible to push back into its slot. Again, not a biggie, but still a pain in the neck for a Luxo sedan. Speaking of cup holders, they are not world class. I find them a problem to use without spilling my drink  unless the cup is of exactly the right size.
A pleasant surprise was the gas economy. On our trip south, we averaged 26.4 mpg from house to house. Average speed was around 60 mph, so that is about as good as it gets for a full size car like the 740. The numbers quoted show how you can enjoy the onboard computer and while away some of the time on a long trip.
All in all it is a great car. Sooooo comfortable and so responsive. All the power in the world . Great xenon lights. Beautiful fit and finish. All the parts fit and appear to be of the highest quality.
Would I buy another? Probably. This model will be replaced in the '02 model , I have been told, so I will be anxious to see what those Bavarians come up with to outclass the MB S class.
