            In my work, I needed a camera to replace the 35mm &quot;point and shoot&quot; the staff was using.
I didn't want to spend a fortune either.

The D360L met the challenge.

I'm not a big reader of manuals. So, true to form, I took the camera out of the box, put in the batteries, turned it on and handed it to my wife to snap a pic. (she is not a &quot;techie&quot;)
The photo was great.  (Except for the ceiling fan that looked like it was my hat)

Not much later, she and I were planting flowers, and the sun was setting. I put her just to one side of the setting sun (me facing the sun!) and snapped.  The picture was great again!  Her face was visible and the suns rays made it look &quot;arty.&quot;

Close-ups?  How about a flower from eight inches.  I got a great shot. I had just watered the flower, and the water droplets showed on the petals.  The depth of field was outstanding.

Mind you: this is within the first dozen pictures and all taken on automatic setting.

By the time I had downloaded the photos it was dark outside.  I stepped outside to snap a pic of the same flower.  It was so dark, I couldn't see through the view-finder, but the picture was acceptable.  The flower was washed out by the flash of course, but color was excellent.

Downloading the photos to PC was uneventful.  I have a Mac also, so I'm anxious to get the free connector to see if the camera works well with the Mac too.

This camera is for the person who wants to spend less than $300 (I paid $253 plus $9 handling) and have a point and shoot camera that will deliver excellent quality.

It would appear that there are enough manual settings to satisfy all but the most fanatic photographer.
