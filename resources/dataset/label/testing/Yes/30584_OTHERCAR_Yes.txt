            This car is a must have for all moms!  We had to buy a bigger car after adding twins to our family last year.  I was very apprehensive about getting a minivan because I did not want to feel like I was driving a minivan.  The Honda Odyssey drives like a car.  All my friends that borrow the van come back saying what a pleasure it was to drive our car, and how well it handles.

We love the room, and the 4 doors are great to get kids into and out of the car.  Another plus is the easy to fold seats.  We recently moved and we were able to move most of our things just in the minivan.  

An all around great vehicle for moms or anyone that needs lots of room!!<br><br>
