            Our 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP is better than several luxury cars on the streets.  The striking exterior design attracts attention.  Sun roof or moon roof adds distinction.  The polished aluminum wheel covers keep everybody looking as my son drives by.

Several luxury cars have bland exterior looks.  The GTP is special.  My son chose dark forest green for this purchase, but his next GTP, in the spring of 2000, may be red.  We'll see.

The heads-up display on the windshield gives mph quickly, without the driver having to look down at the dash instruments.  Of course, at night, what driver wouldn't like to look at the bright red instrument panel that really does resemble a cockpit?

Great dependable car.  And Pontiac's extended warranty is always honored by the dealer.<br><br>
