            We bought the 1999 Chevy Astro van in August 2000. It had 19,000 miles on it. We bought this van to replace our 1990 Chevy Astro van.We had such good luck with the 1990 one we decided to buy another Astro. It seats 8 people comfortably and can tow our boat just fine. We really like the rear A/C, the comfortable seats and the nice looking dashboard.
We have 3 children and boy can we get the kids and a ton of stuff in this van. We have the all wheel drive option. Which is a must in the midwest.
We looked at MANY MANY MANY minivans when we were shopping for this. This one won out because it has the largest towing capacity of any minivan, it has the largest motor of any of them and the size, it has so much room.
if you are looking for a minivan I highly advise taking a look at a new Astro van :)<br><br>
