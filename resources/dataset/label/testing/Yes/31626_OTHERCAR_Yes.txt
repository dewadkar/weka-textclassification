            This is what I had (I just gave it to my dad):
Nikon Coolpix 800 digital camera, 8MB flash card, carrying case, software, serial cable, and AC adapter for the camera. This camera can be used with 4 standard AAA batteries or external 6V source.

This camera is probably the best ever digital camera world entry level buy. The picture is so sharp, it looks better than my sis' Olympus 3.4 Megapixel. Coolpix 800 features 2.1 Megapixel. It's also probably due to the lens quality Nikon manufactures. It's lightweight and compact, not bulky as the other, even the other Nikon products. The only smaller one I've seen was Nikon Coolpix 775, which produces crap, in my opinion. Reasonable price (the new one is $400), I bought the refurbished one from ebay about $250. The 3 settings picture size will help also to save space if you dont have massive flash card. My 8 MB will jam in 8 pictures hi quality, 16 normal quality or 32 low quality. The low quality is the one I usually use to get not so detailed picture like for ebay auction or just point and click scenery. Digital zoom 2.5x, optical zoom 2x. Not an SLR, but you can view the exact picture it will produce on the 1.8" LCD real time! Really big plus!

The feature I hate the most however, is the absence of USB port for picture download. It's absolutely slow to download using serial cable. So when you buy this camera, unless you have flash card reader, dont bother buying more flash capacity higher than 16 MB. You'll die waiting for the pics to get downloaded. I'm not sure about newer model. I bought this one in 2000.

Good luck!
