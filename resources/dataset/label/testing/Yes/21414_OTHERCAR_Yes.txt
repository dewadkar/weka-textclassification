            As I stepped away from the rental counter, my heart sank as I walked to the lot. "A Hyundai", I thought. "Great. Just great". I hadn't been in a Hyundai for 15 years, and that was a ratty, decrepit Excel. For some reason I keep thinking of the "Dragnet" movie, where Friday and Strebek are issued a "Yugo" for their patrol vehicle. 

So, imagine my surprise when I walk up to a neatly styled Elantra. "Nice looks," I said to myself. "But I bet it's a piece of junk". 

I throw my stuff in the trunk (small, but adequate). As I close the trunk, it makes a tinny sound, but no rattles.
I go to the door. I open and shut it a few times. Sounds like a bank vault. Solid, secure, everything I want between me and a side-on collision. I sit down. The dash is clearly marked, the gauges are easy to read. I'm in business.

I start the engine. Again, solid. No extraneous noises, no rattles, no chirps. (At this point, I'm asking myself if this really IS a Hyundai).

So I head up the highway. I note that the stalks off the steering wheel are, well, different from about every other car I've ever driven. The cruise control is unique in it's positioning. But the steering is solid, and once I acquaint myself with the cruise functions and wiper blade controls I feel comfortable with them.

Just a couple of miles from the airport I have to merge with interstate traffic--I don't know the Elantra will do, so I'm a little hesitant--until I hit the gas. The Elantra has plenty of power. It merges, no problem, then keeps up and PASSES, no problem.

"Hey", I think. "I'm beginning to like this". Six hundred miles later, I hated to turn the car back in. It drove like a dream, it was comfortable (the seats are a little stiff  but no more so than any other car in this class). The convenience features (cupholders, storage, etc) are well-designed and put in the right places.

So, in three days this car made me a believer. Hyundai has turned the corner, from inexpensive "junk" cars, to inexpensive "quality" cars. I'm going shopping this weekend!!
