            I have owned my Chevrolet Astro Van for almost 4 years now, I bought it used. I just love it. It is a roomy van, great to haul the kids and groceries.I have not had to have it serviced much at all. It now has almost 150,000 miles on it and still runs great! 
If you are looking for a long lasting mini van, the Chevrolet Astro Van is worth checking out.
One thing I do wish it had was sliding side doors on BOTH sides, but mine is a 1990, so maybe the newer ones have the doors on both sides.
The seats are very comfortable and the rear seat comes out in the case you need to haul something large back there.
It gets good gas mileage for a mini van I think, it gets about 25 miles to the gallon.
This is a great mini van for long trips, very comfortable ride.<br><br>
