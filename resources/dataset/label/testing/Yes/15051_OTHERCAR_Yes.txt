            I just received the Sony MVC-FD73 as a Christmas gift from my husband.  Well, we had only been &quot;toying&quot; with the idea of a digital camera and one thing I had noticed about the entire Sony Product line was that they were the only ones offering floppy disk storage.  What easier way to take and transfer pictures, pass them along to family and friends, etc.

It took me only a short time to learn the basics of using this camera.  And, given the nature of digital cameras, I had plenty of time and opportunity to &quot;practice&quot; before I went to my family's for Christmas dinner.

As far as price...I checked with several different merchants, both online and offline, and found that you can purchase this model for about $400 with the case, battery, charger, etc.

There are several cool features available in this model, including a &quot;multi&quot; function allowing you to take a series of pictures and creating a short video (sort of like the old flip books we had as kids).  The picture quality is very good, however, I would recommend using an alternate photo program to the one provided with the camera.  The program that comes with the camera is complicated and the pictures do not &quot;look&quot; as good when you first open them.  I use Corel Photohouse and it is a breeze to make corrections and add even more effects than the camera provides.  (The camera provides a B&amp;W, negative, sepia and polarize options.)

There are also some adjustments in lighting and brightness (I haven't yet mastered these, but I play around with them for now).  And I haven't memorized the &quot;Program&quot; functions yet, but they auto adjust the settings for a variety of lighting/setting combinations and the activity you are trying to photograph.

Also, this camera allows for an instant review of the photos you have taken and you have the option of protecting the photo from deletion or deleting the photo and retaking it while the subjects are still there.

And, finally...a cool idea, if you are interested...
My daughter just celebrated her 13th birthday and had a house-full of girls over for a slumber party.  Now, I labored over the choices for party favors with my daughter making faces at every suggestion.  Then...on a flash of inspiration...I started taking photos of the girls...some posed, some candid shots...and I made a copy of the disk for each girl to take home with her as a party favor...do you know...my daughter didn't laugh and the girls were tripping over themselves trying to watch me edit their photos and choosing which ones they wanted on &quot;their&quot; disks!<br><br>
