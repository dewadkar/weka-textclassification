            I recently bought this camera after extensive searching.  It comes with 3 Clik disks.  Each one can hold about 60 high resolution pictures.  I can't imagine ever needing more storage than 180 pictures.  I've never taken that many pictures, even on a long trip.  Especially if you factor in that since this is a digital camera, they would be 180 GOOD pictures, because any bad ones would just be deleted right away.  The pictures are wonderful.  Not at all grainy -- and the colors are vivid.

This camera has multiple settings, including a macro which is really good for taking pictures of items for an online auction.  It has both a LCD screen and a viewfinder.  The Screen is a little slow on refreshing, but nothing too bad.  If you have it set on auto-focus, there is a brief delay between clicking the 'shutter' and when the picture is actually taken.  According to the manual, however, you can set the focus so that it will take the picture right away.

The camera comes with a USB, which makes the data transfer super fast.  It also comes with a cord that you can use to hook the camera up to the TV so that you can go through the pictures this way.  If you don't want to use batteries, it comes with a power cord that you can use.  There is also a camera case in the box, as well.  Many of these things you usually have to buy separately.

The software is decent.  You can crop and rotate pictures, but you will probably want to use some other program if you want to do some more intricate editing.  There are lots of free programs that you can download for this.

Like all digital cameras, it goes through batteries fairly quickly.  I just bought a pack of rechargeables and haven't had a problem since.  If the batteries get low, I can just use the camera's AC adapter while the batteries are recharging.
