            In December 99, I did extensive research on purchasing a vehicle. Getting the best buy for the dollar was a major concern for me.  I test drove everything from a VW,cadillac,Impala, suburban, etc.  I began to especially like the sport utility vehicle models, so I restricted my search to this category.  After test driving all of them, I found the Tahoe to be by far the best in overall satisfaction.  

I liked the front seat area where there was no fuss...and plenty of room. Not having the built in panel between the passenger seat &amp; driver seat kept the area from clutter.  I choose not to get the 4WD since I live in South Carolina. I did extensive research on pricing of what I wanted thru use of internet, newspapers, etc., and narrowed my price down before approaching the dealer.  Being end of year was an advantage for me, as I walked away with a Tahoe with many extras for about $8K under dealer invoice.  

Now having owned the car, I'm finding it is a superior vehicle. Gas mileage has been on target or above what the invoice sticker stated.  It's easy to drive and rides extremely well on rocky roads as well as highway.  I have the &quot;barn doors&quot; on the back, and if I bought another I would opt for the &quot;tail gate&quot; type doors.  I believe those are more useful in the long run.  

My complaints are:  I wish the windows in the back seat would roll all the way down.  A lot of the cars now only have back windows that roll part of the way down, but since my children are grown, I'd prefer to have the windows roll all the way down if I want.  The back seat area is very adequate in space, recently took a 4 hour trip with 2 passengers in the back seat, one being a 6 foot tall man.  Head room was adequate, but leg space for him would have been better with a few more inches.  We sat him behind the passenger seat, which the rider pulled up more to allow him more leg room.  We found there were plenty of cup holders...all placed in the right place.  The pull down tray in the back seat was extremely useful while traveling for those in the back. 

I would also like to have the car do the same as the Z71 truck for passengers in the front, which gives you the option to turn the air bag on or off, for those times when you need an extra seat a child could use. Other than that, it's a perfect vehicle.  

The seats are built up off the floor and allows plenty of space of storage of any items you might want to keep in the car. In addition, I believe the Tahoe will maintain selling value above any standard car and other SUVs.  I definitely recommend this car.<br><br>
