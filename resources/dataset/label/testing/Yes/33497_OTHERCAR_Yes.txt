            After looking at small sport wagons liked the Subaru best. Found numorous owners and could not find one that would not buy another subaru.
Most stated that got over 200K miles before needed any engine repairs and most were under 700 dollars.
The dealers seem to really help with service compared to the Ford dealer   of the old car I had.  A parts dept sold me a front bra to help from getting stone chips and had a few problems putting it on. Got in installed and then moved cross country. I took the car infor warranty service and commented to the rep that I trouble installing the Bra. He looked at it and stated that it was a different year. He gave me the 800 number of Subaru and said to talk to them. I called and sent them a copy of the invioce and was informed that a complete front Bra and hood cover was being shipped to me for free and take it to the local dealer and they will install it for free. Try to get an american car company to do that without massive hassels!!!
I will bye a nother subaru when the time comes
