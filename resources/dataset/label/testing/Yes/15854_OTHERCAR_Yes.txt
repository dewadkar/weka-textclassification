            After owning several mini-vans it was time to start looking again.  I had always wanted a suburban but thought it was out of our price range. When doing some comparative shopping found out it was not that big of a price difference.  We had almost settled for a Chrysler Town and Country when we decided to drive in and check out a suburban we saw from the road.  When comparing options and the sticker price the burban (as my youngest calls it) was only $2,500. more than the Chrysler T &amp; C. One test drive and we were sold.  We are completely satisfied with our burban and from its ride and handling to trailer towing and impressive gas mileage.  Yes, that's right gas mileage.  WE average between 18 and 22 on the highway and a recent 3,000 mile trip overall mileage was 19.5 mpg.  Our old mini-van only got 20.  We have 3 kids, dog, and a cat and find enough room for everyone.  We love to snowmobile and can fit all our gear without giving up passenger room.  I already have my eye on the 2000 Yukon XL (I don't know why they changed the name) but my wife says a few more years.  I won't mind waiting.  We had looked at Expeditions but the suburban won hands down. A friend of ours purchased an Excursion and has not been happy at all. Infact he has a new 2000 Yukon XL that should be hear any day.  Great vehicle and have never been disappointed with service at the GMC dealership.
