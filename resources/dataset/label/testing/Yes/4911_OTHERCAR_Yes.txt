            I have had this camera for about a month now and am so happy that I got it.  I will probably jump around a lot in this review because I am just looking at the camera and writing what comes to me so I apologize for that.

The camera is small enough to take with you in your coat pocket and still take excellent pictures.  It has a solid, well built feel.  The lcd screen is bright and sharp.  The only real problem with the camera is that the auto focus could be a little faster, but in no way is it too slow to deal with.  All the controls for the camera are logically placed and easy to get to without looking.  The daytime pictures that I take come out perfect.  The night time pics on the other hand seem to come out darker than I would prefer.  

All the talk about the flash being too week is crap.  It works fine for me.  The flash actually has three levels that you can choose from (low, normal, and high).  It is pretty powerful for it's size and the only reason I think people say it is weak is probably because they cover it with their finger when taking the picture (I know because it happened to me a few times!).  Once you figure out the best way to hold the camera, all those problems will be solved.

Since the camera is small, the downside is that it is kind of hard for you to hold it steady when taking the pic.  I wish they put that stabli-shot technology from their camcorders into this camera, but what can ya do.

The features that the camera comes with are great.  You have a "clip-motion" feature that is fun to play with along with a 30 sec. movie taking ability.  It also can take pictures in 5 different modes (normal, Negative, sepia, black and white, and solarize).  All of which are fun to play with.

The anti-reflective coating that is put on the LCD screen is phenomenal.  You can see it from any angle and in many different lighting situations (though it does get washed out in direct sunlight but then again, you can't ask for miracles).  The other great thing is the built in lens cap.  I personally think that all cameras should come with that.
