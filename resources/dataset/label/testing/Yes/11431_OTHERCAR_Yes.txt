            The 4Runner is the best SUV on the market!  Toyota offers a good range of option packages, with a variety of different price ranges.  I just bought an SR5 sports package.  It handles nicely with smooth turns.  For as big as the engine is, it's quiet inside the cab.  Seats are extremely comfortable, even offering the driver Lombard back support for those long journeys.  A little more room is needed at the side of seats, by the door side, to allow for easier access to seat adjustment controls.  Factory installed radio-CD with speakers is incredible--allowing you to adjust speakers in the front, mid and rear of the 4Runner.  Dash is not wrap around--which I prefer.  This makes all controls easily accessible to front passenger.  Aside from day to day handling--this is a fun vehicle, especially trekking up and down snow covered mountains!  It's got great traction and an easy system for switching into 4-wheel drive!  I don't know why, but Toyota makes a lot of clutch driven 4Runners.  I test drove one of these--and it was much harder to maneuver than an automatic due to the size of the vehicle!  Having test drove the Jeep, Jeep Cherokee, Pathfinder and the Passport--the 4Runner was the way to go!<br><br>
