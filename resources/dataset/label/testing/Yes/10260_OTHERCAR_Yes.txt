            After days and days of looking for a used car, I finally came across the 1990 Subaru Legacy.  I was not very familiar with Subaru, other than the Outback commercials I had seen, but this car was in remarkable shape considering our Wisconsin winters.  Here are some details about the vehicle:

4 door
Power windows and locks
4 cylinder
Cruise
Tilt steering
ABS
Air
Power steering
Automatic

I bought this car from a friend of mine, who had been its only previous owner.  This car had only needed routine maintenance during the ten years she owned it.  In fact, it still has its original muffler and pipes and still is quiet.

The back seats are very comfortable and offer plenty of space.  Just the other day, I purchased a 2 year old basset hound and strapped him into the back.  If you are familiar with bassets, you know they are very curious.  The little guy had plenty of room to roam around and stick his head out of the window.

Trunk space was deceptively large.  I fit a dog cage, that was in two sections, into the trunk (just barely) and had room for a couple other boxes.

I also like the drivers seat.  I'm the kind of person who will sit more upright, so I need a little more support in the back.  My previous car (Dodge Shadow) was not very good this way, but I felt very comfortable in the Subaru.

Since I like to sit upright, head room is very important.  This car has plenty of it.  In most cars, my hair will be brushing the top, and that is very annoying, but in this car I can sit comfortably.

The pickup was actually shocking.  I have had four cylinder cars before, but this one just took off.  After the initial take off, it is a little slow, but picks right back up again very quickly.

When I get done with school and get a full time job, I would definately consider a Subaru for my next vehicle.
