            I leased a 1999 Pathfinder SE in December of 1998. I was taking a job as a consultant that would require a lot if in-state travel. I was looking for something comfortable and good in bad driving conditions.

I was pleasantly surprised the first time I drove it. It drives like a car and handles wonderfully. I get great gas mileage and must say that this vehicle has quite a lot of power too.

I spoiled myself with all the options and must say I love the seat warmers on those cold winter mornings. I use the 4 wheel drive in heavy rain and no longer hydroplane on the highway in downpours.

The interior is quite roomy and very comfortable. It is an absolute pleasure to drive. I still smile every time I take off out of the driveway,
