            All right, I finally did it. I have been looking for a weekend car or a Jeep for quite awhile. I was very torn between a Miata and a CJ-7. One has the rugged manly thing going on, and the other; the sophisticated style and performance of technology.

OK, I will admit that for the longest time I thought that the Miata was a mid-life crisis mobile for soccer-moms. My step-mom bought one and absolutely loved it. I drove it once and it did handle really well, but it still wasn't perfect for me.  I was never wild about the &quot;hidden&quot; headlights look.  

Then Mazda's designers re-engineered it. The new look is so much better in a not so subtle way. Then, I was wondering if they're change had any effect on the performance. Boy, was I wrong!  Here's what the car has to offer:

<b>Power:</b>  This car has excellent power for a four-banger.  It's light weight really helps it perform.  it's 140 hp @ 6500 rpm and 119 lb/ft of torque at 5500 rpm probe to make this little car boogie.  True, you won't win any drag races with a Mustang Cobra but, you aren't going to pay as much, either.  This car is perfect for the enthusiast that loves to just go out and drive.

<b>Handling:</b>  The car's lowered stance makes cornering a dream.  It tucks in tight like a grand-prix car.  The low-pitch squeal of the low-profile Michelin tires bring a smile to your face and a worried look from the wife.  After you get through the turn she realizes that you really <i>did</i> have everything under control and you were just playing a little bit.  She still tells me to slow down though.  To which she always gets the eye-roll.

<b>Interior:</b>  I really have no problem being comfortable in this car.  It is rated, by Mazda, as having 42&quot; of leg room.  I'm 6/0&quot;; I feel very comfortable and enjoy road trips.  The controls are all within easy reach, which is easy considering how small this car is.  The seats are snug and contoured so that you feel very little slippage in those tight corners.  You just get a lot of confidence from the whole package.

<b>Trunk:</b>  The trunk is nil, but like I said it's a weekend car. &quot;They&quot; claim that it can hold 2 golf bags, but they'd have to be pretty small golf bags. It's perfect for a couple of overnight bags just in case your road trip takes you a little further than normal.

<b>Options:</b>  You could really add an infinite number of options to this car, whether they be Mazda options or after-market.  The SE, Special Edition, has all the options but only comes in purple, actually Mahogany Mica, with a beige leather interior.  In my book, purple and tan don't go all that well together, but I'm a car and computer guy not a fashion coordinator.

The best thing about this car is dropping the top on a warm summer evening, much like now, and star-gazing while your driving down some back highway, exploring. It makes you feel like there's no one else out there.

Another thing about this car is that it has a cult-like following.  Every owner loves it and there are Miata clubs in most, if not all, areas.  Every owner, when asked, will tell you that the car is solid and that they have had absolutely no problems.  Then, their eyes will kind of wander and a small smirk develops on their lips as they start to think about the next weekend.<br><br>
