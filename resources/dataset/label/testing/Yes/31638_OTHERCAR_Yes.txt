             Finally, I can afford the best luxury sports car known to mankind and they stop making it!
 My Rivera is just simply the best car I have ever owned. It is beautiful, sleek, and the color is perfect! I love the heated seat, and all the different settings for heat/air. Regardless of how long or how far I drive it, I still get that tingly feeling when it is time to climb behind the wheel.
 We have had more compliments/comments on this car than any other. From co-workers, bellhops, people in the parking lot at the grocery to our pastor, neighbors and the kid's teachers. EVERYBODY loves the Riv!
  The color is called Taupe, but we prefer to call it Platinum. Matching interior, with the beautiful and fetching gold lettering; chrome wheels. It has the supercharged V-6, so it doesn't take alot of energy to show off a little! Um um, shes a beaut!<br><br>
