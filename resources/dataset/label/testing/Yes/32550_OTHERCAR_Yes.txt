            I wanted to upgrade my old digital 1.3 Kodak DC240 so my husband surprised me for Christmas with the new DX 6490.  I was glad it came with the charging dock and a camera bag.  The shape of the camera is a little different so it&#146s hard to find a good fit.  It&#146s a great camera and the photo quality is wonderful.  However, it was not the point and shoot I was used to.  This is more like a 35 mm camera. It has an automatic setting which is fine for daylight condition&#146s the manual setting takes a little more getting used to. When using 10X zoom I noticed a lot you tend to use a lot more battery power.  When the camera is in the automatic feature you really need the pop up flash but you have to be careful because the shutter speed is to slow and can be blurry pictures.  The other thing I was a little surprised about was that the USB connection to the camera is not the standard connector.  The pop up flash is okay if people are not looking right at you if they are, there is a problem with red eye.  I would recommend a tripod and an external flash.  The camera is definitely not for the beginner it&#146s almost overwhelming with all of the extra features.
