            <b>I</b>n February of this year we bought our 3rd 2-door 4-wheel drive <b>Chevy Blazer</b>.   We still own the 1997 model but sold the 1999 due to it having the rough ride ZR2 suspension.  Our <b>2002 Chevy Blazer</b> has the touring suspension.   It is rare to find a 2-door model of the Chevy Blazer and it is my understanding from the local dealers that Chevrolet will be discontinuing the Blazers ending with this model year in hopes of promoting their more expensive Trailblazer instead.  I do hope GM continues with the regular Blazer series.  General Motors is the only automaker that makes mid-size 2-door SUV's, which are the Blazer and the Jimmy.  We prefer the 2-door models over the 4-door models because 1) they are less expensive, 2) they are sportier looking, and 3) our kids are teens and are drivers themselves therefore, a 4-door model is not needed.

<b>Performance</b>

<b>T</b>he <b>2002 Chevy Blazer</b> drives and rides as smooth as a car, except smoother on off-roads.  The turning radius is excellent in this vehicle, which makes it very easy to park, back-up and make u-turns.   The Blazer climbs up off-road steep terrain with ease as we live on top of a mountain.  Equipping the Blazer with studded tires in the winter and using the 4-wheel drive and you can climb up any icy mountain road.   The steering is tight and it handles curvy roads easily and does not try to tip over. 
 
<b>T</b>he <b>2002 Chevy Blazer</b> uses regular unleaded fuel and averages about 18 mpg in city driving and about 21 mpg on short highway distances.   We have not taken any trips longer than an hour yet to be able to give you a true highway mpg.  Using cruise control as much as possible will help you tremendously in obtaining maximum mpg.  

<b>Interior</b>

<b>T</b>he 2-door models are offered only with cloth seats, which are fine for us since leather seating makes the vehicle more expensive anyway.  The pushbuttons for the 4-wheel drive are located on the dashboard.  The instrument panel gauges consist of an analog type speedometer, trip odometer, fuel, voltmeter, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and tachometer.  There are two 12-volt auxiliary power outlets.  The turn signal has a turn-signal-on reminder chime.  There are two-cup holders in front of the storage console in between the front seats.  In addition to the storage console, there is also the glove compartment.  There are lighted mirrors on each sun visor.  The gearshift for the automatic transmission is floor mounted.  The rear seats on the 2-door model hold 2 passengers in which each seat individually folds down to make for a roomy cargo area.    There is a cup holder in the rear passenger area on both sides of the vehicle with a little dipped in area to hold small miscellaneous items.  On each side of the rear seats is a storage compartment.

<b>Who Probably Would Not Be Happy with the Blazer?</b>

<b>E</b>ach of my family members are 5 foot 9 inches and shorter and everyone with the exception of my husband enjoys driving the Blazer.  My husband likes it and will drive it on short distances, but driving in any distance over an hour, he prefers his Chevy Tahoe, which is a larger SUV.  So, it would be my belief that a taller person that would have to drive a long distance in this vehicle or someone that is use to a larger SUV might not find it as comfortable my teenagers and myself.  

<b>Final Impression</b>

<b>O</b>ur family really loves our Blazer for its sporty looks, its dark tinted private windows, its easy maneuverability and roomy cargo area.  The Blazer has a nifty feature on the rear hatch window whereas you can push the button in to release the hatch.  We own 4 sport utility vehicles (since we have to have 4-wheel drive where we live) and the Blazers are the favorite with our teenagers.
