            A few days ago was my best friends birthday and he got himself a Tahoe.  Let me tell you, we drove it around for a while and I found it to be such a great ride that I am going to get one for myself.  The room in the Tahoe is unbeliable, the ride is so smooth, and to top it all off, it looks great in just about any color.  It is also very reliable off road and is a great famoly car as well.  I would recommend this car to everyone who likes a smooth ride at a reasonable price.  The only bad quality that you might point out about the tahoe is, like every other SUV, it sucks a lot of gas.  Be sure to check out my other car reviews.
