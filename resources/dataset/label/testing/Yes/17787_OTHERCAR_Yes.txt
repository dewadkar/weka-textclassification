            I just got rid of my 94 Dodge Shadow. I had bought the car new and in the 6 years I owned it I only had it in the shop once.  I think this a great car for a family with small children and is compleatly reliable.  This cars handled real well but was a little under powered. It is very good in the snow and on the ice. This car was very well set up and I drove it across country very many times. It was very good on gas. The only real problem I had with it is the paint started to flake off after about 4 years.  It is well set up for getting a car seat in and out.  The car is small inside and I would not recommend it to big people, Me and my wife are both under 5'6&quot;. All in all it was a very good car and I would not have sold it if my family had not gotten bigger.    <br><br>
