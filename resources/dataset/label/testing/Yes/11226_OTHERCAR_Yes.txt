            I bought this car for next to nothing in 1998 after graduating from college.  In the past 5 years, it has proven to be a great car.

Exterior : Considering the car is now 16 years old, the exterior looks pretty good.  The sky blue paint is still in good shape although it is starting to wear somewhat on the roof.  It used to leak a little around the windshield before I got after it with the RTV sealant.  Rust has been another concern.  The quarter panels are in pretty bad shape but can be easily fixed using Bondo.  Two of the jack pins have rusted off, but this can be worked around by using a notched 2"x4" board when jacking up the vehicle.  Replacement parts for this car are easily found at junkyards and scrap dealers, so routine annoyances such as losing a hubcap are not much of a problem.

Interior : The bench seats are generally comfortable but after long trips you are definitely ready to stand up for a while.  The Air Conditioner didn't work when I bought the car due to a number of leaks in the freon system, but I don't mind.  Opening all 4 windows works fine for me.  The radio worked fine but I installed an aftermarket unit because I wanted a tape player.  The heater is outstanding as is the defroster.  My car has the optional rear window defroster which also works extremely well.  The trunk is extremely roomy.  A full-size spare is kept underneath the trunk area.

Engine : This car has a 2.2 Liter Fuel Injected Engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission.  This car runs extremely well.  It starts on the first try every time and does not sputter, chug or smoke.  I usually put 5W-30 oil in for the winter months to make starting easier.  Changing the spark plugs and air filter as required are important and lead to much better performance.  It runs extremely well in snowy weather using normal all-season radials.  Its gear-ratio is well suited to winter weather as it does not tend to break the wheels loose at low speeds.  In dry weather, the car has acceptable acceleration and generally handles very well.  It has an exceptionally small turning radius and good brakes.  It typically gets about 23 MPG in the city and closer to 30 MPG on longer trips.  It runs well on normal 87 Octane gas but does appreciate the occasional bottle of fuel-injector cleaner

Reliability : In the 5 years I have owned this car, I have invested a bit of money into it.  Here are some of the more major repairs and the dates on which they occurred : 

5/1999  New brake pads, rotors and master cylinder
7/1999  New struts
6/2000  New fuel pump
4/2002  New gas tank, new left front axle

These repairs are not unreasonable given a car of this vintage.  Since April of 2002, the only money invested has been for an oil change.  This past winter has been particularly rough, so the car's excellent performance in the snow more than makes up for previous repairs.
