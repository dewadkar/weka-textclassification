            During the summer of 1996 my husband and I purchased a brand new Mercury Cougar. This car was wonderful and everything was great. It made us feel as if we were recapturing some of our disappearing youth and freedom.

Then about a year and a half later I discovered I was pregnant with my 3rd child.

We decided at the relief of my oldest son, who didn't want to ride the hump in the middle seat in the back. That there was no way we were all going to fit into this cougar and we needed something bigger.
We waited until the baby was born and then we made the trip to the dealership in search of a bigger car or sport utility vehicle.
We were determined NOT to ever get the dreaded MINVAN!

I was NEVER going to drive a minivan! 

I look back now and laugh at that statement because I couldn't imagine life without this wonderful van.

Well, as we shopped around, and looked for something that was spacious, easy to drive and we were able to afford, we found ourselves drawn more and more towards the minivans.

We decided early on that we wanted a chevy, My husband is PRO-Chevy so we started looking into the Ventures. I was so pleasantly surprised to discover how much room the venture offers.

Here are some of the benefits I have found from this van

5 wonderful doors. I really recommend that if you do invest in a minivan you go for the 5 door model. The ease of getting the children or your packages out of either side is wonderful. 
The way you can pull into a crowded mall parking lot and easily get your children in and out of their seats without having to worry about your door banging into someone else's, the way that you are able to shove everyone and everything into the side door if its raining and then buckle the kids into their seats without getting wet. All of these wonderful conveniences just from 5 doors.
Not to mention how easily the doors slide open and closed with little effort.

Lights
The lights in the van fade on and off when you open the doors which is wonderful to see what you are doing when you get in or out of the van at night. 
The headlights automatically come on when dusk approaches and turn off in the bright light. This feature is wonderful for a busy Mom like me who sometimes forgets to turn off the lights.


Seats
We opted for the extended van that offered seating for 8. Eight individual seats that we can move around any way we want. Its a Godsend that we are able to remove the middle seat so that I can put my children on each side and there is no seat in the middle, this cuts down on many fights that normally occur on long rides. You know the fights that start like: He's TOUCHING ME. She's LOOKING AT ME, He's SITTING TO CLOSE TO ME. Etc.
Now we have plenty of space between all of the children, and always extra seats for friends or other family members who want to go with us.
The seats are all comfortable captain chairs and there is plenty of leg room no matter where you sit.

Space
As I mentioned we purchased the extended van and there is tons of room behind the seats for shopping bags, or baby equipment, etc.
And this also makes entering or exiting the van very easy.

Becoming a minivan owner was a great surprise to me, even more so is the fact that I am singing the praises of being one.
But for the money you cannot beat the amount of room, comfort, and pleasure you get.


The only bad thing I can say about this van is that its not one of the most attractive things on the road.
But who cares when traveling with my 3 children and my husband becomes a pleasure<br><br>
