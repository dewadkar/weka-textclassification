            The Audi A4 1.8T Quattro, with all options except the sports performance one.  I love the car. I have had the car for just over a year now and I love it more now than when I first purchased it.  Besides the obvious styling which I think is first class, this car is fun to drive. I was looking at the Lexus and Mercedes as well as BMW but am so happy with my decision on the Audi.

Audi put in all the right options, like self dimming rear view mirror when a monster truck is behind you. Also the red display (classic Audi) is terrific at night). I will never forget the first time I saw the display.  I never saw it at night at the dealership.  Then all of a sudden I saw it the first night I purchased the car.  Incredible. There are so many hidden features built in - I could list them on 4-5 pages. Another example is the Sound adjustment on the stereo. If you are listening to a CD at a high volume and switch to radio, it adjusts the volume down first and slowly raised it to your previous setting.

The driving is what is most fun.  You definitely notice the Quattro in the snow.  It is very dependable in cornering and you really notice the difference in the all wheel drive. You feel very safe and like you can control the car in any conditions. This Audi handles and performs very well. I have an automatic with tiptronic.  I can switch over to manual shifting on the wheel (Porshe design) or with the stick shift. Its a lot of fun especially in the mountains or on curvy roads.

The safety features are very impressive. Airbags all over the place including the side air bags.  Even has hooks in the back for correct installation of baby seats. Audi makes the car very solid.  Just close the doors and you will see 
how well made the car is. It closes and seals tight.

When I purchased the car, there was a long wait for them. The sales person found a car with 2 extra options than what I wanted (the Bose Sound system and Xenon headlights) - He said I would not be disappointed. He was so right. It was so well worth it.  The xenons are awesome at night.

The stereo system (I purchased the Bose upgrade) is incredible.  You wont find a better system.  My only complaint on the stereo is that sometimes the BOSE has too much bass... and I cant figure out how the bass got reset higher ( no I dont have kids and I am the only one driving the car) - it mysteriously resets itself. 

Its a privilege owning the car. There are a lot of audi enthusiasts out there too! They will help you if you have any questions. I highly recommend a site called audiworld.com for questions on anything.
