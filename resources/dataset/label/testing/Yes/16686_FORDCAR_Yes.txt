            I owned a 1997 V6 Mustang that I was very proud of until a person I work with bought a 1995 twin turbo Supra.  Before that, I could easily keep up with his Mitsubishi 3000GT, but now he simply played with me.  Previously, I had thought about the Cobra, but for the money, I did not feel I was getting my money's worth.  Until 2003.  I read the reviews and finally decided to test one.  I traded my 97 for the 03 Cobra on the spot.

Now, the Supra guy trembles when he hears me coming.  The whine of my supercharger can only be described as primordial. I have not lost a street race yet, and that is with the car still stock from the lot.  Look at the numbers and you will know what I am talking about.  I have a conservative 380 horses under the hood and pushing around 400 lbs ft torque.

When you really get down to it, if you are reading this review you want to know if a TRUE American muscle car can beat the rice burners out on the street.  I can unequivocally tell you, it will eat those for breakfast on the straights and in the curves.  This baby hugs the road. I was like you and wondered if it would be worth it.  Don't hesitate.  Buy it. You will not regret it.

I only have one suggestion for Ford on the Cobra.  The interior reminds me too much of my 1997.  I would like to see the interior updated.  I would like to personally see the baby loaded with electronics instead of analog controls.
