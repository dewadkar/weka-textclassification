            I took possession of a c180 at the beginning of May and am still learning how to work all of the controls. Some of the nicer features are automatic lights and wipers. These function when required.

Little features, such as when you lightly flick the turn indicator, will cause it to blink 3 times. This is great for lane changes.

The six speed manual takes a bit of getting used to, I was used to changing from 5th to 3rd for sharp cornering, now its more like 6th to 4th. The traction control and ABS work a treat, though this car cannot be considered "quick".

The standard sound system comes with a single cd and radio with the aerial built into the rear windscreen. This is a neat design feature.

I'm not totally convinced by the automatically dimming rear view mirror, which can be quite bright at twilight. The folding side mirrors are great to play with, but I don't really use the feature.

I wasn't impressed with the fact that I had to buy floor mats as extra. Also, the right front fog light has misted up with water. This is going to be fixed under warranty. 

The lights come on when you open the car at night, one click opens the driver door, two clicks open all the doors. This is a security feature, as is the automatic door locking once you reach 5 miles per hour.

The car exudes quality, and is a real eye catcher. I'm convinced that I will be able to recover a good portion of my purchase price, but currently I don't have any intentions of selling. If you have a choice, avoid a silver one, they are the most common.
