            I purchased my 2002 Elantra new 1 1/2 years ago.  It currently has 16,000 miles.  I originally bought it for its price, features and warranty.

As other reviews have already commented, the 2002 Elantra is a great value for the money.  It has similar features to many more expensive models.  I especially appreciate its warranty.

Based on my experience, there are many things that I really like about the 2002 Elantra.  I enjoy the number of features that it has, especially the power windows and doors that many models of similar price do not come with.  I also appreciate its roomy interior.  Two adults and a child can fit comfortably in the back.  The 2002 also gets good gas mileage and is reliable.  I have had only one minor mechanical issue with this car, and the dealer fixed it promptly.

However, those thinking about purchasing this car should be warned that I have had multiple cosmetic issues with this car over the past year and a half (and I treat my cars gently).  These issues include the following: 1) The rubber edging has come off of 2 of the 4 doors.  2) A plastic bolt cover has fallen off the back of the passenger seat. 3) The right washer jet cover fell off, disabling both jets 4) The plastic interior of the car scratches and wears easily 5) There are multiple scratches on the hood of the car from simply wiping the snow off with a snow brush.  The dealer fixed the rubber edging and washer jet quickly and at no charge, however, they shouldn't have been issues on a new car.  Additionally, about 3 months after I purchased the Elantra, the engine light came on and stayed on.  The dealer said that it was a problem with the fuse and fixed it promptly, but it still cost me several hours of my time that I did not expect to spend on a new car.

I also purchased a 2002 Santa Fe at the very same time that I purchased the Elantra.  The difference in cosmetic workmanship on these two vehicles is like night and day.  Just looking at them both, you can tell that the materials in the Santa Fe are superior.  Even the stereos in both cars, which look very similar, are very different.  On a cloudy day, the stereo in the Elantra loses many of its channels.  The one in the Santa Fe does not.  Of course, the Santa Fe is a more expensive vehicle.  I guess that when you offer a car at such a low price, you probably have to skimp somewhere.  On the Elantra, it's definitely in the cosmetics.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this vehicle to others based on its value and reliability.  However, potential buyers should be cautioned to expect cosmetic problems as part of the package included with the low price tag.
