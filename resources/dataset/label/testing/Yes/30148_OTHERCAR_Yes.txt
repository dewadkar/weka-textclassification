            The 1985 to 1996 Corvette is a great buy for the money. I would stay away from the 1984 year car because of the Cross-fire injection. In 1985 Chevy went with the Tuned Port Injection (TPI). This motor is called the L-98 and in my mind is the best of the fuel injected motors. It has great low end torque and pulls great through the gears. Try to avoid the 4+3 manual transmission used from 1984 to 1988. The ZF 6 speed is much better. My 1990 Corvette has the 4 speed auto and is better than I thought it would be. I get 18 mpg city and 27 mpg freeway and that is driving it hard. The car handles great. After 1986 ABS brakes are standard. In 1990 Chevy changed the dash to a better looking wrap around style. If you are looking for a great car at a very very good price the C4 is the car to buy. Iam 6' 2&quot; tall, 250 pounds and have no problems on long trips.<br><br>
