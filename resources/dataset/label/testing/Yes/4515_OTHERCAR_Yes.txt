            I had been there, done that, bought the Tshirt on many used AMERICAN vehicles.  Needless to say, I was on a first name basis with AAA road service.  I was TIRED of breaking down, so I bought a new car in 1992:  that 92 Toyota Tercel.  It was economical to buy, for starters, but I didn't understand the real value of the car until 7 years later.  I drove this car EVERYWHERE, all the time.  It was a trooper and never EVER let me down.  It always started and the ONLY thing I ever had to do to it other than routine maintence was replace the thermostat...even the clutch is original....GOT to like that.  178,000 miles later, in 1999 (October), I sold my little red car and I have to tell ya, it was an emotional separtation for me not to mention scary.  I mean, would my next car be like my Tercel??  I bought a 93 Saturn SL2 after that w/63K miles on it....and that is story number 2 under SATURNS!!  :)  JUST BUY THE TOYOTA!!!   <br><br>
