            I have had my 1997 Camaro since December of 1997...and have had little or no problems with this beauty whatsoever.  It's a great ride.  I have always owned coupes and sportscars, and after having this powerful beast for almost 2 years, I can safely say that it was worth it!  I have had this car for several trips to and from Michigan from Florida, and never did I tire or become uncomfortable with it.  It has smooth handling (except perhaps in the rain, it does have a bit less control while hydroplaning).  <br><br>
