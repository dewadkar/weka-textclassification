            The new Toyota Celica has a radical design. Although, many may see the new design as radical or even outrageous. But don't let the design of the car prevent you from buying the car. The car has many other qualities that make it worthwhile to check out. I must say that I myself was drawn back when I saw the car. Although I am open to trying new things so I took one for a test drive. Unfortunately I did not get to drive the more powerful 180 horsepower GT-S model. I ended  up driving the lesser but still impressive 140 horsepower, 5 speed standard model. The car produced an ample amount of power and I was quite impressed with the acceleration of the car.

The design of the car is in fact especially important to the car because I later learned from a friend who works for Toyota development that the design is very aerodynamic. The design for the new Celica is partly for a new look but also for aerodynamics. The cuts in the hood and grooves provide for very minimal drag produced by the body of the car. Although I could not have determined the decrease in the drag of the car because of the design I did notice that the GT-S model only had a curb weight of 2425 lbs to 180 horsepower. If you do the math you will see that ratio of weight to horsepower is 13.8 to 1. The reduced weight of the GT-S provides for its great acceleration.

Although I have not heard of any negative connotations towards the new Celica I did notice that the trunk space was not ample. But as with most coupe sports cars the trunk space is limited. The interior also seemed a little tight but on the plus side the location of the gear box was good. Similar to that of the Mazda Miata the stick is located high and close to the driver to provide short throws between gears. The Celica is ideal for those who are willing to accept something unique and different, after all it is the year 2000. <br><br>
