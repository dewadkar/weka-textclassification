               I've owned an 89 Sentra and an 87 pickup and both Nissans served myself and my family well. Our 2000 Altima was purchased in May and we now have over 10000 miles on it. We are definitely satisfied with this car. The Altima has both good looks and great drivability.A 3000 mile trip up and down the East coast proved to be comfortable and economical. Our GXE has a manual transmission and gives us about 25 mpg around town and over 35 mpg on the highway.The front seats are very comfortable for both me at 6-1 and my wife at 5-1. The back seat is roomy for kids and just a bit cramped for adults.We have had two kids and one adult in the rear seat for numerous 100
mile trips with no complaints.
   Performance and acceleration are important to me, and I find both to be more than adequate. I've driven both the Accord and Camry 4 cyl. models and I find the Altima much quicker.Particularly at high RPM the power is impressive for a 4.
   Our Altima GXE came with everything except alloy wheels, leather, sunroof, or spoiler.The price was $15,200
  The only problems we have encountered are as follows:
    1. The front bumper is too close to the ground at about 4 inches and loudly scrapes on curbs and wheel stops.
    2. The door stops are too weak to hold the doors open on even a slight incline.
    3. With manual transmission there are no rear cup holders.
