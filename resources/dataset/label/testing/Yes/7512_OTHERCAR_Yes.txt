            I've never really been a big fan (ok, well, never a fan at all) of American-made automobiles.  I know there are some American made cars that are nice, but a majority of them aren't very reliable, sporty, fast, or...much to look at.  The Stratus, on the other hand, is an exception.  My girlfriend has recently purchased a 2000 Stratus, (like I said, I don't buy American-made cars) and though when I first found out I wasn't too pleased, I now have a higher respect for...for Dodge anyway.  The interior of the Stratus is what most impresses me.  My favorite part about it (excluding the awesome leather interior!) is the guage setup.  They are white, which gives the interior an amazing look, and there are quite a few guages (four to be exact) to give a sports-car enthusiast like me somewhat of an interest.  My girlfriend, Kayla, got it for the &quot;smooth ride&quot; of course (But for what it's worth considering that I drive an RX-7, I have to admit, it is a VERY smooth ride).  In addition, the car is fairly fast (for being stock, anyway).  It also has an auto-shifter, and though I haven't gotten the opportunity to try it out yet, (Kayla doesn't see that as such a great idea...I have no idea why) I'm sure it works quite well.  The only thing I would change about it is the range of motion.  To shift with the auto-shifter, you move it side to side, (left to downshift or right to upshift) but in my opinion it would be better, not to mention easier to move it up and down.  Anyway, I'm not complaining about it.  As of now, there have been no problems with the car whatsoever, and it is currently riding on its 12,786th mile.  That of course doesn't tell you much about its OVERALL reliability or how many miles it can go, but it does probably lessen your worrys about early problems.  And like mentioned by many others, I have to agree, the Stratus is VEEEERRRRYYYY roomy.  (So fellas, I reccommend this car for the ladies if ya know what I mean!) No, but seriously, no more worrying about squeezing 6 or 7 people in the car with ya or trying to position the seat midway between the front-seat passenger's head against the window, and the backseat passenger's knees against the back of the seat.  And the trunk is HUGE suprisingly enough!  That is one thing that I bow down to Dodge for.  Where do they get all that room!?  The car isn't even that big!  Overall though, the car is great...for being American-made...And although it's not much to look at, (for the sporty type like me anyway) it's not much to laugh at either...cuz you just might be the one getting laughed at when you eat its dust. It'll keep up with my RX-7...up until 120mph anyway! LOL...I would highly reccommend this car to anyone with needs for a roomy, fast, reliable, and nice looking vehicle.  Man or woman alike.  STRATUS- Sleek-Trusted-Roomy-Affordable-Tasteful-Ultimate-Safe.....GIVE ME A BREAK, I TRIED! <br><br>
