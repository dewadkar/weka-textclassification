            I researched this car for weeks before I bought it, so far the work has paid off.  I've just crossed the 10,000 mile mark and the car is trouble free.  I wanted to wait until I've driven the car for awhile to post my review.  In short, it's a great car, quick, fun to drive and reliable.

The 2.0 liter 140hp engine is quick off the line and quick when that passing power is needed.  I have the automatic transmission with overdrive and I'm getting about 25mpg city driving.  The a/c is great, I live in Phoenix, Az. and after 8 hours sitting in 112 degree sun the car cools off in about 5 minutes, my previous 2 cars (Chevy and Pontiac) never cooled when the temperature got above 105.  I assume the heater works good, but since I haven't used it I can not comment.  I upgraded to a CD player because it came with an improved stereo system.  The sound is great and no problems with the CD player.

The 14.5 gallon fuel tank is a little small.  I would like a little more  range for those long trips, but in the city it's good for a weeks worth of driving.

I could go on and on, but to sum it up, if you're looking for a compact car that is reliable, good looking and fun to drive, the secret is out, Hyundai Elantra is worth a look.
