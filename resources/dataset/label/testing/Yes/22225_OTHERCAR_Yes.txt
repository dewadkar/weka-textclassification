            Have you ever wanted to own a car that will make people's head turn as your driving down the street? Well, have I got a car that will not only make heads turn but make people see you as &quot;the Beauty of the Beast&quot;. Yes, Im talking about the BMW Z3 Roadster. This is one beautiful machine. Surprisingly the BMW dealer actually let me test drive one of these beauty this past summer. Lets just say I had to do a little acting. Hey! I think I deserve an oscar. 

With every car company coming out with their year 2000 model car; BMW could not resist themselves from releasing the Z3 Roadster 2000. The Roadster comes in six beautiful colors to add on to its many features. Leather interior is also an option but take into consideration that that will cost you a few thousand. The Z3 also comes with cd/radio player to play all you music while cruising down the streets. Along with the media play, the Z3 also has a great speaker system to enchance the sound that are coming out of your cd player or radio. To not keep you from enjoying your car with the frustration of selecteing CDs; the dealers also have disc changer option where you can add to you car. You will never have to keep looking for new cd. Simply put find your favorite dcs and place it in the changer and your on your way to enjoy your new car. The Z3 is manual transmission which makes it all that better. If you are not a person that likes driving a manual car; well you'll love this one. The gears are placed closer to each other like a racing car so your shifting is much easier and faster. Most of all, with a manual transmission you can really feel the power of this &quot;Beauty of the Beast&quot;. The base model Z3 comes with 170 hp which is better then any other car out there. If you want more power, look at the top model. The M Roadster 2, has 240 hp. The Z3 also comes with stock rims that will add to the great look that it already has.  Sorry folks,  but this car only holds two people, so chose your riding partner carefully. Everyone will want to get in this car with you. The car is very small and rides low on the ground. But, who cares; people will turn their heads to look at you.

There is so many options that you can do with this car. Lets say you have the car and want to boost up the power. Well, placing a racing intake and exhuast system will greatly inprove your car to even greater level of power. To add to the look you might consider buying a &quot;Shogan&quot; body kit for the car. All of this will only cost you extra, but if you are a car fanatic like me, you just might go the extra yard.
