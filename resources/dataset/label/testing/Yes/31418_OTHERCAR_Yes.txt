            I bought a 2001 Alero GLS coupe back in January '01.  So, I've been driving it the last 7 months and think I'm ready to write an opinion for you. First the exterior:  The Alero has nice, clean lines that appeal to me compared to the cladding used on the Grand Ams.  A negative is the air dam; you MUST always remember not to pull too close to parking blocks as they will catch the dam and possibly rip it.  The wheel wells bulge satisfyingly, and if you sprung for the performance package, the shiny 16" wheels look sharp.  The only complaint is there is space between the tire and wheel well top that looks unseemly (the wheels and tires look positively small in there).  The rear of the car is great; GM didn't use its Corvette butt here.  The rear glass is sloped sharply which might be a problem should you have lots of tall friends.  But it looks nice.  The interior: I own the coupe, so this is what the description applies to...
The seats are nicely padded and offer excellent thigh support.  back support is good; side bolsters are a bit weak for spirited cornering.  The leather is ok, not soft but smells good and looks really nice.  The leather trim on the doors is quite nice.  Even with the coupe, the back seats are really comfy; all my friends who've rode in back have commented on the comfort.  The gauges and displays are excellent, featuring oil-change lights and low tire-pressure warning lights too.  The front cupholder sucks for the big drinks it can hold as the buttons on the radio interfere with it.  As for the audio, I have the 8-speaker package and it rocks.  Bass is handled nicely by the rear 6 X 9s and the mids and highs sound good from the front tweets and 4 X 6 mids in the doors.  High range could use some improvement as the stock tweeters are shrill at high volume.  But if you notice these things like me, only an aftermarket system will really do.  The climate control system works great and the controls are straightforward.  The cruise controls are also great; they even light up at night!  The setup is similar to the Camry in that they are mounted as pods on the steering wheel.  Windshield wiper controls are unremarkable, they're fine.  Headlights operate automatically, but if you want to use them manually it is the stalk configuration.  Locks and windows are auto controlled, and the controls are fine.  Exterior mirrors are electric with the standard 8-way pad.  Interior complaints: the doors look and feel cheap with their flexible plastic coating.  There are some squeaks/rattles in the cabin when driving on rough country roads, but not many.  I also detest the seat belt holders mounted to the front headrests; they can't be removed as far as I can tell without some serious work.  The driving experience: The v6 is way smooth, although not the most powerful 3-liter plus engine out there, with its ancient 2 valves per cylinder pushrod design.  The car starts easily and idles smoothly.  Driving around town, the shifts are practically seamless from the slick 4 speed autobox.  The car also features a switch-defeatable traction control, which is great for rainy days.  Steering is GM power, which means you don't exactly feel the surface of the road.  But the speed sensitive assist tightens things up at speed.  Handling is sound with the optional handling package; the ride isn't too rough and the car corners nicely.  The suspension is 4-wheel independent.  The freeway ride is quiet and smooth and the car feels very solid.  There is plenty of passing power and the car is content to cruise at 80 mph+ speeds.  Off the line power is excellent with  its 210 lb-feet of torque twisting the wheels.  But not neck-snapping.  But the brakes with the standard ABS and 4-wheel discs make for short, quick stops.  Pedal feel is excellent with little if any fade.
