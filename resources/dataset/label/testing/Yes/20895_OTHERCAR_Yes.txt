            The 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser adds a new dimension to the Chrysler brand around the world by breaking the barriers of conventional automotive design and function. The all-new 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser complements the Chrysler brand vehicle line, while providing the potential to broaden the buyer base. Based on preliminary consumer research, the emotional appeal of the Chrysler PT Cruiser will have a similar affect on brand identity as do the Prowler for Plymouth and Viper for Dodge.  This vehicle is expected to have a huge presence in the marketplace.  Universal Appeal While Chrysler PT Cruiser was developed to meet vehicle requirements around the world and its combination of design and packaging is certain to appeal to people in every country.  &quot;With a personality unlike anything on the road today, Chrysler PT Cruiser will be unique in any environment around the world while transcending cultural differences,&quot; said Jim Holden, Executive Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing for North America - DaimlerChrysler. &quot;It will build on the momentum we created with the overseas introduction of the Chrysler 300M.&quot; Internationally, Chrysler PT Cruiser will reflect the individualism of consumers who are looking for a vehicle that is efficient for their daily transportation, while offering flexibility for their weekend and holiday travel requirements. This vehicle is for consumers who want to make a statement about their lifestyle and are not afraid to get noticed. Chrysler PT Cruiser will be sold in more than 40 markets around the world. <br><br>
