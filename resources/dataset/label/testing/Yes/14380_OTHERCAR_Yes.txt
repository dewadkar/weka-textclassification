            I've just been to the 2000 Philadelphia Auto Show and visited the Cadillac exhibit and can say without question I've seen my next car. I currently own two Cadillacs: a 1989 Brougham and a 1994 Sedan DeVille and they have both served me well. 

I always thought my 1994 DeVille made my Brougham look old-fashioned, well the new 2000 DeVille makes my 1994 DeVille look positively ancient. The new ergonomically designed interior blows the '94 away. The commanding dash makes my '94's look wimpy. The base DeVille is only 
$39,000 which is a downright bargain for a car of Mercedes S-Class standards and proportions. I'm also happy to see that the quality of a lot of the interior and exterior trim has improved since '94.

All this and a standard Northstar V-8 to boot! My '94 &quot;only&quot; has the 4.9 litre V-8 which itself is definitely no slouch. I will be doing 100 easily if I don't keep my eyes glued to the speedometer. I've driven a Seville with the Northstar V-8 and it's better than having sex! I would put a Northstar-powered Caddy up against my friend's 'Vette any day.

I also find the Raytheon-manufactured night vision system intriguing, but at $2,000 I'll wait a few years until all the bugs are worked out of it.

Some things I didn't like about the car was the fact that it is slightly small than my '94 and a few of the styling elements. The rear bumper has these button-like protrusions that look like old-fashioned bumper bolts like those on my 1968 Buick. The stacked headlights take a bit of getting used to. I guess GM was trying to capture a bit of the essense of the 1965-68 Caddies. The back end is attractive, but not as &quot;Cadillac-like&quot;
as my '94. It kind of reminds me of an '80s Lincoln Town Car. 

All and all, I'm positive that the 2000 DeVille will be my next car.<br><br>
