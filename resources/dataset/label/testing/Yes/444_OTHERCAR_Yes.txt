            I bought this camera because the Canon A70 was sold out everywhere I looked (even online). What stuck me was that here was a camera for $299 with a Leica lens! I still had to investigate it further. The specs were comparable with the A70, except the Panasonic's LCD display has higher resolution. Since specs may not tell the whole picture (excuse the pun), I thought I would buy it, take a couple of pictures and see how they turned out. It only took me a few shots to make up my mind. I tried all the different modes, all yielding very good (from a casual/family user perspective) pictures with no noticeable compression artifacts. Colors are accurately represented, perhaps a little on the vivid side (there are three color settings to choose from). The burst feature (see details section or Panasonic's website) is very nice and helps you get that chancy shot. If the lighting is strange, you can use an AE bracket feature which takes three shots each with a specified change in exposure. The movie mode is OK - a fun feature, but it's not a camcorder replacement. It's definitely adequate for shooting off a QuickTime clip to the grandparents. As far as the included 16MB card goes - well, I put that one to use in my Palm Pilot instead and got a 128MB card. When I bought my camera (at Circuit City) it also came with a mail-in offer for a free 128MB card (and 4 batteries) - not a bad deal. My only area of concern is the body. It has a light, plastic feel to it and the door covering the AV, USB, and power connectors is rather flimsy - I'm more or less waiting for the moment when one of the kids (or I) break that. Overall, though. I have been on a shooting frenzy and am delighted with the camera and the picture quality. I've been very happy with it so far. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have picked it again even if the A70 was in stock.
