            I've had my DC-5000 for about 6 weeks now, and I've shot about 100 miscellaneous shots in all resolution and compression modes.  So far, I'm really satisfied with my camera.  The quality of the shots I have taken is good - not quite as good as my Olympus 490 Zoom, but close - and the camera is very easy to use.  Sometimes the buttons are a bit tough to push, but I think that's just the price you have to pay for the weatherproofing on this machine.  I've ordered prints from Ofoto and the lower resolution prints were a bit grainy in the low-res mode (of course) but in high-res, the quality up to 4X6 was fantastic.  I haven't tried printing anything larger than 4X6 yet, but I'm sure I could get acceptable results up to 8X10.

The menu system is intuitive, the flash modes seem to be intelligent enough, the auto focus hasn't failed me yet, and there is adequate manual control for most 'point-and-shoot' people out there, which is most of us.

Battery life seems to be about average, but the included 8MB CF card isn't enough to store too many shots on high-res/best quality mode.  Two 'must-haves' for this camera, like most others, are at least a 32 MB flash card and some Ni-MH batteries.

I paid $255 for this camera with shipping, and so far I've had it skiing and ATV'ing, bounced it in my backpack and in the car. . .it's performed flawlessly (zoom has been fine, too) and I expect it to continue to, given the solid feel of it.

All in all, a fantastic value and a good rugged camera.
