            The Jeep Cherokee is basically an old model, but that doesn't matter it doesn't need to apologise, it offers larger than compact size with reasonable creature comforts.

You need the 4 liter engine in the sport, its just too heavy for the 2.5 motor. The 4wd offers both 2wheel, 4 wheel hi and 4 wheel low. The high range can be selected while moving up to 50mph.

Our vehicle is used, or rather abused by our 2 dogs (a boston terrier and a yellow lab). The tail gate lifts up as a single piece and the cargo area has a low lip for dogs to jump in or for loading. The back seat folds easily with just two latches

The Cherokee moves quickly to highway speeds and handles as well as can be expected for a workhorse 4x4 and has very respectable braking characteristics. Gas mileage is pretty good for this size and weight of vehicle and the jeep handles nicely in the snow of upstate NY

My wife loves her Jeep and so do our dogs, I find it a little tight to drive sometimes, but then I am 6 foot and 225 pounds. <br><br>
