            In searching for an SUV that answered our quest for comfort, style, spaciousness, and power, the 1998 Mountaineer won hands down.  We opted for the entire package, and were glad we did.  The interior is well thought out, and extremely comfortable for long hauls.  Leather seats, electric, full function CD/Cass stereo, Moon/Sun roof adjustable seats, window tinting, limited slip 4wheel drive... the whole enchilada.  
We took it up to Lake Tahoe last February during a big storm they had, and the Mountaineer handled extremely well, I never once felt it lose traction.  
We've had two minor recalls, and if I were to make any downside observations, it would be towards mileage.  It is certainly not a vehicle you want to &quot;romp&quot; on.  By taking it easy, I've gotten as much as 300 miles to the tank (17-18 mpg)
If I had a choice of vehicles, I would pick the same one, hands down.  I test drove the Dodge, and Toyota comparable vehicles, and felt extremely comfortable with the ride, and handling.
