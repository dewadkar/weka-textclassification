            This is my third corvette and its the best of the lot.  This car is the ultimate American sports car.  It's great fun to drive and it handles like a dream.  I named my corvette bluefire because of the color and the speed it can travel... But I never go above the speed limit!  

The corvette is a little pricey and repairs are expensive.  I had to replace one of the run-flat tires (expect to pay about $500.00) and I have a had sensor problem that it took the dealer two trips to find and fix but that was under warranty.

The ride of this vehicle is not like the old corvettes, this one is smooth , as smooth as any ride can be when you are only a few inches off the ground.  This car is great fun and I hope to be driving one well into the next century.<br><br>
