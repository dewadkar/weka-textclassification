            Checking back in with an updated review of my 1999 Cougar. (First review March 99, Purchased 12/99)  I simply cannot find anything wrong with this car, as hard as I try.  Well...not enough to warrant alarm in anyone.  I have taken this car to the opposite ends of the scale on usefulness.    

My practicality listings are below.  Not found in Motor Week, Car and Driver, etc.

Will hold an 2 x 4 x 8, with the hatchback closed.

Infant and child car seats do not do well in the rear of this vehicle.

Although listed as a car to interest the 30-40 year old bracket, make sure you do not have to get in and out of the back seat very often.  (Under 30 should not be much of a problem.) 

Although smoking is not a good thing, it is a very bad thing in the back seat of the Cougar, as there is no ashtray receptacle.  A coffee can works well.

You will have a bad hair day if someone opens the window slightly and you are in the back seat of this car.

Driving slow can be fun.  This causes less of an interest to the local law enforcement and keeps those wanting to race you, far ahead of you.  Learn to drive the Cougar as you would a mint condition Corvette.  Once you get the hang of it, you will consider it an asset.

Incidentally, after talking with several law enforcement friends from different areas of the country, I have learned that the Cougar especially red, are targets of theirs.  I know this personally.

For several months, I avoided automatic car washes, for fear I would hurt the paint, etc.  I can now advise you on this.  Do not pay the extra for the blow dry at your local car wash, unless you want to hear your antenna slap wildly on the roof of your car.  If you are unprepared for this ahead of time, you will be prepared the next time.  It is a noise you will never forget.  Other than that, the car did not sustain any damages and cleaned nicely.  No brushes in this car wash, so I cannot advise on any others.  High pressured water only. 

Unbelievable gas mileage.  During our midwest gas price hikes, I monitored the mileage by the minute.  This car does extremely well in town and on the highway.  In stop and go traffic, with the A/C on, I average 17 MPG.  On the highway, with the A/C on, at an average speed of 70 MPH, I average 33 MPG.  I cannot complain in the least.  I use 89 Octane fuel.  Even at $2.02 a gallon, I take care of my kitty.

True, I have not listed the specs as you would find on every 'motor-minded' information page.  I have listed real world experience in this car as I would like to know if I was buying one.  Specs are great, but real information in the real world is better for me.
