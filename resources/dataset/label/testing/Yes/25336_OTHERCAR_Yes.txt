            The DOHC V6 engine provides more then enough power for most anything that you could want to do (haven&#146t tried toeing with it). The handling and control are outstanding (now &#150see next sentence). The wet traction left some to be desired but after changing to high performance tires that was no longer an issue. I would like for it to have rear disk brakes but the drum brakes do a good job. There is a little road noise, not enough to get on your nerves, but it will vary depending on the condition of the car, the suspension and the tires. It would be nice if it had a full sized spare tire which after raising the floor of the trunk to accommodate a full size tire can be put in place of the smaller spare. If you are a do it your self type of person, then changing the oil is not as easy as it could be since the oil filter is in a tight position which makes it more difficult to get off and on. I have read several reports of the water pump failing after about 50000 miles and I have over 52000 miles on mine and no problems yet. In city MPG is about 18 to 19 with aggressive driving while on the highway I average around 23 to 25 MPG depending on traffic.

Has a lot of storage space for everyday things and even for light to moderate moving. The back seat is good for shorter people, kids and to put things for transport. The front seats will fit most people just fine, even if they are taller like me (6&#146 4&#148). Everything is right there within your reach. Would be nice if the rear windows were to roll all the way down instead of just half way.

The standard factory CD player does an OK job but only plays CD-Rs about half of the time and I haven&#146t been able to get it to play CD-RWs. The Audio that comes out is OK for everyday listening but if you want good sound then you will need to change the standard factory speakers and head unit (receiver/radio).

Too bad it is not made anymore.
