            	The 2004 Acura TSX is no RSX in handling, or TL when it comes to luxury; but it strikes hard where automotive critics claim it lags far behind: BMW&#146s top selling 3-series line-up. I personally was in the market for a 325i until I visited Acura&#146s web site -- and was sold on the TSX almost instantaneously. The list of features is extensive and everything is standard except a GPS Navigation System.

	The TSX is not a brand new model, per se. It is rather a new face to a Japanese and European Accord model that has been in each respective market since 1998. Due to its lengthy production history, reliability is expected to be top notch!

	Visit Honda&#146s web site for the United Kingdom to compare features between the American and British model. Note that there&#146s more in the specifications than the gallery shows.

<b>My Car</b>

	The TSX under review here is a Nighthawk Black Pearl with a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift mode, and GPS Navigation System.

<b>Options</b>

	Both 6-speed manual and automatic transmission models share the <b>same price</b>. The only option available on the TSX at this time is the $2,000 Navigation System. Of course, accessories such as gold-plated emblems, license plates, key rings, etc. also exist.

	I highly recommend the Navigation System! There is <b>no monthly fee</b>, and the vehicle keeps track of its location through a 24-satellite Global Position System maintained by the United States government. Based on experience, it is accurate within + or - 25 feet.

<b>Navigation System Features</b>

- 8&#148 LCD screen
- Touch screen
- DVD-based and upgradeable with a PC card sold by Acura/Honda
- Database includes <b>entire U.S.A.</b>
- Includes business addresses and phones, all major highways, streets, and points of interest (i.e. Sea World, Statue of Liberty, stadiums, etc.). Finding a gas station is easy! It even indicates what brand is which on the map.
- Voice activated controls, with male or female voice feedback

<b>Cool Features I like about the TSX</b>

- 17&#148 7-spoke wheels with Michelin Pilot tires (some models feature Dunlops)
- 360-watt sound system with 8 speakers, separate amp, and 6-CD in dash changer
- 4-wheel disk brakes with ABS
- Automatic preset of radio stations: 12 FM and 6 AM, or manual setting
- Big and medium size cup holders are in front of the center console; out of the way from stereo and air controls
- Blue lighting throughout the cabin, using bulbs and LEDs
- Center console has a coin holder and 12-volt power outlet for cell phone or other toys
- Dual climate control
- Fast reacting cruise control
- Headlights turn OFF automatically after you leave the vehicle, so the battery will not drain if you forget them on
- Heated seats (yet to test, since it is 90 F here in San Luis Obispo)
- Home Link Wireless Control of up to 3 garage doors
- Ignition switch light (no scratching around)
- Leather is standard feature, not optional
- Moonroof (up/down and slide)
- Navigation System updates clock as you travel across different regions of the country (and it keeps it &#147on time&#148)
- Outside temperature gauge (on front bumper)
- Place to hold sunglasses & keep them from getting scratched
- Rear air vents for feet
- Sliding center console armrest reaches up to you
- SportShift mode in automatic transmission responds very fast (compared to Audi/VW Tiptronic that lags a bit)
- Steering wheel buttons for cruise control, audio volume, CD/FM/AM mode, and navigation voice commands
- Vehicle Stability Assistance traction control (never needed it)
- Very fast, quiet, and effective A/C
- Voice-activated navigation, AC, stereo, trip computer, and other features
- Trip computer resets automatically after each refuel (driver can turn off and reset at any time)
- Upper display provides resume of audio, air, and time when LCD screen is turned OFF and for faster & easier access to important information.
- Xenon lights spread over 3 lanes on each side and illuminate the road like daylight (well, almost). I love them and highly recommend the extra cost (standard on the TSX).

	In addition, mileage in this vehicle has been higher than expected for a 200 HP 2.4-liter engine: 30 mpg highway and 24 mpg 50% hwy / 50% city.

<b>Features Missing in Action</b>

- A more powerful subwoofer: 6&#148 x 9&#148  speakers in the rear don&#146t have much punch
- Auto-leveling xenon lights: big safety feature standard on most models with HID systems
- Automatic up and down on passenger window: VW and Audi models have this standard, makes closing vehicle easier and faster
- Daytime Running Lights (only standard on Canadian models)
- Heated side mirrors: a must for frosty mornings
- Keys and remote should be one unit, like VW, Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, and others
- Lighting on steering wheel buttons: <i>Where is the cruise button?</i> (in the dark)
- Lock tabs on doors should lock at 10 mph; and unlock automatically when driver and passengers pull on handle (standard on 2004 TL, VW models)
- Lock tabs on doors should be recessed so driver and passengers can place arm on door (standard on VW models)
- Low fuel buzzer: keeps me from walking home!
- No head restraint in center rear seat
- More options on voice tone on navigation system (more sensual perhaps?)
- MP3 Player ($500 option)
- One-touch moonroof control: less time hand is away from steering wheel
- Power passenger seat: especially height adjustable feature, small people will feel <i>really small</i> in these seats.
- Sun visors have no extensions to hide sun at odd angles

	If you noticed all the references to Audi and VW, it&#146s because I used to drive a 1999 New Jetta GLS. My mom also owns a 2000 A6, my brother a 2003 GTI, and my dad a 2000 Golf GLS. We also own a 1996 4Runner -- the most reliable of the bunch.

<b>Performance</b>

	As I mentioned earlier, the TSX has an i-VTEC engine with 200 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque. The engine has enough power to spin both FWD tires on the very high first gear, even with the automatic transmission. I&#146ve been learning how to prevent this as it certainly wears down the tires. (My 2.0-liter Jetta never spun both tires off the line.)

	In terms of driving, the horsepower is enough to reach 135 mph (electronically limited) with the Z-rated tires (150  mph); however I have not tried anything like it. I just read about other people&#146s experience in their TSX (see sources at the bottom). If you are caught going over 100 in California, you are arrested for reckless driving and given 2 points on your record. That would get me fired from my law enforcement job...

	Regarding the low torque compared to the 200 hp, it doesn&#146t affect driving since 90% of the torque is available early on at less than 3000 rpm. Peak is at 4,500 and the engine redlines at 7,100. The only curious thing is that, due to the relatively flat torque curve, the rate of increase in speed doesn&#146t change substantially when speeding up at the freeway on ramp.

	As the automatic transmission is designed for mileage, I have only seen the engine redline once. Passing, however, is easy and changing lanes is very secure. The TSX takes freeway on ramps and off ramps of 270 degrees at 35-40 mph and remains flat on the ground, with very small roll. I&#146ve never heard the tires make a hint of noise or slip up.

	Under steering is not noticeable.

<b>Comfort</b> 

	The TSX is very comfortable, especially in the driver&#146s seat. The adjustable lumbar support keeps my back where it wants to be, the side supports -- though not as good as in the GTI -- allow me to maintain control of the car in every turn, and the adjustable (telescope and tilting) steering wheel makes finding a good position easy. Other adjustments -- height, sliding, and rear seat tilt -- are electric powered.

	Visibility is hindered a little by the large center mirror, yet I love how it dims automatically when headlights strike it at night. It really works! Except when the sun hits it -- I don&#146t know why.

	Meanwhile, the right seat -- while a bit low -- has plenty of leg room. Adjustments are manual only, and exclude height.

	All the lights on the instrument cluster remain ON whatever the time of day, ensuring all the important information is always easy to read and readily available. I specially like the white, red, and blue colors. They remind me of the setup used in Audi&#146s and VW&#146s.

	In the rear, there are two pockets for storage, two cup holders, and a center armrest. It fits three, but lacks a center seat head rest.

	Furthermore, the rear seatbacks fold down in 40/60 fashion. The extra space is <b>gravely</b> reduced by the two extensions from the side of the vehicle that prevent wide objects from being fully accommodated. My full-suspension bike by GT, for example, fits in but is suspended in the air by the extensions. I&#146m saving money to buy a roof rack.

	In addition to the extensions, both seatbacks don&#146t fold down all the way. I&#146m not sure why that&#146s the case seeing as the European model has fully-reclining seatbacks. (See awesome TV ad linked at the bottom.)

<b>Safety</b> 

	Regarding safety, the features speak for themselves:

- 4-wheel ABS
- Front airbags
- Side airbags (on seats)
- Side curtain airbags (not on Canadian model -- ???), extends all the way to rear seats
- Vehicle Stability Assistance traction control

<b>Conclusion</b>

I love my TSX. It has 3,400 miles now and it is fun to drive, safe, and reliable.
