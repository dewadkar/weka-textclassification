            There are great driving cars and there are great looking cars. And then there are cars that are both: The Audi A4. In North America the A4 is available in a 150-hp turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and a 190-hp V6. Engine options outside of North America include a 2.4 liter V6, 1.9 liter turbocharged TDI and a 2.5 liter V6 TDI. 
Both of the North American models (1.8T and 2.8) utilize a new technology that is as dependable as it is advanced: the 5-valve engine. Audi's five-valve engine gives top-notch performance with low fuel consumption and exhaust levels. 
With available features such as quattro all-wheel drive and Audi's Tiptronic transmission, as well as the choice of a sedan or Avant body style, there is an A4 configuration for everybody. 
New for the A4 in model year 2000: in-dash CD player, a new color (India Red), updated interior color-combinations and optional packages including features such as xenon headlights and the Audi Navigation System. 
New standard features include revised instrument cluster lighting with improved white lighting with red pointers and a digital clock with date (that is fully Y2K compliant). The 6-funtion Trip Computer is now a standard feature and the new Audi Symphony radio with in-dash CD player is also standard. 2.8 models now come standard with a power passenger front seat. The Tiptronic automatic transmission's programming has also been revised to improve performance. 
New optional equipment for the 2000 A4 are Xenon Headlights ($500) and the
Sideguard head airbag system ($300). An updated Convenience package ($1200) now includes the Homelink transmitter and auto dimming mirrors, and the Sports Package ($750 1.8T, $400 2.8) now comes with new 10-spoke 16&quot; wheels. Also for the 2000 Audi models is the new Audi Navigation system ($1100) which uses the trip computer and voice commands to indicate directions and is accessed by controls located in the center console. CD-ROM's for the Navigation System are located in the trunk.
