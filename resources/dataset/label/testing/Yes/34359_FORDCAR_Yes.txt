            My husband and I purchased our <b>Ford Taurus</b> because our previous car was too small to accommodate the third child we were expecting. My husband refused to buy a mini van so we compromised on a larger family vehicle. 

There are many things that I love about this car. It drives and rides very smoothly. I also like the fact that it's a quiet ride. In my previous car, even with the windows completely up, the outside noise was overwhelming. The <b>Ford Taurus</b> is the perfect vehicle for a family with 2 or less children, but it does not comfortably seat a family of five. My six year old sits cramped in the back seat between two car seats. Even if our toddler and infant were not in safety seats, they would all still be shoulder to shoulder.
 
An aspect I like with the <b>Taurus</b> is the huge trunk and the fact that the back seat lays down for convenience when carrying something large around. 

Overall it is a great vehicle. I think it is perfect for the travelling businessman(woman) who needs a comfortable, enjoying ride on a long trip. It is also the ideal car for the average family (2 kids). It just does not accommodate a larger family.<br><br>
