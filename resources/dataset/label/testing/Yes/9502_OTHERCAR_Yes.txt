            I bought one of the first ones on the market... a 1994 4 wheel drive with the SLT package. One hell of a truck. Rides like a car. Nice throaty exhaust. Sitting way up high you get a commanding view of the road.
It sits 3 adults very comfortably. It's great on long distance rides.
I absolutely love it. I have had my share of problems with it. 
Two transmissions were replaced early on. The second within a week of the first. (It was junk strait from the factory!) The third transmission has been great as has been Chryslers willingness to service all problems, I recommend them highly. I had a Rhino liner sprayed into the bed and it
also was a very good choice.
