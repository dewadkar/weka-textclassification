            I own a 1990 Acura Legend, generation one, last year (1999).  It has a 2.7-liter v6 165 Horsepower engine.  It�s a great car with 135k miles on the original engine and transmission.  I bought this car because I wanted a car that would get my comfortably to work and back, for an affordable price.  In this Legend I found one.
 This car has enough power to getup and go.  It has good merging acceleration (10-60 Mph) The engine has last a long time, I've replaced a few of the tubes and wires that were wearing out, but so far I haven�t had any problems with the engine.  It�s loud enough to let you know it�s working right, but not loud enough to interrupt your driving.
 It has a great soft suspension, very smooth and comfortable.  The only problem is the ride doesn�t let you feel the road much.  This can be changed for an extra $150.
 The seats are very comfortable.  I have infact slept in the drivers seat a few times when I was stuck in the snow.  There is enough room for 5 people comfortably.
 The legend comes stock with a good sound system, the head unit shorted out on mine when I spilled some coffee on it.  The speakers are decent quality, and with a 50watts x 4-channel output, the speakers will start to make a little noise, and pump out some bass.  This is changed if you have the Bose system (which I did not).
 Surprising, the Legends are fast and easy to modify.  There are many website that give Legends a cult following, and show you how to do things yourself to change if your budget is small. (Or you just like to do it yourself)
 Did I mention its durable? Well if I haven't, it is very.  I have taught my son to drive in this car.  He has hit more things and done no damage then you could believe.  Cones, Stop signs, rocks, curbs, speed bumps, bushes.  And the only damage is minor scratches to the paint.
 If you�re buying a legend and have a choice of a 90 or 91, get the 91.  I later found it its worth the extra thousand bucks.  The second-generation legends (starting in 91) have upgraded everything on the legend, more power, better turning, and better sound system. But if you can�t get the second generation the older ones are still great cars.
 Compaired to the other luxury sedans, and coupes I have been in the legend is up there.  It is just as good as a 5 series, it just doesnt have the name.  It costs less then most cars compairable to it.  Newer Maximas and Camrys dont have the balance the Legend has.  Maxima has the power but not the great comfort, Camry doesnt have the performance, but it has almost the comfort.  So if I made my decision again id buy my same 1990 Acura Legend.
