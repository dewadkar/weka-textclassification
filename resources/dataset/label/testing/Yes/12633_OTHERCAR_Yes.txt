            I think this is a fantastic camera. Photo quality is just fantastic both indoors and out, it feel solidly built, is very easy to use, both as a beginner and as an advanced user.

It has S-Video out so you can use it as a camcorder if you connect it to your VCR, USB so transferring pics to your PC is a breeze, and many options to make the best use of your memory card, ie low quality small pics so you can take loads or high quality large pics - larger but fantastic quality.

The LCD is very cool too - it helps you take perfect pics and when you have taken them you can view the pics you have taken and zoom in to make sure the quality is good. The optical zoom is very good too, though the digital zoom is best avoided as the pics come out a bit grainy.

There are a couple of downsides though. Battery life is very poor - you really have to be careful and basically switch on, take the photo and switch off if you're gonna be away from mains power for any length of time. Also, there is a delay between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken, so those snatched photos arn't really possible.

Overall though, I am very happy with my purchase and the downsides can be avoided if you are aware of them.
