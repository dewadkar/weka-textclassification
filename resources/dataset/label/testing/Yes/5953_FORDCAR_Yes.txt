            I recently purchased my Expedition. EB about a month ago, and it's the best investment I ever made.
Being 36 and recently retired I wanted to purchase my "pre" midlife crisis auto.
It was between a Prowler, BMW, or the Expedition. Needless to say I went with the Expedition.
I purchased this fully loaded. It took about six weeks for the truck to be built. The entertainment system is great, especially if you�re like me and have a six-year old who is always asking "are we there yet�. At first the system didn't work to well, the sound didn't come over both sides of the wireless headsets, but Ford fixed the problem. We bought a power inverter and hooked his Playstation up to the truck. Now he doesn't want to get out!
Gas mileage is horrendous, I get about 9+ miles to the gallon. Living in NYC it's very difficult to get good mileage. But we're driving down to Fla. soon, so I will get to see the real mileage.
The pick-up is great in the 5.4 L engine. I find the slightest lag at first, but I pick right up! Room is fantastic, especially with the third row. Cargo organizers are a must; we went with "Cargo-Loks". When you wash the vehicle or use the luggage rack a wheel step is needed. I found a good deal on the Internet and got a factory one for $60 with free shipping. I purchased other alarm keypads and transponder keys on eBay for about $10. The keypads are easy to program yourself, and the transponders can be programmed at any Ford dealership after you have them cut. The Class III Trail Hitch was another option that I picked up. Planning to buy a boat shortly, I felt the best is better. The skid package gives piece of mind that the under carriage will be safe from flying debris from the roadway. Having been a highway patrolman, I found this to be a "wise" investment, having seen what the smallest debris had to the largest of vehicles.
The CD player is in the center console with the VCR, very convenient, and has a six - change CD magazine. The A/C and heat can be either controlled for rear passengers from the front compartment or the rear. Passengers can used wired headphones in the rear if they wish to listen to the radio or CD if the front are listening to a separate device. The passengers CANNOT use the radio to listen to another station if the front is listening to the radio; this is the same for the CD.
This truck is high off the ground, but the handles in the front compartment give you something to grab in order to assist you in the vehicle. The rear sensing system is great, it beeps to let you know your coming close to an object, the faster the beep the closer your getting, at a steady beep it means your about to fix the truck.
I love it, and never though I would say that about a Ford. Most novelty accessories I purchased, I bought from eBay for reasonable prices.
