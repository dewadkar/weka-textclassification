            <b>Do you know why a guy like Shaq O'Neal may despise and end up spitting on a Roadster?  'Cause he won't be able to fit all his long frame in one despite his millions?</b> (Just an ice-breaker!)

I will tell you the truth about this S2000 (TT Roadster). My test drive did not go well either. It was not a small task at all.  Having been blessed with (well) a set of long legs that send me perching to about 6'5&quot;, I had some trouble fitting all that frame into this small frame.  I managed to slide the seat back a bit.  Off I drove into the sunset!  What makes this car so hot?


First things, the TT Roadster is not like the vibrant and raving X5 that most upward mobile, upstart entrepreneurs were throwing around to entice new engineers and programmers.  Honda S2000 is in a class of its own.  It takes well to the road and shows some type of achievement.  In fact, it makes other drivers turn their head.  The demand has been so high that some industry insiders are already thinking about some type of back order.  You can imagine that some dealerships may not have at all.  It may take a bit longer to get yours.  You may have better luck placing an order for one online.

If you are the right fit for this vehicle and decide to dig for one, here is what you should know about it:

The Roadster is available in three versions.  You have a 180-hp with front wheel-drive, a 180-hp with the Audi quattro all-wheel-drive system and the 225-hp quattro.  What does the quattro system do?  It adds weight and takes some trunk space.

Depending on which one you decide to go with, the Roadster has some cool features that you will appreciate a lot.  It can go up to 60 miles per hour in less than 7 seconds.  It has a 240 horsepower with 1153 lbs of torque.  If you have some lead feet, you know you are in trouble!  Don't hope a cop spots you taking in the cool breeze of the coast like this, though!

**Additional features:

--Pulsed radar anti-theft system.  You don't have to worry about someone reaching in to do something stupid in your car.

--Stainless-steel rollbars (Now, these are necessary!)

--Power glass rear windbreak (Optional)

--Leather upholstery etc.

Are you ready to rev your engine up to 9000 rpm?  No worry, it will handle it.  By the way, the MPG in city is 20 and on FWY, it's 26.

Enjoy your vacations and the fruit of your hard work!<br><br>
