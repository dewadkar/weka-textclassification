            This review is on the 2001 Mazda B3000 DS (Dual Sport) truck I bought in July. It has about 16,000 miles on it now and I am pleased with my decision.

To calibrate you, let me tell you that the truck I bought was a special DS package. It includes the standard features listed, cloth seats, tilt wheel, cruise control, split rear window, deluxe radio, bed liner, interior lighting, etc. It does not have the power option of power windows, door locks, mirrors, etc. I drive it about 600 miles a week at highway speeds mostly. My son is a mechanic so I get better than average service and price for the routine maintenance required.

I researched heavily in the small truck category before deciding on the Mazda. It is essentially a twin to the Ford Ranger with mostly cosmetic differences. I went to the dealer with my wants already pretty well known so time wasn't spent deciding on features and haggling.

My general impression after six months is that this is a solid, well engineered, and carefully assembled vehicle. The ride is very good for a truck with a little of the off-road heritage of a four-wheel drive. The wheel base of the extended cab helps in this respect. The V6 engine gets the truck up to highway speeds quickly through the 5 speed automatic transmission. The transmission shifts smoothly. I generally have to look at the RPM gauge to be sure of what gear I am in. Road noise is acceptable at highway speeds. The truck is tight with no rattles or squeaks.

Since I drive mostly on open roads in light traffic, I really appreciate the cruise control. Have you ever noticed if you want to pop over a hill and find a slow vehicle in front of you, all you have to do is engage cruise? That seems to be my experience anyway. A light tap of the ABS brakes disengages it and a quick push of the RSM (resume) button brings it back on line.

Speaking of the anti-lock brakes (ABS), I have three vehicles with ABS, Ford F-150 and Chrysler convertible. This ABS is the best of the three. I had the opportunity to make a quick stop on packed snow the other day - actually a vital need. A little easily controllable fishtail at first was all I noticed. No skidding. The deer made it across without becoming my hood ornament.

Nothing is perfect and the Mazda isn't an exception. The gauge for the 19.5 gallon fuel tank reads empty and the warning light comes on at under 16 gallons of usage. With the 21 mpg average I am getting with this truck (highway driving remember), the safe range between fill-ups should be about 400 miles. The d*** gauge drops it to under 350 unless I track with the trip odometer.

The truck also seems to be a rock collector. My first day of ownership was marked (marred?) by a truck tossing a rock to me which the windshield caught. Brand new toy with a crack in the windshield at 31 miles on the odometer. Has to happen some time, but why the first day? A few hundred miles later, I got a very loud and frightening squeal that seemed to be associated with the brakes. A quick trip to the car doctor revealed the front left disc had collected a rock and was polishing it.

The only other problem I have is that the overdrive button on the shift stalk pops the car out of overdrive sometimes when shifting to drive. An irritant but the O/D light comes on to let me know. The truck has full gauging that is reasonably accurate as far as I can tell.

The radio is good. It picks up stations which I can't get in the Ford and plays the music cleanly and pleasantly. The ability to slip in a CD is a nice touch. Things in general are well laid out for easy access while driving. Warning sounds are there for forgetting to take keys out and leaving lights on or turn signals going but they don't get in the way. That isn't as true for the seat belt warning system. This car is definitely a wife. It nags me every minute or so until I put the belt on.

The windshield wipers vary their speed in the intermittent mode based on driving speed, a nice touch. The washers work okay but get a little squashed down at highway speeds.

Mechanically I just don't have anything to complain about. The engine is quiet and well mated to the rest of the drive train. All I have had to do so far is routine maintenance. 

I get asked why I got a truck with off road type suspension and two wheel drive. The dual sport has the higher clearance of a four-wheel drive without the penalty of hauling around the extra weight and maintenance headaches. The main advantage is road view, much better than a typical two-wheeler. I live in an area where four-wheel is only rarely needed or useful so why buy the extra pain? Of course, the down side of a higher ride is easier rollover from the higher center of gravity. I keep this in mind when cornering.

Why the extra cab room when usually I'm the only one in it is another question I get. It saves the hassle of a tonneau cover. I can carry stuff inside out of the weather. It's sort of my trunk. And it does have a couple of drop down seats for emergency hauling (short distances) of extra passengers. I wouldn't count those seats if you have a need for regular riders much over eight years old.

One of the main concerns I had was the ability to haul lumber and plywood in the six foot truck bed. I am pleased to report that I have handled multiple sheets of MDF and twelve foot boards with no problems. I just use the multiple tie down points and the pre-formed grooves in the bed liner to keep it still. A red flag keeps the law happy.

If I haven't said it clearly up to now, I am happy with my choice. I may be less happy when it comes time to sell it. The Ford Ranger would have been better in that regard.
