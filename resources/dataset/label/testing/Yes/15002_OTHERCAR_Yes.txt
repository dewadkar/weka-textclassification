            As a webpage developer, there is nothing better than being able to take a picture and have it up on the web for all to see.  This camera makes that all too easy.  With many different options to allow for different lighting situations, backgrounds, and subjects, this camera does it all for a very reasonable price.  

Another thing it helps out with is online auctions.  Being a very active seller on eBay, this camera makes auctions more profitable by allowing for pictures of the items I'm selling.  All you have to do is get some Geocities webspace, and the pics can be taken, uploaded, and placed into your auctions within minutes.  

There's really not much negative about this camera.  The battery lasts a long time, it's compact enough to fit in a pocket, and the pictures come out great.

All in all, this is the best purchase I've made in quite some time.<br><br>
