            On November 7, 1997, I committed to selling my faithful 1988 Honda Accord DX 5-speed. Gosh, I miss that car.

My father, the mechanic, was adamant about me choosing from a 1997 Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Saturn SL2, and the Nissan Sentra. After ruling out the first two due to pricey dealers, I drove the SL2 but, since I'm a large guy, my knee kept hitting the console and ... moving it. So, Sentra-bound I became. I drove both the standard and the automatic, which were only about 700 dollars in difference, but chose the automatic because the clutch took up too much valuable foot-rest space.

I can't say that the Sentra as purchased off the lot was the most attractive car, or ... that attractive at all - the hubcaps were plain, the aerodynamics left some things to be desired, and the pinstripe down the side does look a little silly. However, it was and is very comfortable and sturdy (apart from minor dings caused by parents and hoodlums).

I've had the car for ... slightly over 2 years and put 54,000 miles on it. I have not had to put it in the shop for anything apart from routine maintainance. I can't say I've been completely angelic to the car - I've gone against my father's wishes and .. not changed the oil as frequently as I should have, driven it very low on gas, yet all I've had to do is change the filters, oil, and get a brake job and I'm good to go.

The drive is mostly smooth, but a little bumpy at times and you catch a little vibration off the road on some highways at speeds up to and above 75, but it's not enough to anger you. Gas mileage varies - in the city, I usually get 24-26 MPG, whereas on the highway I get 32 or 33 - a bit off the 28/36 mark on the tag. Pickup has always seemed to be good and, as per the rest of the mechanical functions of the car, I have no complaints.

The stereo in the GXE is just plain lousy. The speakers are weak and tend to blow very easily, and the sound on the tape deck is unacceptable. If you're picky and go on many road trips like I do, buy a midrange Clarion head-unit and two pair of -slim- 6 1/2&quot;S (oversized width) speakers for the front doors and rear deck (if you do not get the 6 1/2&quot; S models you will be either drilling or banging your head against the door wondering why the screwholes don't match up - neither of which are pleasant thoughts). Your sound will improve an infinite amount.

Here's the bottom line : if you don't mind people laughing about the stubbyness of the back-end of your car and remarking that &quot;your car has a big tochis&quot;, nor having to replace the stereo from the get-go, it's a truly affordable and dependable bet.
