                 I bought a 1998 Isuzu van (OASIS) at the end of the year's run.  
     The car runs well, has approximately advertised mileage, and drives acceptably.  On the other hand, the internal arrangement and capacity feels more like a station wagon than a van.
     The car is made by Honda, but carries a longer warranty than the Honda.  The engine is 4 cylinder - revs well with enough power, but under a full car load is a bit slow.  The luggage carrier (by the back window) is deep with good volume, but is a bit narrow for luggage.  Of course, if you keep things in the back (like we do), there is a problem when you fold down the rear seat - everything must come out for the seat to fit into that hole!  An undocumented feature is the need to close the passenger vents to the front seat before the front window heater will receive any hot air.
    Every three thousand miles a message appears on the dashboard (maintenance required).  I have not found an owner usable method for disabling it (I don't pay dealer prices for maintenance).
     Be careful with your dealer.  Mine (Don Schunk in St. Louis) charges for a search for warranty problems.  As a result I have no dealer service for my Isuzu!
     The car has car cup holder all over, the seats are comfortable. My wife drives the car everywhere.
     Are we happy?  yes, but with dealer problems we would not repeat.
