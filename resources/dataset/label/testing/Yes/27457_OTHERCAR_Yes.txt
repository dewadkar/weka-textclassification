I purchased my 95 Dodge Neon Highline 4D in June of 94. At the time, I had not seen another one on the road. Within a year later, it seemed like everyone owned one.

It has been a very reliable car. Will get slightly better gas mileage using premium fuels. I've seen 42MPG on the highway. Average is probably closer to the high-30's. Maintenance costs have been low. A few recalls, but all have been minimal trouble.

It's a comfortable car for most driving conditions, but I believe the comfort level deteriorates on longer trips/commutes.

The audio system is great. Nice to have a factory stereo with the quality of aftermarket.

The performance of the Neon is well above what I expected when buying it. Lots of power and a relatively light car. Top speed is limited to 120MPH. Acceleration is impressive.

Aftermarket parts, performance parts, and accessories are abundant, to say the least. A Dodge/Plymouth Neon is very customizable.

When my Neon reached approximately 90,000 miles I began to develop clutch trouble and eventually the clutch locked up (unable to shift gears while engine was running). The pressure plate had a flaw and I replaced it along with the clutch and throw-out bearing. Ever since, it's just not quite been the same. It is however, still going.
