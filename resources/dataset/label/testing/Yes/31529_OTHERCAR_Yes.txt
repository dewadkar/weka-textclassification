              Coming from having an '88 Chevy to a brand new car, anything could be an improvement, however, leasing a Sentra SE was a great decision.  What it lacks in size, it makes up for in style, speed, and appearance.
  The SE model comes with just about every gadget one could want (the sunroof being the only option not included that I can think of).  It includes the upgraded 2.0L motor, ABS Braking System all the way around, attractive graphite-tinted gauges, 6-speaker stereo w/ CD player, security system including vehicle immobilizer system (which requires that the key have an embedded chip to start the car), midnight interior pattern, and more.
  The 2000 Sentra also has been re-designed from previous years, resulting in a much more stylish, eye-catching car.    
  On the down side, with a car load of friends, pickup becomes bogged down.  Also, at nearly 6' tall, the front seat leg room is barely adequate (I have to take my shoes off for long drives), and with the front seats all the way back, rear leg room is nill.  Unfortunately, having it for only about 1/2 a year, I can't report on mechanical whether or not it's reliable mechanically.  So far, so good.
  Overall, I am very happy with my Sentra and would undoubtedly recommend it to anyone looking for a car of its class.
