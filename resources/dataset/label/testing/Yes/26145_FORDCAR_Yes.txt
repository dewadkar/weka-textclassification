            I bought this vehicle because i liked the appearance of it when i first saw it. I love the way it handles and it is quick on accelleration,also i love the soft seats and the great stereo system.The only thing the ranger could improve on is the gas mileage. this truck has a stiff suspension so it rides kind of rough over bumps,but just going down the highway it rides
nice and smooth couldn't ask for a better riding ford ranger truck. this model of truck is good for young people mainly,but is very easy to handle for just about anyone is wants to buy one.<br><br>
