            After driving several suburbans for more than twenty years, we switched to the Saturn SL.  Safety has always been our first concern.  Comfort is something that we also feel is very important.  Driving a Saturn is a very safe ride.  The steel beam doors, covered in durable plastic is very assuring.  The car is also very affordable.  Any young family starting out should consider a Saturn.  Our college daughters drive our Saturns, yes Saturns; we bought a second one, we like them that much.  A good hint to anyone going for a used car;  buy a Saturn from a Chrysler lot, they don't like having Saturns on their lot and you can get a really good deal.<br><br>
