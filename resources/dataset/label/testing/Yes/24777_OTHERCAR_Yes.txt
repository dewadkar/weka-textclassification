            I bought this camera primarily because of its weatherproof feature. I do a lot of cycling and it's good to know I can just throw the camera in my jersey pocket and not worry about sweat or rain damaging it. It's also very small which makes it a great choice for this purpose. 

The picture quality is outstanding. The camera gives you many choices for resolution and quality for your images, and you can take any combination you wish. This is a 3.2 megapixel camera so it will run up to 2048x1536 in its highest quality mode. I bought a 256MB picture card to go with this and it will take over 1500 pictures at 640x480 resolution. Over 100 at the highest setting.

This camera is packed with cool features. It has the same settings available as you would find on an automatic analog SLR camera, including Portrait, Night Scene, Macro, and a couple of others. 

This camera also supports up to 10-frame panoramas! What you do is take 10 pictures and line up the edge of each in the box that the camera shows you in the LCD display. Then, you use the Stylus software to automagically line up the edges. It's an incredible feature that really took some engineering to get right. I've seen this in no other camera.

The camera will take motion clips up to 70 seconds long in low-res mode. There's no limit to the number of these clips you can take, but no one clip can be more than 70 seconds long. This is a real pain, but I guess there are reasons to have this limit, what with movie copying and such. 

This camera feels really solid - like you're holding something substantial in your hand - yet it's very small. I love this well-made feel. 

Overall - GREAT CAMERA!
