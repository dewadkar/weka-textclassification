            My husband and I bought this van because we have a rather large family. When all of our kids are here we have 5 children and the 2 of us! This van fits us all. I really like it for many different reasons. It is good on gas, it rides very smooth, it has plenty of power, and the 4 doors are just wonderful. Easy to get in and out of. Mine is the shorter version which is to compact for my family! I need the extended version. But this a very reliable van!
  
I do find that the seats are not comfortable. I would suggest that the 2 front seats be captains chairs. We travel long distances often and have found that these seats are not the most comfortable. I have found also that the electronic sliding door on the passenger side gets stuck easily, but it has only happened 3 times so far in the year that we have had it. This is a very economical van. It has a digital compass on the inside. I would suggest it to anyone who has a family(smaller than 5 kids of course).The interior color of my van is light tan, but i like the gray better. 

The price range is a little high, but well worth it. I have noticed a few things on it and that is the service engine light comes on at 60,000 miles, and the ABS light is on also, but am having that checked out. I am curious to see how far this van will go on mileage and how well it will hold up. Our next van will also be a Venture! I would definitely recommend this van over most other minivans. We have driven several different ones, but this one is by far the ultimate.   <br><br>
