            In today�s ever-changing digital camera landscape the <B>Olympus C-2100 Ultra Zoom</B> is becoming a shrinking violet. Once in the forefront, and retailing in the thousand-dollar stratosphere, the C-2100 has been surpassed by an array of cameras with higher megapixel power than the Ultra Zoom�s once cutting edge, now modest but adequate 2.1 megapixel format. Yet, were I to buy a camera today, I�d still choose the C-2100, a camera not readily available now at many photo stores. In my local area Circuit City was the only business carrying it in stock.<P>

Before proceeding let me preface this review with a little background information.  Despite taking pictures for more years than I care to admit, I still consider myself a point and shoot amateur with a capital A. 
<p>
Although this wonderful camera has an astounding array of features, I mostly confine myself to the fully automatic mode. Occasionally I�ll experiment with the manual settings, but it�s hit or miss since I'm inexperienced with the advanced features.  Also it should be pointed out that I am very particular and second-guess almost every purchase, always irrationally looking for a missed bargain or something better. Happily I�ve never once regretted my decision to buy the <B>Olympus C- 2100</B>.

<B>WHATCHA GET IN THE BOX</B>

<P>
-	the one and a half pound digital camera  measuring    4   7/16� x 3 1/16� x 5 9/16�<p>
-	a nice camera strap<p>
-	an A/V cable used to view your pics on the <p>
television or record on video tape<p>

-	a USB cable to connect to your computer<p>

-	a remote control device  (the odds of my ever using this thing are remote)<p>

-	an easy to clip on lens cap<p>

-	warranty and registration cards<p>

-	three 200 page instruction guides in English, French and Spanish, plus a quick start guide<p>

-	instructions for the remote control<p>

-	a software CD containing the Camedia program, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, and Adobe Activeshare<p>

-	a battery charger and four AA NIMH batteries<p>

-	an 8 MB Smart Media card which is pathetically insufficient. I replaced it with a 32 MB card and then a 128 MB behemoth.<p>


<B>FEATURES</B>

Again there are so many that I may miss a few here. Being a simple Spudman, I don�t understand or use many of them anyway.

-	�2.1 mega pixel zoom that delivers high picture quality. It�s more than adequate for my purposes having printed some photos as posters with good results. 5� x 7� �s  look great.
-	Various exposure modes for advanced shooting. (manual aperture, manual speed,  portrait/sports/landscape/night scene modes, black and white, and sepia) I�ve taken fabulous night shots with this camera in low light conditions that I never thought were possible.
-	Multi-metering
-	Sequential shooting at high shutter speeds
-	Movie function that lets you record short movies with sound. Individual frames from the movie can then be printed as still pictures.
-	Electric viewfinder that enables information display in the Record mode. I prefer to view this information on the monitor on the back of the camera.
-	Simultaneous recording of sound with movies or still pictures
-	Wide-angle TFT LCD monitor
-	Removable Smart Media card with Panorama function
-	A close up mode
-	Self-timer and built in flash
-	Tripod socket
-	A/V out jack for viewing pictures on a television
-	10x optical zoom lens with a stabilizer function plus 2.7 X Digital Zoom to make possible photographs equivalent to a 27X zoom. This is the primary reason I bought this model. Try finding a camera with this powerful a lens in any price range. The successor to the Olympus C- 2100 is more expensive and lacks the stabilizer function (a necessity for all but those with steady hands or a tripod) and the 10 X lens.
<P>

If you are in the market for a digital camera, consider the <B>Olympus C-2100</B>. Its combination of features and powerful zoom lens warrants a look. Don�t let the 2.1 megapixels deter you. New models will soon surpass any camera you buy today with more gadgetry and higher pixel stats.
Keep several sets of rechargeable batteries on hand, buy a higher capacity Smart Media card, and consider buying an AC adaptor to save batteries. I often forget to turn the camera off which could mean a sure death for the batteries. Luckily the camera turns itself off after a few minutes.
<P>
This being my first digital camera, I appreciate being able to take as many pictures as I want of a single subject to get that one good shot. With this camera you can try different speeds, exposures and formats. I took some pics of my new Mr. Potato Head sprinkler the other day and was able to freeze drops of water in midair. During that session I took pictures in the sepia and black and white modes. This seems to be a useless feature because the same effects can be achieved with software. All in all I am crazy about this camera and still crazy about potatoes.
