            Certain things ought to be taught at whatever school automotive designers attend...things like equality and cup holders for all.  We enjoy our '94 Mercury Villager...enough to have put on 40,000 miles in less than two years.  We bought it and left three days later for a road trip.  By the time we returned, we were enamored with it's handling and economy (24 mpg hwy, loaded to the gills with kids and stuff), and puzzled by it's quirks (front and third row occupants get cup holders and speakers...middle occupants get none.)  
Another quirk is the second-row radio and heat controls that beg our children to A) annoyingly skip from one cd track to the next and B) alternately cook and freeze their unfortunately third row seated sibling.
Power is less than adequate (granted, I'm a hot rodder at heart), but on-center feel and cornering grip is wonderful.  Sixteen inch wheels stay squarely planted at all times.  In 40,000 aggressive miles I've only engaged the ABS on dry pavement twice.  
We would buy another Villager, provided that they've found a way to inject the V6 with a little more zoom in the last six years.<br><br>
