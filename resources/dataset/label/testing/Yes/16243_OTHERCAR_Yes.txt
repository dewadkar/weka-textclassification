            Prices of new cars really can be a downer when searching for a new car.. But once you step on the lot of a Toyota dealer your pleasantly surprised. The options you use to pay extra for are part of the package, air conditioning, am/fm cassette radio.  There are many choices of colors.. If they don't have it in stock they order it for you. As for us we ordered teal blue.. It took 3 weeks to come in but was well worth the wait. The choice of seat color is very limited to only 2.  I wouldn't of chosen gray or sandstone if there had been more choices.. I am a short person so the headrest come up a little to high making visibility a little less than I would like. Therefore I removed the back headrest. But opted to keep the front intact. I like that the seatbelt is adjustable so that it doesn't ride high on your neck. 
 The only two problems that I have with the car is that in the summer when you start the car it stinks for about 10 minutes from the mildew smell coming from the vents.. In the winter when the choke kicks off it lunges forward a little even with the foot on the brake. 
 We have taken it on road trips and it has faired very well only a flat tire which wasn't covered since it doesn't come with a road hazard warranty. So we had to buy a new tire. The steering wheel is rather hard and uncomfortable during long drives. We bought a steering wheel cover and it has helped tremendously. The seats are very comfortable and the ride is quiet. The touchy steering didn't take long to get use to. It makes very sharp turns which is good if you need to make U turns. The front seats go back pretty far leaving very little room for passengers. Not a good thing if your car is for all adults.  
 The price is a definite plus. A nice size car, cloth seats, floor mats, am/fm cassette, automatic  transmission all for under $14,000. Well worth the price.<br><br>
