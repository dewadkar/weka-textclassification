            The 2000 Kia Sportage is a real gem of a SUV.Its really great on gas about 450 kilo to a full tank /combined city and highway driving.My old car finally had to be replaced and I always wanted a SUV.The Lease price was good so I went for It! Yes I have had a lot of brake dust,but so far no electrical problems with mine.
Its a very nimble vehicle,responsive to the accelerator for a relatively small engine.Mine is a standard shift and it has a very very easy synco-shift unlike some others I tried.
There are some negative features with this vehicle.(1)The rear window wiper switch is impossible to see while driving as it is hidden from the driver in the normal driving mode.(2) It really needs another faster windshield wiper speed as the rain does not clear fast enough at the wipers top speed.(3)Don,t let the power window switches get wet as this will cause problems with corrosion. (4)The radio is a real lemon.I have had to have if replaced.Theres is a terrific wind wandering factor with this vehicle also.
