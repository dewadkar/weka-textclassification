            My folks bought a 1988 Honda accord lx-i when they first came out...year after year that baby purred. Recently, I sold my old car and had to use the folks honda for a few weeks until I found  car to buy. this thing had over 350,000 miles on it when I got it. And it started every morning, only reported problem was replacing the clutch, and you have to eventually do that in ANY stick shift car. By the time I had given the honda back to mom and dad and they sold it, it had over 400,000 miles on it. Well, that did it for me; I was a honda man for life. I ended up buying a 1997 Honda accord LX, 4 door. I was able to get it in 1999 for 14,900... not a great price, but I'd say a fair price.
This baby has treated me right. The only problem I've had so far (and so did my parents 88 model, and my best friends 96 model) is the power windows... they die early.
The one thing I like about Hondas that many Honda extreemests love too is the ability to increase your cars power... 
While the 4 cylnder power is alright, hondas are designed to be "souped" up. I've added a flowmaster muffler (loud, but added about 10 horse power) and a performance intake (added about 5 horse power) with more to come. But other than all that, the car standard is just fine. Be ready to keep it for a long time!
