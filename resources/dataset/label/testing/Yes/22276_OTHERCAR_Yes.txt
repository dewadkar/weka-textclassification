            I'm 28 years old.  I've been married to my husband for 5 years.  We used to cut out early from work on Fridays and go to Vegas for the weekend. We now have a mortgage and a 4 month old son.  I'm not sure when it happened, but somewhere along the way, it did.  We became grown-ups.  Though I swore it would never be me, it is...I own a minivan.  And honestly, I don't know how we managed without it for so long.

I own a black, 2 door, sporty coupe, (which is now my husband's car).  He used to drive a big, souped up SUV.  The kind with the performance tires, sports rack, tinted windows, and sharp paint job.  Then we had Zachary.  Ever tried to get a sleeping infant in and out of one of those big monster SUVs or a 2 door car?  Neither was an easy task.  So began our hunt for a &quot;practical&quot; vehicle.  The more we looked and researched, the more we leaned towards {gasp} minivans.  We narrowed our search down to three and after driving it, we decided on the sporty-looking 2000 Mazda MPV.  I can't believe it's me saying it, but the reality is, I love my minivan!  

The model we purchased was the base DX.  The DX comes with an automatic V-6 transmission, air conditioning, AM/FM/CD, tilt steering wheel, overdrive, two sliding center doors with functioning windows and a tumble-under third seat.  It is averaging 21 miles per gallon, much better than our SUV, which averaged 14.  

The third seat is a wonderful thing.  When up, it is a bench seat that will accommodate two adults.  I don't recommend going on a long trip with two adults in the third seat however as it is rather small and probably not comfortable for long periods of time.  This seat easily folds under to make a flat cargo surface.  It can easily be flipped up again and tipped backwards to make a comfy seating area for camping, tailgating, (or as we recently discovered, watching fireworks) when the rear hatch is open.  A great feature!  

The two center seats are also nicely designed.  The can be separate captains chairs or pushed together to make a short bench seat.  As captains chairs they are quite comfortable for adults even on long road trips.  They also provide a nice sized seating area for emergency feedings and/or diaper changes while travelling.  

The MPV is easy to get in and out of and with the third seat folded down it provides plenty of cargo space.  Something you need when toting around all the infant paraphernalia that accompanies each and every car trip.  Even with the third seat up we have stored a full-size stroller, an activity mat, diaper bag and a Pack N' Play behind it easily.  

This minivan is easy to maneuver and drives like a car.  I was expecting it to feel big and boxy, but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it handles.  On the freeway, there is wind noise, but it is tolerable and the cries of an infant drown out any outside noise you may notice. 

The driver's seat is very comfortable, with an armrest which can be flipped up if you so choose.  The gearshift is located on the steering column and does make it difficult to reach three of the buttons on the radio, but with time I am sure that this will become less bothersome.  Parking is somewhat difficult in crowded parking stalls due to the fact that you are unable to see the van's front edges from the driver's seat.  Another issue that will take some getting accustomed to.

Another great feature, which I believe is exclusive to the MPV, is that both side door windows roll down.  Not pop-out as on other models, but actually roll down.  The windows on either side of the third seat pop-out as well but it is nice to be able to put the windows down a bit to keep the it a bit cooler in the back during the warm summer days.  On either sliding door, there is a built in water bottle holder for a 1.5 L bottle of water in addition to several cup-holders placed throughout.  There is no center console in our model, but personally I prefer that so I can jump in the back with ease should I need to.  There is storage for CDs, tissues and change along with two adjustable cup-holders in the front beneath the stereo.  On the roof above between the driver and passenger is a storage area for a garage door opener and two pairs of sunglasses, along with a nice maplight.    

 However, there is one MAJOR negative that comes with this van.  It is difficult to find a child car-seat that will fit in the rear-facing position.  The infant carrier/car-seat we are currently using barely fits in the seat behind the driver.  We had to try several convertible car-seats in the van before we found one that fits, and that one fits best in the third seat.  I think that this minivan is designed for car-seatless people in mind.  

All in all a good minivan at a good price. <br><br>
