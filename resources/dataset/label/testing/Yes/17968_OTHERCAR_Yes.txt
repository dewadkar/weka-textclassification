            Jeep Wrangler is not a car to buy blindly. But if you like the way it feels, and I do, it is one of the best vehicles you will ever ride.

i came to this car late (mid 30s) and i wish i had bought this back when i was 22.  nevertheless, next to Alfa Romeo Veloce I had long ago, this car ranks as one of my best driving experiences.

pros:

-the jeep driving experience
-reliability
-open air experience
-4-wheel drive
-simplicity


cons:

-rough ride especially for the passenger
-manual transmission
-cramped back seat


If you buy a wrangler, do make sure that you get 6-cyl (power is needed) and AC.  Also get full doors if you can, it is worth extra money.
