            <b>Picture Quality</b>
<br>
    Though the picture quality of this camera is no where near professional quality, it is very good for a 2 megapixel digital camera. In comparison to the digital cameras belonging to friends of mine, this one would always produce crisper images. I'd also like to point out that the flash on this camera is <b>very bright</b> and will allow for colored, detailed pictures in any lighting conditions.
<br>
<b>Movie Mode</b>
<br>
    The movie mode is one of the weakest aspects of this camera. There are several different resolution shcemes to choose from, but none are very high. It will, however, record limitless movie (until the memory stick runs out of course). The movies all look very dark, and nearly impossible to see in bad lighting conditions. Another huge drawback is the lack of audio.
<br>
<b>Zoom</b>
<br>
    Another drawback of this camera is the digital zoom. An unzoomed image from this camera can end up looking excellent, compared to a fully zoomed image that degrades to more webcam quality. I have found that it turns out a lot better if you do not use the zoom, then enlarge the image later in the computer (Photoshop does a very good job of this).
<br>
<b>Durability</b>
    I've found my camera very durable in the months that I've been using it. I live in Northern Michigan, and have used the camera in the dead of winter (in as low as -15) and it still worked well. The only problem I can tell with cold is that the LCD screen gets a little laggy, but is easily dealt with and doesnt effect images or movies. I couldn't tell you if the camera stands up to impact well, simply because, I've never dropped it.
