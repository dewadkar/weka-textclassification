            A while back I was "window shopping" through car lot row in my town and decided, even though I wasn't in the market for a new car at the time, to get a "free trade in appraisal".

Next thing I knew, I was looking at the SUV's and drooling.
<p>
The appraiser was out so I came back the next day after doing some research.

I was drooling over the Chevy TRAILBLAZER that they had but it was WAAAAAAY out of my price range for the one I wanted.

In my wanderings about the lot I found my beauty hidden away in a corner of the lot.

There she was, shimmering and silver in the cold blustery weather, a sad lonely look in her headlights as if she was saying <i>"PLEASE take me for a test drive?"</i>
<p>
I took her out with the salesman and fell in love with the way she handled and purred for me.

<p>
<i>Now that the fantasy set up is over...</i>

<b>Features that I like(d)</b>
1. LOTS of space for head and legs and storage/hauling.
   <i>Being 6'4" tall with the standard build of a gorilla-teddy bear love child. Head and leg room are important commodities for me.</i>
2. Power mirrors, windows and door locks controlled from the driver's side.
3. Fast, smooth responses to gas, breaks, and turns.
4. Comfortable front bucket seats with great lumbar support.
5. Four wheel drive changes with the simple shift inside the cab with no mucking about in the mud and snow to lock in hubs.
6. Back seat folds down allowing extra hauling room.
7. 4.0L V-6 engine has plenty of get up and go.

<b>Things I don't care for so much</b>
     <i>DISCLAIMER: Keep in mind that the VOLVO that I
        had before this may have me a bit spoiled.</i>
<p>
1. Not the most fuel efficient in town. (I get about 300
 miles to the tank so far and have not had a chance to go 
 on a major road trip YET.)
2. There is a good bit of sway in turns since it sits high and is a bit top heavy.
*3. the ride is okay, a bit rough but not too bad. 
(see the disclaimer above)
4. Gear ratio seems a bit off.  It may just be all of the sand on the roads from the sand and saltings this winter but I find myself spinning out often on takeoffs without meaning to.
5. There's a LOT of vehicle to navigate if you are used to a smaller vehicle. (40 acres of hood)
6. A little road noise gets in but not too bad with windows closed.
<p>
<b>Good uses</b>
1. family trips with the whole gang. (Can seat 5 comfortably, 6 or 7 if the other 2 don't mind sitting in the cargo area behind the back seat, sideways.
2. off roading. (If you don't mind messing up the pretty paint job or can afford to have it re-done.
3. Point A to B in bad weather a little safer. (Remember, 4 wheel drive just means on ice all 4 wheels spin)
4. Home improvement projects (hauling stuff to and away from the place)
5. Four little words.  "Yard Sales and AUCTIONS"
6. Designated driver for the office, fill the seats then pour the rest into the cargo area or strap them to the luggage rack on the roof.
7. Car pool.
8. Two little words "ROOOOOAD TRIIIIIP!!
<p>
<b>Features that came with my Jeep</b>
AM/FM/Cassette/single CD player (great speaker system and
 basic equalizer)
Central locking system with keyless entry
antilock breaks
Reclining front seats
cloth and carpeted interior
anti-theft system (cut off switch and horn alarm)
tinted glass
Air conditioning
Cruise control
Driver and passenger side air bags
Heated outside mirrors
trip odometer
rear glass wiper/washer, defroster

So far I'm still in love with this car.  it's not my Volvo but then again, it's more practical for my needs.
