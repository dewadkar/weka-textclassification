            When I went looking for a new car last year, I knew what I wanted.  Power, Handling, Good Looks, Room for four, and Reliability.  I figured that I'd have to compromise in one of those areas to get the rest and boy was I wrong.

My 328i has been bulletproof reliability-wise, handles almost perfectly(more on this later), has great power (what an engine!), is refined, and is plenty big enough for four average people.  It's a blast to drive and practical, too.  After 25000 miles I still smile every time I start it up.  It even did a good job in the snow with all-season tires and a great job with snow tires.

I could keep gushing, but the point is to provide a balanced opinion, so here are some points where the 328i IS a compromise:

- The trunk is small
- Standard suspension is a bit soft for me.  Test drive with both the standard and sports suspensions before buying.
- Back seat is tight for my taller friends.

Overall, a perfect car for me.  Of course, I LOVE to drive and am willing to pay for it, and I have access to a mini-van for those Home Depot trips.<br><br>
