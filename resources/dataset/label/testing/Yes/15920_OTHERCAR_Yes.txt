            My family recently got a Mercury Sable- year 2000 model. A lot of luxury for a low price. The v6 has plenty of power. The power sunroof works very smoothly and has a variety of positions. All of the added perks are great-climate control,outside temp,6 cd changer in the trunk. The front seat is comfortable and the adjusting foot pedals are wonderful. The back seat is very roomy-comfortable for three and has plenty of leg room .My only complaints are that there is an incredible amount of glare from the windshield and it is necessary to get a &quot;dashmat&quot; to cut the glare. Another problem is the shape of the trunk opening-it is narrow compared to the interior. The back seats fold down to allow long items but it is awkward to put them into the trunk. Very comfortable to drive but a small steering wheel. Overall very happy with this car.<br><br>
