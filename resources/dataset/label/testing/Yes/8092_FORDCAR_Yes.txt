            I purchased my Explorer off the floor in 1998.  I was driving a Ford Windstar (due to children) and decided now that the child car seats were no longer needed...and the convenience of the sliding door..I wanted to upgrade to a truck.  

There are so many things I love about my truck.  It has a good ride...although much different from a Van.  You do feel the little bumps in the road.  I love the traction in the winter....as well as the handling.  It goes into 4 wheel drive automatically.  Although there's only seating for 5 the space I gained in the back was worth it.  It's very comfortable to drive...although smaller inside.  The radio.....heat....a/c...all very identical to the Windstar.  There isn't anything I don't like about it.....except the rear windshield wiper &quot;locks&quot; when you shut it down....which means if I'm driving and it begins to rain...I do have to get out to unlock it.  I do like the &quot;sportiness&quot; of the truck.  It tends to be louder and seems faster than a Van.  

Who should buy the vehicle?  Well, if you have a lot of kids with car seats I don't suggest it.  But if you want to go from a Van to a truck I highly recommend this one.  The look, the feel, the power behind the Explorer is well worth looking into.<br><br>
