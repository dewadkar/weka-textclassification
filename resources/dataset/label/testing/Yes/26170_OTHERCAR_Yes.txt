            In reading the other opinions posted here I get the distinct impression that the nay-sayers are probably not very mechanically adept.  Do you have to perform routine maintenance and replace parts due to normal wear and tear?  Absolutely!  But to state that the Mark VII is "Expensive" to own is untrue, unless you're the kind of person that doesn't even do your own minor repair work.

I just purchased a classic example of that.  It's a '90 LCE w/ 92,000 miles that I bought for $2,000.00.  The car had been sitting for a year, had a puddle of transmission fluid under it, started right up but wouldn't idle (surged, died, etc), shuddered BADLY when stopping and both front fenders were literally sitting on the tires.  I replaced the transmission pan gasket for under $15.00 (that fixed the transmission fluid leak), replaced the TPS (throttle position sensor)for about $25.00 and cleaned the air intake venturi with a can of spray cleaner (about $3.00), turned the front rotors (another $10.00) and installed new front air bags (about $200.00 worth of parts, including shipping and less than 2 hrs of labor).  Now I'd drive it anywhere.  The only specialized tool required to change the front air bags is a standard flat blade screw driver.  It's actually easier than changing a starter.  The Ford dealerships don't tell you that, do they?

This is my second Mark VII and I LOVE IT.  It's going to become a unique street rod (conversion to a 5-speed manual transmission and a supercharger)
