              I received my camera as a xmas present. First of all the price is very attractive. This camera produced wonderful quality pictures for the value. I believe that this is a perfect family and special occasion camera. Also the software that comes with the camera is very user friendly. I think a grammar school student could figure it out. 
  One of the problems I have experienced with the camera is that you can get very few pictures on the high quality setting. Another problem is that all of the buttons make it very confusing. Just getting a display on the screen can take about 5 minutes, definately not a good thing if you are in a hurry to catch that perfect photo opportunity. 
  My far biggest complaint is probably one shared by many digital camera users, but seems to be over exagerated with this model, and that is battery life. This camera runs on 4AA batteries and lasted me exactly 34 pictures, then it was dead. I mean if I could afford to buy all these batteries I would have not got a digital camera to save money from developing costs.
