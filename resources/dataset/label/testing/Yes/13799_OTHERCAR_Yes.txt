            After shopping for a new car, I've decided to stick with my Tercel.  Gas mileage used to be more of an issue that it seems to be today.  If you're like me, you don't like to stop for gas.  We enjoy spending time in the Rockys, and that's one place where you really need good gas mileage and a reliable car.  My Tercel provides both.  

After recovering from sticker shock when I thought I wanted to buy a new SUV, the miles per gallon information seemed like a joke!  No, an SUV isn't for me.  I've been spoiled.

If you're considering buying a new or used car, check out the Toyota Tercel if you like driving better than stopping for gas.  They're great cars!<br><br>
