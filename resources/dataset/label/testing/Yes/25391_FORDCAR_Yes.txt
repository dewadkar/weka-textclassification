            Before I begin to praise my 1994 Taurus, I should confess that I am a Ford driver. Not only that, but I come from a long line of Ford drivers. We are a dedicated, dyed-in-the-wool Ford family. We are working on a place in the garage to house a 1927 Model T Ford next to my wonderful Taurus. The T has had no other owners than my ancestors. My grandfather bought it new. His father liked it, and granddad gave it to great-granddad. When great-granddad felt he was no longer a safe driver, he gave it to my mom. See what I mean about being a Ford family?

Anyway, on to the 1994 Taurus. I bought my Taurus as a program car. For those unfamiliar with the concept, a program car is one that has been owned before usually as a lease car or executive company car, driven for a year or so and totally reworked before being sold to a new owner. The program car goes back to the factory for a complete check before being sold again. It has a great warranty feature, and is almost lemon proof. You get a decked out, newly revamped car for a used car price.

My Taurus had 21,000 miles on it when I bought it. We are now at 179,000 and change. There is now a small hole in the floor mat where my heel rests as the cruise control takes me cross country. The owner manual said that oil changes were only necessary under hard driving conditions every 3,500 to 4,000 miles. I change mine at 3,750 and have never had any trouble with it. I love my Taurus, because it gives me a safe, reliable ride and looks good going down the road.

The trunk is huge. My family packs two sets of outfits for every road trip, and there is always room for souvenirs and a cooler. The cabin is big enough that everyone in the front and back seats can ride comfortably all day. My three adult family drives from central Kansas down to Galveston in a two day drive about every other year. The Taurus makes the trip more pleasant.

My brother has driven a 1994 Probe. My family has driven a 1970 something Ford LTD, a Fairmont wagon of the same vintage, and a one ton Ford truck on the farm. We are familiar with the service and quality of a Ford product and can confidently recommend them to anyone. My #1 favorite though is my 1994 Taurus. Sometime in the next five years or so, my Taurus will probably quit running. Then and only then will I replace it. You guessed it, with another Ford. This time I think I'll go for a minivan, or maybe a Crown Victoria. This possibilities are delightful.

I suddenly have the urge to go for a long drive. Bye!<br><br>
