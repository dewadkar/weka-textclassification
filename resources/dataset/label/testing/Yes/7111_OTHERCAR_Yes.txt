            I purchased a 1999 MX-5 Miata in the summer of 1998, when the new style first came out.  I loved the new look of the car, it looks a lot like the last generation RX7.  I got a top of the line one, black with tan leather interior.  The car is very sharp, and elicits looks everywhere I go.  Mine has the Bose stereo, and it is very good.  You can cruise at 70 mph with the top down and still hear the music clearly!  The 5-speed transmission is by far the most racecar-like transmission I have ever felt.  It has an extremely short throw, and you can really slam the gears easily when you're out having fun.  The car redlines at 7200 rpm, and has a rev limiter to keep you from overdoing it.  The engine is virtually bullet-proof.  The ride is stiff, as you would expect, but not uncomfortable.  I've heard that the sport package is quite a bit stiffer.  The convertible top is excellent, and you can open and close it while sitting in the drivers seat.  That would be unheard of on any other convertible that I know of.  The car is small, and drivers over 6' may not like it.  The handling and braking are excellent and you really feel like you're in control of this car.  The only complaint that I have is that it is seriously underpowered.  It only took about 2 days of owning it and I was searching the internet for aftermarket turbos and superchargers to get more power.  I never got one, but I wish every day that I would have.  It will never be a true sports car until Mazda puts a beefier motor in the car.  Compared to the new Honda S2000's 240 horses, the Miata's 140 is pretty anemic!  But it is truly a blast to drive, so if the power is not that important to you, by all means get the car and you'll love it.<br><br>
