It is well documented the reliability and quality of Toyota. The 2004 Camry LE is certain to uphold or surpass this reputation. 
CONVENIENCE: armrest/CD-holder, power windows/mirrors, digital outdoor temperature gauge, floorboard footrest, sunglasses holder in roof, good interior lighting; cruise control, grocery-bag hooks & liter bottle holders in trunk; electronic key to lock/unlock driver door and trunk, and it has a panic button you can push if you can't find your car in a parking lot. It also has a valet key you can put in your purse/wallet in case you lock yourself out.  When you have half a gallon of gas left in the tank a light on the instrument panel informs you of this.  The doors automatically lock when you put the car into gear. Daylight Running Lamps (DRL) can be turned on or off as desired. The odometer can be set to check the distance for 2 separate trips. Stereo comes with a CD-player. The speakers are pretty average. 
COMFORT: When the solid doors close with a quiet but reassuring "whoompf" you feel like you are sealed into a spaceship. The seats are plump and cushy, sturdy and comfortable. Instrument panel is clear and logical, albeit centrally located so you'll have to reach a little. The driver's seat has 3 levers/switches that can electronically adjust to any body type. The steering wheel can be raised or lowered about 6 inches as well. On the road, the engine is quiet and outside noise is muffled, especially those noisy 18-wheelers. The heating/air conditioning works fast and are easily adjustable by knobs instead of levers which become "sticky" from dust over the years.  Be sure you watch the speedometer! Acceleration is swift and before you know it you're cruising along at 85 mph, yet it feels like you're going only 50. I use the cruise control to set the speed lest the DMV Nazis slap me a ticket. 
QUALITY: The car has an overall solid feel to it. The attention to all the little details lets one know that Toyota has been listening to its customers while perfecting a good design.  At the dealership I declined the extended warranty. I felt that because of the high quality of Toyota  a standard warranty would be sufficient. This saved me thousands of dollars in the long-term.  Some other car manufacturers whom I will not name could profit greatly by observing Toyota.   
THE BAD: There are few negatives to report, but there are some. This car is bigger and heavier than average, and it appears to have a weak braking system.  You can't "stop on a dime" with this car. I guess I'm used to lightly tapping the brake and stopping instantly.  The brake on the Camry is "mushy" --you push it down a little and you slow down a little. I think the ABS option would negate this. Another negative is that the power steering is a little stiff, meaning, you can't drive it with your pinky. Perhaps I am just used to looser steering. The final negative is the high & centrally positioned radio, as well as having the radio station display, clock, and outside temperature gauge close together. You have to take your eyes off the road a little too long to check these, but I assume with more driving it won't be an issue. I suggest not messing with the radio too much while driving  because you have to look away from the road too far. 
Overall I am well-pleased with this car.
