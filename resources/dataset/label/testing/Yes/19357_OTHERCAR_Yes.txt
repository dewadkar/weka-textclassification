            I have owned this car for six months and have previously owned two Sentras (a '92 and a '96), which are the same exact car in four-door trim, each of which went 150,000 miles without so much as a hiccup.  All we ever changed were oil, tires, and one set of brakes.  My wife also owned a '96 Sentra for several years before we were married and the only problem she ever had with it was a warn-out alternator at around 75,000 miles.  Mine have all been 5-speeds, so I don't know how the automatic holds up.  I've never replaced a clutch, though the first two cars could have each used a new one at 125k but I decided to just ride it out and let the next guy deal with it.  The one I own now is at 90,000 miles and could probably use a new clutch within the next year or so.  I overpaid for mine at a dealer...check the classifieds or online and you'll do much better.

The positive aspects of this car are that it runs forever and is excellent on gas.  Like I said, mine is over six years old with almost 90k miles on it and it still gets almost 40mpg.  I can go 400 miles on a 10.5 gallon tank of 87 octane gas on the highway.  Around town, I get about 30-32mpg...about 325 miles/tank.  I have never had a single mechanical problem with any of the three I have owned.  Even parts like brakes, shocks, and tires have lasted literally years longer than I would have expected.  There is a small patch of rust beginning to form inside the door sill on the passenger side, but other that that, the body is in fine shape, even the paint.  The weatherstripping around the driver's door is beginning to pull off in one place, but the car IS six years old, so I guess that's to be expected.  One of the windows jiggles a little as it rolls down, but that's the extent of any sort of electrical problems.

Mine is an SE, so it has power windows, locks, and mirrors, a power sunroof, and alloy wheels.  No CD player, but that's easy enough to add yourself if you want it.  The stereo is adequate at best, but that's also easy to replace yourself pretty cheaply.  If you get the SE-R instead, you get a bigger (2-liter) motor, disc brakes in the back, bigger (read: "more expensive to replace") wheel/tires, and I think a CD player, too, but the gas mileage of course isn't as good.  If you're a DIY-er, you can put in a cold-air-intake and a 2" high-flow exhaust with a good header on the 1.6 and you'll end up with close to the same power as the 2-liter (around 140bhp), but even so, it's not like you're ever going to win any races with either one.

As far as ergonomics go, I'm about 5'10" 150lbs and I find the seats very comfortable and the controls and pedals well-placed.  Vision out the back and sides is very good.  Anybody much heavier might find the seats a little tight (they have a lot of lateral support), and anybody much taller would probably bang their head getting in and out.  Forget about sitting in back if you're over 5'.  The seats are all very firm and great for around town, but they can get uncomfortable after several hours on the highway.  You can hold a surprisingly large amount of stuff in the trunk for how big (small) the whole car is.  The car has air conditioning and two airbags.

The only thing I don't like about this car is that it is very weak.  In between all my Sentras, I recently drove a Maxima for two years and got spoiled.  I oftentimes turn off the A/C when I'm pulling out onto the highway.  Unfortunately, there's no way around this problem if I want to keep my 40 mpg, so it's just something I have to live with.  It feels marginally more powerful at low RPM than some other Japanese 4-cyl motors I've driven, so that I don't feel the need to pull out onto the highway in third gear at 6000 RPM like I would in a Civic.  Fourth gear at 4000 is fine.  Try it in fifth and you're going to get some angry SUV tailgaters (though that can be kind of fun, especially if they're trying to pass someone on the right).

Anyway, all in all, I love this little car.  Like I said, I've owned two of them before this one and have every intention of buying another one in a few years (hopefully a nice low-mileage '02 or '03 SE-R!).  My dad owned an old Sentra before I did, and my wife's family had two of them as well, and they all went *well* over 100,000 miles with the only real problem I know of being the alternator in my wife's '96.  Unless you get a lemon, which I guess does happen sometimes, these things just run forever.  Find a used one that you know the history of and you'll be fine.  I bought this one five years old with 80,000 miles on it and fully expect to drive it myself for years and then give it to my sister to be her college beater.  It's a better car than something Korean or American in the same class, and you can usually find one for a thousand bucks or so less than a comparable Civic or Corolla, and I've found it to be just as good of a car.
