            I bought my 1992 240sx fastback last summer and it has been running strong ever since.  Mechanically speaking, I love the car!  The manual transmission is a dream, the cltuch feels just right, and the engine is powerful enough to where you can pass in 5th gear on the freeway.  Styling is something I'm not too thrilled about.  The interior is kind of cheap looking and the fabric on the seats flat out cheap looking! The dash and console make up for these cons.  The exterior is nothing to rave about.  The car looks 1993 RX7ish from the front due to the turn signal shape.  The rear profile is also pretty nice; looks very clean and simple.  The side vide is what I don't like at all.  It looks much too 1980's and the ride height is kind of too high.  The automatic seatbelts are a blessing to some and a curse to others.  Personally, I don't care for them too much because it's really annoying to have that belt move everytime I start the car or open the door.  The backseat is a joke...even small children would be unhappy.    <br><br>
