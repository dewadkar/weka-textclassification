            I bought a 1999 grey tone saturn about a year ago.  I bought this Saturn car because i knew someone who owned a 1994 saturn and it has been the most reliable vehicle they have ever had.  I agree with them.  I have had this car for over a year and it has run great!  I get close to 38 miles to the gallon, and it handles great.  The only thing i don't like about this vehicle is probably the engine size, but for someone who loves trucks, this is probably the only car i will ever buy.  I think young professionals should buy this car, and also college students, or recent graduates.  If you want a reliable car that will last a good ten to twelve years, then this is the car for you.  The company is probably the best company out there that makes cars in terms of customer satisfaction.  I highly recommend any Saturn product!<br><br>
