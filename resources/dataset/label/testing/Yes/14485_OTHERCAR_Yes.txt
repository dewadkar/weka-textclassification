            True story....my 1999 Grey Sonata parked in a parking lot next to a late model Lexus of the same color.  Both owners walk to the wrong car as we leave the store.  <i>The difference?</i>  About $25,000... and his has leather seats while mine has a cloth interior.  And guess what?  If you're looking for the best combination of class and value in America today - you've got to test drive a Hyundai Sonata.

  I know...you've heard about their quality problems of the past.  Well, the five year bumper to bumper warranty dispels any notion that this car might cause you problems.  Mine operates flawlessly and drives like a dream....and don't forget that it looks quite a bit like its much more expensive Japanese counterpart.  The steering is solid and engine is responsive, while at the same time getting a remarkable 27.5 miles per gallon.  I've been keeping track of my mileage religiously, and after almost 10,000 miles - it consistently averages over 27 mpg.

  It seats four adults very comfortably, and can handle two adults and three kids in the back as well without anyone feeling cramped.  The standard stereo system sounds fine...nothing fancy, but a good quality audio output.  I purchased mine new for just under $16,000 - including tax and title.  Automatic transmission and air are... of course, standard... as is that &quot;Best in America&quot; 5 year warranty.  Think about that...five years without one care or concern about anything (other than tires and wiper blades) being your financial responsibility.  Can you say...<i>&quot;what a deal!&quot;</i>  In fact I'll say it again....<i>loudly</i>: <b> I think it's the perfect car for a person who appreciates style and value in a classy combination.</b>

Any complaints?  Just one.  The defroster for the front and side windows works....but it does not keep the complete window clear when there are more than two people in the car.  It's the only thing I'd change if I was in charge of product design.
  
One more comment:  a good friend of mine recently bought a 1999 Honda Accord...we trade off going to lunch.  The cars are almost identical in terms of features, and in terms of feel and handling.  Only one difference, really.  His cost $8,000 <i>more</i> than mine.  And I smile at that thought every time I get into his vehicle.  And yes - I do rib him about it on occasion.  Wouldn't <i>you?</i>

  I would recommend a Sonata to anyone .... why spend more money than you have to when there are so many things right about this vehicle?     <br><br>
