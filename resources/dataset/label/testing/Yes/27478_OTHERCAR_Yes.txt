            The Pro70 is my first digital camera. Why did I buy it? The price was right at $600 Canadian. (I think that's about $400 US.)(?) I wanted to get my photos easily onto my computer for editing and printing. I spent several hours reading reviews on the Pro70 before committing myself to the purchase.  

Like many others, I experienced the immediate gratification of seeing my photos just minutes after taking them - no film and no developing. The Pro70 comes with a cable which can be attached to the video input of a TV or VCR and this allows the photographer to see photos on the "big screen."

What kind of photography is a digital NOT suited for? I'd have to say anything that moves, unless it's moving but not going anywhere, like the second hand on digital clock. I was trying to photograph my corgi dog walking in the bush and found it quite difficult to get a good shot. It's fortunate that if a shot is unacceptable it can be instantly deleted. I tried to picture myself taking a picture of a jumping fish on a lake and concluded that apart from extreme luck, it would next to impossible with a digital camera because of SHUTTER LAG. The picture is taken several seconds (APP.2.6 SECONDS) after the shutter button is pressed. 

When shooting pictures of people they must be alerted regarding shutter lag or they'll move too soon and ruin the photograph. A pre-arranged signal from the photogapher is essential to let them know when the photo has been taken. Subjects could easily confuse the auto focus flash for the moment the picture is taken, but it's not. Work out your own system when taking pictures of people.

The Pro70 has a selection of five different settings depending upon the image quality and size you want. Four of these are different size jpegs and the fifth is uncompressed, called CCD RAW. The file size of a photo in the RAW setting is 1,940kb compared to the largest finest jpeg which is around 360kb. This camera can take regular flash cards, but is also capable of handling the flash11 cards which opens up a new world of possibilities. 

The IBM microdrive can store over a gigabyte of information and fits the Pro70. (Many people seem to go for the 340meg capacity drive.)  The main reason I mentioned the microdrive, is that my experience with the Pro70 lead me to the conclusion that if I wanted to print a lot of 8"x10" prints then there is no beating the RAW setting as the other settings don't come close. Using a microdrive makes using the RAW mode far more available because of it's huge capacity allowing many RAW photos to be taken. Personally, I would not want a digital camera that could not handle an IBM Microdrive, unless the camera was just for email etc.

The Pro70 is only capable of 1.7MP which is a bit dated in my opinion when compared to new digital cameras on the market.I bought this camera because of the price and because it meets my needs. (I have to add that my preference would be for the Pro70 over other digitals with greater pixel capacilitiy but fewer features such as the flash11 capability and a superior lense.)

Some of the other features on the Pro70 are "Burst"mode which can take 4 shots in one second; an LCD viewer which should be used in macro mode. In macro mode the Pro70 is incredible, and takes very sharp images. When using AC, the hardware is supplied which saves the battery, especially when using the LCD. I appreciate that no extra expense is incurred for a charger. Sounds can also be recorded and assigned to a picture although I haven't figured out how to access the sound as when I open up a picture using a graphics program, there's no sound. I've also tried to acces the sound as a .wav file without any luck. The book is skimpy on info. on this and says, "Please refer to your computer hardware documentation." (I tried pasting a picture with a sound attached into a Word document, but still could not get the sound to come through after clicking on it. I'll get it yet.) I didn't buy a digital camera for sound though. Another feature of the Pro70 is the self timer which is easy to use and works very well.

Images can be transferred to a computer using the supplied interface cable, but it's slow.  A Card reader could be considered essential in my opinion. (My printer has one built in.)

The Menu is easy to use for altering settings or deleting files although pictures can be deleted without having to access the menu every time.

I purchased the Canon Speedlite 380EX flash as the Pro70 has no built-in flash. Just having a flash is not that great though as I have no way of using the flash off of the camera. I wish the flash synchronized at a higher speed, as the set 1/90 shutter speed is a bit slow sometimes. I need to spend more money on a hot shoe on an extension cord for the flash. One thing to consider is that nothing from your old 35mm works on a digital except maybe the tripod!

If you buy a Pro70 the next thing you must consider is your printer. Is your present printer capable of printing quality photos from a digital camera? You'll have to decide that one. As for battery life, this really depends more on the frequency and duration of use of the LCD viewer than on the number of pictures taken.

One reviewer doesn't have to say it all, so I hope the above gives epinion readers a little insight into the Pro70 from one owners viewpoint.
