            I picked up my Olympus D450 Zoom (1.3 Megapixel 1280x1024 resolution) off of shopping.yahoo.com for $440 plus $5 s/h on November 8, 1999.  Since then I've taken about 200 pictures with it, and I've got to say that I'm pretty impressed.  I was worried about the quality on a camera that was only 1.3 MPixels, but its hard for me to see the need for any higher resolution.  Prints on photo paper come out extremely close to what photographs look like up to 5x7.  BTW, if you're unsure about going digital because you still want the option of getting physical prints, consider some of the sites out there like shutterfly.com.  They'll mail you out high quality 5x7s for only 49 cents each, free s/h.  Back to the camera, the zoom lens is key to getting really good looking close ups.  I found myself using it about 75% of the time.
As great as I think this camera is, there are some areas that could be improved.  First, you're going to want to buy a new smartmedia card.  The one that comes with the camera will only hold 18 pictures.  Not enough for me.  I went with a 16MB card that could hold 36 pictures.  Another problem with this camera is its serial connection.  It takes sooo long to download images that I'll probably buy a USB adaptor soon.  Battery life isn't great, but adequate if you don't use the large LCD screen much.  Overall, I'd buy the same camera again.<br><br>
