            The Ford Contour is an excellent personal automobile. It's an ideal car for a single driver such as a college student, for a childless couple, or a couple with no more than one small child. It's not a family vehicle - nor does it claim to be. My Ford Contour is a company car, and I'm behind the wheel at least 2-4 hours per day. I enjoy driving it. It's comfortable, fun to drive, well made, and economical to operate. 

The Ford Contour compares very favorably with the Saturn or the Nissan Sentra, both of which I've driven. It's a nice car to drive as long as there are no more than 2 people in it. <br><br>
