            I bought my Volkswagen Beetle in October of 1998; it was the first year for the New Beetle.  I was trying to decide between a new Saturn and the New Beetle.  Needless to say the Beetle won me over.  I will admit that I was drawn mostly for the look of the car and the excitement of owning arguably the most popular car on the road.  But over the 14 months of ownership, I have realized what a great car I have.
First there is the pleasure of owning a Beetle.  When I first got my car, I couldn't go any where without people asking me how I liked it.  I had Mercedes passing me on the highway and the driver would be stretching to see my Beetle.  I was constantly washing my driver's side window because there were forehead prints from people peering into the interior while I wasn't around.  A small girl told me she wanted to buy my Beetle!  It was definitely a lot of fun.  But that has all died down now, so I can concentrate on the realistic qualities of car ownership.
First things first: the New Beetle has incredible handling.  It may only have a four cylinder engine, which is noticeable when trying to accelerate quickly, but it can handle the road as well as any car I have been in.  It has a low center of gravity, which helps it hug those curves, and the steering wheel feels like butter in your hands.  I have a manual transmission, which helps a bit on acceleration, but it also feels sportier.
There are the small things that help too.  Keyless entry is of course great. But I warn you, my trunk release still doesn't work all the time even after two times at the dealer.  I find the seats comfortable, however I have heard others complain, to each his own I suppose. The stereo system is great.
There are some drawbacks, but like the old Beetles, they are more quirks to me. The windshield is huge, which is great, but it is also a strange look for someone who is set in there ways (I told my mother not to buy it). The rear seat headroom is a little squished on the sides, but I have fit 3 adult men in the back seat, and they actually were impressed with the room!  Parallel parking can be difficult because you actually can't see the front of the car from your seat!  But you get used to it, and I always squeeze into the small spots on Chicago streets!
All in all, the Beetle is a very well built car, with German engineering, a fun yet sophisticated look, and very trivial drawbacks.  The 1999 model included a temperature gauge and a compass, which would be very helpful to me.<br><br>
