            Just got a brand new blue CR-V from carsdirect.com. Great price but horrible service from carsdirect. The car's a great little performer. Noise level inside it a little bit louder at high speed than it ought to be (you have to turn up the radio quite a bit) and the sound system could be better...but other than that, no complaints! The seats are nice and firm, it's surprisingly roomy for a small SUV, gas mileage is great, and of course, it's got Honda reliability. Price is reasonable, too.<br><br>
