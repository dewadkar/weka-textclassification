            I never thought you could get my mother into a sport utility.  She fought it for years.  But after riding in a friend's Cadillac Escalade, she began to rethink her original doubts.  This is a serious luxury vehicle.  While still a truck at the root, the people at the Cadillac plant have truly made this a Cadillac.  My concerns were the same as many; would this be another luxury sport utility where the company took the lower end model and dressed with the correct badgework.  For example, the Toyota Landcruiser became the Lexus LX450 (which now may be worthy but when they first came out were nothing more that a change of lettering.)
Such is not the case here.

First and foremost, the suspension is not a truck suspension.  It has an extremely soft ride and yet holds the road well in corners.  It has some lean, but that is minimal for a car of such size.  It almost has the &quot;surf&quot; effect at high speeds.  By that I mean it just flows with the road; no jarring bumps that rattle your teeth. 

The seats are nice enough to live in.  They have put captain's chairs in instead of the standard Yukon seats.  It makes a huge difference.  The seat warmers are a big plus for those cold mornings.  I love the wood on the steering wheel.  It kind of brings out a more luxurious feel. 

The stereo system is made by Bose and is top of the line.  It has great sound with plenty of volume up and down the whole range of frequencies.

The motor has more that enough juice and is quite quick.  The accelerator is a bit sensitive until you get used to it.  I found the brakes a bit grabby as well, however, that could just be me used to a different sport-utility.  It has a large towing capacity and can haul most trailers with ease.  My experience with towing has been limited with this vehicle, but I have had it loaded with luggage and people and it handles beautifully.  

The ONSTAR system is an incredible invention that few take advantage of.  I know that my mother doesn't.  It will make reservations for you and direct you to your location.  It will also let you in if you lock your keys in the car.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  I will say this.  If your check engine light comes on, you need only call Onstar and they can run a diagnostic from satellite on your car and tell you immediately what is wrong.  That's pretty cool.

The truck/car/limo is good for anyone who demands luxury with performance in a larger sport utility.  This is about as good as it gets.  Me personally, I like the styling of the Lincoln Navigator better.  But the seats are much harder and the ride not near as smooth.  Check my review on the Lincoln when you get a chance. 

This is a big truck; make no mistake.  But it is a super car and the Cadillac reputation for service and quality makes driving the car a pleasure.
