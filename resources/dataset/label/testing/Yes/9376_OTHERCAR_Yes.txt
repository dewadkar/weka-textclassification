            I bought this vehicle because of its outstanding reputation or being reliable and afordable. Its a nice car, with low fuel consumption.
Its ideal for students such as myself who travels 30miles back and fourth from home to college on daily bases..I would'nt call my Tercel a family car due to its limited space for back seat drivers. I have 70,000k on my car's odometer and its still going steady. For someone who is  looking for subcompact car with some high speed performance, I suggest that you should buy Tercel equiped with manual 5 speed transmission. Automatics transmission is nice but a little slow specially when it comes to speeding up.    <br><br>
