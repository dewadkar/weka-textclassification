            I have owned the Prizm for the last 6 months. Used prices are very good on this car. It is a Toyota Corolla, but the prices on these are much lower than a comparable Corolla.

Overall, the car is very well built and has a fuel efficient 1.6 L engine. Power is adequate and will serve well if you do not usually accelerate hard from a stop. Passing power is good once the torque converter locks up at about 40 MPH.

I have measured about 29 MPG in mixed driving which is a little less than I got from my Nissan Sentra 1.6L but then that was a manual shift, 5 spd. This is a 3 spd. auto.

My only complaint about this car is that the engine noise is excessive once you cross about 70 MPH. Below that engine noise is actually quite low.
