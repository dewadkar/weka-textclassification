             When I turned 16, my father wanted a car that he knew he could trust his baby driving, without being injured. We, together, looked up several different types of vehicles, and Saturn�s safety features and great price popped into the picture on several occasions. 
	So , the journey for the perfect car began. When I test drove my Saturn, I was in heaven. I was used to driving my dad�s Mercedes, so I expected the Saturn to drive a lot worse. I was wrong. It was smooth, and the steering was perfect.  It was very comfortable for me to sit in as well, and the controls were all easy to read and get to while driving.
	We bought my little Saturn, and I was content.  While I was in High School, the parking lot usually destroyed any car sitting in it. Not my Saturn. My car was hit several times, and did not dent the car. My brother and his friends used to hit it,  just like in the commercials, and sure enough, the dent resistant panels remained dent resistant. I lived 15 miles from my high school, meaning gas was a big problem. The gas mileage on my car was about 28 miles to the gallon. It saved a poor starving student a lot of money, and time. 
	The big test was an accident. I was driving along when a truck  broad sided me. When my friend and I got out to examine the damage, we were shocked. A few dents and a scratch. The door was jammed because he struck me at the joint, but all of us expected a lot worse.
	Now I�m in college and without a car. I miss my Saturn, and can�t wait to bring it with me next year! Now I can test it on the icy roads of Utah�
