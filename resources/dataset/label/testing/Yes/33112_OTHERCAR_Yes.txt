            It was a few days over one year ago when I first thrust myself upon Epinions, and looking back, my very first review was on a piece of garbage 1997 Ford Taurus that I had been driving.  It was a company-owned car, so I didn�t have any choices in what I could purchase, and I was very open and honest.  It was the biggest piece of garbage on the road.

A short time later, I was given another company-owned car, this time a 1999 Ford Taurus.  While it doesn�t have nearly as many problems as the 1997 model, it is far from trouble-free.  I went ahead and submitted a review on that vehicle as well.

This past week I was in Cincinnati on business and my company had me rent a vehicle at Avis.  I was sure they were going to stick me with yet another Taurus, since they have an allegedly superb safety record (although getting stranded in the middle of God�s country I suppose doesn�t qualify as a �safety� concern.).  I was wrong � it wasn�t a Taurus, it was a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu.

I don�t pay much attention to cars anymore.  When I was buying my own vehicles, I used to always keep a sharp eye out for attractive cars.  There are certain vehicles that still catch my eye.  For instance, I can tell you what a Viper or Corvette looks like.  I can identify a Porsche a mile away.  It�s pretty hard to miss those hideous Beetles.  I can�t say for sure if I�ve ever seen a Chevrolet Malibu since, say, the 1970s.

My first impression of this vehicle made me cringe.  It looked like a typical four-door four-banger American compact car.  There was nothing at all distinctive about it.  Part of me was disappointed, and part of me was simply thrilled it wasn�t a Ford Taurus.

I opened up the trunk to put my luggage inside, and expected to have to do certain acrobatic tricks to load my two bags.  Well, I was wrong again.  If you ever hit a cow on the road and managed to keep the car running, you could probably toss that bovine right in the trunk <i>and</i> still have room for your bags.  I was in awe as to how much trunk room there was.

I then opened the door, and discovered just how they managed to get a huge trunk inside that car.  They took it out of the cabin space.

I�m six feet tall, so I would guess that�s the size of the average American male these days.  Chevrolet must have short engineers and quality control technicians, because I had that drivers seat all the way back yet I was cramped.  It wasn�t as uncomfortable as it could have been, but still my legs wouldn�t stretch out.  I would hate to have to drive this car cross-country.

I started the car, thinking that this little four-cylinder car would have less power than a sneeze.  I was wrong yet again.

What I didn�t know was that they managed to stuff a V-6 inside that engine compartment.  As I mashed the gas pedal, the front wheels spun on the pavement and the car took off like a rocket!  I�m sure that Avis was probably wondering if their car was coming back on a tow truck as I left their parking lot.

Since it wasn�t my gas, and wasn�t my tires and wasn�t my car, I decided with that kind of engine power, I was going to have some fun that week.

Did I time how long it would take for me to get from zero to sixty?  No.  I simply didn�t have the time (literally).  By the time I hit the gas and was able to check my watch, I was already surpassing sixty.  I�m not saying that this car is as fast as say, a Corvette, but by God this was the fastest car I�ve been inside of in ages.

The V-6 also provided the car with a ton of power.  There were a few rolling hills in the outskirts and on US-275, and this little car climbed the hills with the vigor of a jetfighter.  I had to keep my eye on the speedometer, because I found myself upwards of 80-85 mph more than I cared.  It was very hard to get used to a 65-mph speed limit when I�m used to 75 out in Colorado.

For a small car with a surprisingly large engine, I was surprised just how quiet that engine was.  In fact, I was impressed with how quiet the ride was.  I didn�t hear the droning of the road underneath the car as I would have expected in a compact.  It scores bonus points for this feature.

This car probably would have had excellent gas mileage if I weren�t driving like a schmuck the whole week.  I think I averaged about 12 or 13 miles per gallon, but I was not being a typical driver.

Perhaps my biggest complaint about the Malibu was the car stereo.  I�m pretty good with electronics, and can figure out most anything given a few minutes.  I spent all week tinkering with the stereo, and could find no Scan button, nor could I figure out exactly what three of the other buttons did.

The windshield wipers were also a bit on the sad side.  It wasn�t that they were worn, it was that they had almost no power.  It rains every time I visit Ohio, and this past visit was certainly no exception to the rule.  The wipers couldn�t keep up with a simple Midwest rainstorm.  I�d hate to see what happens in a driving storm like we have in Colorado.

The power windows worked flawlessly.  Like the Taurus, the driver�s window can be lowered just by pushing the button once without having to hold onto it.  The passenger windows lacked this feature, but that�s very typical.

The power locks, on the other hand, were confusing.  There are actually two buttons that handle the locks.  One is the actual lock on the door itself.  It has a slide that says, �Locked� and an arrow.  I spent a few minutes fumbling with this lock, trying to figure out if I hold onto it for a few seconds and the other doors follow (as what happens with my Taurus) or if there was some other trick.  I found a few inches above that a black switch that was unmarked.  I flipped it and the doors locked and unlocked just fine.

The outside door locks were equally confusing.  I�m sure if I owned this car and spent any real amount of time driving it, I would have figured it out (along with all the other nuances).  Usually, when I turn a key in a car lock, you can feel the lock engaging or disengaging.  There was no such pressure in this car, and I had a difficult time remembering if I turn the key to the left or to the right to disengage the lock.  It�s really a minor issue, but it would be nice to actually feel the lock move so I don�t look like an idiot turning the key and jerking on a locked car door!

So, what�s my overall opinion of the 2000 Malibu?

Well, if you want an American compact to mid-size car (let�s call it a compact mid-size), I would have to recommend this vehicle.  It has plenty of pickup and handles like a dream.  However, if you�re a taller person, you will probably be quite uncomfortable.
