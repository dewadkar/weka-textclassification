<TEXT>
               I have owned my 2000 Jeep Wrangler SE for about 6 months at the time of this writing and can tell you I would do it again in an instant.  I had been looking more for a Jeep Cherokee or an Isuzu Rodeo, but when the price and options worked out perfectly with this Wrangler, I had the dealer hand me the keys for a test drive.  I have been loving it ever since.
   What you might already know about the Wrangler is that it is a fun little compact sport utility that will look just as good rolling down the boardwalk at the beach as it will rolling up a mountain not designed to allow anything to pass save for a couple species of animals.
   But what you may not know is that the Wrangler is a lifestyle changer.  Suddenly you have other Jeepers waving at you, you have people everywhere commenting on your ride, and for a 20-something single guy like me the most important thing is you have plenty of women that want to join you on your next trip down to the beach.
   The Wrangler has plenty of uses.  For utility the back seat will fold up or come out and you can have that whole back area for cargo.  For help there are plenty of groups both online and not that are eager and willing to offer advice and sometimes even meet up to help.  There are plenty of places to do that off road adventure and even more people willing to show you around the mountains and trails.
   The Wrangler is worth so much more than the money and I would not give it up for anything.<br><br>
