            Do you remember 1983? No? Then you are too young to drink! 

On our parties, we mixed our drinks with the newly introduced sugar free �Diet Sprite�, while listening to Adam Ant�s Goody Two Shoes, David Bowie making Modern Love (whatever he meant with that), Eddy Grant going down Electric Avenue, Michael Jackson doing a P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing), Prince & The Revolution driving a Little Red Corvette, despite the fact that there was no 1983 Corvette, and Donna Summer worked hard for her money.

At the movies, the gals forced us to look at Flashdance yet another time, but we preferred the Return of the Jedi. Merrill Streep as Karen Silkwood made an anti-nuclear-activist out of us all, Barb Streisand took Yentl from stage to screen and James Bond never said never again, neither would have I to Kim Basinger alias Domino Petacchi.

 Voted �Men of the Year� were, -believe it or not- Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov, the formers troops just invading Grenada.
Hurricane Alicia devastated half of Texas and the �83 El Ni�o was the strongest and most devastating of the century, perhaps the worst in recorded history. 
Berlin was still divided by a wall, still, the international committee for preservation of tropical timber was founded there and then. 
But the most notable event of the year was a little, gray, unimposing looking document handed over to me. On the front it said in bold black letters: Driver�s License. 

Why I am telling all this? Because it seems such a long time ago nowadays and the 83 Buick Park Avenue was outdated even back then. 
As a progression of GM�s new for 1977 C-Body, everything about the car is gleefully Disco-Age, despite the fact that it actually is an 83 model. From the outside, it fascinates by being square as a brick, the edges of which being encompassed by chrome moldings. Yes, there is a padded vinyl top. 
Yes, there are opera lights. 
Yes, there are opera lights. 
Yes, there are opera lights (I just can�t get over that fact!) 
Yes, there are Venti-Ports (Buick terminology for the mouse holes on the front fenders). 
Yes, there is a proudly erect chrome radiator grille. 
Yes, it is topped off with a stand-up hood ornament (at least as long as it isn�t nicked). 
Yes, there are wire wheel covers surrounded by whitewall tires. 
Yes, there are chrome bumpers that look like you can push a Union Pacific railroad engine off the track with them. These bumpers are mounted to a frame that would do for a 5-ton truck nowadays. A frame! A separate body bolted on it. A V8 Engine mounted lengthwise, driving the rear wheels via a live back axle. Generations of Americans never imagined driving a car without these attributes. Now, a whole generation never drove one with them. And no, I don�t know a doctor that didn�t own a Park Avenue in the Eighties.

After the excellent experiences I made with a 1978 Caprice, I always wanted one again. Unfortunately, Caprices not having succumbed to oxidation are hard to come by nowadays, at least in this country. To my surprise, I found this Buick in remarkable good condition, belying its almost 20 years of age. I bought it almost without hesitation. 
Call me conservative, but I once again love my car. The interior is larger than several apartments I have rented since �83, and if the woodgrain stuff, that covers a considerable portion of the interior, wouldn�t look that plasticky, I would say, it was about time to start preserving the tropical timber back then. The seats are like, well no, they don�t make any armchairs like that anymore. Upon opening a door, 15 lights come alight, and this holds true simple counting. There are folding armrests and seat belts everywhere and the seats have this loose pillow look, so you have the impression that this interior holds a lot of people. You are right; the Park Avenue seats six, in a roominess that they can still stay strangers. There is an electrical provision for almost everything. Seats, mirrors, windows, locks, trunk, and god knows what hidden gimmicks and gadgets I haven�t found yet. There are map reading lamps as well, not a bad thing in a car without a GPS navigator. Remember maps? 
All kinds of controls sprout out of the wood grain armrest to your left, in an array that belies any perceptions of modern ergonomics. They are chromed and they look like gold teeth in a skull.
The light switch is to the left on the dashboard and has to be pulled out, exactly like God and Fred Duesenberg did it in the first place. Looking out front, you see a hood reaching all the way to California, out back nothing, since the miniscule back window prevents you from it. But it is oh so formal. The spindly steering wheel, albeit with -you guessed it- wood grain, and -you guessed it- a gear selector underneath it, gives no feel for the road whatsoever. You just aim that barge in the general direction you want to go, and nail the throttle. And nailing the throttle you do a lot, since this 5,0 Liter V8 is an absolute perfect sample of cold temper. It does its duty in such a phlegmatic way, it is actually cool, never sounding stressed anyway. Cruising speed comes in at about 75, so in most areas of this planet you will be never fined for speeding. On the other hand, the world surrounding you will never perceive you as a daring driver. I actually think, most of them think I am a total lunatic cruising around with my big old barge. Excellent, because I want to be different.
