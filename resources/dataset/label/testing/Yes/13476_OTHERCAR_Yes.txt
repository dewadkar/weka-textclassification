            I bought my Metro on December 1, 1999. It was basically my first car, and I bought it because I was given $1,000 to go out and buy a car with, and the Metro was about my only option. I fell in love with my baby on day one. 

Over the year that I had my car I hit my boyfriends car, I got hit by an SUV, I hit a wall, a tree, and several other things, and never once did my car dint. After about 2 months of owning my car, I realized it had super powers. It feels like it low to the ground, but if you take a look at it, you will realize that it is not. I took my Metro for long highway trips, I took my baby off road, though 1 1/2 ft tall grass, over curbs, down the sidewalk, and pretty much anywhere your not supposed to be able to fit or drive a car, I fit and drove mine. 

She did make a few squeaks and squabbles when I drove her, but I found the easiest way to correct that problem was to turn the radio up. Also, I must have been putting in magic disappearing oil or something, because I didn't have an oil leak, and I wasn't burning it, but my oil would just disappear every once in a while. I guess she was thirsty. Everything you have heard about the great gas mileage is true. It is very conceivable for a person to forget how to pump gas in-between the times that they had to visit the gas station. 

Although I never rode in the back seat, the one or two times I sat in it I found it INCREDIBLY comfortable, and I was always content in my drivers seat. 

My Metro was always dependable, although it idled a little rough, at 139,000 miles what can you expect! I never had any major mechanical problems, until her untimely death on November 9, 2000. Her timing belt broke, and at the advice of a mechanic, we did not try to resuscitate her.*****SEE BELOW FOR UPDATE!!!!

I would recommend the 1992 Metro to anyone who needs reliable transportation at a low cost. If you have any questions feel free to contact me at Babe0807@aol.com.

THE METRO RIDES AGAIN --- VROOM VROOM VROOM!!!

Yes that's right folks, my baby is back! She now has 143,000 miles on her and is still running great! I ended up getting the timing belt replaced and she is back and running better than ever. She has been trouble free since November 21, 2000, and I couldn't be happier because I have the best little car anyone could ask for!!!
