            I think I am an excellent person to rate this van. This is my forth van owned in almost 5 years. I wrote an epinion on my 2000 Windstar(which also was about my 1998 Windstar).
Let me give you a little background:
I bought a 1996 Plymouth Voyager. I was in the shop with problems with this van so often. It was all under warantee , so it didn't cost me anything except my time. But so many things were wrong with this van(just to name a few: air conditioning failed, door locks failed, 2 batteries died, transmission kept overheating and they finally added a tranny cooler and finally the electrical system went totally haywire). I traded this hunk of junk in after 2 years for a 1998 Ford Windstar(The Odyssey model 1998 was still too small, and did not have the sliding doors yet). The windstar had the option of Traction Control, which we thought would be a good thing to have. The only problem was that the TRAC OFF light would intermittently flash, and everytime they said they fixed it by replacing something else, a few weeks later, it would flash again. After 1 year, and 20,000 miles on the van, they decided to make me happy and give me a 2000 Windstar rather than me going the Lemon Law direction. I was very happy.
OK...so until Nov. 2000,(exactly one year) I was driving my 2000 Windstar very happily, when I was in a head on collision with a Chevy Tahoe. My son and I walked out of the van literal unharmed, and my initial decision was to get a 2001 Windstar since we came out of the accident with hardly a scratch. 
Then I did a little research on Edmunds.com and found that the 2001 Honda Odyssey was redesigned in 1999 and it was worth looking into. I made the decision to purchase a 2001 Odyssey, and after owning the other 3 vans, I really like the Odyssey the best.
It is a very solid made van, with a tight handling that the other vans did not have. The turning radius is so small, that I can make a U-turn on a NYC street in one step.
I have the EX model, and that comes with the power sliding doors which are very convenient. It comes with a CD player, but the cassette is optional. The climate control is wonderful, and here in hot June in NYC, the air conditioner is wonderful. My kids say that the rear passenger room is much more roomy in this van than any of our previous vans, and behind the third seat, the cargo well is gigantic.
I have not yet used the option of folding down the rear seat, but it is good feature to have.
The only complaints I have are:

1) After you start the van, and go into drive or reverse, the doors do not lock automatically. I am very used to this from all my prior vans, and very often now, forget to lock to doors, and my 5yr old has to remind me to.
2) In my 2000 Windstar, the radio would stay on after shutting the van for about 5 minutes until you would open a door.
3) There is no overhead console, or rear passenger controls for the radio.
4)The power outlet to plug my cell phone into is all the way down near the floor...there is no reason it couldn't be higher like near the radio.

These are all convenience items that are not necessary, but being that they were on lower models of vans that I previously had, you would think they would put them on the highest model of the Odyssey.

ADDED on JULY 27, 2001:
I never had the opportunity until now to use the feature of folding down the rear seat into its well so that it disappears...Well, the other day, my daughter and I decided to buy bi-fold mirrored doors at home depot. Now, I am not a large person(5'1" female) and my daughter is alot smaller than I. The only way to fit these doors into the van was to bring down that rear seat. If I had any of my previous vans, that rear seat would have had to be removed, and being that we were at Home Depot already, there would be no place to put that seat. So #1 the convience of getting rid of the seat without having to remove it from the van is great. #2 I was able to fold it down and put it into to well with no problem at all. This is a great feature, and if you only use it once or twice, it is worth it. I thought when I bought the van..."Oh, I have 3 kids, and that feature is not important to me". But for the one time I needed it...I appreciated it.
