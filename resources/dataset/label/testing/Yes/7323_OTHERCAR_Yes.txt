            This is a great little digital camera and simply to use.  It has all the features you would expect on a camera in this category and the functions are pretty self evident when you pick up the camera.  The view finder is useless but the video image on the back works great, it does however decrease the battery life considerably.  All and all I find the option to delete pictures that are not worth keeping and the price saving on film and developing to more than offset the price of this camera.  My camera came with a mail in coupon for a electronic film reader that really speeds up the process of accessing the pictures.  If you purchase a camera and it doesn't come with one I would recommend you purchase one, they are made by ZIO.  Great Camera, happy pictures.
