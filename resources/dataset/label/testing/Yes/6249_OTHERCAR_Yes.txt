              I just bought a 2000 Nissan Frontier 4dr Crew Cab and couldn't be happier.  From the great price I paid for it all the way down to the smallest features, this truck is great!!!  You have the ability to carry more personnel as you do in a car, but you also have a cargo area for loads that just need more space than a back seat.
  The minute I test drove this vehicle, I knew I had to have it.  Smooth as silk on the road, hardly ever feeling the bumps under the horribly maintained roads where I live.  The bucket seats in the front are exceptionally comfortable, especially for truck standards.  And when it comes to car pooling friends and family around, not a problem, I have a full bench seat in the back that is just as comfortable.  I recently had 5 people in the truck at the same time, and no one complained of not having enough room for the entire 2 hour road trip we took.  
  So maybe I should have bought a car, NOT A CHANCE!!  I need the ability to carry gear from time to time, and the bed is the greatest way to do it.  It has a standard 4 foot bed, but with the ease and snap of the bed extender, making room for larger loads is no problem at all.  Just flip it down, lock it in place and you are set.  Camping days are here again.  And with the optional roof rack I purchased, I now have room for my snowboards as well.
  The interior is well designed, and all the buttons for AC, Radio/CD, etc are well in reach of the driver so you don't lose your concentration on the road.  Standard air bags and ABS add to the safety of this truck as well.
  So, if you are in need of more room for people but still need room for that cargo from time to time, this is the way to go. Nissan has done a great job over it's competitors in providing safe reliable, and comfortable transportation for all your needs.<br><br>
