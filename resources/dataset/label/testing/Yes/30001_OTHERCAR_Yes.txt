            <b>Entire Line</b>

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class has been a long awaited restyling of the previous body style.  While the previous C-Class models retain excellent resale value and classicism, this new breed of C's promises even more.

The C-Class now offers four different models to choose from.  The C230 Kompressor Sport Coupe is a two door 'hatch' starting at around $25,000.00 with a supercharged 4 banger making 192HP.  This engine is also found in the SLK230 Kompressor.  The C240 Sedan is a 2.6L 6 cylinder engine with 168HP starting around $31,500.00.  The C320 sedan is a 6 cylinder that produces 215HP, starting around $37,500.00.  The same basic 3.2L engine is found in the E320, ML320, SLK320 and the CLK320.  Finally, an autobahn screamer, the C32 AMG, basically a C320 on Steroids.  This beauty starts at around $50,000.  The car produces 349HP via a 3.2L supercharged AMG engine.

All the C-Class cars have dual-zone temperature controls, roadside assistance for life, pre-wiring for voice control and Motorola mobile telephone,


<b>C230 Kompressor Sports Coupe</b>

There has been a lot of controversy as to the looks of this car.  Some people say it resembles a Dodge Neon.  Well, it does at some angles.  But then again, many cars look alike nowadays.  The C230K is an excellent way for Mercedes-Benz to try and attract entry-level buyers.  The car comes with a list of standard features, as you'd expect from any Mercedes-Benz.  The C230K's standard cloth appointed interior comes to my eyes as a bit too tacky, the designs in the cloth are a bit too harsh for eyes.  I'd opt for the leather in any case.  If you're looking to buy a C230K right off your dealer's lot, be cautioned that every C-Coupe you find will most likely be fitted the same way.  If the absence of leather, COMMAND navigation, Tele-Aid, and the wheel packages aren't bothersome, then have at it!  The wheel package adds 17" wheels and high performance tires, color keyed door handles (painted body color), a leather wrapped shifter, and drilled Aluminium pedals.  I'd surely get that package if anything else.

The C230K's transmission can either be a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic with shift feature.  The 6-speed manual has a solid feel, similiar to the shifter found in the Audi S4.  Thumbs up, again on that!

The C230K's sound system isn't all that great if you're looking to pump your music up loud and jam.  If you're looking for that, select the Bose sound system package.  This package does nothing for the head unit in the cabin, but alters the speakers, number of speakers, and will add a more rich vibrant bass into you car.

The panorama roof in the C230K reminds me of the panorama roof in the new Porsche Targa.  Basically, there are two sunroofs (one in front, one in back).  The front can tilt back and reveal an open sky.  The rear cannot open, but there is an automatic sunshade for both roofs that can be closed by the snap of a button.

Xenon HID headlights are not yet available from the factory for the new C230K.  I am sure that it will be added to the list of selected options before long.

Tele-Aid, which is a better version of Onstar is only availble as an option.  The C240/C320/C32 AMG have this feature as standard.  I would strongly recommend selecting this feature as it has many safety advantages.

<b>C240/C320 Sedans</b>

The only difference between the two cars is obviously the engine and the power?  Not true.  There are more standard features in the C320 than in the C240.  Both are great cars, but the C240 is more of an entry level car than the C320.

The C320 comes standard with power front seats with three position memory for both sides and power steering column for the driver, 5-speed automatic transmission, Bose premium sound system, dual zone temperature controls with LCD readout and activated charcoal filtering system.  All of these are options on the C240, with exception for the activated charcoal filter (it isn't available).

These two C's ride on some 16" alloy wheels that aren't to the best of my liking.  They are somewhat remiscnent of wheel covers.  The sport package adds a more hefty looking 16" wheel with a larger stance on the ground.  But the wheel wells on the C's beg for 17" wheels.  The sport package also adds a more stiff suspension (and a slightly harsher ride), more sporty side sills and front air intake, patterned interior aluminium trim, and blue tinted glass.  A  $3,000.00 option that you may want to consider.  Honestly, for $3,000.00, they could have thrown some bigger wheels in.  Why Mercedes?  Why?  Why are you so behind in times sometimes?!

The C320 speeds to 60MPH from a standstill in 6.9 seconds.  Acceleration seems effortless, and you may feel as if you're not going very fast, but indeed you are.  High end power in the C320 is excellent.  Passing power is impressive, and very quiet.  The car does seem to lose all power if it slips, it tends to 'die' for a brief moment in time... I found it to be quite odd.

The operations inside any of the C's may be a bit disturbing to first time Mercedes customers, but become very easy to deal with later on as one becomes accustomed.  Some may find they wouldn't want it any other way!

The driver can program many functions from the steering wheel's controls.  There are 8 multifunction buttons on the steering wheel that control features such as:  daytime running lights, exterior light delay time, exit assistance, radio/navigation volume, radio controls, interior lamp delay time, and many others.  The driver can also select if he wants to see the speed displayed on the screen underneath the speedometer in a digital form.

The SmartKey has no metal key that inserts into the steering column.  The metal portion of the key is hidden inside the key itself, and can be removed easily.  I'd bet that you'd never really have to use the metal key in your life.  The metal key locks and unlocks the glove box and the permanent trunk lock (If you have pass through seats, they will be disabled if the trunk is locked with the metal key).  The metal key can also unlock the driver's side door in an emergency.  The SmartKey weighs much less than Volkswagen or Audi's keys, and it is much less bulky.  The SmartKey also stores a code that will activate your selected memory position in the car, temperature preferences, vehicle options, and radio preferences.

Both the C240 and C320 come standard with leather seating surfaces and leatherette bolsters, there is an option to get full leather (and the sport package will also add full leather).  This is completely up to the driver, some drives will be able to feel the difference, others may not.  The full leather also includes genuine skins on the door panels.

All the C family cars wear the star.  Isn't that enough?

The C-Class is an excellent car for any smaller family or couple that is looking for a fairly well priced great looking car.  The C sedans are pretty much S-Class juniors.  I have mistaken an S-Class for a C, and vice-versa.

Mercedes plays games with people... along with Audi.  The options game... you can NEVER find the exact car you want equipped the way you want it right at the dealership.  This is a game that the dealers take 50% credit for.  A C, E, CLK, SLK, or ML class with xenon headlamps is almost impossible to find.  To get navigation on a car where it isn't standard is also impossible.  I don't know why they play these sort of games with people?!  You must order these cars, and it will take anywhere from 3-24 months to arrive.
