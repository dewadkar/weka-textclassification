            I bought my '95 caravan 2 years ago. It was a Bank repo and I got an extremly good deal. I have only had 1 problem with my van and that was with the radio. I replaced it with a new one and my caravan is now the perfect vehicle. I have 5 children and there is room for everyone. The built in child seats are a great plus also. To any one with children I highly recommend this minivan. I take my van to the zoo 2 times a year - round trip 270 miles. This van is a joy to drive and I get 26-28 mpg on the Highway. All the children Love the view, they can all see out no matter which seat they are in. Tilt wheel also is perfect for my build  it make the wheel fall right into my hands<br><br>
