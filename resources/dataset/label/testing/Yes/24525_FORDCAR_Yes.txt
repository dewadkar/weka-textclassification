            I purchased a leftover 2002 Ford Ranger new in November of 2002. It is the Edge model with the 4.0 liter SOHC engine, 5 speed manual transmission, and four wheel drive. The only options are the 16" mag wheels and a CD player. It is a very basic truck.
The drivers seat takes some getting used to with the fold down armrest. In the up position it is OK but with it down it encroaches upon the drivers seat a bit too far, forcing you to shift towards the door out of the contour of the seat. 
The controls are laid out very well except for the fog light switch which is over on the passenger's side of the center console. 
The field of view is excellent. Backing up in the Super Cab Ranger is a breeze.
The rear seats are sideways mounted jump seats and will accomadate children with no trouble but they are a bit small for most adults.
The 4.0 liter SOHC engine cranks out 215 Horsepower which is way more than enough power for this truck. I have towed a camper and forget it's behind me unless the wind is blowing or an 18-wheeler passes. 
After replacing the stock Goodyear Wrangler tires with Bridgestone Dueler AT Revo's the truck rides better than my wife's 1999 Honda Accord. The Goodyear tires had extremely bad vibrations that made driving the Ranger a chore. Unfortunately, the dealer I bought the truck at and Ford chose not to rectify the situation and I had to buy replacements myself. This will weigh heavily on my next vehicle purchase decision. 
Handling is decent for a 4x4. But remember, like any four wheel drive with a high center of gravity the Ford Ranger can roll if you hang curves too hard.
All in all, the Ford Ranger is a good value for the money. With some customer support and better tires, it could be unbeatable.
