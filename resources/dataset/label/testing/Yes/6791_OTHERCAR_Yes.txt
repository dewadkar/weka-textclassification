            I bought this camera because I wanted something I could take quick shots to show around in emails. For instance, I wanted to show my mom what my new apartment/neighborhood looks like. Also, if the cat was doing something cute, I wanted to be able to snap a quick picture without making a big production of it; cats are sensitive to that sort of thing, and my pictures of her usually turn out to be her staring disdainfully at the camera with an "Are you quite finished?" expression. My thought was that this little Hawking would be small and easy enough to just whip out and snap, without having to worry about wasting film on another cat shot that didn't work out.

I like the way the Hawking looks (it matches my wife's Blueberry iBook), but when it came, I was a little bemused at how cheap the plastic is. The thing really seems like it came in a cereal box. Well, I wanted a cheap camera...so here it was.

Just so you know what to expect, there's no flash, no zoom, no nothing. Just point, click, and pray.

The pictures can come out quite well, given perfect lighting conditions. If there's too little light, the camera won't work ("BOOOMP" says the camera). When there's enough light, the pictures can come out grainy if it's an indoor shot. Any contrast will be way off: A sunlit window will appear as a blinding rectangle of white. So steer clear of those contrast shots. Outdoor shots tend to have a curved, fishbowl effect at the edges.

I seem to be harping on the negatives, here, but really it's pretty much what I wanted. I generally carry it with me, and hardly notice it in my pocket. I can whip it out and grab a quick picture, and, given proper lighting, it  comes out ok. I think of it as my little spy camera.

It takes two AAA batteries, which I find more convenient than those little metal discs other cameras use.

It comes with software for both Mac and PC, so I can download the images to both computers. A base is included, so the camera can be used as a video camera for conferencing, or placed on a rock for a timed shot. It also comes with the biggest USB cable I've ever seen, which is so heavy that it pulls the camera/base off balance when plugged in.

I haven't tried the timer, and I've only brought up the thing in video mode once on my PC, just to see if it worked. But I've downloaded the pictures to both PC and Mac with no problems.
