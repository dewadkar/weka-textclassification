                Great SUV! I looked into every SUV on the road and the Durango was the best hands down. It is not too large and not a small Japanesse made wanna-be. More than enough power to haul almost anything. The only set back is the gas mileage. I put in 200 miles a day with work and this is the most comfortable vehicle out there. It can almost drive itself. If you can afford it, buy it. This truck handles like my old sports car and can hit the same turning radius.
    The paint is great as well, I have had no chips or anything. I have been off-road several times and never been stuck. I am an executive for a company so I often have several passengers. Their reaction is the same as mine every time I get into it I fall in love all over again.
