            I bought the Casio QV3000plus (the camera) because I was tired of exposed but undeveloped film filling up the kitchen drawers. My wife also has a habit of ordering double prints so we have twice as many pictures that we will never look at again laying around the house.
Anyway, when considering the purchase, I compared the camera to the Sony DSC S70, Nikon Coolpix 990 and the Olympus C3030. Initially I was sold on the Sony because it was available for $640 and had all the features I was looking for. That was before I discovered that the Casio was available with the 340 meg IBM microdrive. With this drive installed, the camera will take about 245 pictures on the highest resolution and about 2000 on the lowest resolution. Now the bad news: the batteries won't last anywhere near long enough to make use of that capacity.
The camera comes with 4 AA alkaline batteries, a soft case, the IBM microdrive, software and cables (USB, Serial and adapter, and Video). What it did not come with was an AC adaptor, rechargeable batteries and a charger. The way this camera consumes batteries, these items are more essentials than accessories. I spent an additional $100 on these &quot;accessories&quot;.
The quality of the photos are exceptional as would be expected from a 3.34 megapixel camera. The quality of prints using an Epson 740 printer and glossy paper are actually better than what we usually get with our Nikon SLR.
The only other gripes I have are that there is no microphone and speaker for the video mode and there are no USB drivers available for Windows 95. (One of the reasons I chose this over the Sony other than the Microdrive was USB compatibility). The Sony was also considerably smaller.
One other thing that affected my purchase decision was the $100 rebate from Casio. I found the camera for $799 on the web, so even with &quot;accessories&quot; it only cost about $800; about the same as or less than the Sony with a 64 Meg memory stick.<br><br>
