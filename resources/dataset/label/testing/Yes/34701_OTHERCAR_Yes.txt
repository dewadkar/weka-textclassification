            I bought this vehicle because I needed a &quot;reliable&quot; one prior to relocating to another city for a new job.  I had a old Ford that tended to make noises when I drove it and it leaked oil badly.  I won't talk too harshly about it...it got me around for almost 4 years but I didn't trust it to get me too far. I stayed within the city limits when driving it.

Prior to purchasing a car...I did my research...I got on the internet to see how much I would get for my old car and what was the going rate for new cars.  I was advised to look for a Toyota...but at the time it was too expensive for me...many dealers wanted too much for a downpayment...and I was considering my old car as a downpayment...and I was only getting $200 bucks for it.  I visited many car lots and tested many cars and either the car was going to be high maintenance, had low mileage, or cost too much.

I broke down and visited Saturn...I didn't want another american car...The Saturns were nice but another car caught my eye...it was sporty...mid size...good mileage...(reading the info on the sticker)...and the price wasn't bad at all for it being a year old.  I decided to let some unsavvy consumer purchase the car brand spanking new...lease it...return it...and get it at the depreciated value, with low mileage, and gently used.  

When I saw the maker...I was thinking...&quot;NO WAY...My dad had a Hyundai and it gave him the blues!&quot;...I was asked to just &quot;test drive&quot; it.  So I did...it was roomy, big windows, rode smoothly, and the brakes didn't squeak...my dad had major problems with the brakes...and it cost him lots of money to have them fixed.  I tested the A/C and the heat...another problem of my Dad's...everything...nothing blared out at me as a potential problem.

I was also informed that I could drive the car for 3 days...if I didn't like it I could return it and get my old car back.  I was given an acceptable downpayment on my old car so I went ahead and purchased the vehicle.  I was happy with the price and all of the options that were included.  Hyundai had come a long way.  A very long way.

I love that it gives good mileage, it handles the road very well, and has &quot;get up and go&quot;...I got the speeding ticket to prove it.  It doesn't shimmy when going fast.  It brakes on a dime and purrs like a kitten.  It is trendy...I get a lot of comments that the my Hyundai looks like the new Jaguar.  I can't see the resemblance...maybe because the Jaguar is a $50K car and the Hyundai is less than $15K.  I wanted a dependable car, that was low maintenance, and good on gas, and a little sporty, at a low price...and that is what I've gotten.  I have a lot of trunk space and the stereo system is great. My insurance didn't skyrocket as one reviewer exclaimed but it increased a little because it was a newer car.  When I purchased an alarm system for my car...my insurance decreased.

I must admit I do not like that there are not any automatic lock and unlock buttons on the passengers sides, they have to manually unlock the car.  Also, the RPM button is in the way (by the automatic gear) and can mistakenly be turned on.

Driving this car is like being in a luxury automobile enclosed in glass.  You can see everything around you.  This is advantageous when looking out of the rear view window.  For those within a budget with luxury taste, I suggest looking at the Hyundai Sonata Sedan.  Quality doesn't have to come with a high price tag. They give you a great warranty not because they anticipate problems with the vehicle but to stand behind a product that they know you will have and enjoy for years to come.  For those looking only for a name and are fearful because Hyundai doesn't seem to be as popular as Toyota or Honda...this isn't the car for you...you will only buy the car and look for problems to occur and not enjoy the fact you have a great car at a great price.<br><br>
