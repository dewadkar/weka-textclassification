            I bought the Cavalier based on recommendations from friends and a mechanic. This vehicle was the best buy for the cost and has a great warranty. It is probably one of the easiest vehicles to maintain as well as upkeep. The costs of repairs are minimal compared to our Toyota. I love it's dependability.
   I live in a climate that goes from very hot in the summer do very cold in the winter. This car takes it all in stride and always starts. It handles very well on icy roads and the ABS brakes have saved me a few times.  I am the type of driver that relies on my brakes and it has never failed me. It heats up quickly and due to where I work, I am unable to plug it in during the winter. It doesn't matter,this car has never failed me.    
   I do not get into vehicles as some may do, but the Cavalier has won me over and I have highly recommended it to anyone who wants a dependable, good looking vehicle.   
  I also love the fact that I can take my family in it as well, and always have room. This ranges form very tall adults to young adults of 5 years.     Finally I love the way it handles on the highway, even passing a big semi-truck!<br><br>
