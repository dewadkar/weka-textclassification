            I bought my Jeep used in 1997 with very few miles on it because I was sick of trying to navigate my Saab through a stint of heavy Massachusetts�s winters.  Originally I was drawn to its basic style and reputation for reliability.  It�s comical but while I bought the vehicle to survive the challenges of winter driving in New England I then moved out of the northeast and have not been in a place with significant winter weather since.

Since I spent little time in winter climates with my Jeep I can�t comment on its 4x4 capabilities with much experience.  I only used it a couple of times and it was wonderful.

I must say though that my Jeep has been a very reliable and versatile vehicle.  While it doesn�t compare with some of the larger and fancier SUVs on the market it does more than what most need.  It has always run well and has required next to no repairs beyond the basic stuff and my only complaint is that the door stripping (that protects your vehicle when others open their door and strike yours) has all come off.  It also, like all trucks and SUVs gets awful gas mileage and doesn't always offer the smoothest ride.

I would say that I am planning on keeping my Jeep as long as it keeps being as reliable and user friendly as it has been.  It has been a good vehicle and I recommend it to anyone who wants a basic SUV.
