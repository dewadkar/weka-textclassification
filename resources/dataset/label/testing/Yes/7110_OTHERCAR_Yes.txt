            Just over a year ago my wife and I bought a new '99 Miata.  It was kind of like a wedding gift to each other, being that we bought it the week after we returned from our honeymoon.  Any way you don't want to hear about that.  To make this easier to read I like to just list the pros and cons of the car.

Pros

1) peppy, not fast, but gives the feeling of flying
2) I am six foot tall and still manage to fit in the car.  I have read other opinions that stated if you are over 5'10&quot; you wouldn't be able to fit, I think they just had weight issues.
3) Affordable.  We didn't want to spend too much money on a car, but still wanted a convertible.  It was cheaper than the eclipse, and mustang.
4) Fun to drive.  This is probably the most important feature of the car.  While cruising down a small country road in the fall (NY) you fully realize why you purchased the Miata.  It is nimble and agile, and of course lets in all the sights and smells around you.

Cons

1) I love my Miata so this is the hard part.  The number one negative I could think of is the lack of power.  I have driven a number of cars, and get jealous of how fast other cars can go.  But you get what you pay for.
2) Lack of gadgets.  After driving a Vette, I realized how important buttons and accessories are to people.  If you are one of those people skip this car.  It is very plain and simple on the inside.  Personally I like the lack of accessories.

I hope I could persuade you to buy a Miata.<br><br>
