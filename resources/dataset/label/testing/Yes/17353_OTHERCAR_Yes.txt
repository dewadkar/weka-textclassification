            My parents bought a 1994 Accord EX a few years ago, and I was always impressed with that car.  It had the 4 cylinder VTEC engine, leather, moonroof, etc.  The stereo was decent, but it has a problem with volume control.

My wife and I found ourselves needing a new car.  We faced the decision of leasing versus buying, what model and make would be good for the family in the long haul.  We considered an SUV, Toyota Camry, and Honda.  I have driven Honda's for years, and I would consider myself a loyal customer.

The Honda Accord 2001 Accord EX V6 certainly doesn't disappoint.  It is actually reminiscent of my parents car, which still runs and feels great.  The car has a smooth and quiet ride as you'd expect.  Many features are standard on the EX: moonroof, power steering/locks/seats, keyless remote entry, anti-theft alarm for both the car and stereo, 200 HP engine, alloy wheels, cruise control, map lights, sunglasses holder, center island with 2 separate storage bins, spacious trunk with pass-through for long items, and leather interior.  Also, automatic climate control, A/C, and an in-dash 6 speaker 6CD/tape/radio deck!  No volume control problems, and steering wheel controls for the stereo and cruise control are a plus.

Driving is a pleasure, with tight steering and smooth stable suspension.  The acceleration can be a bit jerky if the gas is touched too hard.  Passing power is good on the highway.

Our gas mileage in the city so far has been so-so, around 21-22 mpg.  We'll soon have an extended highway trip to get that mileage figure established.

Overall, it is hard to go wrong with the Accord.  There is a well deserved reputation of quality, and this car should last for many years to come.

UPDATES March '03

Our highway mileage averages around 27mpg.  The car is a pleasure to take on road trips, and we have gone from St. Louis to Colorado, along with multiple trips between St. Louis and Iowa.  My only complaint now is that we had to have the rear brakes repaired recently, and we had at the time 36,000 miles on the car.  In fact, there is a noisemaker that began long before that which indicated the brakes needed repair.  We felt that this was a short interval to need brake work done.  Perhaps other readers can shed more light on this.  We will need the front brakes done soon also.
