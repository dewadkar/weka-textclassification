            This is the first pickup truck I have ever bought.  I have been very, very pleased with my truck.  It has more head room than some of the trucks I've ridden in, and the ride is pretty smooth unless you hit some really big holes.  
The engine seems very powerful.  It will really pick up and go when you step on the gas.  The bed is plenty large for all my needs which is hauling stuff from the nursery like mulch, etc.  I've also used it to take branches to the place in town where they chip them up. 
I have not had any mechanical trouble at all.  <br><br>
