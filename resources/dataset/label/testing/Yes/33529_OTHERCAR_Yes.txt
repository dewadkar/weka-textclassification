            I have had my 2001 Volkswagon Beetle for about a year now, and I can still sit here and say that <b>I absolutely LOVE IT</b>.

I got it new, even though it was late in the year, it was one that just hadn't sold yet, it had a total of 8 miles on it, and it had every option available I think.  It is Black with Black leather interior, heated mirrors, and an adjustable steering wheel.  Not only does the steering wheel adjust up and down but also in and out.  I loved that feature, because you can basically put the steering wheel exactly where you feel it suits you best.  

The seats are comfortable, even though I have not ridden in the back seat, I can tell that it would be small for adults to ride back there. The one and only thing I have to say about the seating, is that the front seat adjustment for sitting back or sitting up more, is still that old style.  There is a dial type of knob at the side of the seat, and you have to turn it in order to adjust the way you are sitting.  Although there is a lever that you either push push push down on or pull pull pull up on in order to lower or raise the actual seat height.  It's nice!

The arm rest can either be there in the middle or you can fold it up so that it's up even with the backs of the 2 bucket seats.  That is also a nice option.  I prefer to have it down. 

My car is a standard (5 speed) and I just love it.  The Beetle is a great car for handling, and excellent even in the winter.  I have to say though, that it's not some SMOOTH riding car over bumpy roads.  You WILL feel the bumps... but over all, it's an excellent handling car.  Even after owning it for a year, I still like to go out and drive it. For gas milage, I am getting about 30 miles per gallon. 

Some of the things I don't like about the Beetle are, the cup holders, the sun visors, and the window regulator situation.  

<b>1.</b> The cup holders are under the dash, in front of the shifter, about the only thing you can put there might be a small cup like a paper cup or cup of coffee but not a tall one.  A CAN of soda will fit there, but that's about as tall as you can go.  There is no other option for a cup holder.  It makes it difficult if you are driving and need to put your cup somewhere...  You can't very well hold it between your legs if you are driving a standard, now can you?  What I have done though is prop stuff up around my cup, in the passanger seat, so that a cup won't spill.  But what do you do if someone is riding with you?  They have to hold it for you?  I just can't stand the whole cup holder situation.

<b>2.</b> The sun visors are very small.  I don't think they are more than 5 inches wide or should I say tall... when you put your visor down, you may as well not have.  They don't block much sun at all.  They need to be a little wider, so they come down further on the windsheild.
Since the dynamics of the car are so rounded, the roof is actually high, which doesn't necessarily mean that those visors should be so small... I would think you would need MORE visor in order to get the same effect that a regular visor would do in an ordinary car.  

<b>3.</b> The Window Regulators....  In cars like mine that have power windows... there is a problem.  Just after I bought my car a friend of mine had a passot, and her driver side window regulator went bad.  Her husband worked for Volkswagon and had said that there was a problem with Passot, Jetta, and Beetles, that the window regulators have been going bad in a very short amount of time.  
For those of you who don't know what a window regulator is, the framing that holds the window inside the door is run by a little motor.  Now, either that motor is going bad, or the framing could be weakening.  But either way you look at it.  The window has a hard time going back up.
My car which is only a year old is now starting to show signs of this problem.  Thank God it's covered under the warranty.  I will have to have this looked at and fixed.
The windows are automatic, so when I put my window up, it only goes to about 1 inch from being all the way up, and it stops, and then decides to roll itself all the way down again, so I have to stop it, and put it up by holding the button until it goes up.... when it gets back to that point about 1 inch from being up, you can hear the motor start to die out, and it fights and struggles to go the rest of the way up.  If you buy this car, MAKE sure to get the warranty.  Replacing a window regulator can cost around $300 each if you don't have it covered under a warranty.

Other than these few little things, I have to say I would definitely recommend someone to buy the beetle.  They are great little cars, everyone on the roads notice you, and you always get to hear someone commenting somewhere in a parking lot about your car.  I've had so many compliments, and have seen so many kids having fun with that whole "Punch Buggy - Black" game.  As a matter of fact, a few months ago, I got out of the car at a grocery store, and I heard someone yelling from across the parking lot... <i><b>"PUNCH BUGGY BLACK"</b></i>... Here it was, a Grown Man saying this.  You'll definitely draw some attention to yourself, driving the Cutest little beetle on earth.
