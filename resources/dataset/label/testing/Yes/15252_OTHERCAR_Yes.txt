            A few years ago when my 1985 Monte Carlo finally made its trip to that big junkyard in the sky, I was forced into searching for a new vehicle.  My search was kind of limits due to major budget constraints (I am a full time student, part time employee).  After weeks of looking at cars that I knew I could never afford I test drove a 1991 Grand Am LE on a whim.  I have to tell you that I fell in love instantly.  I got in the car and took off for my favorite country road.  Once there I decided to see what the little thing could do.  I looked at the dash thinking I was going about 50 only to realize that I was actually doing more like 70.  This shocked me greatly.  
As soon as I got back to the dealer, I got the paper work started on purchasing this great handling little machine. After getting everything taken care of I was on my way home and took corners with greater confidence than I ever had.  I noticed great acceleration and even roominess for such a small car. 
That was 2 years ago and I still love my Grand Am as much as that first day.  The excellent gas mileage (27 mpg consistently) saves me money at the pump and the get up and go saves me time on the road.  Repairs have been minimal and inexpensive and maintenance is a piece of cake.  Now that I am approaching 100,000 miles, I am completely convinced that a new Grand Am is the wise way to go when next I purchase a vehicle.<br><br>
