            We have owned our 1999 Suburban for almost a year now and I know that I would never buy another vehicle again! Being a mother of 3 children who are on the go, this was the best purchase we have ever made. The roominess is wonderful. Before this we owned a Ford Explorer and just couldn't seem to fit ALL of us in with any comfort. Now we have room to spare. 
 We have also found that long trips are much more enjoyable with the added third seat with is also removable. The kids have plenty of room to stretch out and relax and my husband who is over 6 feet also rides and drives in comfort. 
 The options like the CD player and all wheel drive also makes driving nice. I prefer this model over all the other SUVs mainly because it has all the room and yet it is very manuverable in tight spots and it also fits in the garage(which is NOT true of the Ford Excursion!) 
It was a bit intimidating at first, having such a large machine, but it is great to drive and rides very smoothly. Even in 4 wheel drive the ride was great and it performed great off road!
Overall, I have had no complaints about this wonderful truck. I reccomend it to anyone, especially families. I can't think of no better SUV on the road and the new body styles are wonderful too!! <br><br>
