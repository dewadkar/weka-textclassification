            Recently my mother bought a 1999 Nissan Altima.  This car is really nice. It has a 4-cyclinder and it can get fast really quick. It has leather interior and the wooden-dash look.  There have so far been no problems with it.  She drives it to work everyday like an hour each way so she uses it quite a bit.  The gas mileage is really good, she is very happy with the way her car is.  It has 8 speakers and a CD player along with a cassette player.  This is a fun car to drive and it is very realiable.  Traction is well in the rain and the snow. The back seats along with the front seats are roomy and very comfortable.  It is a very affordable car, probably the best car for it's price!<br><br>
