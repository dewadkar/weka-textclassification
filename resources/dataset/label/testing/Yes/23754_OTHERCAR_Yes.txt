            I have had my 1998 Jetta for two years now.  I have no complaints about it.  I kind of bought it in a rush, but luckily it was a good choice.  I have had no major problems with it (knock on wood).  My Jetta is silver, which I think makes it look classier than the red or white ones.  It gets great gas mileage (27-29 freeway and 21-24 in town).  My car is only a four cylinder, but I think it out performs most other four cylinders.  I'm not big on cars and I just wanted something dependable and safe.  I think the Jetta fits that description.  One bad thing about the car is that it is slightly over priced for what you get.  You can get a comparable car for less money.<br><br>
