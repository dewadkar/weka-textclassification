            I have owned quite a few &quot;luxury&quot; cars and have driven almost all the rest.  By any criteria, the S-type is among the very best and, in my opinion, is the best Jaguar ever offered.

I got the 8-cylinder, with the &quot;Sport Package&quot; option.  It has unreal handling, a very comfortable ride for a sports sedan and all the performance you will ever really need.  You will easily be doing 80 mph on a freeway unless you are paying attention.  The manufacturing &quot;finish&quot; is just impeccable. 

My only suggestions for Jaguar are:  (1) give it the &quot;double&quot; sun-screens that are found on several cars these days and (2) make the detent on the windshield wiper &quot;stalk&quot; more positive, so that its less likely to be accidentally operated when inserting the key or turning a corner.  

I can't think of anyone who should NOT buy this car.<br><br>
