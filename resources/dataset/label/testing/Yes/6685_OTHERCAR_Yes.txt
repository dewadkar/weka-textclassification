            My mother bought this vehicle because she was looking for a vehicle with seating for four people and so that there would be room for the people in the back. This car has a lot of room, has a good sound system, runs smoothly, and runs good over all. The car has a lot of trunk space. This is car is not like the old Volvo it is round unlike the square models of the past. It is a very safe vehicle. It has bars behind the back seats so if you flip over you are still safe. It also has reinforced a-columns so you are fully protected if there is a roll over. It has side impact air bags. This car is a great value. One of the best vehicles ever made by Volvo. It is the perfect car to drive anytime. Snow,rain,sun, etc...<br><br>
