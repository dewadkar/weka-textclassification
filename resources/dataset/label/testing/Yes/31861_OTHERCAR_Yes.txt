            Dear reader.
 

    During the month of July 2002 I spent a week at Orlando, florida. My dad rented a car for us to move around, it was a 2002 Daewoo Nubira. All the big cars were rented out. The front style of this car left an impression on me the first time I saw the car. I was the drove car all the time so I had  a chance to feel what it could provide. I found myself many times Braking while the engine will rev up. I spent the time it took us to get to the Universal studio parking lot trying to figure what happen to this car. Everytime I would press the brake pedal the car will rev up. Well, this car has the pedals to close. I notice that, actually the valet parking attendent was the one to notice that. He commented about the problem when he was trying to park the car. The interior of this car is spacious for a compact. The rear seats will feel to flat at first. I like the fact that you get adjustable headrest on the rear seat. The fog lights of this car left much to be desire, the air conditioner was noisy and yet unable to cool the car many times during the week. The front seats are relatively confotable and the radio is good. The rental car had only cassete no cd avaible. The engine was loud and it did provide a good amount of responsive power. I didn't like the fact that the cars speedometer goes by 10 and there is no in between indicators for 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and so on. I have no idea who design this instrument cluster but common it is obvious that not all roads go 10,20,30 there is some that go 15,25,35,45, and it was incredibly hard trying to figure if I was a going 65 in the highway, I was trying to keep the needle right in between of the 60 and 70. The door locks are very anoying, you see they are power and you don't get a power door lock button. Everytime you get to a place you have to reach for the lock and then is place in such in akward place, to far back next to the b-pillar. The thing that I like about this car is that when you leave the car you can only lock it, with the key. There is no way of putting the lock from inside if you are leaving the car. The rear cargo area is great and the ride is very good for a small car. I found the suspension very crisp. I don't like the fact that you only get 14 inch tires. This car would be great for student just getting their license and have limited if not no budget at all.
