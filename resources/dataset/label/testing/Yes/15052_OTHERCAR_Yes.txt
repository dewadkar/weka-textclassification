            Digital photography has arrived. You probably don't need to hear this or you would not be researching the purchase of a digital camera. The higher initial cost of the camera itself is more than outweighed by the savings in film and development costs.

In addition, digital resolutions allow color prints on good color printers that rival film. The primary advantage, of course, is that the images are easily available, indexed and touched up in ways you could never do before with stacks of photos stored away in boxes.

What does this have to do with the Sony Mavica FD73? This camera provides an excellent balance between cost and features. The 10X zoom, alone, is a feature usually only found in conventional photography or on models at a much higher price. 

The key feature that sets the entire Mavica product line apart from the competition is the ability to record images to floppy disk. The FD73 has a 2X floppy drive that not only allows for convenient downloading of the images, but also for a practically infinite number of images, relying only upon the number of floppies you have available and not on the capacities of expensive flash ram cards.

Getting the images into your computer involves nothing more complicated that removing the floppy from the camera and putting it into your computer's drive. No cables, no serial port configurations, and no special software!<br><br>
