            I purchased one of the first 83s actually available for shipping November '99.  Took it to China and Sri Lanka for a couple months with great success.  When I finished a stint in American Samoa, my hard drive failed.  By the time 
I returned home and contacted Sony; I was one week over my one-year warrantee.  Thank you American Express.  My extended service due to credit card purchase allowed for free service.  I sent camera off to Sony at my expense and shot assignments with a 35mm.  When the camera came back it failed on the first disk.  Back to Sony, this time at their expense.  Camera came back and failed on the second disk.  Back to Sony.  This time they agreed to replace the drive.  I was out a camera for a month, and it was returned the day after I flew to Europe on assignment.  I came home a month later to find it sitting in front of my door notwithstanding directions to both Sony and Federal Express not to deliver the camera while I was out of town.  Camera is currently working and I still like to use it.  The problem is my experience with Sony.  Into every life....

Durability is not an easy judgement.  The camera must be kept clean as the disk drive can be compromised by a sand particle.  The long life battery option is a real plus giving you an honest two hours operation under most conditions.

I want to try the new CD camera.  While many may think the 35mm is more reliable, I lost my shutter on an Olympus coming out of Africa.  This problem was not apparent; I was traveling continuously, and returned home to boxes of unexposed film.  A Zeiss/Icon 35mm failed on me during a camel safari in the Australian Outback.  Bad news: I lost a week's pictures.  Good news: I got some film developed, found my problem, and bought a new camera as soon as I hit civilization.  Bottom line: I really do like my Mavica and want to try the CD model.
