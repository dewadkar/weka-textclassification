            I am employed by a very large pawn shop, and we've been selling items on the Ebay Auction site for around 6 months.  In the beginning, I was a Newbie to the internet, and a total stranger to digital cameras.  We were limited to taking pictures only of things we could scan.  Fortunately, a customer came in one day and sold us a Sony Mavica FD7.

This first camera required my learning without a manual, and happily, it wasn't too difficult!  It took several trial and error shots, but soon I was marveling at the ease and great shots I was getting.

The trick to putting pictures on the internet is keeping the DPI as low as possible to speed the loading time, without giving up too much picture quality in the meantime.  The Sony takes really clear, concise pictures, and though you will do better with a program like Adobe Photoshop to doctor them up, shrink them and reduce them to the minimum, you can use a picture straight off the camera just as well, unlike a scanner.  Scanners tend to make too large of a picture.

The Mavica's biggest advantage is recording the pictures to a floppy disc, and avoiding having to drag the camera to a computer to hook up and view them.  We use our camera daily, and for many reasons, and being able to take a disc home, transfer it to a web directory in your spare time, erasing the disc, and starting all over again is the best part of the deal!  The pictures come out great, the floppy is easier to use than anything, and the cost is small for a box of discs.  I wouldn't want a camera that functioned any other way.

Oh, we ended up selling the first camera, and buying ourselves a new Mavica FD73 to take its place.  This new model is $200 cheaper than the prior ones, and every bit as good!  Walmart carries it for $499!

I recommend this camera to everyone!<br><br>
