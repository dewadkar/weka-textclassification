            Don't buy one, buy two! One for the spouse because he or she will want yours. 136,000 miles today and all it's had is a tune up and breaks. (The tune up was at 100,000 miles) The truck goes hunting, has been used to pull the stumps out of 1800 feet of fence line and still gets me 80 miles a day round trip to work. Wash it up and the black beauty turns heads everywhere. The only mechanical problem I have had is the driver side mirror folding in. I took it apart, tightened it and it is much better. It is just now starting to use oil, but after all, it has been used as a 4X4 from day one. It is still just as strong as day one. When my truck finally starts asking for some new parts, I will gladly give her what she needs. She has always been there for me........One happy Dodge owner in Jacksonville Florida.
