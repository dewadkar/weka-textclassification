            It's taken me 31 years to by a new car. I've always had some silly moral hang-up about it. The design of the Villager (and the virtually identical Nissan Quest) is really streamlined, and very utilitarian. It has a sliding door on each side of the car-a big improvement over the 98 model and over most minivans in general. Perhaps the thing I like about it the best is how it drives. It feels like a large car, not a bulky truck. As I just bought it I really haven't found anything I don't like about it (or don't want to admit to myself at this early stage that there's something I don't like!)
It's really a very well designed and reliable car. My previous car was a Mercury and it was excellent.
Also, the Fall is a good time to buy 99 models of any car as dealers are wanting to stock 2000's.<br><br>
