            <b>I wanted a small SUV with good craftsmanship and gets good mileage.  I looked at all the car in the small SUV class.  These are the reasons I picked RAV4, and the one thing I didn't like about it.</b>

<b>Fun to Drive</b>
The RAV4 is very fun to drive. It has quick steering, nimble handling and big 16-inch wheels.  It is not very sensitive to crosswinds and drives more like a small car given its relatively low ground clearance.  However, don't take this car off road because the tires simply don't provide enough grip.  The brakes are powerful enough to bring the RAV4 to a stop over short distances in emergency situations. 

<b>Excellent Mileage</b>
The vehicle gets excellent mileage.  Expect to averaged between 22 and 20 mpg of regular unleaded, depending on vehicle's transmission, load and road conditions. The RAV4 can therefore go from 280 to 300 miles between fill-ups.
 
<b>Very Roomy</b>
It's easy to get in and out of the front of the RAV4.  The nicely designed interior is acceptably quiet for a small sport utility, except for that engine noise.  The large cargo area has a low, wide opening.  Happily, the entire rear seat flips forward or easily can be removed to greatly expand that area.  The rear swing-open door greatly facilitates trunk access, but Toyota should have at least made the effort to have it open on sidewalk side of the street.  

<b>Exterior and Interior Design</b>
The dashboard is remarkably well organized and sports a modern look.  The controls are ergonomically positioned.  The small steering wheel is sporty and falls well to hand, as do the gear shifter and hand brake. Visibility is excellent, and the outside mirrors are large.  The spare tire installed on the rear hatch door is placed well out of view.  As always, the assembly is meticulous, the finish is top-notch and the materials look smart. The interior presentation is finally less utilitarian. 

<b>Improvement Needed</b>
There is one deficiency in the vehicle.  It needs a larger, more potent engine.  Excessive engine noise always accompanies hard acceleration.  RAV4 has a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine. It's fine for a small sports car or economy sedan, but a bit small for a sport utility.
