              With so many of the SUVs looking like toys this vehicle is a true performer.  Built on the Montero truck chassis, the Montero Sport comes with skid plates, aggressive tires and an automatic transmission mode switch to help handle even difficult situations.  I've put this truck through a Minnesota winter, intentionally finding the deepest snow and bumpiest roads, and it never even whimpered.

  I like the exterior styling except the rear end which seems a little too &quot;curved&quot; in comparison with the somewhat boxy remainder of the exterior.  My only other complaint about the exterior is it's somewhat difficult to get at the hood with the brush guard that came with my vehicle.

  The inside is a dream, tasteful, comfortable seats and enough rear leg room for average size adults.  3 kids fit in the back seat but I wouldn't want to put 3 adults back there.  Controls are organized and intuitive, except for the cup holder that covers the radio controls.  Obviously, the designer never tried to adjust the radio with a can of pop in the cup holder.  The standard radio/cd player and speakers from Mitsubishi work well, but are a little heavy on the bass.

  I bought this vehicle because I couldn't take my 25 mile each way commute everyday in a Corolla anymore.  The Montero Sport hasn't disappointed, it's comfortable, gets decent gas mileage (18-20) and feels solid and dependable in everyday driving as well as a Minnesota snow storm.  Except for the traffic, I'm looking forward to the first snow.
