            This car flies, and looks great as it does it.  I had just got out of a lease with a Mitsubishi Galant ES, and was very happy to get out of it.  I was shopping around for a car that had a good value and also could perform.  I looked at the Pontiac Grand Am GT, Volvo S40, and Ford Taurus.  For the price the Pontiac killed the competition.  So I went with the Pontiac Grand Am GT, with Ram Air induction.  I have had the car for 3 months now, and only have two complaints.  First the back passenger seats are not that comfortable, don't even think about sitting in the middle, rock hard.  However, the front seats are very comfortable.  Also on my model the vanity mirrors don't have any lights, one feature that I truly enjoyed on the Galant, well actually my fiance enjoyed.  The car really performs well with the peppy V6 engine.  It really takes off from 0-60, and the shifting is right on.  Not something I can say about the Galant.  I am also impressed with the steering and braking.

With all that said, if you want a vehicle that is reliable, quick, and in my mind good looking, look no further then the Pontiac Grand Am GT.<br><br>
