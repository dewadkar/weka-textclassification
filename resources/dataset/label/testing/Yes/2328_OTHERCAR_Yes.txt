            I am now on my third digital camera, previous ones were a Kodak DC-10 and a that tiny Panasonic one, Toshiba PDR-M4. It has provided me with over 1000 pictures and still going strong.

I bought the camera at a large chain store and it took me two hours to get it out the door, but once I did, I have had trouble putting it down. I take pictures of everything, accidents, people with no tail-lights, police cutting me off, my friends, my family, cars for a web-site I did, and the list goes on.

It is small, light-weight, fast, and takes high-quality pictures. I do not, however, recommend that you take pictures at the lower resolution (800x600) because for some reason, they look like they've been too compressed and the image quality suffers badly.

Mine came with one 16MB and one 8MB smart media cards for holding my pictures so I have a range of 265 low-res/low-quality pictures to 16 high-quality/high-res pictures. They HQ/HR pictures look like a 4x5 print.

One of the other cool things about it, that I use a lot, is that when plugged into the computer via it's USB cable you can use it as a smart media card reader (which I have to do so my boss can get the pictures his from his camera onto the computer).

The only thing that I do not like about it is that the flash eats the battery up. You can take pictures for days in the sun-light, but when you need that flash, better remember to bring along the AC adaptor.

*** NEW INFO ***

I just got back some prints from www.ofoto.com and boy do they look good. I gave a pair of prints to a friend of mine who is studying photography and he couldn't tell me which was a real 35mm print and which one was from my camera.

Superb quality! I have yet to see a sub-$1200 camera that even comes close (with the exception of the M5 because it *is* an M4 with a zoom and a less power hungry processor).

Well in any case, I would suggest heading over to www.ofoto.com and getting some prints done, they have a fast turn around (3 days in my case) and do great work. What a great compliment to a great camera.

*** UPDATE ***

Recently I was in a motorcycle accident on my GS500E that I did an epinion on. The good news is that all I needed was some new handle bars (3rd set on that bike) but that bad news was that my camera was in my backpack and I landed on it.

This is both good and bad. Good because it still works and you couldn't tell I fell on it.

Bad because it is messed up now. It sometimes can't tell when you have changed lighting, from flurescent to outside for example. It also sometimes has a problem with the focus.

It's ok because if I turn it off and back on again, it works fine adjusts to the new lighting and re-focuses.

It truely is amazing that it's LCD display screen still works as good as the day I bought it. I will definately be buying me a PDRM-6 if Toshiba ever comes out with one.<br><br>
