            Having owned three previous Toyota's, we had high expectations for
the Sienna. So far we have not been disappointed. We wanted a roomy,
reliable replacement for a seven year old Corolla. The Sienna compared
well to the other minivans. The more I drive the Sienna, the more I
like it. The ride is comparable to a luxury car, the gas mileage is
decent for a 4000 pound vehicle. Parking is easy, the removable rear
seats come in handy for trips to Home Depot. The Sienna accelerates
well, and is easy to handle. The only negative is the fuel tank
capacity. A tank larger that 21 gallons would be nice for long
trips. We have had no problems in the two months that we have
owned the Sienna.<br><br>
