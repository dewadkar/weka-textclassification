                         We purchased this car three years ago. We currently had a Ford Taurus which gave us a lot of problems. So we decided it was time for something else. We researched many cars, and decided to buy a 1993 Chrysler Concorde. We are a family of four and we needed a reliable vehicle. We test drove the car and it drove very smooth and quiet. Since the three years have passed we only hear very little noise.
           One reason I love the car is because it drives so nicely and we haven't had any major problems with the car like we did with the Taurus. It also is a very comfortable car to ride in. We have gone on long trips and have never felt uncomfortable. Plus there is a lot of room
for us, so we don't feel cramped.
            The only thing I would complain about is that there isn't enough storage space. And you need storage when you have children.
            I think anyone would be satisfied with the car. It is a mid-size car with a sleek look to it. Few problems, and very reliable. Which is the first factor we looked into.<br><br>
