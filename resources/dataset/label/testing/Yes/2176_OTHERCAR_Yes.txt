            When I was car-shopping in 1996, I was looking for a dependable, good priced car with great gas mileage. I didn't have to look too far before finding my 1996 Toyota Corolla. 

I've had the car over three years now and besides scheduled maintenance, it has not had a visit to the shop. We are just now starting to notice our brakes going low.

The Corolla is very easy to drive and rides smoothly. The backseat is great for two adults to fit very comfortably, but it will fit three. The driver and passenger seats are also comfortable although I wouldn't want to spend the whole day in the car.

The inside is pretty roomy and having the 4-door model has been a life-saver with an infant. Once the car seat is buckled in, the baby rides comfortably, although, getting the baby in has become more difficult.

This is a great car for everyday use but not for long road trips.
