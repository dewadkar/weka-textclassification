            This is a good little car, except for the typical Ford problems, which has plagued them in the past. It seems that &quot;Attention to Detail&quot; does not translate well into Spanish. Small details such as the door window weather stripping comes loose, the &quot;center&quot; console is off center and the coffee cup that fits on the driver's side will not go into the passenger's side. The crank-up seat is unique and would be a great if you could get a tilt steering wheel to go along with it. An average 5' 10&quot; driver needs to move the front seat too far to the rear to allow all but a child to have sufficient leg room.

 These few things aside this car is fun to drive. I drove the new Chrysler &quot;Cruiser&quot; with a 2.4 engine and it was a real pooch compared to the Ford's 2.0. The controls are nicely placed and easy to read. The wagon is quick and nimble and a breeze to park in tight spaces. The ride is soft yet responsive. 

It's European roots are quite evident in it's distinctive styling. This car looks good, not like your Father's station wagon. The car has sufficient space to allow a family of three along with two dogs (English Springer Spaniels) to travel in comfort. Not your high priced, leather trimmed luxury car, just good, fun, slightly better than basic, transportation. <br><br>
