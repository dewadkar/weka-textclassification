                 Leasing my Infiniti QX4 was the BEST thing I have ever done.  I absolutely love this car.  Since it's release, this is the car I wanted.  I test drove every SUV out there.  The Pathfinder was way too bumpy, the jeep too claustrophobic, the Ford, well, its a Ford.  The other luxury SUV's were either way too large or way too expensive.  This one is perfect for me.  
     I sell real estate and it is important for me to have a classy automobile.  I have gotten so many comments on this car.  Everyone loves how comfortable the ride is.  I often forget I am in an SUV.  The drive is extremely smooth.  The leather inside is soft and of good quality.  I come from a family who buys Jaguars and this leather is softer!  The car is easily driven by a man or a woman.  It is great for families, older couples or anyone who likes to ride up high in luxury.  
     The wood accents in the interior are the epitome of class.  The interior is comparable to the finest of Rolls Royces.  The only thing that often causes problems is when my elderly grandmother rides in the car.  She often has some trouble getting in, but I assume any SUV would create such a problem.  
     There are many nice features in the Infiniti that many people dont know about.  The back seat reclines, unlike many SUV's.  Also, the front passenger seat lies back all the way so a &quot;lounge chair&quot; is created and you sit in the back seat and put your feet on the front seat.  The sun roof is also nice.  
     The nicest thing about the Infiniti is service.  I get a loaner car at no charge, and not some rent a car, but another Infiniti.  Service is prompt and thorough.  Quite a change from other car companies I have dealt with.  
     Price, price price....the obstacle many may be facing.  I leased this SUV, and I pay $317 a month! WOW!!!! I checked around, and some Kia's weren't that cheap!  I traded in my old Mitsubishi for this and I couldn't be happier.  This SUV is wonderful.  When my lease runs out, I will be back in the showroom getting another one!<br><br>
