            I bought my Acura Vigor in March 2003 on Ebay for $6200.  At the time, the car had 96,000 miles on it.  

I did a considerable amount of research before buying my Vigor.  I bought it for the following overall reasons:

- Powerful sport sedan thousands less than a new one
- One-of-a-kind car that has a fun enthusiast following
- Classy looks that have stood the test of time
- A luxury car I didn't feel guilty about buying

I'd like to use this review to share not only my review of my Vigor but also to share with you some interesting things about the Vigor you will not find in other reviews:

One thing you might be surprised to learn is that the Vigor has an active community of owner/enthusiasts that are available for support at http://www.acuravigorclub.com.  Currently this free Yahoo Group is comprised of 1,400 members who discuss Vigor-related issues, tips, tricks, and all else that is Vigor-related.  Very few cars have this kind of following.  Think of it like an extended owner's manual, except a heck of alot more fun and useful!  If you do buy a Vigor I encourage you to take advantage of this resource!

OK, so onto the review.

Exterior:  The lines are sleek and as mentioned still look good despite the fact that the car is now 11 years old.  The Vigor has cool orangish/yellow foglights that really class up the front end.  The exterior metal feels solid and does not ding easily.  The styling is overall typical Honda/Acura in that it is relatively conservative, but then again that is likely why it still looks good today!  I own a black car and personally feel that the black color classes up the Vigor up quite a bit.

Exterior features include tinted sunroof (useful), foglights, separate corner/blinker lenses, exhaust with 2-pipe trim, 16" alloy wheels which are easy to clean, and frameless windows all around which is not only attractive to look at when opening/closing the doors but is also convenient for ease of entry/exit.

Interior:  The interior is fantastic.  The GS trim level includes leather seating and I am glad I opted for this trim.  My trim is tan which I feel matches the black well.  The dash layout is convenient and there is wood trim inside that looks classy.  The windshield is big, rear defroster works well, AC runs cold, and of special note is how quiet the heater/AC system is.  The doors close with a solid sound.  There is a center console which serves as convenient stowage, and there two rear dome lights in addition to the main dome light which is nice for passengers in the back seat.  These also add an element of class to the car.  The Vigor was one of the first cars to include SRS airbags for both driver and passenger-an extra bonus.  Some controls are mounted on the steering wheel for added convenience.  The driver's seat is powered and adjustable in a variety of ways to accommodate different drivers.  The side mirrors are powered and all locks and windows are power standard.  The steering wheel feels solid and is wrapped in leather.  Really, these things are to be expected in a car of the Vigor's standing.

It is true; there are no cupholders.  A $10 add-on cupholder solves this problem quite nicely.  Some have complained about the lack of rear seat leg room.  I routinely carry passengers in the car and am always conscious of the supposedly limited room in the back seat.  However, I can honestly say I have never had a problem with passengers complaining and I am an average height person (5'8").  At any rate, I feel that in general the rear seat legroom issue is at best a minor issue.  

Audio: The stereo system is an 8-speaker DSP sound system which is still a fairly advanced stereo, even today.  You can select from different equalizer settings on the stock radio for different DSP effects.  The DSP makes it sound as if the sound envelops the listener as opposed to sounding like a stereo-only sound.  The DSP effect is aided by two unique speakers mounted to the left and right of the center dome light, making it sound as if you are in the middle of a sound stage.  The bass is responsive and the treble responsive as well, although it peaks out in extreme highs.  The stereo is exceptional for a stock system, however I am somewhat of an audiophile and found the power output and clarity of responsiveness across the sound spectrum insufficient for the type of music I listen to.  The stocksystem is still overall very clean, however if you are looking for truly great sound I'd recommend upgrading the system (which I did). 

Performance:  This is where the Vigor truly shines.  One thing you may not know by reading other reviews is that the Vigor is actually NOT 176 horsepower as stated by Acura.  In fact, the Vigor is closer to 200 horsepower.  It is well known in the enthusiast community that Honda adjusted the printed horsepower output for all three years the Vigor was produced (92-94) in order to increase sales of the more profitable Legend sedan, which might be thought of as the Vigor's big brother.  While you will not find the 200HP figure in any Vigor literature, several Vigor owners I know have tested the horsepower and the consistent measurement is closer to 200HP.

The engine is the Vigor is another interesting characteristic of this car.  The engine is a 20 valve 5-cyninder, which is unique in and of itself, but it is also longitudinally mounted, which helps more evenly distribute the car's weight and helps the Vigor handle better.  Handling is also exceptional, especially for a car that weighs just over 3200 pounds.  There is a definite "sport" feel to the suspension and it is fun to drive.  Toss it around a bit and you'll find understeer hardly noticable.  I have never driven a 5-speed but I do know they are rare.  Personally, I was looking for one close by my area but finally gave up and bought an automatic.  The AT is excellent, by the way.  It is very responsive and shifts smoothly throughout the gears, despite the fact that it's now 11 years old.  Low-end torque is excellent and is balanced quite nicely with torque in higher gears.  Unlike many cars, when you floor the car going 60, you will be going 80-85 in just a couple of seconds.  Freeway passing is not a problem.  In fact, you may find yourself passing others a little more than you're used to :-)

Performance note:  On the off-chance that you will be looking to upgrade your Vigor's performance after you purchase it, please be aware that aftermarket support for this car is VERY limited due to the limited production.  I'm not talking about replacing stock parts which are readily available from Acura, but if you are looking to bolt on things like exhaust systems, turbos, etc they are impossible to find so you will be looking at a lot of custom work which will considerably up your initial investment.

Reliability:  Acura is made by Honda, and as such the legendary reliability applies.  You will need to service the car regularly like any car, but if you treat it well, I have seen Vigors at 250,000 miles - 300,000 miles that still run like new.  My car, now at 111,000 miles, runs like new.  I can truly say it is a pleasure to drive to work each day.  I look forward to it, in fact.  I did have to replace the radiator right after I bought it and other Vigor owners I know of have also had to replace the radiator, so if you are considering a purchase make sure to get a full mechanical inspection done.  The other reliability issue with the Vigor has to do with the sound system.  The stock radio/CD player LED display sometimes shuts on and off at random times.  This is a VERY common problem on the Vigor and chances are better than 50% that if you're buying one with the stock radio that you will have this problem as well.  It is believed this problem happens because some of the internal componentry heats up too much which causes the connector to the LED to temporarily become disconnected.  Honda knew about this problem and you can actually shut off some of the radio lights by pulling out the balance/fade knob an bit more than you think you should be able to.  This will shut off the radio lights (not the LED).  I tried this and had limited success.  Compared to most other cars, these issues are very minor and are certainly manageable.  All in all, I consider the Vigor to be a highly reliable car and I am very satisfied with the way it has performed.

Overall:  I am currently looking to replace my other sedan with another Vigor which should be an indicator to how I've responded to the car.  Vigors are truly unique cars.  I have had a ton of fun driving and owning mine.  I especially like the community of people on the Internet that are dedicated Vigor owners.  That kind of support is a truly rare thing for any car.  The Vigor is also powerful, luxurious, and reasonably priced compared to most 'entry level' luxury sedans or sport sedans.
