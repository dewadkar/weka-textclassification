            In 1997, I bought this car from the Toyota dealer after my 1988 Landcruiser died for the last time.  I had experienced EXTREME problems with reliability and dependability with the Landcruiser.  (I'm not faulting them as a whole, I just happened to have a lemon of a Landcruiser.) I told the dealer that I needed a car that I could drive without any worries or fears of problems.  He steered me to the 1995 Camry and the 1995 Honda Accord.  We chose the Camry mainly because the particular Honda was owned by a smoker and the Camry wasn't.  For us, the cars were neck-in-neck up until that point.  

The Camry has been great.  It gets good gas mileage.  It wears well.  We recently had all of the standard 65K miles work done on it.  Our mechanic says the car is in great shape.

I recommend this car to anyone.  We have two small children, both in car seats.  While the space is tight during road trips, the car is spacious during in town driving.

My only minor, day-to-day problem with the car is the drink holders are located right behind the gear shift.  When you put the car in Park, it is very hard to get your drink out of the holder.  Minor point, but I thought I'd mention.

I plan on driving this car until it dies, or until I can find another pre 1990 landcruiser...<br><br>
