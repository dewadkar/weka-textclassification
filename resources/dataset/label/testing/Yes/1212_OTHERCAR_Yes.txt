            Our first Suburban and we are very happy with it. It is so comfortable that we end up driving it all the time. It will have over 20,000 miles in the first year. Bought new with a $7,000.00 discount. Had a bad switch in the odometer control and air conditioning that were fixed with out a problem.  I got this vehicle for my wife to drive back and forth to see the grandkids. There is a reason the Federal government buys a ton of suburbans and you see all of these young women driving suburbans around town and on the highway, comfort, safety and security. Onstar, a must have with kids, grandkids and the rest of us with any kind of physical problems. The phone also works anywhere we have ever been, crystal clear. We live in the mountains, snow, ice, sleet and a steep driveway. Stabilitrak takes it all in stride. First vehicle I have owned that will go up our steep, snow covered driveway without a slip or hesitation.
Room, boy do we use the room from hauling antique corner cupboards, our gigantic dog crate,and us with just all of our stuff. We traveled to Nantucket this summer with our kids and grandkids,  a two year old and six month old. We had a ton of stuff and we got it all in the back without anything on the roof. We had a great, comfortable trip. I love filling up and going over 500 miles without stopping for gas, on a trip I usually get nearly 18 mpg. I have owned plenty of gas sippers with 40  mpg, but none I wanted to drive all day long or 500 miles at a stretch. The Suburban with full leather is so easy on the back. Also with grandkids everything wipes up easily. I could go on and on, but whats the point it is just a car, but it is a darn good one!
