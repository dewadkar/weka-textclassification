            My dad wanted to buy my sister and I, two high schoolers, a car that would get us where we needed to go and not give us any problems.  It has done just that.

We bought it in 1998, and it had been through a lot.  My sister is not a good driver, and she has been in 3 accidents with it.  But it keeps going!  Besides buying a new bumper, we've barely had to put any work into fixing it to make it run.  There have been some other minor problems, like the air conditioning and heater and the antenna.  We haven't been able to get the air conditioning to run in the summer, that's when the heater works; so those need to be fixed each time the weather changes.  Other than that, the car runs fine.  

My favorite part of my Honda is the &quot;Sporty&quot; button, on the shifter.  Since its an automatic, this gives the driver a sense of being in a sports car and helps teenagers race off the starting line.  

This car gets excellent gas mileage and will run until it's dead.  Its a great car!<br><br>
