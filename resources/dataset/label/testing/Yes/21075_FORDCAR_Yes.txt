            After coming to the decision to retire our trusty 1988 Dodge Caravan, we purchased a 1999 Ford Windstar SE.

Although the Caravan was serviceable (more or less), and generally got us from Point A to Point B, it was time for an upgrade.  Plus, with a husband employed at Ford since 1999, it was time to show our company loyalty.

We've had the van for 2 weeks and have so far put close to 700 miles on it.  We love it!

The kids love the headphone jacks in the rear, so they can listen to their music, while we listen to ours (come to think of it, we like that feature too!).  They also enjoy having their own air conditioning controls.  The CD player is a big plus too.

We all enjoy the convenience of the keyless entry and the power doors (we have the optional 4 door, left and right power doors).  Loading our family of five is that much faster when the doors are open when we get the van!

The Overdrive Transmission provides plenty of punch for easy merging on the highway.  Admittedly it's a bit noisy, but I think that's the nature of the beast.  If the noise is bothersome you can disable the overdrive, but I like having access to the extra power when I need it.

There is ample room for cargo.  We haven't made any major trips in the van yet, so I don't know if I'll still feel that way after an extended drive, but the roof top carrier, in addition to the roominess of the van, should suit our needs.

The Windstar comes highly rated for safety (a concern of ours), and beat out several other Ford (and Ford related) products.  

Mileage is hovering around 20 mph (if only gas would drop back in price).

I highly recommend this to a family with children (small or large).  Some of the luxury features are not essential to an enjoyable ride, but they definitely improve the experience.<br><br>
