            I have a 1993 Ford Ranger XLT, it is the second Ranger that I have owned. The Ranger is a great truck that can handle any load that a person can throw that it. To people who sat it is a car with a very large trunk, I say&quot; whatever, they are just mad because it rides better than any other truck on the road.&quot;

 Pros: The paint quality is far better than any other vehicle that is painted by the car companies. The shape of the body is aerodynamic and round body lines makes it the sweetest truck on the roads'.

 Cons:The engine could a little more powerful but has plenty of power for the average joe.The cushion on the seat could be a little more comfortable but more comfortable than Chevy seats.

 The Engine: In my 1993 Ford Ranger have a 4.3 liter engine, even through it is 4 cylinder engine it has the power to pull a heavy with very little trouble.The fuel injected system is superior to the GM product of the same year and truck style. One thing that Ford is guilty of is how they place the intake manifold over the spark plugs cause problems for the do-it-yourself person.Other than at one little problem Ford has build a great engine to put in their small trucks.

 Body:Like I said the body has a great shape and smooth body line that gives the truck a new and better look than the other trucks that still have the boxed body styles. The strong material of the body makes the Ford Ranger one of the safest vehicles on the road and I can tell story why.

 Interior:The interior is very clean, simple , and the cloth roof stills glued to the roof unlike the S-10 trucks of 93 at sage soon as the a warm summer hits. The inside is mostly the best part of the truck just because is gives it a more elegant look.

 Handling:The twin I beam suspension is special feature that Ford has on it's vehicle that gives them a better handling and ride quality. The leaf spring on the rear end also gives the drive a sense of sit higher up from than the Ranger's pervious years. 

 Transmission:I have 5-speed manual transmission which I found to be the easiest manual to learn and drive.I have been able to ran race most other trucks of model year and small type trucks made by the other
companies.

I brought my Ranger for four $4,000 dollars and has been the best buy of my life so far. I would recommend this vehicle to any of friends or a person on the street.<br><br>
