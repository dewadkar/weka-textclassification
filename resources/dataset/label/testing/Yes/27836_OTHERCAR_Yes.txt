            August saw the day for which I had waited for ever since I got my license back (Yes, I was caught speeding.. excessively). The arrival of my parents' 1998 BMW 523 i Touring. Touring is BMW speak for estate. Many find this version more accomplished in terms of styling compared to the sedan. The extra space is useful and elegant (and speaks volumes of what an active life you lead).
I don't really know where to start here, so I'll begin with the interior. The last years have seen BMW turning out some beautifully designed interiors, where just about everything is facing the driver. Ours had leather seats, which are of decent quality (specified as Montana Leather). They adjust every way but sideways, so unless you come from another planet you should get comfortable. Also the steering column is adjustable, for both reach and rake.
The optional Steptronic automatic transmission is an excellent solution for us drivers who at times want to just cruise, while also being able to choose gear for more sporty behaviour. You leave the stick in D for a relaxed, luxurious ride. Give it a push to the left and the gearbox switches the program, taking greater advantage of the wide rev range the 2,5-litre straight six has to offer. However, when you want to decide for yourself when the car may change gear, push this stick just up and down in the sport position, and you're in manual override.
Unfortunately, I haven't found out who actually makes the stereo, but it is an 8 speaker system, with the deep sounds mounted in the roof of the luggage compartment. A bit silly by BMW's engineers, because it leaves the back-seat passengers drowning in bass. The CD changer is located in a neat side compartment in the rear. 
A good feature for safety and comfort is the multi-function steering wheel. With it, you can answer the phone, control your cruise, and switch channels on the radio, without your hand leaving the wheel.
An option I truly recommend is PDC (Park Distance Control). Small radars in the bumpers create a sound as you approach and object. The closer the object gets, the more this sound intensifies. Great for avoiding those unnecessary scratches and dents.
As always, BMW delivers a true gem of an engine. The 2,5-litre straight six has 24 valves, and delivers 170 bhp. The engine doesn't really come alive until you hit 3500 rpm. Before that, the torque curve isn't particularily impressive. This engine drives the rear wheels through a BMW Z-axle. One of the reasons to buy this car must be the sound made between 4000 and 6000 rpm (go down to your dealer and make him show you). Below that, you just can not hear it, and above it isn't particularily comfortable.
Probably the best bit about this car is the way it can handle, compared to many other cars this size. It is no roller skate, but M-Technik suspension and chassis helps. Also, ours had fitted 17 &quot; BBS RX alloys, stiffening things up. Most of the time, the traction control will keep you safe, but in the wet, or on snow, there is limited traction to go around. In such cases it is good to know that while the BMW is a typically oversteering vehicle, this is corrected easily, so if you want that rear end out, you can put it there. 
If you want only on car, with which to go skiing, boating, and driving across the country in, then I could not recommend many cars more than this.
