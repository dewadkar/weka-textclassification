            I leased a 2003 Matrix XR (manual transmission) for 39 months.

I liked the space inside the vehicle, the standard equipment (mine came with single CD player, power windows, power locks, remote locking, floor mats, trunk mat and cargo system, rear bumper protector) and the feel of the stick shift gearbox.

Good Points:
Everyone loves my car.  It's dark blue with the sporty front fender/fog lights combination and people always seem to comment on how good it looks.  Personally, I prefer the Pontiac Vibe twin (but lacked the extra $s to lease it), but popular opinion seems to be that the Matrix looks good.

There is almost nothing you can't carry in that car.  I recently moved house and fitted a dining room table, kitchen appliances and a whole host of other things in there with no problems.  My trunk mat also does a great job of stopping things from sliding around while I drive.

Rear-center seat belt. I am all for the extinction of lap belts and am glad Toyota included a 3point belt for the rear seats.

The car handles very nicely.  I drive about 200 cars a year for my job and I can say that this one turns, corners and manouevers beautifully.

The controls have a quality feel, the turn signal noises are not irritating, and the switches and knobs move easily without being flimsy.

There are plenty of storage spaces, the coin holder by the window, the 2 center bins, the door pockets.. they just go on and on.

Seats are comfortable and attractively covered.  Spill a bit of coffee and you'll never notice.

Rear wiper/washer is very useful, albeit a bit small.

Bad Points:
My radio is being replaced already.  It started making clattering noises whenever I braked and it got so bad I had to keep turning it off.  Apparently there is a problem with this so they will have to replace the entire stereo unit.  That will take 3 weeks as they have to order the parts from some warehouse in Outer Mongolia or something.

When I picked up the car they had failed to screw the lock mechanism into the glove compartment door.  So every time I opened the glovebox, the lock would fall off in my hand.  No big thing, but then I started thinking about what else they could have forgotten to screw down...

The displays are almost unreadable in bright sunlight, as they have no protection from the windshield.  The chrome effect around the dials also glints off the glass in the windshield, which can be very distracting at first.

At night, the turn signal indicator lights reflect off the chrome trim, making it seems as though the whole dashboard is blinking at you.

My stick shift XR revs loudly when I turn the car on, even though I depress the clutch completely.  I don't know that mechanically this does anything, but personally, I find it irritating.

The car is not speedy.  Unless you downshift and really pull your revs up, you will find passing other vehicles somewhat slow-going.  I've driven the XRS and there is a world of difference between the two.  If you're a speedy person, you'll pull your hair out in anything less than the XRS.

The biting point on the clutch is very high.  Making that balance between over-reving and stalling is quite an art.  Perhaps they could have worked on the clutch-gas pedal combination a little more.

In conclusion, this is a great car for someone who carts a lot of stuff or people around.  If you are looking for features and good looks at a reasonable price and don't care about the lack of power, then the Matrix XR could be great for you. 

UPDATE: I got Toyota to replace the stereo system.  This took 3 weeks.  I have had the new stereo for 5 days and it is making that noise again.  I shall update on this situation.

UPDATE:  It seems that the dealership just pretended to fix the stereo the first time. I took it back again and insisted on having it replaced.  This time the radio was returned to me without my station presets and with the clock showing the wrong time.  When they supposedly replaced it before the presets and time were correct.  All this leads me to believe that the dealership lied and only replaced it this last time.

Still, if anyone else has had a similar problem, I'd love to hear about it.

UPDATE:  The passenger side interior door handle has a "metallic" finish on it that started to peel away.  I realized this on the day I went to open the door and cut my finger open on the edge of metal/plastic that was coming away.  It eventually got worse to where you could see the white plastic handle underneath so I got the dealership to replace it for me (which was a 2 week wait for the part).

There are rattles in the interior and the passenger side, pillar mounted speaker buzzes whenever there is considerable bass on music.  It's very annoying.  In fact, I find the whole car pretty annoying now, but maybe I'm just a spoiled car snob....
