            I *love* my Geo Prizm! I bought it in October of 1993 brand-new, and it has been the most reliable, easy-to-drive, inexpensive-to-own car I've ever had. Several times I've test-driven new cars thinking to trade, but have found nothing I like as well.

The driver's seat is comfortable and adjustable. Radio and temperature controls are easily within reach. The trunk is not huge but there's plenty of room for a single person's average amount of gear. Acceleration is adequate (1.8L engine), and the automatic transmission does its job unremarkably, just as it should. I have had no problems with rusting or leaking.

The high point of this car is definitely its reliability and excellent gas mileage. I have had few problems with this car, aside from normal wear-and-tear items like tires, battery, and brakes. And it consistently gets 30+ MPG even in the city, and even at the ripe old age of 8.

In the car's lifetime I have had only two problems with it. One, it needed a new starter at age 7. (A repair or two of this type is to be expected, though.) And two, twice in its life the driver side window motor has given out and has been replaced (both times under warranty.)
