            When I went out to buy a car, I was looking for a couple things. Since I was in college and didn't have too much money, I wanted a car that was affordable. Plus, I wanted a car that had good gas mileage. I found both in my Saturn. I bought my SL1 in 1994 and have been happy with it since.

A couple features that grabbed me were the safety devices and structure and also the fact that they were a no-haggle company. Each Saturn you see that has the same features, will be the same price. 

Typically, I can get 30-35 MPG in my car, depending on where I'm going, and the weather. It drives fairly well too, although it lacks &quot;pick-up&quot; and acceleration that other cars may provide. This is a good commuting vehicle, which is what I use it for the most. 

Of course, another factor in buying a new car, is considering the service staff. At Saturn I have been very pleased with that also. They have always been extremely gracious and helpful, making me feel welcome while also taking good care of my car. 

There aren't too many negative things that I can say about the car, however, I have experienced some problems with the brakes. Since owning the car I have replaced the brakes three times, and soon it may be four. This is probably due to their not  being made of asbestos, but Saturn has paid for these replacements due to it still being under the duration of the warranty.One other problem that I had was the engine casing cracked, causing oil to leak into the coolant system. Although, this too was covered by Saturn, after a diagnostic fee.

Overall, I have been very pleased with this car and have recommended it to others already.<br><br>
