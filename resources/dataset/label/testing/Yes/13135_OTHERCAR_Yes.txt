            This is my Mother's car, but I drove it for about four months.  This car is so smooth, it doesn't even feel like you're in a car!

This car has everything!  You can change the radio station from the controls on the steering wheel, along with adjusting the volume!  Talk about convenience!

It tells you the outside temperature and you can control what temperature you want it to be on the inside.  It has dual settings, so if you want it one degrees and your passenger wants it another, they can control their side of the car!  That was good for my husband and I, as he's always hot and I'm always cold!

And the seats, well that's a whole other story!  The driver's seat is automatic and it has a memory for up to three different drivers!  This seat could be adjusted to any position!

It gets great gas mileage and is a very roomy car!  This something that I would recommend to anyone!<br><br>
