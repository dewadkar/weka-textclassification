              After talking with 2 co-workers about this camera I purchased a refurbished one. What a deal I ordered through the website using my credit card one after noon and the next afternoon it was at my door step, I couldn't believe it!!!! And with tax and shipping the total was $280.00

  I could go on and list every spec for the DC 210 but decided to share only a few! Things that matter to me:
     High resolution  1152 x 864
     Millions of colors...24 bit
     Removable memory card
     Focal distance .8 feet to infinity
     2x Zoom lens 

  Basically this camera is the same as a 35mm only in a digital version! If you would like to check out the full specs and perhaps read the owners manual then copy and paste this link into your web browser and have a look!

  Some of the successes I have had! The very first night it came I sort of set it up and figured out which buttons to push for pictures and went to an event with my son (I only had 5 minutes). I took pictures while he was competing in hopes that I was doing everything right.....Well guess what, after I got home and loaded the software and looked at the pictures I couldn't believe my eyes that they were so good!

  Since then I have taken well over a thousand pictures and everyone has come out great! With the picture easy software they are snap to load in and its great fun to edit them!

  Using the picture easy software and editing the pictures and sending to my website has been great! I have had great success selling items on Ebay for myself and others using the pictures and have made back more than I paid for the camera.

  Some people have asked if I thought I should upgrade and get a better camera because of all the pictures I take now. My answer to them is why? This camera suits my website and Ebay hosting needs very well and has paid for itself several times over!

  Good things.....Everything!!!!!

  Bad things.....If you don't pay the extra for good batteries it will eat them up!But this is normal for digital camera's.<br><br>
