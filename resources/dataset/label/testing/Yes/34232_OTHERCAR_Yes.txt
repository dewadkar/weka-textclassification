            Are you looking at a few different cars, including the Solara?  Do you want a sporty car, but don't want to give up luxury?  This is the perfect car for you.  I was debating upon a Honda Prelude, Honda Accord V6, Toyota Celica GT-S, Acura Integra Type-R, and a nice big Dodge Ram SBWB. 

I took a trip to the Toyota lot to take a peak at the GT-S, and take it for a test drive.  Once the doctor removed my legs so I could fit into the Celica (definitely not a car for tall people), I looked behind me and saw this wonderful creature.  This was the first time I had ever seen the Toyota Solara.  I got out of the Celica, asked the sales person if I could test drive that, and well, bummer, it was sold, the last one on the lot.

The dealer told me he could set me up the next day with a test drive of the Toyota Solara SE 4cyl automatic, and I said ok.  I drove the car.  This was a real base model.  As soon as I got in the car, and then got in the back seat, I was amazed.  I could fit into the back seat, without the front seat touching my knee's, I still had a LOT of room.  I was extremely excited about this car.

The Prelude was ok, but it was a 4 cylinder.  The Accord V6 had the 6 cylinder, but was only available in automatic.  The GT-S was way too cramped for me, the Integra was small (yet quick, no torque though), and the big ol' Dodge Ram cost too much to do customizable things to, such as new hood, bigger tires, etc.  The Solara was available in a v6, 5-speed, and was located 30 miles away.  I had the dealer ship it over, and I drove it, and bought it that night.

The Solara has superior torque, and has the get up and move power you would expect from a v6.  The seating, to my surprise, was leather.  The form I had filled out said the car would be cloth.  The leather is so comfortable, and the car is just perfect.  The sound system is tremendous, and the sun roof is outstandingly quiet.  The car has so many features, for instance, the headlights will turn themselves on at night, and off when you get out of the car, accessories will have 45 seconds to run (for closing windows, sunroof, etc) after the car is turned off, or until a door is opened.

This is definitely the car for you if you want luxury, and sport, combined.  If I had to break the luxury/sport into a ratio, I would have to use 100%/0%, because this is an all-luxury, all-sports car, all the time, either way you want it.  I just can't wait until I get my TRD Supercharger.

UPDATE:  I just had my alarm installed, $1,000 total.  Man those things are expensive.
