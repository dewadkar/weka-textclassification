            I had a GMC T-13 small pick-up and was looking for a bigger truck...  
WOW did I find one.. The Ford F-150 XLT Super Cab...  I drove it and feel in love with it right away.  I have the 4,6 V8..and it moves down the road and has plenty of power when you need it to pass.  The ride is car like....The gas mileage is not bad either..  The seats are feel very good even on long trips.  The three door is great and easy to get in and out of.  Extra  Bed Liner  Rain guards and Bug visor on the hood that match the color of the truck. Tinted read sliding window.  I have only had this 1997 F-150 but I want now trade it for anything...  You sit up high and can see everything.  This truck is great even for a family.  I am very happy with it..
So if you looking for a full size pick up truck give the F-150 a test drive and I think you will like it very much and may even buy one...
Have not found anything that I hate about it yet.  Time will tell but for now I love it and I am very glad that I own one....
