            My husband and I bought this car in 1996.  We had just brought home our 3rd son.  The extra space and seats are WONDERFUL!  The back of the car can be used for cargo space or fold the seats down and you have 2 extra optional seats.  That was the selling point for me, that and the 10 disk CD player.  The only problem might be possible tipping if you turn to hard. 
I must say though, at first we had some serious problems with our Montero.  We had it in the Dealer's service dept a total of 7 times in 12 months.  We even considered the &quot;lemon law&quot;. Every time we saw a fellow Montero owner, we questioned the poor guy on how his was running.  NO ONE had any problems, and the Mitsubishi people were more than helpful.  But like I said, after the problem was solved, we haven't had another one since.  The ride is smooth, the interior is plush, the price is right.  All in all, this was a smart purchase for my family.  <br><br>
