            I bought this cam because it was cheaper than the others but it was smaller too. Cam is very good for those who are not interested in taking pro pictures. Cam provides a 0.7 Meg pixels picture quality that is not so great. To get a quality that is close to a plain photo your cam must provide a 1.5 Megpixels quality pictures. Quality of pictures is satisfying but not excellent. Keep in mind that this is not a pro cam.
It's very simple to use and you'll spend about 5 min to get to know the cam. Download from Cam to PC is very easy and it does not take a very long time (depend on how many pictures you have taken). Big plus with this cam is that you can change a smart card (memory card), or you can by a bigger one.
