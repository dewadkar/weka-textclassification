            The Nissan Sentra is a good car.  It has gotten tons of awards for its value, performance, etc.  My suggestion is buy it high-end instead of purchasing a low-end Altima or Jetta.  The SE with the performance package has all the features you won't find anywhere else in most compact cars.  It has a sunroof, 16 inch wheels (the only compact car with 16!), spoiler, 180 watt audio system w/7 speakers, and some other extras.  

In essence, I'd like to say this is a small luxury car for $17,000.  Okay it won't cut it when it comes to brand, or styling, but in comfort it wins that.  It has power, everything, there's lots of room, tinted windows, the whole package.  

It also drives well.  The 145 horsepower 2.0 L engine definitely gives enough power for a car of its size.  Although the city milage isn't as good as the Ford Focus or the Toyota Echo which got 32 MPG for the city, those cars simply aren't strong.  The reason why they can conserve so much fuel is because their engines are really weak, and they don't provide enough acceleration.  If you plan on living in a city that's alright, but if you need to get somewhere, the Sentra can provide a reasonable 30 MPG on a highway, and 24 MPG in the city.  It's decent though not the best.

I really enjoyed all the features that the Nissan Sentra SE had.  However there are some gripes about the design of the car.  It's NOT ugly but its not quite as attractive as the Focus, Jetta, or Beetle, all cars in the compact size.  It has a more classic look to it.  That's not so bad actually, but the problem is the color of the car.  It doesn't come in silver.  In fact it doesn't come in any good color.  The silver that they show in the advertisements isn't really silver.  It's called Radium.  The other color choices, Heatwave (a maroon color), Iced Cappuccino (a coffee color), Granite (flat grey), Jaded (dark green), blackout (flat black), avalanche (pure white), and deja blue (dark flat blue).  Now these colors are just all plain UGLY, and totally ruin the car.  I got it in Radium anyhow, it's a sorta dull color you would find on some old knife that you owned.  It's terrible.  Volkswagon has great colors for their Beetles, their silver is outstanding.  But for some reason Nissan has terrible colors.  

So I gotta get a paint job, that'll cost a thousand.  Other than that I would say it looks good, sorta like a mini-Maxima and those don't look too bad.  The spoiler makes it look much cooler and is a must get as well as the sunroof. 

As for the driving? It's stable, comon it's all new sports car designing.  It's fast, it's got enough power, it also turns well, and gives a very smooth ride.  

The bottom line. This car has got the features, the question is more like, does it fit your needs?  If you need to be driving some highway and you also enjoy a car with some nice speed, get this.   If you plan on saving as much money as possible get a Focus.  But this definitely has what it takes to overtop the Altima at least, so it's a matter of how much room you need.  I feel the Sentra has a reasonable amount of room, an awful lot in the front but a little bit less in the back.  Still with all the features, I consider it better than a Altima GXE.
