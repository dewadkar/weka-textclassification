            Being a military man I would say I try pretty hard to stay out of the line of fire, but with the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-F77 Digital Camera you can shoot me anytime!

I have owned quite a variety of digital cameras but they all had the same problem, they didn't produce nearly the shot a film camera could shoot, until now.

If you have a digital camera do me a favor and look at it now. What does it say on the case? 1 mega pixel? 2.2 mega pixels? Now you might ask what is a mega pixel? Mega pixels are a measurement of how clear a picture is by the number of dots (or pixels) per square inch. I just traded my Kodak with 2.2 mega pixels in for the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-F77.

<b>This camera has all the bells and whistles to include:</b>

4.0 effective Mega pixel Sony Super HAD CCD 
Smart Zoom 
Rotating Carl Zeiss lens system 
Compact aluminum body 
MPEG Movie HQX with audio 
Stamina Info LITHIUM battery supplied 
Memory Stick PRO compatible 
16MB Memory Stick supplied 

What does all this "stuff" do you might ask? Let&#146s take it line by line, shall we?

<b>4.0 Mega pixels</b>

Translation, true film characteristics. Definition unmatched by its predecessors. 

<b>Smart Zoom</b>

No longer are you stuck with one zoom or a limited zoom this camera will help you capture the perfect picture! Combine it with a variety of photo printers and no one will ever know you didn't use 35mm film. 

<b>Rotating Carl Zeiss lens system</b> 

The lens actually moves to bring in a sharper and more detailed picture. 

<b>The compact aluminum body</b>

Helps you make more room in your briefcase or pocketbook and also protects it from the usual "bumps" along the way. Or if you are like me dropping it at least once a week. 

<b>MPEG Movie HQX with audio</b>

Now you are not limited to just taking pictures, you can also take small movies and have sound. Just take you camera to you computer and you can email your video. So long Blind Dates, technology is here!

<b>Stamina Info LITHIUM battery</b>

Being an aircraft electrician I have learned that a battery needs to be impact resistant or it will lose it's charge very easily. Jarring a battery will cause problems between the cells and the battery becomes worthless. This battery has the protection you need to include avoiding battery memory. Generic batteries will obtain a memory and only charge to a certain level, you don't have that worry here!

<b>Memory Stick PRO compatible 
(16MB Memory Stick supplied)</b>

You don't have to worry about being stuck with the internal memory because you have unlimited capacity as long as you can afford to purchase the additional memory chips. I would definitely suggest you buy more memory, as 16mb is not sufficient for most people. I know I have a 32 Meg chip and I fill it up rather quickly. On the 16mb chip using the best resolution you can collect about 30 pictures. Wal-Mart has 256 mb for $99 for a package of two 128mb chips. 

So in conclusion, the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-F77 Digital Camera is a must have if you truly care about the pictures you take now and plan to treasure later!
