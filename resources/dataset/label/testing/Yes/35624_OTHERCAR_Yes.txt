            I have a Malibu LS, 1998, model. At first iwasnt as impressed as i should have been. It looked to me like a &quot;glorified&quot; Lumina. I was wrong. The Chevy is a good buy in terms of Reliability, comfort and craftmanship. Its detailing measure with the best japanese cars and it is cheaper. For example , right here in Puerto Rico a Basic Toyota Camry (4 Cil.) would cost $24,000. A Chevy Malibu (6 Cil.) LS model about $20,000!!!. Obviously depreciation is a factor , but you couldnt care less when you have a car that fullfills your needs and is cheaper to  mantain. As a matter of fact , service in our local dealers (Alberic Colon) is excellent.The only thing i would have liked better in my Chevy are the brakes. They are not bad , but they could be better. The 2000 model looks and handles almost as good as mine , even though it has an extra , few &quot;horses&quot; in the 3.1 engine ....still a good buy<br><br>
