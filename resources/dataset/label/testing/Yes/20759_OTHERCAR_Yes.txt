            I have had the blazer for almost 1 1/2 years. I originally purchased the vehicle because I wanted to downsize from my full sized truck.  The reason for buying this particular style package (ZR-2) was mainly for the style.  This blazer has a very aggressive style with large oversized off-road tires, wheel flares and the spare tire on the back.  It also comes with modified suspension (stiffer) and skid plates.

I have not had a problem with an mechanical part of the vehicle.  The engine runs great and can tow up to 5000 lbs, with a class III trailer hitch.

My only dislike has been with the interior finish of the vehicle.  One section of the passenger door came apart and the carpeting on the roof in the back does not match correctly next to the seat belt attachment point.  None of these problems affect the driving but brings down the overall quality of the vehicle.

Access into the rear seats in the two door blazer can be a small problem.  There is not a lot of room to get into the back seat on the passenger side.  Once in the back seat the seats are comfortable and are placed at a nice angle.  But for taller people, there will not be enough leg room to sit comfortably for long trips.

Overall I think this is a very good vehicle.  It has a very reliable engine and nice aggressive off road styling.  It would be a great buy if you are looking for a smaller SUV.<br><br>
