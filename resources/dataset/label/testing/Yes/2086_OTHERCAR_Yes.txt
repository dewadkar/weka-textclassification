            This is the Nicest looking and preforming luxury suv i have seen on the road. A tad bit costly, but amazing. I took a ride in this luxury suv once and fell in love with it. Such asmooth ride. You could put a glass of water on the dask board and drive on a dirt road and the water wouldnt even make a riple. It is like a limo inside of SUV. a huge engine powers this baby and makes a visit to the shop about once every two or three years. There is nothing to hate about this vehicle. If you are in need for a new SUV, go check this one out and fall right and love with it. Makes a great gift for a sixteen yeear old. Hint Hint!!! This is the king of the road...Make sure your behind the wheel of this beast.<br><br>
