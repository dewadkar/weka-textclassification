            After much discussion and hesitation I decided to give up my Infiniti Q45.  I reviewed it a few months ago.  Take a look if you feel like it.  I thought I was devoted to a big, fast sedan.  One ride in my bright yellow 2000 SLK convinced me otherwise.  It is surprisingly roomy for such a small car.  I don't feel cramped at all.  Plenty of leg and body room.  My husband is 6'2&quot; and has no trouble at all.  

The interior has a decidedly retro feel.  My only complaint would be with the carbon fiber inserts on the dash and doors.  The 2001 edition has upgraded this to aluminum and it does look much better.  The controls are easy to find and use.  I got the dealership to install the 6 CD changer and it is also easy to operate.  The top comes down with the press of a button.  Talk about getting stares in the grocery store parking lot!  Quite a site to behold.  Even with the top down there is still room in the trunk.  Amazing...

With the top up there is absolutely no road noise.  I stopped at a red light the other day and did not realize until I opened the window that a generator was running on the corner next to me.  Now that's quiet!  The engine does its share of humming, but nothing you wouldn't expect from a supercharged 4 cylinder.  I do miss the 178 horsepower of the Q, but the SLK has so much low end torque that I still usually beat most cars off the line at redlights.  I know that's a redneck thing to do, but so be it!

To sum it all up, this is the greatest car I've owned to date.  I'm not an expert so I can't give you all the techno jargon (go to mbusa.com for that).  I can tell you that if you have $40,000 lying around you can either invest in the stock market and be glad 20 years down the road or you can get yourself an SLK and be glad now.  And here's a note to all of you husbands out there:  surprise your wife with one like my husband did.  You'll be pretty much foolproof for at least a year!
