            OK, so I don't own one. BIG DEAL! I would sure love to, and the chances of finding one used grow slimmer and slimmer everyday, so read my stinkin' epinions and get me money so I can buy one! If only I had all the money I spent as a kid buying every piece of literature, every model and every toy of this car, I may actually be able to buy one right now. 
The specs- v12 455hp, 0-60 5.2 seconds, top speed of 179 with airfoil, without it, all the magazines claimed it was faster, but sacrificed control, as I imagine it would. tires- big fat pirelli tires.
gas mileage was listed as 12mpg, but I know that to not be true. It was closer to 4 according to my dads friend who actually bought one and never gave me a ride in it. may he die a very slow painful death.
Just look at the lines, nothing says- I GO FAST, I GO REALLY REALLY FAST, like the countach does. just sitting there, it says- yes officer, I am aware I was speeding, and by the way, I am only here right now because I let you stop me.
negatives- the height, on our terrible roads, damage is done to these fine automobiles almost anytime they are driven off the highway. Road construction ? better back up and find an alternate route, or do thousands of dollars worth of damage, your choice.
It was a sad sad day for me when the Lamborghini dealership only minutes from my house moved away. No more could I go into the show room and look at the cars, watch them be driven around the lot and washed, and parked back inside, hear the rumble of the engine which has only one similar sound- the Nascar engine.
Oh beautiful Countach, be mine.
