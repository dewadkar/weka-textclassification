            I spent my life thinking that the Corvette is indeed the midlife crisis car for people around 40-50, luxurious and comfy, and somewhat kicking.  Driving a grey 1999 hardtop thought me otherwise.  My experience was short, but I learned my lesson about the Corvette.  Its a pure muscle car, and possibly the only true sports car you can buy without loosing an eye and a leg.

The Corvette comes with a bunch of jumbo that neither you or I care about.  Radio, air conditioner bleh blah who cares lets get down to real business.    

Lets talk about the ease of driving a sports car.  Usually, what you get is a light, powerful rocket that will fly in the direction that you want it to (this doesn't really go for the outragously priced vehicles of our time -- ferrari, porshe 911, etc, etc.)  As my enthusiasm in this area is notorious, I have tried to and have driven many sports cars under 40k.  Usually, if the car can punch, it means you will have to pay attention to it at all times.  Corvette is a clear exception.  I don't know the mechanics of the active handling system, but it seems to make it easy on you on those corners and bumps.  The 6-speed tranny is smooth and comfortable, holding the stick from the drivers seat and finding the gears before take off took me a mere minute.  And once I was on the road, I felt like I had been driving this car for days.

It almost seems like a dream.  Imagine a Silver beauty, with a 500$ Valuntine radar detector, and New Jersey Turnpike at 3AM in the morning.  But then I also had a not so enthusiastic friend, whose father actually owned the car.  Much begging and whimpering from my side paid off, and finally I had my chance.  I had told him I wouldn't hurt the baby, so we started off with a sane acceleration towards 80.  I figured I will leave the traction system untested for now, as I was sure it worked quite well.  As my friend grew more comfortable (well, at least I thought he did) I let the vehicle climb up to 90MPH.  The Corvette did this with an ease that seemed hard to believe.  Not many curves are on this highway, and braking was a major waste of time when we came across them.  I noticed my buddy giggling next to me, he seemed glad to be showing off.  Downshift and flooring the pedal cought his attention.  The pickup at this speed is supposed to be decent right?  It should take some time to reach incredibly dangerous speeds right?  WRONG!!!  135MPH(unconfirmed cause I couldn't look) before I could say ouch.  This baby was rocking.  It had been my last chance too, we were getting close to our exit.  Ever taken Goathals bridge to Staten Island?  Exit 13 I think.  The ramp is somewhat curvy, but it is quite safe to take it at around 55-65MPH even with an oldsmobile.  Well, my friend says to me, 'Take it easy on the brakes.'  Natural reaction, 'Huh?'.  Although I am no pro, I could tell we would be in serious trouble if I didn't slow down at the ramp.  He just grinned and said,'Just stop stomping the gas and don't hit the brakes.'

I told myself that I am just testing the car, and kept my feet above the brakes just in case and used the tranny to slow down the car.  The Vette took the ramp at around 100MPH, we finally heard some screeching from the tires, but I could feel no sense of oversteer.  It seemed, however, that the car was toying with me instead.  We made our way to the toll booths, which was my time to get off the drivers seat and start sobbing in desire and anguish.<br><br>
