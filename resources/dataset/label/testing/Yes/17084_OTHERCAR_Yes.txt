            The term Luxury-off-roading vehicle is best defined as the Mercedes ML class as it performs stunningly both on and off the road, giving it a super smooth and powerful ride.  Few true SUVs are more pleasant to drive than the M class.  The super smooth automatic trans. helps the ML320's V-6 to manage 0-60 in a decent 9.1 secs. All ML's are very stable for SUVs with less body lean in corners than most.  Also the ABS-assisted 4WD works great giving it solid Mercedes standards.  Other than the performance value of the ML, I must add that the ML provides top class luxury also.  Standard equipment such as permanent AWD, electronic stability program, and driver and passenger side airbags, no wonder why people are calling it #1 SUV of the year.  The ML offers cool options as well,  such as appearence which can be heavily modified with outstanding brush guards, running board, skyview roof, and much more.(I purchased mine fully loaded..which gives it a more aggressive and meaner image)  Also may I add that the premium bose sound system rocks, you can really feel the bass as you can feel it deep down in your stomach.  People looking for good off road fun while being able to drive it to the local supermarket should definitely give the ML a test drive, if you haven't already.  Among the true SUVs the ML class stands out in handling, refienment, and overall competence.  The V-8, ML 430 is one of the fastest SUVs to reach this planet.  Prices are pretty steep but the ML has an outstanding resale value which can be very relieving in the future. <br><br>
