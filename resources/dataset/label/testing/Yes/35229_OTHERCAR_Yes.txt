            I started with a brand new 1st Generation 4Runner back in 1986. I totally loved this truck. It was tough, reliable and extremely fun. After I sold it, I had a 93 Jeep(heap!) Grand Cherokee. I had nothing but trouble with it and longed for another Toyota. I finally was able to get a new 99 4Runner SR-5 5-speed. I had the dealer install the TRD supercharger I had read about in MotorTrend along with their free flowing exhaust. What a FUN beast this has turned out to be. I have had it almost a year and still love to drive it every day just as much as day one. The power is a joy to have and makes it more like a sports car with its acceleration. (0-60 in 7secs!)

I follow the 4Runner forum that has many many good discussions and tips/tricks. It has proved invaluable to me. See it for more on the 4Runner. http://forums.vmag.com/suv4runner0100<br><br>
