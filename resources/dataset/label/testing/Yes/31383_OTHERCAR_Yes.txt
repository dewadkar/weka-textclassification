            I have to admit the car is a looker.  I've always taken notice when seeing one on the streets.  I'd take the Old's styling over its twin, the Grand Am any day.  Nice large clear tail lamps, fog lights, alloy wheels and an optional spoiler make this a handsome car. The interior is stylish and the old school GM look is gone replaced with a feeling of being in a Japanese sedan. The dash itself is two tone in color and the materials are rich feeling.  The gauges are large and easy to read.  The stereo and climate control buttons and controls are large and easy to operate. The stereo includes a cassette deck as well as CD player.  The keyless remote unlocks all doors and trunk, and it actually "opens" the trunk, unlike my VW where it just "unlocks" it. The cupholders are in the center console and don't accommodate larger drinks.  There are two 12V-power outlets for a cell phone and/or radar detector.  The headlamps turn on when it becomes dark, nice touch.  The steering wheel incorporates the cruse control switches that are illuminated at night.  Front and rear passengers have plenty of legroom, but headroom seems to be a bit on the short side.  For some reason with the driver's power seat all the way down, I feel as though as I'm sitting high and I'm only 5' 11". '

There are two engine options, the 2.4L 4 cyl. which churns out 150 hp, or the 3.4L V6 at 170 hp.  I'd opt for the V6.  The 2.4L 4 cyl. is mediocre at best.  Pushing a 3000 lb. car with a four cyl can be somewhat noisy, especially under a full throttle.  The V6 has a little more oomph and is more refined.  The only benefit with the 4 cyl. Is the fuel economy (25 mpg) and it can be matted with either a 5 speed or automatic.  The V6 only accompanies an automatic.  Standard safety features include dual airbags, ABS and traction control.  The ABS all wheel disc brakes are somewhat trouble prone.  In less than 16K miles, I have gone through one set of pads and rotors.  The service manager advised me that front brake problems were common with the Alero.  Other cool safety features include: a tire pressure monitor which tells you when your tires a low on air by a light on the dashboard, and a battery rundown protection system which shuts off interior/exterior lights after 20 mins. 

The fit and finish are above par.  The doors and trunk close with a solid feel.  There's a bit of wind noise coming from the rear door area, which I will have the dealer look at the next service.  Warranty is 3yr/36K mile bumper to bumper with 24-hour roadside assistance. All in all, this is a comfortable, smooth driving car that will please most families.  It's hard to imaging that GM will be removing the Oldsmobile nameplate soon after eighty years.  Of course GM will still honor Oldsmobile's warranty and service will be conducted at any authorized GM dealer.
