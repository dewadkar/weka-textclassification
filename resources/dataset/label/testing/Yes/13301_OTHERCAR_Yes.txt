            During a class held in Newport News, Virginia, our company rented a <b>1997 Dodge Stratus</b> for our staff to go to and from a weeklong class.  Since I was the designated driver for our group, I was able to drive this vehicle all week long.

The Dodge Stratus surprised me totally.  I was impressed at the amount of leg and head room in the vehicle and the trunk space.  I had originally thought of the Stratus as a small car because that was what the rental car company was saying about it, but if this is small, I don't know what is big!  

During our time there, we drove over a remarkable area of terrain, including the Interstate for two separate 1 1/2 hour trips, over hills and backroads, and on the beach of all places. In each instance the car handled remarkably well, griping the road, and having incredible pickup.  The car excelerated well in rush hour traffic which gave me confidence to zip in and out as I would in my own vehicle. 

Being that this was a rental car, we did not have a fully loaded car.  However we did have an AM/FM radio, air conditioning, tilt wheel, cruise control, and power doors.  

Overall, we must have put several hundred miles on the car during the breaks from the classes, and I was extremely impressed with the vehicle.  However, the evening before we were to turn the car in, I was even more impressed with what was to come to pass.

As one of my friends and I were shopping in a mall the evening before returning back home, the entire area was covered by severe thunderstorms which were sending out hail stones which were the size of golf-balls.  As we stood helplessly watching through the doors, we saw car after car being pelted by these hailstones and swept by the rain and wind.  It was one of the worst storms I have ever seen in my entire life.  As the storm subsided, we saw that there were a great many vehicles there which had suffered massive hail damage.

We were terrified that we were going to see our Stratus in shambles as the other individuals did, and since we rented this car we were wondering how the liability factor would go.  As we returned to the car, we were <i>EXTREMELY</i> pleased to see that NONE of the windows were burst from the car and other than a few minor dents in the roof, that the car had escaped damage.  Other vehicles which were around that area were literally destroyed by that storm.

After seeing that and knowing the performance of the Stratus during our week stay there, I was seriously wondering if I should go ahead and buy one at that time.  However, in 1997, I was not really economically empowered to purchase one then.  But if I had been, I would have seriously have thought about purchasing this vehicle.

<i>The following is the specification for the Dodge Stratus which we drove: 4 Cylinder, 2.0 Liter, 132 Horsepower Engine, air-conditioning, tilt steering, cruise control, and AM/FM/cassette player.</i>
