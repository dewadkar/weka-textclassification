            I bought this car at around 72,000. It was previously owned by my father who took excellent care of it.

At around 78,000 miles I noticed what appeared to be a combination of motor oil and engine coolant leaking out of the engine block. I took it to a local Chevrolet dealer who diagnosed it as an intake manifold gasket leak. They said that normal expansion and contraction of the engine can cause this sometime. This cost some $$$ to fix but since that time there has been no additional problems. I have around 111,000 miles on it and it is still running fine.

My Lumina is silver with gray interior. It gives the appearance of a police detective car. A company I worked for was using this same vehicle for their police department and I often got a wave from a cop when I was leaving work.

The interior is roomy for a mid-size car. The seats are comfortable. The controls for the A/C, fan, lights, etc. are high on the dashboard and easy to see, especially at night. The trunk is very roomy. The 3.4 liter V6 engine is peppy.  

It&#146s not a head-turner, but if you want reliable transportation that is inexpensive, this is a car to consider.
