            Pull the keys out of your pocket. Open the car door. Next, open the garage door. You stick the key in the ignition, but before you turn on the exotic, you get the chills every time! And that shouldn't come as a shock. Besides, you're in a Ferrari. What else is new, right? Wrong. Cause this isn't your average car! 

When I heard that Ferrari was going to come out with this car, I was excited. Because when Ferrari introduces a new car, it is of something of the future. If you take a look at the older model that the F355 replaced, the 348, and you stick it next to a 2001 Porsche, you wouldn't be able to tell which is the newer automobile. Stick the F355 next to the Porsche, and you couldn't resist to declare that the Ferrari is newer- that's just the way it is! 

The F355 is available in 3 models. The F355 is discontinued though. The three models are the:

     Berlinetta- the hardtop model
     GTS- with detachable top
     Spyder- the convertible (THE SEXY ONE!!)

The F355 has a standard 6-speed manual. Optional on models is the F1 type gearbox, which equips the car with paddles on the steering wheel. The paddles,of course, are the gear shifters, and they allow for quicker and easier shifting. The F355 comes standard with 5 spoke 18&quot; wheels combined with ultra-low profile tires. And you ask what that amounts to? A skidpad of .93 G's that's what! The quad-cam V8 produces 375 HP, and like just about any racing engine, it produces its maximum HP at 8,250 RPM. Peak torque comes in at 6,000 RPM, which is music to anyone's ears. The F355 has an excellent drag coefficient due to the fact that the underbody has been carefully designed to generate downforce at high speed. The exotic is also equipped with highly sophisticated Bilstein shocks, and each has a electronically controlled actuator which can optimize the settings of the shock on milliseconds. Like most cars of its type, the F355 has limited luggage space, and when I mean limited, I mean LIMITED!!!

Since the Spyder has no roof, Ferrari has made up for the strength that any roof gives a car by stiffening the chassis, and the Spyder weighs no more than a Berlinetta. The F355 features double wishbone suspension all around combined with coil springs and an anti-roll bar for extra stability. 

For braking, the F355 receives vented discs, 11.8 inches in the front and 12.2 in the rear (ABS).

The F355 sounds like that of a Kawasaki Ninja, no joke, I heard it for myself! It is loud, very loud. And it strides to 60 MPH in 4.7 seconds, and it has a top speed of 183, beating all cars in its class: Aston Martin DB7 and Lotus Esprit V8. The 360 Modena replaced the F355 this year and is even better. Ferrari continues to amaze everyone!<br><br>
