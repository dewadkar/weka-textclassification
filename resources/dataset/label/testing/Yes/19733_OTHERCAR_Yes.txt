            (This is a review of the 1999 Cadillac Seville STS).

On Monday, January 28, 2002 at 6:30 PM, I finally traded my trusty red 1994 Cadillac DeVille for a 1999 Cadillac Seville STS.  My 1994 DeVille was in excellent condition. However, it had 90,538 miles on it and I was less than a year away from the fatal 100K milestone. I was within a hair's breadth of buying a brand new 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis LS Ultimate, however, I wanted to give Cadillac one last chance before making my final decision. The Mercury was a very nice car, but I couldn't help but notice how much more solid my eight-year old DeVille felt compared to the Marquis on my drive home. I arrived at the local Cadillac dealer and spotted a pristine white STS. This particular example had 27,539 miles on the odometer. The asking price was $29,900 - comparable to the price of the Marquis. I sat in the STS for a moment and the car was a quantum leap over the already very nice Marquis.

This particular example is finished in striking White Diamond- a special pearlescent white factory finish. Crimson Pearl is the other special finish. It is shod with P235/60R16 Goodyear Eagle V-rated blackwall tires mounted to the standard seven-spoke chromed rims. A nice touch is that these wheels no long have the separate center caps that are always being stolen or lost. The interior is Parchment (natural beige) leather trimmed with genuine zebrano wood trim. 

The STS is powered by the 32-Valve, Dual Overhead Cam, sequential fuel injection Northstar 4.6 litre V-8 giving 300 hp @ 5600 RPMs and a stump-wrenching 300 ft/lbs of torque.  This is 100 more hp than the 4.9 litre V-8 in my standard 1994 DeVille. The engine is mated to an electronically controlled standard 4-speed automatic with overdrive. The transmission fluid is said to have been formulated to last the lifetime of the car. Despite its performance aspirations, the Northstar V-8 is fairly fuel-efficient giving an average 23 MPG.

Tune-up intervals are an amazing 100,00 miles and the special Dex-Cool coolant lasts an incredible 150,000 miles! Now, I'm not sure I'm comfortable allowing for such long maintenance intervals, but it's comforting to know that the STS is capable of holding its own for such a prolonged time. I usually change my oil every 3K miles, my coolant every 2 years and my transmission fluid every 30K. It will feel weird not having to perform these services as often. 

The STS has so many mechanical and comfort features it is almost impossible to list them all here. Every day I discover something new about my car. In addition to the already excellent Northstar V-8 are other mechanical features are a Continuously Variable Road Sensing Suspension, a liquid-cooled high-output generator, (alternator?), stainless-steel exhaust system, four-wheel ABS, and an all-speed traction control. It also has the rack and pinion Magnasteer III speed-sensitive steering system with a quick 14.8:1 ratio. 

The interior of the Seville is up there with the world's best - finished in rich leather, perforated "nuance" seating areas, and a generous helping of genuine wood trim. The driver faces a bank of Lexus-esque analog instruments along with plethora of minor displays that shows average fuel economy, oil life and even transmission fluid life among other data. The driver has several choices for the instrument display: analog only, LED display only, or a combination of the two, (my preference) at the touch of a button. 

Redundant controls for the HVAC system and radio are on the steering wheel spokes. The wheel is electrically assisted tilt and telescope and even automatically swings up and out of the way when exiting the vehicle. Steering wheel position, exit position, and seating position are set for two different drivers via 2 door-mounted memory buttons. The STS also comes with two keys that automatically finds the primary and secondary driver's preferred seating, exiting, and selected radio stations when inserting the key in the ignition. This is very handy as my girlfriend and I are extremes in dimensions. I'm a fairly large 6' @ 194 lbs. and she a very petite 5'1" @ 107 lbs. The ignition switch is on the instrument panel instead of the steering column in an effort to thwart thieves. A gray valet key is also provided to start the car and open the driver's side door but prevent access to the trunk and glovebox. The key fob allows one to remotely lock and arm the security system, unlock the driver's door with one click, the remaining doors with two clicks, and open the deck lid. There is also an auto-dimming rearview mirror that features an electronic compass.
 
The seats are very comfortable and in no way feel cramped despite the fact the Seville is a somewhat smaller car than my DeVille. The seats feel as if they are tailor made to form-fit my body. Unfortunately the seat controls were mounted on the sides of the seat rather than on the doors as they are on my DeVille. One must grope to find them. However, the memory seats make this argument academic.
 
The HVAC and radio controls are very intuitive. The HVAC system is efficient and effective. Fogged windows are cleared instantly and the desired interior temperature is rapidly attained. Individual temperature control for the driver and front passenger is via two rubberized knobs to set the interior temperature between 60 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. I may desire a toasty 77 degrees, but my passenger may select a more temperate 65. There is also a climate control console in the rear compartment. Both front and rear seats are heated in HI and LO settings. 

The Delco-Bose 4.0 music system alone is worth the price of admission. It is an eight-speaker, 425-watt system with AM/FM stereo, signal seek/scan with digital display with standard CD and cassette. A weather band is an added bonus. It has something called RDS which I still haven't figured out. It's supposed to display the type of music, (i.e. rock, jazz, rap) or the name of the radio station. I've got to read the manual which is about as thick as one for a Microsoft product. Fortunately, a smaller Quick Guide is provided. Anyway, it also has a front console mounted 6-CD changer. The system gave a crisp, clear, (and loud) sound that would rival a high-end home system.  

Safety features include driver, passenger, and side airbags as well as child security rear door locks. It also has "breakaway" outside rearview mirrors. I could go into all of the STS's other comfort and convenience features such as rain-sensing wipers, cabin filtration system, illuminated entry etc., but it would probably consume all available bandwidth.

In the last two months I've had the STS on all types of roads from urban streets to the open interstate. This car handles so well that it feels as if the car is glued to the pavement. I've pulled maneuvers with this car that would leave some performance cars begging for mercy but the STS  handled them with quiet dignity - no screeching brakes, no squealing tires. The car even handled aggressive turns with a lot of grace - something I couldn't say about my 1994 DeVille and a quantum leap over that of my 1989 Brougham. Braking distances are short and smooth. Acceleration is seamless. It will easily attain the 150 MPH displayed on the analog speedometer. The exhaust note is music to my ears: aggressive but not harsh. Traction control automatically engages in slippery conditions. No more spinning wheels! 

Despite its smaller size, there is still plenty of space in the trunk. There is even a pass-through for long, thin cargo. However, there were two things I didn't like. The automatic pull-down that I've had on every Cadillac I've owned since a 1975 Sedan DeVille was absent and it had a super-stupid cost...er I mean "space-saver" tire! Get rid of this abomination! It has no business in an upscale make! 
 
Well, what else don't I like about the STS? The most annoying is that sometimes the key fob takes several tries to unlock the car. The cover for a little storage cove in the right side of the interior of the trunk occasionally falls off. I've tried to rectify this with some Velcro pads but haven't been very successful. I find this very annoying quality glitch in what is supposed to be a "world-class" car. Also, where are the little red interior lights over the rear window to display taillights, stop, and turn signals via the rear view mirror? You Cadillac enthusiasts know the ones! I desperately miss them! Also, the cruise control "stalk" is placed in a poor location near the lower right hand portion of the wheel. It's not the easiest instrument to master as it took me several attempts to set it.

The dealer experience was very pleasant as the salesman was very accommodating and didn't try to coerce me into buying, even after several visits. In fact, he was the same man who sold my friend a new 1999 Cadillac DeVille three years ago. The STS still had 10 months of the original factory warranty left on it. I purchased a GM-sponsored warranty that extended it to six years / 100K miles for peace of mind. My other Cadillacs never required any warranty work, but the STS is far more complex than those other cars. Another pleasant surprise is that my insurance didn't go up very much despite the STS being a performance model. 

The Cadillac Seville is an excellent choice as a new car. It is an even better selection as a used car. I suggest anybody in the market for a new near-luxury car take a serious look at a pre-owned STS and get a genuine luxury car for the same price! You'll be glad you did!
