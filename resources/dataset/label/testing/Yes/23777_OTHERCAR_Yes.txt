            WARNING! This review should be read for entertainment purposes only! (Though if you can read between the lines, it does say quite a bit about the car.) I earlier posted a serious, if still humorous, review of the Echo that made no attempt to include everything that peeves me when reading auto reviews.

Hi!  I'm Michael's friend, Morris Ronald!  (You can call me Moe.)  Michael let me use his Epinions account to tell you about the great car I just bought. It's a red car made by Toyota.  They call it an Echo.  What a great car!  Let me tell you all about it!

The car had a nice hard plastic steering wheel.  I bet this wheel will never break, unlike some of those artsy-fartsy leather-wrapped ones.  When I turn the wheel to the left, the car goes to the left.  When I turn the wheel to the right, the car goes to the right.  Amazing!  The McPherson Struts are awesome!  All cars should have them!  Even better, when turning the car leans quite a bit, so I can tell which way I am going even when I close my eyes or am busy talking on my phone!

Now before you reprimand me, I do tend to drive with my eyes open.  In fact, I strongly recommend this!  In fact, one thing I hate is a dirty windshield!  I really like to look out the front when I drive!  This is easy in the Echo.  You sit really, really high.  Also, there's none of them dials directly in front to block your view.  They're in the middle of the dash.  You don't need a speedometer much in this car anyway.  It has lots of useful road noise so you can sense how fast you're going!

Getting back to the visibility thing, the Echo even has this system where you can pull on a stalk and blue fluid squirts out these holes and washes the windshield!  And to think I actually used to pay pesky homeless people to do this for me!  Now I can just ignore them! Tell them to get a job!

I guess I'm straying a bit.  Best to keep politics out of stupid car reviews.

So back to the Echo.  It has these two pedals on the floor under the dash.  Push the right one, and the car goes.  Push the left one, and the car stops.  Every time!  That's dependability!  What could be simpler?  Who could ask for anything more?  

I really like it when I push the right pedal really hard.  When you do that, this car sounds like a race car!  The V4 engine makes a bunch of cool sounding noise, kind of like my blender on liquify!  And this also seems to make the car go faster quicker!  It's a win-win situation!

The inside of this car is very large for such a small car.  Even when I bounce up and down a good six inches when going over bumps my head hardly ever hits the ceiling!  And if your head does hit the ceiling, this car actually has some stuff there so your skull won't actually come into contact with the metal roof!  

For a small car, the back seat is really big!  Inch for inch, it's got as much room as back seats twice its size!  I took my crazy aunt for a ride back there.  (She won't ride in the front seat because she thinks the air bag will kill her.)  She didn't complain about it, and she complains about everything!  She calls me her idiot nephew, but she's the idiot!  Also, I locked myself out of my house one night and had to sleep back there.  Pretty comfy!  I now have a good place to sleep when my wife and I have a fight and she kicks me out of the house!

Like the steering wheel, most of the interior is made of really nice hard plastic.  I bet it will never tear or crack!  And if it gets dirty, you can just hose it out!

I also like how the Echo looks.  Most people can easily tell it's a real car, even from a block away!  It's a real chick magnet!  Chicks dig it!  Drive one, and they'll dig you, too!  You'll have to beat them off with a stick!

Some people may think the Echo's a clownmobile that's escaped from the circus, or just plain ugly, but they're just stupid!  They're idiots!  And if I take my glasses off, it looks a little like a VW Beetle!  Cool!  The Genesis Group designed this car.  They are brilliant!  Brilliant!  This car looks as good as any Lexus!  Better even!  I wouldn't buy a Lexus even if it was free!  I'd rather have an Echo!  It's that cool!

You might worry because this car is one of the lightest available it is a &quot;death trap.&quot;  Well, that's just not true.  It has dual airbags, bars in the doors, and seatbelts AT ALL FIVE SEATING POSITIONS.  It also has an anti-roll bar in the suspension, which keeps the cars from rolling over.

I'm sure this car is very reliable.  The salesman told me that if the muffler bearing ever fails or the lubristat ever breaks, he'll refund all my money! How can you beat that?!  Those things are always breaking on crappy American cars.  I know, because I once had an American car and I had to replace the muffler bearing 17 times and the lubristat 25 times!  25 times!  I know they won't break on this car anyway, because this is a Toyota, and they never break.  Never ever.  If something does require service on your Toyota, it must be because you were mistreating the car, so you'd better just shut up, or people will know you are an idiot who does not know how to treat his car!  And you do not want that to happen, because then you'll never become an auto expert on epinions!

I can't write enough good stuff about this car!  Except I seem to have exhausted my vocabulary!  Take my word for it, it's great!  Great!  This is a great car for anyone!  If you spend more on another car you're wasting your money!  And that would be stupid!

Oh, and if you want to read a real review, read Michael's review of the Echo.  It's a little different than this one.<br><br>
