            I'll get straight to the point; the Freelander is a great, if a little quirky vehicle.  The styling draws plenty of attention, the on road dynamics are similar to a european sport wagon, and it's the only vehicle in this class besides the Jeep Liberty that can truly be considered capable off-road.

My family has owned this vehicle (an SE with upgraded stereo) for about 5 months now, and we're happy to report that there have been no mechanical problems whatsoever.  Though that's not to say there haven't been a few issues.  

For one, the large black plastic expanse of the dash has a tendency to get very hot when the vehicle is parked in the sun for more than 30 minutes, and takes some time to cool back down once the vehicle is started.  Speaking of cooling, the HVAC system is quite loud, though it does do a very good job of cooling and warming the vehicle.  Other quirks include the strange and not-so-trustworthy feeling cupholders on the dash (though this isn't really a problem, as there's also a very innovative and effective "cup belt" on the front doors), and finally, the majority of the switches (including the power windows and locks) are located in the center of the vehicle (which I've grown to like).  On the positive side, the leather is very thick and has a great tactile grain to it.  The seats, though they badly need a height adjustment knob (I hear they're working on this for the 2004), are very comfortable. At 6'5" and nearly 300 lbs, I'm only slightly wanting for more headroom (though I'm used to this in <b>any</b> vehicle), but there's plenty of leg and shoulder room, front and back. The steering colomn mounted cruise and radio controls have an interesting bi-directional interface.  For instance, if I press down on the Vol switch, the volume goes down; if I pull it up, the volume goes up.  They're very intuitive.  The crown jewel of the interior however, is the steering wheel itself.  It's quite thick (I'd guesstimate 1.5") and wrapped in leather.  It just has a great, solid, quilty feel to it.  It is a joy to operate.

The exterior of vehicle has a few interesting features as well.  On the negative side, there are entirely too many Land Rover logos.  I keep feeling like I'm advertising for them while driving down the street.  A "premium" vehicle such as the Freelander should also come standard with crossbars for the roof rails, and should at least have the option of Xenon/High Intensity headlights.  Some of the nicer features are the very bright, center mounted brake light above the full size spare, and the power retractable glass on the side-swinging rear hatch, and the large windows make for good visibilty (except for the large A-pillars up front).  The large windows and power rear hatch, when combined with a sunroof really let you open this vehicle up to the elements if you like a somewhat convertable type feel.

On the pavement, the Freelander performs brilliantly for an SUV, and even better than many cars.  The steering is extremely crisp and precise.  Power is fine, but not spectacular with a 2.5 liter V6 (which I've been told is sourced from British semi-sport car manufacturer MG) good for ~170 hp and ~175 lbs-ft. of torque. I'd guesstimate 0-60 at between 9 and 10 seconds.  The handling is exceptionally predictable, and the ride quality is very good.  The transmission really shines, especially in manumatic/sportshift/whatevertheycallitinthis mode.

Off the pavement performance is amazing for a vehicle of this size, especially with a fully independent suspension, somewhat low ground clearance, and without a genuine low range.  The lowest hanging part is likely the muffler, but I've yet to find an obstacle our Freelander couldn't handle.  I've driven the Freelander on farm trails, primitive US Forest service roads, through fields, up streams (yes, upstream, over 2-3 ft. of water), up steep, muddy, deeply pitted hills, and to a remote lake near the peak of mountain, and I've been nothing but impressed.  This is not a cute-ute, despite the independent suspension.  All the parts are extremely heavy duty and over engineered for moderate trail use.  Suspension travel is very good at 7" in the front 8" in the rear.  The shocks soak up bumps and bruises with aplomb.  It's no rock crawler, but it can and will keep up with any stock vehicle shy of a Wrangler or better.

Overall, the Freelander has been a wonderful vehicle.  It's not without a few minor flaws, but the whole package works well together.  It oozes personality, capability, comfort, and a certain hand-built quality that's rare these days.  If you need a mix of on and off road prowess you owe it to yourself to try the Freelander out for a test drive.
