            I purchased a 2001 Tiburon almost 2 months ago now.  I have less than 2000 miles on it and already I have a slight case of buyers remorse.  Yesterday I had to take it in to the repair shop.  Not a very good first impression for a first time brand new car buyer.

I'm not going to go completely bad on this car.  I must say that it's overall not a bad little car.  But had I known what I know now, I would have spent the extra $8000 for a new Celica.  My old car was a 92 Nissan that was falling apart and had T-tops, which made it very noisy going down the road.  One of the things I was so looking forward to with a new car purchase was to have something that purred as I drove down the highway.  My new Tiburon has more squeeks and rattles than my old car did.  (That was what it was in the shop for - nothing major).  Every time I hit a bump, it sounded like I had crickets in my car.  And when I accelerated or decelerated, there was a rubbing/grinding noise coming from the engine that was quite loud, you could even hear it over the stereo.  Plus, the brakes have a very high pitched squeel, which both the salesman and the service repair man insists is normal.  My 92 Nissan didn't squeel that much even when the brakes were ready to be changed.  Also, don't expect your CD player to work until it has about 10 minutes to warm up.

As for the styling, I think it looks very sharp and unique.  I get many compliments on it.  I like the curves of the body, the round headlights, and the little spoiler that's molded with the shape of the body and has a very thin tail light in it.  The inside is a little "plastic" looking, but it's not bad.  People say it looks like a space ship the way all the controls are designed.  I personally wouldn't go that far, but it is also unique.  The inside is very small, but I'm a small person and I find it very comfortable.  I opted for the leather interior.  I'm not a fan of leather interior, but the only other alternative is the tackiest looking tiger striped cloth design I've ever seen.  Reminds me of the 80's punk era.  I also have the power sunroof, which I haven't had the opportunity to use yet, being that I'm in Wisconsin and have only had it since January.  But I am a little disappointed that it is opaque.  I'd love it if I could have the sun coming through on a cold winter day to help ease the winter-time blues.  Oh, and one more thing...this car has absolutely NO "get-up-and-go".  If it's racing you have in mind, keep looking.  It looks fast, but looks are very deceiving.

Over-all, I don't completely regret my purchase.  Only because it's what my budget allowed.  Where else can you get a brand new car with leather, CD, power sunroof, and many other options for 16K.  And the warranty can't be beat, and it's cute to top it off.  If I had a higher budget, I definately would have opted for the new Toyota Celica though.  Just beware, you get what you pay for in this car.  If you have a higher budget, I'd pass on this one.
