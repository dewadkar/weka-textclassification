            We bought this car a few years ago to replace our '89 Trans AM. Our old car was falling apart and we needed a new one bad. This was a very good investment on our part..

<b>The best features of the Cirrus are:</b>

Room. This car is very roomy. It seats 4 - 5 and there is enough space for everyone. Even when you recline your chair back, there is plenty of leg room for the people in the backseat.

Price. This car only cost 15,000 which is pretty good by todays standards. We didnt get that many extras, like a cd player or anything, but it's nice.


Reliablity / Customer Service. This car has been working fine since we bought it, we the exception of the brakes. The first month we got it the brakes went bad, so we took it back to the Chrysler Dealership where we bought it, and they took care of it immediately. We took in back late in the afternoon, and they gave us a very nice car to drive home with. The next day we drove back and picked it up, and we had no problems since. The support and feel of the Chrysler line has gotten us to buy one more car, the Sebring LXi, which I might review later on, and we plan to buy even more Chrysler cars in the future.

Comfort. You can sit anywhere in this car and go to sleep, except the front seat. While the front seat is comfortable, I think it is a little harder than the others on purpose, so you dont just dose off in the middle of a drive. And importantly, if you have kids, the backseat is big enough to stretch out in.

Style. 
-a. Interior. The interior of the car is very smooth looking, and thought out. Everything matches, and in our car, the dark gray reminds you of a cold winter morning. Everything fits together nicely, and nothing is jutting out.
-b. Exterior. The Cirrus has a very stylish. Our car is Dark Green, with silver letters on the side that say "Chrysler", this makes your car look like a million bucks, even if it didnt cost that much.
