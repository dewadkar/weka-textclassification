            Overall, I'm mostly pleased with my Ricoh RDC-4300. I bought the camera because of its amazing wealth of features and included accessories and software, all for a very nice price. 

The camera's resolution is excellent, and I've taken some really stunning pictures with it. You can see some of my pictures at http://wonko.com/images/pix/sunset2/ . However, despite the excellent photo quality, this camera does have a few shortcomings. The biggest annoyance is the time it takes for the camera to actually snap a picture. The camera sometimes takes as long as a second to respond after you press the button, and then the screen blanks out for several seconds while the image is written to memory. This is definitely not a good camera for action shots or spur-of-the-moment type things. <br><br>
