            At the time I bought this, Fujifilm introduced this as the &quot;World's Highest Resolution (1.5 Million Pixel) Camera&quot;.  Having own this camera for that long I am still pleased with the durability from Fujifilm.  I don't use this camera as much as I like but I am as happy with the quality and functionality this camera have given me.

The camera comes with software for editing your pictures.  I found the program to be very useful if you are interested in photo editing.  It also came with a serial cable for file transfer from your camera to your computer.  However I bought the optional flashpath adapter, which in my opinion is a must have!  I have since purchased another memory card (8MB) which in my opinion this is needed (2MB included).

The camera is extremely user friendly and it did not take me that long to understand its features.  One note, I have not used the manual mode that much.  There are just too many options for me to use.  Automatic Mode works for me.  The pictures in 1.5 Million pixels are great if you are not too picky.  However Fuji currently have cameras with 4.3 Million Pixels (Yikes!).  If I upgrade my digital camera maybe, I'll look at the 40i but honestly I have no complaints for this trusty camera.  If any potential buyers are looking for a great quality camera with dependability and a great price.  I would recommend looking on ebay or any electronics store with old stock.

I would recommend this camera to anyone though I wished I waited a little longer.  There seems to be quite frequent new level of standards for digital cameras.  By this time next year, I would not be surprised if the pixel count will be at 6 million.<br><br>
