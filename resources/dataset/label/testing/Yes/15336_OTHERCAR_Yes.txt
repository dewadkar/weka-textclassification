            Well, I shopped for digital cameras for a while before choosing this one.  I wanted a mid-range camera ($400-$700)with good picture quality and MPEG capabilities.  I figured that since I would be using primarily for family pictures, the MPEG feature was something that I really wanted.  It is great being able to capture a 5 or 15 second clip of an activity (versus a digital picture)...if a picture is worth 1000 words, I wonder what a 15 second MPEG is worth???

I also like the floppy disk storage media.  It definitely makes transferring the pictures to a computer a piece of cake.  Plus, its nice when I visit relatives (or friends), take some pictures, and then just hand them the disk.  People love it, and it beats the promise of e-mailing it to them at a later date.

The camera itself handles very nicely.  The user interface is a snap to learn and the little control mouse/button works very nicely.  I like the 3x optical zoom, but sometimes I wish I had paid the extra $200 for the md88 with the better zoom.  I'm also finally used to the LCD display.  This is the one flaw of the camera.  I've used other digital cameras, and its a great battery saver plus a lot more intuitive.  The one good thing about the LCD is the sunlight readability.  You have to be sure to tilt the camera right, but the top light catcher works great (in daylight, I never turn the backlights on!)

Some of the photography features are nice.  These include the flash and aperture controls.  The macro capabilities are nice for taking close pictures of small objects, and I've used the self-timer often and with great results (even in MPEG mode!!!).  The &quot;picture effect&quot; key is useless in my mind, since even the most basic picture editing programs can do the same...but if you like to see the world in Black and White then you might like that feature.  The last photography item is the delay between the shutter and the picture.  It is almost 1 full second.  This doesn't matter when taking stills, but if you are trying to catch action, this can throw you off.

Overall, I love this camera.  I take it everywhere with me (since I never run out of film...)  I did invest in the upgraded battery (the F-550) which gives me a good 2 hours of camera time, which is very good, especially since there is no AC Adapter.  I also took one of my wife's old pocket books and turned it into my camera bag, but if I hadn't found that, the Sony bag would be a good idea.  The price of this camera should be dropping soon (I've seen if for under $600 recently.)  If you are looking for a good all-around digital camera that can (a)give you great computer pictures, for e-mail and local storage (b)give great pictures for color printing....(although you do sacrifice disk space here) and (c)give you MPEGs for great memories and business clips, this is a great and economical camera.  (If you have the dough...you should spring for the 88 instead)

Well, good luck with your photography, and I hope this helps.  If you have any questions feel free to send me an e-mail...   Later<br><br>
