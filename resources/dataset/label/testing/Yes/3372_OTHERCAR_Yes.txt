            Finally, I had the opportunity to test drive the new 2001 Pathfinder. I was so excited and was willing to trade in my 97 path even before driving the new model. With 70 horsepower more than what I have and bigger 3.5 engine and the new body design, you can't go wrong. I drove the new Path for about 15 minutes and I was not impressed at all with the new engine, it still noisy and you can't tell the difference between the 170hp and 240hp, interior is basically the same as my old 97. I felt that I was still driving my old car, everything felt the same except the newer smell.
the pathfinder overall is a great truck and I highly recommend it, but don't expect a dramatic improvement in engine performance than older model. 
Remember, this is a new engine, I suggest you wait for the professional reviews and recall information before you buy or trade.
