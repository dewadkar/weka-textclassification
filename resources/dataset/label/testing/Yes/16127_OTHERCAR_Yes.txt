            I bought this Jeep used from a personal seller. I liked the style of the Jeep and the roominess of it. It is a 1988 and had 100,000 miles on it when I bought it. I got it for a great price and drove it for many months.  I drove it to eastern Oregon alot and to Klamath Falls and Me and my husband took it reno and middle nevada.  Well we got back from Nevada and it started making funny noises.  Well I had a mechanic look at it and he said the barrings were going out and that alot of other things were wrong. I had only put 10,000 more miles on it.  It shouldn't be doing that at that mileage. Jeeps are made to  last alot longer than that. I love the style. The reason I bought it was because I do travel on long trips with my daughter and husband and little sister. I like the fact that it is a great travel vechicle and great for off road trips too. But I need a vechicle that is dependable and not going to break down when I am out in the middle of somewhere. I hope you think about it before buying it.
