            I purchased a 1993 Dodge Intrepid used in 1998 from a local small time car dealership located in Kansas City, Kansas. During the time in my possession I have concluded that this is a grand automobile.
  My Intrepid is an ES model with full electric everything, and the top of the line Infiniti stereo system installed by Dodge.
The car also was loaded with all leather seating, talk about cool!
  When I purchased the Intrepid, I did so for the good graces of my wife who wanted a four door vehicle to ease the loading &amp; unloading of our kids. I then began having those infinite married with children thoughts.
  &quot; Great, a family car; I am surely domesticated now &lt;sigh&gt; &quot;.
But boy was I wrong, the Intrepid is a great car for single or married folks. This car handles the road like a precision racing car.
  In the two years time that we have had the auto ( other than normal scheduled oil changes ) the car has only needed service one time.
A control arm sensor and another type sensor needed to be replaced.
  There is only one thing that I can really find to gripe about, and that is the front end paint job done by Dodge. You see this year &amp; model Intrepid has a partial plastic front end scoop area.
  When road grit,etc strikes the front partition the paint chips off exposing the ugly green plastic under color. Now normally green is my favorite color, just not when the rest of my car is white.
  I recommend this car to just about everybody who would like to have an auto somewhere between mid size rug rat carrier to luxury vehicle.
Because basically put, that sums up this grand vehicle called Intrepid.<br><br>
