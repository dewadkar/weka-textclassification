            Why did I buy this car?  Why not!?!  It had everything I wanted for the price I wanted to pay.  After I had seen the commercial for the new Jetta, I owned one two weeks later.  The new style was a major improvement to the car, it was much more classier looking.

I love my car because it is manual transmission, which I had no idea how todrive before I purchased this car.  It makes driving alot more fun.  I love my car because it makes me smile every morning when I get into it, just knowing that this is my car.

Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase of my Jetta, but there are two things I would change.  The glove box is too small, I can only fit my owner's manual and a tire pressure gauge in it.  The high beam switch you push out instead of in, which sometimes when I use my turn signals I find myself accidentaly turning on my high beams.

This car could be driven by all age's.  It is a very solid car, with a very reasonable price.  For anyone in the Lehigh Valley I suggest to purchase your car from Young Volkswagen, those guys are great! <br><br>
