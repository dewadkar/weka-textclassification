            I recently traded my 1998 Cadillac DeVille Concours on a 2001 Deville DTS.  But before I did, I did a little shopping.  Just for comparison purposes.  I went to my local Mercedes-Benz dealer and test drove the 2001 Mercedes E320, price-wise, the Cadillac equivalent.  Nice car, with all the electronic technology.  The six cylinder standard engine provided decent pickup but not what I was used to in my Cadillac.  Interior room was sufficient but not much room in the rear seat.  I asked the salesperson to open the trunk and was taken aback.  Maybe one large suitcase and one set of golf clubs.  I had seen enough.  Not a lot for a car that stickered in the high 50's.

I ordered my new DTS and the day I picked it up was greatly anticipated.  I was not disappointed.  What a beautiful automobile.  Black and black.  Wood trim through out and all leather.  The DTS has a full console with the gearshift in a very convenient shifting location.  The salesperson got in the car with me and we spent about an hour going over all the programable settings and activating the OnStar system (now a standard item).  New this year is a power steering wheel, which moves up and down and telescopes.  The seats are as comfortable as my Lazy Boy chair.  With lumbar support AND a massage feature, it makes long trips a breeze.  Of course, all positions for seats, mirrors, etc are programed to a personal fit.  Sometimes I just sit in the car for a back massage!

Rear seat head and leg room is superb.  There is heating and AC controls for the rear passengers to be as comfortable as they like.  For safety, there are rear passanger airbags.  The trunk is ample (remember the Mercedes?) and there is plenty of room for luggage and golf clubs.  The DTS is equipped with an 8 speaker Bose sound system and the CD changer is located in the glove box.  Very convenient for changing them out.  The sound is tremendous.

Underway is when the DTS comes into it's own.  With the tweaked up 32 valve NorthStar V-8 (300 hp, that produces a nice growling sound when accelerated), the sheer joy of driving begins.  With Stabili-Trac and the computer sensors telling the car the road surface conditions, steering and road holding ability is rock solid.  Curves and turns on the same road I take every day in my company that I must slow down for, I blow through in the DTS without one suggestion of roll or instability.  Acceleration is awesome.  When the pedal hits the floor, hang on.  If you aren't used to this kind of power, it is easy to run up on other cars.  Watch your speed.  90 mph happens without realizing it.

I am sorry to say to fans of the German and Japanese luxury vehicles, Cadillac gives you more in every category for a whole lot less money.  Seems folks buy the name Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, etc.  Are you getting more car?  Drive a 2001 Cadillac DTS and you will have your answer.
