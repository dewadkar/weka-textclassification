            Today I will be talking about a good hard working car but it was a used car and it gave me and my wife a real hard time.  I will not put the blame on the car but on the people who use the car and the service looking after the car.


I don't believe in brands, I think all cars are good as long as you treat them good, of course there are some options which some brands get credit over others but then again, my statement still applies.

Before you buy a car, you have to be honest with yourself, answer these questions, please and thank you.
1- Which way will I buy the car, cash or lease?
2-Does it have to be new, or used one will do?
3- Did I put in mind that there is a lot of hidden costs that weren't noticed?
i.e a) parts b) labour c) tax  d) insurance e) depreciation value...etc

a) Well talking about parts, that all depends on what brand you are buying, is it American brand or European brand. American brands have not so expensive parts comparing to the imported European brands (putting in mind that we are not talking about the fancy cars)

 b) Labour is effected also with the brand, the more fancy the brand the more you will be expected to pay.

c) Tax, well you know the more you pay for your car and parts and labour, the more you will pay the government, (from one point of view it's ok, the government fixes the road and puts lights on the street and they pay a lot ) but then again why should you pay more when you can pay less? Simply because you want to go fancy ( it's ok if you are making good money and working hard, I think its fair ).

d) Insurance, woo that's a nice hidden cost, and many people fall for it. Why? Because they think it's not a must ( it's a must now by law), or  they never bother to ask how much they will be paying with that fancy brand, like I said if you work hard, its ok by me, enjoy your life but the question is do you really have to give away that kind of money? When you could save it for something else, by buying a nice moderate brand. Well final word, it's a free country and it's your money and you could do whatever you think with it, and no, I don't have any problem with that..............hehehe

e) Depreciation value, well, it's simply the loss of value of an item or a  good due to usage. Did you know that once you buy your new car and start driving, you have lost about 10% of its value on the spot! (maybe more)
Well, it's true and you can check out with your salesman.
 
4- Do I really need that kind of car? e.g fancy or sport looking brand.
I have seen it myself, we, in Egypt, have filthy rich people, and yes, they drive good cars but just ordinary ones, I am not talking about all, because some love being fancy it's the prestige sort of thing. Yes, it has to be a Mercedes and yes, it has to be the same year model. Why? Simply for the same reasons I mentioned and I got no problem with that.....heheh

5- Can I keep up with the other bills while paying for that car ( in case you are leasing). Many people in Egypt prefer buying in cash escaping the interest and headaches..........hehehe

Many people, like me and you, admire things very much and it's like forefilling a dream, they work very hard to make a dream come true and because they are so concentrated on there goal, they miss very important points and then they pay big time for there ignorance, even if it is not intended.

You always have to keep in mind, that the salesman, who are cool guys and trying their best to help you but they are making money and they are trying to sell.  They are very smart at that point, they know which buttons to push,  and let me tell you which button they love to push and many people fall for it.

Ok, let's see how I can put it so you will be able to understand.
Ok, forget about cars for now and let's talk about human nature, we, as human beings, love to own ,and collect and we get proud of ourselves when we own lots of stuff. Take me for example, I used to collect tapes as I love music very much, I have almost 1000 tapes I was collecting since I was 13 years old ( I am now close to 30 years old) and every time a friend visits I would ask him, which kind of music do you like and do you like to listen to any special band?
In a way just to show off and in the same manner to be nice and friendly.

Now, be honest with me, what do you like to collect ?hehehe
Most of us do so, it's not a big deal, there is nothing there to be ashamed of, it's human nature, we just differ from one person to the other in taste and ideas but ignoring the taste and ideas, we are all the same.

Of course for every rule there is exceptions and some people don't like collecting, they are very few in our material life but I believe they also exist! 

Now, back to cars, the salesman know that we love to own, we love options, and while you are buying a new car, he asks you, would you like to have a CD player, what about the sports utilities, what about power windows, or power sunroof, power steering, automatic transmission ...etc

Everytime he asks you these questions, he wants you to say yes, why, simply because he is selling and it's business for him, he is not the one to blame, it's you, the more you want the more you will end up paying, and if you are leasing, wooo, interest my friend is adding up like crazy. You don't notice it because you are happy with the new car and its options but during the 5 or 6 years lease, you will start noticing that most of your money is going towards the car!

Decision making is hard and not all of us are wise when it comes to buying, I learned my lesson the hard way, with the laptop PC, check out my opinion about laptop PC, it's very easy to blow the money in things which are not necessities, now go and make the money back, it's hard, wake up early on Monday and get ready for the job, it's hard, many of us know what I am talking about, so, I just want you to be wise when buying because I wasn't!

Ok back to the used car, I was talking about, it is a 1991 Pontic Sunbird 2.0 Litre, 4 cylinders.

My wife calls it Bessie, actually good old Bessie...........hehehe.
Well, it's not my car but I am sharing my experience with it because it's a hard experience.

little history about the car:-
It's really an old car almost 10 years old, my wife had to rebuilt the motor 3 times and buy 2 brand new motors for old Bessie, also the transmission went twice, so she had to rebuilt it too!

The car in general is a hard working car, we delivered pizza many times with it, driving on non even road, full of rocks and mud and snow.
It does not burn a lot and maybe that's how we made our money out of delivering.

The spare parts are available and not that expensive over here in Canada, you can buy them new from Canadian Tire or used, from junk yards especially when you are looking for an ashtray or the back triangle window, which on the long run will not make a big difference to you, new or old part.

Generally speaking, cars are expensive  (used or new) comparing to the United States of America, I have seen cars in NY in very good shape and very nice cheap price.
(I don't know why car prices here in Canada are on the expensive side, maybe because of the tax, I don't really know!)

My wife paid$ 265.00 Canadian dollars per month for 5 years, which will add up to $15,900 Canadian dollars, that price was for old Bessie as a used car and I bet she paid almost the same on parts and labour and tax.

We had a hard time with Old Bessie when her motor went down, we had to buy a new motor, and the first seller was a very non flexible type of person, let me tell you the story.

Well, the story started when Old Bessie's motor started to knock, and started to make these wired noises, I was always making fun of my wife's car and tell her old bessie is having a bad cold ........hehe
( I love teasing my wife, I don't know why, its just fun....hehehe)

So, we had to travel almost about 4 hours by a van to get that motor for Old Bessie, of course that seller was very friendly and nice in the beginning, he gave us the motor. We asked him if the motor works good, he said ohh yes I tested it. So, we gave him the money and left to go back home before the sunset hit us, you know it's better to travel safe in the daytime.

After we reached home, we contacted our mechanic and he was very happy for us because it took us awhile until we found a nice used motor at a good price. Next day the motor was on and the car was sounding a little bit funny, I thought maybe because the motor is just installed, and the noise will go away by time but I was wrong!

Something was wrong with that motor and we had to call the guy and return the motor back and take our money.
The guy was still friendly and he agreed to take back the motor, so, we were pleased and we planned that we had to sleep early that day as we will travel a long trip, 4 hours going and another 4 hours coming back.

Ohh I forgot to tell you, we had to go to our mechanic on the same day and ask him to take off that motor because we needed to return it back the next day, of course the mechanic did it gladly, he charges for putting the motor as he charges for taking it out.........hehehe sucker.

Anyway, we took the motor with the van and drove all the way to the seller and after that guess what?
The seller refused to give us our money  back because some part was missing for his motor, I offered him to pay for that part, just give us our money back. I told him that we travelled 4 hours and we will have to travel back now just to get you the part, his answer was no, you took the motor, in a condition and you have to return it in the same condition.

I agreed with him, I told him that's right, and I am willing to pay for that part though I am not the mechanic and I did not put the motor or took the motor. Please be reasonable but his answer was still no!
I told him I am ready to go and buy you the same part missing brand new right now, just give us a break and don't let us travel twice.
He said  in his exact words, ( sir, I am losing my temper here, please just go and get the part before I start saying and doing things I really don't want to do!)

I told him there is no need to lose your temper, just listen to me, but he started behaving like, you know..........heheh

At that point, I thought it was not necessary to fight with the guy, I guess we have reached the flash point and anymore talking will only cause trouble. So, I just backed down, and said to myself ok, maybe it's our mistake, I was angry and mad, but I thought to myself, only weak people lose their temper and I will control myself to the car, so, I left the place peacefully.

We had to travel now back 4 hours. The next day we went to the mechanic, I bet he felt dumb about himself but I was nice to the mechanic and I did not blame him, I just asked him in a nice way to get whatever part from the car and please put it with the motor in the van.

The next day, we had to travel again to the mean seller, I just hope you don't ever meet such people in your life.......hehehe
Anyway we gave him the stupid part and the no good motor, we took our money and left. I was nice as much as I could, I told him that we are sorry for the misunderstanding, I just hope we are even now, inside of me I was sure that we were not even, he cost me 2 trips and the four mechanic fees but, at least I just showed him that I am better or maybe he showed me the greedy side of human beings ..........hehehe

Anyway, I don't let that stuff bother me because I will get sick, I believe that life is fair and there is a Great God out there who is watching
and trust me, no matter how long, these type of people pay big time.
I don't have to prove it to you but trust me, they do.
Thank you for reading, I just hope I didn't talk too much .........heheh
