            I have a 91' Chevy S-10 and I have to say it is a great truck. This truck runs very well for having 178,000 miles on it, no that's not a mistake 178,000 miles.

I recently decided that I wanted to purchase a new S-10 and was not surprised at all by the power the lurked under the hood of the little truck. I did however notice that the newer model accelerated and handled a lot better than mine did. With the power of the 4.3L V6 and the stopping power of the four-wheel anti locking brakes the salesperson had a ride that he would not soon forget. I was able to get the truck up to 60mph and stop it in about 150-175 feet which is not too shabby. Believe it or not there are some really curvy roads in Florida, don't ask me why, and it could handle a 20mph curve at a higher speed and there was very limited body roll.

Overall this truck offers a lot in a very small package. But there is a draw back to this truck, its price. Its price loaded is about $18,000 which is about the price of the Dodge Dakota with some comparable options. But it is still worth every penny because it can tow just as much as its competitors and it does it in style.

I really like the way the Extreme looks, if you are looking for a sporty truck you can't miss with the S-10 extreme. Or if you need plenty of power in a small package then the S-10 is the truck for you.<br><br>
