            This camera was purchased for use in business to document real estate holdings and shelters.  I evaluated most of the name brand cameras at a trade show before deciding on this one.  The ease of use and number of pixels was a definite choice on choosing this.  The most important feature I was interested in was the ability to transfer the digital images from the camera to a computer easily.  The other cameras I evaluated all required a data cable to make this transfer.  The Sony MVCFD88 has a standard 1.44Mb floppy drive built right into the camera which makes for easy transfers to any computer.  

I am able to take four high quality pictures on one standard floppy which is good but could be better.  Perhaps in the future Sony will install an LS120 drive into this camera which will allow 120Mb of memory for many pictures on one floppy.  Overall this is the highest quality, easiest to use and unfortunately most expensive camera I have looked at.  As a matter of fact I liked it so much, I bought two of them.<br><br>
