            While shopping for a new car my family decided we needed an SUV with seven seats.  After looking at the models with seven seats we bagged that idea and went looking at the whole SUV market.  We took a look at a Dodge Durango and Ford Explorer but quickly dismissed buying an american car.  Having owned toyota's for a long time we went to look at a 4 runner but they seemed small and impractical.  We went and looked at the Lexus RX 300, it was great there was something to satisfy everyones wants.  Even though space was limited it was all designed practically and passenger room was extremely ample ( I'm 6 ft and my dad is 6&quot; 2&quot;) The usual Lexus luxuries satisfied me with nice leather elegant wood trimmed console with cool looking Trip LCD. The Premium Nakamichi stereo system is great it delivers clean sound at the highest volumes you could imagine.  My mom was satisfied with the safety of driver,passenger and side airbags. Acceleration seems tame but you'll hit sixty before you realize. You sacrifice the initial oomph of acceleration for a smooth rounded curve that provides a very comfortable ride.  The handling is amazing compared with the big trucks and so is the gas mileage (published at 18/22 but you get more) Designed off the ES300 platform it handles almost as well as the car.  In conclusion i love this car its great inside and has the Lexus Image and superior performance.<br><br>
