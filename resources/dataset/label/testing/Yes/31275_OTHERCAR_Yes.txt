            The Tercel is my first car, but anyway I have driven cars of all kinds, colors and brands (my dad�s Subaru Forester and Mercedes 280 CE, my mom's Escort that's being changed for a Corolla, my brother's Chevrolet S-10 pickup, my other brother's Seat Ibiza, my sister�s Kia Sportage, my girlfriend's Hyundai Excel, a friend's Chrysler Neon... I've tried it all) and that's why I love this one. At first, when my mom told me she bought me a Tercel, I wasn't really happy about it, though I thought it was a cheap lame car. But when I first stepped on it's soft and powerful gas pedal, I knew it was different, and I thank mom almost everytime after I lock it's doors for having made such a smart decision.

I'm a college student, I study architecture in Santiago, Chile... and as all the people that share my same interest know, I constantly have to run to every corner of the city because of my scarce time. From home to college, to the library, to my girlfriend's house, to Home Depot, to the mall... I have to be everywhere at the same time handing in models and drawing on the hills of my big city. My Toyota responds to every of my speed desires just with a few pesos of fuel. Jumps perfectly over every pothole (excellent shocks and platform height) and it's perfectly manuverable through our small and crowded streets. And in the highway, it's even better (excellent 3rd gear when making tough moves). It's easy to wash in the inside and outside, economic, fast, agile and above all, reliable... never lets me down. I miss some details like intermitent wipers, trunk lid opener latch from the inside and tachometer (it's an Xli, the base model, so that's my fault), and some better grip in fast curves... but it's halogen headlamps and tailights that come in the 99 model gives it a much more modern and sporty touch than the 98 version.

One of the best things is that it's so lightweighted that it doesn't even need power steering, although when you have more than 2 people onboard you sort of miss those speedy starts when the light goes green. When shifting gears it gets a bit jumpy, and it's shifts are a bit longer than usual... but all it's three pedals work beautifully, specially it's heartstopping brakes.

It's space is perfect for my needs... all my friends love this 4 door version though it's much more roomier and spacious than the 2 door model. I just open one of the rear doors and throw all my architectural utensisls on the rear seat in a sec... and it's remote keyless entry and alarm entry make it much more safe and confortable. Above all, when I start the engine the car locks automatically, and it unlocks the moment I turn it off. Also when i open it with the remote, it's lights stay on for about 15 seconds... just the amount of time I need to get in and start it up, moment in which all the lights go out again. Toyota doesn't miss ANY useful detail; my Tercel has just what I need, nothing more, nothing less. <br><br>
