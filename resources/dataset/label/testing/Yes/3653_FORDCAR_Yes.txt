              I am basically a professional driver, that's all I do. I drive from one place to the next as I am needed. The usual company car for me is the 1999-2000 Ford Crown Victoria.
  Driving the Ford Crown Victoria is a real treat, given the fact that it gives a smooth even ride with great road handling capabilities.
The Ford Crown Victoria has a roomy interior allowing for a relaxed ride.
  With your choice of amneties, either power or manual seats it can seat anyone from large to small comfortably. A real nice feature about these cars is that Ford has began making them with heated exterior mirrors.
  I can't even begin to tell you what a difference that makes when you are driving in a blizzard or despicable driving conditions in the winter months. The Ford Crown Victoria also has nice engine specifications.
  Although for the life of me I don't understand why Ford installs a governor at 110 mph. The car is most obviously slated for up to 140 mph, and could quite easily handle those speeds (with a trained driver ).
  I have driven Ford Crown Victorias for most of my career as a professional driver and can vouch for their sturdiness and reliability.
I say this as I have had the unfortunate distinction of driving through a 
  persons residence (house)backwards.  After my unfortunate crash, the automobile was DRIVEN down the street to an awaiting tow truck with NO major damages to the car, other than a broken out tail light &amp; rear window.
  The Ford Crown Victoria is in my opinion one of the finest automobiles on the road today, even with an engine governor!
( Hey, lighten up about the speed okay?   I was going backwards for goodness sake! )<br><br>
