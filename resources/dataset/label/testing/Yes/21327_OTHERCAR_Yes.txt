            The Camry is, to say nothing else, awesome. The Camry is the most purchased vehicle in the last few years in the United States. Our lasted 15 years before we got another. Amazing how far a good car can take you nowadays, ain't it?
It is an absolute must for a family of 3 to 5. The kids will love it, the parents will appreciate it, both will fight over who gets to drive it next! (Hey! It happens at our house) On occasion, my sister has slept in the car, and had no qualms with it at all. So, I figure this car will give you the best bang for the bucks. <br><br>
