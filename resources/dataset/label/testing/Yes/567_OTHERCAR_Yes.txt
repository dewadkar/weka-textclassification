            Well, this car is my first new car. I've had it for a while and I'm extremely happy with it. As I read other reviews, some people seem to be dissapointed it doesnt have as many features as other cars. I dont think they should compare this to a Mercedes. It doesnt have everything, but for the price and the warranty it is well worth it. This is the perfect car for a college student. I was planning on buying a used car but when I read about the warranty, it was too much to pass up. I've had it for a year now, and I havent had any problems with it. The warranty is for 10 years so I wont have to worry much about it and for a first time car buyer, that's a great thing.

I once had a flat tire, and within 20 minutes a guy came and changed it for me for free. This is one of the many bonuses you get when you buy this car. It's not a Ferrarri but if you want a nice looking car to not worry about, this is it. Mine is green, 4 door, stick shift ( i hate driving automatics) and it also came with nice alloy rims. The interior design is the only thing I can really complain about..... it's not great looking. There isnt much else to say about it. I've had it for 1 year and I've never had any problems with it. It's a nice car and doesnt cost that much. All I can say is, if your looking for a car with many extra features, this isnt' for you. But, if you want a very affordable car that is in good shape and reliable with a good warranty, this is it. If I had a son and were to buy him a new car, this is what I would get him. I wouldnt have to worry much about it breaking down or about it affecting my pocketbook.
