            I got my Achieva used and I paid a little over $11000.00 
to say the least I wasn't to happy until I took it for a test drive around the block. I noticed the power of the 3.1V6 with a little under 200 hp the car had under the hood. Before I finished the drive I knew I wanted this car. The Achieva performs wonderfully, it's very comfortable not to mention it's wonderful handling.

The passing gear kicks out around 90 - 95 mph, oh well it's still a great car.

The only work I've ever had done was: The brake pads routers, struts, the belt, new brakes, tires. I'm always getting the oil changed 1000 miles before it's needed, usual maintenance you should always take care of.

&quot;Achieva SL&quot; came with daytime running lights for safety, power door locks, windows, anti-lock brakes, cruse control, rear defrost and window locks, Anitlock brakes, what I really love is the &quot;traction control&quot; I use this all the time. LOVE THE Ahcieva!!

I can't think of one bad thing to say about the Achieva, other then I want to get RamAir installed to increase the HP.
