            I bought this camera to take pictures of really tiny objects such as jewelry for my website.  It was complete luck that I ran into this little one, because I knew absolutely nothing about digital cameras, but this was  $400 well spent. The clarity of the image is excellent, macro mode is a real asset because it clears up the object even more, especially when you are close.  I took a picture of a diamond ring and the diamond just sparkles, you see the clarity in the diamond and the shimmer of the gold.  The 6x precision digital zoom is also an excellent feature, which aids me in getting the perfect shot. 

I not only use this camera for business , but I get great shots of my family and friends also.  It takes great pictures in the worst conditions.  Example: I have horrible light in my kitchen, but the shot came out clear as crystal and bright.  It was like I had tons of light was shinning through the window.  The 1.5 lcd  is a dream, I can preview the shots and just delete them if I don't like them.  I love this little camera, it is great for any situation.

The camera was easy to set up, the software is self explanatory.  I had it set up in a few minutes. The actual program is also very easy to use, you do not have to be an expert to use it.  You can clear up your picture, brighten, add color, delete color, make calendars, postcards, and much more.  Your options are numerous with this great little camera and easy to use program. 

I found that this camera was very expensive at many stores up to $600, but I found it at brandsmart USA for the low price of $399. I was lucky I got a great camera at a great price and you can too.
