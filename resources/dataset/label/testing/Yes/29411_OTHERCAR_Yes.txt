                Finally a Porsche that we can not only dream of driving......we can afford to as well.  Well,  not me as of yet, but i plan to purchase one.  I've been working at a upscale hotel in beatiful Santa Monica,California as a parking attendant part time for some extra cash.  As a perk,  i get to drive many very beautiful cars.  This is fine with me, as i get to earn some extra cash and test out a few cars.   
      I've driven quite a few Porsche Boxters.  This seems to be a car of choice among middle aged (upper-class)men,that can't yet afford the carrera.......along with the pricey alimony payments.  I'll tell you what though,  if you are young, and can afford it.....this is\the car for you.  
       First of all, it looks great.  Porsche spared no expense in the design of this car.  Its sporty, classic, exotic, and last but not least, solid. 
       I'm sure most of you know the spec's on the boxter, so i'll spare you the technical mumbo jumbo and give you advice based on my experience with the Boxter.  Ok, don't get the 4 cylinder unless you absolutely can't afford the 6.  The 4 cylinder has pep, don't get me wrong, but if you are going to get the Boxter go ahead and get the 6 cylinder with the sports package, turbo and all that.  You'll get the tiptronic 6 speed transmission and you won't be dissapointed.  You're most likely going to have to wait for your Boxter when you purchase it, and i wouldn't be suprised if you have to pay a little over sticker.  So spend the extra few thousand and get all the extras, trust me. 
       Another way to go is with a slightly used Boxter.  They're popping up here and there.  You can find a very slightly used, low mileage, practically brand new boxter at around 35-40k.  You'll save some major cash and still be completely satisfied.   It seems that a lot of boxters end up sitting in a garage, only being driven on Sundays until the owner finds a new toys and sells the Boxter at a steal.  Cash in on this! 
        So to wrap this lil' &quot;Epinion&quot; up,  if you're thinking about purchasing a Boxter, I'd strongly recommend doing so.  You can NOT beat the performance, styling, and value of this vehicle.   I know you may consider going with the Audi TT, it is a little cheaper and i love that car as well, but there is no comparison in performance.   get the boxter.
