            I bought my wonderful 1995 Ford Escort Wagon because my old reliable Toyota was on it's last legs.  I decided to go for a domestic car this time because of the cost to fix my Toyota when it did break down.

I love the way the wagon drives.  I do alot of city and highway driving and I find it comfortable in all areas.  The really long distance drives - more than 300 miles at a pop - I really would prefer something more luxurious but I realize my payments would be quite a bit more.

This type of car is great for young families, single people who do a lot of hauling, and older people who do a lot of hauling too.  I have a neighbor couple I talk to often and they are in their 70s and from what they say about there wagon and the ease in hauling items - I don't think they'd ever switch to anything else.  I also get about 25 to 30 miles per gallon in gas mileage and this is a big plus lately.

My wagon is zippy, but sometimes on the road I get passed by cars with bigger engines.  Anyone who prefers something with a lot of power shouldn't purchase an Escort Wagon, at least not one that is 5 years old, like mine.  

Overall I love my wagon.  It's convenient and fits a young family lifestyle.<br><br>
