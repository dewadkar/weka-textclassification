            The Fuji FinePix 2400 Zoom is a very impressive 2.1 MegaPixel camera with 3X Optical Zoom. Images captured are nice and clear with good white balance and colour, all in a compact design. Very easy to use, just point and shoot.
There are 3 image sizes available with various compression settings, 
1600x1200 Fine (1/5), Normal (1/10), Basic (1/20),
1280x960 Fine (1/4), Normal (1/8) and
640x480 Normal (1/8).
Although there is no TIFF (uncompressed) option, the JPEG compression at the highest quality is quite low for Digital Cameras.

Selecting Manual mode allows you to adjust the Exposure compensation and White balance (seven settings available). The 10 second self-timer is curiously not available when shooting in Manual mode.
On the minus side the 1.6&quot; LCD screen is small and difficult to use at times.

Overall a great camera, which takes excellent pictures outdoors and indoors, good Macro capability, low battery usage and for the price, a bargain. <br><br>
