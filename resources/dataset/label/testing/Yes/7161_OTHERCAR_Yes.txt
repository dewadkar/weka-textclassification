                I bought the 1999 Dodge Caravan new during the summer of 1999, and our experience with this van has been very positive for the most part. It has stood up for the last year under the onslaught of our two kids, aged 13
and 4.
    We opted for the less expensive base model Caravan, so our van does not have left and right cargo doors - it has only one, on the right side. However, we have not found this to be any problem, as it is one less door that we have to worry about the 4-year-old opening while driving.
    After a year of driving, we have accumulated about 17,000 miles, and there are no creaking or rattles from the vehicle. However, there is a coin holder in the ashtray area of the dash, and coins stored there tend to rattle a bit. 
    Our van has the smaller of the 4-cylinder engines, but it seems quite peppy for a small engine considering the weight of the van with all four of us on board (my 13-year-old is as tall as me and weighs 180 pounds, and I weigh 225 pounds. The 4-year-old only weighs 40 pounds, and Cindy won't tell me what she weighs, but I figure it's around 125 pounds). We have not had a moment's problem with the engine or drive train.
   One thing that does bug me about the 1999 Dodge Caravan is the glove box located on either side of the back seat, and on the left side on the middle seat. My 4-year-old loves to open it, and being spring-loaded, it will slam shut with quite a smack! It will scare the bejeebers out of you if everything is quiet and you are lost in your driving. I've been threatening to glue them shut, but Cindy won't let me.
   The only warranty work needed was to fix the rear latch that would stick on occasion. Turns out that it was never greased, and a quick blob of grease solved the problem.
   My van gets about 32 mpg on the highway, and about 25 mpg in the city.
I am pleased with the gas mileage, as I rarely drive under 70mph on the freeway.
   Concerning the windshield: it is very large , and very expensive to replace. However, it is installed at a very sloping angle, and rocks seem to deflect off of it without doing much damage. And, I can tell you that I have not just been lucky with my windshield - I own a large glass company, and I have had 5 Dodge Caravan windshields in stock for well over a year, and haven't sold one during the past year. I see Dodge Caravans everywhere; that's why I stocked up on windshields for them. In the last few years since the newer style Dodge Caravan has been on the market, I would say I have installed less than one windshield per year in Dodge Caravans. Personally, I hate the fact that the Caravan's windshield is so rarely broken, but you will love it!
   The ride is very comfortable for a van, but Dodge's have always been known for a good ride. The Caravan has very low noise levels, and conversation can take place without yelling. 
   The middle and rear seats are very easy to remove - just a quick grab and turn of the handles on the bottom rear of each seat, and they roll (yes, they have wheels!) right out the back door. Sometimes I will remove the middle, smaller seat, and roll the large back seat to the middle position (they will interchange). This way, we have more room to store ice chests and camping gear when we go to the State Park. However, since the boys fight like cats and dogs, we put the 13-year-old in the front passenger seat, and Mom rides in the back with the 4-year-old.
   I would recommend the Dodge Caravan to anyone with two or more kids. It
is a lot of car for the money. Our base model, which did come with a great air conditioner and AM/FM radio (no CD or cassette, however), cost $16,700. We added a receiver trailer hitch ($189 with installation and wiring), and will be adding tinting film to the glass.
   This van is as well made as any foreign competitor's mini-van, and is rated very high for safety. It has a lot of visibility, and my 5-foot tall wife has no problem seeing over the steering wheel. I am 5' 9&quot; , and I have lots of head room. I would venture that a six-foot person would not feel cramped while driving. Lots of leg room front and rear, lots of cargo room, especially when you remove the seats.
  I especially like the little gizmos made into the back of the rear seat, which allows you to hang your plastic grocery bags of groceries, and prevents your can goods and oranges from rolling all over the place. Very well thought out!<br><br>
