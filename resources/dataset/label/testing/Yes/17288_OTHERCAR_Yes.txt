                 For anyone that has read my review on my 1992 Bonneville SE, you may remember that my main complaint about that car was that it was too slow.  Otherwise, I loved it.  That car had 185 horse-power.  This one has 240.  A very noticeable improvement.
     I bought my 1996 SSEi just under two years ago -- at the beginning of February in South Dakota.  Not the obvious time to buy a sports sedan.  But the 4-wheel ABS and traction-control system make it a very good winter car.  It won't out-do a 4-wheel drive truck, but I often drove through spots that other sedan drivers simply couldn't or wouldn't go.
     My car is loaded with what I believe is every single factory option except the heated side mirrors, but since it was bought in Texas, I guess that makes sense.  I'm one of those people who like to have toys and amenities in my vehicles, and my SSEi doesn't dissapoint.  I have 18-way power leather seats with a love-it or hate-it control system (I personally love it as it's more precise than the older and newer systems are), a good-sounding factory CD/stereo with steering-wheel controls, and a set-it-and-forget it climate control system.  Then you add in the super-charged V6 with a 0-60 time of 7.5 seconds.  Not bad for a 4680 pound 4-door sedan!  What makes it even more fun is all of those little import-tuner cars around town that I pass on a regular basis, much to their disbelief.
     I also have the sliding moon roof, leather seats, variable transmission and ride control and my own personal favorite, the Heads-Up Display.  While not as advanced as the newer Bonnie's and Caddie's out there, my HUD displays my speed and several key indicators up on the windshield so I never have to take my eyes off of the road to see how fast I'm going.
     I have had a couple of people comment that the car looks like the dashboard of the space shuttle with all of it's options, but I found it instantly to my liking.  Everything is where it's supposed to be, and is all easily reachable.
     Having owned this car for almost two years, she has been in the shop several times, but I figure it's not much more than any other car with 103,000 miles on it.  More than 30,000 of which I've personally put on it in that short amount of time.  She has made several cross-country trips with nary a complaint and is driven daily.
     All of the repairs I've had to make were things that I would consider normal wear-and-tear for a car of it's age and usage, but one thing I was not prepared for was the cost of the parts for this car.  Everything for the SSEi is bigger and stronger, therefore harder and more expensive to fix than it's less-powered kin.  To anyone interested in buying one, I highly suggest giving it a thorough going-over with a mechanic and actually checking out the prices for that specific year/model.  I knew Bonneville's from my previous car (now my sister's), but the part and repair costs are nearly double for some parts -- like the variable suspension.
     The only real annoying thing I've experienced with the car was mentioned in an earlier review -- the oil light will come on when oil pressure and amount are fine.  I have learned through several mechanics that this is a common problem with Bonnevilles that most of them believe should have been recalled as it requires replacement of the main dashboard cluster to fix it -- a $700 repair.  As seems to be the norm with other owners I know, I just ignore the light and pay attention to the oil pressure gauge.
     Oh, and to other Bonneville owners who are tired of that center console mess-waiting-to-happen cup holder, a pair of wire cutters will cut it out just fine, making it much easier to use the storage bin under it.
