            I love my car. It's a 1977 Lincoln Continental. I know, you're going to think that's just too old to love, but it's not. 

My old beauty is dark maroon with silver trim. When I first drove that car, I was pregnant and homeless, and my mother bought it for me for only $1500.00, from a buddy at work. It was his mothers' car but she never drove it, just kept it in the garage! 

It felt so good and solid on the ground, and I never yet have felt a rock or bump in the road. Ok, so it is a bit of a gas hog, but I wouldn't sell it for the world! I feel that my children and I are much safer in it than even some of the new trucks out there today. With it's low clearance, it's classy and stable. My husbands friends are always yelling," Hey! Mick Jaggers' here!" when I take him to work!

 I think sometimes things were built better, even though not more economically, in the seventies. Or, maybe, I'm just into heavy steel! Perhaps you should give the used car lot another try!
Slante!
