            I bought my 1994 Acura Integra GS-R 4-door sedan because it had everything I was looking for at the time - performance, comfort, economy, and reliability.  I'm driving the same car more than 6 years and 96,000 miles later because all those factors are still there.  As much as there's nothing like a new car, I don't see much out there that I'd call an upgrade.

Performance.  The engine is excellent.  1.8l, 4-cylinder, 16-valve, DOHC and VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control).  It makes 170bhp @ 7600 RPM, 128 lbs-ft torque @ 6200 RPM, and redline is 8100 RPM.  It's a good idea to keep the RPMs high if you want to drive spiritedly because of the low torque.  It pulls hard once you get to about 4500 RPM, the point where the variable valve timing kicks in; it feels a bit like a car with a turbocharger.  Few things sound as sweet as this engine at redline.  The 5-speed transmission is as smooth as any I've tried.  The Honda double-wishbone suspension provides great handling.

Comfort.  The manual front seats are supportive and easy to adjust, and my 6'3&quot; frame fits nicely.  The back seats are not spacious, but are adequate for kids, small adults, and packages.  The controls are right where you expect them to be.  The only oddities are the counter-intuitive sunroof switch, and the headlight dimmer switch; both simply take some getting used to.  The cruise control also is a little vague when setting the speed.  These are nit-picks, though; it's a quite comfortable car for its size.

Economy.  31.5 MPG overall for the past 6+ years, despite plenty of aggressive driving.  All-highway commuting gets me up to 36 MPG.  This far exceeded my expectations, and has remained steady over the years.  Dealer service is expensive, to be sure, but I do most routine maintenance myself for the cost of parts.  One note: the oil filter is rather difficult to access; I put the car on jacks or ramps to change the oil.  Some dealer service is a good idea for complex items like valve adjustments and timing belt changes.

Reliability.  No recalls, no unscheduled breakdowns, and nothing but normal wear and tear.  This is outstanding, especially considering that 1994 was the first model year of a redesign of the Integra, and the GS-R engine was new that year.  This is Honda reliability, as expected.

There are probably few of these cars with the stock Michelin XGT-V4 M+S all-weather tires left.  That's a good thing; the stock tires are mediocre at best.  They squeal at the slightest provocation, are only fair in the snow and on dry pavement, and are almost dangerous in the rain.  I was never more pleased than when I upgraded to Bridgestone Blizzaks for the winter and Dunlop SP8000s for the rest of the year.  Having the right tires made a big difference.

This car should have a wide audience; it's practical enough for most small families, comfortable enough to be a commuter vehicle, and it's sporty enough to have some fun in.  Its best feature is how much fun it is to drive.  If you're thinking about buying this car, make sure you test it out to redline; it's a totally different car out there.<br><br>
