     I was looking for a new automobile to replace my old car. It had to meet three requirement: excellent drive, adequate power, and reasonable price. It was difficult to find a car to fit all three. Eventually I raised my budget and came to decide between the new 99.5 Audi A4 Quattro and the new 99 BMW 323i.  After three months of shopping and research, I purchased a BMW 323i.

     The new E46 chassis is rock solid and with the new generation, all 3's come with standard 6-cylinder engines (2.5L and 2.8L). This is an improvement over the dismally underpowered 318 and older 323s. The car's performance is excellent coupled with a smooth 5-speed clutch which is as smooth as any out there that I have tried. The car's ride is also very smooth though softer than earlier models, but the road feel is still excellent. The handling and cornering limits were a little less than expected. The acceleration is quick and smooth. The interior is uncharacteristically quiet for a 3-series - almost silent at a complete stop. The interior styling is more in line with the 5 and 7 series - very simple, clean, intelligent, and luxurious. This car combines engine power, suspension, handling, and clutch into such a seemless package that it is a joy to drive - no particular attribute sticks out, everything runs well. All in all, for the price of $30,000 it is an all-around performance/luxury/practical auto - and a great value despite the list base of $26,000 which shoots up with any options added. It is annoying that flip-down seats are an option and that you can only get the nicer wheels and/or cruise control with one of several $2000+ option package. 

     So why the 323 vs. the 328? A dealer told me, &quot;the 328 costs much more for the same car as the 323 except with 20 more horsepower which accellerate the car 0.1 seconds faster. You'd get the 328 to show people you bought a 3 but had money to burn.&quot;
     And why the new 3? When shopping, around a mechanic told me. &quot;I have not been impressed with the older 3 series as there was not the attention to detail and construction as in the larger BMW's. The new 3 changes all that. It is a worthy BMW.&quot; Time will have to prove that to me.

     As with most BMW's, the finer qualities of the car are lost on those who do not care about driving and purchase based on prestige; however, this car provides a lot for its price when evaluted for its technical merits and is fairly reasonable in price when compared in its class.

     I highly recommend it for any driving enthusiast on a limited budget who needs practical transportation. Keep an eye out for the 3-series coupe/convertible and the most likely impressive E46 M3.
