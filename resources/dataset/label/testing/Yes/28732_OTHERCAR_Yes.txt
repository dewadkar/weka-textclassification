            I will be the first to admit, I own a Dodge Avenger, a DSM powered car. It uses the same engine as the 2gNT Eclipses. I love my car fully. However I dont believe what Mitsubishi has done to the Avenger's sister car, the Eclipse.
   My brother owns a 92 Eclipse GSX. For those who do not know what those are, it is an all wheel drive, turbocharged, 4 cyl wonder. The 92 GSX has wonderful handling, a 60mm throttle body for alot if air, and a wonderful turbocharger that gives it the most get up and go that I have ever seen in a 4 banger. Its main drawback is its cramped. Forget about the back seat unless your 4 foot tall.
   Now, I am not sure what Mitsubishi was thinking when they released the second gen machines. They cut back on the HP, made the throttle body opening 52mm to restrict the air input, among other things. The interior is just as cramped as well. The only difference is the exterior is alot nicer than the 1st gens. Little more sleak and eye catching.
   I have driven both the 1st gen and 2gNT's and turbos. They drive nice but the 1st gens still feel more powerful and funner to drive. Also both lat least look good.
   This brings me to the new 2000 Eclipses. I only have one question. WHAT WAS MITSUBISHI THINKING? They made the thing look like a Pontiac Grand Am/Grand Prix! On top of that I have yet to see a 4 wheel drive model or turboed car!! Thats what made these cars so appealing! Why remove the 2 things that make it one of the ideal car to drive???? I have yet to drive one but as of this time it looks like I wouldnt want to even try due to the fact it may ruin my opinion of them period! I hope Mitsubishi will go back to its old ways and realize what car driving fun is. Power, control, comfort, speed. If they do this, they will have a superior car once again.
