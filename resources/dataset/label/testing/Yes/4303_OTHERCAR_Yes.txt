            I love the new beetle. I've been infatuated with them ever since they came out. This past May my dad bought me a new '99, Black, GLS with a moon-roof. I love my car. I get attention everywhere I go, especially from little kids. Theres a couple things that I feel need improved. One would be the cup holders. In the front, they only fit cans, no cups, mugs, big gulps, or what not. Also, my sunroof makes an ear popping noise when the other windows aren't open. Finally, it lacks acceleration. I've broken mine in pretty good, and it still is rather slow from a dead stop. One thing that impressed me was it's ability to perform perfectly under bad weather. The other day I was driving in a foot of deep water, it was pouring rain, and it didn't hydroplane, and my engine didn't flood. This car is as weather proof as a tank, and its as heavy as one too. I love the safety features, such as ABS, front and side air bags around the entire car, the crumple resistant body, and the anti-roll feature. There may be a few cons, but overall this car is a Volkswagen masterpiece. I love my Beetle, and wouldn't trade it for the world.

(My Beetle cost so much because of the moon-roof, alloy wheels, GLS option and c.d. player)<br><br>
