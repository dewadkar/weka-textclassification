            The sony dscs50 cybershot digital camera is a much improved design on the mavica series, while giving high resolution and delivering a compact stylish case. the resoulution is good for web pages, home photos transfer, and comes with good editing resources. The other advantage is the easy storage on the memory stick and of course the adaptors make it easy to insert as a floppy into your pc. to summarise the advantages are:

i would reccomend this camera to anyone who's starting out with digital cameras and wants a easy to use,stylish, camera which yields above average resoultion pics by digital camera standards. This concludes my review.
