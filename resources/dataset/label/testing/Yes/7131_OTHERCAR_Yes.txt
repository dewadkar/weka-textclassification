            We bought our Chevy S-10 extended cab a year ago.  We traded in the truck we had because the payments were too expensive.  We were going to have a baby, and we wanted a good vehicle.  The S-10 is a good reliable truck, but it is not for a family with a baby.  We still have our S-10, but are looking to get rid of it.  Not because it is a bad truck, but it is too small for a family.  

The S-10 is a good built small truck.  It has a V-6 engine, and it gets really great gas mileage.  It has a great stereo system in it, which was a plus for us.  The S-10 rides very comfortable too.  It would make a great truck for just about anyone.
