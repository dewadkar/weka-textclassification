             I purchased a PDC-700 camera at a clearance sale 8 months ago for $99. It came with some accessories such as a case, three cables(USB,Serial,TV-Out), AC Adapter, and all software. 

 First I must say that I was not looking for a high price, high resolution camera. I wanted something I could take some auction photos and fun shots with. The sub $100 cameras at the time were not up to my standards, but this one which listed at $249 was.

 It's easy to install, and with USB and TV-out easy to hook up and transfer photos. A compactflash slot allows for expandibility of picture capacity.

 The quality of the photos is about what you would expect for a 1 megapixel camera(even though it has 764k pixels), sharp enough to put full size 1024x768 on your screen, but not incredibly sharp when printed out. Forget about enlargements with this one. Photos can be taken in three resolution modes, and with the finest the camera will hold 12 pictures. The middle mode is alright for quick snaps and allows for more than double that amount of pictures.


 On the bad side, there is a delay of 10-15 seconds between taking pictures which can be annoying if you have to take several in a row. 

 Battery life is short. Very, very short.
It is not uncommon for me to have to change batteries after only 15-20 pictures. Use of the LCD screen dramatically reduces the battery life. 

 The camera is bulky and heavy, not exactly pocket size, and if you could get it in there it would probably tear right through your pocket. 

 It is quite awkward to hold as well, I can't even count how many times I thought I'd taken a great picture, only to find upon further examination that my finger was in the way of the shot.

 In the end, it all comes down to "You get what you pay for." Don't expect to buy this camera and have a high-end digital, because it's not. It's one of the best of the Low-end cameras, because many of the other ones almost seem like toys, (Jam Cam?!?), and take photos that look like they were beamed from Pluto.

 If however, you are looking for a Digicam that won't break the bank, and don't care about enlarging and framing your photos, then the Polaroid PDC-700 may be for you.
