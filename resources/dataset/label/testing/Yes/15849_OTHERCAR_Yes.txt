            If you want a tough truck and one that has a lot of room to carry anything then I suggest the Suburban.  This machine is built to last.  I have had two and the miles I have put on both of them was amazing.  My first one I added up around 200,000 miles of tough driving,  I'm not talking shipping kids to soccer practice or anything.  I'm talking about hauling a monster trailer with loads in them.  The first suburban was a 1500.  It was able to pull the trailer easily.  The second one I invested into last year was a 2500.   This baby, when it hauls, doesn't feeling different at all.  It's a tank. The great thing about this vehicle is that it's AMERICAN made.  Also, I haven't had any serious problems with anyone of them.  They hold up great.  They truly get the job done well.  When the machine is in 4 wheel drive there is no stopping it.  I have never gotten stuck and I even have helped out plow trucks who have gotten stuck in bad weather and pulled them out.  This is an investment that you won't be upset about.  Buy one and you'll be more than pleased.<br><br>
