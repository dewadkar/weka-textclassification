            I am now driving my second second-hand Geo Metro, which says a lot right there about my satisfaction with the brand. My first Geo purchase was a love-on-first-sight affair. In fact, I bought it without even a test-drive, and NEVER regretted the purchase. Cherry-red, the now-discontinued Lsi Convertible model (1991), I drove this little gem happily for 8 years. She got 50 miles per gallon no matter what kind of driving I did, and the only repairs I needed to make were a new muffler and new brake pads ... and those only after driving her hard for 6 years and 90,000 miles! Most amazing was the quality of the factory-original battery. It finally died in the last year I owned the car ... no one, from the AAA guy to the station attendant who sold me a new battery, could believe that the original battery had lasted 8 full years. Like the bumblebee that doesn't know it can't fly, I guess! The upholstery and all interior fittings held up beautifully ... no cracks, tears, or even worn spots. I never experienced any kind of mechanical or electrical troubles, and the engine seemed to only require regular maintenance and tune-ups. Truly a trouble-free vehicle. And with the fantastic mileage, I once drove from N. California to Wyoming and back on vacation ... total cost for gas: $75.

The ONLY reason I finally traded in the convertible was that the soft top began to really go to pieces. And, because the model has been discontinued, I couldn't get a replacement. If I could have bought a new top, I'd have planned to drive the car another 10 years. Instead, I purchased (online, yet!) a 1996 Geo Metro hatchback. Also red. Also darling. Slightly lower mileage due to air-conditioning and being a bit heavier than the convertible, but I still routinely get 43 mpg. Again, altho' the car is already 4-5 years old, it still looks new and has displayed no unpleasant quirks in the 5 months I've been driving her. The car has plenty of get-up-and-go, handles well, and is very comfortable to drive. The hatchback's back seat drops down very easily, offering an amazing amount of cargo space for such a small car. You'll be amazed at what you can cram into her after an antiqueing expedition, for example! Sightlines are very good ... only very small &quot;blind spots,&quot; which, of course, all cars have. 

The only drawback that should be mentioned is that the light weight of the car makes it a bit nervous-making to drive in very strong winds. If you regularly commute over a windy bridge, for example, it could get tedious to always be fighting to stay in your lane during strong gusts. On the other hand, the high mileage makes this a fabulous commute car. And the small size makes it a parking dream. 

In summary, the Geo Metro is a reliable, high-mileage vehicle that you can count on. And affordable, too! Enjoy. So honk when you see a little red one ... it might be me!
