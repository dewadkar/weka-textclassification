            In March of 2003, I(or should I say, my mother) bought my first car. In all fairness, I should not have been able to afford it, but due to certain circumstances and some good haggling, $3,000 was knocked off its $7,200 price. (Also included was a Sony Explod deck and 6 x 9 speakers.) With 81,000 miles on it at time of purchase, I was guaranteed at least three years. (The reason for so many miles being it was a company's rental car for a few years.) I checked its VIN number on CarFax and it passed with flying colors. 

March

One week after purchase, the ignition tumbler collapsed in a parking lot 3 miles away from home. Meaning, my key would go only half-way in and that was that. According to some reviews and my wonderful dealer, that was a reoccurring problem in the '98 model. (Funny he forgot to mention that until it happened...) I did not buy a warranty with the car and the tumbler was not part of the warranty anyway, yet the towing and the repair of the car was free. No problems after that, except I noticed the mileage wasn't too hot. 

May

My left passenger window decided not to go down from its controls anymore, however, it would go up. I assume it's a wiring problem. My air conditioner also does not work on the 1 and 2 controls although 3,4,and 5 work quite nicely. I suppose I'll need a filtering.

During the spring and summer, I made many trips out to a local college 15 miles away once a week without any problems. I also made two smooth trips down to Washington,DC and to Ohio a week after, nothing occurring except the adding of many miles. I got great mileage on both trips. 

August

By now, me being a drive-happy kid, there is about 89,000 miles on it. I took it in for an oil change about two weeks ago and she's back to eating gas like there's no tomorrow. I was also informed that I need a new right tire. Two of the bulbs in the left rear lights went out on me, but that problem was taken care of. Being a college student, affording these nice little "adjustments" is becoming a problem. 

On the good side, as it being my first car, I am rather impressed with it. No '87 Taurus for me. As a V6, I think it does quite well and I can only hope I get the rest of those three years.
