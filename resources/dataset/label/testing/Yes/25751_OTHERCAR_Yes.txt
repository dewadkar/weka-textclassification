            I have the new turbo beetle and i will tell you one thing it has got to be the best car I've ever driven. Its hard to belive that the old and the new are from the same company, from the high quality stereo to the great handling its  wonderful. I love it unlike the older models, which were very loud and ugly.The only bad thing I can think of is why didn't they think of it sooner? And for the price you cant beat it. I love my car i would not trade it for any thing well almost any thing, it would be a different story if it were a 65 Impala.<br><br>
