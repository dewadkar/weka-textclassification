            It has officially been over three weeks that I have enjoyed my brand new car, my 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier 2 door Coupe.  Why a Chevy Cavalier?  Well my previous car was a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier 4 door sedan and it never gave me transmission problems and was an excellent car for me with low expenses.  The only complaint I had was the power it had and the gas mileage.  Well Chevrolet must have heard these complaints because they are non-existent in the new Chevrolet 2004 Cavalier.

The 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier has a 2.2L DOHC 4 Cylinder Ecotec Engine with 140 Horsepower.  I decided on a standard rather than an automatic as I had heard it had better pick up and than it used to!   Well from what I understand Chevrolet redesigned their engine for the 2003 model and it has a longer lasting engine, 125K mile tune up to be exact.  The spark plugs are platinum tipped and don't need to be looked at 125K miles as well.  The Engine is COMPLETELY Different!!!  I feel like I am driving a race car when I get in my 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier.  It is fun to drive and 1st and 2nd gear really have a lot of power that wasn't as expected.  My fiance and I still manage to squeal the tires once in a while not realizing the power behind the 1st gear.  Chevrolet calls the standard engine a GETRAG 5 speed manual transmission.  

The Chevrolet Cavalier came with A/S Steel Belted Radial Tires - P195/70R14 as standard.  I have to say that I have used the tires on the hot oil slicked pavement in Arizona in the heat and the rain.  I have been very impressed with how the tires have held their own and I haven't had any problems stopping or starting the car at lights.  

The Brakes are excellent in the 2004 Cavalier.  You can be going 50, shift down and with the brakes applied and come to a full stop in just a few seconds with no problems.  The brakes are touchy at first and you have to get used to their power as I did.  There are power front disc brakes and rear drum brakes on the 2004 Cavalier.

There is power rack and pinion steering which is pretty custom on all cars these days.  Nothing to cheer about but it helps to have it.  

There are driver and passenger airbags equipped in the 2004 Cavalier.  There is a passlock theft deterrent system in it.  Should someone try to start the car with the wrong key, they won't be able to get anywhere.  There is a red light that blinks to warn theives.  The sport mirrors are breakaway and in the base model are black.  In the other coupes that are LS they are custom colored to the color that you choose.  The breakaway mirror always helps if you get too close to pulling into your apartment gate to push in your gate code and you accidentally tap the pole next to it.  Yes, I never said I was a perfect driver!   There are daytime running lights which is pretty standard on all Chevrolets these days but I like having them for extra safety.  There is a LATCH System in the back seat for car seats, should I ever pop out a kid in the future!  For now, it is just nice to know that I have that option.

Speaking of the backseat, it is actually surprisingly comfortable.  We went to buy a large tv that wouldn't fit in our trunk and had to put in the passenger side front so I rode in the back.  I wouldn't recommend putting five adults back there but I would say that two adults could comfortably fit in the back.  There are three seatbelts for three people should you need it though.  

The seats are 60/40 split back.  This is a wonderful feature so you can go on a road trip and store the extra stuff in the back like your skis.  There is actually two cloth pulls that you pull from the trunk and the seats flip down.  The seats lay flat down and you have your extra space you need!

The car came equipped with composite halogen headlights and you can see crystal clear at night with enough vision of what is in front of you.  There is a stainless steel exhaust in the back.  Now let's get to the good stuff, the front interior...

There is air conditioning which is standard on the coupe which in Arizona you can't live without.  There is a am/fm stereo with cd player.  It doesn't play burned cds but there is an option to go up and get an mp3 player already installed in certain Cavaliers.  You just have to ask.  We don't burn cds all that often enough to care.  We are just happy to have a cd plauer rather than cassette deck.  There is a button on the right side to open up the trunk all you have to do is push it.  We didn't notice it at first since on our 1996 cavalier there was a latch you pulled up on the floor of the car, so this is a different feature they updated.  There is a tachometer and trip odometer that is digital inside which makes it easy to read.  The rear window has a defogger.  There is a center console that opens up with two cup holders for the back seat on the lid and inside another cup holder that you can take out.  There is enough space for about 6 cd cases to hold inside.  The best part for me is the standard bucket seats, which I love.  They are sooooo comfy!  They come as fabric in the Coupe model base but I think you can upgrade to leather should you choose.  The only thing I miss is my map lights.  It is not a standard feature and the one light inside the car does dim when you close and open the door.  However you have to push a lever forward for it to come on on the driver's side.  In the rear there are heating or cooling air ducts so that they get enough air in back as well as in front.  There is a tilt steering wheel which comes with the Popular Package.  Also on the Popular package is:
Floor Mats Front and Rear
Intermittent Wipers
AM/FM Stereo with CD
Console with 5th cupholder that can be taken out
Body side Color Moldings for those dings and such by others
Mirror on both sides in the front underneath the visor when pulled down
Front Mud Guards
Ashtray and Cigarette Lighter
There is a second cigarette lighter outlet on the passenger side for power as well

So how does it drive?  Well on the highway there really isn't too much outside noise.  It is not picture perfect quiet but it is an improvement from the 1996 Cavalier.  I don't think it is any different from any other models that come close the Cavalier.  The city driving is comfortable and your butt doesn't start to hurt on the longer trips.  The bucket seats really help out.  The gas mileage is listed at 26/37 but I actually get 32/43.  It has a great gas mileage compared to the automatic 1996 Cavalier.  It takes on speed bumps and other bumps in the road fine.  There isn't a lot of jumping around by any means should you hit a divet in the road.  The car, like I said earlier has great pick up and can get to 0 to 60 in about 6-7 seconds which I think is great for a 4 cylinder 140 horsepower car.  The gauges are easy to read and are slightly toward geared towards the driver's side for easy handling.  The buttons and knobs are big enough to touch.  The radio was easy to figure out and put in my favorite radio stations.  The Anti Lock Brake System really makes stopping a breeze.  The only thing that isn't standard on the car is keyless entry, which I will be installing along with an alarm.  I could have opted up but the price wasn't worth it and there is a place in town that does it for $25.00 a door.  

Overall I am extremely pleased with my Chevrolet Cavalier and felt I made the right decision buying another one.  It was a good investment at $10K and I felt I got enough in return for the price.  The Coupe and Sedans range from $10K - $16K on invoice and a little bit more for MSRP.  You can definitely bargain.  We were able to get it with no money down, just using our trade in and $5K rebate.  

So go out and get your Chevrolet Cavalier.  Afterall, it is a Winner because where there's a Winner's Circle, There is a Chevy!

Until next time,
