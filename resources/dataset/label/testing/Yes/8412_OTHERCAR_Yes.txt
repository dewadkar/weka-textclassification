            I'm spoiled by also using the Olympus C-2000Z at work (I'm the sports editor for a newspaper), but I started with the D-600L and I've had some great results for it (along with some not-so-great results).

It's wonderful for taking stills and for outdoor action photos in good sunlight, but it's not so great for action shots in cloudy weather and it bites at night football games. Flash photos show up very dark in the viewfinder and upon initial opening of the image in Photoshop, but manipulation lightens them up well, so it's mostly a problem in viewing while taking photos.

It's bulky but not heavy, and the camera controls are fairly simple. The resolution is very good for general use, but for the needs of a newspaper it's a little lacking because we need very large image sizes for pagination.

Timing is not much of a problem in still shots, but it's difficult for action shots. I learned to anticipate as much as I could. I don't like the recovery time at all between shots, though. I still gripe about the time I took a blurry shot of a wonderful foul-tip catch to end an inning(blurry because I had to take it so fast that I didn't have much of a chance), only to miss the shot of the catcher leaping into the pitcher's arms immediately afterward because I couldn't take another picture.

I've taken some wonderful nature shots with this baby, though. I can't complain about its quality for outdoor stills at all.

With the exception of the &quot;Sports2&quot; album, and a couple of scanned photos in other albums, all the images were taken with the D-600L, including a bunch of sports shots in an album called &quot;Sports1.&quot; There are some great nature shots, too.<br><br>
