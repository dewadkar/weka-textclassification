            This is the car my parents sent me to college in.  My mother bought it over Christmas break of my sophomore year of high school.  I am now in my second semester of college, and have been driving it since I got I turned sixteen two and a half years ago.   We bought it because of a radio add, but even the suggested retail price is extremely low for a car of this high quality.  I have a 94 model, and I love it.  It has a four cylinder engine with a standard transmission.  It gets thirty miles to the gallon, 35 when I'm on the highway with the A/C turned off.  I love the handling, its not a sports car, but its fun to take corners.  I also like the stereo.  The factory speakers are very nice, I'm not the kind to play the radio loud, so this is all I need.  The quality of sound is great, but the reception strength of the radio is not the best, you might want to get an antenna booster.  The seats are comfortable, but if you are more than six feet tall, you can't wear a hat and drive.  I don't recomend it for anyone over six one, sometimes I have a hard time getting head room.  The climate control system works very well, but is difficult to keep adjusted where I want it.  The heater can be turned on after traveling a mile, and the air conditioner is very cold if left on very long.  The controls are not very precise, I have to fiddle with them constantly to stay comfortable.  Someone needing simple transportation, especially if you do a lot of driving, could make extensive use of this car.  It has been taken to the shop once since we had it, and that was to replace a cvc joint my driving had messed up.  It is very reliable.<br><br>
