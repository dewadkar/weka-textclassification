            (Updated - 5000km & 20000km additions at end..)

In summary - I'm very happy with my 'Brilliant Green' (metallic) 2002 Lanos SE 1.5l 3-door hatch.  It has alloys/spoiler/air-con/cd etc, and it cost just a shade over A$16000 on road.  (That's around US$10K.)

The dazzling green (this colour may not be available in the US sadly) alloy wheels and for-show-only spoiler do a lot to improve the look of the car IMO - the picture above looks pretty boring...

<b>From the web..</b>
First, I pored over the web looking for any bad reports about this vehicle, and found very few.  There were almost no reports of anything breaking, except the cup-holders (grin).  There are some concerns about the future of Daewoo vehicles in the US (GM seems to want to own everything except existing US Daewoo owner's warranties).  But here in Oz it looks pretty rosy now that GM have taken over the entire operation.  They are becoming quite a common sight on Australian roads, with good reason I think.  The current deal here includes a 3-yr/100,000km free service and roadside assistance package, which is further reassurance.

<b>Value</b> 
First up, it's great value - my deal included the alloys, spoiler, very good CD stereo system, all on top of the basic car which down here has aircon and power steering as standard.  Despite hearing disparaging comments about fit and finish, I am very happy with the quality at this price level.

<b>Performance and On-road comfort</b> 
After many test drives, I can say that it drives as well as, or better than, any of the competition (Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, etc), and in fact only the Subaru Impresza impressed me more (hardly surprising at its price!)..  Sure, the Daewoo is not a high performance car but it is very snappy around town and cruises happily at 120/130 kph (65-70 mph) with enough in reserve for sensible overtaking.  The gearing is excellent, with 4th gear usable at 110kph for an extra surge, and 5th really drops the revs down for good economy.  A light clutch, good-not-great brakes (heel-toe-able!) and precise gearshift all make it very enjoyable to drive.

Touring in the Lanos is very comfortable - it is sure-footed at high speed, handles bumps and wind gusts well for a small car and is relatively quiet.  The engine is muted unless really pushed and road noise is reasonably well suppressed, but there is some low whistling from the spoiler (which I am growing quite fond of!).  It 'straight-lines' very well - some larger power-steered cars I've driven wander badly at high speed.  The Lanos is nicely balanced and quite stable on dirt and gravel, with gentle understeer nicely controllable into oversteer.  That surprised me - maybe it's my technique, as I am very used to flinging little fwds around in the dirt.  But it is annoyingly noisy on gravel as stones are flicked up and hit the underside - I might invest in a bit of spray on undersealer to reduce the clatter.

<b>Interior Comfort</b> 
The big surprise - I am 6'2" (189cm), with legs to match, and I fit *comfortably*!  The Lanos is easily the best of the cars I drove for comfort and roominess in the front.  Even if I could afford the Impresza I wouldn't have considered it because my knees were crammed up into the dash.  Ouch.  With me in the front the rear seat passenger is cramped, but if the front seat is adjusted for a 'normal' person the rear legroom is better than you would expect for a car this small.

<b>Quality Control</b> 
The fit and finish is good for this price range - it's no Rolls, but at the same time it is very neat and tidy, and the duco (paintwork) is surprisingly good - the metallic green looks stunning, with a superb mirror finish.  Mine did have a small blemish on the rear bumper, but that is being redone under warranty.  No sign of rattles/squeaks.

<b>Sound</b> 
The supplied CD-stereo ('Boss') is not hugely powerful (although I think US versions get a different one), but the acoustics in the car are just great - the 4 small speakers can deliver amazingly deep bass.  I'm a hi-fi buff, so this isn't a totally uninformed opinion ;-).

<b>Fuel Economy</b> 
I am already impressed - even in this running-in phase - mainly around town driving, varying speeds, etc - it is returning about 7.2l/100km (US32mpg).  I am confident it will return around 5.5l/100km (US43mpg) when touring.  Note that mine is the 1.5 litre manual version.  By the way, I just love the engine compartment - very neat and everything is nicely accessible.

<b>Criticisms</b> 
I guess US folk should be concerned about whether GM is serious about marketing the Daewoo in your country - but 'down-under' and in Europe it seems there is no question about Daewoo's future (tv ads, new deals, new models being released, etc).  My only reservation might be that the Lanos fared badly in the latest Oz crash test results - largely because here it *doesn't* come with airbags as standard.  A couple of very minor annoyances - the headlights aren't great (a relatively cheap set of xenon H4 globes helped dramatically) and it could use a few more receptacles for sunglasses/cd's etc..


Summing up, the Lanos is obviously not a big family car, nor for those who like large or powerful vehicles.  But if you're on a tight budget, and after something small, sensible and fun to drive - take a very close look.. 

** UPDATE **
5000 km:  The new car honeymoon period is over, but if anything, I am more impressed now..!  The engine and gearbox has freed up nicely, so I have no want for more power (I'm too old to admit this, but it is VERY quick away from the lights!).  I travelled over 1500km (950 miles) in a couple of days recently and had no back problems or discomfort from the trip, some of which was travelled at quite high speeds (140kph/85mph).  The car simply doesn't feel like a compact on the open road.  No problems whatsoever, fuel economy is as I expected above.  Love it!

** 2nd update **
20000 km: Not much to report, which is good!  No problems other than a very minor and fixable rattle from one of the rear hatch windows when open.  Currently enjoying the  aircon which handles the Oz summer very well.  Am about to replace the aerial with a spring loaded job - it's bit silly to mount it on the passenger side so that a close encounter with a tree demolishes it.. :o(  But that's all I can complain about so I think my initial enthusiasm for this car was entirely warranted!  Haven't regretted the purchase for even a split second - still love it..
