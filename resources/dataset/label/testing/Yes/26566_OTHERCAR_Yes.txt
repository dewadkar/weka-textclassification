            In Aug. Of 96 I bought my first Nissan car ever and it was a Sentra.  I have a 1993, so the car was 3 years old and it had about 30,000 miles on it.  I was looking for a car that was going to be cheep on payments,insurance,gas, and repairs.  After looking at several simmular cars in its' same class I decided on the Sentra.  I feel the sentra has been over all a good car.  The only repairs Iv done are the following:

1. Timing Chain cover started to leak oil @ 35,000mi.  but it was under factory warenty.

2. Replaced driver side strut.

3 Replaced the starter at about 50,000 mi.

Other than just normal prevent maintance.  Its been a good car. I have found that I HAVE to replace my fuel filter about every 6 mo.  I find when it gets dirty my car starts to ping and run ruff and once I replace my fuel filter it solves every thing.  I plan on buying another Nissan for my ext car.  My car now has almost 98,000 miles.  And it still runs like new.<br><br>
