               Our 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis has served us well for over a year since we bought it used in 2001 from Hertrich's in Dover, DE.  We have made several trips into the hills of VA were my wife's family lives, including once when we went down in bad winter weather for a funeral; I was pleased to find that it fared as well as the pick up trucks on the muddy/icy hills, in fact, it may have fared better on the interstate, as we saw that several of those pick ups and SUVs had flipped over in some pretty nasty accidents.  I expect that w/ proper snow chains it would handle as well or better than the much lauded, and very expensive Subarus.  In any case it is much more comfortable and powerful than a Subaru, which makes it the best choice available for a long trip (I wouldn't even consider my wifes Honda!), especially when you consider the full size cabin, trunk, and V8 engine.  
   However, I think that its best feature is the low maintence and repair costs we have incurred; they have averaged less than $80/month for all parts and labor, mostly in parts since while I do most of my own maintenance, I insist on using top grade/OEM parts and use a rigorous schedule, which raises the expense.  I have had to have the following repaired:

-driver's side door handle had to be re-bolted w/ $0.25 worth of parts from local hardware store.
-"key left in ignition" audio signal would not always turn off; fixed w/ $.01 worth of nylon string to tie back the wire for the signal that was shorting on the steering column (be aware that if you have this problem and take it to the dealer to try to fix it they will expect hundreds of dollars to replace other parts that are unlikely to have anything to do with the actual problem, a simple short).
-replaced faulty multifunction (turnsignal) switch on steering column, an $80 part.
-had Monro replace ball joint on front suspension after detected damage during routine brake inspection, cost of $200 parts & labor (required special tool to remove ball joint)
-detected hole at weld to muffler while on hoist at Monro; fixed w/ $5.00 worth of exhaust repair gunk.  We had a nasty winter this year and it damaged the exhaust on my wife's 96 Honda Accord to the degree that it had to be replaced for almost $400.  When I asked the mechanic about the damage the Mercury had sustained he told me that it would be several years till it needed replacing b/c it was a stainless steel system & that it would be less than $200 to replace!
-replaced front side marker lamp assembly after 5mph impact, also damaging front fender fascia.  The lamp cost $80, and the fascia (painted rubber cover over fender that all cars seem to have anymore) would cost $500 or more, so since I have to park it in an apartment parking lot, so I don't see any reason to replace it.

   The gas mileage is pretty good overall, exceptional if you consider that it weighs as much as a medium sized truck, and still only looses 5mpg relative to the 4-cyl Honda Accord.  
   But the worst expense is loss of cash value in the car itself, apparently a problem with all domestic cars, but:
1. I'd sell the Honda 1st anyway and run this car until it finally gives out, probably long after it has lost most of its cash value.  In other words, why would you want to sell it anyway?
2. The loss of its original selling price of $22k to the affordable $8k that we paid for it was also do to this accelerated depreciation on domestics.  For example, a comparable Japanese car (actually a smaller car, with a smaller engine) would have cost over $10k.
