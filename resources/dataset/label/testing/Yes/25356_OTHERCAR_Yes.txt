            Shortly after Christmas, I decided to buy the new Agfa ePhoto Cl30, and after much shopping on the internet, I finally got a good deal for about $289. I read all the reviews of the product, and the only bad news that I heard was &quot;It will eat batteries like crazy.&quot;

Well, I was really too excited to get the new camera, and didn't really think about it, but.. YES, it does eat batteries like crazy. And what does this mean you may ask? Let me tell you:

I took the camera with me on New Years eve to take pictures of the beautiful downtown boston, as well as a new years party with some friends. Using about medium quality, I got about 20 pictures or so, and by the end of the night: Poof. Dead batteries. If you're thinking about using the LCD Display when you're taking the pictures, think again. You will probably get about 5 pictures off before the battery light comes on. This typically puts a big drain on the battery power.

The good thing is, is that the pictures are saved in memory until the camera completely dies, which will not happen unless you repeatedly turn your camera on and off. 

I did put things into perspective though, I plan on buying an AC adapter cable so when I am uploading pictures to my computer, I can save battery juice. Also, what's the cost of 2 AA Batteries? It's less than the price of buying and developing film, am I right? And for the convenience of having my photos right on my computer, I think its worth it.

Although, I do have to say, that this camera is great! It has great picture quality, the software is great, so if you want to take a picture of yourself and post it on the web, you can see what the picture looks like on the computer screen prior to snap.

It came with a 4MB memory card, I believe, which is just fine. At high quality photo (which is recommended) you get about 15. I always had trouble taking 24 pictures, anyway. 

It works for both PC and Macs, and comes with just about every type of connection cable known to man, so you're pretty much all set. This is the reason that I opted for the CL30: It has a digital screen (as the ePhoto Smile does not), and it has a usb port. 

So, for the price, and an amateur photographer, this camera made all the sense. <br><br>
