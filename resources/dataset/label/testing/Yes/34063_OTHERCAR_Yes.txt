               I am 16 years old and it came time for my first car.  I am a car guy.  It's all I do.  I'm into the whole doing-up-the-car thing, and I wanted something small.  I saved for a long time, and being on an extremely tight budget, $1600, I picked up my first car.  I have a 1996 Plymouth Neon Highline.  A lot of people don't know the difference between a Neon and a Neon Highline.  The Neon is the one that comes with the old, flat seats.  The Highline is the one that comes with the new bucket contoured seats and round steering wheel.  Anyway, it had 95k on it, so I got a deal in my eyes!  But then the Neon's reputation lived up to its name.
   The car started for the first month I had it.  But then it would just choke over for the longest time before starting.  I found out I had to replace the coil and EGR valve, which ended up costing me $400.  I was furious, but delt with it.  Then when I reved it, it would make a high pitched sound, and it leaked transmission fluid.  I found out there was a hole in the transmission!  $1800!  People say I'm crazy to put up with this, but now my car starts perfect and has a brand new transmission with a flawless engine.  Still less than what other people have paid all together.
   The car is great!  The interior is very comfortable with well placed gauges, audio, and A/C controls.  Speaking of audio, I mentioned I'm into the whole doing-up-the-car thing.  My car came with just a radio.  I put in a JVC KD-LX30 El Kameleon CD Player, and put in new Pioneer 6.5's in the front and Sony Xplod XS-HD690G 6X9's in the back.  The car rattles like crazy, but only on the outside.  But I can always sound proof the car. The A/C unit is great, but I am out of freon which can be filled easily.  My Neon came with a 2.0L 16 valve SOHC 4 cyc. Automatic which puts out 132hp.  For a stock engine, it's great on gas and can get up and go very quickly!  It handles so well, which makes it very fun to drive.  My dad always takes it!   
   Since I want to do up my car, everyone has told me to get a Civic.  But a lot of people own Civic's, and I can't afford one.  Plus, 1996 Civic's only come with a 1.6L 4 cyc. with only 115hp, and doesn't have driver and passenger airbags like the Neon.  So I'm very happy with my car.
   If you've read this, you're probably looking for a Neon or own one.  If looking for one, I do recommend you do a good inspection, and see what it comes with.  I definetly say go with a Neon.  They're small, economical, and with minor maintenance, can be a great car.
