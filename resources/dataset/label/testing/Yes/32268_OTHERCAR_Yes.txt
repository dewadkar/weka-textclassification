            Why did I trade in my Coolpix 950 for the 995? After owning and using the 950 for almost a year there were just a few shortcomings that irritated me to the point that I didn�t enjoy using the camera anymore. So I realized that there were only a few options open to me. Either dump it in my drawer and forget about it, only to be  taken out when absolutely necessary, or trade it in for one of the newer generation of digital cameras while it was still worth something.

What exactly were those irritating traits I hear you ask? The number one failure for me was its dismal battery life. Take a couple of pictures, scroll through your shots to decide which ones are keepers and which ones to delete, and before you know it, the screen is dead � due to a dead battery. The other main downfall for me was the way the Nikon engineers had set up the options menu concerning the self timer and close-up features, viz. that you could have the one or the other, but not both. This was a big no-no for me as I especially needed the timer feature while taking highly magnified close-up shots of watch movements. Seeing as it�s almost impossible to depress the shutter without even a tiny amount of camera movement, the timer feature would have come in handy had it been an option. Well, it <i>was</i> an option, just not one to be used simultaneously with the close-up feature.

Fortunately  a friend at work was keen on buying my 950, so now the prospect of getting the 995 was made much more affordable. The main reason that I didn�t change brands, but decided to stick with the Nikon, was that I absolutely loved the incredibly sharp and bright pictures of the former, regardless of whether they were taken in the regular mode or using macro.

So how does the 995 stack up against its older generation sibling? Here is a brief rundown keeping in mind what my main uses of the camera are, which is for close-ups of watches and watch parts and general family pictures.

<b>The Good:</b>

Picture quality is still excellent, with the added benefit of having 4X zoom versus 3X for the newer generation model � 8mm to 32mm vs 7mm to 21mm. In the areas of sharpness, contrast, definition and saturation of colors, it seems to be at least as good as the 950, which had an excellent reputation for being outstanding in those areas. To be honest, I can�t really tell if one is better than the other as I would need a professional quality printer to be able to give you an absolute answer. My printer, a new Canon S300 � 2400 X 1200 dpi � is only good enough to show me that they seem to be at least comparable. And certainly excellent enough to satisfy the most demanding users. 

Macro is unchanged, still an amazing 2cm is the closest focusing distance. Flash is now a pop up unit so red eye, while not entirely eliminated, is greatly reduced. The pop up style flash also has the added advantage in that it is automatically off until you deliberately pop it up. The push and rotate set up to access the different menus and options is very easy, logical and straightforward to use. And, oh yes, battery life has been greatly extended. About two hours of continuous use versus about 10 minutes for its predecessor.

While I wish that Nikon would put in a separate button or switch for the self timer, at least now one can use the close-up feature together with it. The downside being that the self timer only operates in the close-up mode which means that the auto focusing is much finer and hence slower versus the regular modes.

The quick review function is really handy, especially considering the delay between the time the shutter is pressed and the picture is actually taken, so one can see whether one made the shot or not, and if so whether it�s a keeper or not.

<b>The Bad:</b>

No complaints from me this time about inadequate documentation. This is a company that obviously listens to their customers. The instruction booklet is complete, and for those requiring larger print, the complete manual is available on the supplied CDROM. 

While I was amazed at the brightness and resolution of the 950�s viewing screen, I�m not too enthusiastic about the one on the 995. Not only is it a little smaller � 4.7cm versus 5cm � but a lot less bright and, regardless of how I adjust the viewing options, lower resolution, especially in low light conditions. Oh well, I guess that�s the price users have to pay for the greatly extended battery life. I have a sneaking suspicion that that the amazing viewing screen was the main culprit for the 950�s dismal battery life.

This is still not a camera for sports aficionados, due to the delay from the time the shutter is released till the time the shot is actually taken. In fact, there is still so much lag that one will probably find this camera inadequate for candid shots, especially if your children are anywhere near as active as mine!!! I honestly don�t think that this is just a shortcoming of Nikon digital cameras in general, or this one in particular, but of all digital cameras, due to the way they work. I think that it will be a few more years before digital cameras will be able to match regular film cameras in the area of speed. When you see the sports action photographers going digital, then you�ll know that they�ve overcome that weakness.

The viewfinder is still not much to write home about. But I realize that if Nikon were to give it a true through the lens viewfinder, both the cost and size would increase dramatically.

This final criticism is not really a serious one. But now one has so many options that  when one scrolls through the different menus some have more than one page. Read the instructions and just practice going through them to get comfortable and familiar with all of them and how to switch between them. In order to see how intuitive the camera is to use, I managed to figure them all out without reading the instruction booklet. To all of my friends and family whom I have chided in the past for not reading the instructions, I humbly apologize. As the saying goes �when all else fails, read the instructions�.

<b>The Ugly:</b>

While still not an attractive camera by any means � the Canon Elph wins that award hands down � the swivel feature definitely makes the camera easier to hold firmly and minimizes its bulk while not in use. The 995 doesn�t have the same metal body as the 950, so it does give the impression of being less solidly built than the latter. Although my experience has been that the polycarbonate type of plastics that the camera manufacturers use is very tough. On the plus side it does have the added advantage of reducing the cameras weight.

<b>Final Thoughts:</b>

Although the 995 comes with a USB cable to hook it up directly to one�s comp, I still prefer to use a card reader as it frees up the camera for other uses. Coupled with the fact that I don�t need to deplete the camera�s battery or hook up the AC adaptor. As I mentioned in my 950 review, even although the prices of mega storage cards have fallen dramatically, I�m still not a fan of them for the reasons given. I use either a 16MB or 32MB Compact Flash card. Maybe I would be more keen on them if I printed larger photos. As I don�t print anything larger than 8� X 10� I don�t need the higher resolution, hence no need for massive storage cards. 

All in all I�m very happy with my purchase and even although I miss the incredible clarity of the 950�s viewing screen, I�m pleased that I made the upgrade. Email me for any further questions or comments. Gary.
