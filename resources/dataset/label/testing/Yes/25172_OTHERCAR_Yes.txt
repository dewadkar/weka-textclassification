            We just purchased a new 2000 Protege EX as the 2001 models are coming in, to save a few bucks.  I heard and read that this was a very reliable car with touches of more expensive cars. We have had the car a few days, and already some impressions are being made...for example:

The ride is stiff...not overly stiff...but stiff nonetheless. It reminds me of a sports car.  The car handles very well, the steering is precise and responsive, and tight.  This stiffness does make the ride harsher than other cars we have had, but it is definitely not &quot;sloshy&quot;.  There is a tradeoff there, and Mazda apparently determined that a tight suspension is going to attract the type of customers that the car is marketed towards, namely, the Generation X'ers on a tight budget.  I am not in that generation, but I like the tight suspension myself, as I feel much more in control of the car.

As for quietness...the road sounds do come through, as does some engine noises, especially during acceleration.  It is a moderately quiet car. My other car (which I have also reviewed here) is a 2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS, and I have to say that the Mazda is not nearly as quiet as the Hyundai, but it is reasonable, and acceptable, for a compact car that doesn't cost a whole lot.

Everything seems to work well.  The layout of the dash is good.  The ventilation controls are a bit confusing, and maybe a bit on the cheap side.  The radio/CD player also works well, and sounds surprisingly well for such an inexpensive car.  The cruise control works perfectly.  Braking seems decent.  There is a slight buzziness on the steering wheel at high speeds, but I think that is coming from the tires, and also maybe because of the suspension characteristics mentioned before.

A big plus of this car is the interior room, and especially the cargo area.  The trunk is very large for a small car.  It is not cramped, compared to other cars in this category that I looked at.  

The seats are solid, and not cheap feeling or appearing.  The support of the seats is rather firm also, but somewhat adjustable.  The interior of the car looks quite nice too.

The sheet-metal strikes me as being rather thin.  Maybe I am not used to compact cars, but go ahead and knock on the outside of the car, and you get a distinctive feeling that the metal is not all that thick.  I have read, though, that the body integrity of this car is very strong, like you are riding in a cage.  At least that is what the manufacturer says in their literature.

We have the smaller of the two engines for Proteges.  It works.  It is definitely not a heavy-duty powerplant, with just over 100 HP, but it is decent, and adequate.  The engine is very smooth, though, and idles almost imperceptably (you don't even know the car is running).  The car accelerates very smoothly, although without substantial power.  Maybe the larger engine would satisfy people who want to be able to pass with more punch.  The transmission seems flawless, again, being very smooth, and shifting is very subtle. 

Bottom line: it seems to be a well built car with many very good strong points, including pricing, with only slight compromises being made in areas that Mazda felt they could get away with unnoticed.  This is definitely not a Mercedes, or even a Sonata, but in its class, I would say you can't go wrong.  The reliability reviews I have read all have been very good, but I cannot speak from experience on this issue yet.

Good luck!
