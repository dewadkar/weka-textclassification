            I purchased my Pontiac Montana in February 1999. I have put over 20,000 miles on it since then, and it has never been back to dealer. Being an autoworker for over twenty years, I can really appreciate the quality and innovations that have been put into this vehicle. It has driver and passenger side air bags and also front passenger side impact air bags. Mine came with two captains chairs in front, bucket seats in center and 60/40 seats in rear. I have hauled full 4x8 foot sheet of plywood in back after removing center and rear seats. I am an avid scuba diver, and when my wife and I and two of our dive buddies have to pack all of our equipment for a weekend dive trip, trust me it takes up alot of space. Before I bought the Montana, I had an S-10 Blazer, and it would not hold all of our stuff without putting half of it on roof carrier. We have been on several dive trips with my Montana and had no problem packing all our stuff inside just by taking out rear seat. My wife and I have already decided that our next new vehicle will definitely be another Pontiac Montana! <br><br>
