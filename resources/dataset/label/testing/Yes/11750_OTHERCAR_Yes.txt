            Let's just say I've been wanting a digital camera with a flash for eons.  My experience with digital cameras was only with a Panasonic that worked good if you had more than adequate lighting.  There was no flash.  It was like using a camera from the dark ages.  Or wait, did they have cameras back in the olden days?

I've been asking for a digital camera for Christmas and birthdays for quite a few years.  Due to the expense, I guess no one has been able to afford one as a gift for me.  That is until Circuit City had an awesome sale the day after Thanksgiving.

I LOVE this camera!  It's got an LCD screen that you can see your picture as soon as it is taken.  You can also review all the pictures in memory.  Without an extra memory card, I can take about 22 pictures before I either have to delete some, print them out, or put them on the PC.

This camera even has a zoom!  My regular 35mm doesn't even have that.  The zoom really impressed me.  It brings the person/object 2x closer.

So far the quality is great.  If you are too close with the flash on, the pictures don't turn out.  Easy cure, don't stand too close.

You can change your flash settings as well.  You can turn the flash off, turn it on automatic, or turn it so that it will only flash when needed.

There are several other settings too, for quality, white balance, previewing, deleting, zooming,  and reviewing.  You can even see a slide show on the LCD screen.

Another thing I have on here is the capability (with an extra cord) of showing the pictures on tv.  That I think is a really cool idea.

As with every product there are bound to be SOME drawbacks.  These are the one's I've found;  there is a few second delay in when you snap the picture and when it is taken.  So if you're taking pictures of active children, it's not as easy to get the shot you want.  The other thing is the batteries don't last long.  In the owners manual it suggests buying the Nimh batteries and a battery charger.  I may do that, we'll see.  This is still cheaper than having the pictures developed.

Transferring the pictures from camera to computer is also easy as pie.  Plug it in, turn it on, switch it to PC mode and it finds the pictures.  You select the one's you want to save and boom, it saves them.  It probably takes about a minute per picture.  Not bad if you ask me.  The Panasonic I had took almost 45 minutes just for 10 pictures.

I love my camera, and if you have a tight budget and a desperate need for a digital camera (was it a need or a want, I haven't figured it out yet), this is a great one for you too.
