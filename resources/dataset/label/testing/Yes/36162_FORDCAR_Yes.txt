            In my opinion, this is the best car for the money. I bought the ZTS Sedan edition with leather seats and side airbags. The leather seats are excellent, and I love how the seat height is adjustable.  The view out of the car is nearly SUV-like in that you get a great view of the road ahead.  The view out the rear isn't all that great due to the high trunk. Also, the view out the side mirrors isn't great either, but I am going to get those round spot mirrors.  Engine has excellent power, with seemingly great fuel economy.  CD player is excellent, I love the Automatic Volume Control that adjusts the volume of the music to how much engine/road noise there is.  The brakes feel powerful.  My car has Firestone Firehawk tires, which seem to make more noise than the Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires that are on other Focuses that I drove.  The steering is absolutely first class, with really great handling.  The steering wheel tilts AND TELESCOPES, which is unbelievable.  Not sure what I think about the fake wood on the dash, however.  The climate control system is awesome.  I really like how it allows you to control the A/C separate in the different modes, instead of the A/C automatically coming on when you chose certain modes.  Those of you who own Fords probably know what I'm talking about. <br><br>
