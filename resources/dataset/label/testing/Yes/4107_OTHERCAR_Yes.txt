            I always thought Oldsmobiles were reserved for the over 65 age bracket.  This car changed my mind!  The Intrigue offers plenty of room inside, but doesn't feel like you're hogging the road.  It feels somewhat sporty, but it handles really well like a larger car.  You can comfortably seat five people in the Intrigue, which is a plus.  The gas mileage could be better, since I had driven a 1990 Toyota Camry before this I was used to better gas mileage.  But, I think it's pretty good for a car its size.  This car has had no problems during the time we have had it.  I highly recommend it.<br><br>
