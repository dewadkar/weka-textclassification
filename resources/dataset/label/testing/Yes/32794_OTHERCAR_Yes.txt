            Me and my family love corvettes.  On the day I was born my dad ordered a Corvette and I was the first to sit in it when I was 4 months old.  My grandfather started a garage many years ago and they specialize in Corvettes.  They are excellent performance vehicles and I highly recommend them.  If you have a chance to visit the Corvette Factory in Bowling Green, Kentucky I would highly recommend it.  When I went several years ago we saw Rick Mears' car being built (he is a race car driver).  Corvettes aren't very practical and we do not drive them in the rain or snow but they are the best American sports car.<br><br>
