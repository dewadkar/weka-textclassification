            Woooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!Horsey
I went from one Honda to another and Boy the difference it will make. I had a Honda Civic 4 door before I bought this car. I loved the first but, I love the second even more. 
This car may be a little small but if you don't have children or a bunch of people to tote around it's the way to go. I traded my Civic in for a Honda CRX SI 1.6 liter 5 speed. I couldn't have ask for a better car. 

COMFORT:
This car can be roomy if your not trying to pile it full of people. Preferably 2 people is enough. You can take a trip out of state and still be comfortable. Theres plenty of room to stretch your legs, and kick back. I play in a lot of pool tournaments so that calls for a lot of traveling . The gas mileage is nice too. 

DURABILITY:
I've never had a wreck in this car and hope to never have one but as far as the durability goes they are very sturdy cars considering the size. 

STYLE: 
Everyone wants the sporty look these days and you can get that with the CRX without the high priced insurance. The CRX has it's own unique style which I like very much. My sister just recently became single and know has decided that she wants to buy my car because she looks good in it. So I guess that means my car makes a person look good. Not in a conceited way but I guess I would probably say the same thing if I was single. So more or less this car makes you look good because it looks good.

RELIABILITY:
To me Honda's in general are the most reliable cars. I have had my CRX for about 3 years and have done practically nothing to it. For the most part all that has been done to my car is regular maintenance, and that's just part of having a car. My CRX gets me wherever I need to go day or night. I enjoy my CRX. I wished Honda still made the CRX. I might have to buy a new one if they did, not saying I would get rid of the one I have but I would like to see a newer model with the same kind of style.

PS You know the car in the picture looks just like mine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
