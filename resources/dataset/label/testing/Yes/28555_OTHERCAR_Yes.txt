            I think most people, at one point or another, have wanted that Jeep Wrangler. It was my dream car when I turned 16 and earned that much awaited right to drive. However, I didn't end up getting one until 9 years later. No big deal since the Wrangler hasn't changed much with the exception of round headlights and a cleaner dash.
My Jeep was the 2.5L 4 cylinder engine connected to 
a 5-speed tranny. What a dog!! The 2.5 barely lugs the weight of the Wrangler and although the performance will be suffice for some, don't try to cut in front of oncoming traffic unless you're looking for a problem.
The ride and comfort level in the cabin leaves much to be desired and carrying a conversation in the soft top is an adventure in itself. You could always go for the hard top, but I feel that defeats the purpose of the Wrangler.
Maintainance is good, however, in that the Jeep (contrary to popular belief) is a very hassle free ride. It takes low octane fuel and you could "forget" a few oil changes and not be dumped on the side of the road to the sound of grinding metal and a screeching hault.
Here is what I suugest to anybody looking for or considering a Wrangler:
-If at all possible, try to get the 4.0L I6 engine. It's much stronger, more powerful and tried and tested in Jeep for a very long time.
-If you have to get the 4 cylinder, try to get the manual transmission. It makes up for (to some degree) the sluggishness that will ultimately cause a trade in for something with more zip.
-The issue of the soft top is a tricky one. Like I mentioned earlier, opting for the hard top sort of defeats the purpose of a Wrangler, but driving and carrying a conversation in the Soft top is a bit lackluster. If funds permit, I suggest taking the dual top option which will allow you to switch between hard and soft tops depending on what type of excursion you're planning for the day. If you can't afford the dual top (I couldn't), then really consider if the Wrangler is for you. 
-The Wrangler handles in the rain like a hippo wearing ice skates on slick ice. If you do plenty of highway driving then this ride may be a problem. However, if your driving routine consists mostly of around town and especially outdoorsy stuff, few vehicles will provide you more enjoyment than the Wrangler in that you can go anywhere and take in the sun.
The strongest point of the Wrangler is the resale value. I realize some may disagree with me on that but those are unfortunates that may have had a nasty surprise when a dealer under-allowed them on a Wrangler trade. I sold these for a living and took many on trade. The Wrangler has the best resale value of any non-highline auto. They last a long time and still have that classic look which makes them a asset to any used car dealer lot.
Tread Lightly!!!
