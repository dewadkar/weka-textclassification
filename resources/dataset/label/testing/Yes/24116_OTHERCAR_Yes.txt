            The name speaks for itself, LEGEND, made by Acura, engine manufactured by Honda. This car is by far in a class by itself when it comes to midsize luxury. I bought this car due to the fact that I owned an Acura Integra and drove it until it had 188,000 miles and it was still running strong when I sold it for $6,000, so dependability and resale is also high on my list as an incentive for owning a fine automobile such as the Legend. I also believe that Honda is a very reliable automobile manufacturer, having owned two previous Hondas, one an 88 Civic and a 93 Accord, never once having any major problems with either vehicle.
The Legend drives and handles beautifully, it is a very remarkable car, due to the fact that I bought this car used I had it pre inspected although the Acura dealer told me that the car was in tip top shape. True to his word the car was in the best shape of any car with the mileage and years on it. I settled for a 91 Legend with 83,000 miles on it and you couldn't tell if I drove by that my vehicle is 8 years old, very excellent condition.
Anyone out there that wants to experience true luxury at an affordable price, and is in the market for a used car, shop for a legend, it is definitely worth every dollar you spend. At least test drive one even if you feel that you can't afford it, I'm sure that you will find a way to buy it, the car is just that nice.       <br><br>
