            I love the Pontiac Grand Ams.  I bought a 1999 Grand Am GT last August and I get nothing but compliments. My car is a two door and is fully loaded. I do a lot of driving and I feel this vehicle is very comfortable for long trips. 
Inside the Grand Am GT the look is sleek and sporty.  Everything in the car is automatic from the power windows, locks, and sunroof.  The GT model of the 1999 Grand Am's also come with an upgraded sound system.  The speakers are awesome. 
The look of the 1999 Grand Am's are very sporty, but also have a very modern classy look.  My car has the V-6 engine and has the Ram air.  Let me tell you, this car can pick up speed.  
The only down fall of this car is that it uses a lot of gas.  It eats so much gas, other then that, I love my car!<br><br>
