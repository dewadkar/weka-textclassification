            I've had my 89 Topaz GS 4 door for about 8 years, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive dependable domestic used vehicle.

It cost $5000 back in '92, and here's how I see the past years:

Dependability:  Pretty good, some minor problems like cold start sensor showed up in sub zero temperatures but generally starts and runs well all year round.

Gas Efficiency:  Not as good as any guide will tell you, probably more like 17/21 city/highway.

Cabin &amp; Trunk:  Trunk has enough space, mini spare is hidden underneath, pretty convenient.  Cabin is ergonomically pleasant for an 80's design, seats are comfortable, stereo is iffy but the speakers are great for factory installed, so all you need is a cd player with some power if that's something you're interested in.

Cost of operation:  Cheap, runs well on 87 gas, very low maintenance costs compared to other cars like GM.

Driving:  Can sometimes appear a bit slow on takeoff, but what can you expect with 96 horses.  However, it's a very large 2.3 liter 4, so it feels like you have plenty of power and torque, and the gear ratios are good, especially in a snowy winter (read: can get out of any snowbank or mud in 1st gear).

Overall, the Topaz has served me well and I recommend it.

Drive safely.
