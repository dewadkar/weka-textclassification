            I've always wanted a Saab. the cars appearance always stated you are different from the rest. I must say that once you own this vehicle you will not be disappointed. The car drives like Porsche.The pick up has incredible kick. The interior is extremely comfortable.(love the heated seats). The car is designed to drive in snow. Being I live in Ohio the car is equal to an SUV in bad conditions. My husband and I fight over who will drive it. The only thing part i can mention about the car is that minor parts seem to wear. For me it was the latch to open the passenger door. I've heard that parts are expensive, however I've never needed to fix a thing besides the latch. I highly recommend this car to ANYONE who loves to drive. It's just fun.<br><br>
