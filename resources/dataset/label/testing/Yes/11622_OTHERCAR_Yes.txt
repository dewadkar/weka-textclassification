                 The Chevrolet Suburban is a pleasure to drive.  Before I had a Suburban, I thought that it would drive like a truck but I was WRONG.  It drives like a nice heavy car.  I feel very safe when I am driving or riding in a Suburban.  It is very easy to control on the road.  We use our Suburban for long trips and everyday, around town travel.  It serves us well in both areas.
     One concern, before buying the Suburban, was the gas mileage.  It hasn't been as bad as I thought.  In a normal month I usually only have to fill up the 42 gallon gas tank twice.
     I would recommend a Chevrolet Suburban for anyone who needs room to haul children, sports equipment, groceries, etc..., and still wants comfort.<br><br>
