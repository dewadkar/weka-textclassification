            Well,it was a tough month, I turned 30 and we bought a MINIVAN!! But not just any minivan, the 1999 Toyota Sienna XLE. I NEVER thought that I would be seen behind he wheel of a minivan, but as the mom of 3 little boys, it was much needed! The design of the Sienna is just about perfect!! The two sliding doors ( one automatic ) make it easy for little ones, and big ones to get in and out of. The seating is amazingly comfy and plush!! While inside the Sienna it appears to be a luxury vehicle not a minivan!! Nice surprise!! The drive is incredibly smooth and quiet while still having some wonderful pick up and go! This minivan is definitely the Mercedes of minivans in my book!<br><br>
