<TEXT>
            I'm a young married woman who was getting her first new car. I didn't want to spend alot but I wanted reliable and nice looking too. This is my 2nd Toyota Corolla &amp; both have been wonderful cars. They are inexpensive to maintain &amp; in 2 1/2 years, I've never had a problem with it. I got the automatic, power locks &amp; windows, CD player. 
I've tried to think of something I don't like about it but I can't really come up with anything. Once I have kids, I'll likely need a larger car but for now, this one is perfect and attractive. 
I love the little extras: big glove box, sunglasses tray, extra cupholder in the back plus 2 in the front, coin trays, subtle CD player, etc<br><br>
