            The Chevrolet Camaro stepped up into the real world of performance when it introduced the Camaro SS several years ago.  Ford took the spot light several years ago when it introduced the re-designed Mustang.  Well, enthusiasts can breathe a sigh when they drive the SS.  It has all the brawn of the reveled Corvette, but at a more affordable price.  The price of the SS fully equipped can reach the mid $35,000.00 range.  The performance of the 350 V8 with the factory aspirations deliver muscle unrivaled in its price range.

The acceleration of the V8 is incredible, especially when it is combined with the optional six speed manual transmission with the Hurst shifter.  The shifting is very smooth and it is geared very well.  There is plenty of power to spare in every gear.  Even when your just highway cruising in six gear, there is plenty of acceleration to pass and easily manage the likes of road hog trucks.  But when you need a hearty getty-up and go, there is always fourth and fifth gears.  Absolutely incredible!!  In fact, I found myself having trouble keeping control of my foot starting off in first gear.  So, I start off in second just to keep myself in check.  Besides, second feels like first gear in other 300ZX's and Mustangs that I have driven before.

The SS comes in various styles such as hardtop, convertible, and t-tops.  The funnest in my opinion is the convertible.  I would pick the most expensive choice of the three!  It's a trait that I have developed by shopping with my wife!!  Anyway,  the interior is reasonably comfortable and relatively easy to manage.  The steering is taut and firm, yet gives you a great feel of the road.  A lot of that is provided by the 17&quot; wheels and tires, that provide a firm grip on the road.  The interior is completed by the Monsoon stereo system.  Absolutely terrific!

The greatest thing in my opinion about the whole car is the deep throated exhaust system.  It's great to her yourself echoing between the city buildings as you calmly excellerate and maturely manuver between obstacles.  Yeah right!!

Go test drive one yourself.  You'll see!<br><br>
