            Well, much to my amazement, this car is the best car I've had.  I bought a 1991 Ciera that had been part of a corporate fleet.  It was well maintained.  And believe me, it is a charm.  With 140,000 miles on the odometer, I still feel like I am driving a new car.  The interior is so roomy and comfortable.  All the big people I know have no problem maneuvering in this vehicle.  The cigarette lighter even works!  The suspension and steering make me feel safe.  No problems there.  I've had this car a year now, and am contemplating buying a new car......the same model, only newer.  The paint looks good, as opposed to those other older cars whose paint is peeling.  I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone trying to purchase a used car.
