            After having photography experience using SLR's, and most recently my personal Olympus C-5050Z, the criteria would be hard to fill for finding a decent performing camera for my wife.

My criteria in looking for a new digital camera included:

1.  Portability
2.  Ease-of-use
3.  Quality photographs up to 8x10
4.  Use of standard (non-proprietary batteries)
5.  Good low-light performance
6.  Fast lens
7.  Manual controls

Out of all of those 7 points, I'm pleased to state that the Kodak DX6440 met all of them.  Let me explain:  

  The camera itself is portable.  Being small and lightweight, it has no problem riding in a pocket all day long without being obtrusive and bulky.  
  The camera also employs Kodak's menuing system which is very easy to use and understand right out of the box.  Every function was easy to find and navigate to by using Kodak's dial and joystick interface.
  Picture quality is above-standard, utilizing a Shneider-Kreuznach lens (a maker world-renowned for it's quality optics), and a 4 megapixel CCD sensor.  This allows for usable prints up to 8x10, although Kodak states higher.  In my experience, the image starts to degrade past a 12x18 enlargement, showing pixelation and vignetting.
  Battery choice is also abundant.  I have never been a proponent of a camera using proprietary batteries, such as most Sony or Fuji units.  The Kodak DX6440 will use CRV3 lithium disposables, lithium AA, Ni-MH AA's, or the Kodak Ni-MH battery pack.  I've used standard AA's in this camera as well, but battery and camera performance was not up to par.  I would NOT suggest using standard AA's, and neither does Kodak.  I would instead recommend the use of rechargeable 1700maH or higher Ni-MH batteries.  This will save you money over time, plus provide longer run times.
  Low-light performance is surprisingly capable.  Sporting a fast f2.2 lens, dark-light images come out fairly well, with little noise or chromatic aberration.
  The ability to have creative control over the camera is a nice addition with Kodak's manual PAS control functions.  Aperture, ISO speed, shutter speed, and focus are among the differnt manual functions which could be called upon by an experienced user.

Now apart from those 7 points which I described above, let me give you a general description of the overall camera itself.

The unit weighs in at around 12 oz with batteries, without batteries, Kodak claims a weight of 7.8 oz.  The quality of construction is also superb, being comprised of mostly polymer or ABS plastic.  It is tough, able to respond to the usual jars or shocks that most users would encounter.  The camera's eyepiece also includes a diopter adjustment, especially useful for those with poorer eye-sight or require the use of glasses.  The 1.8" LCD does a decent job performing indoors or outdoors, although in extremely bright sunlight the image tends to wash out, typical of most LCD screens.  The camera also does come with the EasyShare camera docking station 6000.  A usefull but unnecessary option, it provides one-touch photo transfers to a PC, plus automatic charging of the Kodak Ni-MH battery pack included with it.

The bad stuff:

This camera has a lot going for it, but it also has some troubling points.  First of all, the images tend to be less sharp than most 4MP camera's in its price-range.  Picture resolution when viewed natively on a high-resolution monitor, or when printed out with a quality printer such as the Canon i850, tend to be softer, showing more picture aberrations than other units.  Some vignetting is also an issue, but not as bad as other cameras in its class.  The battery door also feels extremely flimsy, and is under ALOT of pressure, especially when utilizing a CRV3 battery.  I would be extremely careful about swapping batteries, as I'm sure the door could break quite easily.

Well, apart from what you've read above, that's most of the cons.  If I have forgotten to mention something, I will update my review in the future.  For now, all I can say is that this is a great camera with many features in its price.  You would be hard-up to find something comparable without having to spend at least a hundred dollars more.
