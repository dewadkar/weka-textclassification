            When I was shopping for a compact luxury car a few months ago, I considered all of the top names. After driving a 1992 Saturn SL2 for 8 years, I figured I should have fun test-driving. So I made visits to Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, and BMW before making a decision to buy the BMW.
While the A4, C240, and IS300 were all very nice cars and each had their pros and cons, the 325i gave me the Ultimate Driving Experience in the Ultimate Driving Machine. With smooth handling, a powerful yet quiet acceleration, sleek styling and a luxurious interior, I was smitten before I had even gone a mile into my test drive.  BMW has created a vehicle that was designed not only to get you from point A to point B, but also to have fun while doing it. 
Before I give my opinion, I should place a disclaimer that I am not a maniacal car aficionado but rather that I enjoy driving just as much as the next person out there and will try to give you an informative, straightforward objective opinion.

<b>325i vs 323i</b>
BMW changed the name on this entry level sedan, as well as changing the 328 to 330, to more accurately reflect the engine size. The 2.5L engine remains the same as the 2000 323I, but a couple of engine tweaks and adjustments have squeezed out an extra 14 HP (170 to 184) for the 2001 325. Aside from that, the design remains the same, as does everything else, including the price tag (fortunately). 

<b>325i and 330i Differences</b>
For those of you deciding between the 325i and the 330i, I did get a chance to drive both cars while shopping. While the chassis (E46), inline 6 cylinder engine, and handling are identical, the 330i does offer more horses and a 3.0L engine (2.5L for the 325) as well as a few styling differences (note: BMW has retained the award-winning E46 design introduced in 1998 for 1999 production). However, I made a practical financial decision that the 41 extra HP (225 vs 184) and half liter were not worth the $7,000 tag difference. My opinion is that the 325i supplies more than enough power to please even most avid driving enthusiast and that I could use the extra money for those luxury options.

<b>Speaking of options�</b>
I opted for the premium package  - which if I remember correctly includes cruise control, power glass moonroof, auto-dimming mirror, myrtle wood trim, electric seats with driver's side memory, front armrest, auto climate control and an on-board computer (not the GPS). I have yet to use my cruise control because I do a lot of city driving but I find the other options well worth the money. The wood trim adds a nice luxurious effect and the auto-climate is very convenient. I don�t have to keep fumbling to keep the temperature in the car comfortable. I also opted for titanium silver metallic exterior. BMW charges you an arm and a leg ($475) for this option but I took the bait. The silver was just too pretty. I also opted for automatic transmission and black leather which might cause some true driving fans to wince� but the practicality of an automatic w/ steptronic was the way I had to go and what can I say � I love the smell of leather (yes � even for $1500). One package I do regret not getting is the Sports Package � I�ve heard great things about the 17� wheels and sports seat as well as the suspension. At $1500, this may be well worth the price tag.  I stayed with the factory CD sound system and have found that very competent and adequate. With 10 speakers located throughout the car, I saw no need to upgrade to the Harman Kardan system and have so far been pleased with my decision. Other notable options are xenon headlights (which I find annoying on other cars) and foglights (recommended). One thing to note is that the base cost of the 325 is a reasonable $27,000  - however options run up very quickly and take the car well into the $35,000 range � so consider the options carefully and make sure to get what you want.

<b>Styling</b>
In the 3rd year of production for the current design (E46), the current style is on target to outsell the very popular E36 (1992-1998) model by millions � meaning that the design is well liked. Why mess with a good thing? If it ain�t broke � don�t fix it... BMW intelligently didn�t change the design for 2001 (and how could they when the 2001 M3 is coming!). The smooth lines, the front grille, and the distinct look still define and epitomize a top-notch luxury car. Even the standard 16� alloy wheels stand out among cars of its class. From the interior, the dash is set perfectly with European controls that are quite intuitive. The multi-functional steering wheel allows control of the sound system and cruise control. Unique to the BMW, the center console is angled slightly toward the driver as this is most definitely a driver-oriented car. And the red glow of the night dash adds a mystical quality to the car. The one complaint that all critics of compact cars have (hence this is why we call them �compact� cars) is the roominess in the backseat. My advice to them is to go buy a minivan. You aren�t buying a BMW 325i to take the spouse and kids on a vacation. It�s a sports car � so critique like one.

<b>Driving (handling, acceleration, performance)</b>
If BMW can justify its hefty price tag compared to other cars of its class � this is where it�s done. While some other cars that I test drove responded quicker and went faster, none put them together so well as the 325 did.  I have taken my car around hairpin turns at 60 mph and just felt the car hugging and pulling at the corners more tightly than a baby hold its blanket. Sometimes it feels like my car is drawing a line on the road � that�s how smooth it is. Even with my automatic, I have jumped off the line at a red light (using steptronic of course) and felt the 175ft-lb torque rush through my body. The steering has lightened a little from last year (I drove the 323 as well) but still responds instantly to the slightest of movements.  The brakes are magnificent  - as a matter of fact C & D recently tested and rated the 325i�s brakes as the best of its class among 6 other highly competitive compact luxury cars. Supposedly, the governor is set at 129mph. Being from Virginia  - I have not yet tested that limit but at 110 mph on the NJ Turnpike going to visit the parents, the car still purrs like a kitten at barely above 3500 RPM. Be careful � this car was born to be driven fast. Driving it the speed limit is like keeping a tiger caged its whole life (btw � This is not an endorsement to break the law.)

<b>Safety</b>
Safety equipment the 325i includes All-Season Traction (AST) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), along with dual front airbags, door-mounted side airbags a Head Protection System (HPS). New for 2001 is Dynamic Brake Control, which reinforces the driver's effort during emergency braking. 

<b>Maintenance</b>
In what is perhaps my only gripe with this car, the maintenance issue can end up being a problem. The BMW is loaded with so many automatic and electronic functionalities that the likelihood of something malfunctioning is magnified in this car. Low and behold my car � after having it for a month only, the ELECTRONIC steering axle sensor broke and I had to get it replaced. The dealership said it was a freak accident but that still didn�t quite comfort me. Otherwise, the warrantee and service program is 3 years or 36,00 miles. All routine service is free, so quite a bit of money can be saved here.

<b>Pricing and Haggling</b>
I saw a big discrepancy between the way dealers treated me. Overall all of the salespeople were kind, but some were a little condescending toward my age. Being that I was 25, a lot of them didn�t think I was serious about buying a car like this, but I quickly solved that by bringing in my brochures of the Audi A4 and Lexus IS300. That got their attention rather quickly. Some salesmen wouldn�t budge from the MSRP, stating that they could sell the car to someone else in a heartbeat if I didn�t want it. Others were a bit more accommodating and I finally haggled a guy from $34,490 MSRP to $33,270, which I realize is still above invoice � but I was happy with that price. I will say to never settle for MSRP � that someone will always come down from it if you just speak nicely and cordially. It also helps if you could get a quote from a different dealer to show them. That could also help them to come down in fear of losing you to another dealership.
