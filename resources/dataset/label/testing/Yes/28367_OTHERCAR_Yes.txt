            I recently bought the 01 s500 with the sport pkg(a AMG-designed front spoiler, aerodynamic enhancements and 18-inch AMG Monoblock alloy wheels). It's built like a box car and it hugs the road like a Porshe. This car is loaded with safety options including dual front airbags; front and rear side airbags; head protection curtains; Automatic Slip Control (ASR); Electronic Stability Program (ESP); an anti-lock brake system (ABS); and Brake Assist. The security system qualified me for the best discount available from State Farm ( only $400.00/6 month premium).  Other options include dual-zone climate control, power windows and door locks, an integrated information and navigation system, TeleAid communication system, leather seats,  and a Bose ten-speaker sound system. It also has Nappa leather seats, burl walnut trim including steering wheel and gear shift knob and xenon high-intensity headlights. The motor is a powerful 302 hp V-8 which will throw your head against the seat on fast take offs and offers quick acceleration from high speeds such as interstate driving. This car is amazingly smooth on the rural roads where I live and the stereo is inspiring.  Buy this car used with a few miles on it and save big over the $91,000.00 sticker price and avoid the luxury tax which will have already been paid. This is my second S class with the first being a 1993 S320 which actually offered more protection from outside noise due to the the dual paned side windows(no longer available on this car). I especially like the navigational system which offers verbal commands through your stereo and can literally take you anywhere.  The air-conditioned seats are nice too on long trips in the summer.  I purchased the black/black S500 and the color adds to allure of this car.  If it's the financial aspect that bothers you don't buy it as there are better deals for your money; like a vacation home or a 3 bedroom ranch.  This car speaks volumes about the level of success you may have achieved.  Me, I just like the car and I enjoy driving it.
