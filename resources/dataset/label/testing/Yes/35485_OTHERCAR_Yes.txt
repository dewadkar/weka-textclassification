            My family was looking for a Mini-Van that would stand out from all the rest, something out of the ordinary, and we found it with the Odyssey. While the Chrysler Town and Country was a strong contender, Honda's reputation for quality put it over the top. I had read about this newer design before it ever hit the showrooms, and I must admit that I was practically sold then. But after seeing it up close and personal, woe! I was hooked like a tuna.

While there were several features that drew me to the Honda mini-van, the performance was very important to both myself and my wife; there's none faster than the Honda with its 210 hp VTEC engine. Because of where we live we always seem to find ourselves on the interstate on-ramps, and with the traffic clipping along at 70 mph+, we had no desire to be road pizza so we wanted something with guts. We'd test driven the other vans and many of the configurations seemed very sluggish. The Honda makes an awesome growling noise as the engine unwinds with the 4 speed auto-matic, and even at 85 mph you can punch it and it still goes into passing gear. There's plenty of power to spare once you notice that the Speedometer goes up to 140 mph (my wife won't let me push it, but at 90+ it's a smooth ride and you know there's more where that came from).

It comes with factory A/C front and rear (with a rear controller that lets you choose heat even while the front is pushing cold air conditioning), and all of this with individual air vents above each seat. The Rear seat folds into the floor, and when it's up there's a convenient well for your groceries that keeps them from rolling around.

Adjusting the seat after my smaller wife has been in it is just a bit uncomfortable since the lever is not right there at the door, but inwards so I have to lean over the seat to reach it but it's a small inconvenience to deal with. And I do not look forward to changing a tire since the spare is in a concealed well in the center of the van, but as long as it's not raining I suppose it's a small price to pay to have the fold down seat area where the spare usually resides. There is a minor squeak from the dash, and one of the two sliding doors sticks a little,... minor problems.

You won't be sorry with the Honda. I was told that the typical used car on the market retains 15% of its original value after 5 years. The Saturn is next with 25% after 5 years, and the top of the line in the resale market? The Honda with 40% of its original value after 5 years. (It was a Saturn Salesman that quoted me those figures a year ago). This weighed heavy in our decision to go with a mini-van that people were already lining up to buy, something that would draw buyers to itself should we decide to sell in the future. Go with the Best of the Best.......... buy a HONDA.<br><br>
