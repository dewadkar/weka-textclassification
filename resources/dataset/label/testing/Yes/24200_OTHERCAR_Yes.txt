            I recently used a Sony DSC-S30, and have the following comments:

Plusses:
- The camera is relatively inexpensive.
- Nice inclusion of USB and power adaptor + software in an inexpensive model.
- Memory stick technology is cool, if you own other sony devices.
- Takes larger memory sticks (64 meg, for example), which can hold TONS of pictures.
- Easy to access as a disc drive from Windows (with USB support).  Makes it easy to transfer images to your computer (or even store files on the camera!)
- Nice slideshow in the camera!
- Easy to delete pictures you don't want.

Minuses:
- Only comes with a 4 megabyte memory cartridge.
- Not a very high resolution (you pay more for that).
- Not as good lens technology as some other cameras.
- Battery life could be better; battery is rechargable, but not terribly long lasting.
