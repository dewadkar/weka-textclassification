            ~ ~ This new sports model from the British manufacturer Jaguar, the S-Type Sports, made its first public appearance at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy in December, 2000.
This is the car that Jaguar (now a Ford-owned subsidiary) hope will endear them to the more youthful buyer, and manage to lure them away from competitors such as BMW and Audi.

~ ~ The S-Type Sports was the model in this range that the Jaguar designers really went to town on.
At first glance, the first change that really strikes you is the now totally chrome-free body that serves to give this car a much �beefier� road presence and a far more menacing appearance.
It comes in a choice of five exterior finishes, with the bumper inserts, the number plate mountings, and the grille surround now all colour-coded.
A unique bonnet badge and a striking set of 18-inch, seven spoke BBS alloy wheels highlight even more its sporty characteristics.

~ ~ But while the new S-Type Sports is unquestionably lovely to look at, it is the modifications by the Jaguar engineers that have really rung the changes in this model.
There are two engine choices. The 3.0-litre V6 (240 bhp) or the 4.0-litre V8 (281 bhp).
Both have been tuned so as to deliver power rather than torque, with the car really coming into its own at the top end of the rev scale.
The smaller-engined 3.0-litre V6 comes with a manual gearbox, and hits the 60 mph mark in less than seven seconds, going on to a top speed of 146 mph.
The 4.0-litre V8 comes with an automatic box, and has a 0 to 60 mph time of only 6.6 seconds, and will carry you to a top speed of over 150 mph.
However, it has to be said that Jaguar have done nothing to radically modify the engines or to reduce the car�s overall weight, with the unsatisfactory end result that the S-Type Sports is actually no faster than the standard versions of this car.

~ ~ There have been some dramatic suspension modifications however, that set the Sport apart from the rest of the range.
The new suspension system is called CATS (Computer Activated Technology Suspension), and is fitted as standard on the 4.0-litre.
This really stiffens up the ride, and practically eliminates any body roll on corners at high speed, while at the same time the actual ride quality has suffered very little as a result.
The new �speed proportional� power steering system is also a huge improvement on the standard models, and gives much more feel and feedback to the driver.
The car sits very snugly on the road on its grippy tyres, but the brakes could have been improved upon, as they tend to lack both power and feel for a performance car.
It is possible to drive the car very �energetically� however, and it really eats up the road when pushed, and allows you to attack corners with gusto.

~ ~ The interior also has been modified somewhat.
The seats have been given added support, but the rear seating is barely adequate for two fully-grown adults, and the boot space (trunk) is very small and limited.
The front seating is very comfortable however, with 8-way electrically adjustable leather seats and an adjustable leather steering wheel. Full climate control adds to the comfort.
A new and very attractive dark maple wood finish has been added in the cabin, that was first used on the XKR Silverstone, and which enhances the sporty theme beautifully. It�s only a pity that this effect is spoiled a little by the over generous use of cheap looking �mud grey� plastic on both the centre console and the dashboard, which overall has a rather cluttered and confusing layout. 

~ ~ One last little crib.
If Jaguar really intended the S-Type Sports to appeal to the younger car buyer, then they really should have fitted a good quality sound system and CD autochanger as standard, rather than as optional extras.
Prices in the UK start at �30,900 for the 3.0-litre, rising to �38,400 for the 4.0-litre Auto. (American buyers consult your local dealer)
While Jaguar maintain that the modifications to this car represent good value� I personally feel that it�s a bit on the expensive side for its young target audience.
Many will be inclined to wait for the introduction of the X-Type, that is due to hit the showrooms sometime in the Summer of 2001, with an entry level price of around the �22,000 mark for the 2.5-litre V6.
