            Finally.

After waiting for months, IT has finally arrived.  That being a production date on this vehicle.  This car is not for ordinary car people.  This car has had a cult following long before any one showed up on a dealer lot with an MSRP sticker.

I had only 2 days to test this car, and trust me my Esso speed pass car monthly bill has never been that high ever!!!  I literally went through 4 tanks of gas testing this thing.  And these are no Dodge Neon-sized gas fills!!!  But rather the fill of an large American luxo/performance car.

Worth mentioning is that this car is equipped with the SVT Mustang's Cobra's DOHC 4.6l and not the 5.4l SOHC V8 as originally thought (as seen at the 1999 SEMA show).

The change was caused since Ford engineers realized that the 5.4l was simply too tall and could never fit in the engine bay without the use of high (read ugly) hood bulge.

Motivated by a 302-hp 32-valve DOHC V-8, this 5 passenger transport arrives this upcoming summer (2003) as an 03 model.  This car is based on the vanilla everyday Grand Marquis however this version has an underhood secret.

That being it has a Mustang GT like exhaust sound, with a heavy duty torque converter tucked into a four-speed automatic.  I wish they could have fit the 5 speed auto from the Explorer, oh well!)

Inside there is racing style instrumentation, including a 140 mph speedometer (km instrumentation in Canada of course), a 7000 rpm tach, temperature, oil pressure gauge, and a voltmeter.

Moreover these dials are all white backed and very easy to read.  They remind me of the dials found in a Mustang.  They really do have an aftermarket look because of the font used.  The radio is standard Ford fare to say the very least.  Still a step below the best Chrysler radios in overall faceplate design simplicity.

With regards to ride, this beast rolls on a rather firm suspension with fat 18 inch tires which are then mounted on nicely sculpted chrome alloy wheels.  These steam rollers are really worth the cash.

It is worth mentioning that all springs, shocks, and stabilizer bars all are unique to this car (NICE).  I am not sure about the disc brakes though.  I am not sure what car from the Ford parts bin they came from.

To ensure deft acceleration numbers this Merc is equipped with a 3.55:1 rear axle.  Coupled with the limited slip ensures the car will indeed launch with the appropriate enthusiasm best described as an "ol' kick in the pants".  This car is fun to drive.  PERIOD.

During my time with this car, I drove it over all types of roads surfaces, and I should mention that the car handles quite well for a full size car.

Overall the best way to describe this suspension is firm and taught.  A stark contrast to a normal garden variety Merc.  I would say 65% performance, 35% luxury.  The car is quiet by Ford standards, but loud by Lexus standards.  I think the quitest car I have ever been in is an LS430.

The car is level and firm when pushed, somewhat reminds me of a... ...dare I say it?  ok ok it reminds me of an BMW M5 with regards to feel.

I guess it will feel like an M5 as long as you refuse to look down onto the dash board, where you will then be reminded that you are indeed piloting a Merc. but do not fret, this ain't grandpa's ride, by any means.

When pushed into a corner the understeer can easily be controlled with a tap of the gas, but be careful as the tail end of this merc can easily be lost with incorrect steering input or too much gas.  

Inside the material choices are ok at best, but most customers who will buy this car, will not care if the inside was furnished in 60s vinyl.

This car is about the engine first, and everything else next.  But it does not hurt that the interior overall is really well done and thought out.

Furthermore, the leather used in this car is not like the hides used in other luxo cars.  Here I am comparing these surfaces to those used in Cadillac's or Lexus' (or is the plural Lexi?)  The surfaces in the Black Merc, are definitely harder and slippier.  (read not soft)

Ford spent the money on what lives under the hood, not what lives (your butt) above the seat.  And rightfully so.

The switch gear is nothing special, and the car does not come with in-car navigation.  As if potential drivers of this car would really care, as the money saved here would directly go to the next set of tires.

Finally, I would like to mention that this car has very few options (dealer installed cd player) and you can have it in any colour as long as it is black, black, or black.  Talk about choices!!!  No Ikea colour palettes here.

I guess "low key" is the theme here.  As only true car 'men' will recognize this 'sleeper'.

But not to worry Ford has promised that two more colours will be added on to the colour pallete later on during the model year.

In conclusion, if you are a customer looking for a somewhat alternative ride in terms of luxury, love American V8s and their related history, this is your car.

Just as long as you don't mind waiting in line for I am sure Ford will sell each and every one of these cars.  No doubt.
