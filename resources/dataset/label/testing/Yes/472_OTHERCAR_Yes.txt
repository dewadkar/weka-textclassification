            In Nov.'98 I bought a 99 Z34 for approx. $22K.  I bought the car because it had the largest engine (V6 3.8L-200hp) and it had the highest "top of the line" options (leather and elec seats, sunroof, cd) in its class/price range.  

The all black body, sleek lines, polished wheels and red bow ties (coming and going-as the Chevy ad men like to say) were all reasons for me to buy the car.  In comparison, I didn't like the smaller engines in the same priced Chryslers, Japanese and foreign cars.  It beat the comparable BMW in specs but did not have the garish unnecessary moldings of its sister Pontiac Grand Prix (a slightly more powerful car).  Finally, I liked the look and feel of the car inside.  The gauges, the all black color scheme, the muted yet aggressive look and feel are purely personal but clinched the sale for me.  

On the negative side, I did not notice the lack of headroom (due to the sunroof) until I brought the car home and it lacks in some minor amenities (only 1 cup holder, not many storage nooks, etc.)  It also has slightly too much wind noise when the windows and/or sunroof are open.  Other than that, I love the car.  

My kids, though, would prefer if it had 4 doors.  The car drives fast and strong-stronger IMHO than my wife's BMW 740il!  It's ok on gas mileage (22-24 mpg for me)and after 40K miles has not been in the shop except for brakes and regular maintenance. 

I think the Monte Carlo is for drivers who want a powerful, sleek and economical car. If you are tall or need lots of room for more than 2, you probably should buy something else.
