            I've been using the s300 for about 2 months and I love it. A camera is only as good as when it's with you, and this one you can take anywhere.

I love the fact that's it's super-quick. Most digi cameras take a long time to turn on and start shooting with. This ones fires up quickly and lets you shoot. Plus it's quick between shots, even at the highest res.

The battery needs to be removed to put into it's charger, kind of a hassle. My advice is to buy two batteries.

The flash could use some more juice. And the battery can not be replaced by AA in a pinch, so plan ahead.

Software is good, stitching option and movie option are great!
