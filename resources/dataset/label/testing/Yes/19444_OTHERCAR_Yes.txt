            If you work hard for your money, then you should consider the Mazda Millenia S when you start shopping for a luxury sports sedan.

Introduced in 1995, this car has never achieved a cult following similar to some of its competitors.  But that is one reason I chose the Millenia S over cars like the Lexus E300 and Audi A4.  Although these are very worthy competitors, I prefer a bit of uniqueness in my automobiles.

How's this for unique?  Zero, I repeat &quot;zero&quot; recalls from the manufacturer since introduction.

How about the only car available with a 24-valve Miller-cycle V6 engine with Lysholm compressor and dual intercoolers pumping out 210 horsepower?

Or the list of features that you pay extra for on many of its competitors like leather interior, CD player, moonroof, 8-way power seats for both driver and passenger, 17&quot; alloy wheels and V-rated tires?

But beware, the Mazda dealership showroom is not as &quot;high-brow&quot; as some of the high-line dealerships like Lexus, Infiniti, and Audi.  Because Mazda knows they have to work harder for your business, they usually offer generous purchase rebates to help you make that final purchase decision.
 
Does it handle as good as it looks?  Absolutely.  The car is quick, agile and solid, and yet a comfortable cruiser on the interstate.  And with gas mileage in the 20's, you have a touch of economy, too.

Two final tips for serious car shoppers--if you can find last year's model in the dealer's inventory, think seriously about buying it.  The manufacturer's rebate is HUGE.  Also, before making your final purchase decision, use the internet to compare the prices of 7-year, 100,000 mile extended bumper-to-bumper warranties for your particular automobile.

Even though the Mazda S has a super-charged engine, the bean-counters in the extended warranty business have figured out that the car is so solid, so bullet-proof, and so dependable that their rates for the Mazda Millenia S are 30-60% cheaper than some of its competitors.

In summary, is the car perfect?  No, but what car is?  Everyone's taste is different and it is wonderful that there are so many excellent cars available.  But do you want value, luxury, sport and a touch of uniqueness?  If so, you definitely should consider the Mazda Millenia S.<br><br>
