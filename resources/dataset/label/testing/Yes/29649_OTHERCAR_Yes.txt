            Nissan Xterra 2003

An Award Winner.

After making its first appearance on the North American market in 2000 and having won many awards for best new SUV the Xterra is going strong. 

The Xterra is a very rugged mid-size SUV built on a Frontier 4x4-truck ladder-style frame.

Nissan is targeting the younger active generation with this well built 4x4 and cashing in big. Sales are soaring already and the future looks really bright for this affordable SUV.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

To me the 2003 Nissan Xterra resembles a Ford Explorer, it is a very nice looking SUV and it is ready to take on the toughest task an owner chooses.

This SUV is for the active going sport minded person. The interior has as many as 10 tie-down floor and ceiling hooks to keep your gear in place while traveling through rough terrains.  Plus two sets of interior clips to secure mountain bikes.

The roof rack made of aluminum is reinforced to and can support a much heavier load than most others, which usually only serve as a decorative feature. Plus a front basket is added to secure more gear while en route to the destination.

As you can read it is a SUV design not for only going back and forth to the mall or commuting to the office. This one is made to be used as it is intended.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Opening the driver&#146s door you immediately notice that this vehicle is not meant for the fancy type. Not that it looks bad; it is just that you will not find any luxury items such as leather seats in this one.

Taking seat in the driver&#146s position you will have an excellent all-around vision. If you plan to pull a trailer or a boat I would recommend secondary market side view mirrors. The ones that come standard are sufficient for the vehicle unless you are pulling a load.

The Xterra comes with an excellent selection of standard equipment. It comes with power windows, power locks and powers mirrors, plus tilt steering, an excellent AM/FM radio with a CD player included in your sound system. A rear window defroster for the northern owners and a luggage rack.

The Xterra will sit five with no optional place that can be added. The front offers the driver and passenger enough room while in the back seat the legroom is a little restricted.

From the driver&#146s position all the gauges can easily be seen and all the control buttons are within easy reach 
of the driver.

The exterior:

From the outside it is a very nice truck to look at, everything to me seems proportionate and fit well into place. The paint job for a truck is very good.

The curb weight of the Xterra is 4092 pounds, the XE model only comes with 15-inches wheel while on the SE model 16-inches wheel are standard. Since this vehicle is meat for the rugged younger sport minded generation, if you opt for the XE model I would definitely consider up grading either at the dealer or on the after market to 16-inches wheels.  

The standard towing capacity 5s rated at 3500 pounds, again something to think about depending on the load you plan to pull.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The 2003 Nissan Xterra is a pleasure to drive on the highway and quite acceptable to drive within city limits. Some who may not be used to SUV&#146s may find it hard to judge the rear space available when parallel parking.
