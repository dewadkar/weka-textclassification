            I'll have to say my first new car buying experience was downright horrible, and I resolved to never let it happen again, so before I bought this car I did what we all know we should do up front:

- read the press
- reviewed safety
- interviewed current BMW owners, tried their cars
- researched the car thoroughly
- only walked into the dealer to pay for the car I wanted

Up front I'll have to say that I was very happy to see the crash performance from the insurance institute on this one as good as the Volvos, and that after driving my friend's 323 I knew I wanted a BMW.  I wanted a M3, I couldn't wait 4 years.

I had a horrible experience buying my Jeep years earlier and so went the route of what www.fightingchance.com recommends.  Their method made the experience much better, I paid much less and the dealer loved the fact that I knew what I wanted already.

From the fightingchance profile I spec'd out all the options I wanted and based on the media, I knew not going with the 3.0 litre would be a mistake.

That out of the way I love this car (and my wife does too),
here's what you can expect:

- excellent handling
- sharp, but smooth acceleration
- an five speed automatic that's one of the best in the industry
- a sport mode on the automatic that's not very far behind the manual in acceleration, and makes traffic driving a dream.
- the ability to take 40mph turns on wet pavement at 80 (yes it scared the bejeezers out of me when I did it on accident).
- goodyear tires that handle the soggy northwest
- 4 wheel drive that makes ski trips a breeze.
- supple leather and some of the best seat adjustments I've seen (I'm 6'5" and I fit comfortably).
- standard child seat fasteners that make the wife beam.
- split 60/40 rear seats that add the extra trunk room when the "smallest in it's class" cubic feet don't cut it.
(believe me, it still fits all the groceries and goes to costco).
- Theft system that exchanges keys with the engine computer to verify before starting.
- Car keys that recharge their battery while in the car!
- prewiring that makes it easy to add all those upgrades you "thought" weren't worth the money until later.
- little thoughtful things everywhere, like a rechargeable flashlight in the glove box, set of standard tools in the trunk, first aid kit under the passenger seat, emergency road hazard triangles, redundant lights in the blinkers and tail lights in case one light fails!
- around 15,000 miles before you visit the dealer for an oil change (incredible!)
- service plan that includes _everything_ paid for on maintenance for the default warranty period, and reasonable cost for the 7 year 70k extension.

There's so much more, it is the only car I've driven that makes me yearn, yes YEARN to get in and drive somewhere.
I'll have to say that I'm thinking about giving up the jeep and trading it in on a 540 down the road.

I only had one bad experience with the car, and I believe it's just a manufacturing fluke, only three months after receiving the car one of my xenon head lamps failed.  I could still drive and see just fine with the sport lamps and day time running lights on, but it was annoying to have to take it in since according to the manual these lights should outlive the car before failing.  The computer did accurately reflect that the light was out.

I did find out some more information on the 330xi later on.  The first thing is if you order the xi with the sports package, the sports package is mainly visual and does *not* come with a sport suspension.  The standard xi suspension is what's included (which is kind of half way between the stock and sport).  My recommendation is that if you don't need the AWD for snow and such, then leave off the AWD option and go with the 330i or 330ci, and then add the sports suspension.  I'm sure dinan or some other aftermarket tuning shops will sell kits for putting some sort of sport suspension on a xi later on.

All in all, if you can drive the price down below MSRP get one!  You'll never look back.
