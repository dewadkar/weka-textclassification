            The Kodak DC-260 is a pretty good medium priced digital camera. It features some useful improvements over previous models (I'm comparing it with the DC-120), specifically, more standard memory, built-in wide angle lens, better software for downloading and reviewing photos, attached lens cap cover, easier downloading.

The DC-120 was a nice camera, but being an early entry into the digital camera market, I think it had some bugs that were partially worked out in the newer models such as the DC-260. Let me go over the specific improvements and features.

1. built-in wide angle lens - in addition to the zoom (which is very useful), this camera can also do wide angle shots. Though the wide angle mode is not equal to that of a regular wide angle lens, for most folks it would do for group shots or for close shots of small areas. However, if you need to do panoramic shots or need to get pics of the entire width of a room from a short distance, you'll need to get a wide angle lens adapter. The built-in wide angle, though, is still way better than not having it.

2. Lens cap cover - you may think that this is a minor point, but let me tell you, after losing a couple of lens caps, just having a cord attached to the lens cap is a big deal. It's one of those little &quot;low-tech&quot; things that can make a product much more convenient to use. The previous models came with a detachable lens cap that was easy to misplace or lose.

3. Software - the DC-260 came with better software for reviewing the photos in the camera as well as for downloading to a computer. 

4. More memory - our DC-260 came with something like 10mb of RAM. The older cameras came with something like 1 or 2 mb, just enough for a dozen medium resolution shots or a couple of high resolution shots.

5. Other standard features - built in flash, nice LCD screen on the back of the camera for reviewing/programming camera, good battery life (my opinion), nice size and feel, generally easy to use.

Overall a nice camera for the price.
