            While opting for relocation a decision was made to consolidate two vehicles for one. We were spending almost $1,000 a month on two car payments and figured we could save all the additional maintenance costs by simply owning one car. Since we both love Mercedes, we looked at and test-drove the Mercedes E 430 and were not impressed. 

Let me say that no one usurps the look and engineering of Mercedes.

The exterior is gorgeous and deceptive. While taking cues from no one, it seems rather large and accommodating. The headlamps are indicative of the traditional Mercedes style and really illuminate at night, thanks to the Xenon bulbs. The cool blue hue is both comforting and distinguished while adding safety to your trip. The colour choices available are quite elegant and do not really add too much to the price. 

To insure the accuracy of my Epinion, I visited the websites of both companies (mbusa.com and 4adodge.com). While exploring I found the E-430 closely compared to the Dodge Stratus in almost every way. Ok, I understand that you like the Mercedes concept; so do I. However, so long as an automobile is going to be my primary mode of transportation, I do not want to spend $50,000+ when I can get almost the same thing and save about $25,000. The decision depends on you and your tastes. Personally, I would recommend the Stratus and save the money for an S-500. (Unfortunately the S 600 isn�t available in the US, yet.)

One of the personal favourites of the E-430 was the integrated key/fob. For lack of better words or phrases, it is so cool! It seems to be an infrared sensor integrated in the dash and key/fob. Preceding this was a key that flipped out of the unit. Now everything is one assembly. How cool is that. You simply place the triangular shaped key in the recessed ignition. Only a half and inch is placed in the ignition itself. 

Once inside, I was shocked at the lack of space. It was relatively small thanks to an almost 2 � foot wide console. While able to accept only one cup (not a large one from �McDonald�s). Who gets the child size when on the way back to work from lunch? Anyway, Everything was very well set up. The fit and finish was in traditional Mercedes form. The instrument cluster is looking tired. Mercedes needs desperately to update that. Additionally, the audio, phone and climate controls might seem difficult to a first time MB owner. I suggest reading the manual, for your own sake and a lot of hassle. 

The only other complaint was the ride quality. Although the pick up is excellent, the ride isn�t nearly what I had expected from a Mercedes sedan. Maybe I am picky, but my Mother�s Chrysler LHS rides better. I don�t know that I would really care about the fuel economy if I had a Mercedes in the driveway, so I really didn�t pay attention to that. The other pricey item is the auto-start (aftermarket) is about $800-1,400 installed. Again, if I have a Mercedes, I probably have a garage, too. I do. J

In closing, hats off to MBUSA for their continuing efforts to create the most attractive and ballsy cars on the road; however, I believe that there should be more bang for the buck.
