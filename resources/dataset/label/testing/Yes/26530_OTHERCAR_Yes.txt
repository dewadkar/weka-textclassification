            Well, my wife and I just leased another S-10 extended cab for my 17 year old daughter, I drive a 1999 model. $2000 down and $199 per month inclusive of all routine maintenance like oil changes and tire rotations, plus less to pay for insurance, what a great deal for a young driver. She loves the truck, her friends think it is awesome and the biggest satisfaction is the added safety she is given over any affordable subcompact car. I know that you want your teenager to be safe as they take on the responsibility of driving, and as concerned parents, we sleep a lot easier knowing she has some added safety benefit driving around in this truck and with the cab size is limited in the number of passengers she can comfortably handle. Other good features are gas mileage is good, opportunity for speeding is reduced due to the fairly modest rapid acceleration performance and they can transport any furniture, appliances or electronics for their parents. If you are planning a vehicle purchase for your teenager why not consider this much safer and cheaper alternative to any subcompact that may be available in todays market <br><br>
