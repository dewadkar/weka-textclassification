            I recently purchased a 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and would say that I am very pleased with the car.  I purchased the vehicle based mainly on size, comfort, style, and economy, and would say that I am pleased with it's performance in all of these areas.  The car is very comfortable and roomy for the driver and both front and rear passengers.  Not one person has complained about space.  The performance of the car is excellent considering I purchased an LS model with a 3.4L V6 Engine.  The gas mileage is also excellent for a car of this size.  I get in the 35mpg range on a rather large vehicle.  I expected the car to be a lot more sluggish and less economical for it's size, but it did surprise me.  The car's style is very sporty yet elegant at the same time.  I get nothing but compliments on the look and style of the car.  The car is extremely smooth and stable.  It is a very fun and safe feeling you get when you drive this car.  I would have to say that the car is one of the best deals for it's price range.  You really get more car for your buck with this one.  The maintenance on the car is also excellent.  I have driven the car 10000 mi. in 3 months and had no problems at all.<br><br>
