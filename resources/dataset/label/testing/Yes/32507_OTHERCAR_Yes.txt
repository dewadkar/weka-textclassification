            First of all I want to say that I'm probably not the average type driver. Due to family considerations I need a four door sedan but I want to have fun when I drive. In reality I often push my cars hard so my comments about performance may not be relevant for a lot of people who are considering the A4.

The BMW 330 was my other consideration, however the list price was $5,000 more for comparable features. In addition, BMW dealers wouldn't negotiate much off list while I was able to buy my Audi for $500 over dealer cost. So the difference in price was about $8,000! BMW is definitely not worth the extra money.

The power of the 3.0 is adequate but not exceptional. The weight of the Quattro, which adds about 300 pounds, is the gating factor here. The engine torque lags a bit until you reach 2800 rpm, but after that it has plenty of kick for most situations. Audi could benefit from hiring some engine designers from Honda/Acura, they have the most impressive engines on the market. The A4 feels a bit heavy during sharp cornering due to extra weight of Quattro system.

I've had 3 problems with my car. The window lock switch on the drivers door needed replacing. An ignition coil needed replacing. And the memory seat module needed replacing because it did not synchronize with the key properly. Nothing major but still very annoying for a new car that seems like such a quality product.

I've owned my car since October 2001 and have driven 10,000 miles to date. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. The car is a 6-speed with leather, Bose, sunroof, Xenon lights (highly recommended), heated seats, memory seats/side windows. I didn't get the sport package because I didn't want to swap tires twice a year which is a must for New England conditions. However, I would consider the sport package if I had to do it again.

The car is fun to drive but it takes a while to get used to the Quattro. You can drive the car harder than you think but it takes some experience because the feel is different than a front or rear wheel drive. In the snow and wet pavement this car is unbelievable! The fit and finish of the car is excellent. The interior is second to none. Mercedes and BMW don't even come close.
