            I have purchased the 99 E46 323i sedan since 1998 ordering it before hand.  I am a former owner of the E36 325i and my love for BMWs have continued.  The car though a little less fast as the former E36 325i, larger interior, wood accents, and a five speed automatic makes up for the lesser speed (.4 Secs slower in acceleration due to heavier weight).  The car also carries the new double vanos engine not available in the old 3series.  What seperates the 3series from other competitors such as the Audi A4, Volvo S40, and VW Passat V6 is that it carries a larger displacement pulling power from its naturally inspirated engine.  I am considering only german competitors because it is obvious American cars are no match unless you are going for the cheaper car and cheapy interior.  The Audi and Volvo relies on turbocharged power which in the longrun wears faster.  Cold starts and hot shut downs wears down the turbo and the engine itself.  As for the Passat, it is also a good car with slightly more value versus price, but I like the more aggressive look of the BMW 3series.  
What I like most about the car is its swift acceleration and true beautiful sound whistled through its engine.  With more such as the best handling and braking in its class, a leather interior with wood accents, need not I say more why I love it.  A only better car would be a 328i or M3 for a lot more buck (in its class).  But for me with limited capital, a 323i would suffice.  I can always add an exhaust and air filter and modifications from the various tuners such as AC Schnitzer, Racing Dynamics, MK Motorsport, Hartge, Alpina, which solely modifies BMW's.  Driving this vehicle adds the joy of driving around especially to places as work where it might be less enjoying.  
The only reason for not buying one would be if you couldn't afford to maintain it.  High prices for equipment are to be considered, but I haven't had any problems.  So definitely buy one if you are looking for a sports sedan and have the money to spend.  Buy an M3 or 328 is you have more.  If you want more than that, go buy an M5.
