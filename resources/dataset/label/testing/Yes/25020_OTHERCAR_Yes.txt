            go round and round... yes we have all heard this children's song, and every time I ride in my mini-van, I feel like a bus driver, which isn't a bad thing.

I would have to say I love driving my mini-van (almost as much as my Dodge Ram or my Gand AM) Its nice and roomy, you sit up high, you feel in command.

We bought the minivan used, with about 20K miles on it. That was 5 years ago.  Since then we've put another 60K miles, and I'm happy to report, it hasn't had many problems.  Besides changing the usual, spark plugs, breaks, oil, etc.  We have not had to replace anything major, except for a few recalls, but they were minor things like the door hatch in the back might open, and your kids might fly out.. but...

We've moved two of my brothers into college with this beast of a minivan.  We've packed all kinds of stuff into it, refrigerators, wood for lofts, microwaves, speakers, you name it we've put it in.  The shocks on this thing are incredible, fully loaded it rides like a breeze.  There is one complaint however; the back seat and the two seats that you can remove are difficult, and often hard to remove, to make extra space, without 2 other people.  But with that aside, the hauling capability is extraordinary.  

The controls, the lights, the blower, the radio, are all positioned nicely so as not to make it difficult to drive while, lets say changing the station. The four captains chairs are comfortable, and have weathered long rides without much complaint.  The back bench, however, isn't as comfortable, and its a little straight up and down for extremely long rides, but for the soccer mom with 6 kids, its great to lug them all back and forth to school.

As for gas, it uses a lot, much like any other big car.  It gets about 13-15 miles per gallon, and it carries about 15 gallons.

Besides the few mentioned complaints, I don't have much to gripe over.  The Plymouth Voyager is a great car to drive.  If you were to paint it yellow, you could call it a bus, it can carry that many people... (It also drives like a bus... it is a BIG car.) I know I will be driving this for a while, and trade it off with more then 100K miles on it.
