            My friends laughed when I bought my 1995 Ford Escort LX station wagon.  It had only 38000 miles on it and more than serves my needs.  This solid little car handles fine, gives a comfortable ride with relatively low road noise.  The control panel is laid out well with the exception of the rear wiper blade control which is kind of hidden.
I feel that I got a great deal on such a fine car and plan on having this car for many years.
The only drawbacks that i can think of is the low resell value and if one is concerned with outward appearances, which I am not, the station Wagon may not convey the look that is wanted.
I enjoy knowing that I can fit lumber to build a bookcase in the back and take a road trip well supplied with the luggage in reach.
In my opinion this car is a reliable, useful machine that I Love!
