            Ever since I saw the movie "Ronin" I have been enamored by the Audi line. "Ronin" is by far the best car chase movie made in years, but that is another review. The bad experience several friends have had with the early 4000 and 5000 Audi lines have kept me from ever really looking at owning one though.  A former coworker owned a Quattro Coupe and often talked about the "S" cars from Audi. That changed the bad image I had about the cars and then along came the S4. From what I have heard the A4 line saved Audi and the S4 made me an owner.

The S4 is everything you could want in a car if you live in a four season environment. While I have not had a chance to drive my S4 in the snow I did take a friends 2000 S4 out last winter and this thing is rock solid. I have driven in pounding rain and gravel and never felt even the slightest spin or slide. The 250hp seems instantly available with the 6 speed and can really shove you back in the heated, very supportive, leather seats. But if you want the car can be very tame and cruise around town.

I had even put a deposit down on a Porsche Boxster thinking no other car would cover what I was looking for. Needless to say I went with the Audi. The S4 exceeds all of my expectations. Fit and finish is superb with everything lining up, trim is first rate and the paint is flawless.

For the price of a new SUV I have a all weather supercar. More fun to drive and probably much safer as well. Since I bought the S4 my SUV has been out of the garage one time. If you have a family the S4 is not the best choice but Audi makes the S4 Avanti wagon and next year the S6 Avanti. 

Enjoy...
