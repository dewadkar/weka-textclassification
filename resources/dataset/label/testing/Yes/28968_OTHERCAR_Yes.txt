            Some might think this opinion premature. After all, I've only been driving my new 2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS for about a week. But this is the second Hyundai I've owned and I bought this new one based on my satisfaction with the first, a 1997 Elantra Wagon.

The first thing I noticed about the Sonata is how roomy it is. The leg space in the front seat is wonderful. The dashboard doesn't feel like it's sitting in your lap. And from door to door, the space is more than adequate. In fact, it's almost luxurious. Also, the rear seat belts are quite ample. I'm a large woman and felt comfortable wearing the rear belts which normally are too binding.

I opted for the GLS model because I really wanted the power and oomph of a V6 engine. I do a lot of highway driving and felt I could use the extra power. On my way home from the dealership, a 100 mile trip, I experienced pick-up like never before--even though I had the air conditioning blasting! In fact, when I thought I was cruising along at about 65, I was actually going 75!

One big concern I had about moving from a wagon to a sedan was losing cargo space. I'm pleased to report that the trunk on the Sonata is very roomy. The squared-off styling of the trunk hood lends to greater height than I anticipated. And I don't believe I've lost even an inch of floor space.

I also opted for the option package 10 which includes a moonroof and a cassette player. (The car comes standard with an AM/FM/CD player.)

Probably the best thing I like about this Hyundai and my previous one is the stellar guarantee that Hyundai provides...10 yr/100,000 mi power train, 5 yr/60,000 mi bumper to bumper and a 5 yr/unlimited mile roadside assistance program. All at no charge. Just think...what you'd pay extra for with most other manufacturers is standard from or exceeded by Hyundai.

The only problem I've experienced so far with the vehicle is really my own...I have to force myself from driving past mirrored buildings just so I can see the car's reflection in it. <br><br>
