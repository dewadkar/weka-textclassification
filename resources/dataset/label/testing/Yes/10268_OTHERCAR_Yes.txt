            Last year I bought a 1997 Sentra for my teenage daughter.  It had been a rental car and had around 15,000 miles.  After a year it has been trouble free.  Just put in the gas (and not much of that), change the oil, and keep on driving.

The car I bought had only automatic, radio, and rear window defroster as options.  I drove it for three months and found it comfortable with good handling.  There is just enough power, but my daughter doesn't need a lot of power.  It's comfortable to drive, a great commuter car.

The thing that pushed me to the Sentra was the steel timing belt.  I had previously purchased a Toyota Tercel for my older daughter, and had just had to pay out $500 to change out the timing belt at 75,000 miles.  All the small Nissans have steel timing belts that will last the life the engine.  To me this is a real significant advantage for Nissan over most similar cars.

The other advantage that Nissan has is the super powerful air conditioners.  Even in 105 degree Texas summers you cannot run the Sentra's air conditioner full blast for long before you start to freeze!  It is really major advantage over many other cars of all price ranges.  Nissan really knows how to build an air conditioner!
