            The most noticeable feature upon first unpacking and grasping the camera is the layout of the controls. Everything is within a fingertip away, tidily arranged and not sticking out like an injured bollard. Unfortunately, I inherited my dad's bricklaying hands, which tend to swamp the camera and get in the way of the viewfinder. To everyone else with big, wide hands, I recommend the Kodak or Sony range of cameras.

The Olympus C-2020 has the unique ability to take pictures using three different modes: high-resolution full colour, greyscale and sepia (like an old photograph). This renders the camera marketable as an artist's as well as a beginner's tool. The powerful 3x zoom and 24-bit colour capture functions make this an attractive digital alternative to a traditional camera and the 2.1 megapixel performance competes well with the current crop of competitors. However, this is not the easiest camera to master if you want to take it out of the box and get started straight away. The accompanying manual is also very poor and doesn't really go into any depth about how the camera is supposed to operate. Pushing buttons won't hurt, so go for it. On the other hand, the camera's PC and Macintosh software installs quickly and is a breeze to use.

The C-2020 connects to the PC using a provided serial cable (no USB unfortunately) and lifts the images contained in the camera's 8MB SmartMedia Card with a minimum of fuss. Downloading to your hard drive takes quite a while, especially if you used the camera to film up to 60 seconds of QuickTime video. In which case, we recommend you order an optional AC adapter. Hopefully, Olympus will look towards USB connectivity for their next model, to enhance download times.
