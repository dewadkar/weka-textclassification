            Yea, I've owned a ton of them and there's no doubt Hyundai have a cult classic here. Anyone who even knows this car exists will most likely say they like it. It has the good looks of a European sport hatch back with a fraction of the cost and a heap more reliability.
Sadly, I have just traded mine in for a more practical pick up, but make no mistake, I would have kept it if I could.
----I owned the car for 2 and a bit years.
----I put 71,000 miles on it.
----It accommodated me and my girl, two bikes on the back, clothing, camping gear, food and sometimes a dog on many occasions.
----The overall finish was excellent.
----Good quality leather upholstery, carpet and floor matt's.
----Solid and tight doors and seals.
----Nearly enough power.
----Sweet accessories, cool dash lights.
----Front and side airbags.
----Nice alloys.
I could go on and on about the stuff this car does well. By now you've already read that in the other reviews. I couldn't add anything other than: Don't buy the extended warranty. It's a waste of money! If you keep up with the service schedule, (which is doable but not cheap) you'll have no problems. The car has some minor issues such as the brakes, fuel consumption and lack of power to back up the looks. However, all these things are pretty mute when you consider what you pay and it's overall reliability.
