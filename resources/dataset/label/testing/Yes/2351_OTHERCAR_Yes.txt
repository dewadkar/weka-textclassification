            Since the day I laid eyes on the Toshiba PDR-M4, I knew this would be the digital camera for me. At first, all I knew was that I wanted something in the 2 Megapixel range, was compact (could fit in my pocket), and was simple to use. I finally had a chance to actually pick one up and play with it at a local Montgomery Ward store. I was shooting in seconds. I never even looked at the manual. The controls were self-explanatory! Well, first I tried for a couple of weeks to get one on auction on Ebay. I could not seem to win! So, I researched and got an excellent price thru a merchant over the internet. I have been using this camera for over three months now and it is everything I could want with the exception of mechanical zoom. It has not failed to give me the highest quality shots, even in difficult conditions. Its speed is incredible too. I now have to fight to get it away from my wife as she uses it constantly for her Ebay advertisements. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a really great camera, but doesn't necessarily need a mechanical zoom. This camera is perfect for novices and the experienced. It is loaded with features. I recently purchased another memory card and a &quot;Flashpath&quot; Floppy adapter which really speeds up my downloads. If I had a USB port on my PC, I would have lightening fast downloads.<br><br>
