            2002 Volvo S40.  1.9T, auto, Premium plus, Cold Weather, Sport, Atlantic Blue exterior, Taupe interior.

We special ordered this car from Marin Volvo in CA.  They could not find this combo anywhere in the USA, so we waited 5 weeks for it.  It came in a few weeks sooner than we thought it would.  The dealer hustled it along so we could buy it and take it to Tahoe on a vacation 2 days after the purchase.

I must give Marin Volvo a lot of credit, they were superb through this process, and gave us a price of $500 over invoice.  They asked "how high?" when we told them to jump.  Ask for Steven or George.  Excellent experience.

Coming from a 95 Honda Civic DX, manual, manual steering was a big jump in luxury, performance, and safety when we got the S40.  This is my fiancee's car, but she lets me drive it sometimes :)

I'll begin on the outside.  The paint is a beautiful deep blue metallic.  The fit and finish is great...all the lines match.  The car looks very nice overall, though I prefer the look of the A4.  I do think Volvo should have included 16" wheels with the sport package.  The 15" wheels really look too small for today's sport "look" that is offered my many other car companies.  That is easily remedied once the tires wear out.  

The Volvo comes with cute, but quite unnecessary headlight wipers.  Fog lights are a nice bonus, and a rear fog light is ingenious.  4 wheel disc brakes are also a nice feature, and man this thing can stop on a dime.  I think the push-to-open trunk latch is a bit old school...but this allows it to be unlocked and locked with the remote as well as opened with the remote.  

Inside, the seats are soooooooo comfortable.  I love sitting in any seat in this car.  I am a 6 footer and feel comfy anywhere.  The backs of the front seats are scooped out to give another few inches of knee room, and it helps, but the front seats really can't be all the way back if there is an adult in the rear.  The good news is that I cna pull the front seat up and still feel comfy when in the front.  The front seats are heated, but the amount of heat is barely noticable.  This may be a defect, we will be taking it in to hav ethis checked.

The dash/console redesign from 01-02 is a big improvement.  The dash is the same, but the cupholder has been replaced with a small cubby hole, and the long unusable storage bin in the console has been replaced with 2 cupholders.  EXCELLENT MOVE, VOLVO.  The glove box is huge, and the info computer is nice to play with for MPG and temps.  THe steering wheel (upgraded) is very comfortable.  

The trunk is huge, and the rear seats fold down...also, the passenger seat folds completely flat, allowing a long item to be slid through the trunk, and all the way up to the dash.  Also, the center headrest in the back collapses into the rear seat, unlike the A4 that sticks up into the rear view.  

The front windows roll all the way down to about 1/8" sticking up.  Not a big deal but just one of the things I noticed.  The rear windows roll about 2/3 down.  They won't go any farther with the small doors.  The rear 1/4 windows are a great help for the blind spot.

This car handles like a dream.  The steering is super responsive.  I have never driven a car so precise.  The 1.9T provides more than enough power for this car.  Mash on the pedal and you'll go from slow - 60 in a few seconds.  Perfect for on ramps and passing.  And we still get alost 30 MPG.  Great for the 45 mile commute.  Shifting is super smooth.  One bonus is the traction control.  Its like AWD for 2 wheels.

The stereo is marginal.  Tuner is bad, and sound with windows down is hard to hear.  Turning it up leads to distortion.  I will be investing in some upgraded speakers and a new head unit.  Too bad for Volvo, they need to improve this.  With windows up and a CD on (or CD-r) it sounds quite nice.  Volvo selles a subwoofer for the spare tire area.  Probably a good buy.

This car is very safe.  Read the other reviews for this info.  Worlds better than the Civic.  I have a 2001 Tacoma Double Cab and the luxury, power, and feel of this car makes me very jealous of my girlfriend as we both commute 45 miles every day :)

Well worth the $28000!~
