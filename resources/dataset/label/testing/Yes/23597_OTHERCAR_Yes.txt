                I was one of those sceptics about this new car. You know "Lexus coming out with a supped up car to rival the M#?, no way it will never make it!" That was before I saw the Lexus IS300 on the cover of the 2001 edition of Consumer Reports best cars of 2001. I was intriged so I went to a dealership to test it out and see what all the talk was all about.

    I rode in the car and let me tell you, it was more like a sports car than a upscale luxury car. And why not? It has sport suspension. The car was fast as well. About 215 hp. The ride is firm and well controlled. It even has an automatic transmission that allows you to shift manually by buttons located on the steering wheel! I never tried that part out but it seems very interesting. The IS is a V6 so its acceleration is amazing. It also gets a respectable 21 miles to the gallon.

   The IS is meant to compete directly with the Mercedes C class and BMW's 3 series. And overall it beats them to a bloody pulp. However, handling is not as good as the mercedes or the BMW. Nor is it quite so spacious. The trunk is small and the back seats are almost not even there. But what do you expect from a sporty car like the IS 300? 

   This car is a must for all youth in America. It looks as though i may sell my old car and get this one. Any Lexus car that has the bravery to have rear wheel drive and sports suspension while marketing itself as a luxury car demands attention.
