<TEXT>
            I didnt buy this car, Ive only test driven it a many times.  I Drove a 1999 nsx-t before getting my Viper.  A Nsx is a good car, but its not the best as many think of it.

ACCELERATION
If the name of your game is acceleration, dont get an nsx.  They do have good acceration, 0-60 in the mid 5 seconds, but they dont have what it takes to be a drag racer, like a porsche, or a Viper.  In the quarter mile the NSX's time is 13.8 @103.2, while a vipers is 12.7 @112.7.  And if you have the money to upgrade an NSX to the point of pulling 4.0 second 0-60 times, you could have a Viper that does a 3.5 0-60.  But it comes to a point where, if your not racing... do you need to go that fast? Only if you have some friends on the Police force.:0)

HANDLING
While the strong point of a NSX is its cornering, a porsches still beats it out.  The NSX still has superb handling, just slightly less then a porsche, but the NSX has alot more room then a porsche.  Compaired to a Vipers turning the NSX is much better.

PRICE
This is what kills the NSX for me, it comes with a big price tag for what you get.  An NSX costs 80-90k, Where its compeditors, Viper 65-75k, Porsche 80-130k(depending on what kind) and Corvette @ around 50k

INTERIOR
I think the nsx has the nicest interior, its like a luxury car inside, with all the options you could ever want.  Others are nice, but dont compaire

MY OPINION
So over all I decided if i was going to spend 90k for a car that could turn, I would get a Porsche, faster and better handling, but smaller.  But I only had 60k for a car so I cut a deal with my local Dodge dealer on a Viper.<br><br>
