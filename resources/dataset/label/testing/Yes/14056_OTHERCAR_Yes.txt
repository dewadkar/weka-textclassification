            I rented this car for a for a long distance trip.  Driving from Baltimore, Maryland to Charleston, South Carolina.  Spending 5 days there. Then from Charleston to NY City for 3days the back  On the highway this car got great mileage.  Night Driving was a breeze.  The rear view mirror has this reflection dimming feature with show motorist headlamps as green.  No glare what so ever.  I found the lumbar feature in the seats to be and asset in long distance driving.  To my dismay this car dismay this car did no have a CD player. Ample trunk space and leg room.  Great leather interior.  Champaign Body and Tan interior. The heat was great up north and the air fantastic in the south.  I loved this ride found parking very easy.  I did think the side view mirrors were large and hard to see over for a petit person life myself 5'3'' with power seats.  

Inner-city mileage really sucked.  For instance on my way to Charleston I re-fueled once.  In Charleston I had refueled twice.  In five days.  Altogether I spent $133.32 on gas for the week.  Yes, I went on a long trip.  However, that was why I rented a car.  Comfort A+ from me.

Keep in mind that my I opted for an economy car with a coupon for an upgrade with Budget.  I lucked up and ended up with the Grand Marquis.  The only other cars they had in stock was the 2000 Jaguar and Mustang.
