            Less than 2 weeks ago, we bought a 1999 Daewoo Nubira CDX. I had done quite a bit of research on cars within our budget and have to say the the opinions expressed at this site really helped to narrow the field. We were very surprised at the performance when we test drove the Nubira CDX. It can really get out there and drives more like a sports car. This little gem came fully loaded with an impressive gas-and-go guarantee. It has tail lights even a blind man can see and the whole family was impressed with the amount of room in the trunk and cabin its self. We haven't had it long enough to figure the gas mileage, but it has to be better the the truck we traded in on it. I have shown it off to several co-workers and  one has already been out to test drive one. If you need or just want a well outfitted, nicely appointed car at a decent price, check out Daewoo.If you want more and have a bigger budget, run (don't walk) out and test drive the Leganza CDX. Your neighbors may be astounded that you've bought a car they've never heard of but that will change!  I really believe they will be making a name for themselves in the next few years. Yes, we also hear &quot;Daewoo---Daehoo?&quot;, but the joke's on you. 
I got &quot;fully loaded&quot; everything that you had to order and pay for extra!
     I wanted to add a little bit here, we took the car to Bend OR this last weekend. It's about a 3 hr. drive over a couple of mountain passes, the highest a little over 7000 ft. My husband put the car in 5th and kicked on the cruise control and we took all the curves and the passes with no effort at all! He was really impressed.
