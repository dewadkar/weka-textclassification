            Love the viewfinder, and the fact that you know IMMEDIATELY if you got a good pic so you have the opportunity to re-shoot. 

 Not the highest quality so far as pixels go, but definitely good enough.  I have used my pics for email, web pages, and prints. 

 Does use a LOT of batteries, 4 AA's at a time.  But if you cut down on the reviewing or do the reviewing with the ac adapter plugged in it cuts down significantly on the battery use.  I've even been known to wander around the house with a very long extension cord attached.  

Does only offer the LCD viewer, but in my experience, you don't need the regular viewer.

 Works best in good, natural light and less movement.  

I haven't used a regular camera in over a year, since I purchased this camera.  No film, no processing.  I used to have loads of film to take in at a time cause I didn't get around to it.  Now I can process, crop and print pics in MINUTES from the time I take them.  

Overall, a GREAT camera, especially if you are just starting into digital photography and computers.  Great software that comes with it as well.<br><br>
