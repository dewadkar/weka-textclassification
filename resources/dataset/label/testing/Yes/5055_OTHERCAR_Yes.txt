            I recently bought a 1990 Subaru Loyale COUPE with a rear spoiler. The car is great, even though it isn't turbo charged. It has an automatic transmission, power door locks and windows, and all around is a very reliable and nice car. I would recommend it to anyone. The car is very comfortable, very roomy, and gives a very quiet and reliable ride. It always starts up first turn of the key, and even though it needs the ECS checked, it always runs perfect and is full of power. Even though I dislike the automatic transmission, it does run and switch gears perfectly. Though they rust quickly, it still has a lot of life left in it with only 65 thousand miles.<br><br>
