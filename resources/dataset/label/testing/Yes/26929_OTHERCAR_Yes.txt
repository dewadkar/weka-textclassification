            I am the proud owner of a 98 Camry LE and I just love it. I had a Celica until recently and you could not have gotten me away from that car with a crowbar, but a Blazer managed to reduce it by half and the insurance company would not repair it.  However, that is another story entirely, but I got the Camry after the Celica was wrecked.  It is Dark Green with a Tan interior and Gold accents.  I bought it used from a private person and it had only 54,000 miles on it.
This car gets excellent gas usage and I drive it back and forth 30 miles each way to college, and everywhere my eight year old needs to go.  I live in a rural area, so I have to do a lot of driving from place to place and gas mileage is very important to me.  It has the quietest and smoothest ride of any vehicle I have been in lately.  This car is responsive and truly a pleasure to drive.  I feel that my daughter and her friends are very safe in the back seat (It does have side passenger air bags), and the interior is comfortable and accommodating.  
It also satisfies my other needs as well.  All of the gadgets and controls are very well within reach and designed for easy driver access.  This car was truly designed for the driver and the stereo is excellent.  The CD player and cassette system are incredible and the sound system is really excellent for a family car.  The bass will make the seats vibrate if you get a really good song on.
I would recommend this car to anyone and plan to buy a brand new one when I can get the funds. Judging from my past experience with Toyotas, I expect this one to perform just as well in the service department.  My past Toyota only needed regular maintenance checks (oil,tire rotate,brakes, etc.) and so far the Camry has performed equally or better that I expected.  Take a test drive, you will be very surprised and find out that it is definitely well worth the money.
