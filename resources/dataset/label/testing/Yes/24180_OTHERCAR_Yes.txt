            If you are looking for a Great Medium-Priced Range camera. The SONY DSCS30 is a great camera.  We researched many brands of cameras before deciding to buy!  We bought ours online through mobshop.com, it's a group purchasing site.  Our Price $469.00, plus tax &amp; shipping.  I have seen this camera at Circuit City, Best Buy and Wal-mart, all going for about $499.00.  You can also check DealTime.com to see who is running the best deal on it!

This camera has many great features.  One of the most important features my husband wanted was the fact that it could take close-up pictures to about 1.2&quot; away from the object!  So if you want detail, such as in a ring or a mineral specimen, you can get so unbelievably close, that the smallest object in your photo is in great detail, and you can blow it up even more when you zoom in.  The 1.3 million pixel photograph that it's capable of taking is spectacular and shows high detail.  Now this is not as great as their higher priced cameras, which have 2.3 million pixels and 3.1 million pixels, but it is just great for our needs.

Another great feature is the 2&quot; screen that pops up out of the back of the camera and is used as the VIEWFINDER!  This digital screen can turn a full 180 degrees and YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, if you choose so.  It shows and plays back the photos you take in great digital detail.  There are various controls on the back of the camera from Zoom to paging through the pictures back and forth, deleting, and editing pictures. Some of the buttons are very small.

With the screen on the back of the camera, you can snap a picture and then ZOOM IN ON IT 6X DIGITALLY! It also features a 3X Optical Zoom.  This camera comes with a 4MB Memory card that slides into the side of the camera.  Now, that doesn't sound like much, but listen to this...you take a picture, ZOOM IN a little bit, click the shutter button, the camera has just resized your photo and saved it at a smaller size, therefore, you can take more pictures and save them.  My husband started only being able to take about 4 pictures, but has mastered the technique of reducing the size and saving again, and deleting the original picture using the features on the back of the camera.  Now he fits from 19-24 pictures on that same 4 MB.  Now you can purchase extra Memory Sticks for this camera, again check DealTime.com to see who's running the best deal!  The sticks come in 4MB, 16MB, 32MB, 64MB, 128MB.  There is also another accessory you can buy from Sony for this camera, it's a 3 1/2&quot; disk that the Memory Stick slides into, (IT'S A DISK OPTION ADAPTER), and then you can put it into your 3 1/2&quot; DISK DRIVE on your PC, and retrieve your pictures that way!

Now the one feature that my husband doesn't like about this camera is that it has about a 1 second delay when you press the shutter button down to take the picture.  I've used the camera a few times, and it really bugs me too!

You also have a flash option of Low, Normal, or High setting to get that picture as bright as you require.  Now, don't forget about the Time and Date Stamp, he hasn't used it yet, but I think that it's a great feature, it's just that this camera does so much...you have to remember everything!

You can take a picture up to 1472 X 1104 resolution, which takes up a lot of memory, but it's definitely a precise, clear picture with spectacular clarity.  Remember not all pictures have to be taken at that resolution!

On top of the camera next to the shutter button, is the STILL and PLAYBACK mode switch.  To take pictures, keep it on STILL and when you would like to look at them, SWITCH it over to PLAYBACK and you will be able to review the pictures you have taken with the controls on the back of the camera.  Make sure you read the ENTIRE instruction book before using this camera as it has many FEATURES you will want to know about.

It comes with a Infolithium Battery and an A/C adapter cord included, we just plug ours into the wall to recharge the battery...a truly GREAT feature.

They also supply you with a connecting cord to hook up into your USB port on your PC, a removable DRIVE icon pops up, and you click on it to retrieve your pictures, make sure you downsize them if you are going to email them to friends and family.

ENJOY THIS SPECTACULAR CAMERA!
Thanks for reading!
