<TEXT>
            We bought our 1998 Ford Windstar new.  It now has 84,000 miles on it and will have driven it four years in September.
It has served us faithfully.  It has a comfortable ride and
yet is very spacious and roomy.  We have used the luggage
rack on top to carry a few things but nothing really  heavy.
You can easily take out the very back seat within a few
minutes or you can just fold it down for more room.  The
middle seat also folds down easily.  We can carry a total
of seven adults comfortable with all of them wearing their
seat belts.  One my complaint is that when you use the pull
out cup holders in the front dash and have anything in the
small holder between them-you are going to hear a little rattle.
