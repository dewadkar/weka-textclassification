              I've had cars by Ford before. For the most part my experience with this particular vehical is little different than with those. The motor runs well so long as you keep up with it's care. (And heaven forbid your attention should ever lapse.) It handles most weather and road conditions well. My chief design complaint is that, as is typical with most sedans, is that they are not built for taller people. My sight is limited and I tend to have to crane my seck around just to get a view of the road I am trying to turn onto.
  My other concern with this product is the durability and reliability of its parts. Even small children can make short work of the flimsy cup-holders. The cables for the power windows are weak and the control panels for the windows are not properly installed.
  All in all I would rather buy a car that is certain to last. Though not a BAD car, it has much to be improved upon.<br><br>
