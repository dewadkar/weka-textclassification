            The Mercedes Benz ML 320. What more can you ask for? It's got the quality name brand and the reliability you want. Mercedes is a name you can trust. This fine German automobile is a little steep in price, but when dealing with Mercedes Benz, you get what you pay for. However, the ML320 might be a Mercedes, but it is clear that it is a truck.  The ride is somewhat smooth, but you really feel like your in an SUV; which is good if your willing to spend the money. Although if you're looking for a SUV that rides like a car and feels like one too, than I would suggest the Lexus RX300. The ML320 has a powerful 3.2 litre V6 engine with a 5-speed automatic transmission that can really haul for a SUV. The ML is also available in a 4.3 litre V8 version, but that is quite expensive. Although the ride is not as smooth as one would want, the handling and acceleration are superb and really bring out the Mercedes Benz name.  Inside the ML, there is plenty of space in the front as well as the rear and now available are two seats in the far rear of the vehicle to make the ML seat 7 passengers; good for car pools and commuting. However, the leather is not what it should be and the dash and door panels are lacking the Mercedes feel. the leather is a little thin and hard while the door panels are plastic as well as parts of the dash.  When you're paying this amount of money for a Mercedes no less, one would expect more luxury. Overall, good looks, good engine, good name, poor interior design, great handling, and plenty of room.<br><br>
