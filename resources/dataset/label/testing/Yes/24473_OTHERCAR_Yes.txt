            I bought the car about 2 years ago with 106K miles on it. This car was well taken care of by the original owner and had a full service record at the local infiniti. 
The car always brings a smile to my face. It has timeless styling that still turns heads although the design has now been around for 10 years. Ford Taurus and Pontiac Bonneville both tried to copy it but their products were far less impressive to look at. The interior styling of the Infiniti reminds me of the XJS-HE Jaguars.
The car drives very smoothly and has adequate passing power. Off the line it is a bit slow, close to 9 sec. 0 to 60 time that can be attributed to the weight and gearing. This car is very heavy and that is one of the reasons for smoother ride but low fuel economy. I changed spark plugs, all filters and switched to Mobil 1 synthetic oil and now I get 18 city and 25 Hwy... not bad for a car with over 120K miles on it.

Problem areas to watch for when buying a J30 are:
Transmission slippage ( usual culprit is owner neglect )
Sticky/stuck Sunroof ( known problem with J30's. )
Bose Speakers with Built in Amps
Infiniti/Clarion AM/FM/CD/Cassette Head unit
Rubber suspension mounts
Window regulators 
Door latches and automatic locking mechanisms.
Mass air flow sensor
Headlight relays

If the above are working well, then cars are usually a steal and well worth the price.

I like the J30's because they have:
Plenty of passing power
Very comfortable seats for long drives
Styling
Quality of workmanship
Can be bought fairly cheap
Rear wheel drive for crisp handling, especially good with the stiffer 93 and 94 T models with HICAS (4 wheel steering )

The shortcomings are:
Electronic Gremlins
expensive parts and repair
road noise

I have owned and driven a lot of quality cars and the J30 is inferior to none of them. I like them even more than the new I30's. I was in fact disappointed when Infiniti dropped the rear wheel drive platform and went to the Maxima based I30 but with the introduction of the new G35, a true and worthy successor , the spirit of J30 lives on.
