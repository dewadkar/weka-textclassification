            I am a former Jeep Wrangler owner.  Let me start by saying I loved my Jeep.  A Jeep, however, is definitely not a luxury vehicle.  They're kind of noisy, especially with the soft-top or no top, but that's OK by me.  You feel the road and all its little imperfections (although the new Wrangler suspension didn't knock your teeth loose like the old ones).  However, more important than any of that, the Jeep is a FUN car.  A lot of fun.  BUT, and this is the big one, for someone who was about to have a baby (and now has that baby, he's wonderful thanks!), there is not enough room for all the stuff that goes with a growing family.  So the toy had to go.

And so began the search for a small/mid size SUV that would still be kind of sporty but would have enough room for all of the trappings of new baby (car seats, strollers, luggage to go visit grandma, etc. etc.).  Price was also very important, as those diapers can add up pretty quick.  :-)  I wanted to stay in the $25,000 range with as many options as possible, loaded being ideal.

I looked at a number of SUVs.  Here are my thoughts on each:  
Honda CR-V - my number two choice, but not nearly as sporty, and a little smaller.  The automatic drove like a minivan, but the manual was nice.  Price was good (slightly less than Xterra).
Ford Escape - First impressions are everything, and I didn't like it.  Drove OK, but it looked like a miniaturized Explorer.  I like the Explorer look, but the mini-look was strange to me.  Like I say, first impressions are a lot, and this one didn't make the cut.  Price was comparable to Xterra I think. 
Mitisbushi Montero Sport - More expensive, and not quite as sporty looking as the Xterra.  Didn't drive it as it didn't make the price cut I was looking for with the options I wanted.
Toyota Rav-4 - Felt smallish to me (I'm 6'2" btw).  Price was OK, but I felt like I was paying too much for the name and not enough for options that I wanted.
Toyota 4-Runner - Too expensive, didn't make the cut.

Now for the Xterra.  I drove a lot of Xterras.  I believe I test drove 5 different cars.  I drove mostly automatics and found them to be very comfortable and adequately powered in the V-6.  I did drive one of the Supercharged V-6 / SE's, and to be honest, the increase in power wasn't as dramatic as I'd thought it might be.  In addition there was a constant hi pitched whine from the supercharger along with normal engine noise.  All of that plus the fact that you have to put premium in the supercharged engine and pay an extra $2500 for it eliminated it from my options.  I'm buying an SUV after all, not a race car.  The manual transmission was OK, but even though I like manual's I decided it would be nice to go back to the easier to drive automatic.  Plus with the manual tranny, you lose some towing capacity.

XE vs. SE - I drove both, and decided quickly that the SE came with the options that I wanted, and if I added the basic options I wanted to the XE, I still ended up at the same price as the SE.  The SE was close enough to my price range that I guessed (correctly) that I could haggle my way down to it.  

Comfort, Ride, noise, etc. - The Xterra rides fairly well.  You still feel a lot of the bumps in the road, and it can be a bit shaky over some of our lovely winterized Ohio roads, but overall its comfortable enough to commute to work in and to go on long trips as well (we've already taken it for a 3 hour (1-way) tour of the grandparents houses around the state).  Its fairly quiet, wind noise at highway speeds can be noticeable, although not intrusive.  Its very comfortable for me as a driver, and my wife was comfortable in the backseat, even with the car seat in the middle position in the back.  The car seat fits in OK, but with the front seats all the way back, the car seat hits the back of the front seats.  I can sit however, in the back seats even with the front seat all the way back, and while my knees touch the seat, I'm not jammed in.  Credit the raised rear seat for that, a feature that I really like.

Gas mileage - I'm still breaking in the engine, so my gas performance has not been stellar yet.  (14 / 17) I'm also going to have the front hubs checked to make sure they aren't sticking when out of 4wd and degrading my gas performance.  

Off-Road - I had to run it out in the dirt a little bit to get a feel for it. It feels pretty solid off road and the 4-wd high and low options are both effective when called upon.  I don't think I go banging through the dirt and trees like I did with my Jeep, but if I get into snow or into less than favorable terrain, I'll be very confident in the Xterra's ability.  I had a salesperson that told me the Xterra could shift to 4wd hi on the fly up to 40 mph, but when I tried it in an early test drive (not the car I bought), the gears were grinding.  So I did a little checking and the Xterra is actually only rated to shift on the fly at 25 mph (40 *kilometers* per hour, silly salesman).  Regardless, I'm a little disappointed by that, because I had occasion in my jeep to shift at 50 mph when I hit a slick spot on the highway.  You don't need it all the time, but its nice to be able to shift to 4wd at higher speeds when you need it.  

Storage - This was a biggie, and the Xterra doesn't disappoint.  The roof rack, and front storage tray are nice, and I look forward to using those for stashing extra luggage for longer trips.  However the trunk provides more than adequate room for a hockey-sized duffel bag, a camera bag, a backpack, and a jacket.  I used the numerous tie downs in the back to hold most of that to one side of the trunk, and then I put my dog (a 40 lb black lab mix) in the back on the other side, leaving her with plenty of room to lay down and be out of the way.  Wife and kid in the backseat for the long trip, and that leaves space for even more inside storage in the passenger front seat and back seat behind me.  For once, I didn't have to duct tape the doors shut to keep everything in the car after coming back from (very-generous) grandma's house.  ;-)  Add to that the fact that you can fold the back seats down almost flat and the very wide opening provided by the tailgate, and this is a true utility vehicle.  (I'm a little disappointed by the fact that you have to remove the rear seats to fold down the seat backs, but I can deal with that little oddity.)

One last thing.  The SE comes with a 6-disc in dash CD changer with a great radio (Rockford Fosgate) and 8-speaker sound system.  I love this thing.  The noise and time it takes to change between discs is a little annoying, but manageable.  The sound though is fantastic for both CD and radio, and the radio comes with a travel preset feature.  This allows you to push one button when you get out of range of your home channels, and it auto searches for the most powerful signals and temporarily sets them as your presets.  Return to your home and you simply turn off the travel preset and your original settings are automatically restored.  Travel further and lose the temporary signals, simply turn off the travel feature and turn it back on, and you get the channels available in your new area.  Very cool in my book.  Simple pleasures are sometimes the best ones of all.
