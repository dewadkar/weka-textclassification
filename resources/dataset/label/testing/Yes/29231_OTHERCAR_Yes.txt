            As a father of 2 with one more on the way, I thought I would be relegated to buying some econobox for my next car.  I commute a minimum of 50 miles a day to work so I have always tried to have a vehicle I enjoy driving.  I have always liked the looks of the Protege5 and with a $2500 rebate and an additional $500 incentive now became the perfect time to buy.

I purchased a red manual transmission with only a cargo net and wheel locks as options.  Believe it or not - finally a vehicle that comes with floormats standard!  The dealer sold it at $3000 below invoice or almost $4000 below MSRP.

First the inside: The Protege5 is a fully loaded car by most standards.  It has power everything - remote entry, power mirrors, good stereo with CD plus a subwoofer hidden with the spare tire. The seats are roomy enough for a 6 footer and the driver seat is very comfortable and supportive.  Two can ride comfortably in back with room for a third for short trips.  The seat materials are very tastefully done and appear to be durable (though time will tell).  The rear seats split 60/40 to increase the overall cargo space if needed.  The only color option inside is off-black which is great if you have kids (anyone with a tan interior and little ones knows what I mean...).  The controls are quality and well placed, with nice brushed metallic accents.  The only thing I thought the interior lacked was a better center console.  The center console has two built in drink holders - but don't supersize cause the larger drinks may not fit (maybe Mazda's way of saying Americans are fat..).  The center armrest is also basically useless as an armrest as it is too low and too far back.  A coin dish or cell phone holder would also have been nice between the hand brake and the stick.  The glove box however is plenty big.  For parents - I put my daughter's large car seat in the back with no problem.  There is plenty of room to put your child in and buckle them up and tether anchors as well.  The seatbelts are also self locking.

The outside:  Car appearance is such a subjective thing so I will subjectively say these cars look great!  My wife says it is "cute", but I prefer "sporty" and "sharp".  Mazda has done a great job making an eye pleaser out of the Protege5.  I especially like the added side lights just in front of the front doors that will hopefully keep someone from changing lanes into you at night!  Alloy wheels are standard (no cheap plastic covers here!). I am also glad Mazda put a screw in antenna on the top of the car.  I have been driving a car with a broken power antenna for about 4 yrs!  The headlights are excellent and along with the fog lights really increase visibility at night.  I also read a consumer test that said the Protege had one of the best distance to glare headlights (meaning you can see really far and drivers coming the opposite way don't think you have your high beams on).

Performance and ride:  Most people want a sporty car to go fast.  Well the Protege5 only has 130HP.  Unless you are a speed freak, you won't care because this car is just plain fun to drive.  The handling is superb.  The clutch engages easily and the shifts are smooth.  This car makes you go looking for twisting roads.  Make no mistake however, you will feel the road more.  The car's Dunlop 5000 sport tires pick up quite a bit of road vibration and feed it back through the steering wheel.  They are an odd size too 195/50 R16 which may be difficult to find locally.  If you are like me, you will have so much fun driving this that the road noise won't matter.  Gas mileage could be better at 25 city/31 hwy for such a small engine.

The bottom line is they don't say Zoom Zoom Zoom for nothing.  This car is fun to drive and with the rebates now it will leave you smiling come car payment time.  But you had better hurry - this is being replaced by the Mazda 3 and what you see on the lots now is probably all they have left.
