            I was looking for a digital camera for one reason, selling items on line. I couldn't be more satisfied with the Sony MVC-FD 73 for this purpose. It makes putting a picture on line a breeze. If I had expected super 8X10s I would have been quite disappointed. I have tried other digital cameras with results varying from garbage to fair and for 8x10 or larger prints none, so far, have come even close to my Yashica with Zeiss lens', or my wife's Nikon with her Nikor lenses, but If you want to put a good clear picture on Ebay, it just can't be beat.  Mega-pixel resolution isn't needed, or even wanted for this. IT TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD.  I am completely satisfied with the MVC-FD 73 and would not even consider upgrading to a more expensive model Sony or any other brand.<br><br>
