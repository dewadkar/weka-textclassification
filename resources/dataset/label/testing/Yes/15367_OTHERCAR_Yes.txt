            I bought this camera after using my Mom's just like it.  I was actually able to pick up my Mom's and use it without ever reading the directions.  I was amazed at the ease of use and the great quality of the pictures.

You can set the camera to take high or lower resolution pictures.  The camera takes a floppy disk instead of a memory card, which I LOVE!  The floppy disks are like your film, you can take a pack with you and you can take plenty of pictures without having to delete them or save them on a PC from a memory card!  If I am using the lower resolution I can get about 25-30 pictures on a disk.  With the higher resolution I can only get 9-10.  I love the floppies because there is no plugging the camera into a computer, you just pop out the floppy and pop it in the PC!  The picture quality is wonderful, when I want prints of any pictures, I upload them to photoworks.com and have prints made.  They come out perfect quality.  I do not have a color printer of my own, so I have not tried printing them myself.  I have taken so many pictures and sent them over the Internet and posted them to our family website!  This is a great camera!  You can also easily view a picture you just took and delete it or keep it right then and there!

Another awesome feature is the movie maker.  I can make a 5-15 second movie and send it over the Internet to anyone.  On Mother's Day my husband and I recorded a message to our Mom's and sent it to them via e-mail.  They loved it!  I also recorded my daughter in her band concert and sent that to her Grandma's, so they didn't miss out!  

The battery life is not very long, but you do have the option to purchase a longer battery.  So far I am fine with the one that came with the camera.  It comes with a charger and I just plug it in when I notice the battery is getting low.  

I can't recommend this camera enough.  I love it and I think it is a must have for everyone with kids!  <br><br>
