                My mom bought a toyota paseo brand new in 1992.  It is a very sleek and well designed car with good control and speed for a 2.2 liter fuel injected engine. It has a sporty spoiler and lots of trunk space as well.  I was very excited to ride in her new paseo for the very first time.
    Well, several years have passed and my mom still own her toyota paseo to this date.  It has around 135,000 thousand miles on it and runs like the first day we bought it.  It has only had a to replace minor things like headlights, tires, a new battery, routine maintenance. She has never had to replace any major parts on the car.  Also the car's interior is still looking in good condition and the body is in good condition.
    I will have to say that this car has only a few bad points if any at all.  First the seating compartment is a little cramped in front a little and the rear's head clearance is way too low.  The factory radio and speakers is also very cheap and broke very early in the cars life.  The only other thing that I can think of is the front and rear compartments there were hardly no cup holder and where there was one you had problems with the ashtray.  There was also no ashtray in the rear.  The seats are also a little uncomfortable because there was no cushion to the seats at all.
    I have to say that this car's gas mileage is also a plus.  I figured that this car was getting 40 on highway miles and 45 on interstate miles. And it was one of the most smooth rides I have to ride in yet.  
    If you are a single person going to college or buying your first car this car is for you.  If you are looking for something a little roomy I would look somewhere else unless dependability, gas mileage, and sleek style are more of a plus for you.  Consumer reports rates this car one of the best cars on the market for its time.  Thanks.<br><br>
