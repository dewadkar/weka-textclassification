            We actually purchased and returned 3 or 4 other cameras before finding the Toshiba PDR-M700.  The others were all lacking in some or multiple ways.  The only real knocks against the Toshiba is the autofocus takes too long to keep up with our toddler and I would prefer a stronger flash and/or a hotshoe.  

The flash is good for 10 feet or so, but much beyond that and it begins to get iffy.  In manual program mode, the camera does not seem to take the flash into account when setting the shutter speed though.  In such situations I just set it to shutter priority and set the desired speed manually and take some test shots to get the right affect. 

Focus speed is comparable to other digital cameras we've tested--maybe a hair faster than some, but that's still not saying much.  It's generally not too bad, only really becoming problematic after dark.  There are some fixed-focus modes you can select in manual mode, but they are not much use for taking snapshots of a running toddler!

The shutter speed and overall processing are definitely faster than other cameras we tested though, which helps make up a little bit for the slow focus.  

The camera does take good pictures--if you set it from the default ISO setting of "auto 200" to 70 or 100.  ISO settings of 200 and 400 produce noticeably more grain in the picture, as one would expect.  

Setting it to full automatic mode results in an easy-to-use point and shoot, although you do need to pop up the flash if conditions warrant.  (The viewfinder will warn you with an icon if the shutter speed is going to be slow.)

There is a good range of manual controls that seem to be effective and give you more control for those more difficult shots.  And the long zoom is *really* nice.  Not only does it let you get closer to distant subjects, it can allow for more creative composition even indoors.  

We haven't tried getting an 8x10 printed, but the 5x7 we had printed at a digital lab came out looking as good (to us) as a print from 35mm film.

A 256MB card will hold about 300 images at the middle quality setting.  I actually liked that setting a bit better than the "high" setting.  We've had the camera a bit over a week and taken about 400 shots outside and inside.

If the flash was a bit stronger, the focus a bit faster, or it had a hotshoe it would get 5 stars, as it is it probably deserves 4.5 stars.
