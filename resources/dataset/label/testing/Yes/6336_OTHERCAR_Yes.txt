            The Sienna is my fourth, but not final Toyota.  After my beloved Camry was totalled, we knew we were going to replace it with another Toyota, but until we test-drove the Sienna, I never dreamed I'd join the mini-van set.  The Sienna is built on a modified Camry wheel-base, so it feels a bit like my previous Toy, which is solid and smooth.  I love having 2 side doors!  I can't imagine how parents coped with climbing over the seats for carseats! UGH!  Speaking of the side-doors, I had to have the latches replaced, it was apparently a common flaw that they would "stick" closed OR open.  I didn't have any hassle with the dealership and was covered under warranty.  The only other drawback is that IMHO, they used cheap paint.  I don't notice other, later Sienna's, having the same paint probs I have with mine.  It just chips too easily.  I'll probably have to have it repainted in another year or 2.  We taken several long drive trips in it, and the whole family has been comfortable with room for luggage. We've used it to tow a few trailer loads and it handled just fine...plenty of power.  It also has good marks for safety.  As a first time mini-van purchase and a long term Toyota buyer, I've been very happy.
