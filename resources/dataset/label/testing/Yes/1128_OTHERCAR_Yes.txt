                 I recently purchased my first brand new car. I made the choice of a Dodge Neon only after shopping for like 3 weeks. I looked all over for a car I felt comfortable in ad drove well on the road. When I first test drove this one i knew right away that it was the car for me.
     I needed to buy a new car for college. I am from Massachusetts and I am going to Tennessee for college. I had a feeling that my 1985 Monte Carlo just wouldn't make the trip so i started my search for a new car. I looked for about three weeks at all different brands and models. I wanted a inexpensive car that rode well and was on gas. My choices came down between the Chevy Caviler, Ford Escort, and Dodge Neon. 
     After test driving all of the and talking with sales reps. I decided to go with the Neon. My first time sitting in the automobile I felt totally part of the car, the seats were comfortable, controls are not out of reach, the steering wheel was adjustable to your body, and I for one love the stereo system. I had to take the car for a spin just to check out its road handling and all.
     The car rode extremely well and you couldn't even tell you were driving a 4 cylinder car. It seemed to glide and took turns and corners just as smooth as the strait road. 
     This being my first new car i don't have anything to compare it to, but i will tell you this on my trip to college (from MA-TN) I had not one problem with the car and only spent maybe $40.00 on gas. The only other problem i have had was a recall on a PCV tube, but it was covered and was no big deal, except time. 
    This car is a good purchase for a first time new car buyer. It is very dependable and very good on gas. Its 30,000 bumper to bumper warranty comes in very handy, especially when most problems will happen under that amount. It also comes with 24 hour free road side assistance anytime anywhere. I am very happy with my first new car, it has been for me. I am a college student who does not have extra money to worry about having to fix a car or pay for more gas then needed. I would recommend looking at one if you want a inexpensive, dependable car.<br><br>
