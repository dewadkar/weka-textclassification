            I've been wanting to get a digital camera for years now.  But two things kept holding me back.  For one, it seems like the quality and available options seriously lag behind traditional film cameras.  Secondly, I don't take very many pictures.

Sure, I've always loved the idea of taking pictures.  I've always had a half-way decent film camera.  I buy one, use it like a madman for a while, and next thing I know it's sitting on a shelf in the closet gathering dust.

I finally decided to make the leap to digital cameras because I've always been interested in digital imaging and I'm tired of scanning pictures, and it looks like available features are catching up with film cameras.

I purchased the camera last December and have been snapping away happily ever since.  It's amazing to be able to snap a ton of pictures, erase the ones you don't like on the fly, and not waste money and time getting rolls of poor pictures developed.  Without the hassles of running out of film and needing to take film to be developed (only to find that 5 of the 24 pictures were any good), I haven't wanted to shelve this gem.

This camera in particular has been very good to me.  On the plus side, with the batteries in, it has a decent weight to it and is easy to grip.  There are a couple of add-on lenses available for it (zoom and macro).  It takes nice pictures in auto-mode and there are enough manual settings available to keep me pretty happy (although I can always wish for more!).  For manual adjustments, you can set the white balance, fstop, sharpness, and flash intensity.  In addition to the auto and manual settings there are pre-set modes for "NightScene","Sport",  "Scene" and "Portrait".  You can also adjust the quality from 3 megapixels at the highest down to 0.3 megapixels.

On the downside, you don't have direct control of the shutter speed, so "action" shots can be blurred even if using "sport" mode (or maybe I just haven't gotten the hang of them yet).  The view screen doesn't operate very well unless you're in a well lit area.  However, even if you can't see much in the view screen I find that if I snap the picture anyway (and use the flash), the pictures come out nice and crisp.  The memory card that comes with the camera is only a wimpy 16mb and you'll burn through non-rechargeable batteries like crazy if you use them.  I wouldn't waste any time -- buy two sets of rechargeable batteries and a charger when you pick up the camera.  I'd pick up a bigger memory card for the camera as well if you can afford it.
