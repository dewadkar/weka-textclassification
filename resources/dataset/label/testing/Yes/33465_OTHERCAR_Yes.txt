            A truck to most people is made for hauling large times or pulling a large trailer.  Nowdays, this is fast becoming a thing of the past.  Gone are the days of vinyl seats and am radios (which are still STANDARD on some ford models) and in come a new form of luxury vehicle -- the Chevy HD series.

First, the price is fairly reasonable, but can get really steep when optioned all the way to the top.  With optional power/leather/heated seats, the drive through the construction yard is more comfortable.  Not to mention the sound quality from the dual media stereo system.  Another neat feature is the power sliding rear window, not available on ford models.  Also available are the power window/lock/mirrors, and standard heated outside mirrors.  The selfdimming mirror is optional though, but it does provide a compass.

Even with all the luxury options, it still is a heavy duty truck, and will ride like one.  But it still is smoother and easier to drive than the ford counterpart.  And it offers probably the best engine/tranny combo in the business.  The 8.1 Liter "Rat" is back and now has a 5 speed auto transmission.  This combination provides more horsepower and torque than does any engine offered in other heavy duty trucks, including diesels.  And the engine tows more than most anyone could have use for.  This translates into suprisingly good performance even when towing.

This newly introduced truck is built off of the silverado platform which has served well these past couple of years, with no major recalls, unlike other manufacturers.  The strength of Chevy trucks has long been known.  The new HD series will carry this tradition into this milenium.  If this truck wasn't what Chevy promised it would be, Motortrend would have never named it "Truck of the Year", a title it so rightly deserves.
