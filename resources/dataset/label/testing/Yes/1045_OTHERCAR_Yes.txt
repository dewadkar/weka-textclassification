            The 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd 5.9 was the last of the monster V-8's from Jeep.  This engine is tremendously powerful with awesome pickup.  When new, the car could not go past any gas stations.  The mpg for highway driving was a horrid 11-13.  After putting on 6000 miles the mpg improved to about 18 on the highway.  The leather interior is lush and very soft.  The newer models do not have the same soft feel.  Jeep should bring this model back.  The comfort level is really outstanding. The storage space is good and a roof rack comes in handy for big loads. If you can live with the initial poor gas mileage, this is a great car and I recommend it. The visibility is excellent and the car is fun to drive.  <br><br>
