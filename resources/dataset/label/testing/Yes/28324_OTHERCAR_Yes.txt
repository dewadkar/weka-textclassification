            The Corvette Type 5 release is the apex of all General Motors releases and offers power, styling, speed, and design details that only foreign exotic imports can match.

I looked for several months to purchase a used Silver Coupe and even in Los Angeles, the car capital of the word, it was an effort. A new model Corvette would cost around $45,000 so I was glad to spend only $34,000 for a used model with 19 k on it. The car I purchased was as clean as a show room version!

If you should decide to go this route can you also save money by agreeing on a sales price to report to the Department of Motor Vehicles that is significantly less than your agreed upon purchase price. This mode doesn't cost either party anything. The best way to do this is to check for the Kelly Blue Book and take the lowest possible figure for wholesale prices and use this as your cost basis. That way you can substaniate your claim. You can save a bundle in car registration and DMV fees this way and each year your vehicle registration fees will be far less!

I have a moon roof on my car and I highly recommend this feature. Also you should consider avoiding the built in CD unit and buy an after market version. This component will cost a lot loss and offer you better features to boot.

Happy Motoring! <br><br>
