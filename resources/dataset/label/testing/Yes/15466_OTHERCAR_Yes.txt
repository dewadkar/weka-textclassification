            I bought the Mavica FD88 Because of it's picture quality, and the fact that it uses a 3-1/2&quot; floppy disk instead of a flash card, you don't have to run cables to your computer to download. You just slip out the disk and put it in your computer. with its 1024 X 768 image size I can print out clear, sharp 8&quot; X 10&quot; pictures that look as good as the best film print. The 16X digital zoom works very smoothly. One major draw back with the Mavica, is that it is very hard to find the accessories that don't come with it. I would like to get AC and DC adaptors for it so I don't have to use the batteries all the time. Also the bright light on top can be rather distracting. All in all I would say that the Mavica is a very good camera for anyone who enjoys taking pictures for fun or business.<br><br>
