            Let's face it, if you are planning to buy a convertible, there's a little vanity involved in your decision. You want to buy a car that not only looks good, but makes <i>you</i> look and feel good. Your care should elicit gawking from passers-by, and drooling comments from friends and strangers alike. This isn't why I bought an Audi Cabriolet. But it is a side benefit.

I'll admit I'm not unbiased. I first test drove the Cabriolet soon after they were introduced as 1994 model cars. I was a current Audi owner already impressed with quality and value. When I drove the Cab it certainly helped that it was a clear, warm, Southern California sunny day about 75 degrees or so. But the car spoke volumes for itself. It's classy style and lines show sophistication and a design that will betray it's age far better than a Hollywood actor's facelift. 

Open the door. Slip into the supple, comfortable, yet supportive leather seats. Let your eyes swim across the impeccably detailed interior, including real walnut trim. Close the door and listen to the solid sound of a well-engineered, possibly over-engineered car.

Start the car. Relish it's smooth, quiet engine. Take the top down. Undo the latch and hold the button. Marvel how the top automatically folds neatly away below the rear deck. You won't even see it from inside the trunk. Now drive. Slip into gear and pull away. Slowly, at first, because you won't believe how incredibly smooth it is. It's as though you are gliding on a cushion of air. On a well-paved road you might convince yourself to adjust the side-view mirror so that you can see the wheels just to make sure you <i>are</i> still on the ground. Notice how the transmission glides from gear to gear like a hot knife through butter. Maybe you didn't notice. Maybe you <i>couldn't</i> notice.

The fit and finish are flawless. The engine and transmission are totally smooth. The features and accessories are teutonic in their cleanliness, function and form. I was surprised to find <i>rear</i> fog lights that brighten your red taillights, as well as front driving lights. Also found are an easily controlled climate system, a sport mode for the transmission that holds shifting for more aggressive driving, and, if you have the cold-weather package, individually controlled heated front seats. Even if you live in a rather warm climate, you can use these to extend your topless driving days further into the colder parts of the season, or for warm rides in the evening or night. Have you ever seen the stars at night while peacefully whispering along in a convertible?

One reason some convertible owners don't lower their top more often is because they fear the wind will mess up their hair. Audi solves this problem -fold: First, design the car aerodynamically to minimize excessive wind. Second, add a wind-screen to cover the rear seats when not in use. Third, create a &quot;pocket zone&quot; that virtually eliminates heavy wind entry when all windows are rolled up with the top down. When you drive like this, you'll hardly notice the wind moving your hair at all.

To top it all off, you have more options in this convertible than nearly any other. There are rear seats. And they are usable. You can drive alone. Take your husband/wife/boyfriend/girlfriend. Take along another couple. Take along the kids. Don't leave adults in the back all day, but they'll be fine for a pleasure drive, or a trip to a nearby resort or venue.

If you aren't totally convinced you love this car, stop the car at once and let someone else drive you back. This car isn't for you. In fact, no convertible is or perhaps ever will be. The Audi Cabriolet is as close to perfection in a convertible priced under $60,000. The good news is that it's priced far less.

The only thing that could have made this car perfect was an additional 40 horsepower or so. Don't get me wrong, this car has good power. In fact, it has enough for it's role. But we always want more. If I could have all this <i>and</i> beat nearly every other car off the line...If I could have my cake and eat it, too...<br><br>
