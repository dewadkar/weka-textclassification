            Now driving my third Honda Accord, I can say unequivocally, that this is the finest, most reliable automobile around.  Comfort wise, small to medium size people will find it outstanding.  The reliability is unequalled -- all you do is change the oil for the first 35,000 miles and it performs solidly.

It handles like a sports car, turns on a dime and costs little to maintain.  Gas mileage is average and storage capacity is spacious.  I'm off to look at the new models :)<br><br>
