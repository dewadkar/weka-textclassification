            Leaving my Honda Civic behind at the dealership was saddening to me.  I had invested thousands in aftermarket parts to improve suspension, intake, exhaust, wheels & tires, etc.  The sales woman thought I was out of my mind!

The minute I left the dealership in my brand new 2K2 SE-R Spec V, I forgot about endless amounts of money trying to squeak 5 horsepower out of the already taxed D16 motor in my Civic.  I also erased from my memory the long periods of time I waited for the needle on the tachometer to read 7K where the only resemblance of power was to be found (Honda owners, I'm not bashing, just being honest.  I still like Hondas).  

The Spec V introduces "fun" back into sport compacts that was only thought to be available in packages like the Acura Integra Type R (ITR) or the exclusive J-spec Civic Type R (CTR).  The Spec V raised my eyebrows and those Mustangs who caught up next to me at the following light to ask, "Nitrous?"  And to their disbelief (as well as mine!) I said "Stock."  The Spec V holds up to Nissan's slogan "everything you need, nothing you don't" with this edition.  Power locks, windows and optional moonroof fill out the red-illuminated guages, titanium shift knob, and leather wrapped steering wheel.  The optional 450-watt Rockford Fosgate Audio Package is worthy to most audiophiles who have been back and forth to the high-end stereo shop always wanting more (I know, I used to work in one).  The Skyline inspired seats (Yes, that's a Nissan too for those of you who don't follow Nissan in Japan) fit well around the shoulders and lower back to keep the driver in place while carving corners with a helical limited slip differential that functions well.  

The front tires will light up frantically with a quick side-step of the clutch as the tach reaches 6200 RPM redline faster than you can say "Whoa!"  Grabbing second induces a toungue-swallowing head jerk into the headrest as well as third if you're on it.  This car has torque.  Don't look at the HP number because the torque is much more impressive and if you think it doesn't go drive the new Civic Si.  Sure it has ten less HP than the Spec V, but 50 lb-ft less torque.  Hmmm, it was no contest for me.

Handling the Spec V to the road are 17" x 7" factory five-spoke alloys with 215/45 R17 Continental Contact Sport tires.  Good grip for stockers and nice riding to boot.  The suspension holds it's own with more "aggressive tuning" than the non-Spec V SE-R by Nissan.  

Nissan's new QR25 engine is designed to breath well down low and this undoubtedly is due to the smaller bore and larger stroke they have brought in with this new 2.5L four cylinder.  Street driving has brought me to find shifting at redline isn't as impressive as shifting about 1K less at 5K RPM.  Simply put, in gear's 1 - 5 there is instant response engaged by Nissan's throttle by wire system.  Sixth gear fills out as overdrive.  Once again, I mention torque.

Overall the car is a much more refined version of what I had handling wise, and a generation beyond in power.  The styling is great, four-doors means cheaper insurance (if you have as many points as I do), and like the Lava Cloth interior that Nissan gave no option to avoid.  I am curious about 1/4 mile times and visiting my old Honda friends and showing them my SE-R Spec V badge on the back of the car.
