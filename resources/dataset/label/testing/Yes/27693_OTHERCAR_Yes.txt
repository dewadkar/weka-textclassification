            I just bought a 1996 Eclipse RS.  I love this car.  The previous owner took pretty good care of this car.  He lowered it and added a few stickers that I am in the process of removing, but overall the car is mostly stock. Which I like.

The body style of the Eclipse is incredible.  The way the car seems to be speeding even standing still.  The aggressive front end.  The short spoiler on the deck.  (This RS was purchased with the options package which included the alloy rims and a GS wing among other things.  

I drive the car to work every day and find zipping through traffic to be very enjoyable, although a bit more bouncy than usual.  Either due to the lowering and/or the wonderfully smoooooooth California Highways!!

Knock on wood, the only thing I've had a problem with is that the Check Engine Light has been coming on.  I took it to the dealer who said it was some kind of vacum leak, but driving it both cooled down and warmed up, they couldn't locate the leak reported by the ECU/CPU.  However, it does drive fine.

I say, if you want a sporty car, but are limited in funds, go buy the '95 - '99 Eclipse.

The only drawback I find on this car really doesn't affect me.  I am 5'6, but sometimes I do find it tough, especially in tight parking spaces (Don't you love San Francisco Parking!!), to get in and out of the car.  This only really effects me when I can't open the door wide.  Taller drivers may find it a lot more difficult.<br><br>
