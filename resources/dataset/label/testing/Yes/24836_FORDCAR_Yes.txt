            The Mustang has always been one of my favorite cars to drive.  That is why I had to check this one out.  I love the Mustang's new look since it came out in 99'.  The 2000 3.9L drives great.  I am a young person so belive me i know how to test cars out to their limits.  The first thing I noticed is how comfortable the seats are.  They conform to my back, keeping me in good posture, but not to the point where i am uncomfortable.  Everything on the dash is well placed and easy to get to, like the radio and climate controls.  The engine almost sounds like a V-8, it has a nice little roar behind it.  I love this sound.  Checking my mirrors i noticed improved range of vision that took away almost all of the blind spots.  The ride was excellent, with good suspension that is not to tight for a rough ride. It is set in a place where the corners can be handled extremely well.  The engine has good response time with the automatic transmission, and has excellent power.  I can really feel 190 horses under the hood.  The car is an excellent car for a person who likes speed and power, but likes to have money in his wallet unlike the V-8's. I don't really have any dislikes of the car.  The stereo sounded awesome, the AC froze me out, and the heated warmed me right back up.  I'm really enjoying this car.<br><br>
