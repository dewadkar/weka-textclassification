            The 1999 Honda Accord has been a great purchase since I bought it last December, 1998.  Honda's have always been reliable cars, but with the new body styling that was introduced in 1998 and refined in 1999, it has evolved to become something smooth and sleek.  Interior spacing is great, especially for those who are over 6 feet tall like I am. In addition, the trunk storage space in this model is huge which lends itself to road trips as it can accommodate several larger pieces of luggage. The handling has been great and it is a very smooth ride.  
Overall, this has been a great car and one I can see myself owning for a long time. 
 
As far as any drawbacks, there are only a couple minor disappointments.  First off is the gas mileage,  Overall, it is a fuel efficient car, getting about 25-27 mpg, but with my old accord (1994) I would easily pass 30mpg so the change was a bit of a surprise.  I'm sure the loss in fuel efficiency can be attributed to some of the computerized advances in the car and the roomier styling, but nevertheless, I was slightly disappointed.  In addition, buyers in large metropolitan areas with tollways beware.  The coin holders and not easy to get to and are somewhat awkward.  I know this is a relatively minor point, but believe me if you travel toll roads like I do in Chicago, having easy access to change holders are very important.  Presently, the coin holders are in the arm rest storage compartment, which is very inconvenient to open &amp; grab change if you're traveling at 55-60 mph.<br><br>
