            I bought mine as a college student looking for reliable transportation! Never owed a car before and had a Dad that is anal about his cars. We researched for two and a half months, comparing what to buy and this car has given me the best time of my life! If you need a big car look else where but comfort and reliability are a number one. I also found the dealer to really keep on top of letting you know the car maintenance schedule and replacing parts if needed by recall! I would recommend this for someone starting out as the payments are reasonable and the car runs great! <br><br>
