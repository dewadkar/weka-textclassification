            I purchased a toyota pick up truck as my first new car back in 1994.  This truck has taken me farther than any other car I have ever owned.  It is now 6 years old, has close to 130K miles, and still is in excellent condition.  Yes, it has its dings in the doors, etc, but that engine just keeps going and going.  We take it in for routine maintenance, but otherwise don't see our mechanic very often.  

To drive this vehicle, is to drive something with zip.  Of all standard transmissions, I think Toyota's is the easiest to maneuver and shift.  But, by far the reason I am sold on Toyota is I was in a car accident with my truck.  We skidded on black ice on an overpass.  Every side of my truck was hit.  The damage was just short of being totalled.  I walked away without a scratch.  I have no doubt that the construction of the truck with dually reinforced sidebars made a difference.  Thank you Toyota!

This is the perfect student vehicle or two car household.  It is great on mileage, so anyone commuting could use the truck and save money on gas mileage.  I would also recommend if someone thinks of buying a new toyota but the price puts them off to consider buying used toyotas.  Have a mechanic check it out thoroughly and then see if that car doesn't fit into your budget and your driveway!<br><br>
