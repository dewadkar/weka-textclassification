               When I went to rent a car for my 5 hour road trip I was looking forward to a Grand Am Gt, since that is the car I had prior road experience in. They didn't have one. All they had in mid-size was the Malibu. Frustrated but in a hurry, I took it. Let me tell you, I wasn't too disappointed after I gave it a try. The Malibu is a nice car, especially from what i see the price range is. If you don't mind spending more, go for the Grand Am Gt..if you are under a budget, Malibu is the way to go. It has a nice ride and I was comfortable during the entire trip, including 2 traffic jams. Exceleration was decent, not spectacular, but i often found myself going faster than i thought and had to slow myself down. What impressed me most was the ac and heat. I have never been in a car that heated up or cooled down so quickly. No waiting forever for that car to warm up. Which is great, especially if you are anemic such as myself. Im also a sucker for stereo knick knacks. 
     The Malibu includes a radio that will tell you the station call letters you are listening to. It also will tell you the artist currently playing and the title of the song on some stations. No more humming that tune to a million people trying to figure out what it was. 
     As far as seating,i have no major complaints. Some friends and I went to a club 45 minutes away and one had to sit in the backseat. My backseat buddy is no small girl and she kept telling me how much room she had! She even fell asleep,looking rather peaceful I must say. If you are looking for a nice car, with some size to it,but don't want to break your bank, Malibu is the way to go. <br><br>
