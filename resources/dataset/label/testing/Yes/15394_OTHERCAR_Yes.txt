            <b>Greetings,</b>
   We won this camera in a contest for just signing up on a mailing list.  What a great Christmas gift from God!  Good timing too, showed up in early December.
   If you have kids, you will get lots of use out of this camera.  Put the film-based camera aside.  This one takes great pictures and stores them on floppy disks for quick upload to your web or one of the free picture sites.  You can adjust the picture size and fit about 30 of the 320 pixel size on one floppy.
   What about the camcorder?  Well, you can get a 60 second MPEG from the Mavica (Be sure to have an empty floppy)!  Not bad.  True, you can get more content from your camcorder ... but you have to move it next to the computer, get your video capture device working, capture, and then save it out to an .avi or .mpg.  Why?  Just get the most important 60 seconds on the Mavica and copy the full-length camcorder tape for the grandfolks!
   We really enjoying hitting the delete button on any shots that came out blurry or out of focus.  Much less painless than waiting the week for regular film-based prints to return and then throwing them away.

<b>There are some negatives with the camera such as:</b>

It takes a few seconds to store the picture AFTER EVERY snapshot.  So, if you dream of being able to hold down the button and get shot after shot, look for a different camera (or put the FD83 into Movie mode).

The battery life is SHORT if you use the backlight for the LCD panel (and the flash).  I've found the backlight for the panel is a must so far, so we may be in the market for the higher capacity battery available from Sony ($60 list).  We obtained the high capacity battery and it is much better!  This is a definite must for anyone that uses the camera a lot.  Before buying, look into the price of their &quot;starter kits&quot; as you will get the higher capacity battery, a lens cloth, a carrying case and three floppies.  It may be cheaper than just the battery by itself (watch out on ebay, the auction prices have been going higher than what you would pay for a new starter kit from a store).

<b>BottomLine:</b>
     Looking for a digital camera?  Consider this one or one of its derivatives.  You will find the features are nice and useful.  To add more features it would have added more weight or made it bulkier, so this is a great trade-off.<br><br>
