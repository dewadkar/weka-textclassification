            We bought a 1997 Oldsmobile Bravada after looking at the Explorers and Blazers after doing a comparison of features at Edmunds.com.   What sold us was the interior, specifically the seats and their comfort.   It's been a great, reliable vehicle and kept us all safe when we were hit from the rear by a car traveling in excess of 45 mph (they didn't notice we were stopped at a red light in the dense fog.)
My only major complaint(after 3 years of ownership) concerns the air conditioner in that model year.  It just couldn't compete with the color scheme we chose of black on black.  Pretty, yes, but STIFLING in heat in excess of 90 degrees.
If Bravada offered a 8 cylinder engine this year, we'd probably buy another one (still might).  All we know for certain is that we aren't going to suffer through another summer with an air conditioner that can't keep up.
We are looking into Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited as a replacement as they offer a V-8 engine and off road capabilities.<br><br>
