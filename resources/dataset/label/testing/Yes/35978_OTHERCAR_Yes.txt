            Very satisfied with this automobile. The car currently has 78k miles on it and is still running like new. After enduring an accident that nearly destroyed the car, it was rebuilt and is still running as if nothing had happend. Very reliable and very economical if you drive normally and appropriatley. Granted the car zips in and out of traffic nicely, this car should not be mistaken for a race car. If you are concerned with other reviews claiming terrible gas mileage, the gas gage can be a bit decieving. A good method of calculating gas mileage is to zero the trip meter when you fill up, drive until your next refueling, then divide the total milage that you drove (from the trip meter) and divide that by the total gallons that your car needed to refill to full. On average with highway driving and some city, I will average a respectable 34 miles per gallon. However if i drive a bit aggresively the car still turns in a decent 30 mpg..... not too shabby.

The car overall is comfortable for two people. Three people can get by, and four people for no more than two hours or so... good luck squeezing five in there for more than 25 minutes. There is a significant amount of road noise filtering into the car, but with a decent stock stereo road noise isn't so much of an issue. 

The only negative things I'd have to say about this car are the brakes (they wear out rather quickly) and an engine who might be very well adequate with power, but as mentioned before won't leave any other cars in the dust.
