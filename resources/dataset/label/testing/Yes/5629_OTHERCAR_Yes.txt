            I've had my vibe for now 3 months.  So far I still love this car.  I bought it for 18,500 with everything including an extended warranty.  I didn't get the navigation system or any spoilers or colored trim. But I got every other accessory that could be had.   First, realize that this is really a Toyota Corolla mechanically.  It actually probably handles a little better than a Toyota Corolla, because Pontiac gave it a little stiffer suspension, so the ride is a little busier on little bumps, but for potholes this car takes them very nicely, no bottoming out.  Sharp turns are fun with very little lean, and this car is very unlikely to roll over even though it has more ground clearance than a Toyota. Now people complain about the acceleration of this car, I find it now to be much of problem, It easily gets me to speed on on ramps right up to about 65-75 mph even going uphill.  It's just that this car really revs up to do it, so it gives a loud, throaty acceleration like a sports car.  I actually don't mind it at all. At highway speeds, it is reasonably quiet.  The controls are reasonably placed, and logical. The dash lights are difficult to read with polarized sunglasses, and the radio was impossible to read.  I replaced the radio anyway with a mp3 player and that took care of that problem.  Also the FM reception was mediocre on the factory unit anyway. The seats are reasonably comfortable, but there is no place to rest you elbows while driving.  They could do better here.  The back seat is also very comfortable and roomy. The car has lots of neat features which add to the enjoyability.  It has lots of compartments many of which are hidden, all over the vehicle.  It has an outside thermometer and an 110 outlet built in. In my view their is plenty of space behind the rear seat to stow stuff also.   In the 3 months I've owned the vehicle, no problems so far other than a rubbing squeak, but I not yet sure it is not something I'm carrying. One thing a found out is that anything in the door pockets will be rattled by the door speakers.  I have the moon and tunes package, so the speakers push out lots of bass. I think I took care of this problem by putting sticky felt in the door pockets for cushioning. This of course is one of the main problems of the car and that is is trimmed mostly in hard noisy plastic, so a bit of sticky felt in the right places can be very helpful here.  Otherwise objects stored around the car can create the idea you have rattles in the car, when they are things stored in the nooks and crannies of this vehicle. 
The outside styling of the car is unusual and I get lots of complements about that.
