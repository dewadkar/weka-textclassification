            A year ago I was looking for a car trying to escape the continual borrowing of my parents. I scanned the local classifieds for a while. I was looking for a good car, with a good ride at a fairly good deal. After a few days of looking I lucked out. Found an ad for a 1990 Acura Legend LS. Nice dark green color with a leather interior.

I met the seller a few days later, and of course took the car for a test drive. I instantly fell in love. The car handled beautifully. Acceleration was great, and very roomy. I had the car checked out and aside from a few minor cosmetic defects the car was in great condition.

The car has been fantastic. It's fully loaded. Has power everything. V6 engine. Eight speaker stereo. The works. It's a nice comfortable ride for a 6'1&quot; 200+ pound guy like myself. It's also quite comfortable for my equally large friends. The particular model I have is a four door sedan. I'm not sure how that compares to the coupe model, but I suspect the backseat of the sedan model would be larger than the coupe model.

One of my favorite features is the small on-board computer. It has this small digital readout that tells you the miles on a trip, how many miles are left in the gas tank, how many miles till your next oil change or servicing.

The thing that impressed me the most through was not the car itself really but the service from an Acura dealer. One night while driving back from work the car lost power and the engine stalled. I had it towed to my local Acura dealer, and explained the problem of course. Next day I call up to check on my car. Turns out one of the engine parts had died, and the good news was that it had been on recall for a few years. They replaced the part with a new one and the whole thing cost me nothing! Zero! I was impressed. They provided excellent service to someone who had never even visited an Acura dealer ever before.

Between the car and the service I got, I am throughly satisfied with Acura. They already sold me on a new Acura. Just as soon as I get the cash to buy a new one.<br><br>
