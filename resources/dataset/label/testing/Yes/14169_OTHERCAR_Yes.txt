            In both size and sales, the AM General Hummer is absolutely HUGE!  While certainly not the most attractive vehicle appearing in model year 2000 showrooms, its beauty is more or less hidden in the status associated with driving one.  With an average price tag of over 40K, its price far surpasses its closest competitors (those offered by BMW, Mercedes, Range Rover, etc.). However, many folks have decided to make the large investment otherwise called &quot;purchasing an AM General Hummer.&quot;  One would have to be at least 8 feet tall in order to reasonably find Hummer's interior to be miniscule.  IT'S HUGE!  However, for some drivers, Hummer may offer a little bit too much room, causing difficulty in managing the vehicle.  The power deliver by its engines is not even in the same class as some of the vehicle's competitors- it's enormous.  All in all, if you're in the price range, and like the idea of driving an incredibly enormous vehicle, give Hummer a chance <br><br>
