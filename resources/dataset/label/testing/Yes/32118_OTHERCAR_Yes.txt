            I needed a vehicle to get to and from work.  I originally owned a 97 Dodge Dakota Sport regular cab.  The truck was plagued with problems and I had to start transporting my kids from daycare (one in a child-seat).  The Dakota just wasn't cutting it anymore, so I went shopping.

I drove the Tundra and I was blown away, I had to have it.  The power and comfort was impressive.  I put my foot in the gas and the truck responded with a sweet throaty exhaust note and instant acceleration.  Some people may go for the captain chairs but I found the standard 60/40 bench seat was quite comfortable and supportive plus you can transport 1 extra passenger with the bench seat compared to captain seats.  I did notice The controls for the CD player/radio are somewhat difficult to reach and sometimes require looking from the road to find which button to push. All of the other controls are well laid out and easy to operate.  One big knock on the Access Cab is it's smaller rear cab.  I, however, don't find this as a problem.  I primarily transport my 4 and 8 year old kids and its usually for short distances.  They find the cab very comfortable (especially compared to that death-trap of a Dakota we were stuck in before).  Actually we do more family traveling in the Tundra, than our family car.  I prefer the size of this truck compared to some of the other trucks with bigger cabs.  Toyota will be releasing a crew-cab Tundra,  but I don't particularly enjoy driving vehicles that are that large.  Another factor to consider is vehicle safety.  The Tundra comes with ABS standard and came out on top in government crash tests (big factor when hauling kids or considering insurance rates).  I don't just use my truck for transportation, it has seen its share of work.  I've had it loaded down with about 1600 lbs of brick and it handles fine and had no problem getting up to highway speeds.  If you dish it out, this truck can take it.  I found that Toyota's option packages can be confusing (and expensive) if you decide to order a custom rig.  I bought one right off the lot and ended up getting $3000 in rebates, which put the price even with/or lower than comparable trucks.  

I love this truck.  It is great when you have a vehicle that can work as hard as the Tundra does but is refined enough to drive everyday and function as a family vehicle.  Good job Toyota, I expect the Tundra Crew-Cab will be a success.
