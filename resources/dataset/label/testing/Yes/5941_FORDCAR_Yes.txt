            With home ownership comes a whole new set of necessary items to buy and errands to run, but until late October we'd been able to use one or the other of our sedans for everything we needed. (you <i>can</i> fit a 12' roll of carpet into a Volvo sedan, by the way.)

Then in late October, three things happened:  We bought a D-I-Y shed-in-a-box, we had a windstorm, and our half-finished shed was turned into scrap steel.  We needed to take it back to Home Depot, but there was no way the remains were going to fit in our car.  We needed to rent a truck.

We considered renting a U-Haul, but after figuring mileage charges decided to rent a pickup truck from a "normal" car-rental place.  When we arrived at Budget rent-a-car, the F150 we wanted was still out, so they rented us a dark blue <b>2001 Expedition XLT.</b>

The SUV was moderately loaded with a package that included a 6-way power driver's seat, auto-dimming mirror, power-<b>adjustable pedals,</b> power windows, mirrors and locks, lighted running boards and a 3rd-row seat.  It also had aluminum wheels and meaty tires, and the upgraded 5.4-liter "Triton" V8 engine.

First <b>driving impression </b>was that it drove "smaller" than it actually was.  I found it <b>quite easy </b>to crank it out of the tight rental parking lot at the airport.  Second impression was that the thing was <i>powerful.</i>  The first three takeoffs I made snapped my head back until I learned the right amount of throttle to give it.

Overall, the Expedition was easy to pilot on the open road.  The truck platform it's based on was <b>sprung a bit softer </b>and wasn't as "boingy" as a pickup.  This SUV is fairly heavy, and wasn't affected much by crosswinds, either.  The steering was good for a vehicle its size, and I found it exceedingly easy to keep it in my lane. (actually, now I wonder why so many of these things seem to be wandering over centerlines...)

I don't know what the base 4.6-liter motor is like in an Expedition, but if you can stomach getting <b>14 miles per gallon,</b> I'd recommend upgrading to the <b>5.4-liter Triton</b> engine.  The thing has <i>guts!</i>  In some cars you have to "give it some gas," or "depress the accelerator."  With other cars you can "punch it" or "drop the hammer."

I "dropped the hammer" a couple of times, and found that <b>roll-on acceleration </b>from 50 mph to 75 mph or so was <b>really rapid.</b>  The automatic transmission was exceptionally smooth while doing it, as well.

Once I got home, I opened the liftgate and removed the <b>3rd seat.</b>  The removal process was easy, but the seat itself is bulky and <b>heavy </b>-- carrying it is a job for two people or one person with a strong back.  The 2nd-seat folded down and almost flat with virtually no effort, leaving an <b>8-foot deep cargo area </b>to the back of the front seats.  I was able to toss the mostly-disassembled dead shed into the back of the Expedition with plenty of room left over -- in fact, I only needed to fold down the "60" part of the 60/40 fold-down second-row seat.

After returning from Home Depot, my 5'0" wife climbed in, and declared it easy due to the running-board and multitude of grab-handles.  We then went up our road, which is dirt, and had been soup-ified by a solid week of rain.  The Expedition <b>forged through foot-deep ruts</b> in the mud with only a touch of squirrelyness with the electric 4x4 selector in the "AWD" setting.  Turning it to "4Hi" removed any trace of instability, and my wife had fun sending muddy water flying up onto the windshield.

We traded places and I pointed the SUV down a familiar two-track.  Again, the Expedition drove "smaller" than it actually is.  <b>Visibility is excellent,</b> and I was able to place the wheels where I needed them on the trail.  The Triton motor pulled the heavy SUV through an unexpectedly deep (but probably not over the hubs) waterhole without hesitation.  The gutsier I got, the more fun I had.  Let's just sum it up by saying that I achieved my goal of getting <b>mud on the roof.</b>

The next morning we picked up two friends of ours and went out to breakfast in our dirty rental Expedition. (you so rarely see them dirty, you know?) The SUV held myself, my wife, my 18-month-old son in his carseat, my 6'4" friend and his SO, with plenty of shoulder and leg room for all, and we didn't even use the 3rd seat.

Summing up, the Expedition was easy to steer in a parking lot, easy to drive on the open road, easy to drive on a two-track, grin-inspiringly powerful, cavernous inside, and got abysmally bad gas mileage.
