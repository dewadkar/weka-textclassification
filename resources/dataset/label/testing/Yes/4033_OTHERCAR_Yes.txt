            After having a 1997 Suburban for three years, we decided it was time to go smaller. We were really impressed with the looks of the new Tahoe and Suruban, so we took each one for a test drive.

The first thing we noticed was the improved ride. In the front bucket seats, the ride felt like we were on air. I was really suprised. In the back seats, it felt great too. The front seat warmers are really a nice treat.

The controls are faced closer to the driver, allowing him/her to concentrate more on the road. This does make it harder for the passanger, however, to reach them.

We decided on getting the tricked out Sunset Gold Metallic Tahoe, it has the Sunroof, heated leather seats, and the third seat. The Third seat is tricky at first to remove/replace but we figured it out eventually. After having this car for 8 months, the only problem we have had was when the motors on the back windows went out. They were replaced by the dealer for free. 

If you are looking for the agility of a sports car in an SUV, you might want to look elsewhere. Even though this SUV is smaller then some other competitors, you can still tell its size when you are driving it.
