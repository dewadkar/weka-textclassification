            I have owned several vehicles including a BMW, Toyota Celica, Chevy Blazer truck, Iszuzu Impulse, and several others.  But for me, this little firecracker is by far the most fun car I have ever owned.  It is quick enough for me to zip in, out and about and I'm not a race car driver.

It doesn't have a latch for the trunk which in a way is good since many times I park with the top left off and it would be quite easy for someone to reach in and pop the trunk and take what they wanted if their was an inside the car trunk latch.  The trunk surprisingly is HUGE for a car this size even when storing the top.

I am 6'1" and weigh about 197lbs and I fit perfectly in the car without effort.  There's only room for me and my lady and that's the way I like it. 

If I were a critic I would give this a five out of five stars.
