            I have owned my Jetta GLS 1.8T wagon since 12/26/03. When I first started looking for a new car I wanted a car that was fun to drive yet provided functionality. The perfect blend was found in the Jetta wagon. 

The Jetta doesn't "feel" like a wagon as you drive it. The 1.8T engine has plenty of power for effortless acceleration and highway merging. Amazing what a turbo can do for a small engine. Doing most of my driving "around town" I went with the 5 speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. If you expect the tiptronic to be like a standard transmission without a clutch, you'll be disappointed. Take it for what it is though, an automatic that you can "shift", and you should be very happy with it. 

The rear hatch is very roomy and I've gotten some pretty big loads into it. With the rear seats folded down the little wagon can haul some pretty big items. The rear seats fold completely flat, but the front seats must be moved almost all the way forward to do so. The interior of the car is the best of all the small wagons I looked at. The quality of the materials is far above what other cars in it's class have. It also comes standard with ABS and traction control, two must haves in New England winters. The storage area under the floor in the rear hatch is an efficient use of small space. Under the rear floor are small storage areas that surround the FULL SIZE spare tire! No little "donut" on this car.

The only problem I have had with the car is not a problem on newer models. In the earlier 1.8T engines the ignition coils had a manufacturer defect and would fail (the car uses these coils in place of traditional spark plugs, one coil for each cylinder). At 3,500 miles I found my car acting very strangely while running errands. Pulled over to the side of the road, got out the owners manual to find what the lights on the dash meant. Manual said it was a failure in the engine but I could drive the car if I was only going a short distance. Since I was only a mile and a half from the nearest VW dealer I decided to drive there under reduced power. I had two of the four ignition coils fail at the same time! My car got me 1.5 miles on only two cylinders, I was impressed! That said to me that the engine was well made if it was still drivable on only two cylinders.

My car now has just a hair over 9,000 miles on it. I still look forward to driving it everyday. It's a fun to drive car that feels more expensive and luxurious than any car in it's price range.
