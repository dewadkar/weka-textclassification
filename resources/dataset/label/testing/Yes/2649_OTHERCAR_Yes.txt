            We traded in a 2 year old accord coupe to get this because we had a baby and needed something that would accommodate our growing family. The car seat just didn't fit into the accord very well at all and the stroller required 2 people to get it into the trunk. Since I got my CR-V I go more places because it is so much easier to get my baby into and out of the back. Also the stroller fits perfectly in the back with room to spare! 

Why I like the CR-V: 
It is a great car for families. We took a trip this weekend and we were able to fit 2 adults, 1 baby, and 2 large dogs in a cage. Not to mention all of the luggage. The CR-V comes with many cool features. For example if you are on a family trip and you get hungry and want to pull over to eat there is a picnic table built into the back!!! Also, if you are traveling and want to take a nap the back seats recline. There is a trey under the passenger seat so you can store things as well as many other places to put things. The front seat has 3 cup holders and there are 2 in the back. I live in Texas and air conditioners are important here. This one works great! Another plus to this vehicle is oil changes are no longer every 3000 miles, they are every 7500 miles which as you can see cuts maintenance costs in half! 

Why I got the EX: 
We wanted the EX because it comes in the 4x4 that engages itself when it feels the ground is slick. Other things that this model comes with standard are the sun roof, 6 cd in dash cd player, door clickers, and rear tinted windows. 

What I would like to see different on the CR-V: 
Maybe it&#146s because I went form a V-6 accord to a 4 cylinder CR-V but I would like to see the CR-V offered with a V-6. As is it does have nice pickup but the engine lets you know it is working for it. Also I would like to see this vehicle offered with leather interior. Makes it easier to wipe down when you have little ones. I would also like to have this vehicle come equipped with the automatic seat adjustment controls. These are for the most part little details. 

We already had an incident of someone pulling out in front of us and having to slam on the brakes. The CR-V stopped quickly and with no trouble. As far as safety goes we researched many vehicles and this was the most highly rated in its class.
