            I have three children, one in a car seat, so a big back seat was very important to me when I was shopping for a new car. I am NOT ready to head into the mini-van scene!  Maybe it's immature, but I want something that looks cool, even though I am 34 and have three kids, I do get out on my own sometimes. The Dodge Stratus has the biggest backseat of any car in its class. We looked at all of them, and you just can't compare the size of this back seat and the ample leg room it affords.  We were recently squashed into the back seat of a Ford Taurus, it was not pleasant. The Dodge has enough room for adults to sit comfortably.

I bought the SE Plus model with 4cyl. engine. The 4 cyl. moves just fine up hills and it picks up speed fairly quickly. The dash has faux wood and a simple control design, for those of you who don't like to crash your car while looking for the heat controls. Some of these new cars have so many buttons, you have to pull over just to change the radio station.  There are two cup holders in front and two in back, very convenient for the kids.  The back seat folds down, either one side or both (60/40), for those trips to the Home Depot.  Remote trunk release, locks and panic button are included as standard.  There are many extra features, too numerous to list.

The look of this car is just fabulous. The Stratus didn't used to look that special, just an ordinary sedan, but they've really sported up the front and back of this car, it looks sharp from every angle and I actually prefer it to the Intrepid, which is supposed to be a sportier car. 

The gas mileage is pretty good so far, we are averaging about 27 miles to the gallon on rural travel with our 4 cylinder, it averages 21 city, 30 hwy.

I highly recommend a test drive in one of these cars, you won't be disappointed. The kids love it!
