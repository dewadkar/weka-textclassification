            First off, let me say this: I have read the other opinions about the weak engine in the SE.  This is not a performance sedan, sports car, or even a sporty car.

This car is what it is - a nice car with tons of interior room, a huge trunk and nice features.  If you want gobs of power, check out the intrepid R/T.

I have the SE with the 24B package - the one that was greatly discounted by Dodge once the 2001 models were on the floor.  I have the Front Taupe color (the best as far as I'm concerned).  

As I said before, this car comes nicely equipped with the things that I needed.  Power windows, locks and drivers seat. Cruise control, tilt wheel and air conditioning.  AM/FM cassette radio. I really liked the gauge cluster with the white gauge backings. Nice touch.

I do wish this car had the standard transmission, but what can you do - that is just a personal preference.

Lots of interior and trunk room sold this car for me.  I have fit 5 adults and luggage in this car with no problems.  The front seats are comfortable on all but the longer trips (6+ hours).  The back seats are less comfortable but are much better than the other cars in this class.  

The engine moves the car along just fine.  No 0-60 in under 8, but that's OK.  The only issue I have with the engine is the gas mileage.  I figure I get around 18 or 19 average.  That's a little low for a car such as this.

All-in all a great car for the money.
