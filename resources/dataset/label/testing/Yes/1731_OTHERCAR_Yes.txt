            I purchased this vehicle a month ago for about 20K with 33K miles, mainly because I had almost bought this car in 95 when I was car shopping and it made sense to revisit it now.  My primary car is a 92 Maxima SE, which I love, so that is my primary basis of comparison.

The car is exactly what I expected.  It has a full assortment of safety features, including air bags on the front and side, as well as ABS brakes.  I drive pretty aggressively, and I was very pleased with the handling.  Nimble comes to mind.  The brakes were great too.  I kinda wish it had a stiffer suspension because of my driving style, but I'm not the primary driver I didn't make a big deal out of that.

My base model included leather seats, which definitely gave it some more comfort points in my mind.  Seat adjustments are manual, and do not offer several degrees of freedom as I would have expected in a Volvo.  The levers do not have the most intuitive operation either.  The stereo is on par with other factory stereos, so no plus or minus there.  Dual climate control is definitely a nice feature.

The engine is very boring, but that is because this is the base model.  I test drove the turbo and it was great!  The base model only has around 175 horses but this boring engine does provide great gas mileage (22/28).  On a recent road trip, it climbed easily to 95 but didn't want to go much higher as easily.  The ride was always smooth.  I've only owned this car a short time so the word is still out on reliability (but the records seem to indicate an excellent history)

Probably the worst thing about this car is the visibility.  The hood is difficult to see from the driver seat, which can make parking difficult.  It's probably due to a combination of the forward slant on the car and the inability to raise the height of the seat without adjusting the tilt.  Also, the rear seats have headrests so that hurts when doing quick lane changes and just trying to be aware of the cars around you.

In general, I would say this car is perfect for a mom with kids.  Maybe the turbo would be better for my driving style...<br><br>
