            It was a big step to go to four doors after having only driven sportier coupes and roadsters.  Don't let me give you the wrong impression, my previous two cars were a '95 Ford Probe SE, which I totalled before it could give me any typical Ford trouble, and most recently a '95 del Sol SI, which was uncomfortable and too small for the SUV burdened traffic of today.  So don't think I stepped down from Ferrari or even a Corvette for that matter.

Having made the change in September of 2001, I can say that I have only a few negative comments about the Civic EX Sedan of 2001.  The car serves up a ton of wind noise at higher speeds, particularly the whistling coming from the back edge of the front doors, an issue I understand was corrected in the 2002 model (I would love for Honda to offer me replacement 2002 door seals as a warranted repair).  Secondly, there seems to be more and more squeaks and rattles coming from the interior parts, mainly in the doors.  I thought it lame that I was able to blow two of the speakers, immediately fixed under warranty, even though I made no changes to the sound system -- the stock speakers should handle the stock stereo's power.  Finally, and most bothersome, all the literature and the dealer referred to the 13+ gallon gas tank.  My car's low fuel light has come on at least 3 times since I've had the car, and I've never been able to get more than 10.5 gallons in this car.  I drive about 35 miles each way to work and back, and I had hoped to get the alleged high mileage combined with the 13 gallon gas tank so I could commute the week away without a midweek fill-up.  

Now, on to the good things.  This is a cute and sporty sedan.  I enjoy the peppy performance I get with the VTEC on the EX model.  Combined with the larger wheels and the 5 speed, I have about as much fun as I did with my del Sol.  Just don't tell my inner-child that I'm driving a family car, as if the screamingly mundane beige interior doesn't already let me know.  I love all the standard features that come with the EX.  Might I suggest a few options that surely will help escape the "car-of-the-masses" syndrome.  Add the spoiler, add the alloy rims, get a 5-speed, don't get silver!
