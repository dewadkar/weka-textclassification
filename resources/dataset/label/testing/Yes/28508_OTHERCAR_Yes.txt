            Okay, I just stepped out of a '97 Toyota 4Runner, and let me tell you that the Saab is a welcome change. I have a 2000 Green Manual Saab 93 Turbo. This car is an excellent ride, when you throw it into 2nd gear and feel the turbo thrusting you beyond 4k Rpms it is a thrill. The car's interior is quiet, comfortable, and extremly ergonomic. The intuitive interior design, is amazing, the ignition is a little higher than the handbrake, and almost every feature is accessable from this area. The cars audio is amazing, it has a surround sound with 8 internal speakers, that automaticly changes the volume to compinsate for engine noise. The cars grip is spectacular, and amazingly safe, and extremly comfortable. I would strongly recommend that anybody would purchase this vehicle. I have been satisfied from the first day, and plan on buying it out after the lease is over. <br><br>
