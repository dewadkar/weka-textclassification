            I have to admit, before stepping into the LS 400, my opinion was biased. I was told by nearly all who have acquainted themselves with the auto that there simply &quot;is no better.&quot; Despite my best efforts to remain neutral, the mystique of the vehicle took over...

I admired its smooth contours from a distance taking special note of its generous size and graceful aesthetics. I glanced at the specs: 4.0 Liter 290HP Four Cam 32-Valve V8 Engine with Continuously Variable Valve Timing and a flawless 4-Spd Auto Overdrive transmission. The specs however, mean little as you drive this masterpiece. It's noiseless, fluid handling are dreamlike and its amenities are extraordinary. The car truly is incomparable especially if you look at it from a cost standpoint. At a base price of about $53k, it is tough to beat.
 
If you're looking for uncompromising quality, The Lexus LS 400 is the car for you. I had difficulty-finding fault with it but anyone who knows me knows I can find fault if not with the vehicle itself then some of the points associated with it.
 Here are some points to consider:
1)(Don't Lease it) unless you have money to burn that is...Get a 2 or 3-year-old model just broken in. They're still under warranty and have all the luster of a new one. Used models can be purchased at considerable discounts extending the car's value even further.
2)(it wasn't car and driver's first pick) It wasn't even in the top ten, which I find hard to believe. They liked the GS 400 better and rated it #9 on their top 10 list for 1999. So consider this model as well as the LS 400
3)(Don't bring it to any old repair shop) Remember, even though the LS 400 is an excellent car, it is STILL a car. At some point you will have to do some preventative maintenance and repairs. You can't just bring it down the street to Joe's Garage. You are basically forced to bring it to an authorized repair center at an authorized repair center's price. It is a scam of sorts, but so aren't cars in general.
4) (Others will resent you) donï¿½t expect others to be happy for you. Your friends and neighbors despite their outward vote of confidence will quietly hate you. The hordes of us that are confined to domestic clunkers won't sing the same songs of praise that you do and you will be treated accordingly.
5) (Let the parker beware) Scratches and dents the likes of which occur with any car have a higher incidence with these cars (see #4 as to the reasoning of why). There is also a higher than average propensity towards theft (and their correlated insurance premiums). The combination of these effects may negate any of the soothing effects associated with performance and luxury the car has to offer.

In general, I view cars as a means of transportation (that's what they are aren't they?). As a good value for uncompromising luxury, everything is relative. You could buy 106 of my 1985 Volvo DL wagons for the cost of one brand new LS 400! You may spend the entire GDP of an average Mexican town on this car but you can rest assured that by American standards you got an amazing car at a good price.
