            I bought my Sebring in June of 1998. It was a dealer demo so I got about $5,000 off. I decided to go for the top-of-the-line. I purchased the Limited package. I have had no mechanical problems at all. I put a lot of miles on my cars (about 100 a day). I already have 41,000 on my Sebring. The only problem I've had so far is my back window leaked. My dealer replaced it with no questions asked. I love my car best in summer. I never have my roof up, except when it rains. To put the roof down, is with the touch of a button. Before I bought it people told me they are cold in the winter. No they aren't. They do come with heat you know, and heated mirrors. The back window is real glass so they do have a rear defogger. I have leather seats which warm up nicely. My husband loves to drive my car because you can shift it if you want. I prefer the automatic transmission myself. I just wish I could go through a car wash. The manual says it's OK but they don't recommend it. <br><br>
