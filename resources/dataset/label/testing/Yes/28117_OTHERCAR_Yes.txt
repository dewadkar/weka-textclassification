            I recently purchased a new Polaroid PDC 700 digital camera from my local dealer.  I was looking for an inexpensive camera that would suit my everyday photographic needs.  The PDC 700 has everything you need to get started right away.  I was pleased that the camera came in a package form including everything you need with the exception of batteries and memory card.  The kit did have the Photo Max and Photo Pro Editing software, but in my opinion, additional instructional information should also have been included.  There was help available at Polaroid online and the advice and instruction was very useful. For a beginner in digital photography, this camera should satisfy their needs.  There are a few problems that I did incur with the 700 upon my first day of use. If you use flash and then display each picture on the LED screen while using batteries, the camera will go dead after about 22 pictures in the Fine resolution mode.  Also, the pictures look a little grainy unless you use the 12 exposure{super fine}resolution mode. The LED screen is easy to read and is well defined.  I do like the the way you can alter or use de-fault when adjusting the EV compensation value or shutter speed for certain applications such as indoor portrait. The PDC 700 will suit the non-discriminating photographer well, and for the $223.33 dollar price it is affordable and well worth the investment.<br><br>
