             I have had my grand Vitara sence early 99. I have had no troble at all with this Suv. I drive it in the mountanis and of road a lot and it has no troble unlike my Grand fathers grand cheerekee. It did not have grate acceleration when I first got it but at 15,000 it became a lot faster. It now has 45,ooo miles on it and I love it. I recemned this car way before any Honda Jeep toyota all then cars like that. I have gotton this car to 105 befor and it accually handled really well. I test drove the crv cherreke and those cars and this is sertanly the way to go. before I had this I had a suzuki sumari that had 280,000 miles on it when I sold it and the only things I replaced on that car was a radiator and brakes.<br><br>
