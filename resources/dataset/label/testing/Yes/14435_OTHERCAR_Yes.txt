            I bought my 1996 Camry LE for $13,000 in 1999.  It had 36,000 miles on it the day I purchased this fantastic car.  In a year's time, I've added another 22,000 miles.  The only maintenance I've done on the Camry is regular oil changes.  I'm due soon for the normal upkeep: timing belt and tires.  In other words, this car takes care of itself.

The Camry has the horsepower to rival bigger and more expensive cars.  It adapts well to different altitudes without losing its power.  This car raced past comparable cars like the Honda Accord and even a Mercedes Benz as I drove it up into the Rocky Mountains and Yellowstone National Park last summer.

The Camry fits in perfectly for a family lifestyle or for a single lifestyle.  The Camry looks great, is safe and reliable, and gets decent gas mileage for a mid-sized car (I average about 22 miles/gallon in the city and 28 miles/gallon on the highway).  It has a lot of leg room in the front, but taller passengers will be slightly uncomfortable sitting in the back.

My only complaint (and it's minor) is that I'm almost six feet tall and my head bumps up against the sunroof if I don't slouch slightly in the driver's seat.

You won't regret buying a Camry, whether new or used.<br><br>
