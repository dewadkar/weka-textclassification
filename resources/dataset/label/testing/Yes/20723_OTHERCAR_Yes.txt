            I currently own a 1997 Chevy Blazer LS-fully loaded.  Maybe the mistake I made was to buy it as a Demo.  When I bought the car, it had 6,000 miles on it, and since I brought it home, it has given me nothing but grief!

A short list of the systems that it has had problems with so far:

Electronic Compass - wrong readings
Automatic 4WD switch - didn't switch from 2WD--&gt;4WD
Speakers - Blown twice
Transmission - Rough idling
Electronic Seats - stopped working
Rear Windshield wiper - stopped working

In addition, there is an incredible amount of road noise compared with it's cousin vehicle (the GMC Jimmy).  

Although it hasn't had any MAJOR engine trouble or any costly repairs (all under warranty currently), I would hate to keep this vehicle after the warranty period...

Judging from the experiences of other owners, I think that my experience is unfortunately not a unique one...  Be very careful when thinking about this car...
