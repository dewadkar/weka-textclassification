            I have had my Toyota minivan for almost a year now and would definitely buy another one.  In fact, anyone I know that tells me they are looking at new vehicles, I tell them to check out the Sienna.  The ride you get in the Sienna is great.  Everyone that has ridden in the van is surprised by the smooth ride they get.  I have had comments from teenagers to those in their 60's (my in-laws) about what a great vehicle it is.  Now coming from teenagers, you know it has to be something good.  At work I drive a different make, and let me tell you there is a BIG difference between the two.  The value for the product you get is great.  I only got a Sienna CE, a very basic van, but it has everything me and my family need.  The roominess for hauling things is unbelievable.  At Christmas time this year, I hauled home a treadmill for my sister-in-law.  No problem!!  Is there anything I hate about this vehicle?  Not that I can think of.  Who should buy a Toyota Sienna?  Anyone looking for a great vehicle at a great price that has a smooth ride, lots of space and the power you need under the hood.<br><br>
