            First off, I owned a '85 Vette.  The '87 had a few features mine didn't (aluminum heads, ABS, etc), but overall they are still the same car.  
If you are all about handling, be sure you get a Z51 equipped car.  The owner may not even know he has one, but its on the codes on the rear driver side storage lid.  This was the handling package from the factory, and makes a huge difference.  
These cars for the price (I got mine for $5800) are a steal!  They have tons of power, still look nice, and have very well equipped interiors (full power, etc).  They also handle nicely, get decent gas mileage, and are fairly reliable (watch out for the 4+3 tranny's, then tend to fail).
However, I now own a Porsche 911 (1984, see review) and can say that they are a world apart in many ways.  The Vette is what I have come to see as "old school American muscle car technology".  Get a big motor, make lots of torque, and add four wheels...voila, a sports car!  This is obvious in the Vette's design.  Originally it was designed to be a T-Top, but at the last moment (to make it different from the Camaro), they made it a targa (and later a convertible) and the chasis was folding on them..so they added supports in the doorways (you'll notice the hump when you get in).  "Fixes" like these are America's trademark, especially in the 80's.  And the result is a car that although it is fast, looks nice, and handles decent, when pushed you can tell the chasis flexes and rattles.  Similar thought went into the suspension, and as a result the rear tires break loose quite easily, and often.  The Porsche, in contrast, has been so meticously designed that it has a uniquely "solid" feel, unlike any other car I've ever driven.  But then again, you could buy 3-4 Vettes of the same year for one 911.  Which brings me back to my initial point; for the money it's a great car...but it's far from perfect.
