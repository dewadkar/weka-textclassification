            Why did you buy this vehicle?

I bought this car as the car I was driving was basically dieing. and It was going to cost more than the car was worth to fix it.

Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle.

There are quite a number of things I like about this car. My favorite points are the reminders for maintanence. Like a lot of people I get so busy with the day to day things I often find myself neglectfull of things that do not just hit me over the head for attention. This car does that. Everything from lights on the dash to remind you to change the oil to lights on the cassett player reminding me to clean the heads for the best sound. The engine is also well planned and layed out. I can do oil changes and filter changes easily, saving me money on mechanics to do simple things. It has excelent pick up when you need to move and also is very roomy and comfortable. There is nothing I really dislike about this car.

What is it like to drive this vehicle?

Driving the vehicle is very comfortable and solid. even when the conditions are harsh. My wife and I drive from South Carolina to Florida on a semi-regular basis and on top of only having to fill the tank 1 time we were quite comfortable and usually have a good time. Even when we hit a summer thunderstorm in Florida we had no trouble maintaining good traction and control.

Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't?

Anyone who is looking for a good first vehicle or a good family vehicle should consider this an excellent choice. It's reliable, affordable and over all a great car. I wouldn't buy this car if you're looking for a lot of flash or show. but if you are looking for something that's above just getting you from point A to B this is a good choice.<br><br>
