               Hello to anyone reading this page. I would figure that you ae considering buying a Lexus ES 300 or already have one. I am a Senior Certified Technician with Lexus. I have been with them for about 5 years. The ES 300 is a wonderful car overall. From 1992 - 1996 models you have the first generation body style and power plant. This is a car at the time in my opinion that gave you everything you could want for an entry level luxury car. These 3.0 motors hold up very well and aren't prown to mechanical failure as long as you are consistent with your maintence and oil changes. The only negative with this vehicle is a slightly louder whinning noise caused by the vane pump (power steering pump) due to the load demand of running the hydralic fan as well. The pumps do go over time but in most cases you will get more than your life out of them. Major maintence is every 60,000 miles and I have seen these secondary parts (plugs,cap,rotor,wires) last up to 100,000 miles. These cars handle great in the snow and you will feel comfortable behind the wheel. I would suggest a pre-owned vehicle if you are not buying new. Pre-owned may cost you a little more in the beginning but the warranty and having the lexus customer service line behind you will more than pay off if an unfortunate breakdown does occur. I have seen many customers get taken by the used car lots so if you must buy your car from the outside I recommend paying the hour labor rate at the local Lexus shop to look it over before you sign the deal. The ES 300 in 1997 got a new body style and an improved quieter cabin. The leather is replaced in some areas with a vinyl leather material but the vehicle is beautiful to say the least. Some changes were made in the engine area but the core 3.0L motor for keeps. This motor is proven! I personally like the 97 up models better but of course they carry a more significant price. I feel it is worth the few extra bucks. In 1998 the 3.0L motor started getting introduced to VVTi. This is variable valve timing. This gives you more torque at less rpms, which is basically what you feel in your pants when you hit the pedal. If you are looking for an entry level luxury car the Lexus ES 300 blows away the competition. I have Driven every luxury car in this market price from the Audi and Bmw to the Infinity. This is a car you will be happy to own. It is an experience only called LEXUS! <br><br>
