            Lincoln had high ambitions with this car and in many respects they've done a fine job. But, the 2000 LS does not have the assembly quality of a Lexus, the overall handling of a Bimmer or the after-sales care of an Infiniti. 

It is an attractive car that has drawn favorable comments from people in parking lots (even here in CA). Inside the cabin, there is a pair of really comfortable seats and a well laid out interior. It is, however, surprisingly cramped considering the outside dimensions. The engine is quiet but very responsive. I particularly enjoy the torque of the V8 when you need to gain space on the freeway at cruising speed.

Handling is crisp but you cannot run this car along a twisty road like a BMW 5 series. It stops well but I would have preferred different shoes than the factory installed Continental tires. 

There is practically no useful storage space inside the cabin and though I do like having the CD cassette in the glove compartment, when you cannot even get a glove in there it makes you wonder. The trunk is OK and the back seats fold down to accomodate a large parcel.

The gas mileage has been about 19 mpg over 25,000 of mainly city driving but with a tank of only 15 gallons, you spend a lot of time filling up.

It has been reliable, though not up to the standards we now enjoy with the Japanese luxury models. In 12 months, there have been 2 recalls and minor annoyances - heated seat element burns out, seat belt retaining clip breaks (twice), turn signal unit develops a mind of it's own. The service interval at 5,000 miles, puts it at a huge disadvantage versus the newer German models.

By far the worst aspect of owning this car has been the experience with the dealership. They are light years behind their competitors in attitude, turnaround time, care of workmanship and service support. If Lincoln wants to convince people they are up to competing in the big leagues they need to fix this in a hurry.

Finally, this is a well priced car. A comparably equipped Lexus GS 400 (with the 8 cylinder engine) would have cost $10,000 more. 

If Lincoln is serious about competing with the yuppy luxury brands they have made a good start but there is work to do in several areas
