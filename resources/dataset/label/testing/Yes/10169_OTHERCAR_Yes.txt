            Driving this vehicle is really like driving a refined sedan.  It has a comfortable ride and handles very easily.  I initially purchased the RX
because of my past experience with the Lexus brand.  I feel like the quality and attention to detail is unsurpassed.  I would definitely buy
from Lexus again.

The whole experience of owning this vehicle has been great.  I especially
like the control and handling, as well as the smooth ride.  The leather
seats are especially comfortable which adds to the nice driving feel.  The CD/tape/radio sound system really performs although it would not hurt for
Lexus to offer an upgrade similar to the new option in the LS430.  The interior has plenty of room for an average family as well.  My only complaint about the vehicle is that it could stand a boost of about 20-30
horsepower although the standard engine produces adequate power. 

I enjoy driving the RX because it is really a fun vehicle.  It really
drives much like a car and doesn't remind you of a truck at all. It also
comes with many features that are standard equipment that would be extra
cost options on other lesser vehicles.

Just about anyone who values quality and craftsmanship should give strong
consideration to this vehicle.  The only people who should probably consider something else are families with more than 5 members, especially
if they take lots of trips with a lot of luggage.
