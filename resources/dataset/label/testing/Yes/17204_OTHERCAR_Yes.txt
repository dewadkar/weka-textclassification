            When I got married three years ago, I inherited a 1996 Honda Civic.  Working for a Toyota Dealership at the time I was under the impression that the Tercel was a superior automobile.  I was WRONG! I now drive &quot;my wifes&quot; Civic and have found it one of the most reliable cars I have ever owned. I spend alot of time driving the Civic for my new job and although I am 6 feet four inches tall I have plenty of room and am quite comfortable, even on long trips of several hours. If there was one thing that I didn't like about it, it would be the expence to add a factory cassette to the car. If you are considering a economy type of car, you owe it to yourself to look at the Civic, you'll be glad you did. <br><br>
