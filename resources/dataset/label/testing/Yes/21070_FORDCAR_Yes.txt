            My husband and I decided to buy in a family van, since our 87 custom van seemed to be on its last wheel.  I started looking on the Internet with Cars.com.  Which lead me to a Kentucky dealership that had some pretty good deals.  My husband I made a trip over the river to check out these deals.  What we found ourselves looking at, were leased vehicles that were returned at the end of contracts.  They were all 98 Dodge Caravans with very, very low mileage!  Very basic with no power windows, or door locks.  This would not do with three children.

We explained to the salesman that we wanted power windows and door locks, along with two sliding doors.  No problem he told us.  He showed us two 99 Ford Windstar's.  One was white and sporty and the other purple.  (For my husband buying a minivan was showing one's domestication, therefore purple would not do along with the 45,000 miles already accumulated on it.)  So we checked out the white one.  Very nice!  Very well kept for a leased vehicle.  23,000 miles, smooth ride.

Okay now the fun stuff.  We picked our van up the next day.  We were given one key, I asked for the second key and was told only one had been turned in.  Which then led to having to go to a true Ford Dealership to have copies made, (computer chip in key an additional $130.00 for 2 extra keys).  

On my ride back over the Ohio River, I was playing with some of my new toys, trying to figure out the CD player.  Realizing that, wait a minute, there is no drawer for the CD player, but the stereo system says, CD one, CD two, and Shuffle.  I'm excited, I so wanted a CD player in my new vehicle, but where is that CD drawer?  Okay, this is for the cassette player, found that with no problem.  And shouldn't there be a remote key with this thing?  

Finding myself very upset at the prospect of buying not a fully loaded van, as I had hoped it would be, I went directly to the Ford Dealership close to my home.  This salesman was very nice and patient with me, considering that I'm not a very intelligent woman when it comes to cars.  He followed me out to the van, got in, showed me and explained all the gadgets.  To my surprise, Ford, for whatever reason gives you a stereo system with all the CD options without a CD player.  Not only that, what's with the "Theft" light, but also to find out you don't have a security system?  Or better yet, it has one, but it will cost an additional $200-$300 to have it activated.  And say what, it don't come with a remote!  Well, not this models anyway.

Okay, I got what I paid for.  My van has power windows, power door locks, but manual, meaning no remote.  I have Over-drive and still trying to figure that one out.  I have a theft system but it's not activated.  I have air conditioning with an air filtration system for allergy suffers, or non smokers who travel with a smoker (That's a true blessing for me!) I have two slider doors, which I needed and wanted.  I have a van that fits my family comfortably with room to spare for guests.  I have an easy to open and close hatchback door.  I have all the drink holders I need for three children.  Easy to remove bench seats.  And more importantly, I have a great peace of mind.  I have a fine running van with everything I need.
