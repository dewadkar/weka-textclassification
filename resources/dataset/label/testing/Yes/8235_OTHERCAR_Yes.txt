            I really was not in the market for a new digital still camera when I cam across the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom. But its stylish good looks, 6X zoom and other great features caught my eye. The price was very attractive too � at only $399 with a 128MB smart card, camera strap, batteries, lens cap, usb cable and software. The package deal was a real steal.

I love the way it fit in my hand, the small size and its easy of use. I try to always read the manuals but most times not. Since I had a little extra time I did read my manual prior to using this camera. Everything was laid out well and very clearly written. A child could easily make use of the manual and camera without complications.

My first pictures with the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom were on a snow day. We all know how difficult it is to acquire high quality pictures under these conditions. But the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom came through with astounding results. Just using the auto mode. The pictures taken looked like they belonged on a calendar "at least that's what my friends and family said". I think so too.

With the 2.1 pixel Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom, resolution of 1600 x 1200 you can develop images up to 20 inches by 30 inches. Even at this size your images look superb. Yeah! An expert will be able to tell the difference. But for a camera that clearly rivals any regular 35mm on the market � you will be impressed.

The Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom acts like a bridge SLR 35mm camera. It offers the conveniences of a point and shoot � and some professional features with manual control settings. The through-the-lens viewfinder is a terrific aid when framing your shot. Though most professional photographers may pass this baby by. For the novice and intermitted user. It's a diamond waiting to be found.

If you like point and shoot cameras and want the ability to be creative down the road with your photography. At a price point that reasonably compares to the cameras features. Then the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom is one definitely to consider.

After taking a little over a hundred pictures. The evil spirits of digital camera quandaries arrived. These pesky little demons punctured my spirits. For some unknown explanation the function buttons began reacting queerly. I hadn't had the camera 30 days before the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom began its erratic behavior. 

The LCD/Viewfinder button would not switch between the two modes. Yet it began functioning as the menu button. The menu button stopped working and the scroll buttons would only operate in one direction. Though the camera had fresh batteries � I removed them as stated in the manual for the camera to reset. Then I replaced batteries back into the unit. The Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom would not reset even when power was removed for over a 24 hour period.

Unfortunately, I had to return the camera. But another Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom is on the way. The store was out of stock.  I don't believe the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom is defective in general - just the unit I had. But should I discover later  a similar problem with the replacement. I'll update this epinion.

UPDATE:

As I promised an update to this review would come. 

I have been using my replacement Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom a several months now. The results have been just breath taking. All the camera's functions work properly as expected. I have been so elated with the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom that I use it regularly. Much more then I ever expected too.

The bugs I experienced with the first Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom unit were isolated to that particular unit itself.

Should you be looking for your first digital camera, a replacement, or a compliment to your present cameras. The Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom is an excellent choice for you to consider. It's small size, contemporary styling, and multi-personality functions are a great value.

Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom is not just a digital camera. It's also a web cam and mini movie recorder. I've seen digital cameras with similar features at much higher pricing. But for my general needs this camera is more then I'll need for some time.

The only two features not present on the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom I would like to see on it is: ONE � a video out to television. TWO � the ability to add filters or other lenses.

Normally I include specs with my review but this time you will need to visit Fuji.com.
