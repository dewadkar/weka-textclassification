            Let me start off by saying the Isuzu Rodeo and Amigo(Rodeo Sport)are excellent vehicles.In my opinion they suffer from poor marketing and slanted reviews from biased reporting. This is my 4th Isuzu vehicle,the others were 1994 Rodeo V6 5-spd.4X4, 1999 Amigo V6 auto.4X4, 2002 Axiom V6 4X4 which I currently own along with the 2002 Rodeo Sport with(you guessed it,V6 4X4).This review pertains to the Rodeo Sport so I will only comment about it.For its intended purpose there is no better truck in its segment.The Jeep Liberty is a new vehicle with higher option content,but like the Explorer what kind of reliability can you expect? The 3.2L Rodeo will out-pull the 4.0L SOHC Ford(I know because I have an '01 Ranger with the 4.0 and 4:10 gears). The Rodeo is built on a ladder frame with seven crossmembers,has skid plates all over underneath, has transmission and engine oil coolers with selectable transmission shift points,low range transfer case, and stout DANA differentials. Isuzu trucks are every bit as nice or nicer than Toyota trucks but don't have the brand recognition. As everyone knows Isuzu builds the Honda Passport. What is funny is market value is much lower on the Rodeo-go figure. I think the name Isuzu does not "translate" well to Americans as it sounds cheap to some. Anyway,the Rodeo Sport drives very nice and solid, has firm suspension like it should, and comes with a 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty that you will likely never use. Yes, it's not ideal if you're regularly hauling passengers in the rear seat as the entry/exit is tight(maybe that's why they offer the 4 door Rodeo?) But for an outdoorsey couple who likes to truly go off-road or tow a trailer up to 4500 lbs. it deserves serious consideration. If you're the soccer mom type get the Escape or the RAV4. Or if you can stand the styling, the Pilot. From my perspective, you can have your thumb sized axles, I'll take the Rodeo. By the way, I have been a Ford mechanic for 16 years. Your Rodeo will not need a new transmission or head gaskets at 45,000 miles,nor will you need to have recalls performed on a regular basis. You can pretty much guarantee the Rodeo will go 150,000+ miles  with routine maintenance.And that says something.
