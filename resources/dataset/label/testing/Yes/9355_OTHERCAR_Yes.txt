            I was looking to upgrade my Nikon 600 'Point and Shoot' digital camera and wanted something more akin to an SLR. Not being a professional photographer (or even aspiring to be one) I didn't want to pay anything over $1500.

My first choice of camera was one of the new Sony Cybershot series but they were overpriced and were handicapped by a measly 1.5 Megapixel CCD. Also, I'd tried one in the Sony Metreon in San Francisco and although it was the coolest camera I've ever seen, it didn't fit that snugly into my hands (freakishly small hands I guess).

In the end, the price of the Olympus C-2500L combined with a wealth of features and a SLR design was what persuaded me to part with my hard earned money.

I purchased the camera from Cameraworld.com for $1300 and they through in a USB SmartMedia Reader-Writer and a 1.45x Teleconverter Lens. Of course, I had to call and e-mail Cameraworld several times before they actually sent those included items; originally they just sent the camera and &quot;forgot&quot; the rest of the order. Oh well, all's well now.

The camera is a beautiful thing to behold and every feature is readily accessible. I like the total control I can exercise over the exposure and shutter speed. I wish their were more than 4 F-stops but you can't have everything. Even the Flash can be intensified or weakened.

Cycle time between shots on High Quality (i.e. TIFF or JPEG 1712x1368) is only a few seconds. I just tested the camera and got off a shot every second for 5 shots. Then the cycle time grew to something more like 3-5 seconds as the camera tried to write to the disk. Compared to my old Nikon 600, this is a huge improvement. I often waited in excess of 10 seconds for each shot.

The camera also has a burst mode which allows a rapid 5 shots by keeping your finger on the shutter release button.

The 3x optical zoom could be higher like the Sony's 5x zoom, but it's sufficient and really aids composition. Reviewing the photos you've taken is a pleasure on the 122,000 pixel LCD which is sharp enough to see every detail. Using the zoom lever, you can digitally zoom up to 4 times into each shot (but not scroll around within it unfortunately) or zoom out and see up to 9 pictures at a time.

Overall, this is a great camera and I am really enjoying using it despite a negative buying experience through Cameraworld.com. There are fun features like the remote control so you can be in the picture as well as take it. The tiny remote allows basic zoom and snap.

I wish this camera was $1000 and I've seen it for $1079 some places. In the end though, $1300 for such a great camera is probably OK. If you don't crave an SLR format and feature-set, you might try the Nikon 950, otherwise the Olympus C-2500L would be a good investment. With so many cameras out there, it's hard to know if you've gotten the best deal and the best camera for your needs and money. All I can say is - the pictures off the C-2500L are large and detailed, beautifully rendered and written to the SmartMedia disks (a 32MB card is included - thank you Olympus)very fast.

My only gripes are why does the AC adapter come as an expensive ($42) extra and why a serial port input for a camera that takes half a megabyte photos? I got the USB SmartMedia Reader-Writer with my purchase and it downloads in an instant (12 mbps).
