            As the lease on my 1999 VW Jetta ended, I knew I was never going to drive anything but a Toyota product ever again.  I wanted to test drive the new Corolla just to try it out but the dealers in Massachusetts are pre-selling them and have none on the lots so I looked at the SUV I'd wanted but thought was too pricey previously - the RAV4.  Not only is it not pricey (compared to the VUE and CRV, the others I looked at) but seemed much more comfortable and well designed than I was expecting.  I'm 5'9" but have driven friends over 6'3" around and they even have head and leg room.  The dash is easy to read with a cool orange retro look.  The only negative is that the odometer and tachometer are one and the same so you can't see total mileage and miles driven on a given tank of gas at the same time.  The cd player/cassette/radio is great.  I can pull in NY and occasionally Philly and Baltimore radio stations pretty clearly - the Toyota radio is tops - much better than I expected. 6 speakers come standard and sound is good.  Lots of little compartments throughout the cockpit area to store stuff - sunglasses, maps, change, etc.  One thing that's strange is that the jack, instead of being located in the cargo area, is under the passenger front side seat.  Now that I know it's there, not a problem.  The RAV4 comes with a full size spare and tires that are top of the line Toyo.  Much better than the Goodyears I was used to.  Power steering is easy - handles well on corners, city streets and highways. I really like the cruise control - using that has gotten me 27 mpg on highway trips.  I'm averaging 23 on city streets.  Not bad.  I can't wait for winter to try the all wheel drive in the snow.  I've never had a car that handles well in winter and am looking forward to it for once.  I ordered the quick option package so the only features I did not get were rear tinted windows and the toneau cover for the cargo area.

In regards to pep, the RAV4 moves easily - you'll do 80 mph without realizing it on the highway but it struggles a little going from 40 to 60 and 60 to 70.  148hp is good for a vehicle this size and the 4 cylinder handles it well, but don't expect to go 0-60 in 20 seconds.

One thing to look out for is because of the popularity, Toyota is not running too many, if any, specials on the RAV4.  Cash back or low financing is not available in many states right now (throughout New England) so getting the dealer down below sticker price may take some time.  I was able to get down to invoice (dealer was willing to show me, and it matched almost to the letter what I priced the vehicle out at on autobytel.com and kellysbluebook.com.  ($100 more than autobytel and $250 less than on Kelly's) so I'm very happy with the deal I got.
