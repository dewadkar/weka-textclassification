            I Bought this VEHICLE ABOUT A YEAR AGO NOW AND IVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER WITH A PURCHASE.  THIS VEHICLE HANDLES GREAT IN THE SNOW.  I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND WE HAVE BEEN GETTING ALOT OF SNOW LATELY AND IT REALLY DOESNT EFFECT ME.  IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO FIT MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY IN COMFORTABLY.  IT HAS A VERY POWERFUL ENGINE THAT MAKES IT FUN TO DRIVE.  IT IS VERY SOLID AND BUILT WELL SO I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING IT.  SINCE IT IS A BIG VEHICLE IT DOES TAKE ALOT OF GAS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE FEW DOWN POINTS OF THWE VEHICLE.  IT IS A SOLID PRODUCT AND WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE THINING ABOUT BUYING A SUV.<br><br>
