            Great van, Minor problems.     I have a 1998 Pontiac Transport &quot;Montanna&quot;.  My van has 32,000 mile.  I purchased it with 7500 miles showing, but I knew the first owner personally.     My Montanna has the 7-person, 4 bucket seat arrangement.  This arrangement is wonderful for four adults and some children in the rear.  The rear seat is difficult for adults to get into.  You HAVE to go between the buckets to to the rear bench.  The good news; after you get in the rear seat there is more leg room than in the rear bucket (or Captain) seats, and they have plenty of room.     My Montanna gets 20 miles per gallon on the road with 4 adults and luggage, and I have gotten up to 24.  The 3400 engine is punchy, passing everything well.  I wish for the 3800 my Olds 88 has, but that might be overkill. Might improve the gas mileage.     The van performs well on the road, handling curves well, and is not as sensitive to wind as larger vans are.  On wet pavement it is surefooted, handling pools of water on the road without jerking the wheel out of you hand.     Problems? The brakes are noisy, especially the ABS system.  Other vans may demonstrate these noises because of the large acoustical space inside.  But the noise is noticeable on this one.     I am having trouble with the LED on the radio.  GM will repair it, but the unit has to come out to be sent in.  For 7-10 days I will have a lovely quiet hole in my dash.  Other than the LED, I have no complaints about the radio/single CD unit.  Lots of punch, and the controls on the steering wheel make station surfing easy.     Two sliding rear doors are not to be done without- the only way to go.  I would be careful with the power door on the passenger door with small children.  When the door gets close to the shut position, small hands and arms may be in danger.     If you need more room than a sedan can afford, but don't want a gas-sucking Suburban or Big Van, check out the Montanna. Great ride, comfortable seating, low wind-noise, good econ<br><br>
