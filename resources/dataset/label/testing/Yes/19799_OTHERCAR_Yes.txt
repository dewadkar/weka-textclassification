            My mom always told me never to trust a pretty face. In this case, she was 100% right on the money. The Mercury Cougar is visually stunning, but beauty is only skin deepï¿½

They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. This may be true to some extent, but this <i>dramatically</i> changed vehicle introduces the theory that the opposite may be true for some members of the feline family.  No kidding, this is one slick new cat. Taking what was a tried and proven (yet definitely tired) design concept and pretty much throwing it out the window a few years back, Mercury has unleashed upon the North American motoring public an entirely new breed of Cougar. A sleeker, sexier, and <i>much</i> more up-to-date sports car is the result.

The Cougar strikes me as a somewhat confused automobile. At one end of the spectrum it certainly looks very sleek and agile, but in dynamic terms it reminds me more of a Ford Mustang, even though it is based heavily on the Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique platform. No kidding, aside from the lower seating position and nightmarish visibility, this car felt a lot like another Ford product -one of which I am not terribly fond, at that.

I know the Mustang and the Cougar are very different vehicles, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was driving what might have been the replacement for the Mustang in the back of some overly-zealous designers mind. In fact, one can't help but wonder what this car might be like with the 4.6L V8 engine from the Mustang GT shoehorned into the engine bay instead of the existing V6. I'm willing to bet Mercury would sell a whole lot more Cougars if they did the transplant, to say the least.

The <i>170 horsepower, 2.5L V6</i> is actually a very nice engine, offering plenty in the way of power, albeit with somewhat sluggish off-the-line response thanks to the adaptive programming of the ECU (engine control unit) in the Cougar. This supposedly desirable (I'll pass, thanks) feature is designed to &quot;learn&quot; the way you like to drive and adapt the automatic transmission's shift patterns to match your personal driving style. This is all fine in theory, but the car I drove seemed to have adapted to someone else's driving habits long before I got my hands on it (which, I must admit is possible since this car had over 2,000 miles on it). I was not particularly impressed with the acceleration from a standstill, although a manual transmission might have helped somewhat.

As you might have guessed by now, the V6 Cougar I drove was an automatic. That's what Mercury gave me, so that's what I tested. I was constantly wishing for a 5-speed, as the automatic transmission in this car felt <i>completely</i> out of touch with what I wanted it to do. Floor the go-pedal and the car responds with an <i>&quot;I'll think about it.&quot;</i> A second or so later, after apparently contemplating the prospect of kicking down a gear or two, the automatic responds by doing just that. Why it has to think it over is a mystery to me. I'll take a 5-speed and shift gears myself next time, thank you very much.

As if to make up for the quirky transmission in my test car, this otherwise enthusiastic cat demonstrated its crystal-clear understanding of the trait for which felines are best known: <i>their agility.</i> The Cougar felt extremely stable at all speeds, and eagerly carved up the twisty parts of Coldwater Canyon, a local thrill-ride of a street here in Los Angeles, California. The car felt agile and capable in all circumstances.

On the highway, the Cougar felt as composed and solid as any number of much more expensive European GTs. I do however, have several major complaints regarding the overall driving experience. First, at low speeds (especially when maneuvering in parking lots) the steering is incredibly heavy, almost as if there was no power assist at all. There is little variance in the rate of power assist given to the driver as speeds increase, although this annoying trait does fade to the background once you reach cruising speeds over 20 or 30 miles per hour. It is only during turns or while parking that you are reminded of the good old days before power steering was standard on just about everything with four wheels.

The structure has a definitely European solidity to it. There is very little bending of the chassis or frame during twisty maneuvers, and I was left with the feeling that I might have just driven a Mercedes, had it not been for the obviously low-quality feel imparted by the materials used inside the car. This European impression might be due to the heavy feel of the steering combined with the stiffness of structure, but none the less, that's how it felt. Of course, the Cougar was designed to feel like a European car, and it does a decent job of trying to do so. However, make no mistake -this car is definitely <i>not</i> a Mercedes.

My second complaint pertains to the amount of noise entering the cabin.  There is obviously very little in the way of sound insulation in this car. Tire rumble was a constant companion that only got worse at highway speeds. This is a trait I can certainly do without. You can hear the engine almost all the time, but <i>car-nuts</i> (such as myself) tend to go for that in a sports car. ;-)

The way I justify this affection for engine noise in a car like this is really quite simple: if I can't shift it myself, I at least like to hear what's going on when I'm too busy to look at the tachometer. I'm personally not complaining, but some people might not like all the racket, especially that caused by the wide tires.

This rumble from the tires is probably due to two factors: the size of the tires (they're wide), and the very solid (European-feeling) structure of the car itself. I imagine there isn't a liquid-filled anything-mount anywhere in this car, although I cannot attest to this fact with absolute confidence (I suspect there might be one or two liquid-filled engine mounts, but I honestly can't remember at the moment). This matters little however, since in reality this car feels very solid and the ride is fairly harsh, as I suppose it should be, given that the Cougar <i>is</i> a sports car, after all.

One of the worst things about driving the Cougar around town is the limited rearward visibility, especially to the sides. You feel like you are buried deep inside this car thanks to the considerable height of the doors, and the rear view is seriously impaired by the (admittedly great-looking) rear spoiler. Backing up into a parking space (one of my standard tests) was a definite challenge. I had to rely almost completely on the outside mirrors and my (vague) sense of how large the car was. Lane changes were equally challenging, due to the fact that the rearward view to the right side of the car is limited by the wide b-pillars and sharply angled rear window (which has that rear spoiler smack-dab in the middle of it).

Overall, I found the Cougar entertaining to drive, even with its visibility pitfalls and the <i>mind-of-its-own</i> automatic transmission. The noise from the tires and engine I can live with, but I'm not sure everyone would appreciate it quite as much as I do.

Inside, the Cougar is <i>very</i> interesting and full of both character and originality. I love the curvaceous, high-tech design elements, but I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the plasticky feel of most of the interior. The beautifully arched and nicely integrated door pulls unfortunately feel like the cheap plastic they are, although they do look absolutely fantastic. This theme of great looking but horribly cheap plastic is duplicated throughout the cabin in almost every detail.

The controls for both the stereo and climate controls leave much to be desired (the corporate bean-counters definitely got their way), as do the plastics used on the dash. However, I loved the nifty eyeball vents for the air conditioning. They felt nice and worked very well. The unique airflow control mechanism they employ is totally cool and definitely on par with much more expensive cars. However, I found it interesting that I could wiggle the entire center armrest console back and forth about three inches.  It felt as though it was part of an inexpensive child's toy, and a cheaply-made one at that.

Complaints about cheap plastics aside, by far the Cougar's worst feature are the absolutely <i>horrible</i> seats. I hope you like super-strong lumbar support, because you have absolutely no choice. The gigantic lump pressing into in my back was actually painful! I <i>abhor</i> the seats in this car (and I actually like lots of lumbar support!). I cannot imagine that someone would ever design seats as uncomfortable as these. Is it possible that function was completely ignored in the name of funky design? Is it possible that no one at Mercury ever actually sat in the seats before signing off on their design? One can't help but wonder such things, as these seats are without a doubt the worst of any I have ever sat in.

On a more positive note, there is plenty of cargo space in the rear hatch, and with the seats folded down there is enough room for a major trip to your local home center or supermarket. The tiny back seats however, are for kids only. I simply did not fit back there (I am about 6 feet tall).  Think Pontiac Firebird, only with even less headroom.

Now for the best thing about the Cougar: the way it looks. Yes folks, this car is definitely a conversation piece. The bulging cats-eye (triangular) headlights and taillights will have you drooling in the showroom, as will the cool rear spoiler and the decidedly feline face. Fords &quot;new-edge&quot; design is obviously the prevailing theme, and I must admit that it works very well in this case. Simply put, this car turns heads and starts conversations at gas pumps. One gentleman in a late 1980's Lincoln Town Car gawked at my semi-metallic green (loud) Cougar and asked me all about it for fully ten minutes. If you buy one of these, get used to this as this is the usual reaction. Even better is the astounded look on people's faces when you tell them it's a Mercury!

The Cougar looks as substantial as it feels, which is to say that it feels like a tank. While the smaller Toyota Celica looks somewhat meaner, it definitely does not have the overall feeling of mass or substance present in the Cougar. This car looks great in my opinion.  Styling alone is undoubtedly the primary reason Mercury is selling as many Cougars as they are.

Overall, the Cougar is a great looking, soundly engineered, and generally well-executed design that is spoiled by a definite case of under-capitalizing the interior design team. Give the interior design people an extra $300 (per car) to spend (I for one, would happily pay an extra $300 for a better interior) in order to bring the quality of materials up to par with the rest of the car and Mercury would definitely have a winner on their hands. Of course, the automatic transmission needs to be reprogrammed and those awful seats have simply <i>got</i> to go. Do not expect this car to win too many stoplight drag-races against its competitors, either. It definitely needs more power, although it is by no means a slow car.

I was reasonably impressed with the car, but I think my money would probably go elsewhere. I might recommend the new Toyota Celica GT over this car, or perhaps the new Mitsubishi Eclipse V6 (slightly more expensive) instead. Definitely drive both before making a decision to take this cool cat home. Rememberï¿½ Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and beauty definitely pales in the face of outright discomfort and low-quality materials.

<b>UPDATE!!</b>

May 24, 2000:
Ok, tonight I had the opportunity to thrash about in a 5-speed version of the 1999 Mercury Cougar V6 --and what a <i>difference</i> a 5-speed makes in this otherwise very average-feeling car! I kid you not, this car is an absolute blast to drive in the 5-speed flavor.

Sure, a manual transmission brings any car to life in a way that an automatic simply cannot, but in his case, the car felt completely transformed. The car went from merely quick and entertaining to an absolute blast to drive in a heartbeat. The 5-speed Cougar is MUCH more fun than the automatic. I personally think each and every Cougar V6 built should be a 5-speed.

If you are considering the purchase of one of these svelte cats, I implore you to drive the manual transmission variant before making the decision to get the automatic. If you don't drive a stick, I can only urge you to learn!!  :-)
