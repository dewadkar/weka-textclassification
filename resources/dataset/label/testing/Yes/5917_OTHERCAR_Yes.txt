            The Isuzu Rodeo is a great car. I purchased a 1996 rodeo, the limited edition. This is a car that you can take out in the dirt and not have to worry about getting stuck. 
I never had one problem with it while it was in my ownership.
And also, for an SUV it was pretty affordable. (Just not affordable for me anymore.) 
If you are going to buy an SUV I would definately recommend this car. 
It handles well on all of the off road terrain, but it looked nice enough to drive everywhere
It also would make a nice family car. Easy and accesible to car seats, and children.<br><br>
