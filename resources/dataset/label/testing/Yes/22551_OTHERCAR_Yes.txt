            I went out looking for a smaller sportier foreign car, but when I looked at the Tahoe it was "game over."

The new Chevy Tahoe is a "real" sport utility vehicle, not like the other wannabes that are more concerned with getting things done in style rather than taking care of business. Almost every automaker offers an SUV today, so it takes a lot of effort to separate yourself from the crowd. However, contrary opinions of what does and what doesn't make a good SUV ,the 2001 Tahoe is head and shoulders above the rest. 

Built on the same frame as the GM full-size trucks, the Tahoe retains the strength and durability of its workhorse predascessors. A complete makeover last year ended up with a Tahoe with enhanced corrosion protection and stronger dent-resistant steel. GM's engineers improved the Tahoe's durability with redesigned door hinges that last 4x longer than the old ones, amd front-end crush cap allows easy replacement in the event of a low speed collision. 

More importantly, the 2001 Tahoe comes with Chevy's powerful Vortec, 275 horsepower, 4.8-liter engine in the base model and 285hp, 5.3-liter on the LS & LT. The power runs through an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Even with this much power, the engines lead their competition in fuel economy and are compliant are low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards compliant, making them more politically correct to drive and to keep the environmentalist whacko Democrats in check. 

The powertrain underwent extensive revisions with the addition of a durable rear axle, strengthened differential case, and stiffer axle shafts (<b>I love stiff shafts :)</b> But Chevy didn't imporve its off-road durability at the expense of the highway drive. An increase (4x) in body-mount structure stiffness 5-link rear suspension, the redesign provides a quieter and more stable ride on every surface. 

Inside - a 50/50 split third-row seat provides cargo flexibility and potentially increased passenger capacity to nine. The Tahoe also has a glut of advanced safety features, including four-wheel, ventilated disc ABS, front-seat side-impact airbags, seat-mounted safety belts in the first- and third-row outboard positions, and energy-absorbing foam on the interior surfaces, reducing the chances that your taller than average friends will smack their heads while exiting (or if you're more into the one-on-one action there'll be less "headboard" shock.)  Off-roaders can order the Z71 package, which gives the Tahoe an a greater assortment of protective equipment. A specially tuned suspension with bigger shocks and jounce bumpers are added along with underbody skid plates to shield critical parts. A locking rear diff and aggressively treaded tires help traction department while a roof rack and Z71 makrings give it a unique appearance. All Z71s come standard with the OnStar system just in case you venture a little too far from civilization. This Tahoe is a bad-a s s truck that will handle itself well thru town too. With a comfortable interior, it makes for a great roadtrip mobile. If you want a sport utility that can handle loads of people and cargo as well as it does a backwoods, the 2001 Tahoe should be on your list to test-drive, if not buy.
