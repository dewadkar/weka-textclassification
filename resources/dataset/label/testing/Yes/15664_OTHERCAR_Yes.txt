            I purchased two digital cameras prior to buying the Sony Mavica FD-91 and I couldn't be happier.  I am especially pleased with the 14X OPTICAL zoom lense as I have taken some wonderful wildlife photos from a distance.

The 3-1/2 floppy storage format is very convenient as I can copy or download photos from any computer in the world.  I can share photos with my friends and erase bad photos immediately.

The only disadvantage is the weight and size, but the design accomodates the weight and dimensions quite well.  There are other cameras with better resolutions also, but the 1024 X 768 resolution is quite adequate for 8 X 10 photos.  It is a little pricey (around $900.00+) and the batteries are expensive, but the camera is well constructed and the batteries last longer than most.

There are few accessories for the camera except a more powerful battery, a carrying case and a filter.  You can purchase a generic case and the filter at any camera store and save money.<br><br>
