            About 20 months ago (and 45,000 miles ago) I bought my Honda Accord thanks to a kind of pushy salesman, and a really good Financial Corporation (Honda)

Looking at a few other cars at the time, I thought I was conducting an educated, and intelligent search. I looked at the Mazda 626, Nissan Altima, Mitsubishi Galant, and other mid-sized imports.

After being turned down for financing on a non-Honda product, my salesman almost literally pushed me into a 97 Accord.

This was black, and seemed alright, but I didn't know how good this car would turn out to be.

I had driven a 2000 Integra (Acura) around for a little while, and assumed that the Accord was the same being in the same family. I was wrong.

My humble, detailed, meticulous review of the car all around

EXTERIOR
The exterior of this car, well... sucks. I much preferred the different, body-colored grille on the 94-95 models. The newer grills before the next body style in 98 are a sort of cheap black that detracts from a possibly alright looking front end. The rims that came with the car I took off, and discarded, for some EX Rims. Even these factory rims still give a soccer-mom ambience to the car. You don't want that.
As you go towards the back, you will see a huge difference in height in the car. It is almost ridiculous. What I mean by this is, the front of the car looks normal for a Honda Accord. very low, bad for rear-ending big trucks (duck). However, the back of the car is a good foot higher than the hood, and my back tires look like they will come off the ground. This doesn't help on the highway. The tires that come factory with the car are too narrow, and need to be replaced with some Potenzas or Sumitomos. I suggest softer tires.
The clear coat on my car is the worst i've ever seen. You need to wax it every day. By far, the back of the car is the best, and it is beautiful. I have no complaints here.

INTERIOR
The Interior of the car is a mixed situation. The interior trim is beautiful, and well shaped, although not too fragile,  or worn easily. Besides the fake metal on the handles which is pealing off, the interior of the car has weathered very well, which I can't say about the exterior. Controls for Air Conditioning/Heat, and the radio are positioned ten times better than that of an Integra, but still lack the forward-catering console of the Nissan Maxima of the same year. Cruise Control buttons are relatively easily to use, and well positioned, although the horn isn't. It is pretty hard for me to be obnoxious while turning corners. The seats are a part of the car where people argue. I couldn't tell you what I really think of the seats. I can't figure out if Japanese people are shaped differently than me, or if they are more racing-tuned for turns/maneuvering at higher speeds, or if you are not sopposed to ride longer distances. The seats suck- but then everyone is different. Speakers are nicely placed for beautiful sound (LX model only has 4) and hook up nicely to my replaced stereo headunit. The center console compartment is made a little more economically than desired, and the back seats have too little room. The interior colors appeal (Charcoal/Black) and the low-situated windshield and dash assembly provide for almost infinite viewing possibilities. This is a GREAT car for older people.
ONE HORRIBLY BAD THING: The power windows are the worst windows I have ever seen on any reputable car. They are slow, and sometimes don't work, and are the biggest cheese about the car.

PERFORMANCE
Unfortunately, I did not get the Maxima; But I will not put down the Accord. You will almost never win a race, and you need to modify some stuff under the hood before you can confidently merge onto I-95. Under the hood is a beautifully constructed all-alluminum honda SOHC motor. It's displacement is 2.2 litres, pumps out about 140 horses, and will definitely get the car moving. This car is not slow, and performs excellently. I am hot-headed, and lead-footed, however, and I can sense every little thing in the car. This is where Honda should have hired me. The Engine, definitely a winner, is horribly equipped. Cheaply, the SOHC, Single Overhead Cam controls breathing for the car, and should have been DOHC. The only way to anecdote this, which definitely works is a COLD AIR INTAKE. If you are poor, save up 50 dollars, and I will tell you what to buy at the hardware store, and what to order to rig your own. My cold air intake makes me push the motor less, gets me decent acceleration above 60 mph, and is a dream in the winter. The car also was constructed with a very cheap exhaust, which I will also modify. After these two changes, and if stupid honda included Variable Valve timing as a standard, this car would be an EXCELLENT performer. Until then, it is adequate, and peppy. Not quick, or fast. Peppy. 

Suspension in this car is excellent given better tires, and has a really good grip on highway or slowway ;D

Steering is allright, but can be aided by lowering the car, which I havent done, or installing lower-profile tires.

Braking is adequate on the LX model. I don't recommend the Four Wheel disc brakes. Although a slight advantage at a heavy stop, the four wheel disc brakes get hot in the back and the front, making stopping from high speeds dangerous, and ineffective. You want drums on the back, discs up front, unless the four wheel discs are ventilated (cooled)
The brakes also are not too well inclined for uneven weight distribution. You slam brakes on the highway, and your uneven weight will debalance the car, and could lead to a hazard.

RELIABILITY
Except for a little sheistiness with emissions errors turning on the check engine light, this car is a DREAM. I have had fords, and this car beats them dead. In almost two years, I HAVE NEVER EVER EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR'S RELIABILITY. This is the best car I have ever owned because of this, and I will by Honda forever because of this. PERIOD.

IF YOU LIVE IN FLORIDA, or the NORTHEAST
The power of the car to the car's weight makes it horrible in rain. Wheels slip all the time, the car slides. The only way around this is by putting another 1500 pounds in the car. Don't do this. this is not good for the car. Buy a big, heavy, Front Wheel drive car if it rains every day. You can tell when it is raining in the car. This is not a good rain car.

Snow - the car was great in the snow with its factory tires, when they had all their tread. When the tires get older, or if you change the tires to anything wider, the car is not the best. Again, the car has too much torque for its good in the snow. What helps the car move when dry hurts it when in adverse conditions. Get a darned SUV if you live in upstate New York or something.

Anyways, I hope that this is the best review to help you. I have spent an hour of my life on this review to ensure that you purchase this car as long as it doesn't snow too much, rain too much, and if you don't have to win lots of races. The 1997 Honda Accord LX is a great car, and you will miss out on a great pleasure if you buy anything else.

OTHER RECOMMENDATION:
NISSAN MAXIMA is EXCELLENT, and fixes the rain and the race probs. It is fast, and heavier than the Accord, and therefore  fixes those probs. This is another Win-Win Situation

TOYOTA CAMRY is SLOW. But, it is real nice, and cushy, and comfortable, if you don't care about speed, and want a nice, reliable ride.
