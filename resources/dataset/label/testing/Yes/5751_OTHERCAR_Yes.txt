            Just picked up a 2001 Seabring Limited model fully loaded.

We did our homework and compared and test drove 6 convertibles in this price range.  The Chrysler Seabring beat out all other models tested for various reasons.  

Tested and compared to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, 2001 BMW 325i, 2002 Chevy Camaro, 2002 Pontiac Firebird, 2002 Toyoya Solara.  All convertibles.

The seabring has a smaller engine than all but the BMW, which as you may know is 8K more.  The Mitsubishi had a larger engine, but was a little too sporty with what seemed like a very cheap interior and a very hard ride.  It also had the worst back seats ever.  They slanted in toward the front of the car.  The Camaro and firebird were more powerful but lacked the luxury my wife was looking for.  The Toyota was more luxurious, but lacked any sporty ness for about 3K more. The Seabring Limited had everything we were looking for.  Power, sporty ness, luxury, convertible, space, and all the bells and whistles.
It rode the 3rd best behind the BMW and Toyota, however, the Seabring had more room than the BMW and was quieter than the Toyota.

The limited model we got was Sapphire Blue with the dark blue top. The first time we saw this combo, it was not our first choice, however after test driving it and looking at it a little more, we really started to like it.  It has two tone leather, with the autostick (which is very fun), a V6 200hp engine, 4 disc CD changer, ABS, and the white gauges are really nice and add a touch of sport to the interior.  

If you can get a 2001 right now, they are closing them out for the 2002 models, however the 2001 and the 2002 are the VERY SAME car.  Only thing changed was some different colors.  

We picked up the 2001 with 26 miles on it for 4600 off MSRP plus the 7 year extended warranty that Chrysler is doing right now absolutely free.  So we basically got a brand new limited loaded convertible with a 7-year power train warranty for 24940.
