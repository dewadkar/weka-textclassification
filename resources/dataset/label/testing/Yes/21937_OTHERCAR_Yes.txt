            My father now owns a 1995 Chevy 2500 4x4 extended cab,and he has never had any problems with it to date (other than regular maintenance). He tows with it every year for camping, hunting, and fishing trips. The engines never give out in these trucks (never before they turn the odometer over! Thats a dependable vehicle. Chevy's as well as GMC trucks are dependable, strong, easily repaired, and just keep going and going like the energizer bunny. They also can be counted on to pull, push, or haul whatever you can come up with. They are not only good for a work truck but they instill a feeling of safety among their drivers and passengers. My family has always owned Chevy or GMC, with exception to a Ford Taurus Station Wagon(major transmission problems) and an older Toyota Camry. I was given a 73 GMC 1500 when I was 16, and now 15 years later my hubby drives it to and from work. This truck has been nothing but reliable. My father owned it for 5 yrs before me.  I own a 96 Chevy Blazer, it is reliable, minus the problems I have with the brakes. It is small, and not very roomy, but it really drives nice and hasnt left me in a lurch or broken down. All I can say, I will never sway from Chevy, they even retain their resale values. <br><br>
