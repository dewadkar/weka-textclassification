            After reading several reviews, I HAD to get this car!  I didn't even test-drive until after I ordered it.  It's an awesome car overall.

Strengths:
Comfortable seats (even in the back)
Xenon headlights
Performance (inline 6 engine is very powerful, yet smooth)
Styling (this car turns heads)
Smooth engine 
Great braking power
Basic maintenance (including oil-changes) is covered under warranty!

Weaknesses:
Speakers (they're good, but not great)
Excessive brake dust

My experience:
This car is fun to drive!  It is good for cruising the roads, and it has enough power to blow by slow pokes on the highway.  It performs extremely well, and it corners like a sports car.  I have no complaints about it whatsoever.
