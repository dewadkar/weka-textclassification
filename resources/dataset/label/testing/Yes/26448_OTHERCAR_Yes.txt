            I bought my 1997 Pontiac Bonneville SSE toward the end of the 1997 model year, in September 1997.  I had wanted a Bonneville for a while, as I admired the styling and had test driven one previously and was impressed with the ride.  I have not been disappointed with the quality of ride and reliability of the vehicle, finding it to be smooth, comfortable and quiet even on road trips, and it has never broken down or been unreliable in any way in the three years I have owned it.

However, I have been a little annoyed with the electrical system on the car, meaning specifically that at odd times the lights will flash on and off inside the vehicle.  I have had it checked out by the Pontiac dealership and they have not found anything wrong.  It usually happens in the winter, although it has happened occasionally at other times of the year.  

Something I really love about this car is the large number of cupholders!  Being a coffee/soda addict who likes to go on extended drives/road trips with other such addicts, I love having plenty of places to put drinks.  Also, the seats are unbelievably comfortable and are a soft, smooth leather.

One thing I would improve upon is its maneuverability, especially when parking.  It is on the large side and is sometimes difficult to manage when pulling into tight parking spots.  If I lived in the city, I wouldn't be happy with that aspect, but as I live and work in areas where there is ample off-street/garage parking, it hasn't been a big problem, but it has been a little cumbersome when going into the city (downtown Chicago).  Therefore, I would recommend it to suburban purchasers rather than those who live or work in areas with street parking.  I don't think it is just the size, as I have had an easier time parking my fiance's car, a Lincoln Mark VIII, which is about the same size (although longer and narrower).   

Overall, besides the few drawbacks I have mentioned, it is a high quality vehicle and I am happy with it.  I do plan to keep it for at least a few more years.<br><br>
