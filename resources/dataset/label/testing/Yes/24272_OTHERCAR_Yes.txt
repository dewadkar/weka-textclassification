            My Jeep Grand Cherokee was purchased in October 1995. By August 1996 I had driven 62,000+ miles...Comfortably, Safely, Affordably, and in a Grand Style, as well.  The Grand Cherokee was a tremendously wise investment. It was very well designed and very much problem free. I have NEVER had my Jeep in the repair shop (I have changed the oil every 2,500 miles, put on a new set of tires &amp; wiper blades. The inside shift for 4 wheel drive is a snap...and performance???...The Jeep has by far out-performed my wildest expectations. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, nor ice, nor mountains or wilderness roads have kept me from going anywhere. It handles like a dream, no matter what the conditions. It is &quot;Sporty&quot; and extremely functional--having loads of interior room and the ability to go anywhere on a mere moments notice. I LOVE TO DRIVE MY JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE &amp; IT HAS EVEN BECOME THE VEHICLE OF CHOICE FOR MY HUSBAND (A PRACTICING OPTOMOTRIST/BUSINESS DEVELOPER_CONSTRUCTION)--&amp; that really says something since we also own : a Ford Dually, a Mercedes Benz, an Accura, a Ford F150 extended cab l.w.b.,a small GMC extended cab pick-up, a Volkswagon Vanagon, a Chrysler convertible, a Chrysler Imperial, a BMW, A Saturn, and a Lincoln Continental. BUY A JEPP &amp; HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE..I DID AND I AM...!!!!<br><br>
