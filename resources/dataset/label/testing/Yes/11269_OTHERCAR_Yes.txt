            While going on a small expedition with a group of friends, one of them was elected to drive us all there.  And when he drove up with his Subaru Forester I said &quot;You're gonna bring a wagon?&quot;  He replied &quot;A wagon it is not!  Looks may be deceiving my friend, yet this is an SUV, haughty fool!&quot;  Well, ok, not exactly those words but I did mistake the Forester for a wagon like the Outback.  And was I wrong...!

The Forester has the comfortable and silent interior of a wagon.  The seats are very nice, with support that conforms to your body.  The back row can fit 3 small adults or two larger ones.  And like a lot of wagons, the Forester has a good turning radius and responsive steering.  But the comparison stops there.  The rest of the Forester has the spirit of a high-performance SUV.

The 165 horsepower 2.5 liter engine makes for good acceleration.  And  for off-road capabilities, the Forester handles well, even driving on a dirt road in the rain which was actually more like a mud bath!  Over rocks and ditches we trekked, and it held up amazingly, taking on the opposition and crushing it under the 4-wheel drive.  It's fun to drive as well as ride.  Since it's lower than most SUV's the Forester doesn't feel like it is going to tip over around each corner.  And that let's you go even crazier in the off-road, no-limits wilderness!

The Forester also feels very solid like an SUV.  Luckily, my friend hasn't gotten in any accidents, but if he did I think it would hold up well under the impact.  The 5, 3-point seats belts would protect the rest of the passengers and for the people riding in the front, the force would be cushioned by dual front air bags.

So in conclusion, the Subaru Forester may look like a wagon, but it truly is a track-eating SUV.  It's fun to drive, especially off-road and can handle almost anything you want to throw at it.  It has excellent performance and handling in all conditions and will protect you if a crash should occur.  So I suggest the Subaru Forester to anyone looking for a small SUV that combines affordability with an SUV soul.<br><br>
