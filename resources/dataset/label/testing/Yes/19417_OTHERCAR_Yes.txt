            I have recommended this vehicle to several of my friends, family and co-workers.  I bought my 1999 CRV in December 1998 after the '95 Pathfinder I had was going to need big $$$ for repairs on top of the huge amount of gas it used weekly. I drove all the smaller SUV's and found that I liked both the inside and outside offerings of the CRV.  The interior of the car is surprisingly roomy and easily seats five.  There are 4 built-in cup holders and a table that you can pop-up between the two front seats which provides another 2 cupholders, plus table space.  Speaking of tables, if you open the rear door and lift the carpet you'll find the rear deck is actually a full sized card table you can remove and use for tail-gating, camping, etc. There is a second utility portal to plug in portable TV's, radios, cell phones in the back also which can come in handy.
Driving the car also provides some pleasant surprises.  It has very good pick-up and quite a tight turning radius as well.  The interior keeps outside noises out and the stereo and A/C make being inside the CRV comfortable.  Everything in the car is accessible with plenty of spots for storage, including a rather deep drawer under the front passenger's seat which is great for keeping all your car documents, road maps, atlas's and the like.  The car is easy to get in and out of by virtue of my 91 year-old grandmother and very young neices and nephews being able to move about without any problems on loading and unloading.  There is only one thing about this car that I do not like.  While the driver's seat has a moveable armrest, the front passenger's seat has none at all.  I do think the addition of a second armrest would be beneficial.  That being said, I think that no matter who you are or what you are driving now, choosing a CRV the next time around would be a decision you'd be happy about for miles to come.<br><br>
