            I recently needed to buy a cheap digital camera for a project. I went to the camera store, planning to buy the cheapest camera they had. It was a little cheesy job with no preview window and real low pixel depth. I decided to go midrange.
I knew I wanted to get a good digital at some point, but was unable to afford what I wanted just now. I looked at the next price range cameras and, considering the selection, which was kinda slack, I settled on the Kodak DC200.

I was fairly pleased with my choice although in retrospect I should have shopped for one with a zoom lens. The DC210 has a zoom, but was unavailable.

The DC200 takes good quality digital pictures, in three formats. &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot; quality. The high quality being 1152 x 864 pixels. If you are looking for a serious digital camera, this is not for you, but if you are in need of a good camera, that is easy to operate, pictures are easy to download and which has a decent storage capacity, this camera will do the job.

It has a built-in flash. It comes with the software you need for downloading and a disk for storage that will hold 48 good quality pictures, or 9 per 1 meg of storage.

The color LCD preview screen on the back of the camera is pretty good and shows a good image of the picture you just snapped. With this screen, you can program the cameras resolution, view previous pictures in three modes - a small window with the images scrollable along the bottom, a medium image which is full screen, and an actual size image you can scroll up and down on with the cursor buttons.

Via a nob on the back of the camera you set all your preferences. The settings are: Capture, this is the setting you take the pictures on. Review, the setting you can view the images stored on the disk. Connect, for downloading the images to your computer or to the developer, and preferences, where you set all the cameras features.

The images are sharp and clean and perfectly fine for amateur photographers and normal snapshot type situations. I would suggest getting the DC210 with the zoom lens though, as it would be a bit more versatile. I do not know how much more that feature would run, though. I paid about $250.00 + tax, which isn't too bad considering some of the next price range cameras run about $500.00 to $1000.00.<br><br>
