            My dad rented a 00' Chevy Silverado 1500 w. extended cab.  It had a 5.3 L V8 which produced enough power that a truck could ever need.  It had a third door, which was nice, it would of been nicer if it was a four door.  The back seat of the Silverado had more room than my parent's Ford Contour.  I live at the Grand Canyon and it snowed here, and the truck had four wheel drive, which was nice.  I suggest not to drive in four wheel all the time because it will mess up your four wheel drive.  The only thing that I did not like about it was that it was a pain to change the tire if you had a flat.  It was not clear how to remove the jack and necessary tools to change the tire from behind the back seat.  Another difficult thing was to lower the spare that was under the bed.  The instructions were not very clear on how to lower the tire and the tool used to lower the tire was not the best idea Chevy came up with.  Overall, this is a great truck.  It is very comtfy and has plenty of power.  <br><br>
