            I was very impressed by the quality of the pictures. the 5 Mega-Pixel resolution is great. The resolution was what I was looking for. Also, I have big hands and the camera fits my hands very well. It might, however, be a little too bulky for someone with small hands. I took my camera to an amusement park and took a picture from the top of a rollercoaster and got a great picture, but I was worried because of the limitations inherent with a CD. I am nervous about using the camera for taking active pictures with a CD spinning inside. I am worried about crashing the laser lens into the CD and ruining the entire disk. I have also had problems using the disk from the camera in a computer. I don't, however, know if the problem lies with the camera, with my computer CDROM, or with the actual CDRW disk that came with the camera. Another potential problem is that the CDs only hold 152MB of data. While that is still a large amount of data, other cameras can support a 256MB flash card that doesn't have to be finalized before being swapped out. Another problem is that the finalization process has to be performed on a level surface free of vibration. I would forget about swapping CDs out in a car for fear of ruining the disk. This, so far hasn't been a problem for me since the camera can also transfer the images to the PC via a supplied USB cable. The process requires installing software onto the PC, but after the installation, the transfer of images is fast and painless. The zoom is rather lame while using the full resolution, and the zoom on lower resolutions really degrades the quality of the picture. I didn't get hung up on this since the camera supports different lenses, so if I wanted to swap out lenses for, say, a telephoto lens, I could. The menus are very self explanatory, and I was able to use the basic functions of the camera right away. The camera comes with many advanced features that are over my head as a novice photographer, but they are very easy to use, and as such, I am learning quickly to get more out of my camera. The camera takes great pictures in low light using the variable flash and IR focusing. I haven't mastered getting a good picture without a flash in low light, but that might be my fault and not the camera's. I bought my camera at Best Buy as they were running a promotion for no interest financing until July 2004. Overall, I would recommend this camera. It takes great pictures and is very easy to use. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.
