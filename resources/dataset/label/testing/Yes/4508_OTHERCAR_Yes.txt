            One thing that has driven me crazy in the automobile industry is that vehicles are getting smaller and smaller. I am over 6'4", and weigh 290 lbs and used to play semi-pro football. I have been forced to purchase big trucks just so I can fit in my vehicle and receive a whopping 10-14 mpg in fuel consumption. 

Once I left the construction business, I decided to sell my trucks (F150, F350 (2) Dodge Ram 2500) and look for a vehicle that fit me and still had flexibility for carrying tools, furniture and kids w/ 4WD and be under $30,000. So then the Honda Pilot came out (we purchased in Oct. 2002) and it seemed to fit all my needs and doggone it, I still ended up paying $32,000 for it. With my Pilot, we had leather interior and all the goodies that Honda EX usually gives you but we found we didn't want to commit sacrilege on it by throwing our snowboards in it or on it or God Forbid putting mulch in the back of it. In fact, if we could legally get away with it, we'd strap our kids to the hood so that we could keep the interior pristine. 

So then we were in the market for another vehicle just for me (the big guy). It had to be something that I could be comfortable in, abuse, get decent gas mileage, 4WD and pay under $30,000. So a baby boomer couple that we are friends with pulls up in an orange, miniature Humvee. My wife was instantly smitten. It turned out to be a Honda (that blew me away - their styling is usually sedate). Our friends fell in love with our Pilot but couldn't afford it so they rolled out of the dealership in this amazing creation. Since he was well over 6' tall, I was surprised he could fit in it. It looked small. So then I got in it and I was blown away. I have a 58" chest, wide shoulders and 20.5" arms and I actually fit (by comparison I could not get the door closed when I sat in a 2003 Toyota Tundra Access Cab). It seems so roomy inside. 

My last truck I ordered with rubber floors, arrived with carpeting and I was ticked off. I always wanted a rubber floor. Now Milo, my Jack Russell who always pukes in the vehicle, will not upset me in the least. Living in the mountains of North Carolina, steep gravel driveways, icy roads, freezing rain...well I'm looking forward to banging this thing up. I know those big flat doors are going to get dinged, but I try to look at those as "adding character". 

What I love the most is the view out of the windshield and front-door windows. It feels so open w/better visibility than my Pilot. The doors seem solid, not chintzy. The tailgate seems solid as well and holds my bulk quite nicely if I sit on it. The power feels good (even though I got spoiled on the V-6 in the Pilot) and the transmission is smooth. My kids love riding up nice and high in the back seats (they love that they can see over our heads). 

Now it might just be my goofy back (I'm long-waisted) but the lumbar support is non-existent and the armrest is useless (too low and too narrow). I'm thinking of laying a 2x4 across both of them (hee hee). There is also poor visibility for the usual blind spot if the rear seats are flat and up against the rear windows (this is not a problem if you do like I do - make your kids stand up through the moonroof and tell you when you can pass). Of course a better recommendation is if you know you're going to be picking up something bulky, just take the two rear seats out before you leave home. 

All in all this is the best vehicle conceived in years. Everything I wanted came in the EX 2004 model and was priced just right. $21,090.00 w/Auto,4WD, EX. 

P.S. Some goofy phrases my wife and I use: Wannabe Humvee, My Daddy is a Hummer, the Trucklet.
