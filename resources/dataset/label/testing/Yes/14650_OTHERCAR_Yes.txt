            I had a 1991 Hyundai Scoupe, 1.5 L engine with auto transmission.  I bought it used in 1994 with 38K on it.  I just sold it (03/00) with 112K on it.  It was a very good car. I paid about $6000 for it in 1994.  I sold it for $1300.  I put probably about $4000 into it over the years in maintenance.  
    It drove great.  The acceleration was a little crappy and it pinged a lot on hard acceleration, but otherwise it was A-OK.  It had fantastic cornering. Better than most sports cars.  And it was a Hyundai.  I think Lotus designed the suspension for it. I also had Pirelli P4000 tires on it (soft w/ excellent traction) so that added to the cornering ability.  It handled very well.  I can think of at least 5 serious accidents I avoided due to its great handling (and 1 that I didn't!)  The body was in great shape, no rust, held up well.  It was comfortable inside.  Enough room up front, hardly any in back.  Only meant for 2 people on a regular basis.  The stock radio was good enough that I never replaced it with an after-market model.
   I only had 1 major problem.  The trans started slipping with less than 50K on it.  I had it repaired under used car warranty, but it completely gave out less than 10K later.  Had to have the transmission overhauled for a cost of $1500 but no problems in the last 60K.  
   This car was well designed.  It was very easy to fix.  I fixed just about everything myself (except trans).  And I'm not a mechanic. The car was put together logically.  Some cars aren't (I've seen how fords are put together).  I did all the routine maintenence myself also with a minimum of hassle. Great gas mileage (~25-30 mpg on regular 87 octane gas) 
    Finally, my car was chrome yellow.   At first I was hesitant, but got to like it alot.  Not many cars are made that color (Audi, Nissan Xterra, Geo Storm, few others)  and it really stands out.  Overall, a good car for the cost and very reliable if you maintain it (as with anything)
