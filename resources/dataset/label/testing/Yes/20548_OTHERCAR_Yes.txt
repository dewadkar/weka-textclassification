            I first fell in love with car back in the early '90s when the little dog was singing &quot;My Integra...yeah&quot; in the back window.  I bought my '99 Integra LS in May, 1999, and I have not been in the least disappointed.  It is a zippy car for its size at 142hp with a 1.8L engine. With my 5 speed stick shift, I've been known to make even the most arrogant sedan drivers eat my dust!  Since I am a tall gal, I am equally satisfied with the ample amount of legroom for front seat passengers.  However, the back seat legroom leaves a lot to be desired.  The factory sound system is clean and crisp, and a cd player comes standard now.  I also am pleased that they have nicer factory rims on the 99 models than on previous base models.  

Another nice point is the service that I received both on the sales floor and in the service center.  In both areas, I was treated with the utmost courtesy and respect, they took the time to explain every detail, and overall, they made sure that I was happy in the end.  My personal experience with the service department was for a paint problem on my hood, caused by an untimely run in with some bird's dinner.  The remains he left me ate away at my paint all the way to the metal.  The national Acura rep (for lack of a better term) took a look at it, and decided not to accept my claim because they had a similar claim recently, and I guess they did not want a trend of claims over this.  My local service manager was appalled at his decision, and decided that his service center would cover the costs of the warranty repair (yes, the paint IS in the warranty), and they even let me have a loaner car while my hood got repainted.

My only regret is that I didn't get the GS-R model, but I really didn't want the leather seats.  But if you can get past the speed traps, and you don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a great sports car, then this car is for you!<br><br>
