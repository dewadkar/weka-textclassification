            I wanted an Isuzu truck when I was 14.  By the time I was 19 I was finally able to buy one and I couldn't be happier.  I've had my truck almost a year now and it has been everything you could ever want from a truck.  I drove it from North Carolina to Iowa and it was just as comfortable as riding in a roomy car.  I have had no problems with it yet, and I don't foresee any in the immediate future.  The only downside to owning an Hombre is that accessories are hard to find.  That is mainly because it isn't as popular as the other trucks.  I recommend this truck to anyone who is looking for a nice, sporty truck, but doesn't want to fall into the S-10 or Ford Ranger bandwagon.<br><br>
