            I pondered, wondered and finally just didnt do it!! I was very close in purchasing this truck, I worked out a deal on a 2001 Frontier 4wd king cab but just couldnt come down 1750.00. I test drove this truck 3 times and found it to be a solid competitor. The new look was definately for me! The truck came with 16&quot; rims (standard on this model), abs, buckets seats, power windows and locks, cd, auto 3.3l, bed extender (nice option), and much more.  The engines is quite powerful and is geared perfect. It shifts without missing a beat! Its 170 horsepower which is excellent for its class.  The trucks suspension was solid and was responsive to quick turns and off rd terrain.  The instrument panel is nicely laid out and is easy on the eyes. The buckets seats felt like you were in a car but I like the split bench in the Ford Ranger for extra room or width. I ended up with a 2001 Ford Ranger with the same options (Ford came with a couple extras except a bed extender).  Ford was almost 2k less so I ended up buying.  Both have plus' and minuses.  The Nissan biggest plus is its engine and look.  The Nissan fails where most compacts do: the rear seats.  Of course the crew cab is the way to go but the extra 4k just couldnt be done and Im not sure I could part with 2ft less in the bed.  The interior felt a little more cramped in the Nissan but the the ride was smoother than the Ford.  I wonder how all the flares (plastic) will hold up over time and handle the road grim and dings! That was a big question on my mind--Seemed that it could show it wear.  The towing capabilities is the best in its class, 5000 pounds.  Not sure if its tow ready like the Ford. The 4 wd system is on demand and shift smoothly and works like a charm.  Engine and wind noise is about the same between the two as well.  Nissan is known for great resale value and has proven track record for relabilty.  See my detailed Ford Review if interested. Good Luck. Nice Truck!<br><br>
