            I got a Kodak DC 215 Zoom Digital Camera for my birthday.  I had been wanting a digital camera for some time and I was finally able to get one.  I got mine at Best Buy.  I talked to the salesman about all the cameras and asked what he recommended for a beginner.  He told me that the Kodak DC 215 Zoom was his favorite.  I got one!

I got home with the camera, took it out of the box, put some batteries in it and was able to start taking pictures.  This camera is a point and shoot camera, it is so easy to use.  It operates on 4 AA batteries.  The first picture I took turned out really good.

I got my camera in March and have already taken over 500 pictures.  You save a lot of money on film and development with a digital camera.  The camera has a memory card that holds the pictures.  I have been using good quality and with this selection the card holds 54 pictures.  Good quality is great for putting pictures on the Internet and e-mailing them, which is what I do most.  The file size is small so it doesn't take long to send the pictures.  

When you want to put the pictures on the computer, all you do is plug in a cord to your camera and your serial port.  The camera comes with a program called Adobe Photo Deluxe, Home Addition.  This is the program that you can use to transfer your pictures from the camera to the computer.

The options that are on the camera for quality are best, better and good.  Best is what you want to use for portraits.  You can print a quality 5x7 picture using best.  With better you can print photos up to 4x6 size.  And good is for e-mailing pictures or using them online.

This camera also has a resolution choice.  High is what you want to use when you are going to print your pictures.  High is 1152 x 864 pixels.  Then there is standard, which is what I use.  Standard is good for printing small pictures or for using the pictures online or sending them in e-mail.

There are many more features on this camera.  One feature is adding a template.  A template is like a frame, you can add around your picture.  I don't use this feature very often.  You can also put the date on your picture.  I use this feature a lot.  With my 9 month old son, I can look back at the pictures I have taken over the past few months and know exactly when I took them.

There are two image file type selections.  There is JPEG which is good for displaying and printing your pictures.  JPEG is what you want to use for putting your pictures on the Internet or e-mailing them.  The file size is smaller than other picture files.  There is also FLASHPIX setting.  I have never used this setting, but they say it is ideal for displaying and printing your pictures.

With this camera you can take a picture and if you don't like it, you can delete it right then.  You can also view all the pictures on the camera and delete any you don't like.

There are several options for the flash.  There is auto, which uses the flash automatically when needed.  This is the main flash setting.  Fill uses the flash for every picture taken.  This is ideal for pictures taken outside in the shade.  Redeye, the flash flashes twice, once for the eyes to become adjusted to the flash, then again to snap the picture.  Fill Redeye combines fill and redeye features.  Off, the flash does not go off.  I use the auto and redeye features for most of my pictures and have had great results.  Justin is a little ham and he will pose for pictures, at 9 months, he already knows that it is the second flash that takes the picture.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to use pictures on the Internet.  It is a great camera.  Follow this link to see one of the pictures I have taken with the Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera.
