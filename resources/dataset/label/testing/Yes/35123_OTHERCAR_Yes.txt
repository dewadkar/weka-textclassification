            We recently bought a Buick Regal.  We got the 2-door Custom model, in mint condition.  There is not a mark or a defect inside or out on this car, and to look at it, one could be led to believe that it is the 2000 model Regal.  But in actuality, this vehicle is the 1996 version!

The gas mileage on this car is good, averaging about 20 mpg in the city, and nearly 30 mpg for highway driving.  Features include recliner driver seat, driver air bag, cruise control, dual exhaust, AM/FM stereo with cassette player, automatic locks and windows, as well as individual climate control.  This vehicle seats six, and has the fold-down divider in the front seat which contains a beverage holder.  The '96 Buick Regal has plenty of &quot;intestinal fortitude&quot; with six cylinders and has better-than-average pick-up.  This car also sports the anti-theft deterrent system, in the form of a special key (another break for your insurance!).  Tons of trunk room also makes the Regal a good car for long-distance driving.

Our first trip in our '96 Regal was about four hours long, and we were very happy with its performance.  Our two children had plenty of room in the back for napping and reading.  There is plenty of leg room, both in front and in back.  The ride was smooth and comfortable, and for once, I actually look forward to our next long trip in that car!  (That is something I could never say before!!!) It is a solid car, very sturdy and we all felt very safe and secure inside it.  

This car is a gem, and it was a good investment for us.  It has a lot of years left in it, and I am so glad we waited until we found the right vehicle for our family.  We could have bought a new car, but this car had half the price tag of a new car, and still has loads of life left in it.  It was a great find, and I'm confident that our '96 Buick Regal will continue to prove itself over the next few years.
