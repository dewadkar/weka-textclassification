            I only bought my Venture 2 weeks ago, but already love it!  Our 3 children just didn't fit in our old Dodge Daytona anymore and decided it was time to stop taking 2 cars for our outings.  

The 97 Chevy Venture does not have very much space in the cargo area, and the back seats are a bit more cramped than I had expected, but the front seats are very roomy and comfortable.  It rides very nice and quiet.  I haven't had a chance to see how it handles in the snow yet, but we did have 1 icy day and it seemed to handle just fine.  The child safety door locks are a big plus, no more worrying about the kids opening the doors while moving.  It also has rear heat and air controls.  The cup holders are a bit much though.  I hear there are something like 17 of them, have only found 9 of them so far.  For a 7 passenger car, do we really need that many?  The removable seats are great for those Home Depot stops.  They're very easy to fold and remove and only weigh about 38 pounds each.  I'm very happy with this car and would highly recommend it.<br><br>
