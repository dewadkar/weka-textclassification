            This is the 6th or 7th digital camera that I ever use after my last one was FinePix 2300 get stolen few weeks ago (very sad as I still have my latest Australian trip pictures untransferred yet).

Let's jump straight to the business.

Size:

At the size of a box of namecard, this is the smallest digital camera I ever own. Lightweight, easy to carry and use with single hand.

Power:

Powered by two AA batteries, no worries of running out power. You can just go to nearest shop to buy batteries or keep some spare in your pocket with few packs of inexpensive alkalines should you need extended power. Me myself like to use rechargeable AA battery. I bought 4x GP batteries come with the charger, so I can use two of them while the other two are on the charger, ready for the next day shots.

Picture quality:

Idiot proof settings for good quality pictures. Just set to auto and enjoy color rich and sharp memorable picture. The closet competitor to this model from Nikon is Coolpix 775 which is suffer for 'slowness' and poor quality in taking moving objects (<a href="/content_51382619780">http://www.epinions.com/content_51382619780</a>). On the other hand A203 can take sharp still picture of running children or cars moving on the road.

It has 3 options for quality setting:
- 1 Mega pixel 
- 2 Mega pixel - Normal
- 2 Mega pixel - Fine

I found that 1MP quality is still acceptable and does not produce much noise under normal or good lighting (daylight).

For night shooting, A203 offers flash with several modes like red-eye reduction, always on, forced off, slow sync for different kind of scenes. The slow sync is good for taking pictures with city lighting at the background.

The camera is very light and tend to be shaky. If you need to have longer exposure you will need a tripod or put on a stable object like table or cabinet. 

When tripod or table is not available you can try my trick: <i>hold the camera using your hand, point to the target, but don't use your finger to trigger the shutter, no matter how iron hand you are it will still shaking, instead use the self-timer and hold your hand and breath when the counter about to reach zero!</i>

Video:

The A203 is able take video with low resolution at 320x240 pixels, low frame rate and NO AUDIO. Anyway I don't really use this feature. If I really want to take videos, I would rather using my other little wonder, a tiny Sony Mini DV.

Zoom:

Nothing more valuable in a camera than the optical zoom. This is usually found only in higher price range of camera. Zoom is good if you like to travel and take sceneries. Even you'll find it useful indoor, for example: when taking picture of your kid singing on the stage with the whole class. Imagine if you would have to do it without zoom, you need to go very close or even climb the stage!


Storage:

Unlike the earlier FinePix models, this one come with xD card, the smallest storage I ever seen (in term of physical dimension). Originally it comes with 16MB xD card which is good to take 49, 29, 25 pictures in 1MP, 2MP(Normal), 2MP(Fine) resolution respectively. The xD card with 128MB and 256MB is available in the market, you can try www.eBay.com for good bargain!

Transfer:

Transferring to my PC running Windows 2000 is as simple as connecting the USB cable and the camera appears as hard disk! You can just drag & drop the picture files (in JPG format and AVI for video) using Windows Explorer to your local folder.

Price:

Not sure about new price now, I bought this at around US$130 second hand from a nice chap who always buy the latest gadget and let go the old one at good price.

Extras:

You can use this camera as a webcam (ie. Microsoft NetMeeting) but I haven't test it yet. But this feature is good should you travel a lot on business trip, not only you can take pictures but also exchange live video with your family at home over the Internet using the same device.

Overal:

Worth the money.
