            Well, the Geo, as much as we loved it, was ready for a trade-in.  Sadly, we went to our neighborhood car-lots, knowing that we would never find another car as good as our Geo.  (If you haven't read my earlier opinion of the Geo, it is a 1996 Geo Metro Sedan that we drove half to death, but never had any mechanical problems with).  

A good car becomes a member of the family, almost like a pet.  We had many good memories in the Geo:  vacations, relocating from Ohio to North Carolina, going running around with friends, and most importantly, going to the hospital and coming home with our new baby.  I sincerely hope that whatever person or family that winds up with our Eggmobile is as happy with it as we were.  

So, here we are at the car-lot, looking at the diffrent models and trying to decide what we can afford.  John is set on another compact, maybe a Sentra or a Corrolla.  With two kids and several long trips to Ohio in our future, I am dragging my feet.  I keep talking about a Chevy Malibu.  We walk around the lot and don't see anything that really catches our eyes, until a beautiful silver jewel shines toward us.  It is a 2000 Alero, with only 5000 miles.  It is loaded, leather dash, and seats 5 comfortably.  I open the door and sit down, taking in the new-car smell.  John tries not to look.  &quot;We can't afford this, honey.&quot;  He tells me, whipping out his Price Guide.  John has been doing his homework both online and on paper about car values.  In all our discussions on what kind of car we would like to have, and Alero never came up.  &quot;Oh, it's just a little more than the compacts&quot;  he says in a minute, scratching his head.

The salesman puts a temporary tag on the car, and John takes off to drive it.  When he pulls back into the lot, I can tell by his expression that he is hooked.  We bought the Alero.

Okay, so enough of the boy-meets-car story.  Let me tell you how it feels to drive this car.  I once had a Cutlass Supreme, back when they were huge boats with V-8 engines and double-barrelled carbs (ah, youth!  What a cool car to cruise and pick up guys with, huh?)  I would race my Alero, with its 2.4l 4 cylinder engine and automatic transmission with overdrive with my Cutlass and probably beat the old dinosaur, hands down!  This car not only zings, it zags too.  It handles like a dream.  The ride is so smooth, it is hard to judge speed.  I felt like I was crawling, even when the cop pulled me over the first time I drove it.  (He let me off with a warning)  The description of this car is &quot;Sports Sedan&quot;, and it truly lives up to the title.

I will not bore you to death by listing all the extras, but I will list my favorites.  There are automatic door locks that lock when the driver puts the car in gear.  The car also has a tether latch in middle of the back window-ledge for infant-seat tether straps, and childproof locks.  The trunk is huge, and the back seat will still lay down for cargo that is too big to fit, if necessary.  The driver's seat is all power, six-way adjustable, and with the tilt wheel and lumbar support, it is the most comfortable car I have every driven.  On top of that, it has a CD and tape player, and with its rear spoiler, it looks awsome.  I feel like I have to dress up and put on makeup to drive my son to school, just to fit in with the high-class looks of this car. :-)

Okay, now it is time for a few complaints.  1.  No owners manual, and Oldsmobile wants me to purchase one for $15-25.  I despratly need an owners manual for all the bells and whistles on this car, and I feel that just because I bought this car with a few miles on it dosen't mean that I should have to pay for it.  2.  We have had problems with the door locks.  The one on the driver side refuses to work, and so we must unlock the car from the passenger side.  Again, our dealer dosen't think this is their problem, even though the car has a bumper-to-bumper warranty.  I'd like to see them hassle around with the door locks in the rain while holding a squirmy baby and answering &quot;Yes, Allen&quot; to the 15,000th request for &quot;chocolate milk when we get home, mommy&quot;.  

It is a far cry from an economy compact car to the lap of luxury.  So, I may be the wrong person to judge this car.  All I know is that it flies down the road, and if it had any more extras it's name would be &quot;KITT&quot; from the old &quot;Knight Rider&quot; TV shows.  Poor little us, with a one-income family and two kids, could afford this car.  When I start this car up and rev the engine, I still feel like the young girl going out on the town in the late 80's, and the soul of my beloved Cutlass is alive and well in this Olds.  I just can't believe it's mine.
