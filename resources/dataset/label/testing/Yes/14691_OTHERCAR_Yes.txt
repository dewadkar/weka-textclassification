            After test driving many SUV's of various sizes the Forester demonstrated qualities not found in others.  This was my first SUV so I was skeptical as to its overall handling, rideability, and performance. I have driven this SUV for approximately one year during which time I was able to experience first hand the benefits of the Forrester 4wheel drive system which in all weather conditions performed exactly as advertised by the manufacturer. However, the biggest suprise of all was the gas consumption and road performance.  At highway speeds I consistently average in excess of 30 miles/per gallon even using the cheapest gas.  City driving averages about 26 miles per gallon.  This fuel economy comes without sacrificing performance as the engine performs more than adequately whether just cruising or when a burst of power is needed. <br><br>
