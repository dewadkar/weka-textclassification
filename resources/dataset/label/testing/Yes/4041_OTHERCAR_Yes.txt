            I traded in my 1992 Chevy K1500 Blazer on a new '99 4 Door Tahoe.  The '92 that I owned was a beast.  It was the first year Chevy introduced the new body-style for the SUV.  In the 7 years that I owned my '92 I racked up WELL over 200,000 thousand miles, and all I ever had to do to it was change the oil and brakes!  Chevy definitely knows what they're doing when it comes to building the &quot;longest lasting trucks on the market!&quot;  And the new '99 Tahoe is FAR more advanced from my Pre-Historic '92.  The VORTEC engine is pretty much GUARANTEED to last you AT LEAST 200,000 miles BARE minimum.  And I know my '99 will be a MUCH better vehicle that my '92.  I can already tell.  The ONLY drawback I found about my '92 and again in my '99 is the gas mileage is a bit lacking.  But that's to be expected when you strap a MEATY V-8 onto a HUGE steel frame like this.  It's the closest thing to a tank you can buy for under $50,000.  I HIGHLY recommend owning at LEAST one Tahoe in your life so it can be complete!!<br><br>
