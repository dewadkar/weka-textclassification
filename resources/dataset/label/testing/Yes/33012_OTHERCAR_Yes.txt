            I have about 17,000 mile on my one year old 99 GMC Sierra Extended cab, and have the following to report:
1. Several trips to dealership to try to correct passenger seat rattle when empty. ( had a 92 4Runner before this truck, and as expected 4Runner had no squeaks or rattles), could not be corrected.
2. Hard shifting transmission had fluid change to correct hard up shifts, solved problem at about 80% level.
3. Rear leaf springs needed rubber isolators installed to quiet springs when starting off from dead stop; problem solved.
4. Transmission grumbled at about 40 MPH; dealer had to reprogram computer for electric transmission; problem solved.
5. Just had steering shaft replaced as truck developed a knocking in steering wheel. Dealer says poor manufacture of part; problem solved.
6. About to go back second time as the gas pedal sticks from idle. There has been a bulletin issued, which my dealer did not have, so I copied from bulletin board and faxed to him. As I said, goes back this week to see if throttle body needs to be replaced.
