            My Tacoma Standard Cab 4wd is now over 1yr old, having replaced a '97 4wd Nissan Hardbody. While both of these trucks follow the same design concept, the Toyota has some major pluses that are inevitable, inasmuch as the Nissan was at the end of its design lifecycle, there is plenty of life left in the Toyota Design. The standard 2.7 liter 4-cylinder has V8-like power, and runs at low revs in an almost Diesel manner. There isn't much need to go over 3500 rpm in the lower gears, and at 3,000 in 5th you're going plenty fast. While I was enjoying this truck last year, I discovered that there is plenty of power and accelleration left even at 90mph. It also got me my first speeding ticket in almost 20 years. Handling on twisty paved mountain roads is excellent. Offroad, the torque of the engine means that many obstacles can be taken in 2wd by simply coming up to them and "nudging". The 16-inch tires and the tucked in drivetrain give you plenty of clearance. The automatic hubs mean that 4wd can be easily engaged by simply pulling the engaging lever back. I have a bench seat, small cab, my experience being that the bench seat is actually very comfortable and the bench seat gives me space for all of my photographic equipment. The cupholders are great. At most speeds, interior noise is very acceptable, and at speed on the interstate the large engine is barely audible. Fuel mileage with this engine is excellent. 20mpg is almost constant, and I have seen 24mpg at one time.
Now for the hohum items...The transmission shifts great, but reverse, unlike that on the Nissan, is NOT synchronized. Be careful when engaging this gear! And those awful tires. Somebody must have slipped somebody else at Toyota something under the table. The Dunlop's traction in the wet and muddy is ZERO, thus negating many of the advantages of 4wd. These tires are even poor when going downhill on a slightly muddy road at low speed. They are marked for urgent replacement. Also, handling in the rough on washboard ripples is poor. Because of the short wheelbase, and especially with an unloaded bed, the Tacoma can develop some killer rear axle hop at speeds as low as 10mph. The hop can become a self-amplifying oscillation that can only be stopped by bringing the vehicle to a complete stop. At times, this oscillation is so severe that the frame vibrates and even the front wheels start joining the dance. What is needed here is some kind of mass damper in the rear suspension. In the interior I have no major complaints, except for the cupholder directly behind the shift lever, putting 4th somewhere in the middle of your slurpee, thus always encouraging you to buy smaller drinks or go to that 5th gear. The leather sock with the silly plastic tray around the gear shift levers is a dirt magnet deluxe. (A simple rubber boot like on the Nissan would have been much better). Also, for you folks that like to change your own oil, Toyota and Nissan must have a "secret design contest" going for the worst, most inaccessible, most stupid place to put the oil filter on the engine. Getting at this filter takes some patience.
For the rest just a great vehicle
