            Well the Saturn 4 door sedan is my car!I have a 1999 model,that I bought new !!

The car handles well ,acceleration is great,a bit of a lag however ,meaning you have to ease into the acceleration not moss on it!The drawbacks would be some road noise, but one can remedy that with music which I do!Leg room for myself is great as driver, however a six foot person would not be very comfortable on a trip of any substantial duration,front or back seat!There is a divider between the front seats which makes it very difficult for someone of height to drive long distances!Back seat, theres also not a lot of leg room!Great on gas mileage!Also I have found to defrost takes awhile to get going ,and have certainly put that to the test enough since I live in the northeast!I have owned the car for two years now and I find it a joy to drive ,despite the few idiosyncracies afore mentioned!

The Saturn dealership is a different approach,they have a no haggle pricing,'take it or leave it&quot;,that I found to be a refreshing change,however don't expect to barter!They lay it all out on the table,and that's it!On average its not a pricey car!

With rising gas prices ,I'm glad I own a Saturn!<br><br>
