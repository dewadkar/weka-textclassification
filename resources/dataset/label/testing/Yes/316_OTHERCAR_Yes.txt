            There is no category for the 2001 Xterra so I will add this to the 2000 Xterra category.

I've had my 2001 Xterra SE for a couple of weeks now and couldn't be happier with it.  I had looked at everything from Durango's and Grand Cherokees to Rav4's and CRV's and I felt that the Xterra was the best fit for me.  First off, it looks great, which is not reason enough to buy a vehicle but it certainly factored into my decision.  The raised roofline, the roof rack, side moldings, everything about the looks of the Xterra is cool.  I debated long and hard on the color.  I have always hated yellow cars but the &quot;Solar&quot; yellow Xterra looks great.  Ultimately I chose the black.  

The engine is a relatively weak 170 HP, V6.  You will not be doing any drag racing with this.  If quickness is what you want, buy a sports car.  I found the pickup to be plenty for passing or entering the freeway.  Quiet too.  I have not had a chance to test out the 4WD but I will once the snow flies in a couple of months.

The interior is comfortable but not luxurious.  I like the big buttons on the stereo.  Easy to find and they will be welcome when I am wearing gloves.  Some stereo functions are also on the steering wheel (leather wrapped, very nice).  Having to take out the cushions when folding down the rear seats is a minor inconvenience.  The stadium seating in the rear is a great idea.  My 5 year old likes being able to see out. The SE comes with the electronic locks, windows, etc...  Leather is not an option.  The dealer can install leather if you wish (too pricey for me).

Having the &quot;basket&quot; on the roof rack over the sunroof is unavoidable I guess but when the basket is in, you cannot open the roof and it blocks sunlight from entering.  I wish somehow they could have designed the basket to be able to slide back so you wouldn't have to remove it every time you want to open the roof.

Too early to tell on the reliability but one factor in choosing the Xterra over the Grand Cherokee is Jeeps very spotty reliability record.

Overall I would rate the Xterra a &quot;buy&quot;.   <br><br>
