            I bought a 1998 Acura Integra GS Sedan in May of 1998, and it was my first car ever.  I wanted a fast car that looked nice, and especially since I hang out with the Asian crowd, the Integra is held in high regard.  

While researching other cars, I had considered the Honda Prelude, the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Mitsubishi Eclipse and of course, the Acura Integra.  Although these several cars weren't in the exact price range, they all held good value for around the same price.  However, I ruled out the Toyota Camry because I thought the 1998 model looked more like a tank, and less like their old sleekish model.  I ruled out the Accord because the 4 door sedan was not stylish enough.  Although the Accord V-6 coupe, Mitsubishi Eclipse, and Honda Prelude were very stylish, they were all two door cars, and because I had my friends in mind (for constant transportation going back and forth in Los Angeles), I ruled out the two-door cars because they did not have enough space for the rear seat passengers.  Don't get me wrong, if I didn't have to worry about my passengers, I might have probably gone with the Honda Prelude or the V-6 Accord.  

But in the end, I decided on the 1998 Acura Integra GS sedan.  I ruled out the coupe for the same reason as the other cars, and the sedan fit my needs perfectly.  The GS model comes fully loaded, and has automatic transmission (which is why I ruled out the GS-R model, because I did not know how to drive standard transmission at that time).  I love the sunroof, because it seems I always open it when I am cruising along the small roads/highway.  This was the year that they modified the Integra, because they had smoothed out the headlight grooves (the area below the headlights), because there was a problem with the grooves catching snow in certain areas in the past.  Also, they modified the rear bumper, making it look slightly modified it (sort of like aftermarket rear skirts).  It comes with a CD deck, great speakers (which do not sound like stock speakers at all, but almost like aftermarket car speakers).  The GS especially comes with leather seats, the biggest plus.  Its not too hard to take care of the seats, yet its definitely worth having, let me tell you.

So what do I love about this car?  It has great manuverability, with a turning radius that is not very wide for a sedan.  It comes with a nice set of 15&quot; alloy wheels (rims), as well as good tires (I think it was Goodyear, and offers pretty good handling in the rain as well as for street racing).  I've taken this car to speeds up to 120 mph, and there's no visible shaking as if the car is going to fall apart or something.  Its a smooth ride no matter how fast you take it.  Good cornering ability, and a low, good center of gravity.

Lastly, let me tell you about the great aftermarket for this car.  I would have to say that almost every manufacturer of parts that I am aware of (from reading Turbo magazine, Sport Compact Car magazine, etc.) offers aftermarket parts for the Integra, even this model.  And even if a manufacturer does not have a aftermarket part for this car, due to the popularity of this car, most likely they will offer to model a part for your car.  That is what happened to me.  I went to Wings West (spoiler manufacturer in Newport Beach) looking for a combat wing (&quot;Commando&quot; wing) for my Integra, but because it was a brand new model with different trunk dimensions than the previous model, they offered to make one for my car.  All I had to pay for was the paint and labor, which saved me roughly $400.  Good deal.

Okay, so I would have to say this is a perfect car for a racing enthusiast, because there is a strong aftermarket for this car.  But it is even a great car for a more conservative driver, due to its luxury extras, and its smooth ride.  It comes with cruise control, which makes it good for long road trips (if you want to avoid the law).  Also, having automatic transmission makes it possible for others to drive it for you in case of immense inebriation (in other words, in case you get drunk).  

I cannot see how this can be a bad car for anyone, unless perhaps you are looking for something that you will be taking business associates around in.  If it is a business car, you may consider a more &quot;mature&quot; car like a Camry or if you can spend more, a luxury Lexus/BMW/Mercedes.  

In conclusion, this is a great car, and after you take a test drive, you will feel the same way.  Not only does it drive good, but it really looks very good.  It looks so sporty that most people want to race me when they see my car.

I think I forgot to mention how I found my car, since it could be useful (and then again, I can't remember the website address).  I spend a day looking all over the internet, and I ended up with a site that would describe any car I wanted in depth, plus give me the dealer's cost, as well as the breakdown of costs (as I recall, there was $471 in shipping costs from the factory to the dealer, for my car).  Armed with that information, I found another site had a network of dealers that would offer new cars at cost.  

I filled out the online form, and a dealership salesman in my area (well not quite in my area, but 30 min away, so good enough) called me up that very day.  He quoted me $20,300 (cost was around $19,800), and I went to go buy it two weeks later.  By the way, the sticker price was around $23,000, so doing a lot of research paid off.  Happy ending, huh?

It looks like they re-classified this category to &quot;2000 Acura Integra Sedan&quot;.  Just so you know, i bought the 1998 model, okay?  =)<br><br>
