            When  the lease on our Mitsubishi was about to run out, we decided to look for a used vehicle to replace the Galant and thought we would love to have a small SUV but didn�t think it was possible with the budget we had set, especially since we had decided not to lease again. We decided to visit some dealerships and give them our price range and ask what they had to offer in that range. We knew we needed to have the payment less than our current one and wanted to buy, not lease.

 At the last dealership we visited, which was a Honda dealership, we were shown a 1999 Chevrolet Tracker. It had 6000 miles on it and was still under warranty. Although we would have preferred a hard top, it was the only one on the lot and so we decided to take it for a test ride. Well, we ended up driving that little Tracker home and we love it!

The Chevrolet Tracker is built and rated much higher than the Geo Tracker was, being bought out in 1997. Our tracker is an automatic transmission, two door, AM/FM Cassette. It has power steering, AC and dual head rests. It has some other neat extras also, like an extra adapter for plugging things in, two cup holders, side pockets for storage and the side handles overhead.

This is not a big vehicle and fits into parking spaces easily,  is easy to maneuver and really drives like a car. We thought it would be too small at first but it has plenty of head room, fairly good leg room in the back seat. Speaking of seats, they are a little narrow but will do. 
We would like it to have more storage for luggage. The back seat folds down for even more storage. We also like the tailgate that swings out instead of opening up. It�s convenient for throwing groceries in the back since it�s a two door.

My husband tells me we have a 2.0 liter engine which is very good on gas mileage. We get about 19 miles to the gallon in the city and have yet to take a long trip but it is supposed to get between 20-25 on highway.

 One thing we�re not sure about is the way the lights always stay on. I guess that�s good in the rain, in case you forget to turn them on like I do sometimes. On the other hand, since they come on automatically by themselves, sometimes we forget to turn them on so we�ve got no tail lights. 

The Goodyear tires are nice (a friend of ours tells us that�s a real plus!!). There is a spare tire on the back.  The power option is nice for speeding up to pass on the highway or for more power needed to climb hills. 

I love the idea of having an SUV without it being too big and too hard on gas. I love the idea of sitting up higher than other vehicles and feeling a little more aware of traffic and at a better vantage point. 

This is probably not a vehicle we would have gone out to find, but, all in all, we�re really enjoying this vehicle. We took a hiking trip today and decided to put the top down for the trip home and really enjoyed it. It wasn�t that hard to get up and down either, especially with both of us working.  Altogether I would recommend this vehicle if you just want to have a fun vehicle and you don�t have a big family.
