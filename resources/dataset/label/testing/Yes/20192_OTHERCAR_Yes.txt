            When you hit the front door of the car rental joint, you never quite know what you'll be driving when you leave.  This time, my &quot;mid-size&quot; car turned out to be a '99 Chevy Malibu, the first chance I've had to drive one of these little guys.  So, here's my take (one of my series of reviews of rentals).

First, know that I don't own this car -- I just rented it for five days and drove it about 400 miles.  At home we have two Toyota pickups ('88 and '99) and a '92 Accord.  I got thoroughly sick of Detroit back about 1975 and I haven't bought another of their cars since (let me tell you someetime about my '67 Camaro Rallye Sport ragtop, though -- sighhhhhh.)  Still, I think I can be objective.

The rental had a little over 31K miles on it -- pretty high mileage for a rental car, in my experience.  Still, the car was holding together quite well.  There were no knocks, squeaks, or crunches as you drove; and only a slight rattle on the more corrugated surfaces, like the fresh chip-and-seal streets in my subdivision.  There weren't any parts broken off and only a few things seemed to be loose.  

Overall, I'd say that the quality of construction seems to be much higher than my last few American-made cars.  On the down side, the glove-box door was installed crooked, and there were some sloppy joints between parts in the dashboard. The carpeting was funky -- big gaps around the bases of the seats (is this a GM thing?  I saw it on a Buick a couple of weeks ago).

The ride was a lot more sporty than most cars coming off the lines in the US.  The steering reminded me a lot of my Honda (only not quite as smooth) and the handling was very responsive.  This, in my estimation, is where Detroit has gone off track -- trying to make even their econo-boxes ride like Coupes de Ville.  But I digress..  Road noise was a bit of a problem whenever I got off the smoothest surfaces.  Not only can you feel differences in surface texture through the steering, but you can definitely hear the difference.  Not so in my Honda, by the way.  I hit a couple of speed bumps; the car bucked like my four-wheel drive pickup.  They're getting better on suspension, but I think they still have a bit to learn.

Uppers:  Pretty comfortable cabin, although smallish (not a problem for me).  Well laid-out dash, roomy trunk (mainly 'cause of one of those horrid compact spares).  Good climate control, including vents on the windshield pillars.  Gas Mileage seemed to be about 28-30 for mostly highway driving (a little lead-footed, at that).

Downers:  Slightly nervous ride; even with a lot of experience on responsive steering, I still had a tendency to oversteer.  A very noisy wiper motor, bad location of the door locking switch (or over-sensitive switch -- I kept locking myself in when I reached for the door handle).  A faulty gas gauge kept me guessing (and probably cost me extra at the rental joint).  Nasty little compact spare tire.

It's a pretty OK car by me; since it rides well and handles better than most US cars, at least by my standards.  If you're a dyed-in-the-wool Buy-American type, I recommend this one. I'd want to check out its reliability with the folks at Consumer Reports before I bought a used one.
