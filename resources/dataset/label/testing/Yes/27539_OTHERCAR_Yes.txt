            I have always wanted a Jeep Grand Cherokee, that vehicle always symbolized excellent quality to me. I was very excited to find I could afford a used one. It was a 1996 model, I received an excellent deal from a dealership for it.
I loved this truck it was in mint condition. I took it camping in the woods. I took it snowmobiling in the Vermont mountains. I drove it to go salmon fishing in Lake Ontario. It handled the back country like a hero and not once did I suffer a bumpy ride. The vehicle was dependable. It never gave me an issue starting in any kind of weather. My Jeep had everything I wanted: fog lights, CD player, power windows, power seats, security system, power door locks it even had a small console right above the transmission shift lever which monitored all the maintenance systems of the truck, including a door ajar alert. Wow!! I thought this was great!! I'll never have to check any fluid levels or watch for burned out bulbs again. The computer would tell me when the vehicle would need specific attention. Well that's when a good option started to go bad.
Don't get me wrong the Jeep always performed well mechanically. What had happened was I would get an alert on the console telling me the tail lights were malfunctioning. I would check them and it was right, they were all blown out. No problem, I thought to myself. I'll just replace the blown out tail light for a new bulb. The light worked but the console didn't recognize the new bulbs, it kept alerting me that the new bulbs were still out. So I took apart the lights again and replace them with totally new bulbs. Same problem again I thought, OK, used truck 37,000 miles something has got to go wrong, so I brought it back to the dealer. They fixed it and told me it was a bad connection in the tail lights. Somehow the vehicle's monitoring system detected resistance from the lighting connection which causes the computer console not to reset. The dealership was very prompt and explained everything very well. I was satisfied with the outcome as long as this was not a usual occurrence, unfortunately it became one. Not only was there a so called resistance problem with the lights, it happened with the oil level, and wiper fluid too. After several visits to the dealership I couldn't take it anymore. Every time I would get in the truck it was always beeping about something new. I couldn't get it to reset. I checked all the factory manuals, called numerous dealers, it just wouldn't quit. Finally I resolved myself to the fact that my dream truck just had some bad engineering problems and if it continued to beep at me every time I drove it, it was going to have some bad interior cosmetic problems as well. Well, I gave in, I decided to trade it in for another jeep vehicle, an older wrangler. Things have been good so far. Let's keep our fingers crossed.
Although I had a bad experience with this truck. I still believe in the Jeep line. My girlfriend has recently purchased a 99 Grand Cherokee and it has been performing great. I definitely recommend these trucks to anyone.
I think I just the bad one of the bunch. This vehicle is excellent for anyone who likes comfort, space and does not want to compromise the rugged features for going off road. I still believe it is a great truck for anyone.<br><br>
