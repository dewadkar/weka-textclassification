            The 2002 Mazda MPV LX is a very practical car. It could seat up to 7 people and the back seat folds down onto the car so you don't have to worry about taking the back seat out to make room for cargo space. It has dual sliding doors and the large windows from both sides slide down half way. You could also move the middle two seats together or away from each other. This car has an excellent stereo sound system and cup holders for each seat. The LX model came with a CD player. The sound is so clear from the fronts seats to the back seats, but the sound settings could be hard to figure out so I would definitely recommend reading the manual. Everything else is easy to handle and figure out such as the heating and cooling systems. There is also a small storage space on the side of the back seats. I usually put magazines, maps or lotion in those compartments.


The problem I have with the car is that the driver's seat is not very comfortable. It is one of those seats where you would pull a lever in front of the seat to adjust the seat back and forth. I found that if you adjust the seat to one setting my knees would knock against the steering board, and if I set it to the next setting my feet would be too far from the accelerator and brake that I would have to stretch to reach them. I also had problems with finding the proper back support adjustment setting. I would definitely get the luxury option with the electric adjuster if you could afford it. The passenger seats are comfortable with adjustable back support including the folding back seats. Another problem I have is with the automatic door lock and the window lock that is only on the driver's side. My passenger constantly finds herself reaching over to the driver's side to lock and unlock the doors to the car (only annoying in situations where I would need to leave the car for a few minutes). Moreover, I found it hard to close the sliding doors often, the sliding doors open easily but closing it is another matter. One has to pull the door from a certain angle for it to start closing. The car runs very smoothly especially with turns and it feels very stable, but there is a lot of outside noise when you reach normal speed. Finally, locking the doors with the remote alarm could be sometimes traumatic. If you want the alarm to go on you have to press the remote twice to set it, but when you press the lock button the second time there is a huge honking noise that it basically wakes and scares up the whole neighborhood (I basically leave the alarm off now).
