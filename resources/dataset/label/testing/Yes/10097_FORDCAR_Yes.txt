            The Ford F-350 Super Duty is the biggest truck you would ever want, much less need. It combines the comfort of a Lincoln with the brute power of a Hummer. 

THE ENGINE
The F-350 comes with a V-10 Triton engine, more than enough to tow anything you want. The down side is that it burns gas faster than most trucks. On average, I get about 14-15 miles to the gallon. If you want this truck, you won't be buying it for the economic advantages

THE INTERIOR
The F-350 comes with leather interior, a CD player, a huge console in the front and tinted windows to keep cool in the summer. The airconditioning system, as well as heating, is superb. The interior of the truck is probably the roomiest of all trucks I've ever seen. Even the back seats have more than enough room for three people. 

THE EXTERIOR
The F-350 is one of the sharpest tucks on the road. The cockpit sits almost as high as a semi's! The bed is fairly big, but somewhat hard to load because of it's height. 

THE BOTTOM LINE
The F-350 is a great truck, but it is too big for a lot of people. If your looking for a truck that is economical, this is not for you! However, if your looking for towing and hauling power, look no further.
