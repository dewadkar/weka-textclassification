            Approximately a month ago, we decided to trade our Monte Carlo in for a 2000 Blazer and I couldn't be happier. Trading a 2 door for a 4 door with a new baby is just 1 of the many pluses. Living in a rural area that does see snow, I feel much more comfortable than in just a 2 wheel drive. The new Blazer has a push button 4 wheel drive or auto track that kicks into 4 wheel only when needed. There are many safety features that any family that has children can appreciate as well such as child safety locks on the doors and the windows. One of the new improvements on the 2000 model is a new lift gate trunk as opposed to the fold down gate. After opening the lift gate or lift glass, there is a retractable cover that covers the entire contents so they are not viewable from peeping Toms as well as a cargo net to keep items from rolling around the back. While I gave up on a little bit of gas mileage by trading a car for a SUV,I have no regrets.
