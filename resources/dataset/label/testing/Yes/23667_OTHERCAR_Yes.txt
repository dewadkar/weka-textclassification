            Lots of great features in a small compact relatively inexpensive camera.  Excellent buy for the money, so I highly recommend it.  Very compact size, easy to carry, very light. If you have large hands it is a very small camera to hold and shoot and keep fingers out of the way of things - but this by no means a negative.  Can't have everything in a camera regardless of price, but the one feature I would like to see is a button (versus menu) for the photo timer. Display screen seems to take a long time to restore after a shot like most dig cameras. Like all digital cameras with a display it goes thru batteries quickly.  I was not surprised when the low battery indicator came on after a couple hours.  I was VERY surprised though when I tested the batteries to find they were still about 85% charged.  Maybe someone can address from a technical perspective - but it appears batteries must be fully charged to operate the camera.  Like the lens cover-a must have item. Why is the mem card in the same compartment as the batteries? - may want to redesign that. Lighting conditions can be tricky to deal with, especially low light/flash conditions.  View finder is definitely off.  Depth of field/menu settings can be tricky also, so if you print a lot of shots, you may have to play around with the software.You can find this camera on Ebay for close to $120 or less these days.  Don't misunderstand, this is a great camera. I focussed on shortcomings or less than ideal items because folks are more interested in those things in making a decision.
