            Last year I bought a '99 Nissan Quest.  I had been shopping around in the minivan market for a while and was leaning towards the Honda ones, until I went to my local Nissan dealership.  It was a rainy Sunday when I pulled up and as it turns out the dealership was closed.  I took a walk around the lot and looked at the Quest, a minivan that in it's earlier years I had no attraction too.  I found a silver one sitting in the middle of the lot and was blown away with all the standard features that it came with.  Most of which cost extra in other cars.  The next day I walked right in there and put a down payment on one.  I ended up leasing the '99 sport model for $289 a month and $1000 down.  The car came with great new features unseen in the earlier models.  Some of these include dual sliding doors, a great sound system, a bigger more powerful engine, and the '99 free tv offer.  When you bought or leased a '99 Quest you got a free TV/VCR package for your car.  The &quot;in car babysitter.&quot;  So for the last year and a half I have been driving around this minivan.  At first I wasn't to thrilled about getting one but after driving one, I LOVE THEM!!!  The Quest has great pickup, very comfortable seating, great visibility, and the sport package provides outstanding handeling.  I only wish I had got the optional sunroof and leather seats.  oh well, I recomend this car to any one that's looking for a great minivan.  On a side note, I was just at the NY auto show on Saturday, April 22, and saw the 2001 Quest.  Looking as good as ever.<br><br>
