            I bought my '93 Talion used back in '97 for $7700 which isn't too bad.  I still have the car today.  And up until now, the car has been a good running car without any problems.  Most recently though, I had the transmission replaced for $2200 at Ammco.  To this day I am still in doubt if that was the real problem, only because now it has a serious kick back when shifting, and they claim it's the motor not the transmission.  Which tells me they don't really know what the problem is.

But the car itself is a good looking car, mine doesn't have airbags, but does have automatic seat belts.  It has a power/economy button.  It offers an overdrive button on the shifter which could have been better placed to avoid mistakenly hitting the button.  The car isn't really made for a big person.  The motor has to be the biggest slow dog I ever owned.  When you try to pass a car, the barrel opens up, and it just gets louder, not faster.

This would make a good car for the college student, or teenagers car I think.  But for someone like myself, it's too small, and the motor is whimpy.  I plan to keep the car for one more year and resell it for an SUV myself.<br><br>
