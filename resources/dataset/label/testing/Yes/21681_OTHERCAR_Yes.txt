            We bought a Chevy Prism for our college son to drive back and forth to school - about 120 miles each way.  This car gets great gas mileage.  After two years and 80,000 plus miles he is still getting about 25 miles to the gallon.  We have had no major repairs - only oil and filters - the belts and hoses are all still good.  Occasionally, however, the heater blower motor will quit.  This usually only lasts for a few minutes.  The biggest complaint we have is the rattles.  At highway speed everything inside rattles -  the dashboard - the door locks - the ashtray.  He keeps pieces of toothpicks in the car to put in the locks, on both sides of the radio and ashtray and the heater switch to stop the rattles.  The other complaint is with shakes.  Before he shifts to fifth gear (in third and forth) the car shakes.  Once it hits fifth gear and highway speeds the shaking stops so it is not a bad problem.
For the money this has been a great car.  It is economical to drive, handles well in ice and snow.  And it will go quite a while without any breakdowns.   
When the car was first purchased there were several spots that the manufacturer had missed applying clear coat to the finish, but the dealer repainted the spots to our satisfaction.  
For the price this is a car I would recommend to a single person or college student.  I don't think it would hold up well with children do to the interior rattles.<br><br>
