            The Jeep Wrangler is a very fun vehicle to own, but it is not for everyone.  Everyone pictures the top off and the doors off and the wind blowing your hair around cruising up and down the beach with all of the girls on the street waving to you.  This can actually be true, but for most of us only about three months a year.  Wranglers are a lot of fun in the warm weather, but they definitely take some getting used to during other times of the year.  First of all, they basically have no luxuries,  this isn't necessarily bad, it's just something to remember.  Second they are very loud, especially with a soft top.  If you're on the highway doing about 65, you be lucky to hear yourself think.  One other thing to consider is whether or not you are a commuter of a relatively long distance.  If you are, you may want to reconsider a Jeep.  The gas mileage numbers of 18 highway and 16 local that the window sticker gives are very friendly at best.  I personally get something more in the 15 all the time range.  Don't write the Jeep off yet though, it is definitely one of the most fun vehicles ever made, and it has proven it's popularity by existing for about 50 years with very little innovation.  Personally, I feel that the positives of a Jeep far outweigh the negatives.  I would recommend a Jeep to anyone who just wants a fun and versatile vehicle.  I mean the infamous Jeep wave between owners is alone proof of the loyalty and enthusiasm of their owners.  So, if you're thinking of getting one, and the warnings I gave above don't scare you, then by all means, buy one, you'll love it.  The only recommendation I can give though is to get the 4.0 liter 6 cylinder.  The power difference between that and the  2.5L 4 cylinder is huge.  I have the 4 cylinder, and I really regret it.  I have driven the 4.0L, and it is a whole different experience, not to mention it actually gets better mileage in a relative sense to the 4 cylinder.  So in conclusion, I have to give the Jeep 2 thumbs up, as long as you take the good with the bad.  I'm sure that most other owners will agree that the benefits far outweigh it's negatives<br><br>
