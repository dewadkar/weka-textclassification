            Overall we have been very impressed with the vehicle.  The exterior has a handsome look, it appears rugged yet sophisticated.  (SEE UPDATE BELOW)

The interior is a real treat.   The leather seats are firm and reminds one of a quality leather couch, although we have found a few slight blemishes.  The carpet does seem to attract and retain dirt more than we would like.   It would have been nice if the driver's side had rubber mat inserts in the middle and along the side where your left foot rests.  

There is a bit of air noise at the sun roof, when the sliding cover is open, but it goes away when you slide the cover closed.  The side mirrors automatically come in at the push of a button, which is not only neat, but protects them when you are in tight spaces.  I wish they were a bit bigger (more like the 4Runner's).  The memory setting for the mirrors and setting that is associated with each remote is great.  My wife's keys set hers up the way she likes, and mine are set to my keys.  

The navigation system is a plus, it is so neat, at first my wife thought it was frivolous.  Once she needed it, she thanked me for insisting on it.  You need this system to save gas, since this car is a heavy drinker.  This is the most disappointing aspect, since we were led to believe the mileage was decent.  

All the safety features make sense and you do feel comfortable in the car.  The twin turbos give a little kick, but, if you really want to get it going, drop it in to manual.  The extra seats in back give you some options when you need to transport up to 7.  The clam shell back tailgate is great, I was not crazy about it at first, since it meant loosing the ability to operate the rear window, but thinking back to the 4Runner, I rarely used it.   

The automatic wipers are another neat bonus.  The sound system rounds it out, but is a bit complex to get to the features you want.  The car needs a mobile phone set up, bigger side mirrors, and a better MPG.  Other than that we are pleased, you can't get much better with any other SUV at this time.   Oh yes "Inga" our newly named navigation system could have a sexier voice,...but I'll let that one slide, otherwise the wife might be suspicious on my short trips using it.

UPDATE... Month 5
Here is some new info.; After a few months... the beast  got its first ding, ouch!... not bad though.   Its been in the shop twice now, once for a squeaking sound from the brakes; turns out the spring for the emergency parking break needed to be replaced it was pulling the brakes on the rear when they got heated.  Not a big deal.  A whooshing sound is noticeable when the turbo charger disengages, again not a big deal but a bit strange at first, we hear Volvo is working on it.  Everything else is going fine, except the carpets seem to stain easily.  Gas mileage is better when using manual mode. Still love the nav. system.  Handling is great, it has come in handy twice.  We have used the rear seats with adults twice, for the most part, comments were positive.  If each trip was more than an hour it might have changed. We are not noticing the road noise as much as others, however, we opted for the safety glass which does not come tinted, however, does have protective overlay both inside and outside.  Also, the vehicle does not get as warm as we were afraid it might since there is no tint.  (I think the tint thing is over done now anyway.)
