            About 4 months ago, I bought this maroon colored 1993 passat GLX VR6 5-speed. First observations: looks like nothing on road, cross between corrado and A3 Jetta. VR6 engine is very torquey and pulls hard above 3K. Handles far better than any new 4 door Japanese sedan. Tight, sturdy, secure german feel on highway at 80+ MPH (ie, no overly light steering wheel found on most jap cars). Good brake feel. Comfortable seats. 5-speed a little notchy with relatively short throws. Dont get a auto! Besides the fact that german cars are drivers cars and should ALWAYS be bought with a stick, the auto in this B3 is known for failure. Unless you want to drop $3K replacing the tranny, stay away from this automatic like the plague. If you cant drive stick, go get a Jap econobox (ie corrola). Other problems include the cooling system, which needs to be maintained religiously. watter pump went on me at 119K to the tune of $400. Electric ignition, known as coil pack, tends to go over time and is expenisve ($200). Stay away from VW dealers, they are far worse to deal with and far more expensive than any other make I have encountered. A little off-topic advice, if you are looking to buy a new Passat, pay the extra few K's and get yourself an A4. You'll be glad you did when it comes to service. Overall, my 93 passat has been a good experience thus far, until something else breaks.
