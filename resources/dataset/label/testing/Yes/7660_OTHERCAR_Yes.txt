            I bought my 1990 Jeep wrangler bout a month or two ago and aside from a few minor things i've loved it.

Body:
The body of my jeep is white and has the original paint which amazingly has stood up great.  There is minimal rust and color or the paint is still a bright white.  Some of the accents of the black are faded out but those were easily touched up with some black rustoleum.  I have a besttop soft top on the jeep which is the best top around no problems what soever.  The only problem that i dislike bout the soft top feature is the top is harder to put down than the new models.  Once you get a hang of it you will have no problems.  The doors come off which is definatly a plus, gotta love the doors off and the bikini top on in the summer its great.

Engine:
My engine has about 120,000 miles on it and the previous owner had it rebuilt.  I"ve have no problems with it after that it runs strong all the time and is great for off roading.  I've never had a better car, and for a 4 cylinder it has some serious power.  Jeep definately put togther a great engine in this years jeep.  The thing that i dislike about the engine is the gas.  This thing does burn gas like crazy but i mean its a jeep so what can u expect.  Even the newer ones burn as much gas so if u need to save money go buy a honda.

Transmission:
The transmission when i bought it seemed to be fine and it was strong and everything.  Apparently my service shop thought otherwise.  It cost me about 1500 to replace the transmission.  But i mean it was the original so if u find urself a jeep with about 90k on it you should still have a few thousand strong miles left.

Clutch:
I have just the regular size clutch and everything it has a nice amount of leway and is strong all the time.  The clutch had only been replaced once so if you get a good one and you know how to drive a manual well then you have no problems.

I have aftermarket alloys on my jeep size 15 and then some 31" BFG A/T tires.  They are by far the best thing for the jeep b/c they provide best off and on road.  You could go with swampers but they are loud and really expensive.  The BFG's seem to be holding up just fine.  

Interior:
I love my seats, they are so comfortable, granted they don't recline but its a jeep no need for it.  I have a fold and stowe rear seat which is nice to have if you have friends.  Put some 6x9's in the rear and even if your doing about 75 on the highway you still hear is strong.  The gauges spread across the dash making it nice and light which is a good thing.  I like the gauges like that.  Plenty of legroom, as i'm 6'1" and have no problems driving.  The ride is stiff but i mean its a jeep, you should be used to a tough suspension and some road noise.  If not get a lexus which will cost you oh bout 10x as much.

Offroading:
There is nothing that my jeep can't tackle.  You just throw it in four wheel high and go.  No problems in mud, clay, dirt anything.  Goes strong.  You can shift right into 4 high while going so you don't have to stop and risk getting bogged down.  Make sure you get mud guards if u go with friends as you will cover them.  Also make sure that your friends have wranglers as i have lose many of them when they go and get stuck.  Haha, carry a winch or chains for those who got nothing to bring.

The jeep overall is such a great car and i can't imagine why someone wouldn't want if for a summer vehicle.  

Mine is forsale in the Raleigh NC area if anyone would like it as i am dying paying for gas in it, i'm selling it for 6 thousand.  If interested give me a call at 906-2942.
