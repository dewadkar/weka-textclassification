            As this is my first digital camera, I spent considerable time reviewing digital cameras from many manufacturers.  When it came down to the final choice, all of the industry press on the DSC-V1 made it appear to be a clear leader.  I purchased it, 2 extra batteries, and a 512MB Memory Stick as I was leaving for Hong Kong.

Here is my review of actual shooting conditions of the camera as I tested it in real-life conditions:

Indoor shooting, bright light -- Great color, great clarity, and accurate pictures.  As good as film.

Indoor shooting, medium light -- Took shots at my son's program at school in the auditorium.  Shots were a bit grainy, and the flash didn't handle the distance (50') well.  Didn't use an external flash, however.

Indoor shooting, low light -- Took shots at a Halloween party and the subjects were nearly over-lit and the background was a bit dark, there just wasn't enough fill in the flash.

Overall Indoor thoughts -- If the shooting is close and has some existing lighting, it seems to handle it just fine.  If it's a low-light condition, I'd strongly recommend another flash.  If you use the built-in flash, expect painfully slow recharge times for the flash, especially if the LCD is being used.  The flash issue was the one issue that really holds me back from enjoying this camera more.  I'm strongly considering an external flash to help with this.

Outdoor shooting, daytime -- Took various outdoor shots over a period of 4 weeks in many diffeent lighting conditions.  I have to say that the camera shines when there is good light.  Colors are fantastic, resolution is amazing at 5MP, and flexibility is fantastic.

Outdoor shooting, dusk -- Tried to take some lower-light shots, hoping the near-800 ASA film equivalent would work as I'd hoped.  Again, was a bit disappointed here.  

Low light shots -- This varied.  If it was up-close, it worked great.  If it was at a distance, it just didn't work that well.  Plus, don't know that I see a bunch of benefit to having "green" shots.

Movies -- Overall, I would say that the camera did VERY well in movie mode.  My only issue is that you cannot zoom in or out when the movie is being taken.

When taken in whole, I think that the camera is a great overall camera, but only if you can live with the low-light and flash issues.  If you plan around this, then I think you'll be very happy with this camera.
