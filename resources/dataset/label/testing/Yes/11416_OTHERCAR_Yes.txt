            I think that the title should sum it all up for the 4Runner SR5.  I drives as well as any car, the engine and cabin noise are similar to what anyone would experience in a Honda Accord.  With the storage space in the rear and the 4 wheel capabilities you can go just about anywhere and bring things along.

While the 4Runner maybe considered expensive by some once you get a fully packaged vehicle, it might be worth it to some people.  But you must think do you really need all that options?  Personally, I got a nice SR5 with much of the options I had wanted with the addition of chrome, moonroof, ac,and fog-lights for about $31K (which includes tax and licensing fees).  One particular thing I did not like about the vehicle, it does not have a V8 engine option the SR5 and Limited comes with a V6 and the base model comes with a 4 cylinder.  While it does fine with a V6, I think that you can never have too much power under the engine if you are towing a trailer.

This vehicle is perfect for a person who likes to ride higher than most vehicles out on the road.  This would be a nice move/transition from those who are used to driving a minivan.  This would also be great for those who go to the mountains, whether it is the snow season or not.<br><br>
