            I recently purchased this camera (my first digital camera) and I have been very impressed so far.  The camera itself looks great.  The stainless steel frame is very sturdy.  After you have held this camera, all others will seem like cheap plastic toys.  I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera, and I have not been disappointed.

The controls are easy to use.  The flash is great.  It can take clear close-range photos in pitch darkness!  Most menus are on-screen, so the camera isn't cluttered with lots of buttons.

A great feature is that the camera knows if you are taking the picture horizontally or vertically.  It automatically puts the picture right-side-up so you don't have to rotate the pictures after downloading them to the computer.  This is very nice!

I have not fully explored the software yet, but it is easy to use.  Downloading the pictures to the camera is a breeze.  Just plug the camera into the USB port, turn it on, and the software kicks in!  Anyone can do this!

The best thing about this camera is its size.  It easily fits into a jacket pocket, so you will want to carry it everywhere!  The 16MB memory card that comes with the camera still holds a lot of pictures if you shoot at a smaller size with normal quality.  I am going to buy an additional card.  I would recommend buying these online because the prices are better.  Go to www.pricewatch.com and check it out.

Oh, I almost forgot.  The battery is great.  It lasts a long time.  Charging it is extremely easy.  The charger is very small and plugs right into the wall, so there are no cords to mess with.  It couldn't be any easier!
