            What's so wonderful about a Jeep Grand Cherokee?

This SUV is very comfortable and rides smooth for a sport utility vehicle. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is priced reasonable compared to some of its competitors and of course, it looks grand!  This SUV is rated above many of the other SUV's in dependability, durability and comfort.

Where are the best price SUV's in California?

My experience with researching and finding the best prices for the Jeep Grand Cherokees in California was in the Los Angeles area.  A person could research the area by phoning various dealers and asking about in sale prices.  Better yet, one could also ask the dealers about any vehicles they may have for sale that was a &quot;dealer demo,&quot; as they term it.  This was the way I purchased my vehicle at very low price and with very low miles.  It was like purchasing a brand new vehicle (only 2,000 miles) with a used price tag!

Where are the best places to drive your SUV?

I have taken my SUV all over California and Nevada, and it drives like a charm in any terrain.  Of course, with most SUV's, off road is their specialty terrain and that is always recommended.  It is always recommended to take the SUV out and enjoy it on any road and almost any road condition (i.e., snow, wet, dry, etc,..)
