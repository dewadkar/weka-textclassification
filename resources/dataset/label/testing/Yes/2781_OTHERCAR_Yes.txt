            We purchased the Olympus D-340R digital camera several months ago. Our decision to purchase a digital camera was based on the desire to take photos of items my husband wanted to place to sell at auction sites on the internet. We have a scanner but taking traditional photographs, getting them processed, then scanning them just took too much time. The macro feature is very nice to have as we can get good, tight close up shots with lots of detail. This is important when selling small items on line.

This camera takes very good, clear pictures. There are three different settings using better resolution at each one. Depending on the resolution we chose we can get over 100 pictures to a disk at the lowest resolution. 

The camera is simple to use and has an instruction booklet that is easy to understand. It has a built-in flash and redeye reduction. There are settings for close-up shots, multiple exposures, and there is a setting with a zoom. While not a real powerful zoom, it does have the ability to allow us to take nice candid photos from across a room. 

This camera is also useful for taking pictures of family, friends, vacations, and in our case, our three little dogs, to share with our friends on the internet! 

I'd recommend the camera to anyone. We've had fun using it, we can erase pictures that turn out to be &quot;duds&quot;, blurry shots, or just not what we had in mind, and take another picture in its place! It's reasonably priced and a good value. The only drawback to the camera is that it drains its batteries very quickly, and requires 4 AA batteries. We tried to purchase an AC adapter from Olympus but were told they don't have them available to purchase separately. <br><br>
