            Toyota never stops turning out these high-quality SUVs.  In fact, it seems that it stays way on top of the competitors.  Once again, Toyota knows how to market to this upwardly mobile niche consumers who may need more space due to recent additons to the family membership.  Just a look at the <b>2002 Toyota Land Cruiser</b> will give you an idea of what the Toyota engineers and designers had in mind.  This brand has come to be synonymous with lots of elegance, class and respect on the roads.  After all, those are some of the things that most SUV owners are looking for.  There is no doubt that Toyota has a few legs up on competitors such as Dodge Durango, , 2002 GMC Envoy, 2002 Isuzu Axiom etc.  Which one of these companies can get into the imagination of the consumers to cause them to want to invest so much money in a vehicle?  Toyota has done it with many of their brands.  

I may want to reveal that I have been a fan of the Land Cruiser ever since I was a little boy.  When it first came out, only those with lots of money and a taste for exotic things jumped to purchase one of them.  At the time, Japanese cars were getting popular in the country.  My father could not afford one.  So I had to resort to traveling on his company's Land Cruiser.  I have been in love with the Land Cruisers since then.  You will understand that I am talking about the early models.  So much attention and work have been put into this brand to make it what it is today.  You can imagine why I made time to go test-driving the 2002 Toyota Land Cruiser a few weeks ago.  

<b>What I have found out about this SUV</b>

First things first, it's a truck with lots of presence.  I guess the first thing that caught my attention as I approached was its sheer size.  The devil of an SUV can sit <i>8 passengers</i> without any problems.  And you will still find enough space to place your luggage.  Being a tall man, I did not have to worry about legroom.  I could even jump up from my driver's seat.  And the passengers behind me have enough legroom to be comfortable too.  It's true that I had to push my seat back a bit, but that was not a cause of alarm for my passengers.  I had great visibility as I drove around the town.  The instrument panel truly has enough to keep your mind busy.  Everything is well situated.  No need to  try to find out what the many functions were.  Obviously, As soon as I felt comfortable enough, I managed to play a bit with the air conditioning.  Great air ducts!  In addition, the lighting of the SUV is superb.  More than that, you will find the radio and speaker system.  Depending on what you want, you can have a lot of amenities installed in the truck .  It's all according to your own taste.

<b>4.7 L, 8 cylinders 2002 Toyota Land Cruiser Is King Of The Road!</b>

Whether you can afford a Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, Toyota 4 Runner, Toyota Avalon, Toyota Celica, Toyota RAV4, Toyota Prius or Toyota Echo, you know there is one common point in all these vehicles.  You will get a great value for your money.  The Toyota people know that too.  That's why they provide you with all of types of trucks/SUVs to choose from.  It all depends on the needs of your family.  For 2002, they are offering the Camry, Corolla, 4Runner, Avalon, Celica and MR2 Spyder.  All you need to get your pick.

Obviously, with a V8 engine, the Land Cruiser can be a gas guzzler.  It may not be the ideal work you need.  No matter what you say, it is <b>The</b> car for great occasions such as dinner parties, rectitals, weddings, funerals etc.  You want to strike the pose.  It's not your fault if you are seen on one of them.

I had a great ride in this SUV.  It's very comfortable and easy to maneuver.

I would highly recommend it to anybody who wants something extraordinary.  So far, it's my #1 SUV.
