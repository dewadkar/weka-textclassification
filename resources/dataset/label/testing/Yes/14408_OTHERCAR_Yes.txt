            Three and a half years ago my Dad purchased the ugliest truck I had ever seen. It was white (with chipping paint) with a pink cap and rainbow colored splash stickers down the side of it. Never had I seen such a ugly truck. He owned it for about a year and then I bought it from him. 

I knew it was an ugly truck, but my Dad has been a mechanic for 25 years and he said it was reliable. I purchased it from my dad for $2,000. It had 143,000 miles on it. It was 4 wheel drive and had a manual transmission. I had never driven a manual, so he taught me. It drove so nicely, once I learned not to grind the gears.

I drove this truck about 60 to 100 miles a day. Sometimes more sometimes less. I lived out in the country and I was 18, so going into town and partying with friends was a must. Amazingly enough the truck got wonderful gas millage. About 25 miles to the gallon. It had a six cylinder engine in it.

This truck NEVER left me stranded anywhere. It broke down on me once in the two years that I owned it. And it was just a tie-rod that broke. My dad said that it was normal since the truck was so old. It only cost me $14 dollars to fix it.

When I moved to Arizona to go to college, I had to leave my truck behind. I really didn't want to. It sat in my parents year through the winter. It sat for 6 months. When I came home for the summer, the first thing I did was start it up. He started right up and ran beautifully.

I made the decision to sell it. It had 212,000 miles on it, so I didn't think anyone would buy it. I put an add in the newspaper and two days later I got a phone call. This man wanted to give me $1,700 for my truck. He never drove it and he told me he would buy it.

I drove it out to his house and he paid me for it. Then he drove it and was very please with his purchased. I sold this truck for $300 less then I paid for it and it had 212,000 MILES ON IT!!!!! This man that bought my truck was also a mechanic and when I asked him why he bought the truck without driving it, he told me it was a DODGE and he knew it would run for much longer.

Even though the paint was peeling and it was an ugly truck, it was the most realiable vehicle I ever owned. I can't wait to purchase another one. Dodge vehicles are very dependable. My parents 1986 dodge van had 365,000 miles on it before the transmission went. If you are looking into purchasing a used truck, Go for a Dodge. They are the best out there.<br><br>
