*************************Update March 2003

With only 3,700 miles on the odometer the car remains flawless.  No noises, rattles, etc.  I see many more Highlanders on the roads.

I found out that 4WD means nothing in 2 feet of snow, stranding it for 2 days at the bottom of my driveway.

(+) The rear spoiler (which I don't have) really gives the car a more aerodynamic appearance.

(+) Cargo nets ROCK - the more the merrier!

(-) Brakes, in my opinion, still seem to require more effort than I am used to, though the Toyota dealer thinks otherwise.  He said to check them again at the 5,000-7,000 mile range, as there may be some break-in required.

(-) I REALLY dislike the cloth interior!  The material acts like a lint/hair magnet, so I am constantly using a lint brush.

*************************

I purchased the car in November 2002 at invoice price. I wanted a vehicle with 4WD, car-like agility, great reliability, and something that scored really well in crash tests (it did) for under $30,000. This model really fit the bill.

Now that the initial 1,000 mile "break-in" period is over, I've really been able to zip around and test the vehicle's limits. Here are my findings:

STYLING
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think the exterior is benign - my wife continually confuses Highlanders with Jeep Grand Cherokees and Mazda Tributes. Models with the rear spoiler and running boards look more sleek and do stand out.

DRIVE
The car (or SUV, whatever) drives superbly with ample power from the V6. Very car-like with little or no SUV/Truck rock and sway. It tore through three snowstorms with no problems. Don't get too confident though: From stop to go it's great, but from go to stop remember that anti-lock brakes are pretty useless in snow and ice. I saw too many SUV accidents on the road.

INTERIOR
One word - utilitarian. No luxury, at least in non-Limited models. BUT... Lotsa front and rear room - isn't that what ya want? My 3 year old son can easily maneuver around the back seat and jump into and out of his car seat. Other vehicles like the 2002 Pathfinder and 2002 4Runner have less front and rear room but a bit more trunk space - they feel "tight" on the inside, yet are quite large on the outside (Read Consumer Reports review). Duh! Also notable are the cloth seats - YUK! They look and feel cheap, and you will be reminded of this when showing-off your car to friends.

CONTROLS
Simple and well thought-out! Air conditioning knobs are big and intuitive, and I prefer them. Other SUV's I've driven had lotsa cool-looking buttons, displays, gizmos, etc. (Ford Explorer had a gas/brake lever height adjustment control!) But over time they are more likely to malfunction. The stereo player has big, easy to find buttons and a BIG green display. Speedometer is easy to read. Power driver's seat is a plus - but how about one for the passenger?

STORAGE
Center console seems a little awkward and takes some getting used to. It's rounded, so things fall off. Cupholder device is handy if you (like me) drink GIANT coffees in the morning; otherwise it takes up the valuable and limited space to hold "stuff". There's lotsa room underneath the console, but it's difficult to access and out of sight. Cargo nets are useful - so buy them.

Here are some more observations:

(+) Heat works very quickly

(-) Brakes seem a little weak - will have dealer look at them

(-) Radio has "bas" (low) and "tre" (high) settings, but the "mid" (midrange) setting is only available after pushing and holding the right knob for about 10 seconds

(-) Wheel-well areas look empty, as if the tires are too small - a nice fender trim would probably help

All in all, this is a real winner! Tip - NEVER pay MSRP for a Highlander, as there are many of them on dealer lots.

My only regret - I am now having second thoughts about leasing it - probably should'a bought it!
