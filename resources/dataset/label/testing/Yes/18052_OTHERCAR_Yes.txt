            I bought this car because I wanted a fun drive to work, and the car delivers.  Mind you, I've owned a '68 corvette roadster, two 5.0L Mustang convertibles so I'm familiar with &quot;fun.&quot;  The best part of this car is its design, performance and general workmanship.  The worst part of this car are the small things: poor quality removable floor mats, ugly safety decal on the sun visor, and odd placement of the latch for the center console.

Driving this car adds more excitement/mile because you sit close to the ground.  Be careful!  Your vision is restricted because of this.  Make it a point to give the vehicle in front of you plenty of distance.  It's paid off three times as those vehicle ran over objects in the road...and I was far enough back to maneuver to avoid successfully.  The top flips down quickly; the sound system (Bose) is excellent...and LOUD, if you want it.
   
Road handling is sharp and precise...and it had better be, since Mazda has had more than a decade to figure it out.  And they did.  This is only a four cylinder car...so it doesn't even compare in acceleration to the others I owned, but it's an absolute rocket on mountain roads because it's so low to the ground and well-balanced (doesn't sway away from the turn.)

The trunk fits a standard-sized golf bag...but I gotta take out my driver and lay it diagonally.  Once stuffed 10 twelve-packs of Diet Pepsi and six small bags of groceries in the trunk and somehow made them all fit, so the trunk isn't as useless as it looks.  You'll never pick up anyone (and their luggage) from the airport again, tho.  And that could be a good thing.

The convertible top has a glass rather than plastic window which is good because plastic turns yellow with age.  The engine develops a harmonic buzz (it's a manifold thing, according to the Mazda discussion group.  Apparently, a heat shield &quot;buzzes&quot; as it lays against the manifold at about 4,000 RPM, then disappears at 4,500 RPM)  That's the way it is.  Some people get this corrected and fight with Mazda about it.  Others (like me) aren't so anal and let it slide.  Compared to my Rattle Queen (the '68 Corvette roadster), this car is perfect.
