<TEXT>
            I have an older Chevy Cavalier, a 1991, with 87,000 miles on it.  I was fortunate enough to get all the maintenance records along with the car when it had about 42,000 miles.  I bought it because it was immaculate inside and out, was one owner, and the price was right.

So far it's been great!  I do keep up with maintenance, routine oil changes, lube jobs etc.  It still hasn't required a tune up, nor any major work.  It performs well in the mountainous area I live in, even though it's a 4 cylinder wonder.  Plenty of get up and go, stops well, no alignment problems.

I'd recommend this car to anyone who needs dependability coupled with a little bit of spunk.  It's a cute car for a 4-door, hold 4 comfortable or five with just a little less room, handles well in snow and ice, and gets good gas mileage.<br><br>
