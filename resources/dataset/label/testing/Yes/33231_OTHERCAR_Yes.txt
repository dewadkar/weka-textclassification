            I currently own a 1997 Honda Accord.  I bought this vehicle because I wanted a sedan that was a mid-priced car without being difficult to maintain.  The actual reason I bought it was because the new model years had just come out and the finance rate was really low so I got a really good deal.  I have to say that I am really glad I made the decision.  I got the Limited Edition so it came with power steering, sun roof, CD player and spoiler.  All of these things would have added at least 2,500 to the Accord, so I felt I got good value for money.

I haven't had any problems with this vehicle and find it really reliable.  The warranty is 60,000 or three years which is good but isn't great.  I really enjoy the smooth ride and the comfort of a sedan that has a sporty feel to it.  The only thing that I don't like about the Accord is that I think it could handle better.  Turns can be quite wide sometimes...Honda recommends a lot of maintenance which I don't think is necessary, for example a tune up and tire rotation after 12,000 kilometers.

Driving the Accord is like not driving at all.  The ride is smooth and enjoyable.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I also test drove the Integra, Civic, Maxima, Altima.  I found the Accord to be the best priced with the most features.<br><br>
