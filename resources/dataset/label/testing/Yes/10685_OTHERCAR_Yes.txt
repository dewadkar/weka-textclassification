            If you think $20,000+ for a used car is no bargain, think again.  For between $18,000 - $25,000 you can drive a premier luxury car that looks nearly identical to the new $42,000+ car (especially inside) and carries a warranty like a new car.  I didn't start out looking for an Acura 3.5 RL, I thought I wanted a Lexus. But my wife wanted front wheel drive and seven different test drives of the ES 300 Lexus convinced me to consider an alternative.

AN RL AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A BABY LEXUS?  You bet!  Price a '96-'98 ES 300 and pay about the same price for a used RL.  Last year I bought an immaculate, one owner '96 RL with 36,000 miles for only $21,500.  More room (actually about identical wheel base as the LS 400), more luxury, better ride (much, much better), better everything than the ES.  Indeed, this is a car in the class with the LS 400 and E 320 Benz.  It has all the lux tricks (memory seats/mirrors AND steering wheel, rear heat/air, etc.)

It is roomier than the 5 series BMW or the E 320, especially in back because there is no drive shaft hump running through the middle of the car.  I shopped long and hard and drove many cars (including the new TL) before trying the RL.  You won't find many - including the big German iron - that ride better.  No it doesn't have that tight (often bumpy) European ride.  I have a Porsche for that.  I wanted a smooth, quiet, comfy seat (there's not a chair in my home this comfortable) ride.  I also needed front wheel drive - traction control on rear drive cars is not as good for most drivers.  

Finally, for about $850-$1000 you can add an Acura extended warranty to 100,000 miles, bumper-to-bumper, no deductions.  That's 74,000 miles of warranty (for my car).  Its like all the peace of mind of a new car at 1/2 price.  AND when you pull into the Acura dealer, they treat you like an Acura customer - GREAT.  Don't pay $20k for any used luxury car before you drive this one!
