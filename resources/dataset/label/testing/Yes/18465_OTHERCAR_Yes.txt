            I traded in my old minature mazda pickup- needed something that would haul a load as I am in construction business.
WOW! do I ever have the room now and I didn't take too bad a hit on the gas milage either--from 19 mpg in the 4x4 mazda-city and country-- to 19 mpg in chevy on the highway down to around 13 city.  The overdrive when you get to use it makes a big difference.  My chevy has 4WD, extended cab, long bed and the 350 V-8 with automatic trans.  It handles off road conditions with ease--once pulled a van though a half mile of loose dirt so deep I was pushing it with the front bumper. On the highway it handles better than most cars and is very comfortable.  Have driven it on 3 different trips of over 3000 miles! Cruises at 75 easily and the road noise isn't bad--I run a highway type tread- suspect a off-road tread would make lots of noise.

The only drawback is you just don't turn very sharp so it can be a problem manuvering in tight places. The rear seat is as roomy as most midsized cars-- and folded up makes a dandy storage spot for my tools.

I bought this truck used when it had 70,000 miles on it-- now have 110,000 and the only thing I have had to do besides regular maintance is get the radiator fixed.
Chevy makes a darn good truck!
