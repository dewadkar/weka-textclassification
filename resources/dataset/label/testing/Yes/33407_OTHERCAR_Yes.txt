            I purchased a New 2000 Jetta at the end of August.
On the 20th of October I was involved in minor collision where
I ran into the back of an SUV. 
There was damage to the front of the car - but nothing major. 

The insurance company estimate said repair would take 5 Days, 
so I figured no more than a week or so and I would have the car back.

It ended up taking over 2 months...
The body shop blames VW North America.
I attempted dealing directly with VW Customer Service but it took me ten days and
three phone calls before I was even able to talk to a live person. They can't seem to keep track of their spare parts inventory in this country. This is absolutely unacceptable for a such a popular car that is touted as practical, fun, and affordable.

This should be part of the purchase decision when people decide what car to buy - I never imagined this could happen in 1999 to a German car company that has improved it's image drastically in the past few years.
The marketing department is many steps ahead of the parts dept.

The Jetta is a great car - just read the epinions on it... but I thought that prospective buyers should be aware of this element of Volkswagen.

FINALLY PICKED UP THE CAR ON DECEMBER 20 1999 - without a grille (which is still on &quot;National Backorder&quot;)

A full 2 Months after giving the car to the 
dealership for a 5 day job.
The manager of the body shop reports that something
has gone drastically wrong with the 
Audi/VW parts network and he 
has many cars that have been waiting months for parts. 
You have been warned.

Grill Received - Problem Resolved Finally - (Jan 2000)<br><br>
