            This was the first Envoy that we have bought. We bought this new in Dec '02.  We are extremely happy with it.  We have since added another child so we just bought a '04 Envoy XL which seats 7.  The standard length Envoy seats 5.  We bought the SLE 4x4.  We have had no problems with it and highly recommend it.

We owned 2 GMC Jimmy's prior to buying this Envoy.  The Envoy is so much better than the Jimmy.  The Envoy is  quite a bit bigger than the Jimmy which is good.  The Envoy is very quiet and rides extremely well.  There is plenty of room inside.  The front bucket seats are very wide and comfortable.  This truck is very nice to travel in.  My wife drove this truck until we got the new one and was very comfortable driving it. It has a very tight turning radius. 

The standard inline-6 engine has 275 horsepower and is very smooth and quite with plenty of power. The four wheel drive works great and is simple to use. It has the options of 2 wheel drive, full time 4 wheel drive, automatic 4 wheel drive, and 4 low all with a switch on the dash. The standard 17" wheels are great in snow. 

There are 2 trim levels available (SLE & SLT). There are also many option available. 

The standard SLE comes with many standard options including: 

Power windows 
Power locks with remote 
Dual zone air conditioning 
Rear seat ventilation controls
AM/FM/CD 
Rear wiper 
Dual front airbags 
4 wheel ABS 
Fog lamps 
Child locks 
Window lock out 
2" Trailer hitch receiver 
60/40 split folding second row seat

I only added the rear window defogger.  There are many other great options available (just about anything you would want).  I have added a few items to it since buying it including the luggage rack cross bars, rear cargo mat to keep the cargo area carpet clean and the cargo shade.  You can usually find these on Ebay without paying the high dealer prices.

We love this truck and there is actually nothing that has disappointed us with it so far. We highly recommend it!
