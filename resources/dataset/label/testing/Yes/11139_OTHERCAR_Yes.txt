              My experience with my second Hyundai Scoupe was a pleasure, I sold the car because it was reaching 80K. After 100K, Hyundai's tend to loss their value, so it was a good idea selling it right away and hopefully get back a few thousands instead of hundreds.

  At the time, I was looking for a Ford Probe or a Mazda MX6, I had to think twice before buying another Hyundai Scoupe again, but the mileage and the price was something that I could not turn away. In November of 98 I paid $2700 for a 95 with 48.000 miles that was a good deal because at the time the same car with the same miles could cost something close to $4000 so I bought it.

  This time I bought the loaded model with power windows, sunroof, spoiler, automatic transmission with overdrive, everything but the turbo.  Then I put a viper alarm and a nice  stereo, the car was loaded.  I drove 30.000 miles in a little more than a year, long trips, short trips, city, just everywhere, the car behave good at all times, I never had any engine problems, neither suspension, nothing, just fill up the tank and go.

 
  The car was fast for a little engine, good on gas, the seats were pretty comfortable in the front, excellent turning ratio, good handling in high speed turns,  my top speed was 110, that is not bad for a small car, the A.C did not give me any problems, (I live in Florida) and the paint did not fade or crack. I think the factory wheels where even nicer that the ones you see in more expensive cars.

  One of the few drawbacks was that at high speeds the air made a funny noise in the side windows, sounded like it was not sealed enough, however  I did not have any leaks. The space in the rear seats was small but decent for it's category, plenty of head and leg room in the front and everything in the dashboard was easy to read and operate.

  It is too bad that a lot of people judge the car just for the brand, some people say bad things about Hyundai just because the have heard it from someone else, the vehicle does not have the best reputation in the market but based on my personal experience I would buy another Hyundai, of course, after somebody else paid for it's depreciation.
