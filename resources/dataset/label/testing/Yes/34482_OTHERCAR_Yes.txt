            I've owned my Leganza since 1997.  
Mine is a Korean market spec.  Black, ABS, 5 speed.


This is a good car.  
Suspension was developed by Lotus and the handling displays the Lotus engineering.  The body roll is well controlled and high speed ride is quite good. Car displays mild understeer and gives no surprises.  Handling is quite European, although it's sprung more for comfort than control. 

The NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) suppression is good. And from what I understand safety is above average (4 driver and 5 passenger stars in U.S. NCAP crash tests).

The engine isn't as smooth as a Japanese motor, but it growls nicely when you take it up above 3500 RPM's.  Mind you this is a passenger car motor.


In summa: a good value, well built &quot;European&quot; sedan.
