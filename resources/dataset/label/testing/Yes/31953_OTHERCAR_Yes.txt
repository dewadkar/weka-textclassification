            We made a deal with my daughter when she was small that however much money she had when she was old enough for a car, we would match.  Obviously, we thought she would want a new car, NOT!  Her vision of the perfect car was a 1973 VW &quot;Hippy Bus&quot;.  We tried to discourage her, but to no avail!  My husband and I are FORD people and we knew nothing about this foreign &quot;dinosaur&quot;.

We looked for over 6 months before we found one and then we found one in a million pieces, but my daughter insisted that this would be a &quot;good family project&quot; and she would use her money to refurbish this old, heavy, cheaper vehicle instead of having a new vehicle that she claims she doesn't feel safe in &quot;small tin can&quot;.

We have totally rebuilt this vehicle with the help of many books, online help from many helpful people and websites and GOD bless J. C. Whitney!  The vehicle is well thought out and actually is smartly engineered and definitely made to last!  It is good on gas, cheap on taxes and insurance and it's back in style!  What a deal!

I recommend this vehicle, which I trust my daughter's wellbeing to, to anyone looking for a good, reliable used vehicle. It's built like a tank and even though it does not have airbags, my daughter feels safe in it.  It's easy to maintain and even &quot;idiots&quot; can keep it running!  Just buy a good book and picture by picture, you could build one from scratch!  You do not have to be a mechanical person to keep this vehicle on the road!  You will save alot in mechanic bills, if you dare to do it yourself!  Happy Volkswagoning!<br><br>
