            I am very happy with my Envoy XL SLT. The SLT model comes with tons of standard features, the ride is smooth and quite, exactly what you would expect from an upscale vehicle but it's suspension is a little spongy. I am also very happy with the cargo capacity and the room available behind the third row, but the fact that the third row seats doesn't fold flat is a bit inconvenient. Additionally, being that this is a very large vehicle, I would have expected more in the way of storage compartments. Having opted for the DVD player, I have no place to store the wireless headphones. If GM had put forth a little more ingenuity, I am sure they could have found some spots to places additional storage compartments. Aside from those minor details, the Envoy XL is a well equipped and luxurious for an SUV. 

Competition is tough in 7+ passenger mid-size SUV field but the Envoy XL is definitely tops in its category. The Envoy XL certainly has several advantages over its competition such as cargo capacity and power. But, just like any other vehicle, Envoy XL it is not perfect. For example, there are some features found in other SUV's not found in the Envoy XL. Features such as the Navigational System found in the Acura MDX and the soon to be released Honda Pilot, adjustable foot pedals and back up sensors found in the Ford Explorer, and finally, flat folding third row seats. So, if you are looking for a mid-size SUV with all these features, good luck because you will never find one. Taking everything into consideration, I shopped around long and carefully and ultimately my decision came down to the Envoy XL.
