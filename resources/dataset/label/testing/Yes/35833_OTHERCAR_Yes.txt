            My husband and I bought a used 1993 Saturn SL2 in 1997.  To date (4+ years), we have had about 1500 dollars in repairs.  Not bad for a relatively inexpensive used car!

Before buying, we looked at lots of cars:  Hondas, Toyotas, Fords, all in the same approximate price range.  For what we could best afford, Saturn gave us the biggest bang for the buck:  better ride than the Fords, better reliability, and also much safer with the steel frame.  (We've since tested the steel frame in a nasty side collision and it definitely works!)  

We decided that the Saturn was better than an older Honda or Toyota for a number of reasons.  First of all, for what we could afford (we were both graduate students at the time), we wanted a car with less mileage (more likely to last until we finished school and had jobs, also less costly in terms of upkeep).  Also, my sister had a Saturn that had been extremely reliable for her, we liked the good gas mileage (25 to 35 mpg), and not unimportantly, we liked the Saturn philosophy (low pressure sales, known for high quality despite the relatively low cost, good review on their used cars).  We even got a car history, since the people who had owned it had dealt nearly exclusively with the Saturn dealership from the time THEY had purchased it.

We thought we were buying reliability within a relatively nice, clean, and comfortable car, and we did.  It's been dependable and has held up well.  It still looks very good on the outside, despite the fact that it had 3 years in the Los Angeles sun (love those plastic panels!) and is nice on the inside, too.

The downsides:  it's not comfortable for really long periods of time if you are a tall person or have long legs.  I don't like the way the driver's side seat is shaped and don't find the lumbar support to actually help in any substantive way.

When sitting in the middle, my 2 year old can rest his feet on the seat in front of him quite easily (annoying when I want to rest my arm close to the center and I'm not sure how safe that is if we were to stop suddenly).  

It is not a quiet car.  Few rattles, etc., but LOTS of road noise, which also gets annoying after a few hours.

The storage space is limited:  now that we have a child, we find that our trunk is nearly gone!  The backseat is small:  with two car seats, there will be hardly any room in the car.

But we are still thinking about a Saturn for our next car (maybe the new Saturn SUV or station wagon) because it has been so reliable and easy to maintain.  This is a good car.
