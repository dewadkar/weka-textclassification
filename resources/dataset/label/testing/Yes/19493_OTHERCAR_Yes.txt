            Having the Casio QV-3000 for over 8 months now, I can say with confidence, that it has been well worth the money. At the time, the camera was the first to sport a 3.3 Mega Pixel resolution. Taking pictures at a standard of 2048x1536 resolution, I would never have to worry about my pictures being to small for printing. Easy automatic features or complex, fine tuning controls let me take the perfect pictures. This camera can do it all with no turning back. 

One of the main reasons I bought this camera, was the storage medium included with the camera. The Plus edition comes with a whopping 340MB IBM Microdrive. I can take around 250 pictures at 2048x1536 without having to download to the computer. Second, I can use that same Microdrive in my Cassiopeia Pocket PC, without reformatting it. Third, I have the option later to get up to a 1GB Microdrive. I knew that I would never run out of storage on my cam, and that was a huge weight off my shoulders!

The Casio QV-3000 take four AA batteries. I use two sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries and rotate them. Needless to say, I never run out power or storage in one shoot.

Casio QV-3000 equals options galore. The ability to take quick, beautiful, snap shots is perfect for when out being a tourist. However, the ability to set the shutter speed and aperture is essential when shooting portrait or other project images. The camera also has a 3x optical zoom and a 6x digital zoom. The optical zoom is nice, but when using the 6x digital zoom, it cuts the resolution in half. Therefore, it is pointless, and I don't recommend using it. Focusing is of major importance to any photographer. The Casio QV-3000 covers them all: manual, infinity, and a macro settings. Finally, settings like portrait, panorama, night scene, landscape, and movie expands all shooting options. Note: The movie setting allows you to record up to a 30 second mini-movie. However, it does not record sound, and it's almost impossible to find a editor on a computer the supports the format. I never use it like I thought I would have.

The camera comes with a great download agent that works on both PC and Mac via USB and/or Serial cable. However, if you dare to download 300MBs over a Serial cable, you might as well take another weeks vacation in the mean time!

Overall, I love this camera. The picture quality is absolutely fabulous. It is a tad bulky to hold at times, and isn't the lightest thing, but I truly recommend it to anyone. With the Microdrive the Casio QV-3000 retails around $1000. Without the Microdrive it is $800. With such a high resolution of images that it takes, averaging at 1 to 1.5 MB per image, I wouldn't suggest getting it without the Microdrive.
