            I'm a college student so I needed something small and efficient, but still able to adapt to the randomness in my life, this truck dose exactly that.

  I get approximately 28 MPG. so a tank usually runs about 350 miles. It is a very easy to control vehicle, but it is very slow to accelerate.  It has a transmission that feels like it is more geared to towing.

  The only other complaint I have with this vehicle is the placement of the fuel safety cut off switch.  This is a little switch that takes over and cuts the fuel pump off when you get into a wreck.  well it is placed under a wall panel on the passenger side right next to their feet.  So if they accidentally kick it too hard, which happened to me, your fuel pump shuts off.  It's easy to fix if you know what you are doing you just unscrew the panel and reset it with the push of a button.  

  My other gripe about it's design is that they use plastic clips in the locking mechanism.  Which mean that if you try to jimmy the lock you can easy sheer the clip making key access impossible.  Metal would not have cost that much more and would increase the durability of the lock many fold.

   But, it has been a reliable little truck that could squeeze into any space and has usually required no more up keep than changing the oil.
I have never had to have major service to this vehicle, and I have owned it for well over 2 years.
