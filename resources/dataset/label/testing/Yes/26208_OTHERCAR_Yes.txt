            Yup - I said it... &quot;Daily Driver&quot;.  

My daily driver is a 1987 Ferrari 328 GTS Serial #66427 black exterior/tan interior.  It's been my daily driver since February of 1998.  &lt;A HREF= http://www.zing.com/album/?id=4294441915 &gt;Pictures are only a click away.&lt;/a&gt;

So, on with the review.  I think that James Bratek did a nice overall review on the 328 in &lt;A HREF= <a href='/./auto-review-7A7A-A93A8FA-3825EF8C-bd1'>http://www.epinions.com/./auto-review-7A7A-A93A8FA-3825EF8C-bd1</a> &gt;his epinions piece&lt;/a&gt;.

---------------------------
Research and the importance of the Ferrari clubs...

Before you buy your own, I think you should:
1) read James' review it's pretty good on it's own and sites some good references

2) refer to Forza article he mentions - I have the issue - it's pretty good

3) if you can find it - pick up the original Ferrari V8 (ISBN 1-870979-78-8) it'll answer some questions about he v8 family of mid engine Ferraris and has some nice photos

4) again, if you can find it get 'A Collectors Guide: Ferrari Dino 246, 308, and 328' (ISBN 0-947981-23-3) good photos, differentiations between the early models to the late.

5) contact the Ferrari Club of America (FCA) and join it well before you make any purchase.  You'll meet owners and others researching the cars, you'll find out about all the local mechanics (dealer affiliated and independent), you'll make a lot of friends and you'll receive the local region's newsletter with a list of upcoming events and usually some club member's cars go up for sale and are listed in there as well.

I know there are other clubs (Ferrari Owners Club comes to mind) but they seemed to be more of a gold chain crowd than enthusiasts of Enzo's wonderful machines.  Your mileage will vary, and I'm sure it depends on where you are on what the flavor of the local Ferrari club is and it could be the opposite experience for you in your area.

The FCA is a lot more active in my area and I've become an active member of the &lt;A HREF= http://ferrariclub.com &gt;Pacific Northwest Region of the Ferarri Club of America&lt;/a&gt; being a member of the board as the Newsletter Editor for this past year (2000-2001).

6) the Ferrari List is always a good source of info - check out &lt;A HREF= http://ferrarilist.com &gt;http://ferrarilist.com&lt;/a&gt;.  You'll find a lot of noise on there but also a lot of good information, especially from Ric Rainbolt, Doc Fung, Steve Jenkins, and some others.  If you ask a question it will get answered.

---------------------------
The 328:

James did a nice job on the overall 328 background - I'll skip to the specifics of what I like and dislike about my car and my personal experiences.

---------------------------
Things I love:
---------------------------
The looks - the car is the pinnacle of the 3xx series for me.  I don't like the 70s feel of the 308, the strakes of the 348, the overall lines of the 355, or the roundedness of the 360.  The 328 is the car that think most resembles the 3xx Ferrari I've always dreamed about.  I will definitely be purchasing a front engine V-12 mid to late 60s Ferrari in the future... which will fulfill the other half of my Ferrari dreams.

Removable hardtop - nice to remove and listen to the engine in the summer, and it doesn't let any rain get to me in the winter (Seattle doesn't get snow so I drive it year round).

Reliable - I bought my car after it had been idle for a couple of years - it needed a full set of hoses, belts, and some overall TLC.  Once it got the proper attention I've had only one problem.  An oil spill because a replaced hose gave out because it was running too high a pressure.  Since that was fixed, no problems that were the car's fault.  (It was keyed and I had it repainted this year... but the poor car couldn't help that.)  

Affordable - figure two grand per 15000 miles if you're driving daily and you bought a not quite perfect cosmetic car that you're slowly restoring to perfect (my story).  You need to replace belts every 5 years or 30k miles (basically, a full major service that includes a lot of stuff) - it's cheap insurance and will run you $1k to $4k depending on your shop and location and the amount of work you actually needed in addition to the full service.  You could do the work yourself, but you're a braver person than I... there are other out there on the FerrariList that do it and you can get pointers from them.  Don�t skimp on it � if you ever sell it to someone else it is going to be their dream car , for goodness sake do NOT sell them something that has not been properly maintained to the highest standard, please?  Pretty please?  I have the oil changed every 3000 miles and go with plain old Castrol 20-50GT.

Storage space is decent: you can fit a couple duffels in the back and take off for a weekend - very usable and easy to get at luggage space.

It brings me joy every time I crank it up and take it out on the road!

---------------------------
Things I don't like:
---------------------------
The windshield wipers - invest in a lot of rain-x.  the wipers are worthless... I live in Seattle, it rains a lot here so trust me.

Closing the front hood � pre �89 328s have a little button you have to press to release the latch � these little buttons have caused more front hood bends than anything else � you�ll notice a lot of 328s with a bend in the front hood.  Replace it with the non-button version of hood prop that came with the 89s.

Third brake light - My '87 has a third brake light that consumes what feels like 50% of the usable rear window/rearview mirror space.

Distance to steering wheel - In order to fit (I'm 6'1&quot;) I have to lean back and have the seat as far back as possible - so, my arms are outstretched pretty much.

Heaters - they take too long to kick on, but man, once they kick on... THEY ARE ON.  You've got a very small passenger compartment and some heaters that are slow to heat but nuclear powered once on.

Front radiator placement - uh... think about this for just a second - I live where it rains all the time.  If it's cold out and the rain is cold... the radiator is hot after driving for a while.... come to a light where you're sitting still or going slow in traffic... the rain falls and evaporates due to the heat of the radiator... you pull forward into a continual self made fog.  :-)

Steering at low speeds - get used to it being heavy.  Period.

Don't pull close to a curb in front - you'll hit the bumper on the curb.  Similarly, don�t pull closely next to a curb and open the door � you�ll hit the door on the curb.

Closing the luggage/engine lid � pull it down and do it sharply � too many times I�ve seen it gently brought down and then someone leans on it to get it to engage�. Bad move � it�s very delicate metal on top of the rear hood.  Don�t lean on it!

Top stores behind the seats � and takes away legroom for me as a tall person.  I lean the seat forward a bit and shove it in behind the seat without too much discomfort though.

2nd gear when it�s cold � it�s a little harder to get into until the gear oil comes up to temp.

---------------------------
Recommended add-ons:
---------------------------
Get a Tubi exhaust - better high end output and it just sounds darn nice with it

If you use the car daily get a decent stereo and replace the speakers.  As much as I love the engine sound (which is LOUD with the Tubi), you still get stuck in traffic.

---------------------------
Summary:
---------------------------
I love the car, it�s been good to me and I hope to NEVER part with it, ever.  You should so your homework before you go and buy one of these cars and you�ll be happier in the long run.  It�s the second highest production run of a Ferrari as James says and you should remember that there are MANY cars on the market and more that will come into the market � never purchase a car that you have questions about that can�t be answered� you�ll sleep better at night.  I've put only about 15000 miles on the car in almost three years, but it gets driven almost daily.

It is a pretty, but not extremely powerful car.  Good overall feel at the track, relatively quick but you're gonna get blown by many others at a Ferrari track event.  Not good off the line but, don't forget, it's not made for that.

REMINDER: Replace the timing belts if you can't confirm 100% sure they haven't been replaced in the past 5 years or 30k miles.  It's cheap insurance and could save you a VERY costly rebuild.  A Ferrari is only as reliable as the owner is diligent about preventive maintenance.
