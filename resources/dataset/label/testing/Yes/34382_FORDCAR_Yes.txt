            In my wildest dreams, I never thought Me!!! Never thought I would ever be driving a station wagon,,,, you know everyone says station wagons are for old people or mothers with 12 kids.  Well, I was wrong!!  My Ford Taurus station wagon is the best investment I ever made.

I purchased it from one of my companies sales reps, it had about 30,000 miles on it and the car kinda grew on me, every morning I'd drive into work and get out and look at the car, thinking to myself, gosh that really isn't a bad looking car.  Kind of sporty looking but really a good size car.  

Well I've owned that car for just over a year now and I have had not one bit of problem with it!!  I actually love it!!  The front of the car took a little getting use to because you can't really see the front, down to the bumper but got use to that in no time!!  The cars ride is quiet and comfortable and the space it just great.  My eight year old thinks the seat in the back is to cool... That seat is a nice touch because if Im off to a soccer game and have 5 kids to bring well the 2 seats in the back that come with seat belts does the trick!!!  Plus when the kids ride in those seats.....You really can't hear them from where your sitting!!!  It's a nice feature!!  When you don't need the seats just fold them down and now its a real staion wagon.

I love my taurus wagon and would recommend it to anyone, gas mileage is about 25 in town and about 33 highway!!! Not bad!!

Like I said I would recommend this car to anyone, I love it and Im only 33 years old!!!!!!  <br><br>
