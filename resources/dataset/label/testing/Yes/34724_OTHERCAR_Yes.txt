            I've recently purchase a black Sebring JXI 2000 with tan interior.  

I'm very pleased that an American manufacturer (yes, I know the car was built in Mexico) can still offer a convertible with classic American room and comfort with sporty performance and handling.   

For those of you who expect the acceleration and perfection of a true sports car or European $$$ convertible, you will be disappointed.  However, my Sebring can fly up the steepest grade out here in Sierra Nevada Mountains or pounce through the curves of Tahoe with ease.   It performs like this while achieving an average of 26 mpg for me.

My JXI has 4-wheel disk brakes and 4-wheel independent suspension, and alloy wheels, items unthinkable in the golden age of convertibles.   I�ve owned older Camaros and even Jags, and I�ll put the total experience and lines of the Sebring over both of those.

The first afternoon I bought the Sebring, I took it up to Virginia City, Nevada, about 23 steep miles straight up from my location.   The car sprinted up and through all the curves with comfort and agility.  All the while, the wonderful �Infinity� sound system was easily enjoyed above the moderate cabin noise.

The car only cost $28,000 new with every luxury, or about $18,000 for my used one (hint).

The car does have considerable road noise from the tires, but I suspect that the Michelins are causing a lot of that.   Also, the brakes do have some sponginess (the manual states not to pump the brakes, which somehow degrades the anti-braking ability).
