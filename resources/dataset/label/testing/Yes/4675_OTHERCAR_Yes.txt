            When I was 17 my mother bought a 1996 two door Cavalier and I loved driving it.  I finally bought my own later that same year, and my sister bought hers the next year.  We have not had a single mechanical problem out of any of our Cavaliers.  
I love the fact that they have a sporty look while the price (of the car itself AND the insurance coverage) is far below that of most sports cars.  It is available in 2 door or a 4 door, so you can pick which one you want according to your needs.  My mother and I both drive 2 doors, but my sister has a young baby so she chose the 4 door.  
The Cavalier is fun, sporty, reliable, and affordable.  This is perfect for someone who is looking to buy their own first car.  I'm a college student and I only make $7.50 an hour at my job and I'm able to afford it with plenty of cash left over.  Best of all, I will never again worry about looking like a loser in my dad's old truck, or whether or not the car is going to get me stranded on the other side of town.  If you're in the market for a new car, you should definitely drive the Cavalier before you make your final decision.<br><br>
