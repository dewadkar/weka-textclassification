            I purchased my 2000 Toyota RAV4 in July 2000 as an upgrade from my Honda Prelude.  I needed more space after purchasing a home the year before.  The RAV4 is the perfect size for my needs, not too massive like a higher level SUV.  The cargo area is the perfect size for making large grocery runs (especially to one of those wholesale stores!).  In addition, when the back seats are down, there's enough space for a trip to the local nursery to stock up on plants, mulch and other gardening supplies.  Finally, I can at now make trips to the park or the beach with my two dogs (which at 115 and 85 pounds resemble small bears).  Needless to say none of this was possible with my previous sportscar.

Driving this vehicle is fun!  It small enough to drive or park anywhere.  It has quite a bit of pickup as I discovered the first day I owned it and received a speeding warning for blasting away from a red light.

Another thing I like about this SUV is the low height of the cargo area relative to the ground.  It is very easy to get things in and out of the car, especially babies in carseats in the back.  We previously owned an Explorer and as a small women, it was sometimes difficult for me to reach into the cargo area, or to lift the baby in and out of the car seat.  I never have this problem with the RAV4.

There are three things I dislike about this SUV. First, because it is smaller than the normal SUV, I have had trouble getting longer items into the SUV.  For example, when remodeling the kitchen, I had to pick up some trim or baseboards from the hardware store.  The 8ft sections barely made it in and to sit between the front seats up to the windshield.  Second, my SUV does not have antilock brakes.  I'm not sure if this is a feature available, but the lack of it does increase the insurance.  Finally, when driving on the highway, the wind noise in the SUV is very loud and distracting.  This was something I did not discover on the test drive.<br><br>
