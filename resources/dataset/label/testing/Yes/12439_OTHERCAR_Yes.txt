            I'm very fond of my Passat 1995 (19 Tdi) I bought in December 1999. It's a very spacious car. All the passengers can be seated comfortably and the space in the trunk is really enormous. The quality of the engine is superb: no disturbing noise and very economical (5-5.5 l/100 km). After 5 months of driving this car, I am still very happy with it and can recommend it to everybody who spends a lot of time on the road: in this car, it never gets tiring. 
Some critical points are the finishing and design of the interior which can be much better for a top model (this was much better in my former car: Ford Escort-European model 1998) and the rattling sounds which can be heard from time to time.<br><br>
