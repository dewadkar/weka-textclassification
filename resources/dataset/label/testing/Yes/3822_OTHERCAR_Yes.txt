            My wife and I previously owned a 1999 CRV 4 WD-EX. We traded it in due to the lack of horsepower & cargo space. My wife missed the SUV for transporting our dog and the space for golf clubs and groceries. So we purchased a Black 2002 Honda CRV-EX 4-WD with all the standard options. 

At first I was hesitant to buy a CRV because of the lack of interior space on my old model, but now I am pretty impressed. The new body style is very spacious, You can carry four to five adults with ample room and still have space for luggage.

The new body-style adds more personality with stronger headlamps and a re-designed rear door where the glass opens seperate from the door itself.

In the interior you can now fold the rear seats all the way up to the front seats to create a good amount of cargo space. You also get two large compartments on the dash to store CD's, your mobile phone and various knick knacks without filling up you glove compartment!

Gas mileage is the same as previous models. We get 22mpg in the city and 26hwy-No sacrifice in MPG with the increase in horsepower.

With the automatic transmission you get enough power to get around town without lagging behind like previous years. I do however wish Honda would get with it and put out a V6 model! 

Honda did a good job making the automatic more attractive on the 2002's. I really enjoy having the gear shift and the Emergency brake right on the dash. It adds to the vehicles personality and is very convenient.

All and all this is a cool little SUV. My wife wanted something reliable that looks good and is not to expensive.

One thing I would recommend is to get the EX model. You get the 6 Disc In-Dash Cd-Changer with Air and Cruise as well as the ever popular floor mats and stylish rims. The EX also has the highest resale value and is rated very well in Consumer Reports.

One warning-Do not get the EX-L model with leather. The leather Honda uses on their SUV's is not of the quality used on their Accords. Its much cheaper and is cracks very easy. Purchase your leather interior aftermarket and save money and get the quality you want!
