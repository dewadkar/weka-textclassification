            When my wife decided it was time for a new vehicle, she had already decided on one of the compact SUV's. Having compared the Honda and Mitsubishi units, she actually fell in love with the Escape.  I was not sold initially, but it was to be her vehicle, so away we went.

We have really enjoyed this vehicle (and the low financing was an added bonus).  The added security of on-demand 4x4 has been a plus, although this minimal winter of ours (Iowa) has allowed for only a little testing.  It does tow our boat with ease, although I'd not consider doing so for extremely long trips.  Mileage is acceptable and climbing as the break-in continues.

One minor drawback is in handling.  This vehicle has neither the road grip of a sedan nor the plush ride of a full size SUV.  It's caught somewhere between, and seems to want to wander a little too much for my taste, but, then again, I don't spend all my windshield time in it.

There seems to be considerable wind noise on the road in the Escape.  I've mentioned it to the dealer, but body panel alignment seems acceptable, so there hasn't been anything that could be done about it.  It's not like driving with the windows open, but then again, it's far from silent, either.

Only problem so far (5 months) has been with the CD player.  While the sound system is great for a factory unit, a short developed in the speaker connections.  It had to be sent back to Ford for repairs, and we went 3 weeks with a gaping hole in the dash.  Apparently, it's such a hot seller, that no replacements were readily available, and it had to be repaired.  Parts took 2 weeks to arrive.

Overall, a decent buy for the money. 

After a year, still no problems other than a rattle in the rear hatch.  Dealer fixed with "rubber tape".  Not ideal, but it's gone, and they will redo if necessary.  Mileage (after 15,000 miles) stands at a decent 21 mpg hwy.  I'm finally used to the handling, other than the accelerator seems pretty touchy, and it's awfully easy to do jackrabbit takeoffs, which peeve my wife.  We're thinking of trading for an even lower APR, and may just get another, but the wife says she will not get the sunroof, as it's senseless.

UPDATE:  11/14/2003!!
After owning this vehicle for almost exactly 2 years (and 31,000 miles) my wife decided it was time to replace it before the 36K warranty ran out.  She actually just bought the 2004 version of the same vehicle - same color and everything.  Only major difference is a step up to custom wheels and tubular running boards.  (New one still has useless moonroof!)

We still experienced no major warranty issues with the 2002.  It was in the shop a total of twice.  Once to get the CD player fixed and again to have an air leak fixed on the hatchback.  This involved an addition of a piece of foam to the catch and problem went away.  

Handling remained the same with the miles, and I'm much more used to the way it works the road.  No complaints anymore, and I'll have to let you know how the '04 works.
