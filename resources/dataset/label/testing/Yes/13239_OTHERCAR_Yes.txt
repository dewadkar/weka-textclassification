            BACKGROUND:

The redesign in 1998 marked the beginning of the Honda Accord's sixth generation, and the first time in it's history that it can truly be called a midsize instead of a compact. The 2004 Accords are now out, the second year for the seventh generation. It seems as America buys these in droves, they have long forgotten the 1998-2002 Accords that are, as I call them, the last of the best... The end of an era, if you will... The era of familiarity.

Okay, so most of you are lost. I understand, please allow me to proceed. I grew up with Honda Accords. The 80's were good years for the Accord and it's arch-rival, the Camry. Though extremely generic, they exhibited a level of quality and sophistication unmatched by their domestic competitors. While I acknowledged this, Honda didn't really have my attention with the boxy, flapping-headlights Accord sedan, coupe, or hatchback. In 1990, that all changed.

The fourth generation was the beginning of that era I mentioned earlier. The interiors beginning then were not only ergonomically perfect, but attractive, as well. Upon sitting in the cockpit of a fourth generation Accord, I immediately felt at home. When I sat in my 1999 Accord EX-L sedan, I felt that same sense of familiarity... of utmost comfort. I drove my mother's 01 Accord EX five-speed coupe, and I felt that then, too. When she traded six months ago for a 2003 EX-V6 coupe and I drove it... That feeling was gone. I'll review that later... Now that you've read my history with Honda, on with my review of the 99 Accord I purchased a month ago.


General Information:

My Accord is nothing special. Your typical run-of-the-mill Accord EX-L sedan. The "L" in the trim-level means that it is equipped with the optional leather interior, but not the V6 engine. Standard equipment is AM/FM CD with six speakers, power windows, mirrors, locks, keyless and lighted entry, auto-off headlights, A/C, ABS, alloy wheels, dual airbags, and tinted windows. Add the leather option and you get a power driver's seat. Mine is equipped with an automatic transmission and has just over 70,000 miles.

So how does it drive and ride?

Do you really love to drive? Love the roar of an engine, power-sliding, hugging curves? If so, the Accord is not for you. It drives and tracks perfectly straight, the steering feel gives better feedback than the Camry but not that of a sports car. Despite it's large dimensions, the Accord drives much like a smaller car. It handles with competence, but doesn't beg to be thrown around. The brakes are strong and linear, and in the event you need to avoid an accident, the ABS can work miracles. You'll find that the ride is firm, but comfortable. You feel irregularities in the pavement just enough to feel connected to the road. Do not expect to float around as if in a Camry. Sixth Generation Accords are equipped with HPV shocks (Honda Progressive Valve), therefore at interstate speeds the ride is very taut. The shocks adjust to the speed of the car and the surface of the road. At slow speeds on bumpy pavement, the suspension will gobble up the bumps. However, at 85MPH down the smooth interstate the suspension becomes firm and that reflects in the cabin. You get used to that characteristic the more time you spend in the car, but if you're looking for a big, luxury car ride you have been warned.   

What's ownership like? The interior?

If you lead a busy life and need a car you don't have to think about, you should consider the Accord. The Accord requires little attention and attracts about the same amount. Oil changes are only needed every 7500 miles(a maintenance required light in the dash flashes to remind you at start-up when you reach 6000 miles since last service) and a tune-up isn't necessary until 105,000. With regular maintenance, the Accord will age gracefully. It is known for reliability and longevity, after all.  
If you can get past the generic outside appearance, you can understand a car is enjoyed from the inside out. If all people thought along those lines, everyone would buy an Accord. The reason for this is, simply put, no one can do an interior quite like Honda. Look around at other reviews and other sites and see what you can find about the Accord's interior. I think you'll see that the Accord has a truly marvelous interior and that's not just my epinion. 
The dashboard layout is clean, for lack of a better word. Large pieces cut down on rattles that can develop as miles accumulate. Instruments are easy to read and well lit. The colors are two-tone jobs, either a charcoal/black or brown/beige combination. My Accord is Emerald Pearl and has the brown/beige combination. The interior is warm and inviting. The leather feels rich and supple, but the comfortable seats come standard with cloth on four-cylinder models. There are strikingly similar styling cues in the 1999 Accord that were in the 1990 Accord, yet more refined and modern. All in all this interior sets the standard for all other vehicles. 

So to put the "con" in Conclusion:

Despite being very close, the Accord is not perfect. The engines, even the V6, lack the low-end grunt of a Nissan V6. Cruise control buttons on the steering wheel are not lighted at night, nor are the window switches. Some people complain about the placement of the moonroof controls, but growing up with Honda, I don't like them anywhere else but on the lower left of the dash. That said, at 70,XXX miles, my Accord is as solid, silent, and trouble free as it was when it was new. When I had the oil changed recently my mechanic told me that from a mechanical standpoint, it was hardly broken in. Perhaps that is why no other car on the road holds its value quite like the Honda Accord. The Altima is faster, the Camry rides better... But for a transportation companion, the Accord is without peer.
