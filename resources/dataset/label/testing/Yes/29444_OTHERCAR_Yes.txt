            The scene is summer 1999, just got out of college, just got married, and we needed a new vehicle. Myself being 23 and my wife 21 our #1 priority was the top needed to come off (of the vehicle!). Period! Our first thought was a 1999 Mustang Convertible, but we live in Rochester, NY so the 4 wheel drive was important as well. Also, a budget was needed. A convertible that was 4 wheel drive would have meant to buy an Audi or some fancy foreign job that doesn't interest me in the least. My wife actually reminded me that the Jeep Wrangler was perfect! I totally forgot, and got brainwashed that these are SOOO impractical! Phhoooeey!!!

What I love about this vehicle. So we went all out (not Sahara because Chili Pepper Red w/ gray interior was not available as a Sahara model color) with the sport package. Fully loaded, the only thing missing is the ABS because of the Dana 44 rear axle. Basically we both love this thing to death! It has fit our mold perfectly as a fun as heck truck to drive around with the top off and to have people look at us, wishing that their top came off whatever they were driving!  We also got the dual top option which is a godsend in the winter time!

What I hate. This could be tough. It truly has met our needs 100% The trunk space in non-existant! Gas Mileage on the Auto Tranny is only about 15MPG, and the Auto tranny being a 3 speed is very quick to take off, but isn't smooth going 65MPH on an expressway, so if you know how to drive standard, get the manual tranny. Also, the truck doesn't weigh enough for good reliable winter driving.

Who should and should buy this vehicle: fun couples with no kids, young people in college or high school, mid-life crisis guys and girls trying to pick up guys and girls! haha

Who shouldn't: anyone with a family. Basically if you're looking for an SUV, then this truck shouldn't be on your list! Only fits two uncomfortably in the back, and the front is tight (being 6'2&quot; it's tight for me).<br><br>
