            Things I Like
Although many people think I'm crazy here in the heart of the snow belt, I bought a 2001 V-6 Mustang as a commuter car -- and it turned out to be a good choice!  After a year of ownership, some of the rough edges have smoothed out (like shifting the manual transmission into reverse) and I haven't had any major problems.  Gas mileage in mixed city/highway driving has improved from an initial 22 mpg to now a consistent 26 mpg. The engine won't ever get mistaken for a V-8 but insurance is cheap and it has enough power to keep up with (and many times pass) the majority of traffic at a stoplight.  If you have the chance to get the 460 watt CD changer, by all means, get it.  It is truly an awesome stereo.  I was afraid that with only bass and treble controls, the sound would be sub-par.  Wow, was I wrong.  Ford's really done their homework with this one.  Sound throughout the audible range is well balanced and clean.  The ride isn't overly stiff but handles nicely in moderate corners.  The 4-wheel disc brakes do a nice job of stopping.  Not sure about brake fade.  I've never had to stop repeatedly or raced it on a track.  Most items are easy to get to under the hood.  With 100 pounds of kitty litter in the trunk and the optional traction control on, winter driving is manageable if you take an interest in learning to control a rear-wheel-drive car in slippery conditions.  I don't have much trouble keeping up with traffic on snowy mornings.

Things I Don't Like
My A-1 gripe with the car is the way the accelerator hangs up during shifts (when you let off the gas and push in the clutch for a shift, the engine RPMs don't drop off, they stay high - or get higher - unless you stay off the gas for 4-5 seconds).  I took it into the dealer to get it fixed only to find out that it's designed that way.  It really makes you sound like you've driving a manual transmission for all of one day.  Boy-racer tricks like heel-and-toe and controlling drift with the throttle are all but impossible due to this silly design feature.  I understand that the V-8s don't have it.  I sure wish mine didn't.  I have the tinted-clearcoat red (laser red).  It's fairly obvious that the clearcoat from the factory gets kind of thin around the passenger side rear of the car (near the gas filler).  The shine is noticeably shallower there.  Many of the sheetmetal features don't line up very well either.  They aligned the major ones well at the factory (like the creases at the bottom of the side windows) but if you look closely, others aren't very close at all.  Other problems I've had are:  brownish staining on the aluminum wheels, outside rear view mirror glass getting mottled, and a minor water leak in the passenger side roll-up window.  Lastly, I wish Ford would have offered a fully adjustable seat on this model.  The seats are comfortable enough for 1/2 to one hour trips but if they go much beyond that, I find my lower back getting fatigued.  A manually adjustable lumbar support and firmer padding all around would have helped a lot.
