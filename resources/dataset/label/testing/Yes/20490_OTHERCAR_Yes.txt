            We have recently bought a 1994 Delta Royale 88 LSS with power everything, leather interior, the works. It was definitely taking a step up in comfort. It is the best car I have ever driven in. Just like one of the reviewers has said, its quiet, and smooth. The car hugs the road. You feel like it is a part of you. We have had the car for 2 months now, and you would think that being a bigger car, it would be a gas hog, but it isn't. It is pretty economical. We had a 1981 Nissan prior to this car, and it was pretty economical on gas, and this Olds is pretty comparable. The V6 engine has a lot of power. You have to be careful when you are on the highway because you could be going 80 and not even know it!! That's how smooth the ride is. The car is also very roomy and comfortable. The leather seats have good lumbar support. I sat in the back to get a different perspective and was so pleased to see how much room there is. My kids don't feel cramped anymore. We are very happy with this car and we take good care of our vehicles. We hope to have this car for as long as we need it, without problems at all. Of course, there is upkeep, but overall, this is a sturdy car.<br><br>
