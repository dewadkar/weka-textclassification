            I recently bought a used 1997 Plymouth Breeze with 44,000 (about 25,000 miles for my friends south of the border).  It is jet black with the basic package.  I purchased it for $13,300 (Canadian currency of-course) and with my budget, it was the best car, with the greatest value.  The car is sleek, good looking and fast (thanks to the 150 hp Mitsubishi built 2.4L, 4 cylinder, 16Valve engine).  And speaking of power, we all know the most unwanted word comes up in a 20 year old guy's mind, insurance, and yes, with today's insurance rates sometimes being more expensive than the monthly payments (ugh!) this car surprised me.  Being the 4 door family sedan, this car packs a well hidden punch on the road (of-course when you only have to...he he he)and, i am paying the same insurance my father pays for his 93 chevy, HA! This car might not be too popular with the younger crowd, however, for its price, power and good looks, this car surely can turn heads, and after all, it is what a kid wants in a new car? 
Another issue i really enjoy about the car, is its on road performance.  The three factors included are acceleration, comfort and efficiency.  I strongly believe that the car excels in all three.  The car is very quick and can accelerate past every obstacle, the ride is smooth and comfortable due to its sport bread suspension and finally the efficiency to performance ratio its excellent with its excellent miles per gallon ratio.

In my conclusion, i would like to say that i am very satisfied in my purchase and i believe that the car deserves to be recognized<br><br>
