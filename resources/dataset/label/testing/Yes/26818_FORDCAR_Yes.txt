            After having my mini-van hit with $12,000 damage and luckily no injures to my children.  I needed a safe, stronger, tougher vehicle.  

My husband brought home my Silver Expedition with is wonderful.  I feel safe, hardly anyone pulls out in front of me anymore.  My four year old calls it &quot;Mommy's Tank&quot;.  It drives so nicely, more like a car than a truck.  I can park it almost anywhere.  I just wish that it got better gas mileage (12/16) or that California gas prices would go below $1.89.

I do not own the Bauer Edition, just the Expedition it cost a bit.  But my families safety is worth every penny.
