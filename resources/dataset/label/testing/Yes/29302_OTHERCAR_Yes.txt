            If you are looking for a hot car this is a definite top five. The Chevy Camaro has four different styles to it. You can have the two door coupe, the two door convertible, the Z28 two door convertible and the Z28 two door coupe. The nicest one in my opinion is the Z28 two door convertible. If you are a guy driving this car you know it is a chick magnet. A lot of girls go absolutely crazy over this car. F. M. N. hard.  There are a few things I didn't like about this car though. I didn't like the fact that it fits only three people but not to comfortably. I have to say that the seats are very comfortable if your in the front. Not more than one person should be in the back seat at one time because it is to small.  Also if you have a want a nice system in your car you will have no trunk so there is no place to put things if you want to take a road trip. I used to drive a Ford Bronco 2. This was a huge difference in driving. I cannot see as far ahead of me while I am driving because it is so low to the ground, and because it is so low to the ground it is a pain to get out of. I was used to having to step down a decent distance to reach the ground in the truck and it was pretty comfortable to get out of. I feel to low to the ground, it is like you have to pull yourself up to get your feet outside then push off the car to get out. It is very uncomfortable that way. If you like to race cars with your friends this is one you would like to have. It is very much aerodynamic so it is easier for you to pick up speed and maintain it. If you decide to race it on a regular street make sure there are no pot holes because this car bottoms out easily. It will wreck the bottom of your car if you continue to go over pot holes or bumps. In my opinion it is not worth it. This car is all about the looks and speed but that is it<br><br>
