            Well, let me get this out of the way first: I'm not a professional car reviewer. I'm 21 years old, and I certainly haven't driven 30 different cars in my lifetime, nor have I taken 10 different SUVs on road tests before making my purchase. Like college, my computer, and just about every other decision I've made, when I like something, I stick with it, and I really could care less about what else is out there. I go with my gut. On that note, I'll tell you why I'm more than pleased with my decision to buy a Jeep Liberty Sport.

The first thing I really liked about the Liberty was the fact that it was very straight-foward about what it was. It's advertised as an everyday errand runner with off-road abilities, and that's exactly what it is. Image means a lot, like it or not, and as much as I appreciate Nissan's vision of the Xterra as a car you can take up to the mountains while you're rapelling after work, 95% of the people who buy SUVs aren't going to take it seriously offroading. I'm in that 95%, and so I don't want a car that looks like that (or the features that come with it that I'll never use). Similarly, the Honda Element is aimed at my exact demographic as the "ultimate road trip car". However, I have yet to meet anyone at college that just packs up for a weekend and goes biking and such in the mountains... thus I don't feel like sitting in a car made of rubber, either. And finally, I didn't want a CRV, a car that basically pretends to be an SUV but is actually a car... I mean, I would like to be able to drive ofer a pothole here and there (I do live in Pittsburgh, after all), without fearing for the life of my car. What does this all mean? The Liberty is very practical. It has SUV abilities like driving over rough terrain very easily, but it also allows me to do my everyday tasks without feeling like I'm driving a beast. I like that.

So, even though the Liberty is indeed a "cute" car, it has enough of a masculine look to appeal to me, and so I moved to the inside of the car. Obviously, the first thing that I paid attention to was the engine. The 3.7L engine produces 210HP and 235ft/lbs of torque and has a stroke of blah blah blah blah. Look, the car weighs 2 tons, but with this engine, you will never feel like you don't have enough power. It doesn't have a crazy amount, at which point you would be nervous about controlling it, and yet it never struggles to provide the power you need, as I've sometimes felt while riding in my friend's CRV. The Liberty pulls along nicely until about 3100 RPMS, when it really starts to take off. The engine also gets quite loud at this point. I can understand that this would annoy some drivers, but I personally enjoy the growl the engine puts out when it starts working hard. The transmission is a 4-speed with electronic overdrive and, despite the knocks I've heard in the past about Mopar transmissions, I've found the Liberty's automatic to be very smooth under normal driving. It shifts a little harder when you take it up to 4000 RPMs, but it's nothing drastic. The one knock I do have on the transmission is that it does tend to be a bit trigger-happy. By this I mean that when going up hills, or when pressing the gas harder, the transmission sometimes kicks in unwanted. Every once in a while, it will downshift one gear, then downshift another and, while I enjoy the power being delivered, I find it unecessary most of the time. However, this doesn't happen often enough to be a major annoyance.

On a quick side note, the Liberty supposedly is offered with a 2.4L engine in the Sport models. However, I couldn't for the life of me find one anywhere... not that I wanted it. I have difficulty imagining a) how this engine would lug 4,000lbs around, and b) who on earth would want it. I suppose if you really needed to save on gas, you'd buy it, but I really think the power would be disappointing. Like I said, though, I have yet to see any... in a dealer, or on the road.

After experimenting with the engine, I checked out the interior. I definitely liked the white face gauges that are standard on the Liberty. I also like the way the console and everything is set up. This is a newer model, so I was actually surprised at how straight-foward everything was... I was expecting some confusing set-up as is becoming more and more common as more and more useless features are added to cars. The only thing odd about the console is the window controls. They're in between the two front seats, and I have yet to have someone sit in my car and not ask where the hell the window button was. It takes some getting used to, but it's not that bad. I just don't understand why they couldn't slap a couple of window switches on the front doors. Another interior annoyance is how loud the turn signals are, although this is sometimes helpful when you forget to turn them off when switching lanes. Anyhow, the rest of the interior is very appealing. I really appreciate the room I have in the drivers seat, as I am a big guy at 6'4". The back seats have decent leg room, though certainly nothing spectacular, but I like that the backseat passengers are within talking distance, unlike the van my parents used to have. Because of this, you can still have the "road trip" feel in the car, and you can talk to the backseat without shouting.

The Liberty, while more car-like than other SUVs, still suffers from some truck drawbacks. Number 1 on the list is the gas consumption. The car gets 16 city and 20 highway miles per gallon, which certainly isn't the worst in its class, but what kills it is that the tank is rather small. At 18.5 gallons, you'll feel like you're spending more on gas than you really are, only because you'll be there more often than in other SUVs with the same (or worse) gas mileage. The other drawback is the body roll the car suffers. It's not really all that bad, and it's certainly less than what my old sedan suffered, but it is there, and you may find yourself slowing down at times to avoid it. Despite this, the Liberty does surprisingly well (to me at least) in turns. I can go through even tight turns very easily, without feeling like I'm losing even the slightest bit of control through it's entirety.

Finally, the cargo space, though not immense, maximizes the room it does have. You won't be lugging home someone desk or dresser, but you can fit just about anything the average person would need to haul. In my short ownership, I've been able to carry four golf bags and a few cases of pop with friends in the car, been able to haul home a dryer from work, and carry several suitcases and bags with passengers on vacation, and lug 40 fold-up chairs to a friends house with the seats down... and still had room to spare. In other words, you probably won't find yourself needing more space than the Liberty offers, provided you're using it in the way it was intended. I also appreciate the fact that the glass opens on the tailgate with the push of a button, rather than just unlocking. I like walking out of a mall, pushing a button, throwing a bag in, and shutting it, all in one motion, without having to take apart the car to do it.

All in all, I'm really impressed with my Liberty. This is coming from someone who swore they would never buy an SUV. However, after driving one (and having my mom's around for a test drive), I was sold on it. Besides the fact that the size of cars becoming ever smaller doesn't benefit someone of my stature, I like that I can carry 4 passengers, their bags, have a reasonably comfortable ride, and not be deathly afraid of running into some rough terrain. It's really an all-purpose car for all-purpose people. There are alternatives in it's class for sure, but I don't feel that any of these captures the crossover of the whole class like the Liberty. Some, like the Xterra, wrongly assume that people who buy their car really will be climbing mountains with it and such, when most of the people who buy it are using it for getting groceries. Others, like the CRV, are too car like for me. I do hear a lot about the 4Runner from Toyota... but I don't think that $7000 dollars more is worth slightly more power... especially when I feel I have more than enough power with the Liberty, and when this is a lease, and Toyota's long-term reliability doesn't come into play. Even so, it is an alternative you may want to check out if you aren't as restricted price-wise as I am.


Note: I would also just like the mention that, although I did not test my vehicle off-road yet, it is pretty much agreed upon by major car reviewers that the Liberty is far and away the best off-road vehicle in this class of cars, as should be expected. For more on this, just read Edmunds.com off-road comparison for this class.
