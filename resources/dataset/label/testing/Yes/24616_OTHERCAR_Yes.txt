            I just acquired my 3rd I30, this time a 2000 model, and after just over 1,000 miles, I'm very happy. The car is luxurious, roomy, comfortable, and drives very nice. 

The I30 is sleek and attractive, MUCH more attractive than the (by comparison) clunky 1998 I30 that I used to drive. While that car was just as comfortable and had nearly as many features, it wasn't as luxurious and it didn't look nearly as nice. 

New for 2000 (the new 2001 model is almost identical) is a power rear sunshade to keep the car cooler on hot days; a two-driver memory seat feature that is very convenient, moving the seat to your position when you start the engine; cup holders in all shapes and sizes everywhere you look; a fold-down rear seat (the old car only folded down half the rear seat); a nicer, more ergonomically designed &quot;cockpit&quot; for user friendly driving; and much, much more. You can also add a very nice navigation system; too bad it's nearly $3,000 more. 

Everyone mentions the cool looking analog clock when they get into my car. I like the buttons and levers, which are much nicer and easier to use than my old car. 

Driving performance is about the same as the older I30s that I've driven. This is a very nice car to drive. It hugs the road well, accelerates beautifully and quickly, and has an excellent feel. Driving the I30 is a wonderful experience. It's V-6 engine has tremendous acceleration. I wish the gas mileage was better, though. 

Admittedly, the I30 is a sleeker, more luxurious Nissan Maxima. Most people feel that you get just as good of a car if you get the Maxima and they're probably right. Infiniti claims that the two cars are much more different than in the past, but I doubt it. 

Still, conventional wisdom says that the I30 is approximately the same as the Maxima, but costs a few thousand dollars more. Au Contraire! My shopping showed that similarly equipped Maximas were selling for more (nearly $2,000!) than the I30 that I eventually got. I think this is because there are so many different Maxima models that when you finally get to one that is comparable to the I30, you're in a very expensive price range for the Maxima. I also wonder about the trade-in value of a Maxima given that there are models selling for less than $20,000 and nearly $30,000. The I30 is feature-filled; you can't add much more than a navigation system and a CD-changer (it comes with an in-dash single disc CD and a seven speaker Bose stereo). 

Infiniti's customer surveys show that nearly 96% of their owners are very satisfied and intend to buy another one. It makes sense. There's not a better value on the market. The Acura TL, a great car, is more expensive, yet smaller and less comfortable. The Lexus ES300 similarly equipped, is about $4,000 more than the I30. And it's also a smaller car. Infiniti makes a great car, probably the best value on the market. 

I'm a pretty loyal car owner, having driven three Honda Accords in 12 years, grown tired of those excellent vehicles, then moved over to I30s. I haven't grown tired of those yet. It's likely that I'll keep this one for several years before getting another one, which could very well be another I30. 

The I30 features pretty much everything you need in a car - comfort, convenience, looks, driving performance, good sound, and lots and lots of features. Completely redesigned for the 2000 model year, the Infiniti dealers told me that they were selling twice as many of these compared to my &quot;old&quot; 1998 model when it was new. Infiniti's slogan is &quot;Own One and You'll Understand.&quot; Believe me, I do. Drive one and you will also.
