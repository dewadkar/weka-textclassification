            I have owned my 2002 Acura MDX Touring version for eight months, and I'm just as happy with the car today as I was the day I bought it. I use it for daily commuting as well as extensive off-road junkets and driving on snow and ice in the Sierra. The MDX handles it all with grace and aplomb, inspiring confidence and trust.

The MDX's crisp handling, minimal body roll, and tight turning circle belie its 4,000 pounds of bulk. Acceleration is reasonably quick, braking distance is fairly short (assisted by ABS), and the ride quality is good (a bit busy on urban roads but very competent off-road). The front seats are very comfortable. In short, the MDX behaves and drives like a large but nimble car.

By comparison, a brand-new 2002 Land Rover Discovery that I rented behaved, rode, and drove like a truck. I couldn't wait to get back to my MDX.

My car was delivered quickly in the color I wanted (Havasu Blue) and without a single flaw or defect. It has been trouble-free, even though I have not babied it. I rate the build quality excellent. Dealer service has been excellent as well, so far. The staff is courteous and the car is ready when promised, but I can't rate the mechanics based solely on an engine oil and rear differential oil change. Acura keeps me up to date on recalls and my maintenance schedule on a personalized website.

Satellite navigation is, for the most part, a useful accessory, although I tend to go places that have not been digitized and placed on the SatNav DVD. If your location and route are on the DVD, SatNav works very well. The "female" route narrator (dubbed "Ginger" by my wife) is fun -- for a while. Kids who haven't experienced SatNav before love to go for a ride in "Arnold" (as in Schwartzenegger) just to hear Ginger tell me every move to make. 

The display panel that SatNav uses is not particularly versatile. I wish I could monitor more functions than just gas mileage, range, current time, and the like. I'm an IT guy and wonder how difficult it would be to "hack" the panel (that is, the programming on the DVD). I gather that Acura has upgraded the panel for its 2003 MDX Touring.

If you plan to go off-road or to ski resorts in your MDX, I recommend purchasing the optional heavy-duty rubber floor and load area mats. They protect your carpets from mud, snow, spilled drinks, etc. Well worth the money.

Arnold is a bit thirsty. I average about 14 MPG around town and 22 - 25 MPG on the highway. The MDX requires premium fuel, which is expensive in California. The excellent 17" Michelin Cross Terrain SUV tires will be expensive to replace. The MDX comes with a "doughnut" temporary spare, which saves weight and ground clearance (it lives under the car, beneath the load area, and is easily lowered to the ground with a built-in winch).

The MDX is one of Acura's first very low emission vehicles.

I've owned several very nice cars -- and the MDX is easily the best of the lot. I've never been happier with a big-ticket purchase. The MDX is a very competent vehicle. As Arnold would say, "I can handle it."
