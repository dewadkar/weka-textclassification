            I've had this truck for 4 years now.  I got it as a gift from my father who had it for about 5 years.  When I got it, it had about 160,000 miles on it, it now has 226,000 miles.

Here's what the truck's gone through:
Clutch replaced twice - one was two years ago, the other was five years ago.
Brakes replaced a couple times, not sure exactly how many
Tires replaced once - Three years ago
Ran into a large doe (deer) 3 1/2 years ago - I don't recall what damage was done, though I do remember it cost my insurance company in the neighborhood of $3000.  I hit the deer head on as the deer was landing in front of me.  The front end was crushed in about a foot or so, and they replaced the hood, grill, and the front-right portion of the body.  The truck stopped dead where it hit the doe, by the way.
Hit by three trees on three separate occasions (no really, they hit me, I didn't hit them; two were caused by storms knocking them down, the other just kind've fell on me I guess from the wind).  One of them landed on the bed as I was going about 30 mph and left a dent and scratches, another landed in my grill, but the trunk was only a couple inches thick at that point so all it did was knock out my lights and bend up this guard beneath the grill, and another landed a little bit ahead of me with a huge trunk that I thought was going to kill me, but I managed to swerve through it's branches instead (into oncoming traffic on a 60-mph highway), after that one I needed a new windshield, grill, lights, wiper blades, and counseling to ease my paranoia that mother nature was trying to murder me.
Clutch master and slave cylinder replaced a month ago
Battery replaced five years ago
Regular oil changes and preventative maintenance
Headlights have been changed twice, brake/license plate/turn signal lights have been changed once in the time I've had it

Here's what the truck hasn't had done, but needs:
Some new wires that have been nibbled on by rats/mice
Another battery
Power steering leaks slightly, but it's not really a big deal
Muffler's rusty
Wiper fluid has a leak and can only be filled half way
A mud-flap got torn off by my tire when I was backing up

Basically, my experience with this truck has been good, as was my father's.  It's required much less maintenance than any other car that can go that long, and it's still going strong.  After I hit the deer, the dealership fixed the truck for me, and they did a wonderful job.  If anything, the truck was better after getting fixed than before hitting the deer; almost made me want to back into another deer so I could get a new bed, and maybe lock a deer in the cab so I could get that re-done, as well  (Joking - I'm not that evil).  Anyhow, I was impressed at how the truck did in the collision as far as safety goes.  The truck stopped as if it hit a ton of bricks, but I wasn't injured.  I realize a doe is a relatively small animal, but this was a very big one (I found out why when I gutted her to eat - best for you not to try to figure out why).  The one complaint with this truck is the rear end is too light, so I keep a couple sandbags back there.  If you don't know why a light rear end matters, it's because for one you get no traction and for another you're affected by the wind.  The truck is definitely no beast like what you see today, but it's still tough as a rock.  I do drive in conditions where I need the four wheel drive quite frequently, and I also load the bed up a lot.  In the truck's entire life, it's broken down twice - once from a bad clutch, and the other from hitting the doe.  I can always count on my truck and I've been happy with it despite it being a deer and tree magnet.  It's never gotten stuck before, and can go just about anywhere.

The proprietary tools thing in the cons list is dealing with changing the head lights.  Changing the head lights on this truck is a major task, and these little pins that you're supposed to buy a special tool for are near impossible to take off without it.  Looking at a Toyota repair manual, I saw that that wasn't the only repair that requires Toyota tools.
