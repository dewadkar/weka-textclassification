            My parents bought our Pontiac Grand Prix about two years ago from a used car dealer. It had about 35,000 miles on it at the time, and ran very smoothly. I was very impressed with the quick and smooth acceleration and the quiet engine. When stopped at red lights there were many times when I had to double check to make sure the car was actually turned on!

<b>Exterior</b>

In person, the exterior of this car looks great. We have the two door model, which gives it an added flavor of power and speed. It's like driving a huge bullet. Other than that, there really isn't much to say about the exterior. I love it.

<b>Interior</b>

The interior has fabric bucket seats, which are quite comfortable. I like them especially because they keep me from sliding back and forth while navigating corners. Even after hours of driving it's still a comfortable ride. The back is also equipped with bucket seats, so everybody gets to be comfortable.

The gauges are analog and positioned nicely. I've driven many cars that have poorly positioned gauges and it's quite annoying to keep peering around the steering wheel while you're driving to see whether or not you're about to run out of fuel. That definitely isn't a problem with this car. 

Even though the car is somewhat compact, it has a very spacious trunk. I can even carry my bicycle around in it when I need to. I read another review on this model of car earlier which said that they don't have trunk lights. That may be true for the car being reviewed, but this car certainly does have a trunk light.

The steering wheel is ergonomically designed and feels great to hold. It's also equipped with controls for the radio, such as Volume and Seek. This feature adds ease and safety; I no longer need to take my eyes off the road to switch radio stations.

This car has a good sound system. I'm not sure of the make/model of the speakers, or the wattage, but it has a quality sound and can be turned very loud before any distortion is heard. The radio and tape player have never given me trouble, either. 

However, since we first bought this car I've noticed that the radio antenna keeps coming loose. When I'm driving (and especially while riding in the back seat) I often hear it rattling around. It doesn't seem to loosen enough to fly off, but I suppose it could if you don't bother to keep tightening it.

<b>The Shifter</b>

Our Grand Prix model has an automatic shifter. The gear selector is placed between the driver and passenger, much like a manual shifter, for easy of use. It worked perfectly for a long time, however it has developed a slight problem. The shifter can slip from Drive to Neutral without having to press the shifter button. Although this has never happened to me while driving, it is possible to bump the shifter from Drive to Neutral while speeding down a highway. I can't imagine this being a good thing for the car, or the driver. I haven't checked to see if this problem can be repaired, but it's not a big deal just so long as you know it can happen. Even if it can't be repaired, it's probably just a quirk limited to this one car.

<b>How It Drives</b>

The V6 engine in this car is great! Whether you're drag racing or cruising along the highway, you can rest assured that this car has the guts to do it. I've had it up to 90 MPH before and it was still very smooth. I could probably get it up to 120 MPH if I tried, but I'm not going to. :-) Cornering is smooth and acceleration is very fast! <i>Most other cars I've driven pale in comparison to the quality and driveability of the Grand Prix.</i>

However, if I'm sitting in a traffic jam for too long the car just loves to overheat. It's probably because of the high miles on it now, but it's something to watch for.

<b>Accidents and Repairs</b>

About a year ago my Mother was driving this car and hit a taxi (The Taxi's fault, and no one was hurt). The forward-left quarter of the hood was smashed. However, the engine suffered relatively little damage. I believe only the radiator needed to be repaired. It still cost about $5000 to fix all the cosmetic problems, but the insurance paid for most of that. If she had been driving some other car, chances are there would've been much more damage. Even with it's very fast look, the Grand Prix seems to be very well designed for accidents, too.

Earlier this year the rear wheel bearings started to squeal. We had them replaced, but it was costly and annoying. Shortly after that the transmission died. It turns out the transmission fluid either leaked out or evaporated. Probably our own fault for not checking often enough, but it still cost $1500 to fix.

The car is actually in the shop right now because the front brake rotors wore down too much and started squeaking. The cost is about $140 per rotor, plus brake shoes and labor.

The car now has about 120,000 miles on it, so I guess all these repairs are to be expected.

<b>Overall Impression</b>

Although this car has some problems, what car doesn't? My Mom puts at least 600 miles per week on this car (most of them highway miles), so it hasn't exactly been pampered. It's a hard working car and we're very lucky to have it. I just hope I can own one of my own someday. :-)<br><br>
