              In March of 1999, we purchased a new Saturn SL2. I love the size because it is easy to get around town, and you can always find a place to park.  The dent resistant panels are also great because the exterior always looks new. But, the biggest plus of all is the GAS MILEAGE.  It's even better than reported.  
 However, we have been plaqued with minor problems.  The auto trunk opener had to be replaced, the rear window motor had to be replaced, and even after 4 FOUR trips to the dealership for repair the low fuel light refuses to operate.  These quirks are a little annoying.  I realize they are not major problems and for the most part we are satisfied with the car.  
  As I said before, the big benefit of owning a Saturn SL2 is definately the gas mileage.  We get over 25 in town and over 30 on the road.  With gas prices soaring this is an important issue. 
  To take on the road, however, I wish I had waited and looked at the L series that came out just a few months later. The back seat is not a comfortable place to even place kids for an extended period of time.  Plus, the close quarters make stretching out difficult on those long trips.
