            This car is the ultimate driving machine!  Being inside this car is like being a pilot and riding in a cockpit.  In the interior, you can reach all the controls without having to reach over, it all being at arm's length.  

The handling is great, with even the slightest turn of the steering wheel, it glides on the road.  It makes even the most unsmooth pavements drivable.  

The acceleration is EXCELLENT, making driving fun!  This is truly a unique sports car, being that it is so much bang for your buck!  I cannot simply love a car more than this. <br><br>
