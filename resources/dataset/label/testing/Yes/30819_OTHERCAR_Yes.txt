            This is a great camera.  It produces high quality images in all lighting conditions.  I am amazed at the beauty of the pictures it creates.  I have used at least 4 or 5 other digital cameras and this one has the best image quality.

It also has excellent battery life.  My NiMH batteries last a long time before needing a recharge.

It has a nice set of resolution/quality settings.

Some &quot;could be better&quot; items:

Doesn't support 32meg SmartMedia unless you have it upgraded for $50.

Doesn't have much on-screen setup.

Some of the setting methods are &quot;hidden&quot;  e.g. You have to hold down one of the buttons while turning the camera on in order to get to the clock/date setting screen, which you would never know without the manual.

I wish it came with a camera sized case.



I believe it is the best camera available in its price range.<br><br>
