            I bought my 1994 model year Saturn in October of 1993. Fresh off the assembly line, I waited six weeks for delivery. Well worth it too. 

Love: the reliability, worry-free driving and low (very low) maintenance. 
Hate: no power package was available on the SLR and I just missed the new green color. 

This vehicle, for being just a car with seats and four wheels and a four banger under the hood, has great power in the standard stick. (Four on the floor for the knowledgeable.) It is a sincere pleasure to drive. Nimble in heavy traffic and GREAT on gas!!! Never a problem to park it. Insurance is so low on it; they may pay me to insure it shortly. (Well, not quite, but extremely reasonable rates.)

This vehicle is great for the young and the young at heart. Those of you with safety concerns, look no further. In this driverï¿½s opinion, it's as safe a Volvo, without the hefty price tag. Not for those looking for anything extra or glitzy. Will get you from a to b without costing a fortune in reliable and sensible style. Exterior (and interior) still look good even after years of heavy city commuting. Still holding onto it's value as well.

*(Note: OTD in amount paid means Out The Door.)
