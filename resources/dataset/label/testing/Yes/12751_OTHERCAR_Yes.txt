            To make pictures is my hobby. But for my job as a University professor I need to explain my studentteachers different situations. Good pictures can be an easy way to explain. Traditional taken pictures take too much time  to produce for instance an overhaead-sheet.
Last month (November) I've bought a Fuji MX 2700.
What a surprise: How easy to make a picture and to use it to show to my students.
The biggest surprise was how easy to make MACRO-pictures of a very high quality. For my job nice to make short distance pictures from children's work/drawings/products.
 Even a picture from a book is easy to get in and to present on screen to the students.
This camera is given you an extreme nice quality (2.300.000 pixels).
I have bought together with my camera a flash memory card of 32 MB.
Related to the quality of the picture I can take up to more then 700 pictures on one very small chip.
Even the battery is very nice to use: a lithium one.
The camera offers you an easy way to review directly the just taken picture after that you can decide to reject or accept the pictures: economical !
I'm very glad to have bought this camera. It gives me a very good opportunity to illustrate my lectures and nice for the studentteachers: they become more involved because I show pictures from their own classroom-situations.
If there is no computer available, then you can produce the pictures on a TV-screen.
The camera is easy to handle and very small, but with a fine TFT screen.
By computer you can easy illustrate your text or sent a copy to friends. This camera is also a nice thing to use with your family.
The camera comes together the software PhotoParade. A nice product to introduce your pictures to a movie.
