            First off let's get the car's likes in: 
Great gas mileage, solidly built and an interior that still looks good, not dated like some 10+ year old vehicles.  When getting into a new VW we notice a lot of the same styling and instruments.

The body style was held on by VW for a long time so it doesn't look old, the body style hasn't radically changed over the years which has held the value of the car.  

The suspension is decent, there is no rust, it handles well and all the instruments are well within reach.  The front drivers side strut is clunking - the shop says it needs new ones.   

The seats fold down which opens up the entire back of the car, you can carry just about anything short of a grand piano back there.


The dislikes: 
The Canadian Model we bought (CL) only has a 1.8 liter engine that was taken from the previous years Fox, producing around 90hp, thats a little less than the CX Honda Civic of that year (115hp).  We cant jump right into traffic, it requires a head start.

There is no tachometer (it does have a clock where the tach should go).  That should have queued me in about the horsepower.

The oil filter is upside down and behind a bunch of hoses and hard lines, making it a challenge to change.  It may prevent all but the most hard core car people from changing their own oil filters.  Is that why VW charges so much for a tune-up?  Their employees have special bendy fire resistant oil changing arms?


Mechanical Issues: 
The Air Conditioner died after a year or two out of warranty.  We let it go, as we didn't really need cool air, but then paid the price a few years later as the inside of the AC started to rust, we had it repaired this year for what equals a pretty steep 650USD/1000CDN, the shop said if we had it repaired right away it would have been a lot cheaper.

The plastic bulb that you pour water and antifreeze in cracked, we had to have it replaced.  A year after that the cap on top of the plastic bulb - it's rubber seal cracked and needed replacing.  Both times it caused the vehicle to overheat and require a new head gasket, yes, two head gaskets in two consecutive years.

The plastic cover that goes over the battery terminal - I forgot to secure it tightly after giving someone a jumpstart, it slipped down into the radiator fan and caused the car to overheat (fasten it to the battery area using a wire tie so it doesn't fall into the fan or remove it all together.)Once again, this required a new head gasket (I should get a head gasket punch card?)

The instrument console under the spedometer where the warning lights are is perfect for putting papers and such on, so much so that I usually have all kinds of papers in there blocking the warning lights.  This has caused me to miss temperature warnings that cost us 3 head gaskets worth of time and money.

My biggest concern was the stock jack that came with the car; it collapsed during a tire change.  Later I found out the jack was on a recall list (imagine if a foot or hand was under the car! yikes!)  That's my fault for not keeping my dealership in the loop as to where I was currently living, 'what recall notice?'  

The sensors under the oil filter: Looking under the hood, there are two spark plug looking leads poking out of the bottom of the oil filter mount, practically begging to be pulled off and looked at.  Never unplug them!  Some shops (and drivers *cough*) unplug them for some unknown reason and seldomly put them back on properly.  If you find after you have had your VW serviced or had someone poking around your engine compartment, and the oil light comes on accompanied by a loud 'beeping honk' noise, pull over, unplug the first sparkplug-lead-type-wire from the back of your oil filter mount, look inside it for the connecting wire, connect it properly to the sensor, repeat for the second sensor.  That's it, you have solved the problem.  

*Interesting side note, the first time this happened, my wife was driving home on a 3 hour trip after having the car serviced at an authorized VW dealer.  The oil light came on with the now legendary loud honking noise; she pulled over and proceeded to pour in several liters of oil.*


Conclusion:
Overall the car is awesome, it never breaks down, except for the three year head gasket episode, is great on gas, isn't rusty at all, we even drove it for a year in salty snow country, has a decent smooth feel at highway speeds and hasn't dropped to the ground while I was changing a tire since the jack was replaced.  

I guess it's a testament to the car that we have had since it was new and would be sad to give it up, it's our family car-truck.
