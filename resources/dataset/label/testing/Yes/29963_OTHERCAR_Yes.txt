             Of all the vans that are out there today something still draws me back to the Dodge Caravan. I've thought the Caravan was a great car even before I could drive. I love the idea of more room and better protection. I love the idea of pulling out the backseat for even MORE room! 

 I had never been in a Dodge Caravan until my uncle bought one and I rode it last year. It was a very smooth ride.  There is plenty of seating. The roominess is wonderful. The seats themselves are soft and luxurious. And there is still room in back for some groceries. 

 Being that SUVs are getting such a bad rap, as well as many other little cars..I consider the Caravan a great car for those with kids, it is safer than all the others I have seen. I've watched the crash tests and the Caravan has done well in all of them! So I recommend the Caravan for everybody!
