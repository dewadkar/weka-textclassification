            Let me say first off, I am biased.  I like small things that I can carry around.  It all happened a few years back when I had a video camera that I never used.  I just figured I did not like to shoot video.  Then after my wedding, my wife and I used the wedding cash to buy a very nice and very small JVC video camera.  Everything changed right then.  We found that we used it a bunch more since it was not a hassle to carry.
On a recent vegas trip, I borrowed a digital still camera from my dad.  I loved the results and the ease of sending pics to other people.  I decided to get our own.  I decided to get a smallest camera I could find that supported the features I wanted (2 megapixels, smart card memory chip, different resolutions, sizes, etc and a fast transfer method like USB).  I told a friend what I was looking for and he told me that there was one choice.  The Canon s100 (which was the model before this one).
I looked at several websites that rated cameras.  They all loved this camera.  
That was enough for me.  I went and bought it.  I also got a 64 MB smart card.  The camera only comes with 8 MB.  This is a joke, but all cameras have it.  To do the highest quality pics, at the largest size, the photos come out to 1 MB each.  That would be 8 pics.  With 64, I get 64 highest quality pics, or over 130 of very very high quality medium sized pics.
The quality is the best you will find.  It feels like a little steel brick.
I love this camera.  It is now with me everywhere I go, and as such I can now get everything on film!   The pictures are great!  The user interface on the camera is very clean and easy to learn - this is a bad thing on most digital cameras.  Not on this one - easy to learn.  The display is very good for its size.
Digital is the only way to go.  You can delete a picture right after you take it if you do not like it.  You can use your camera for 1 picture and get to it right away - instead of waiting to develop a full roll.  Odds are, you have plenty of local stores that can print these pictures just like normal pics.  
I would recommend this to anyone!
Downsides:
#1  8 MB chip.  this is the same for every camera I have seen, so it is not really a downside of THIS camera, rather for all digital cameras.  Just budget in at least a 32MB chip when you buy a digital camera.  Expect to pay about a buck a MB.
#2  The zoom.  the downside to a small camera is the lack of zoom.  The S110 has a very limited zoom.  I do not find this to be much of a problem.  90% of all pictures I take anyway are from normal eye perspective (no zoom at all).  If you want a camera that can get close to a bird in a tress from a good distance, this is not the camera.  If you want a camera that you will carry in your pocket ready to catch your kids or friends when needed, it is the best.
#3  The battery.  This is good and bad.  It has a rechargeable battery, and comes with a charger.  This is nice, as you do not need to keep paying for batteries.  The downside is that if you are on the road and taking a lot of pics, you will need to find somewhere to recharge.  It charges full in just over an hour.  If you travel much, I would recommend a second battery.
