            If the price was not so high, it would be the perfect car. It has an excellent engine, luxurious enterior, and extremely safe design. The 430's engine has the feel of a sweet sports car, and the leather seats have the feel of a living room couch. So, this car is nearly everything that is good about a car. It's got an excellent stereo, it's got a sleek design, and it has enough space to fit 5 people who can comfortably spread out. This is what a car should be, and what else would you expect from Mercedes-Benz? If price does not matter, GET this car.   <br><br>
