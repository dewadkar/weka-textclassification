            I've driven Honda Accords for the past 6 years. My last Accord I put over 150,000 miles on it and it ran like it was brand new until I traded it in for this 1999 Honda Accord Coupe. I bought the leather package with the V6 engine and this car has surpassed all my expectations. I'm in sales and drive a lot, calling on my business clients, and the handling of the car is wonderful. The car is very quite and smooth, with great pick up when ever needed.If your looking for a great looking car with a nice ride, very good gas mileage, at a decent price, this is your car...<br><br>
