            I bought this camera so that I could take pictures and post them to the web! I have a Kodak digital too, but, it only let me take 14 or so pictures, which was not enough. 

The quality of the picture, obviously, depends upon lighting, focus, etc. However, for a picture to post on a web site, or, to send out via email, the pictures that this camera provides, even when compressed 50%, are of excellent quality. In fact, it is easier to get a better quality picture from this camera than it was with the Kodak that I first used. No software required!

Setting up the camera to use following the manual provided is easy. It uses floppy disks to store pictures, in a jpeg format, which can be viewed immediately on a computer with a web browser program. The on-line system that keeps track of the time you have left on the battery, and, the number of pictures taken with remaining space available is really handy. I get carried away sometimes when taking pictures, so, that information helps to keep me from missing a shot. Need more pictures, simply insert another disk!

The zoom feature is one of the reasons that I bought the camera. You can't always get close to the object or person that you want to take a picture of, so, I find I use &quot;zoom&quot; quite often. Note, however, that you do have to let this camera focus before you take a shot, and when you use the zoom, it may go out of focus for a second. Also, even if you shut the camera off, the &quot;zoom&quot; stays where you last used it. So, if you zoom in on a subject, you need to zoom out to take a close-up of something else.

The biggest &quot;con&quot; that I have encountered with this camera is that I am used to the &quot;old&quot; style camera where you look through the camera, not at a screen that displays the picture. I keep wanting to hold it up to my eye!

IF you purchase this camera, shop around.... There are deals to be had via an on-line purchase. Make sure you get the battery charger with the camera, as not all merchants include that item in the description (meaning that they &quot;may&quot;, or, &quot;may not&quot; supply it.... why take a chance?). Also, it is a good idea to buy the case and spare battery that is available. The spare battery that comes with the case is actually a better battery than the original one with the camera and the case/battery accessory pack is priced about the same price as the battery alone!

I have read other epinions and opinions about this camera, having done a little &quot;homework&quot; before making my purchase, and one of the most common &quot;cons&quot; seems to be that you can get &quot;better&quot; picture quality from another version, etc. 

Consider this: your picture only needs to be &quot;so good&quot; to post on a web page, and, if you decide you want to print it out, it's only going to be as good a quality as your printer will allow. So, while you can get better image quality from other cameras, what good is it if you can't see it or print it out? (Just my epinion..)

I first saw this camera in a retail store (I bought it on-line, saving about $100). The &quot;salesman&quot; tried to sell me another camera, stating that the &quot;image quality is only &quot;so&quot; good&quot;... well, it's just what I wanted and needed! The quality is really quite good. No, it's not as good as a 35 millimeter film camera, but, it's &quot;perfect&quot; for what I use it for, and I don't have to wait for the film to be developed!<br><br>
