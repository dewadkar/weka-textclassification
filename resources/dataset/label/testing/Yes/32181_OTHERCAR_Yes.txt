            I've been a faithful GM driver since I could drive (and actually could choose my cars! ha ha) and this is my first brand new car... a 1999 Cavalier. The reason why I got it was so I would have something safe to drive my baby around in. It's quite roomy, and has a lot of trunk space for all my baby's things (and groceries!), and it's a nice riding vehicle. I like the fact that the car has punch when I need it to, and the fact that it comes standard with anti-lock brakes is even better. After pricing many cars and test driving them as well, settling on the Cavalier was the best thing I could do for myself and my family. The only problem I have had is that the pin stripes are peeling off and the rugs are shedding, but the warranty actually covers that. The 100K mile warranty was another standard that came with the car, and as long as you keep up on the oil changes and other preventative maintenance, you are covered bumper to bumper.<br><br>
