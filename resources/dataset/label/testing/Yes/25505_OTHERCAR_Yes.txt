            I love my truck! After my last vehicle, (a kia), my Mazda B3000 is terrific.  Not perfect, but definitely a good, tough truck. 

I have the B3000, 5 speed standard, 4x4, extended cab. No power package which I definitely regret.  The B3000 is a big, little truck! If you're under 5'4 or so in height, you won't be able to reach across the seat to lower the window.  The power package also makes it easy to adjust the side mirrors, a plus if more than one person drives the vehicle.

I bought the truck after much internet and consumer complaint site searching.  The Mazda was highly rated by consumer reports both for safety and lack of mechanical problems. The long term picture on the Mazda indicates it is a truck that will last. I liked the ability to switch to four wheel drive without going outside the truck. A definite plus if you are in snowbound areas. Nice throw-ins are that it comes standard with a bed liner, slide window in the back and a cd player.  The steering wheel is adjustable, nice for smaller people. The fold up seats in the cab are small, but support the average size adult. They also come with seatbelts, which is a good touch. Two adults would be cramped, legs on top of each other. A couple kids would be fine.  More importantly to me, the extended cab holds my three dogs, a 100# lab mix, 35# spaniel mix and a second 35 pounder akita mix. With the dogs, having extra doors on each side to get into the back of the cab is a very important advantage.

The front seat supposedly can seat three when the middle combination arm rest and storage box (change, cds) is pushed up; however three is stretching it unless the middle person is a small child. A disadvantage is the seatbelt connectors for the two main seats are unmovable, making it impossible to slide them down between the two seat cushions.  Nothing to noticeable unless you want to sack out on the seat for a nap or slide your sweetie over next to you.

The sound on the CD player is pretty good for a factory included system. There is a shuffle button, however I've been unsuccessful in figuring out how to make it shuffle songs even following the owner manual directions. The cd/radio has an automatic turnoff if the system components are getting too hot which is possible with extended play, (like a cross country road trip). The player will turnoff if components reach a temperature of 167 degrees. On a 1000 mile road trip, the cds and face of the player became so hot that I could barely touch the player or the cds. I'm not sure the temperature safety was working and couldn't get a dealer to verify it was.

Maintenance is pretty easy, requiring not much more than oil changes every 3000 miles and occasional tire rotations.  When the truck hits 15,000 miles, coolant is checked and a few things require lubing. The first tuneup isn't until 100,000 miles.

The truck is set high, so smaller people may have a problem loading into the bed. With an old dog, you'll have to build a ramp because it might not be able to manage the jump. The bed has four tiedowns, one in each corner. I'd like two more, in the center of each side but that isn't a big thing.

Off road, I didn't experience any problems. The truck handles well and with an empty bed, very little fishtailing. I took the truck all over Death Valley in January with not a single problem.

The only drawback to the B3000 is the V6 engine doesn't live up to its promise of power, really slowing down climbing across the Sierra Nevada and ranges of Utah. Without the tow package, don't consider pulling anything up even a small hill.  Better yet, just go for the B4000 and its bigger engine.

The only bad design is how the AC/heat is configured. The air conditioner compressor is engaged regardless of where you turn the selector switch. The only exception is for the vent, however you can't change the temperature of the air coming in.  When you run the heat, you have to adjust the temperature selection to hot, however the AC compressor still is active.  The AC compressor is what will limit your gas mileage a bit.

Finally, the gas mileage isn't the best, but isn't the worst either. I get about 17 mpg in the city.  Straight highway though I was almost doubling that to about 27 - 35 mpg on the flat land.  The tank capacity is 19.5 gallons.  The refuel light comes on with a several gallon reserve.

All in all, the Mazda B3000 is a tough little truck.  With this one, I don't expect to be shopping for a vehicle again for another 100,000 miles or more.<br><br>
