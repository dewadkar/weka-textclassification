            I bought a 1990 Mits Eclipse base model with 1.8L brand new when they first came out in Sept 1989.  I bought a 1991 1.8L GS in 2000 for $1,500 (from a dealership in North Texas, no less).  Both of these cars I drove to 150,000 miles plus.  The 90 I drove from new to 160,000 until I totalled it in 2000.  So pleased with the overall performance of it that I found and subsequently bought a 91 GS model with 1.8L.  I replaced two tranny's on the 90.  One at 75K and one at 125K.  I bought the 91 w/115K and have had no tranny probs whatsoever.  Both automatic tranny equipped.  My 91 now has 152K mi's.  Drive it like a bat out of hell on long road trips, but rather conservatively in the city.  Front two seats are very comfortable, even on long road trips.  Back two seats, don't even think about placing people back there.  HOWEVER, I have taken a couple of parts off of Eclipses in junk yard, and seeing the ones in front end collisions has made me realize that even a small space can become TOO small in the event of a crash.  

Handling in this car compares to today's sports cars.  Mits was well ahead of its time when they designed this one.

Looks compare well with current vehicles when considered against other vehicles.  Meaning, with so many units sold in America in 1990-1991, you see a lot of them.  Although the 1990 and 1991 are becoming rarer on the road.  Alas, the problem may be that even semi-significant repairs equal or exceed value of car.  I took the chance on the '90 tranny at $2000 but it paid off.  No serious engine problems on either car. NONE!
