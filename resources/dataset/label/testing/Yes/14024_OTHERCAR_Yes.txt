            It took me approximately 3 months to decide between this car and the cavalier. Both cars have the same engine just different body styles. At the time I was looking we were only a family of 3. I wanted something sporty looking, gas efficient, and reasonably priced. I fell in love with my car. When my husband was transferred from Maryland to California, I never realized how spacious my car was. We were able to fit 6 suitcases, 2 cat crates, a child in a booster seat, a labrador retriever, toys and ourselves in this car to drive 3000 miles. And talk about gas efficient, we had to fill up about every 430 miles on a 13 gallon talk. Yeah!!! Then my son came along and I was once again afraid I would have to turn my car in for a minivan. That was not the case. On the two door, the front seats move all the way forward making it very easy to put a awkward baby carseat in and out of it with ease.  I LOVE MY SUNFIRE!!!!<br><br>
