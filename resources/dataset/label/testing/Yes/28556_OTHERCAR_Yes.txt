            The Wrangler. The Direct descendant of the 1940's Willys MB &quot;Jeep&quot;. (well, ok, the direct descendant of the 1940's *BANTAM* &quot;Jeep&quot;)

A short history lesson behind this american icon.

(warning, this is a long read. Be prepared and grab a cup of coffee)

Shortly before WWII commenced, the US government found it needed a lightweight vehicle to use as a general purpose truck-thing. Several options were looked at, from normal production 2wd cars, to an intriguing flat vehicle where the driver and passanger lay down along the chassis.

Bantam, a small car company specializing in innexpensive auto's for the depression era, decided to take up the challange, and in less than a month, had designed the predecessor to the Jeep. it was kinda ugly for the time, short, squat, and SQUARE, (who makes square vehicles anymore? things aught to be ROUND! this *IS* the 1930's afterall!)

So, they constructed a prototype, with it's round little headlights, and sent it off to the US Army to have its way with it.

The army went to work on it with everything it knew how. It jumped it towing artillary peices, it put it over the worst terrain imaginable. It ran it in the worst possible conditions that an automobile could possibly find itself in. 

And in the end, battered, bruised, and broken,
the drivers gave up and went home for dinner.

The Bantam prototype however, shone through, and the army decided to award a contract to build this wonderfull vehicle to ba- no, wait. Willys! (Willys?) Willys.  Willys had engineered a slightly modified version that was a touch better. And, since Bantam couldn't produce as many vehicles as Willys could, the award went to Willys. Bantam got the contract to build the trailers, and eventually left the auto business alltogether. 

Willys produced thousands upon thousands of jeeps, along side Ford.
FORD?!?! what the... 
Willys couldn't build enough either, so the US government has ford build the willys model, on the condition that the parts be completely interchangable. Ford couldn't resist the urge to advertise, so several of the early models had &quot;FORD&quot; in big bold letters written on the tailgate and other assembled peices. this was quickly put to the stop by the Army.

When WWII came along, the Jeep was ready, and carried men, supplies, ammunition, etc, to the front lines in any weather, and carried the wounded back, the same way. They were sent in such numbers that the German soldiers SWORE every GI was issued a jeep. 

The Jeep made the quick victory through Europe possible by being able to move supplies and men through any weather, any terrain, any time, and being mechanically simple enough that your average farm boy could fix it.
The german utility vehicle, a very lightweight 2wd Volkswagon, was more often than not mired in mud that the jeeps just plowed through.

a small british force equipped with 12 jeeps and light machine guns completely stopped a german supply column in north afrika, using the 4wd ability and nimble speed to strike hard and run away.

Well, after the war, every GI got home and started the keys to their lumbering cars, and slip-slid their way through the snow, thinking &quot;Where's that danged jeep when I need it?&quot;.

Willys answered the call, registered the &quot;Jeep&quot; trademark (not without legal grumblings from the then-failing Bantam) and sold the original Jeep CJ - Civilian Jeep. It was utterly utilitarian, but it Got The Job Done.

Since then, the Jeep name has been sold and passed on to several companies, finally winding up at AMC, who continued the long line of &quot;CJ&quot; model jeeps, from the CJ-5 model (the last of the extreme short wheelbase jeeps with parts used from the original willys) to the little pickup CJ-8 &quot;Scrambler&quot;, when they stopped production of the CJ line alltogether.

And introduced the Wrangler.

Lower to the ground, and wider, it was supposed to be a &quot;newer, Safer, more comfortable&quot; CJ for the masses, without the tipsy turvey tendancies of the original Jeep. It was a sales sensation. And millions of hardcore Jeep fans cried themselves to sleep, with one thought among them.. &quot;SQUARE headlights? SQUARE headlights?&quot;.   

It was also an off-roading Disaster. Probobly the only Jeep ever made (with exception of the original 2wd Jeepster) that was not able to handle greats such as the Rubicon Trail, stock. It was just too low to the ground, and lacked many important features to an off-road vehicle. But it sold, and it sold WELL, because it was more comfortable than the CJ's it replaced, and AMC didn't have to worry about lawsuits from tipped over wranglers. (they still happened of course).

So, with shouts of &quot;Jeep is Dead&quot;, the hard-core off-road crowd hung their head in sorrow, when AMC was purchased by Chrysler in 1988.
Chrysler made one change to the Wrangler: in the 1990's they changed the tired 258ci Carbourated engine (4.2 liter) to the 4.0 Liter Inline-6 used in the hot-selling Cherokee (which was actually MORE capable than the wrangler at the time!) 

Chrysler then brought out the Grand Cherokee, and the hardcore 4x4 owners sighed, as the wrangler was left in pretty much the same condition it was in 1986 introduction: A Yuppy Jeep. (the body designation of the square headlight wrangler is listed as the &quot;YJ&quot;, was this on purpose?)
It couldn't go off-road, it had SQUARE headlights, and it was no longer selling as well as it could, because it still rode way too rough. 

So Chrysler said they were ending production of the YJ and introducing a new vehicle.  the Hardcore wheelers sobbed once again. They knew what was coming: a smoother riding Jeep. and Smoother Ride means No Off Road. the spirit of the original Jeep was dying.

(what follows here is what I heard from some friends of mine living in the Lake Tahoe area, which is the &quot;entrance&quot; to the rubicon trail)

So, in early 1995, when production lines stopped on the YJ, a group of 4x4 gearheads on the Rubicon Trail in California/Nevada watched in horrer as a heavily camoflagued vehicle made it's way towards the beginning of the trail, with big &quot;CHRYSLER&quot; logos all over it. This was the new vehicle, and Chrysler was about to test it on the rubicon, like it's done with all it's vehicles before. (You see, a longstanding jeep tradition was, if it doesnt make it over the rubicon stock, it doesn't go into production. the YJ made it only by a LOT of rock-stacking and trail-preperation work). 

The Gearheads with their heavily modified CJ's (one even had a WWII era jeep, the original) sat to the side to watch, as the Chrysler trail preperation crew came by and-

removed some stacked rocks left there by someone driving a YJ. 

Wha?

The new camo'd vehicle started up, and went straight up the side, the wheels flexing up and down on both sides of the vehicle like a heavily modified CJ. Now at this point either the front cover fell off, or was taken off, and there sat a shining grille,

with ROUND headlights.

Supposedly someone shouted &quot;JEEP IS BACK!&quot;.

The Wrangler made it over the Rubicon with ease never before seen in a stock vehicle (save the Defender 90, no longer sold in the US), it's Coil suspension eating up rocks like a playfull mountain goat.

and the rumors about the smoother ride?

The coil suspension did that too. the Ride of the new Wrangler is vastly improved over the previous (square headlight) generations. How is that... Possible?

Good engineering. the Chrysler guys earned their pay.

it's still no Honda in the ride department, it will bounce a bit and roll a bit in the turns, but do yourself a favor and test drive a square headlight wrangler (found in increasing numbers on &quot;Used car&quot; auto lots), then step into the new one. a WORLD of difference.

The Soft Top cover for it has even been improved so it's possible for one person to put it up and down within half an hour! (I didn't say it was easy. I just said possible.)

The Dash is very car-like, (which still annoys alot of the hardcore Jeep fanatics, but they can live with it now...) 

It doesn't have alot of space like larger SUV's, but it will carry stuff. and it's 4wd system is primative by any streach of the imagination, but like it's humble beginnings in the 1940's, Gets The Job Done. 

This is what you're thinking of buying. The modern design of a 60 (70?) year old Military Quarter-Ton Utility Truck. It will go off-road. It will go through snow. It will dance on rocks. It will still be annoying to drive on long commutes. 

but it is a Jeep. and this is what a Jeep was built to do. 

(If any question as to the off-road ability of the new Wranglers had remained, while the &quot;YJ&quot; Jeep was reputed to be the &quot;Yuppie Jeep&quot;, chrysler let slip that the new designation was &quot;TJ&quot;. for Trail Jeep.)

and, in 1997 at the Top Truck Challange, (a sort of Olympics for 4x4's), a stock TJ with a simple bolt-on lift kit costing less than $1,000 (called &quot;Terra-Flex&quot;, and designed specifically for the Jeep's quadra-coil suspension), won 3rd place, over trucks with Tens of Thousands of Dollars of modifications made to them. Third place. Not bad for a $16,000 brand new Jeep and $1,000 add-on. 

What came in first and second? 

A modified CJ-2a from the 1940's,

and a modified CJ-7.

one,
two,
three,
Jeep.


Well, ok, that was a fun writing excercize for me, Now lets get down to the nitty gritty:

the Wrangler is powered by a 150hp 4 cylender engine, or a 190 HP 6 cylender engine. In all honesty, both engines will do just fine, I've driven a 4banger around the mountains of Denver and while it wasn't fast, it kept up OK.  

The 6 is preferred, of course. ;) 

the basic transmission is an AX-15 (for the I6, I beleive the 4 uses an AX-5) 5 speed manual, a very strong transmission for a trucklet this size with years of dependable service behind it in several manufacturers lineup (including Toyota).

There are automatic transmissions.

You will not buy an automatic transmission in a Wrangler.

the transfer case is a very simple NV-231 Part Time (means &quot;Don't engage it on dry pavement&quot;) 4wd, and in 2wd mode it is rear wheel drive.

(No. I don't *CARE* that you can't drive a manual. You buy a STICK SHIFT in a Wrangler. Got it?)

the rear axle is either a Dana 35c (basic model, uses a &quot;C-clip&quot;) or an optional Dana-44 (Much Preferred if you're going to go off-road. Get it even if you're not going to go off-road. Dana-44's are Nice Axles. Verygoodyesyes.)

(Look sonny, I don't give a rat's patootie that you can't sip your cafe mocha while driving a stick shift. You are not going to buy an automatic.)

the front is a Dana-30 axle, with automatic locking hubs (Meaning you do not have to step outside and turn part of the wheel to put it into 4wd, just grab the lever and shift while you're cruising along from 0 to 55mph)

(See that guy with the CJ-2 and the tire iron over there? he doesn't think you should buy an automatic either.)

the Hard Top is very nice, but not as much Fun outdoors. the Soft Top is more fun, when it's off. :) 

(No. No automatic.)

The Doors are removable.

(You will learn to use a clutch.)

The interior is hose-washable. 

(I said *NO AUTOMATICS*. Got it?)

Reliability of the Wrangler has much improved since the re-design was introduced in 1997, (1996 was a &quot;dead&quot; year, no wranglers were built), though it was plagued by the bad shipment of Fuel Guage Senders, which would either report you as Empty on half a tank, or 1/4 tank left when it's empty. this has, obviously, been solved now. 

(autmatic has 3 speeds. Standard has 5. More is Better.)

Other recalls were for a possible seat-belt defect, though none ever failed, apparently someone didn't want to take the chance.

(You will not buy an automatic Wrangler.)

The Airbag can be disconnected by a wire switch in the engine compartment, as can the shift-interlock that prevents the vehicle from being started in gear. (WHAT? why do these things? well, one: off-roaders hate airbags. the reasons should be obvious.  Two: an old 4x4 trick, is if the engine SHOULD stall, or die, and you're precariously balanced on a rock and can't exactly get out and fix it where you are, you can use the starter motor to move you to a more safe location. it wears down the battery something feirce, but thats what jumper cables are for....)

(NO. I will personally remove the torque-converter with my bare hands if you order an automatic.)

Where these two are, I will not post here, if you're truely interested, you can find out yourself.

(Good. Feel the shifting motion.)

There's not much else to cover, because as was previously stated, the Wrangler is a very basic vehicle. It will get you there, It will get you back. It doesn't ride like a car, but it makes no excuses for not riding like a car. (It seems to dare you to say &quot;Hey! You don't ride like a car!&quot;)

And it has round Headlights.

(Cars have automatics. Wranglers do *NOT*.)

Is it worth it for you? Test drive one and find out. Particularly in the summer. With your shades on. And the roof and doors *OFF*! :)

(AND NO AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION!)<br><br>
