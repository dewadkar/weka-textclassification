            We always have to have a pickup truck as one of our vehicles for business purposes.  When looking for a new truck, my husband decided he wanted a Chevy, he did not care for how the Ford's looked that year, and we already had a Dodge 1 ton (I wrote a review about it, I miss that truck!)

I enjoy driving the &quot;new&quot; truck, it's a fairly comfortable ride.  The truck has a split bench seat.  This makes it comfortable for the driver and passenger, as both can adjust their seat how they want it ... and also have room for a third person to sit in front if needed.  The center of the seat also folds down for some storage, and also has a clipboard on it for easy writing. (If you're right handed)

The extended cab is nice to have.  If I'm taking the truck shopping, I can put my purchases back there.  When we took the truck to Florida with relatives, we had four adults and three children in the truck, with a comfortable fit.  I personally do not care for sitting in the back, I like leg room, but I feel it's good for small children.  However, I wouldn't recommend a very long road trip with them back there.

Our truck has 4 wheel drive.  This is a nice feature, living in the Northern states, we need it at times.  I find it easy enough to engage the 4 wheel drive, simply by choosing which mode you want and using the shift on the floor.  You do not have to get out of the vehicle to lock in the hubs on this truck.  It's all done inside.  The owners manual says you can engage the 4 wheel drive while driving, but, we've not tried that.

The other options we have are an overhead console with map lights, CD storage, sunglass storage, and garage door opener storage.  The rearview mirror has a compass on it, which is nice if you want to be sure of your direction.  Power seats, power windows and power door locks, with keyless entry also make this truck nice for us.  Our stereo has the cassette player and CD player.  The stereo system is nice, with an anti-theft system on it.  You enter a numeric code and if the radio is stolen, the person can not use it unless they know the code.  There is one problem with this ... if the battery goes dead the radio will think it was stolen, make sure you write down your code!  (Yes, it happened to us *laughs*)

I would recommend at least taking a look at this truck for people in the market.  I'm sure that when we go to purchase a new truck, we will look at the Chevy models again.
