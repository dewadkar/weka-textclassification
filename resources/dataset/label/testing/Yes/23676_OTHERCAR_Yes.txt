                               <b>My Story</b>

       I used to not be terribly interested in the design of cars.  Driving was enjoyable for me not because of the car, but in spite of it.  I simply enjoyed the alone time, listening to music and thinking.  I laughed at people who spent $500 a month to drive exotic cars simply for their looks.  But then one day a couple of years ago I saw the PT Cruiser.
       What a beautiful car.  It's retro-mod fusion struck a chord with me.  I never thought that I was born in the wrong time period, but I've always liked the style of my grandfather's generation more so than my generation.  My wife sings jazz, I play trumpet and I am quite attached to my fedora for which I searched long and hard.
       Never before had I seen such a car; it is smaller than a minivan or an SUV, but bigger than a sedan.  It put a smile on my face every time I saw it.  As time went by and I saw more PT's on the road, I struggled to remain content driving my rust infested 1991 S10 Chevy Blazer.  It was not easy.  At the time, people were on waiting lists to buy PT's and were paying a few thousand over the sticker price to purchase one.  My car gave in and I settled for buying a Saturn SL-2 for $320 a month, losing all hope of driving the car of my dreams.  In a miraculous turn of events, my Blazer was fixed and I was able to return the Saturn without any penalties (except the wrath of the dealer).
       A year later, the desire was renewed after I had saved up some money and we visited a Chrysler dealer, determined not to buy anything that night.  It didn't look good at first.  Beth and I were not going to buy anything for over $250 a month.  We couldn't even purchase a 2001 manual transmission, limited edition even with dealer cash incentives.  My salesman worked hard at it though, and the next day he had a proposal.  With the Chrysler discount, an $800 trade-in and $2000 down, we could purchase a 2002 manual transmission PT Cruiser for a few cents under $250 a month.

                <b>Expectations Exceeded</b>

       After I figured out how to drive the stick (a very rewarding experience) I was able to start enjoying the driving experience.  Never before has driving been so fun.  The first night I had it I noticed the heads that turned. And I thought, <I>this is great!  I get the looks without paying the exotic car sticker price!</I>  My friends couldn't believe that I was able to get one.  However, I quickly found that there are two types of people in this world: those who really like the Cruiser and those who hate it.  Numerous times I have heard that the Cruiser looks like a hearse - something that I just can't see.  Like the Pontiac Aztek, your car will get strong reactions from people.  But that is part of the car's appeal, it makes a statement; it displays your individuality, your taste.
       Driving the Cruiser has transformed the experience of getting from one place to another.  No longer am I driving.  I am <I>cruisin</I>.  And that is why the geniuses at Chrysler gave the car the name "PT (personal transportation) Cruiser".

                      <B>Features</B>

       I like old cars but cannot stand sitting in them for too long; the smell and the lack of airflow is a wretched combination.  The PT Cruiser has that retro look but sports a modern quasi-luxurious interior.  Although the options for interior colors are limited (taupe only), the color scheme blends well.  One cool thing is that the color of the dash matches that of the exterior: if someone has a red PT, the interior is red.  Mine is silver.  A lot of thought was put into the design of the interior.  There are a good variety of textures and colors.
       I am very pleased with the insulation of the car.  The driving noise is almost eliminated.  It also is a great car in which to listen to music and talk with your friends.  It is the first time I've noticed the acoustics of a car.  Try snapping your fingers in your own car and then in the Cruiser and see what I mean.
       Both sides of the front seats are equipped with armrests.  There is a lot of headroom in the front and the back, more so than in my Blazer, oddly enough.  I'm able to cruise while wearing my fedora.  The back seats are raised slightly above the front seats.  My friend once said that this makes people in the back feel like they are more a part of what is going on in the front.
       This is not a performance vehicle.  With a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and 150 horsepower, don't expect to be beating many cars off of the line.  However, pick up a manual transmission and you'll get a lot more out of it.  In addition, the stick gets a couple miles more in gas mileage.  Many have voiced their complaints that Chrysler did not stick a V6 engine in this car, but I am glad that it has the environmentally and pocket friendly "four banger".  Most people won't notice a lack of power in the car.
       Finally, I cannot emphasize enough the practicality of this automobile.  There is cargo space galore.  The seats can fold down and then over separately or they can be easily taken out.  There is a shelf in the back that can assume several positions and has a lot of practical value.  Beth and I are able to carry all of her sound equipment, music stand, speakers stands, my trumpet and a third person.

            <b>To Cruise or Not to Cruise</b>

       If you are in the market to buy a car and can afford a new car, there's no reason not to pick it up.  People pay $20 more a month to drive a Cavalier.  The car has been built for customization so you can add your personal touch.  Chrysler has released several more colors in 2002 and if you like flames they cost only $500.  Why drive when you can <I>cruise</I>?
