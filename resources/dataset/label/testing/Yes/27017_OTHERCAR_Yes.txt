            After performing extensive research on a wide range of digital cameras, comparing such things (not in any particular order) including, but not limited to:
a) the price of camera;
b) the camera's picture quality;
c) the camera's ease of use;
d) customer reviews of the camera; and
e) the camera's size

I decided to purchase the Olympus 450 Zoom over the web from Onvia for approximately $375.  I received it without delay and immediately began taking pictures.  This digital camera is very easy to use and the camera's directions are easy to understand.  I had no prior experience using a digital camera and had no trouble at all getting started.  The picture quality is excellent-the camera offers super high quality, high quality and normal quality settings.  There is a 3X optical Zoom lense. The camera has a built in flash with a number of different settings for various light conditions. You can also choose a number of settings depending on the type of pictures you are taking, from wide angle, to low light, background sun, etc.  The camera is an excellent all around camera. Like all digital camera's battery usage is high, and I would recommend purchasing rechargeable batteries to use with it, as well as the separate ac/dc adapter, so that you can plug it in to the wall when you download pictures.  Overall picture quality is excellent, and I strongly recommend the purchase of this camera. It is also small enough that you can put it in your front jeans pocket (as long as you don't wear very tight jeans).
