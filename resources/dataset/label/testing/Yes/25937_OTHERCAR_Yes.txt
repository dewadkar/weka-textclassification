            My sister in law's 1999 Pontiac Grand Am GT was a very nice car.  It was white with gray interior.  It had a cd and a tape player.  It was automatic.  I think that it was a V6.  It drove really well.  It had some good take off from  a stop.  You hit the pedal and you are gone.  It had automatic windows and door locks.  There was a remote control to the doors, trunk and a panic button.  The front seats were bucket seats and the back seat was a bench seat.  There was not a lot of room in the back seat.  But what do you expect from a sports car?  Not much room is usually for all of them.

She did have one problem out of it though.  After one week of having the car the air conditioner went out.  On a brand new car!! She was the first owner!  She had to take it to the shop to have it fixed.  The car dealer ship told her that the air conditioner was not covered under the warranty.  They ended up fixing it because it was only a week after she bought it.

This car handles great.  It is like it is on rails.  When you take a curve going fast you stay on the road.  It has antilock brakes.  This is a good feature for both rain and snow.  There is also an oil change light.  The seats are confortable while you are riding in the car.  It would be good for road trips.

The sound system is nice, the cd and tape player with 6 speakers and built in equalizer. It  has great clarity to it.  The bass is very good for a factory set of speakers.  Having both a tape player and a cd is nice.  You don't have to have just one in the car.  I use both my cd and tape player in mine!!  I think that you will like this car if you get it.  It is a very nice car.  As long as the air conditioner works!!

Leave me comments about what you think about my review!!

Thank you for reading and have a good day!!
