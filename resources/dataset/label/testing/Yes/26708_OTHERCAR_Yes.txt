            I used to hate taking photos.

I would have to go out and buy film (or a disposable camera), then be conservative on when I would take pictures, then have to develop the film, and finally have to pick up the film later on.  Plus, if I wanted to share the photos, I'd have to get duplicates, or scan in the pix, etc.

My life has changed when I bought this camera.  Now, I take it everywhere, and have fun taking pictures.  Friends love it as well; because of the viewing window, I get that &quot;Polaroid&quot; party effect with this camera.  Plus, sending pictures to friends is much easier with this camera; I just make a common Xdrive that we share and put the pictures on that.  Furthermore, taking digital pics of my auction items has dramatically increased their auction price.

Now about the camera:  at 1.3 megapixels, its got better resolution than most cameras at the same price range.  With only a standard 8MB card, you won't be able to take many pics at the best resolution (18 pix in fact).  I ended up buying another 32 MB smartmedia card that allowed me to take 73 high res pictures.  The fact that it doesn't have optical zoom is a definite drawback; digital zoom is not much of a feature, since I can do the same thing with Adobe Photoshop.  Also, I don't know if other people had this problem, but my laptop had a problem recognizing the camera using the stock serial cable (this happened with other brands of cameras as well, so I know its a problem with my laptop, not the camera).  In any case, I ended up getting a USB smart media card reader; downloading is faster, and you don't use up your camera's batteries when you do.  

Be advised when using that view screen:  the battery life of the camera with it on is only 40 minutes continuous time.  One problem I had with the camera is the flash; it took me a little time to figure out how to change the flash from redeye reduction (which adds a few seconds delay) to just snap and shoot.  Also, for those of you who have regular cameras, you might not like the fact that you cannot take two high quality pictures in a row because of the writing time delay.  You can change it to a burst mode, but be warned that the resolution of the picture is degraded.  

In all, having a digital camera is well worth it for taking personal photos, fun pictures, and such. And as digital cameras go, the Olympus is a great bargain.<br><br>
