            Why did you buy this vehicle?

I bought this vehicle because I loved it at first sight!  As a designer by profession, I am familiar with the importance of product aesthetics and functionality in the real world.  Before the Vehicross became available to the public, I did extensive research on-line and discovered that there were numerous reviews and initial testings.  The more I read, the more I found that this vehicle contained some of the most sophisticated hardware and technology ever produced in an sport utility. 


Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle.

The first thing that I love about this truck is the fact it looked like it just rolled off the turn table from a car show.  Very few cars, much less sport utilities, ever go untouched from the concept car show level to the production line and out to the dealers.  The Vehicross is that exception and very little was done to tone the looks down from the car show.  Also, I found that Isuzu put together a hand-selected, specialized group of individuals called &quot;the Zip team&quot; who assembled the vehicle by hand and crossed the lines of production and engineering to keep the vehicle's aesthetic integrity.  You can tell that the quality of workmanship is high and that the &quot;Zip Team&quot; didn't leave out any of the details untouched.  I've had this vehicle for less than a year and put about over 25k miles into it mostly due to commuting.  So far, the only time it's been to the shop is for scheduled routine maintenance.  

Because the Vehicross is such a unique and limited vehicle, it'll never go unnoticed in public.  As a result, you can never get used to the attention that this little beauty draws.  The first time I drove this baby home, I remember the double-takes, finger pointings, dropped jaw expressions that I noticed while driving or parked.  I can't ever remember getting so many questions and compliments I got on the road and even at gas stations! However, there are a few of those closed-minded conservatives who squirm or scoff at the sight of this beast. That's fine with me.  Not too many vehicles can be so controversial enough to cause emotional reactions like the Vehicross.  And the fact that there's only going to be limited number of these vehicles, makes it a joy to own and drive something that not everyone can ever have a chance to do in life!

Another quality that I love about this vehicle is the comfort and handling on the road.  Inside, the Recarro seats cradle and hug your body like a large ergonomic glove.  Though the dash instrumentation was plucked from an older Isuzu Trooper model, it was very friendly and easily adaptable to read and understand.  The feel behind the wheel is more like that of an F-14 cockpit in a fighter jet.  Also, the leather bi-colored steering wheel feels real good and comfortable in your hands. One thing I noticed is that the red portions of the steering wheel feels &quot;grippier&quot; than the rest which only is located on the most 'held on' part of the steering wheel.  This adds a nice touch!

But, unlike a fighter jet, the rear view was very limited.  It's not really something I would say I hate.  It was just something I wasn't used to.  However, I had purchased one of those Van Eyes clear polyvinyl lens that resolved the rear view limited visibility which I can now parallel park and back up to walls.  I also purchased a couple of those miniature convex round mirrors and mounted them on both side mirrors which eliminated any fears of changing lanes because of the large B-pillar.  I should include that access to the rear seats could be better but not necessarily a problem.


What is it like to drive this vehicle?

Acceleration and power is strong for a sport utility this size and weight...it weighs about 4000 pounds!  Behind the wheel, the Vehicross has sports car-like personalities which takes off from the start(0-60 in 8.8 seconds) and hugs the road on slalom curves without having that top heavy tipping feeling like in most SUVs. I've yet to take this little monster off road but did drive it through the heavy winter rains and puddles without much difficulty thanks to the sophisticated Torque-On-Demand system which predicts wheel slippage and applies torque accordingly to compensate.  The Vehicross has that solid and tight feel to it while driving on road or off.  The ride itself is firm but not to the point of being jittery.  However, the suspension swallows deep potholes and speed bumps like no other.  Thanks to the specialized shocks and suspension, the Vehicross burns through obstacles that sports cars dare not try.  

As for interacting with the controls of the vehicle, everything seems to be well in reach.  Controls to the air condition/heater/vent and radio are easily readable and use.  The instrumentation in the dash is very legible and multicolored when lit during night driving and can be easily dimmed or brightened to ease the eyes.  The windshield vision is quite wide without distortion and the low sloping hood adds to the road visibility. Also, the engine and wind noise is down to a minimal which I really don't notice because I'm too busy listening to the front-loading 6-disc CD changer that sound really nice for a stock am/fm cassette stereo system.


Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't?

The type of person(s) who should seriously consider purchasing this vehicle are those who are willing to be different and not blend in with the masses.  This Vehicross is just that kind of vehicle that will stand out and come out front from the multitudes of conservative boxy generations of sport utilities.  It is a vehicle that refuses to be classed in with the typical RAV-4's, CRV's, Sidekicks, and even Sportages.  Even the bigger SUVs like the Xterras, Explorers, Pathfinders, Passports, and even Isuzu's Rodeos and Troopers wouldn't be able to match the performance of this spunky truck!

Who shouldn't purchase this limited edition vehicle are the soccer moms and family toting dads.  This is not a family utility truck and isn't made for lugging plywood and such.  Although there is surprisingly amount of cargo space when you fold the rear seats forward to load a couple of mountain bikes.  In fact, during the weekends, I can fit my windsurf board (8'9&quot;long) inside by laying the passenger seat flat and sliding the tail end towards the front passenger leg area along with all my gear and sails in the back.  It's also comfortable enough to be a commuting means of transport.  But, I think this was mostly designed to have fun in the dirt.  However, for those who are not truly convinced in investing in this type of vehicle because of the limited cargo space and not so easy access to the rear seats, Isuzu has announced a 4-door version of the Vehicross (VX-4) to be released to the public either beginning of next year or the year after.  This version would not only have more room and easier access to the rear seats, but also a bigger and more powerful engine than the present 3.5 liter and would include a DVD player, navigational system, and other 'James Bond' accessories.  During the same time, if not sooner, the convertible version (VX-O2) will be available too and looks even cooler and wilder than the present day Vehicross!  Stay tuned!


Also, this truck is not meant to specialize in one certain aspect (like rock climbing...although it can with the appropriate modifications).  Rather, the Vehicross excels in a wide variety of talents that combines the off-road and sports car capabilities in one tight little package!
This vehicle is definitely NOT for those who are shy and are afraid to push their vehicle to the limit on and off road!

However, this vehicle is highly recommended for the artistically-conscious and open-minded individual who appreciates art, design, and engineering accomplishments that result into a textbook example where form follows function and succeeds with awards.<br><br>
