                I turned 5000 miles on the odometer this week(March 02).  Bought the sedan last August(01) because of an ad in a  Chicago newspaper that Friday in August.  The dealer had 3 new 2002's with auto and air advertised for $9495.  That was about $5000(including the rebate) off the list price of about$14500.  Less than many used 2001s! I test drove one and was delighted with the improvements over the red '95 neon I bought new in '94.  I rear ended somebody in June going about 30mph in that one and can vouch for the air bags.  I totaled the '95, but only my thumb was a little sore from the air bag -- I guess.  Anyway I picked silver this time cause I think it looks the most modern and it looks clean even when a little dirty, unlike the dark colors.  The car is extremely easy and fast to hand wash because the body lines are so smooth and the roof is so low.  The big surprise was to find a 4 speed auto trans in it.  I didn,t even see them advertised or reviewed yet with this new trans.  Finally an overdrive for those road trips! The car moves out real good if you full throttle it--sometimes squealing a front tire with the auto trans from a stop and beating a quick path up to the speed limit.  If you're taking it easy the car shifts into overdrive a little above 35mph and holds it fine and makes for lower revs and a engine quieter then the pre 02's on the highway. Of course the full door frames on the later models are a great improvement over my old '95 with no door frames around the windows -- now no air wind leaks at speed. About that auto trans: If you want you can leave it in 3 (instead of D) while on city streets and it changes the responsiveness for more grunt--and engine breaking becomes a usable feature when slowing down. You feel like you're driving a pocket rocket!  
     The front seats are very comfortable, the stock tilt wheel is nice, and there is plenty of legroom.  The console has a nice padded armrest that makes driving a relaxed proposition. The rear seats are plenty usable too, the independent fold-down feature of the back seats is handy when hauling long stuff inserted thru the trunk: at least 7' at an angle into the front passenger area. Good for a little lumber, etc. The trunk is big and deep too so I can put my mountain bike in the trunk and have it partially into the passenger compartment on a nice flat surface and it won't hurt the upholstery cause the seat backs are folded over the seat bottoms.  The cars small, so the a/c cools fast in the summer  and the heater heats quickly even when it's 15 degrees like now in Chicago.  The plastic front is low so you don't want to keep back of parking lot front curbs and you have to go slow down steep driveways meeting a street to keep from hearing it scrape pavement.  The headlights are fantastic.  The Goodyear Eagle GA tires grip very well and the suspension works good to a point.  It will bottom with a jar if you hit a sharp bump at medium speed--like a railroad track that sticks up.  Otherwise it holds the streets with authority on acceleration.  Overall, the car is responsive and handles very good.
