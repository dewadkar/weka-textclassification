            This review might be irrelevant to some of you, because the DeVille I own is a 1973 model. However, if anyone out there is interested in purchasing a really used Cadillac, I offer my advice. 

To be honest, this car really isn't a ridiculous proposition for everyday transportation, as long as gas prices aren't too high in your area. These Cadillacs have lots of V8 power and keep up with modern cars effortlessly. The handling is actually not bad, although the body leans excessively in corners. The steering takes some getting used to, however, because it's so light you can literally twirl the wheel with your finger. It's also very low-geared, so keeping it straight requires a lot of back-and-forth motion, but once you're used to it, you don't even notice you're doing it. The ride is bouncy but very smooth, and the seats feel just like a living-room couch. The view out is nice, too, with no bad blind spots. Parking is actually not much of a hassle because you can easily see all the corners of the car, unlike those rounded new cars. 

The biggest cost, of course, will be gasoline. It requires premium 92 octane, or the engine will sputter and knock. With gas prices rising like they are, it could be a serious financial burden. But these cars are very reliable and simple to repair, so you won't be breaking down all the time. You can do most maintenance/repairs by yourself because the engine compartment is simple and roomy, and any shop can work on it because of the ubiquitous GM drivetrain. 

Overall, this is a pretty easy way to own a classic and stand out on the road. As long as you can afford the gas, I would recommend one of these old land yachts!<br><br>
