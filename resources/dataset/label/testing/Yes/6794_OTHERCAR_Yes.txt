            We own a 1990 hyundai sonata with 170,000+ miles and its still running. This is the best vehicle we have ever owned and the longest we have ever kept a car. We have only had to take it to the repair shop for routine wear and tear items. I've always heard bad things about hyundai reliability and I don't know if we were lucky but its the best i've ever had even though its starting to look a lot rough around the edges. Nothing a new paint job and muffler can't fix. In its category I found it to be the roomiest - especially the back seat. It has plenty trunk space for luggage or groceries. We are very hard on a vehicle and it has with stood all our abuse with no tears in the seats or cracks in the dash - my husband now uses it to go to work and is really killing it and its refusing to die. Through my experience i would highly recommend this car for affordability and reliability.<br><br>
