            Thank goodness I have my truck to use as a backup because after the first time my wife drove my '96 Dodge Intrepid, she fell in love with it!  This car is an easy ride, very comfortable with lots of room inside and a ton of trunk space.  

It's a front wheel drive which makes me feel alot better about her being on snow-covered roads (and here in NW Pennsylvania, there are many opportunities to drive on those *LOL*).

We've taken this car on long trips and it is dependable, has so far been a very low maintenance car and it practically drives itself!  It's got a 6 cylinder motor so it gets good gas mileage.  I'd tell anyone who is in the market for a new car (or a good used one) to definitely think about buying a Dodge Intrepid.<br><br>
