            I will confess, the very first thing that attracted me to the Canon Powershot s100 was the modern, brushed metal design.  I'm an art/design student, I can't help it.  It's no larger than my Visa card (trust me, I pulled it out last night and compared), it's made of the cool stainless-steel that all other Elph cameras are made of, and it has that awesome clean box shape that makes look and feel so sturdy (which it is by the way...very strong &amp; sturdy).  

The one thing that everyone raves about this camera is it's size of course.  It's damn small.  It fits in my pants/shirt pocket so I'm able to take it around with me everywhere.  I mean, what's the point of a camera if you can't take it with you to take the pictures in the first place.  I have a much larger 35mm Minolta SLR, and it's a pain to pack it up, get it ready, and pull it out to take pictures.  No, I'm never going to get rid of my Minolta, but it's also not a camera I can use everyday, everywhere unlike Canon's PowerShot s100.

The picture quality is very good, above average I think.  It has 3 settings, Super-Fine/Large (1600x1200 pixels), Fine/Large (1600x1200 pixels), &amp; Fine/Small (640x480 pixels).  I emailed a friend of mine a picture I took on the lowest setting without telling him that it was the lowest, and he said it was excellent picture quality.  Some people have complained that it only has these 3 settings unlike the s10 which had I believe 6 or 9 more?  Personally I like the simplicity of 3 settings because I don't have to be fiddling around trying to figure out which setting would be best to use, by the time I finally choose, the opportunity for the photograph may already be gone.

Memory wise, the included 8 mb FlashCard is not enough.  I got another 32 mb, and with that, I can take about 21-22 Super-Fine/Large images, 52-54 Fine/Large images, &amp; 190-192 Fine/Small images.  That's pretty much enough for a whole days shooting, but if you wanted to take it on vacation with you, I would suggest a 64 mb.  Unless you had your laptop along, which would allow you to save space on the FlashCard by uploading the images to your laptops hard drive.  Oh, and these FlashCards tend to be a bit steep in price, depending on what brand you get.  64 mb can run you up to over $100.00.  I got my PNY 32 mb card for $69.99, and with the $20.00 rebate they're offering, it'll only really be $49.99.

The color quality of the images are very good, but not great.  I know that the Fuji FinePix 4700 tends to give its pictures far warmer looking colors, as opposed to Canon's Powershot s100 in which they are sometimes (not always) a bit more cooler (bluish) depending on the lighting condition in which the photo was taken.  Perhaps I notice this because I'm an art student, but even so, it does not take away from the overall quality of the photographs.  Also something I've noticed with images taken in dim light conditions, flat colored surfaces tend to have some noise.  Again, I noticed it because an art student tends to notice stuff like that.

Some other good things about the camera though are the features that will help you to have great pictures.  You have some control over the exposure compensation (from a -2 step to a +2 step, it also allows you to set the white balance (from Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Tungsten, &amp; Fluorescent).  Another great feature is the Stitch Assist Mode which help you compose images that can be later combined to a panorama (up to a 360 view) with the included software.

Overall, it's a damn cool digital camera.  I take it everywhere with me.  I put it in a protective bag I got with my sunglasses to keep the LCD screen safe because it's the one thing that isn't sold with the camera, a protective case.  The battery that comes with it is rechargeable and it only takes about 2 hours to fully charge.  It takes great photos that are excellent in quality.<br><br>
