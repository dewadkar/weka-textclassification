            I am the proud owner of a hunter green 1995 Hyundai Accent. Yes, I used the word &quot;proud&quot;! I purchased a 4 door Accent with a standard transmission  in October of 1995 and, to date, have had *no* problems with it. I am a longtime Hyundai driver (my first and second cars were Excels). After exploring the possibility of purchasing a Saturn or Geo (comparably priced at the time of purchase), I chose the Accent for its affordability and reliable performance. I did use the financing package offered by the dealership (Chrysler Credit), which has been a mixed bag at best -- but I digress. 
My car handles well in all sorts of weather, starts in subzero temperatures, and gets good gas mileage (roughly 25 miles per gallon). This car is light enough to climb over 6 inches of snow (a definite plus for winters in New England!). Minor repairs have been necessary -- replacing windshield wipers, fixing windshield &quot;dings&quot;, re-attaching the cup holder -- but repair costs have been decidedly minimal. I enjoy long-distance trips, and have taken this car across the country with ease.Since I purchased the 4 door model, I do not find the car to be cramped (and yes, I have been in the back seat).
I would recommend this car without hesitation for auto buyers who want the advantages of a new car without dying of &quot;sticker shock&quot;. My only qualifications to the above statement are the following:
1) I hesitate to recommend the heating/cooling system in rainy weather -- I find that I have to crank the heat/a.c. in order to see the road. Friends who are Hyundai owners make the same claim.
2) As I test drove the car, my overly chipper sales representative tried to steer me toward an Elantra, claiming that I &quot;would lose $3,000 in resale value the minute I drove the Accent off the lot&quot;. The current book value of my car is $4975 (source: Kelley Blue Book http://www.kbb.com. Clearly, I bought this car to drive it, not for its resale value. 
3) A small complaint -- the rear seats don't fold down to give cabin access to the trunk. This sounds petty until you try to transport anything large (furniture) while owning this car. I think that some models might have this option -- but mine doesn't.
