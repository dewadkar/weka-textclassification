            We purchased this vehicle after owning a pathfinder for 4 years. Was not happy with the pathfinder but I do love my Cherokee Laredo!! It's so comfortable and in my opinion, extremely roomy.  The cloth seats are the most comfortable car seats that I have ever sat in.   The ride is smooth and has stayed that way for the three years that we have owned it so far.  We also own a mini van, but this car by far is my favorite to one to drive.  You will like this vehicle if you like to feel in control of the road and like to feel safe while you're driving. At least I do.<br><br>
