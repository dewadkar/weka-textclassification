            I should preface this review by saying that (1)it is based on initial impressions gained from 1200mi driving including one 700 mi road trip and one short (2 mile) trip on a really nasty dirt road and (2) I was able to get an SE for $24,000 after a $3500 rebate (end of year).  I would be less enthusiastic if I had paid $27,500, though still happy.

Inside:
I have been pleasantly surprised by the Freelander.  Having read several professional reviews that criticized the ergonomics I was prepared to be disappointed, however I have found many of the complaints to be without basis.  The gauges are a bit on the small side, but this becomes less of an issue as one becomes familiar with them.  The seating was very comfortable (for me) both for daily commuting and a long road trip, but is more upright/chair like than others-(try before you buy).  Cabin noise is restrained and remarkably quiet for this class of vehicle.  I found the dash-mounted cup holders to be just fine and concerns over spillage(?) unfounded.  The door cup holders are very cool as they can hold large water bottles.  The numerous storage bins on the dash area, while smallish, all contain a removable rubber insert and hold odds and ends great.  The glove boxes are also on the small side but there are two of them.  There is also a center console storage area where the armrest should be (ahem-more on this later). The door-mounted bins are larger than average.  Rear-seating is "stadium-like" and affords passengers a comfortable ride and great view.  There are two ceiling mounted storage bins (nets) for small items in the rear as well.  The rear seats easily fold down to enlarge the small cargo area in back.  While you&#146re not going to slide a full-size sheet of plywood in back, the cargo area is more than adequate for most purposes.

The overall feeling inside is not one of enveloping luxury (except for the leather seats-which are quite nice) but it stood up to three adult humans two adult English bulldogs for 350 miles and then cleaned up easily.  I guess that's good enough for me.  Heated windshield is great if you live anywhere it snows (I do), but is of less value otherwise-probably should be an option with heated seats.  ARMREST WOULD BE NICE!  I bought one online, which actually turned out to be great, but cost another $120.00

Outside:
The vehicle handles extremely well on the road (I also have a Miata and an RSX-S, so it's relative-but very good).  Though the engine doesn't blast you off the line I have found it to be smooth with the power for passing present when needed.  On a very rough, rutted dirt road containing ice/snow/mud at various points plus a couple of shallow washouts, the Freelander was unflappable and lent great confidence to the driver.  Most surprising was how well the suspension handled the road, keeping the Freelander's occupants (myself and my wife) from otherwise having their "brains scrambled" (as has happened to me in a Forester on this same road when it was in better shape!).  Styling is of course a matter of personal taste, but I like the Freelander styling better than that of the competition (mind you this was not a deciding factor in my buy/no buy decision).

Avg. Mileage 19.8mpg, low 18.9mpg, high 20.5 mpg
Problems: none-so far.  Note door speakers will rattle if bass is maxed, but since I'm not into irritating the whole neighborhood with THUMP THUMP THUMP, this is not an issue.  Otherwise stock stereo is decent.

Finally-I'll have to admit that having a "Land Rover" is pretty cool!
