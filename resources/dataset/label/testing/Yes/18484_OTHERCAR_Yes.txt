            This is a classic truck. Though it is small in size, it more than makes up for it in power. Being an eight cylinder truck, the gas mileage leaves something to be desired. My biggest complaint is that the radiator doesn't have the best design. It works, but it will gradually break down, and eventually leak. I do love this truck, though. Despite it's size it will pull pound for pound anything a full-sized truck will. It's also fun to leave those huge dually trucks lonely at the line! If you need a fun, reliable work-horse truck, this is the truck for you. If you have a long daily commute, look somewhere else.<br><br>
