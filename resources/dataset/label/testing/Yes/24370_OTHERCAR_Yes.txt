            Some say that this 2 year old camera is compromised because it neither takes good digital pictures NOR does it take lengthy movies. I think one needs to limit his/her expectations and that this is still an excellent product. 

I purchased this wonder unit 2 years ago since I was about to become a new father. I always considered a camcorder too cumbersome and wanted something that could very quickly capture special moments of my son's life. Something more real-time would be required. After recording these pictures or movies, I wanted to be able to very simply transfer these data files to my computer and email them to family/friends. Well, I can do all of that with the DSC-F55. 

Nevertheless, like others have mentioned here already, this product is not perfect. In fact, SONY has already discontinued this model with the P & S series. Despite the Carl Z lens in this model, the digital pictures seem to be some 5% less sharp when compared to those produced by friends using Kodak or Olympus or Canon or Nikon cameras. I read that SONY uses more compression in their digital pictures and this does show sometimes. The movies are sized at a decent 320 X 240 resolution, but you are limited to 5/10/15 second fixed clips. I believe the camera caches data from each movie taken and then takes 2-3 seconds to write to the memory card before you can reshoot a second clip. I would say this time gap problem will cause you to lose about 1/10th of your clips. Oh well, cant have everything.

I am assuming you are reading this review now because you have a chance at purchasing a used, refurbed or clearance unit. I would say take it if you are given a price of US$400 or less. SONY still remains the champ in this dual purpose digicam category. I think the S85 is now taking top spot in the SONY line and it also allows continuous movie recording in lower resolutions.

If you want to see some samples of pictures & movie clips from the DSC-F55 before buying it, come and visit my homepage at: http://www.mrkao.com. Movie samples are in the BABY MOVIES section.
