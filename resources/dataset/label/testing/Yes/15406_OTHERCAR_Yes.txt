            I really like this camera.  It's very functional and easy to use.  You have lots of options that you can choose from. You can change the resolution from 320x240 to 1024x786.  I have mixed feelings about the floppy storage though, because on one hand you've got the price and ease of use of the floppy's but then on the other hand floppys are known to have lots of errors and don't last very long. they are much bigger than Flash memory, and hold less. so i think it would be better if it used compact flash memory.  So in short, this would be a good first digital camera, and good for all uses except photos that you just gotta have because floppys are unreliable<br><br>
