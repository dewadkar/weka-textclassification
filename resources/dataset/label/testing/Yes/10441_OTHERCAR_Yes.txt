            My Integra coupe hatchback is easily the best car I have ever owned (UPDATE 12/20/02: That was true at the time, but see my review for the 1992 Lexus SC300 to see why I like the Lexus even more).  Okay, yes, the back seat is extremely small, but you CAN actually put people in it, unlike the Mitsubishi Eclipse.  The rear split seats also fold down to make more cargo room in the trunk, and the rear shelf comes out easily for still more room.  Even without either of these adjustments, it still carries my golf clubs with plenty of room left over for groceries.

First I'll address the one main design flaw with this model year: the factory radiator, while metal, has a plastic overflow tank with internal metal heat dissipators.  Yep.  Plastic.  Well, I bought this car used, but in 1999 (the model year is 1995), I had to have the radiator replaced.  Anything plastic in a radiator is just not durable, and even my mechanic can't figure out why they did it like that.  A metal one wasn't available for the car at that time, so another plastic one was put in.  Just recently (2001) I had to have it replaced AGAIN.  Anyway, an all-metal radiator is available for the car now, so I have one.  And no, my mechanic isn't a con artist.  :)

Now to the good parts:

This car looks and feels much more expensive than it is.  It has Honda's reliability and great craftsmanship (it's basically a Honda underneath), but is considerably more comfortable than the Civic.  I have the base model, the RS, and even so it's much zippier than you expect at about 130 horsepower.  Lots of torque and passing power (I have a manual).  In my experiences it drives comparably to the 1999 Mazda Miata but is slightly heavier.  I bought it used in 1998 for about $13,000 (fleet price).

I'm very short (5'1") and I found this car unexpectedly comfortable to sit in.  Everything adjusts pretty well to let me reach the pedals easily and yet be a good distance from the windshield and steering wheel.  The driver's seat has a lumbar adjustment.  The car rides low, and you sit low in it, which takes some getting used to if you haven't owned a small car before (and it's why everybody driving one seems to be about 3 feet tall).

I recommend getting some high performance tires, since regular touring tires are not sufficiently grippy on pavement if you intend to drive this car even reasonably aggressively (because of the high torque).  I bought Yokohama AVS Intermediates, which are summer tires that have good rain performance.  With normal driving I found turns to be much more secure, and it leaves you with a greater feeling of safety that the car will handle well in an emergency.

Steering and braking are very predictable; no sudden surprises.  Gives an exceptionally good ride for a small car, and the interior noise is also very low for a sports car.

Overall an outstanding car, possibly one of the best ever made.  I will definitely buy an Acura again, though maybe a bigger one next time!

Update 9/3/02: In April of this year, this car was totalled in an accident.  I was struck from behind by a Toyota Avalon -- he had been struck by a Jeep Cherokee going about 70mph.  I hit a van in front of me.  We were all stopped at the time.

I was not injured except for a slightly dislocated big toe.  I must say the car took the hit impressively well, and protected me perfectly.  Estimate to repair the vehicle was about $7,000 (buckled and torn floor in the rear trunk area, possible frame damage, front bashed in nicely). Since the value of the car at the time was only about $7,500, it was considered a total loss.

So, a safe car, too!
