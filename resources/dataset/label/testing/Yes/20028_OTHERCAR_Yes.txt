            The Dodge Omni was my first car.  While I would never buy another, it is only because they will be too old by the time my wife and I have teens.  It is now difficult to find one that is still in good condition.  If you do, buy it.  

For the price, $200 dollars in 1991 for a 1981 Omni with a blown head gasket, the Omni is an excellent value.  With help from my father the head gasket cost $26 dollars to fix.  (Although, my father is an auto mechanic.)  

While Chrysler now has an excellent radio the ones in the 1981 Omni left a lot to be desired; as did the speakers.  I put over $100 into a new radio and speakers.  

The reason the car is good for teen is that it handles surprisingly well, but never gets surprisingly fast.  I don't think the things will go over 100mph and except down hill they are difficult to get to 85mph which is where the speedometer tops out.  The are comfortable enough to drive around town and to school.  Even a trip a of a an hour or two was comfortable enough.  <br><br>
