            Many digital cameras are big and bulky, but not the DC4800.  It is hard to tell at first glance this camera is not a 35mm.  The outside case is aluminum and weighs about 11 ounces without the battery and fits nicely in any camera case.  Plus, you can begin using it after 4 hours (average battery charge) out of the box.

The DC4800 comes with a strap which is a bit cumbersome and tough to connect at first.  The lens cap has no attachment cord which doesn't make sense, but I guess you can't have everything.  The 16MB CompactFlash is enough for 15 pictures in default mode, and about 40 in compressed mode.  If you charge the Lithium Ion battery (that comes with the camera) in the camera itself, it takes approximately 4 hours, which might be a problem if you are on vacation and such.  If you use the camera a lot or away from a plug, an extra battery pack would be useful with an external charger which charges in approximately 1 hour. 

With the DC4800 you can control white balance, use color filters, shoot at many resolution and quality settings, use sharpness filters, select ISO values, use automatic and manual shutter speed and f-stop settings, and use 6X zoom (3X optical and 2X digital). Plus, there are options B/W yellow filter, B/W red filter, B/W, sepia mode, neutral mode, saturated mode, and burst( which allows you to shoot in sequence outdoors), all great fun!

When you register the camera with Kodak, they will send you a free lens attachment, which made product registration worthwhile ($24.99 value).  Be sure to download the Firmware update before using the camera, it takes care of some bugs in the camera that make the upgrade a worthwhile pursuit.  The upgrade process is quite simple and fast.

The software CD contains the necessary drivers that shows the camera as a removable storage device and lets you manage your photos in a number of ways and format the flash picture card.  Other than that, the software CD is worthless.  Hopefully you already have some type of Image editing software, because this CD doesn't have it.  The Kodak web site offers free registration for photo sharing and such, plus basic editing tools, so it's worth checking out (or try http://www.shutterfly.com for something similar)

Until April 30, 2001, Kodak has a $100 rebate on this camera or you can opt for an extra battery with charger and another 16MB CompactFlash.  If you don't need the cash, then grab the extra battery package, it will be worth it.

Enjoy the new camera!
