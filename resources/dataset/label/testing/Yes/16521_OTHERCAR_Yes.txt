            I had owned an old Jetta in the past and decided I wanted another VW.  As I am not a fan of hatchbacks, the Golf was not an option.  Just out of college the Passat seemed a bit pricier than I could afford.  So I got another Jetta that I LOVE!!!  I bought my 1996 Jetta GL standard with 37,500 miles and have driven it about 13,000 in the last 8 months without any problems.  

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR

Though some would say that Jettas are made for tiny people, I beg to differ.  I find that they are very roomy and even my husband, who is 6'3&quot;, 210 lbs, can get comfortable.  The trunk space is unbelievably large and I have moved several large pieces of furniture with no problems.  I also like the way the back seat flips down on this model to allow for long items to fit in the car. 
The heat works great and very fast which is important on cold New England mornings!  Though I did have a lot of problems in my older Jetta (1988 GL model) with the blower motor breaking, this car has given me no signs of any electrical difficulty as many a VW have been guilty of in the past.  
The standard security system is easy to use, to lock all the doors of the car, simply lock the drivers side door from the outside and a &quot;beep&quot; will alarm indicating that the alarm is activated.  One turn in the opposite direction unlocks the driver door, while two consecutive turns unlocks all doors at once as well as the gas tank.  My car also has an unlock and lock button for all the doors inside the car as well.  
There is a small storage compartment immediately right behind the e-brake where the trunk pop button is also located.  And there is more storage directly under the ashtray area with two cup holders, that, I must admit, one can only fit small drinks into.  Lastly, there is storage on all of bottoms of the doors, which is convenient for little items such as tapes or change.
This car drives quietly despite the usual VW hummmm that all VW seem to possess no matter what their age. 
The radio/cassette player that came with my car was the premium sound system (standard on this model I believe) and it works great, and I have had no problems with reception or playing tapes.  
 

WHAT THIS CAR IS LACKING
I do not think  these cars lack much, except maybe smoother sliding box seats.  The ones in my car seem to stick quite a bit even after oiling.  The glove compartment (lucky to have one because some earlier models do not) is not located in a convenient area.  It flips down and is quite small, making it hard in which to store miscellaneous items.

OVERALL
I think this is a great car if you love VW.  It has a classy exterior and an interior to match.  Some of the ergonomics on the inside of the car could be improved but it suits the average driver fine.  I have had no difficulties under the hood with these vehicle, and it gets great gas mileage.<br><br>
