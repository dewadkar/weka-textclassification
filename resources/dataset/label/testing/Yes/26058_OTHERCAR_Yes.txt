            1999 Mazda Protege ES
1.8L DOHC 4-cyl
5-spd manual transmission
Classic Red
79,000 miles at time of review
Bought new in February 1999

I bought my Protege to replace a 1982 RX-7 as a primary vehicle. I wanted something sporty, good looking, roomy, and under $20,000. After looking at the Protege, I knew I found the right vehicle and it was well under my price cap.

The chassis is rock solid. It doesn't quiver and vibrate over speed bumps and road imperfections. You don't see or feel the body flex or shake. This is a problem with many economy cars out there.

The front seats are roomy and have a generous amount of seat travel. The seats are wide and firm, yet very comfortable. I have sat in them for long 500  mile trips and have slept in them at rest stops. I even thought about buying a Protege seat and having a chair made out of one! The rear seats are roomy and comfortable for two people. Three people can be easily carried, but the comfort level goes drastically down. There is plenty of space under the front seats for toes. Headroom is adequate but not generous in the rear.

The Protege's styling seems to be inspired from European sedans with its upright character. Lines are crisp and well defined, while panels in between curve ever so slightly. The alloy wheels are an excellent match for the body, although they look small (15"). The interior is straightforward with many shades of gray and black. Ergonomics are excellent. The trunk is generously sized with very little intrusions into it. The trunk opening is tall and wide, from the top of the bumper to the rear glass. The 60/40 rear seats fold down nearly flat and the opening into the truck is wide and tall.

The 1.8L engine is smooth from idle to redline. Torque is adequate below 3,000rpm and excellent from 3,000rpm to redline. The engine is generally quiet under 3,500rpm but emits quite a growl above that. There is a slight power burst at 3,800rpm and power does not drop off as it approaches redline. The manual transmission is precise with positive engagement (you can feel in and out of each gear, no guessing), but it could be a bit smoother during fast shifts. The clutch engages almost immediately off the floor, so a little throttle is necessary before letting up on the clutch. It is set up for quick launches at the expense of a smooth start without having to slip the clutch a lot.

The suspension is tuned for handling. Body roll is abundant but very well controlled. The Protege tackles corners just as well as some sports cars. Understeer is noticed only in the hardest corners; the car remains very neutral most of the time. 

The ride is firm, bordering on stiff especially at low speeds. Small bumps are felt, but large bumps and potholes don't crash through the interior either. As speed increases, the ride gets smoother and more comfortable. At 80mph, the ride is very well controlled but smooth. At 100  mph (for those who want to know), the ride is still quite stable and there is no loss of control.

The rack and pinion steering has variable assist dependant on engine speed. In parking lots, the steering is light and easy; on the freeway, the steering is stiff and very precise. You can feel what the front tires are doing through the steering wheel but bumps are generally not felt.

The brakes are powerful, even with rear drums. I don't have ABS, but the car stops straight in panic stops. There is very little nose-dive when the brakes are applied.

Overall, the car is a blast to drive hard. It also provides a lot of interior and trunk space. I have been surprised what I can carry in it... I have put a bookcase in it with a dresser. I can carry about twenty 2x4x8's and even some 10' lengths.

On the down side, the ride while travelling slow is very stiff. This is a trade-off for the excellent handling, so the driver is usually not bothered by it. Passengers, on the other hand, may find it rather annoying. Another downfall is sound insulation. Although wind noise is very well controlled, road and tire noise is very noticeable. Tires make a big difference in this car, not just for handling, but for noise levels as well.

The car has been fairly trouble-free except for a CD player with a mind of its own, a squeaky front suspension, and rear door seals that like to come out of their track. The original brake pads, although powerful, only lasted about 25,000 miles. The Midas brake pads on there now have lasted over twice as long.

If I could make changes, I would add a lot of sound insulation to the floor and around the wheel wells. I would also add a real armrest, since the one in there is too far back to rest anything but your elbow on. If there are cups in the cupholders, you can't access the ash tray or lighter. Also, the gearing could be a bit higher to lower engine rpm on the freeway (4,000 rpm at 80 mph) and probably improve gas mileage (I average 29-31 mpg on the freeway). But, for $14,800, I can't complain. I got BMW dynamics, Japanese quality and reliability, and European styling. Too bad I also got Korean resale.
