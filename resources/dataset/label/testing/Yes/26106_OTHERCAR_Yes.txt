            January 2002 update...

This camera is still working great with absolutely no problems.  It is used by several departments here at work and is constantly used.  We still are using the original batteries and they keep a good charge.  I might suggest getting an additional memory card, although we haven't yet.

This camera was purchase for work (government) without a heck of a lot of research.  It was the only camera available on State Contract at the time, but it seems like we lucked out.

I do a lot of presentations and camera work for a local government.  This camera is used on a daily basis, not only by me, but others who claim to be camera illiterate.  

It is taken to work sites by our Engineers in all sorts of weather.  The Town Engineer dropped it in the mud which covered the main controls.  We wiped it off.  The dials grinded a bit at first. 6 months later, however, there are no signs of this accident.

The camera has taken some great photos, but sometimes in low light setting, the flash isn't very powerful.  It appears to be good only for short range (6 feet).

Some people who use the camera seem to mistakenly push the button that changes the picture settings when they try to take a picture.  This button controls the resolution and color vs. black and white.

I have made enlargements with photos taken at the highest resolution.  I have a HP Deskjet 1120C and use photo quality paper.  An 8 X 10 looks great.

You can create panoramic photos by taken multiple pictures and "stitch" them together using the program that comes with the camera.  It's a fun little feature and works well.
