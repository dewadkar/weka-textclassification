            I purchased this car in August as a combo Anniversary/Birthday gift for my wife who is expecting.  I got a great quote from Cars Direct, but they couldn't get me the car in time, so I negotiated using their price with a local dealer.  After much research and many test drives, I decided on the SE model with the 4-cylinder automatic.  The V-6 seemed too busy with a lack of low-end torque up hills, downshifting and revving high without a good kick.  I drove the 4-cylinder for comparison and was pleasantly surprised.  The automatic works well with the 4-cylinder, shifting at the optimum points on the torque curve to really scoot the car along well.

With this info, I could not rationalize paying over $1000 more for the V-6, especially when it gets significantly lower gas mileage.  Also, in general fours are more reliable and less expensive to maintain.  The only bummer is that you get stuck with rear drum brakes and no ABS with the four.  Also, no Sportmatic transmission, which is a fun feature.

The main feature my wife wanted in a car was the power moonroof.  She got it with the SE (standard!) and is quite pleased with the power everything, remote keyless entry, chrome door handles and handsome styling of the car.  She thinks it looks like a BMW or Mercedes!  It is quite a step up from her 1993 Nissan Sentra E model 2-door, with power nothing and no A/C! (But the Nissan ran like a top without ever needing a repair!!!)  Her only gripe is the wood trim, which does nothing for her, and the lack of rear-seat lighting.  The rear is definitely too dark at night.  

We took a road trip from Connecticut to Cape Breton in this car, fully loaded with baby gear and 2 bikes on a rack.  It strained on the Canadian fast highways climbing hills, but was otherwise a great handling and reliable car.  Manually downshifted it is sporty and handles great in mountain curves!
