            My current car, a 1995 Ford Taurus GL is the second Taurus I have owned.  I only sold my last car, a 1987 Taurus LX two years ago.

I absolutely love this vehicle.  The car is solid, quiet and has an outstandingly smooth ride.  Add to those qualities roominess and comfort, and all of the bells and whistles right at my fingertips.

I don't really place any one type of driver with the Taurus.  While it appears to be a mid-sized family sedan, I am a single, never married professional who uses this car every day.  I find that it has all of the power to suit my needs, either in city or highway driving, and handles perfectly.

While I have purchased my current car used (it had only 25,000 miles on it), I did have the opportunity to drive the 2000 Taurus SE this week, and I am glad to say that Ford hasn't goofed up a perfect car.  In fact, I can honestly say that I would purchase any of the new Tauruses, although, I cannot part with my 1995.
