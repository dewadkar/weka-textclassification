            I am an owner of a 2001 3- door coupe. Having owned 4 other brands of cars over the past 20 years, I was hesitant because the body sides moved in when I pushed them and I was worried that this meant that I would be killed in an accident.  Was I wrong ! After seeing the inside of the doors at the dealership I found that they are triple reinforced!  The car is beautiful to look at and gets great gas mileage. I thought I would hate the third door but, in fact, love it!  

I do have some problems with the body side runners because they are very thick and stay wet after the car is dry..when you open the door you get your pants wet as they brush on them.  The car runs very well and has smooth acceleration.

Best of all is that the service people are fantastic.  The no haggle price was wonderful and they gave me a free oil change because I had to wait a whole 15 minutes after the car was promised. They called to see how I was doing and had a dinner meeting to show how the car works inside and out.

Buy this car if you want reliability BUT if you are a large person you will not find it comfortable and may need the new 4 door.<br><br>
