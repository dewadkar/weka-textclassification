As a mother of three young children, and an avid scrapbooker, I take a lot of photographs.  While not uncomfortable behind the camera, it has often been irritating and discouraging to have film developed only to find that those &quot;perfect&quot; pictures I've been waiting for aren't so perfect after all!
The Olympus D-340 R has changed all that!  We received this excellent camera as a Christmas gift and I was quite leery of the technology at first.  Afraid of using it incorrectly, damaging it in some way or simply not being patient enough to wade through all the technical &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot;, I let my husband take over the photographic duties and watched from the sidelines.
One afternoon, however, as I watched my children playing with some friends, my youngest child, a very late walker, decided to take her first steps!  Desperate not to lose the moment, I grabbed the nearest camera at hand, the digital, and began snapping away!  There were no technological hoops to jump through, no multiple-step programming hold-ups:  just point and shoot.
The best part is, I can see how the picture looks while I am framing it!  No more guesswork.  No more expecting terrific photos only to receive out-of-focus, underexposed prints.  And if I don't get exactly the shot I want, I know immediately and can set right up for another.
One drawback to this camera is the touch sensitivity of the button.  On several occasions, I have pressed too lightly, thought I have captured the image, then found the picture was not taken.
The camera holds over 120 photographs on the chip.  The software is both easy to use and easy to install.  Photographic files do take up a bit of space on the hard drive; I recommend that those who have limited storage capacity invest in a zip drive to permanently store their photos.
