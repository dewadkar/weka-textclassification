            And I swore I would never buy another Nissan. After driving an '89 240sx forever, the head gasket finally blew for the last time! Although fun to drive, spending another $1000 on a rust invested high milage car, made me want to puke. So in search of a Ranger, or S-10, I figured I would drive A Frontier to compare. I said I would never buy another Nissan, but I ended up driving the truck and was instantly astounded by the superior feel compared to it's american counter-parts. Just felt like a well-built machine. I do a lot of driving, but I still wanted a truck, and with the nice interior and quiet-ride, I was sold on the Frontier. Only complaint is the retardedly low suspension, but maybe someday I'll have it lifted a couple inches and add bigger tires. Not much of an extended cab, but I am a single college guy, who cares about seating room when all your friends are drunk? After-market cruise was a necesity, but that's about it. I got my truck box, bedliner, and tinted windows. Sporty, yet Red-neckish at the same time. Ok, well just thought I'd say I feel that it's a decent truck, and have no major complaints. But if you're looking at used cars, Stay away from the 89 240sx!
