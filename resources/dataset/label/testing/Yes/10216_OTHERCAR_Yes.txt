            My wife and I went looking for a SUV in the spring.  We purchased the Lexus in May.  Our other car is a BMW convertible.  Since we live in a relatively warm area, southern Virginia, we wanted to forgo the 4WD version for a 2WD (Front) version instead.  It saved us money on a feature that I had almost never used on a previous SUV.

We looked at the Lexus, Toyota 4Runner, Explorer and MB.  The MB was more than we wanted to spend and the sole dealer in the area sells only at list price.  We chose the Lexus because of it's roominess, style, safety features, ride and overall value.  It had a better warranty than the 4Runner, rode much better than the Explorer, and had the easiest ease of entry for rear seat passengers.

We paid $30,501 for the 2WD version, cloth seats and no CD player.  Just your basic vehicle but the base Lexus comes pretty well loaded.  So far no regrets about the CD player but we wonder if the leather might wear better in a few years.  The drive and handling is car-like and exceptional except for a terrible turning radius.  U-turns are very tricky at stop lights, and sometimes it is hard to get into a parking spot at the mall on the first pass.  My neighbor has a Lexus and complains about the same thing.  We hope they fix this in future models.  Long trips in the car are a pleasure.  The cockpit noise is minimal, and the suspension smooth.  The A/C is one of the best I have ever encountered, very powerful.  The climate control takes a little time to get used to.  And, it always seems to turn the Air Conditioner on when you activate it, even if you set the temperature to one that is warmer than the outside air.  Little quirk.

The overall interior trim is excellent.  The wood finish is high quality. Nothing has rattled or squeaked at all.  The exterior finish is also high quality EXCEPT for the rear bumper.  The paint on it is paper thin.  If you place objects on the bumper while you are loading and unloading the rear you will scratch the paint off.  This happened 1 week after we had the car.  We brought this to the attention of the repair people and they said that it was a problem they knew of, and we had to buy the touch-up paint for the bumper.  I thought that stunk.

The car has had no warranty related problems so far.  The service people have been pretty good overall, but the 10,000 mile service was almost $200.00.   This is pretty much in line with other luxury makes we have had.

Apart from those relatively minor quibbles, were are exceptionally happy with our purchase.<br><br>
