            <b>Intro</b>... I bought this at...

I bought this at a local store for around 800 dollars.  After the taxes and warranty it came to about 950 dollars, so just expect that price hike.  I  was not sure if I should buy it, because after all, it was the most expensive thing there.  After about an hour of looking and debating I decided I would buy it, and that I could always bring it back if I wanted, which is what I actually ended up doing.

<b>What I Liked</b>... The list keeps going, and going and..

The first thing I really liked was that it had 5 mega pixles.  That is like the best quality out there.  I was not really sure if I needed this much though, I mean my printer can't even print that high of a quality.  It also has alot of features such as flash adjustments, multiple movie modes, shutter speed selection.  It also has digital effect such as solaire, sepia, ect.  It has lots of zoom too and its from a brandname you can trust, Sony.  It has a 1.8" screen, which may sound small but is plenty big for anyone who can see clearly.  It also uses lion batteries which last much longer than the NIMH batteries that other cameras use.  It uses sony Memory Sticks, one of the most expensive kind of storage, but not by a lot.  A 128 mb stick is about 80 dollars, but it is reusable.  You can hold a little bit more than 50 pictures at the highest quality on the 128 mb card.  On the lowest quality you can hold about 800 pictures.  I preffer something in the middle that holds like 250 pictures, that quality is plenty for me, I just make it better if its a special picture, or something I would want to make bigger.

<b>What I Didn't Like</b>...  Do you REALLY need it?

Although this is an absolutely wonderful camera, and it is worth the 800 dollars, is it really something you should put such an invesment in?  I would not recommend this for the average person because it is <b>NOT</b> a pocket camera.  I would only recommend this for somebody who wants to get into photography, and who makes pictures bigger than 8x10" (normal paper).

<b>My Final Epinion</b>..An excellent camera, too excellent.

Overall I would not recommend this camera to the average picture taking on vacation person.  It is too big and it is definantly not a pocket camera.  I would recommend this to a photographer, or someone who is really into photography.  I would recommend that the average person goes with a 2 or 3 megapixle camera, unless you plan on sending the pictures to get blown up, than you should get a 4 or 5 mega pixle camera.  After a week I returned the camera and got a 2 megapixle olympus camedia camera.

Thankyou for reading my review.
