            The Nissan 300zx is a awsome piece of engineering!  I bought one with only 70000kms on it and it ran like a new car.  For a 10 year old car they hold their resale value very high especially in my area since they are very rare.  

Simply put the level of refinement is excellent, this car is much nice than any camaro or mustang I have driven or ridden in.  While the NA version is not a torqe monster, she really carves corners like a dream, you can push the car really hard and it handles with easy - as long as your not on wet roads.

The cockpit is layed out very well, some design went into this, the controls are all with in the driver's reach with out having to look around, can almost feel your way around the controls without having to take your eyes off the road.  

The car is very reliable.  The only complaint I have about the car is its expensive to buy and to maintain, but I guess thats expected from a sports car.  Its also not the most fuel efficient car but who cares when your driving a ride as nice as this.
