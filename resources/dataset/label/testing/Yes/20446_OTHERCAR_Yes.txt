            I fell in love with the first time I saw this car! It's stylish, very comfortable, and handles like no other car I've ever owned. I have never felt so comfortable as well as safe in a car. I recently had been in a car wreck and I was a little uncomfortable about driving the way I use to, confidently, but since I got my Jetta I'm driving more assertively than before. The Jetta handling is very stable, and the steering wheel is tight, making it easier to make sharper turns. The acceleration is wonderful, living in Houston there are many times I need to zip onto the highway. With the Jetta, that is never a problem.

I was able to get a great deal on my car, with sunroof, alloy wheels and 6 cd changer. I was thrilled to be offered these packages that can normally be quite costly. I bought my Jetta from Momentum in Houston, Tx. I must say that the salesman who helped us was extremely friendly. Also they offer a great warranty package which includes bumper to bumper and even corrosion damage. There are a few other warranties that I cannot remember as of now. There were so many added features to my Jetta it is hard to remember everything!

I was very impressed with the size of the trunk in the Jetta. My uncle, who is very hard to please, was even commenting on it. I have had to stuff all kinds of things in it, and it all fit! Another great feature is the keyless remote as well as the alarm system, which is not as loud and obnoxious as many alarm systems can be. The alarm sound is low, though still audible so that you can still hear it far away. It does not go off if someone just bumps into your car, which is nice.

The first time I got into the Jetta I test drove I noticed something different, something that varied from my past cars. When I got out after the test drive I noticed what it was. The car was sitting higher of the ground and it was much easier to get out of. Other great features included on all models of the Jetta are air and odor filters, front and side airbags for front seat passengers, fog lights, vanity lights, and lights on both sides in the back for nighttime readers or those who just need to have a light on. With these lights, someone in the back can have a light on and not have it bother the driver.


One of the only bad things that I have noticed so far about this car is that the gas mileage isn't the greatest. Recently I've been getting about 265 miles to the tank, which is about 15 gallons. This car is for anyone who doesn't plan on carrying an entire family around all the time. The back seat is way too small to have people travelling back there on a regular basis. 

It is really great for single people and couples, I highly recommend it for college students. Its a fun appealing car that is easy to get in and out of. No wonder it was rated Most Appealing Mid Size car in its class by J. D. Powers and associates!<br><br>
