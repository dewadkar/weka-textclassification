            You probably know about all the features- the tricky third row fold-flat seat, the easily removable second row seats, the automatic sliding doors- so I'll tell you about the ownership experience rather than reciting the owner's manual.

The second row seats are the BEST.  I'm six foot one and 250#, so I am a little bit demanding about seating.  The second row is GREAT.  The seats move forwards or backwards and recline quite far back.  All three rows recline, in fact, although you have to get out of the third row to recline it.  The third row and the first row are a teensy bit short on legroom, but this is true of all minivans.  The third row passengers get enough legroom if the second row passengers are shorter than me.  However, the front row, especially the right front, could use an inch more legroom even when the seat is all the way back.

Engine power feels great, handling is very carlike, visibility is great.  The noise level is higher than in some of the competition (Sienna, Grand Caravan) but is acceptable.  In fact, a little wind and road noise may be preferable to hearing siblings bicker.

Of course it's a Honda, so all the switches, knobs, bins, etc. are perfect.  Although, I must say, I wish there was a little trash can.  I filled up the most trash-can-like bin with CD's.  Still, I'd rather have the Honda's "fold down-walk through" tray in the front row than a big console, even if it had a trash can in it.

I've owned this for over a year and I LOVE IT.  Perfect for a family with 2 or more kids. For that matter, 6 adults could ride VERY comfortably in this for hours.  And it's so cargo-capable that I sold my pickup truck!
