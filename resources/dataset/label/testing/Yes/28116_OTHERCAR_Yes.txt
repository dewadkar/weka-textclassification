            The Polaroid PDC-700, priced around $220.00 is a great value for those seeking a digital camera for auctions and websites.  This digital camera operates on four AA batteries or the included AC adapter.  I always use the AC adapter with this digital camera.  Using this camera for vacations and other activities requiring battery use proved more expensive as the camera has a very short battery life.  Once you take your picture you can view it immediately in the viewfinder and decide to keep or delete the picture.  A tripod is not included with the camera but is tripod-mountable and has a 10-second timer feature. 

The PDC-700 has a resolution of 1024 x 768 and a 4mb internal memory for storing pictures.  For additional memory, you can purchase expandable memory cards for the camera.  I decided to not use this option because I did not want to spend any additional money for the adapter and software necessary to read the expandable memory cards. Instead, I use the AC adapter and take pictures of family members and/or auction items and simply download these images to my computer. Downloading the pictures to my computer is easy with the included PhotoMAX software. The camera plugs into the computer in an available port and once you install the PhotoMAX software you can easily download your pictures. You can also adjust the resolution and settings of the camera through the PhotoMAX software. 

The included software also has fun features such as placing digital pictures of friends and family in the &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; and other fun characters.  You can also adjust the lighting, tint, size and many more elements of the pictures with the software.  While these features are available, I have not to date had any use for them as all the auction and family pictures I have taken with the PDC-700 have been clearly satisfactory and uploaded successfully to the internet while set at 1024x768 resolution. 

When I began researching digital cameras for this price range, I was pleasantly surprised at all the features available on the Polaroid PDC-700 in comparison to other digital cameras in the same price range.  The priorities in my research were as follows: 


1.  A digital camera under $300.00
2.  A resolution compatible for auctions and a family digital pictures
3.  A viewfinder with keep/delete options
4.  Internal memory with an AC adapter   
5.  Easy to use menu on digital camera
6.  Easy to use software

In shopping for cameras based on these criteria, the Polaroid PDC-700 provided all of these features for me at around $220.00.  Other cameras in the same price range provided only one or two of these features and most often did not include a viewfinder.  I have owned the Polaroid PDC-700 for three months.  I have taken over five hundred pictures with this digital camera and have had no trouble with the camera, software or uploading of the images to the Internet. As with most products, the more you are willing to spend the better the product.  In my experience, the Polaroid PDC-700 has proved to be worth the price due to the many features, hassle-free use and quality of digital pictures.
