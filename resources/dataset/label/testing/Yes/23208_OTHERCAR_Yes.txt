            I am in the process of buying a new car and I find no comparisons to the Honda Accord.  Of course you could pay more for the Toyota Camry, but why?  I hate looking for new cars, but I feel in love with the Accord.  I know many people who have owned an Accord and they always agree that this is the best vehicle and they would not purchase any other.  It is fun, classy, sporty, and there is enough room for the family to travel.  You can drive this car even after the wheels fall off.<br>It's a must if you drive!!<br><br><br>
