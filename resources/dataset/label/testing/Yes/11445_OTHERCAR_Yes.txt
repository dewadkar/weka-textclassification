            I bought this camera about a year ago.  I bought a large stack 50 of generic Mini-CDs for $20 and they work great.  I also bought a 50 stack of Memorex Mini-CDs for about $15 on sale.  I use the camera all the time.  Although it is heavy and bulky, I don't mind because the image quality is great.  The only trouble I have sometimes with images are if I'm moving...  sometimes the image blurs a bit.

I hardly ever use the MPEG movie feature because I have a good digital video camera and the videos from the camera are not of great quality, but are ok for short little videos to e-mail to friends.

There are many features on the camera and it takes a long time to learn them, but I believe it's worth learning.  There are many manual setting features that would be good for a professional type of photographer, but I don't mess with them because I have no idea what to do with them.

I also love the self-timer and it gives me plenty of time to get in the picture before it goes off.  The red-eye reduction works well too, but takes longer to take pics so I only use it in settings where I am taking group shots or something of the sort.  The AF illuminator "fills" in light under dark conditions and I haven't tried it yet nor have I needed it.  I also love the effects...  you can do Sepia, black and white, negative art, solarize, or just regular pics.  You can also choose the image size if you wish - the sizes are 1600x1200, 1024x768, and 640x480 with standard and fine quality.  I always take at full size on fine quality and get about 130 pics on the CDs.  In MPEG mode, you can do 320x240 or 160x112.

The one thing I miss the most on this camera is a view finder.  It took me a while to get used to taking pictures using the screen on the camera, but once I did it was pretty easy to do.

The zoom on the camera is excellent.  I do find that the digital portion of the zoom is a bit blurry, the the regular optical zoom is great and takes great photos.

I purchased a "sun" filter for the lens at a local camera shop for $6.00.  It helps with the sun glare.  I also found spare batteries on ebay for about $20 each, they work fine even though they are the Sony brand battery.  The batteries last me about 200 to 400 shots, depending on if I leave it on all the time or take 10 or so, turn off, then back on later to take more pics.  It takes about 2 hours to full charge the batteries each time.  

I really love this camera, but I only wish I would have bought the CD-300 to have the higher pixels now, but at the time the price was prohibitive for me.

I thought I would mention that I just took this camera on a short trip to the Poconos and took three mini-cds full of photos.  On all of them I got over 150 photos on each of them.  The most was 178.  I also got the camera a little wet at Bushkill Falls and didn't have any problems with it.  It took GREAT pictures of the falls!
