            May 2000 my husband and I bought a 95 Mercury mystique and at the time Everything about the car was great. It rode comfortably and was easy to control.

All was great with the car until October when we had to replace the water pump, the timing belt, the serpentine belt, the battery, the tires and numerous other things. Over all we put approximately $1500 into car repairs that month. We got the car home from the repair shop and all seemed well. So we thought. In November we were planning a fairly short road trip to visit family about 2.5 hours away. We got about 45 minutes from home when the car began to get really hot. We pulled over to let it cool. After about 30 minutes of letting the vehicle cool down we decided to turn around and head home. We didn't make it. We got about 15 minutes from the house when the car stalled. we had the pleasure of pushing the vehicle to a parking lot about 100 feet away and calling for a ride.

At this point the car is still not running and we are still unsure as to why. When the mystique goes it really goes. Now we are in the process of getting a new engine. Hopefully then the car will be on the road again.

The Mystique was my first car and I think for a first time driver this car would be a great choice because it handles like a dream.
