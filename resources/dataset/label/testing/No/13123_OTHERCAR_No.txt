            After a disastrous test drive of the Malibu, my husband and I decided to lease a Lumina.  A friend had one and we liked it.  So we test drove it, and after an ordinary run, decided the price was too good to pass on.  We had recently moved to the suburbs and didn't trust our teenaged Nova to hold up in the rough winters here.  We needed a back-up car in a hurry.

My husband is six foot six and needed leg room, so we decided to get a mid-sized vehicle, and the Camry, our first choice, was too expensive.  We learned, once again, that you do in fact get what you pay for.  The Lumina is quite inferior to the Camry.  It's downright cheezy.  The upholstery is very chintzy and there's plastic everywhere.  Because of the passenger side air bag, my husband doesn't have much more room than with the Nova.  The seats don't go back for enough, so the ride for him as a passenger is not as comfy as we thought a mid-sized car should be.

The radio is a horror.  It sounds tinny and doesn't pull in stations too well.  I have better reception in my Nova.  There's a cassette player, but the sound from that isn't any better.

Most annoying is the fogging problem this car has.  It fogs up at times and defogging is painfully slow.  I end up wiping the windows down manually.

The air conditioning and heat are mediocore, and both take a long time to kick in.  Passengers in the back seat often complain that the air conditioning is reaching them.

Although this car has six cylinders, the pick-up is not what you'd expect.  And if you have a load in the trunk it's even worse.  But it does maintain speed pretty well once you get going.

When we leased this car the sticker on the window told us we would get 29 miles to the gallon highway, and 24 or 25 city.  But alas, I've never gotten better than 24, and I only do highway driving with this vehicle.  I often get less than that if I do even a little non-highway driving through the mountains.

Handling is okay, but nothing spectacular.  I would prefer a tighter drive.  For a mid-sized car, the Lumina is pretty big.  Not a pleasure to park, either.

I don't regret leasing the Lumina.  I'm just real glad that it is a lease and I will be able to give it back in a couple of years.  It serves its purpose as a back-up car, and is a nice looking car on the outside.  The inside is boring.

There have been no problems with the Lumina in the seventeen months that I've had it.  It's under warranty for the duration of my lease, so I'm not too worried.

When this lease is up I'm going to buy a car.  Leasing is too nerve-wracking because I'm worried that I might get a stain in the carpet or a scratch or a ding in the exterior, and then get taken to the cleaners when I turn the car in.  It also just doesn't feel like it's mine.  I do a lot of driving and need to feel comfortable in my car.  But riding in my leased Lumina is like going to that rich aunt's house who has all sorts of expensive stuff around, and you're afraid to make a wrong move and damage something.  You just can't really, thoroughly enjoy yourself!

I see a lot of 1998 and 1999 Luminas on the road, and I figure it's because Chevy was giving a good lease price most of the year.  It's not an awful car, it's just that dollar for dollar, I think you get more for your money with a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord (if you can fit in it).
