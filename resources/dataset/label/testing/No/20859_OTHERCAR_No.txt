            I am not really in the market for a new car at this time; however, I have noticed the new PT Cruiser a lot lately and felt that I might want to give this attractive new car a test drive.  I headed over to my local dealership and found, amazingly to me, that one was available for my group of friends and I to take a spin around the neighborhood in.  I had heard many reports on the cars' performance,(mixed reviews but I really had the need to try the vehicle out for myself.  Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed in the results.

I drove the less expensive version of the car which is the called the 28D.  The main difference between this version and the more expensive &quot;Limited Edition&quot; model were the seats. The version I drove had cloth seats while the more expensive model has a mixture of suede and leather interior. It is important to note this difference because it did not effect the performance of the vehicle during my test drive.

The main difficulty that I have with the car is the fact that it has absolutely no power.  The car has a four cylinder 150 HP engine which I find to be massively underpowered for todays' driver.  I realize that the car looks as though it was made in the 1940's, but it certainly doesn't have to drive like it as well.  I found it very hard to enter a crowded intersection and furthermore, it was a real chore to get up to a decent speed on the highway.  I travel a lot in heavy traffic so therefore I obviously need a great deal more power than this car provides.

The next problem that I noticed dealing with this vehicle is the fact that the mirrors, both side and rear-view, have been re-styled which has made them very hard to use.  The large posterior of the vehicle is about all one will notice when looking out the small rear-view mirror.  I found it hard to even tell if anyone was behind me on a less-traveled road.  Furthermore, the new styling of the side view mirrors has made the blind spot so big that merging is fairly unsafe.  I heard many an unhappy horn from motorists on my left that I did not see as I was trying to merge.  In short, for this reason, this car is not entirely safe and changes should be made in this area at least.

I will say that the car is outwardly eye-catching.  It's 1940's design is very unique and thus many people have flocked to purchase the Cruiser.  Also, the cab room is surprisingly adequate and comfortable.  I do feel; however, that the cons outweigh the pros on this one and I personally would not purchase this vehicle unless changes were made dealing with the engine and the mirrors.  Many other vehicles are just as attractive with better performance.
