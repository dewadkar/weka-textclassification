            Lack of power from the 4 cylinder even with 5 speed

Horrible brakes - too long stopping distance, no real grab unless stomped on. 

Seats are too soft and have no support (seat sides have collapsed at about 18000 miles)

Noisy - not very well insulated from the engine/other noise

Leans too much on cornering, tends to whale-tail.

Molding on driver's door fell off - why did they put holes in door for molding clips and then glue it on?  I have seen others on the road that the molding was off also.

Hard to see backing up due to high trunk - looks nice styling-wise, and gives a large trunk, but hard to parallel park.

Would rather drive my 1992 Honda Accord EX wagon with 180,000 miles - much more powerful with 4 cyl, MUCH better brakes (hard to compare since it has 4 wheel disc brakes with anti-lock - which you can only get on the Jetta GLS and GLX model with the 6 cyl as I remember), better cornering even being a station wagon, firm seats with good support, quieter, etc.


We originally leased it because it was $160 per month for 2 years and ended up buying it.  Why did we buy it?  We were preapproved, didn't have to put any money down (didn't have any to put down at the time), needed a car, didn't have problems with it since new other than above and was $10000 to buy so we figured we couldn't get anything else in that price range comparable without the hassle of getting a loan, having to pay to register it, needing to put money down or pay initial costs, etc.  Not a bad car, but I guess I got spoiled with the Honda and a Nissan I owned before.
