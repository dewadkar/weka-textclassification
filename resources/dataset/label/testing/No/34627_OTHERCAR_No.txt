            This truck has been good for driving to work and back everyday.  It seldom has any problems. The 4.0L Ford engine is pretty solid but lacks power for those who need it.  It gets great gas mileage.  The controls inside are hard to reach.  The speedometer went out at about 50,000 miles and we had to replace the whole instrument panel.  This was very hard to find not coming from the dealer, which wouldv'e been about 600 dollars! Don't EVER take this truck too far off the road if it is mildly wet unless you want to get pulled out by big bad Chevrolet.  That one back wheel wants to do all of the spinning.  It held up pretty good in a rear end collision.  The bumper just got bent straight down but that was all that was damaged.  There's a lot of room in the bed.  The one really bad thing about this truck is the way the transmission shifts.  It jerks so hard through 2nd and 3rd that you'd think something was getting broke in there.  By the way, the transmission got totally froze up during one southern Indiana winter.  One other thing, don't lean on the center arm rest too much cause it will start hanging sideways.
