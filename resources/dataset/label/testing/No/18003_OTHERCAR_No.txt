            When I was looking for my first car in 1995, I did some research in consumer magazines looking for reliability information and repair histories.  Saturn scored consistently well in these, and so, when I found a used 1993 Saturn SL1 that I could afford, I went for it.

I've had time since then to regret that.  The first year and a half or so was relatively smooth, but when the first problem kicked in, it was a doozy.  The engine head block cracked.  This is a solid block of metal that should only be cracking if it's subjected to temperature extremes, like overheating.  It cost me over $2000 to have this part fixed--a fifth of the price of the car, used.

I was pretty well outraged at that.  I'd seen all of the Saturn commercials talking about how Saturn owners are &quot;family&quot; and how they're a &quot;different kind of company&quot; with a &quot;different kind of car.&quot;  So, I wrote Saturn a letter explaining my situation and my dissatisfaction.  I asked them to demonstrate that they stood behind the quality of their cars.  Now, I didn't specifically ask for money, though that was my primary hope.  But information on how to maintain the car so this wouldn't happen again, or some sort of coupon for maintenance, or _something_ would have been appreciated and appropriate.  What I got was a letter that looked a lot like a form letter explaining that the car wasn't under warranty, and there were no recalls, so they wouldn't do anything for me.  And besides, the letter insinuated, most car problems at this age of the car are the fault of the owner anyway.

This was a &quot;different kind of company&quot;?  I was &quot;family&quot;?

Since then, I've had two generators fail, the emissions solenoids fail, and leaky hoses in the transmission; and I've had to get the engine cleaned out twice to try to get rid of the oil residue in my coolant that the cracked head block let out.  I'm expecting to have to pay more over the lifetime of this car just to get it fixed as it cost me to get it in the first place.

I've had other problems, too.  Frequently, when I'm starting the car and trying to back out of a parking space, the anti-lock brakes go into a &quot;self-test&quot; mode when I'm trying to brake before hitting whatever I'm backing out toward.  This self-test causes the brakes to stop working briefly--which I find to be hazardous.  When I try to accelerate the car from a stop on wet (or, occasionally, dry) pavement, some sort of &quot;traction control&quot; system kicks in.  I don't know exactly what it does, but the car jumps around a lot.  It feels like it's trying to die, not get me moving.  The windows rattle unless they're set at a particular point, which tends to move around, so I'm forever adjusting them.  The seat belt latch on the passenger side rattles noisily unless something holds it in place.  There's a persistent squeak that emanates from the trunk.  The air conditioning deflectors are fairly cheap plastic, and they break easily unless handled delicately--and they don't have a full scope of movement, either.  I can't get the driver's side air to aim toward me as I like.  The shoulder harness on the driver's side tends to get &quot;stuck&quot; sometimes, not allowing much freedom of movement--and occasionally remaining stuck after the car starts, so that the automatic system that's supposed to let you out instead tries to cut off your breath by squeezing inflexibly on your chest.  And the horn is rather anemic--I've failed to get people's attention across the street with it, which leads me to wonder about its effectiveness in an emergency.  The power locks can only open all doors from the driver's side, which I find to be a questionable feature (though I understand that later models do this differently), and occasionally fail, making getting into the car from the driver's side an adventure.

That said, there are a few good points about my car.  The ride is fairly smooth, as long as traction control isn't kicking in.  The fuel economy is steadily around 27 MPG, and can be well over 40 on highways.  A door ding that was enough to scrape paint off the driver's side door didn't leave a dent, just missing paint; and, similarly, the last time I got rear-ended, there was no damage at all to the rear bumper.

Overall, though, I've been disappointed with my Saturn experience.  The car has had more than its fair share of problems.  The company was completely unsympathetic to this, and even went so far as to insinuate that it was my fault.  It wasn't what I was expecting for a car with such high reliability marks.

Most people I know who have Saturns love them and have little trouble with them.  They say they're puzzled by my experience.  Well, I am, too.  But I'm not going to risk it again.  I wouldn't buy another Saturn.<br><br>
