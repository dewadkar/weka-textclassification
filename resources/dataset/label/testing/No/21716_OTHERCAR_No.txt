            	Our Cavalier was a 4-door dark blue model with 2.2 liter 4 cylinder engine, 4 speed automatic w/ traction control, A/C, anti-lock brakes and cd-player.  It was the first car I had ever purchased brand-new.    
	Here's what attracted us to it:  A positive review from a respected publication (I can't remember exactly which one), room, fuel economy, anticipated reliability, front wheel drive w/ traction control, the body seemed solid, appearance, and performance.  The fact that it was the second year of production for the new style and not the first was a factor that helped boost my confidence.  Also, my Grandmother has a 1984 Cavalier that is actually still ticking (although not really well).  Then there was consideration of all the above for the price as compared to competitive models. 
 
	Here are some reasons why I'm so happy I was able to trade the car in on a vehicle that is essentially foreign-made after one year.  Number one:  The seats.  Although I don't feel quite as strongly as Lightningdon in his review entitled "Only If You're a Masochist" I'm certainly close.  I would often get a backache on my 20-25 minute commute home in the Cavalier.  I think it was due primarily to poor lumbar support in the cheap seat and the low-to-the-floor slouched position.  Number 2: reliability issues.  Staceygill's review reminded me of similar recall campaigns I had to submit the car for.  They don't help your confidence much considering that this was the second year that this style was produced.  Please also see my comment on Stacey's review regarding the stalling/rough idle problem.  Bottom line: if you have this problem and your dealer is having trouble diagnosing it ask your dealer about reprogramming your automatic transmission (esp. the 4-speed).  Number 3:  At high revs the engine used to sound like a big lawnmower engine that was being revved at it's max... or something like that.  It was a little strange.  Number 4: The rear end was high enough but the front was a bit too low for me.  It's not the greatest bad-weather/snow car out there.  Traction control seemed to help in some situations but in others I question if it was helping or hurting.  Number 5:  The folding rear seatback was nice but for heaven's sake it should be a "split" folding seatback.  Number 6: I was disappointed to learn that my model of Cavalier was not recommended to tow Anything.  Even my Mom's 1994 Nissan Sentra is rated able to tow 500 or 1000 pounds when properly equipped.  The base model Cavalier should tow "0" even though it's got that big 4 cylinder.  

	After having said all of this I don't think the Cavalier/Sunfire concept of the late  90's was "all" bad.  It showed some effort and innovation.  Unfortunately, not  enough thought was put into the viability, reliability, and longevity of the cars, especially the base models.  It's another car that I wouldn't purchase again.  If you are compelled to buy this type of car or think you've found a great deal I'd have to recommend only going with an LS model so at least some of the above problems might be improved.

       2-17-01 Update - My Grandmother traded her '84 Cavalier in on a '97 LS model and is happy with it.  She doesn't use the car as much as most of us would but this does lend a little more support to the idea that the LS model has more potential.
