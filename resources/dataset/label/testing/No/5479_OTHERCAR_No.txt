            My Prizm was a rental car from Enterprise.  I had the car for 
two days - long enough to see if I would consider buying one.
My concerns are:
1. With fewer that 1,900 miles, it was over running hot - it was
   not pegged out but running much warmer that it should have.
   There was fluid in the reservoir - I checked it.  Enterprise
   was going to send it back to the dealer to check this.
2. Side winds at freeway speeds tend to move the car around.  I
   thought that my 1958 V. W. Bug was the last car that was blown
   around that much; the Bug had an excuse with its negative
   camber suspension.
3. I know that this vehicle was for basic transportation, and no
   doubt gets decent fuel mileage.  More attention to fabrication
   of molded plastic parts doesn't have to be expensive - just
   made with better designed tooling.
I was looking forward to driving this vehicle, and am glad that I 
did.  Other cars in the same price range can be found that have
more features such as a better/firmer suspension.  I have have
not worked on an automobile production, but have toured the Pontiac
Plant in Kansas City.  I have 30 years experience in manufacturing.
GM can do better for a paying customer.  I hope that I get to
drive an improved model.
