            I am the owner of a 95 600SL.  I bought this car three years ago and it has been a lemon since the first day.  It has needed consistent repairs, with over 60 days spent in the shop.  The vehicle has around 55,000 miles (12,000 of them mine)but drives like a car with 10 times the mileage.

The ADS system is great when it is working but it needs repair often.  This in no longer covered by my warranty.  The car is falling apart with each day.  It rattles more than a 20 year old Pinto.  I am getting rid of this thing as soon as she comes back from the dealer.

This is my first and last Mercedes. I love the styling, handling, and performance when it is running; but this is by far the least reliable car I have ever owned.  Cars that cost this much should be much more dependable.  I have owned five different Fords in the last ten years.  All of them combined haven't been to the dealership half as much as this beast.<br><br>
