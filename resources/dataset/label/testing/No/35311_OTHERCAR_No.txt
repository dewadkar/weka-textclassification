            A live and learn story:
I bought a Casio QV7000-SX camera online after reading numerous reviews on
how great a camera it is.  Found it at a good price, received it just over a year ago.  I have used the camera for the past year and it takes fantastic photos.  For over a year, reformatting disks with the rechargeable batteries or regular AA batteries worked fine. 
About 2 months ago I started receiving Compact Flash errors on the
camera.  The 1 year warranty was up so I called Casio about how to fix this.
They said: reset and reformat the compact flash disks (I have several disks I bought extra) with the camera but you cannot do this only with your batteries. You must use the AC adapter which does not come with the camera. So I bought the AC adapter for 55.00 including shipping and this does not fix the problem.  To fix the camera I have to send it to NJ at my expense plus pay Casio to fix the camera if it can be fixed.  This was going to run well over 100.00 plus the 55.00 adapter I had just bought.   I have called Casio technical support numerous times about the CF error (which they mention on their website and how to supposedly fix it) evidentially many other people with this camera are having the same problem, and they aren't standing behind their product. So instead of being without a camera when I need it for work.  I went to Best Buy, bought a new Sony FD-85 with a 4 year warranty included with all the accessories included and if anything at all goes wrong with it, I take it to Best Buy and get a new camera.  Yes, you can get a great deal online.  But if the item needs to be fixed, then the hassle and major cost begins.  It's not worth the hassle or the chance of being without the camera when I use it for my job. Beware.
