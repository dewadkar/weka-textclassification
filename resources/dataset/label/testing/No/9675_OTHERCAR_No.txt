            The Dodge Neon has some very obvious perks and some very obvious flaws.  
Among the flaws:  The 1996 and 97 models have ecspecially bad transmissions.
My brother, who is a used car salesman for a Dodge dealer, says thought that after that years things have seemed to improve.
They are otherwise not very durable, and I wouldn't be in a car crash in one.  I was, and my air bag did not go off, but I was OK.
On the other hand, they are great for immediate performance.  they have good pickup, acceleration, and very good gas mileage.  They are also fun to drive.  
I'd look around first, unless you had maybe an extended warranty or were leasing.  Its a good rental car, but I wouldn't own one again.<br><br>
