            You'd be wrong!

I truly love having our Cherokee, since we live in the Northeast and move often.  It's nice to know that if I need to move a big piece of furniture, or have to get somewhere after a big snow, I can.  But if the Cherokee were the only car we owned, my ankles and knees would be ruined by now.

For some reason, the people who designed this car apparently figured only short people would want to be in it.  And they also apparently thought no one would ever think to put a rear-facing car seat in the back seat.

We have a 95 Cherokee and a 91 Acclaim.  By *choice*, I drive the Acclaim.  I am 5'10&quot;, and there simply isn't enough room for my legs when I'm in the driver's seat of the Jeep.  My fiance, who is 5'6&quot;, has no problems with it.  

The other problem I found arose when we tried to install a rear-facing convertible car seat in the back seat of the Cherokee.  After much investigation, I found that the seat was simply too shallow for most rear-facing seats.  At a car seat checkup station when my son was still in his carrier seat, the expert investigating my seat warned me to that effect, and I was quick to find out how true his warning was.  Whenever possible, we took our son out in the other car until we turned his seat around.  

Add to that the fact that it, like most SUVs, gets about 15 MPG, and overall it's not the car of my dreams.  As a second vehicle, the Cherokee is great.  As an only vehicle, I wouldn't recommend it.
