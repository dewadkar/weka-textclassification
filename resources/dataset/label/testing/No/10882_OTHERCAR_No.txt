            We have always been loyal Nissan customers, our first car was in 1983 200SX and then 1989 Nissan Maxima.  We've owned Nissans before and we were very satisfied with our vehicles.  I currently own a 1997 SE Nissan Pathfinder.  Much to my disgust, I HATE the car.  Our Pathfinder only had less then 20,000 miles and we had to replace the brakes.  Since then, I've the replace my brakes a total of 4 times.  The Pathfinder isn't even three years old.  Everything inside has &quot;fallen&quot; apart.  The center glove box lid had all the screws fall off, the lever on the driver side fell also fell off, not to mentioned, the suspension is very choppy.  I had a flat tire, and it was difficult to release the spare from it's position, even with the owners manual and the tools provided.  (the spare tire is secured underneath the Pathfinder) We've taken the Pathfinder in for several tune-ups and brakes.  I'm ready for a new car and I will NEVER purchase a Nissan again! I very disappointed with the service department and the overall performance of the vehicle.<br><br>
