            Unfortunately, I am one of the people that bought one of these out of the bad batch.  I have heard of others with good experiences, but here's my bad one.  I bought my car brand new in 1996 with 28 miles on it.  Almost immediately I started having problems with it.  Over the course of the time I've had this car, now with 61,500 miles on it, I have collected a stack of repair orders about an inch thick.  I have had the fuel-injectors replaced twice to help solve a dragging problem when I start it-I might add this problem still exists-I have given up; the gaskets in the motor replaced twice to correct oil leaks, it still mysteriously loses oil; the alternator has been replaced twice; the electronic air pump has been replaced three times-the first time the dealership had to reroute the air intake for it because it was originally in the wheel well; spark plugs replaced twice (for one of the 100,000 mile tune-up chevys); plug wires replaced twice; transmission fixed once early-on for a clogged filter because of some plastic piece had melted, then at 60,000 miles the clutches in the transmission burned up and it had to be rebuilt.  I've had various other problems, but these are some of the major ones.  I do not drive this car, it looks good in the driveway but I don't trust it, especially now that it's getting higher miles on it.  I know a guy who had his '96 bought back by Chevy.  Unfortunately the lemon law in my state isn't very helpful, the dealership where I take it for repairs was able to get an extended warranty for me free of charge from Chevy, but that took a lot of work on their part.  The seats are uncomfortable.  I don't even drive the '96 because of the way it runs (if I'm fortunate enough for it to run) and it's just not comfortable on the inside.  I think the 200 horsepower 3.8 in my 2001 has a lot more spunk than the 215 horsepower 3.4 DOHC in the '96.  The value on it has dropped drastically.  It rides like a haywagon, it rattles a lot.  Mine is leased so I get to just give it back this year, it was not helpful as a trade-in due to the low-value.  The only good thing I can say about this car is that it looks good sitting in my driveway
