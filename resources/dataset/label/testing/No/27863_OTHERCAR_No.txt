            After the birth of our 2nd child we felt the need to upgrade from my 2 door 88 Olds Cutlass which BTW has 160k and is still running on the same transmission! We bought the Caravan because at the time it seemed like the only option in its class. (The other minivans were bulky and drove like vans not cars.) This van was bought used with 17k miles on it (company fleet van). It has been one headache after another. After owning it only 1 week we took it on a trip down the east coast something related to the computerized transmission broke  while we were down there, causing the van to periodically shut down for no reason. Next the clutch on the aircompressor for the A/C broke. Both these problems were fixed under warrenty meaning there wasn't even 36k miles on the darned thing yet!!
The following summer the whole A/C unit went not just the compressor. The place where the unit attaches to the inside of the car became corroded and broke away. $800 to repair so obviously I do with out the a/c. (car was 3 yrs old at this point). Of course we can not possible leave out the troubled Dodge transmission problems!! Ours went at 70k on the highway 100 miles from home with 3 little kids in the car..You would think the Dodge would try and work on this notorious problems so people would want to replace their old vehicles with the same!! Any way Its about time to lay my wonderfully dutiful cutlass to rest. and we are in the market for a new minivan..its NOT GOING TO BE A DODGE!!The only thing I liked about this vehicle is that it drives like a car!<br><br>
