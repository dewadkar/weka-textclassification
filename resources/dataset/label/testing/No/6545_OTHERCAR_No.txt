            I am a repeat Dodge Caravan buyer. My first one was a 1995 base model. It was a wonderful van that required no service except for oil changes. Because it had been such a dependable vehicle I never hesitated when the lease was up . . . I was having nothing less than another Dodge Caravan.  This time though I chose to buy a more decked out model with the Sport Package. You learn from experience and I had found out from owning the first one that if you intend to keep peace between children and have room for adults riding in the 2nd row seats, you really must have captain's chairs.  I found the one I liked and was quite happy with it until the air conditioner went out in the middle of July.  As luck would have it I knew someone else that had the same problem just days before mine went out.  So off to the dealer we go to replace some sort of switch that the service manager told me had been a common problem with the 96 and 97 model vans.  A day and a half later we were on our merry way.  Well at 9,000 miles the rack and pinion on the front end had to be replaced.  The vehicle was less than 6 months old and I had only put 6 of those 9 thousand miles on it since I bought a dealer demo.  Well they told me it would be at least 3 days and I would have to rent a car.  I was not very happy and to make a long story short, after a few well placed phone calls, Dodge approved a rental car for me at their expense. Since that time, the back door has developed a leak that the service people cannot seem to stop and just this afternoon this vehicle left me stranded.  The power steering has gone out and it is sitting in a parking lot waiting for a tow truck in the morning.  There have been other problems along the way with the electrical system and seatbelts that had to be replaced.  I think I must have got the one vehicle that has a little bit of all types of problems.  Needless to say, when this lease is up, while I will still consider a Dodge, I will also be looking at other manufacturer's models too.  <br><br>
