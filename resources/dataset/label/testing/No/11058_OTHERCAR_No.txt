            I bought a '95 Mercury Mystique in November of '98 from Stadium Auto Mall in N.J. b/c my wife and I needed another car to commute. Needless to say, commuting has been an increasing headache. The first thing to go was the cruise control unit about 2 days after we got it, which they fixed. Then a month later there was a strong smell of exhaust whenever we turned on the heat. We brought it back, and they claimed to fix it. Two weeks later the smell started coming back, we brought it back, they said they fixed it again. A couple of months later the transmission went out. We barely got it to the dealer, where they said we needed a new tranny. Fortunately, we had the warranty, but it was still out for 2 1/2 weeks.

After that, the cylinder head needed to be replaced. Out for another week. Then the smell came back. They said we needed to clean out the fuel injecters, change the spark plugs, and clean the throttle-body for $700.00. They said this was also causing the extreme hesitation and loss of power we were experiencing as weel as the smell of exhaust (that they claimed to fix before). During this time, they said that they changed the catalytic converter as per a Ford recall. I changed the spark plugs, bought a throttle body cleaner and gasket, and fuel injecter cleaner for about $50.00. 'Nuff said.

About 5 months later, while going to work at night, the car broke down on the NYS Thruway. I had it towed to a local mechanic who said that the catalytic converter was clogged and had blown the egr system and the cylinder head gasket. In other words they did not change the converter. I am now contemplating suing the dealer. Others have told me about their problems with Mercury Mystiques, but not so much as Ford Contours. Right now the car is sitting in my backyard until I save up enough money to pay for what I know will be expensive repairs.          <br><br>
