            I am an impulse buyer. I tend to buy things based on the little information provided by the company.  Surprisingly, I am mostly happy with my purchases.  I bought the Agfa eSmile and was totally disappointed with it.  It was on sale for $90, but it is a piece of junk.  I cannot get any clear pictures, no matter how hard I try.  It is cute and I might give it to my baby sister to play with as a toy.  I bought the camera because it was compact and not too expensive.  I was going on vacation and I tend to lose or break expensive electronics when traveling.  I felt that this camera would be my solution.  Instead, I had a bunch of ruined pictures that I can hardly make out on the computer or tv.  Please save your money and skip this camera.<br><br>
