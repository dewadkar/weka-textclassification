            Is American muscle enough????  That is what i've been asking about this car for years now.  I've yet to see how a car this big and bulky and utterly ugly, can still be alive.  I don't understand what people see in this car.  It is not quick unless you have the 5.7 liter V-8 and it ain't pretty any of the time.  Here is what i think.

LOOKS

This car is ugly.  I would hate to get up in the morning knowing that i would have to drive this car.  It has little style.  It is yesterdays styling.  I miss the camero's of old.  The ones that looked fast and were fast.  The ones that were sought after all teens and even older folk, but i'm afraid those days are over.

INTERIOR

The interior is bland, just as the outside is.  There is nothing attractive about it.  It is just your everday interior, with nothing new to spice it up.  The seats are comfortable, but not really on long trips.  The ride is ok, but like most sports cars it is a little harsh at times.

ENGINE

Well this is one part of the car that can the a major plus.  I love the engine ( the V-8 )!!!  It has a stong will and is very fast.  It is bad for teenagers cause it is good at burning out at a local stop light, and with the 6-speed, the engine is WONDERFUL.  Only if Chevy would do this for all of it's engines.........

VALUE

Value??????? HUMMMMM................. I don't know.  I mean it's not THAT expensive, and with the wonderful V-8.............  Well i guess it is worth it, but with some of the other sports cars being just as fast and looking better, and being newer with newer tech.  I would say.........  Well I actually don't know, this one is up to you.
