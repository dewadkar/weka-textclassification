<TEXT>
             I bought my Dodge Intrepid in 1999.I fell in love with how nice it looked and how roomy and comfortable it seats and rides.I have 4 kids so it was a dream come true for room.It wasn't until the troubles started that I was disappointed.The windows started to become slow.Then the tires would wear.I had an alignment but I have went through 4 sets in 2 years.I have had and still are having transmission problems.The bolts that hold the head lamps are striped or broken.The lighting is very poor.The dims are better than the brights.I am now being  told the transmission problem is actually an electrical problem.Also,the head lamps have moisture in them.What's next?
