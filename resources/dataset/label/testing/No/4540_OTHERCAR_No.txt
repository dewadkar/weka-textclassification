            I received one of the first Logitech Pocket Digital Cameras released.  I thought the technology would have caught up by now to get a decent picture from a very small package.  Boy was I disappointed!  The camera was gorgeous to look at until you took a picture.  The quality was so poor; I believed that I must have had a bad camera.  I took a picture of my dog in fair indoor lighting from five feet away and you could not tell what the picture was of.  The pictures almost look like a blotchy, blurry, oil painting.  I have a very low cost web cam that out performed this device in picture quality.  They make a selling point of the Autobriteï¿½ technology, but in even generous indoor lighting the camera failed.  I am a big fan of Logitech, and I was very surprised to see them release something of such poor quality.
