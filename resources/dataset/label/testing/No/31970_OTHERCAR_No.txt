            I own a 1995 Honda Passport LX (manual transmission).  Since I've purchased the SUV, I've had to replace the clutch 2x (once at 37,000 and again at 65,000).  Honda refused to pay for the clutch even though the repair shop said it looked defective (warranty expired at 36,000).  Cost of repairs was $1,800 for the first and $3,200 for the second clutch.

In addition to the clutch, one of the power windows broke at 40,000 miles and the driver side airbag also had problems.

The SUV is nice, however with those repair costs, it definitely is not worth purchasing.

SUV handles well both on and off road.  I've take it out in mud, snow and the beach all with no problems.  Also the Honda has great internal space.  I've fit bikes, surf boards and furniture in the back without problems.  The drop down back door (rather then swing out doors) adds to the room available.<br><br>
