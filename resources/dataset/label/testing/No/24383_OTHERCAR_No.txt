            The Kia Sportage is really a piece of crap.    I had a 1996 loaded out 4x4.  Although the car looked great I spent most of my time at the dealership getting it fixed (I counted 18 days!).  The AT gearshift would get stuck and lock, I had this fixed 4 times!!!  (I should have lemon lawed it).  The AC broke 3 times, yes 3 in the middle of summer in Florida...need I say more?  The Kia has no power and when you need the boost to pass on the freeway or overcome any car at any other time you were shackey from go.   Don't try even a slight turn.  Closing the rear hatch was a pain in the you know what too.  If you you didn't slam it real hard it wouldn't latch and if it didn't latch right, you had to go back into the car and lift the little switch...lame. When you slammed it hard it sounded like it was going to break.  This is only the tiny bothersome problems I had, I also had problems with the engine itself.  And to top it off the service center guys were jerks who acted like I was a waste of time and I spent $24K on this &quot;lego-car.&quot;  PLEASE if you are going to spend the money BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!  If you buy the car after reading this...you've been warned ;)If I were to rate this car from 1 eye being cr*p and 5 eyes been sussed I'd give it 1 eye with a stick in it!  ---&quot;Smitty&quot;<br><br>
