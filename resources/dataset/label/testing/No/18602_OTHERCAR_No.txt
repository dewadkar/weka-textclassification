            My husband and I bought this vehicle for our then 16 year old daughter in August, 1999.  She fell in love with the look, and after test driving, we too thought it was the car for her.  
Problems started in October, '99 with the control on the radio not working-minor but it was a new car.  Knob was replaced.  Nov., '99, the vehicle was hard to start, the engine did not want to spin over.  Although diagnostic test was preformed at the dealership, the same results could not be duplicated.  Dec. '99, while vehicle was sitting still, the speedometer went from 0 to 140 and again, the dealership could not produced the same results.  
There were several people in the car at the time and saw what happened.  March, 2000, the passenger side mirror fell off and had to be replaced (mileage at that time was 7,722).  June, 2000, when trying to start the car, the engine ticks several times before starting.  Once again, nothing found.  This was repeated again in October, 2000.  We had a new power steering pump put in on October 23, as well as replacing the cruise control which had gone bad.  The mileage on that trip to the dealership was 16,144.  
Since, then, we have also had to replace the alternator and the driver's side mirror for the same problem as mentioned on the passenger's side, and the stereo system replaced due to problems ejecting tapes and CD's.  The car has had oil and lube jobs every 3,000 and has had tires rotated.  
My daughter loves the car, hates the trips to the dealership. Now, Olds is being phased out.  Now what.......<br><br>
