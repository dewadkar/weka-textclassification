            I just bought a 2001 Toyota 4-Runner.  Before I signed the paperwork on it, I drove the 4-Runner to the nearest Nissan dealer and parked it right next to the P-finder.  I also test drove them, one right after the other, on the exact same route.  I went into buying an SUV with a totally open mind.

Power:  This is the king of V6 powered SUVs.  The 3.5 liter, 240 HP engine is great!  It runs smooth and strong.  The 240 lb/ft of torque is impressive, as well.  You can tell that Nissan is making great strides in engine development.  I could go on and on about the power-plant.

Interior:  Another area of the P-finder that we liked more than the 4-Runner.  The cloth seats have a pattern that is much better than the Toyota's.  The Bose system is a nice touch, but I think the 4-Runner's sounded just as good, and it costs the same to replace on Bose speaker as it does to replace ALL of the speakers in the Toyota!  (I have a friend that learned this the hard way.)

Cargo:  The reason we were looking at SUVs in the first place.  The P-finder has a maximum of 85 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats down.  With them up, you get 38.  This is very comparable to the 4-Runner, except the P-finder has 5 more cu.ft. with the seats down.

Options:  OK, here's where I don't have all the info.  I know there are two basic models, the LE and SE.  The SE is the sport model, and the LE is the luxury.  They both have the same engine, but you can get a manual transmission in the SE.  Feel free to check out http://www.nissandriven.com.

Overall:  Wow, after reading that first part, you're probably asking yourself why I didn't just buy the Pathfinder.  The answer lies under this subject.  When I took the P-finder for it's drive, I noticed that it could turn on a dime in the city.  I mean it almost has sports-car like handling.  So, I took it on the freeway and shook the wheel.  You could feel the body-roll swaying the vehicle to dangerous proportions.  That sounds worse than it was, but I wouldn't trust that vehicle in an emergency situation.  I know all the magazines want an SUV that handles like a car, but I want my trucks to handle like trucks.  I feel safer, and they ride better to me.
