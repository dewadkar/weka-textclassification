            My Dodge Neon is a four door and red.  Since this was a use car, I didn�t expect much from it.  But I was hoping for something more.  First the air conditioner broke, and since I live in Kansas, that�s not a good thing.  Second, the locks on the door started to break off.  So I had to strain to lock or unlock the doors.  Maybe I just got a bad used car that someone tore up before I purchased it.  

Now I�m not saying I hate the car.  It�s a nice looking car.  The interior was nice and the seat covers weren�t torn.  The radio worked fine.  There was just something about the car.  It felt like I wasn�t safe, like I was riding in a plastic car.  On windy days for example.  It felt as if the car was going to blow over.  Also, the car gets dents really easy.  Just tap it and opps!  There�s a dent!  

And once the car gets used a while, it starts to make sounds.  Whenever you excelerate, it makes a loud barking sound.  This might not be true with all 95� Dodge Neon�s.  Just mine.  The owner before me could have treated the car with no respect.  I paid around 2000 for it.  When I first got the car it was a pretty nice deal.  Good looking, drove nice, and felt safe.  But after a year or so, it turned on me and became loud.
