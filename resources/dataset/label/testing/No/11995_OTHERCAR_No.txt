               I bought the car because of the interest rate, and i liked the look of it.  I love the performance, it handles the road very well,and its stereo isn't so bad either. What I HATE about this vehicle is now as it is snowing out, my car will not stay defrosted without leaving the heat on high the whole time. The inside of my car gets frosted up more then the outside windshield. The ride on this car is pretty good, smooth. The kind of person who should by it is someone who likes the sunshine state, not someone who likes the snow. <br><br>
