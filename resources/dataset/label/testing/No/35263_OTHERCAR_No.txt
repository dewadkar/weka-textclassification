            The car I am reviewing is my moms car.  I drive it too.  My moms car is a 1992 Mercury Topaz GS four door with about 80,000-90,000 km on it.  The interior looks almost new because it has been kept well. the outside and the inside is a nice maroon color with hardly any scratches on it or dings. It has a 96 horsepower 2.3 Litre engine with 126 pounds of tourqe. The engine is pretty peppy but sounds whiney if reved too high.  We've had the car about a year and a half now.

Here's the low down:


My mom has had quite a few problems with it. some of them were the temperature gauge broke, the brakes were worked on but still make a grinding noise when pressed too much and the timing belt broke a couple of months after my mom bought the car.  The interior is poorly designed, there are no cup holders and some things are coming loose.

All in all I would not recommend this car to anyone.  Just because they have them at my dads fire hall doesn't mean they are good.

No wonder the Mercury Topaz was on the consumers digest worst buy.  I'm going for Honda/Acura or GM<br><br>
