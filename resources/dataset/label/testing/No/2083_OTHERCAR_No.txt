            This past year, I have been looking for a car that I would not be scarred of taking off-road and still have the capabilities to take what I had to give it. I found the 4.0 rang rover to do so quite well in my trail run. It glided quite well with the 4 wheel perm. drive. I felt that this car was very luxarious with many features I did not need. I thought the sound system was excellent but little did I know what the price was. When I told the salesman I was interested he told me that the base price of a 99 range rover was 59,500; I laughed and asked the man &quot;seriously what is it.&quot; He of course said this is the base price. Well I have to admit in this SUV, you find an exceptional off-road vechicle, great sound system, and ease of use but when you think about this logically, you have to ask yourself should I just buy a Z-71 for 25,000 and spend 15,000+ buying enhancements to make it one bad off-road vechicle. I think I would take option B. This SUV is nothing more than a status symbol and the people who own this car and wave it proudly and know in their minds that they paid 60,000+ for a vechicle that did not cost a fifth of that!<br><br>
