            There are certain things that Hollywood does that they never mean for society to follow.  I remember back in 1983 when National Lampoon released the movie <i>Vacation</i> with Chevy Chase, Beverly D�Angelo, Anthony Michael Hall and Randy Quaid.  This movie was supposed to be funny � supposed to be a big spoof � and it was one of the greats to come out of Hollywood.

One of the funnier things that happened occurred in the first minutes of the movie.  If my memory serves, Clark Griswald went to trade in his family car for a new car that he special ordered.  When he got to the dealership, he was shown a really goofy-looking station wagon and told that it was the car he ordered.  Naturally, Clark threw a fit, because that station wagon was the most hideous car ever created.  It had a front end that made no sense and all sorts of stupid other ornamental and cosmetic changes that looked like a car designer used LSD before putting the final touches on his design.  Unfortunately, the dealership already �disposed� of his trade-in, so now he was stuck with that hideous beast.  He then had to go home and convince his family what a great car it was.

I first saw the 2001 Pontiac Aztek riding down the road about a month ago.  I remember staring at the thing, wondering what radio station was pulling some prank.  I then realized it was a very real vehicle.  My second thought was, �Oh my God, did someone think that car from <i>Vacation</i> was supposed to be real?�

The Aztek definitely qualifies for being the most unique car on the road in recent years.  The last time something looked so out of place, it was the 1970s and I saw my first Citroen � a quirky French car that few Americans would bother owning.  Some things are better left to the French.

I suppose the designers at Pontiac were looking for a futuristic look.  Okay.  They certainly got a different look.  If this is the future, I�m going to stick with the nice, boxy design of the Toyota 4Runner and the other cookie-cutter SUVs.  Those at least look normal.

The Aztek�s front looks a bit like the bow of a ship.  Its nose comes to a point.  A pointed nose looked strange enough on another GM model, the Buick Skylark.  To make matters worse, the grille is a two-port design with air-ports in the hood.  It has headlights in what I could only guess is part of the bumper, and then the turn signals are on top of the fenders.

Walk to the rear of this monstrosity, and you�ll see equally strange lines.  The rear panel is set too high, and the liftgate has a sharp slope.  In reality, the first car that crossed my mind was the rear-end of a Honda CRX.  If you can picture what that vehicle looks like, then lift it right off the ground, you�ll have the rear end of the Pontiac Aztek.

From the side, the Aztek looks like a late-model Pontiac GTO on steroids.  No, don�t confuse what I said with the classic GTO, which was a fabulous car.  The late-model GTO was a sub-compact that looked like a bunch of parts from the leftover bin at GM and then was somehow miraculously put together.  It was a major failure, and thankfully didn�t last long in production.

Pontiac also doesn�t want you to confuse their Aztek with an SUV.  Don�t worry, Pontiac, it isn�t an SUV any more than a PT Cruiser is.  Pontiac refers to the Aztek as a SRV � Sports Recreation Vehicle.  Allegedly it is a combination of an SUV and a mini-van.  In fact, Pontiac will tell you sports sedans, minivans, and SUVs inspire the design of the Aztek.

Strangeness doesn�t end with the car�s exterior.  Take a peek inside, and you�ll see even more strangeness.  Smack in the middle of the dashboard, between the front, bucket seats, is the control panel.  Here you can control the sound system, climate controls, and just about everything else with the touch of a button.  It looks shockingly out of place until you look at the driver�s display.  Those same strange shocking colors pop up for a tachometer, speedometer, and other displays.

The rear seats are split-flip/fold and are able to be removed from the vehicle, adding to the limited cargo area.

What is nice about the interior and design of the Aztek is the field of vision.  Not only do you get an unobstructed field of vision for the front and sides of the vehicle, but you sit higher than you do in a car, giving you an advantage to see over traffic (unless, of course, you wind up behind something larger like I always manage).  The rear of the vehicle was a bit difficult to see out of, with the strange design and angle of that rear window.

I found the seats comfortable, at least in the front.  I didn�t feel that my six-foot frame was cramped in the front, and commend Pontiac for that feature.  The back seat was and very uncomfortable.  While I expect the rear seats to be smaller on almost every vehicle in production, I�d not want to spend five minutes in the Aztek�s rear seats.  I guess there�s only so much you can do with a back seat these days without dumping you in a Cadillac or Lincoln.

What I found very neat about the Aztek was the audio controls inside the cargo area.  Obviously, Pontiac�s designers had in mind for people to want to listen to the radio without being inside the car� such as at a tailgate party or simply camping in the woods.  The dropgate even has molded cup-holders to hold your beer or pop.

The other strange feature you�ll notice about the Aztek is that it isn�t a four-wheel drive vehicle.  I would have expected them to toss that feature into a vehicle this ugly that is supposed to be a Sports Recreational Vehicle.  Part of the word �recreation� � at least in Colorado � means being able to get to your destination in all kinds of weather.  The front-wheel drive system of the Aztek will get you through a lot, but won�t get you to the ski slopes on a snowy day.  Rumor has it that the mid-season 2001 model will have an All-Wheel Drive system available as an option.

The powerplant of this vehicle is a 3.4-litre, V6 engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission.  It produces 185 horsepower and 210 feet-pounds of torque.  It is suitable for towing up to 3500 pounds.

The vehicle has a 108.3-inch wheelbase and is 182.1 inches long.  It does handle tight turns with ease.  For a 3780-pound vehicle, the V6 provides sufficient power to get it up hills in a reasonable fashion, although no one will ever be racing up Pikes Peak in one.  It simply doesn�t have that much power for high-speed acceleration.  Low-speed acceleration, however, is significant.  It does have a very quiet ride.  You don�t hear much in the line of road noise or engine noise while tootling around town.  The wider track of the vehicle also leads to good handling.

The vehicle is rated at 19 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway.  It takes 85-octane unleaded gasoline (the same as 87-octane in lower elevations) so it will run on the least expensive gasoline. 

The 16-inch wheels and suspension are set low enough so you don�t need a ladder to get into the vehicle and don�t need a parachute to exit.  However, it only provides 6.7 inches of ground clearance, which isn�t all that much higher than a standard sedan.  Good luck to you if you wake up in the morning and it has snowed all night.  You�re stuck until the plows get around to your neighborhood.

For safety�s sake, the Aztek comes equipped with an anti-lock braking system on all four wheels, two second-generation airbags in the steering wheel and dash, plus side-impact airbags, and daytime running lamps.  It has a Passkey III theft deterrent system that disables the fuel line and starter and battery run-down protection.  You can also get an optional traction-control system for wet- and icy-road driving.

The colors available for this car are nice, short of the Aztek Yellow and Citrus Green � both of which you�d never lose in a parking lot.  These colors are a chore to even look at without getting nauseous.   The interior colors are all earth tones, which is very easy to get used to.  However, they seem to be in sharp contrast to the annoying neon lights that make up the dashboard and central console system.  Leather seats are also available in the GT model.

The base price of the Aztek is $21,995 and the base price of the Aztek GT is $24,995.  With added-on packages, you can spend as much as $27,410.  Naturally you�ll tack on license, tag, dealer options, and sales taxes.

Aside from looking different, I don�t see any big deal with the Pontiac Aztek.  Unless you relish the idea of finding your car in the parking lot immediately (I wouldn�t even want to park next to one of these things), the vehicle itself isn�t any big deal.  I think the SRV will probably miss the niche that GM is looking for until it at least brings on All-Wheel Drive as an option.

If Aztek is the future then please, by all means, kill me now.
