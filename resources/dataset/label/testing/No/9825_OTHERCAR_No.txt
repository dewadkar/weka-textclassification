            The 1997 Camaro is a great car with a few drawbacks. Has a lot of standard features. Such as Duel airbags. Anti lock breaks. AC. Powerful   V-6 engine. Has six speakers for a well balanced sound in your stereo. Has full size spare tire. So don't let a dealer try to say that it should cost you for extras. This car looks sharp. Drives great. Here are the drawbacks. It has a hump on the passenger side in the floor board which crowds you if your sitting on that side.. Hard to get in and out of. Makes a lot of noise if you are sitting in the back seat while riding down the road. Just from the tires. Not much of a trunk. It will take getting use to the front end from the drivers side because you can not see how close to an object you are. That is a design thing. Has a low front end that will scrub on any dip that you go across. You have to go slow across dips, and even then it may scrub on some. The front dash is very huge. Takes a few minutes to defrost. Has a good AC though. I would not pay more than $14,000.00 for one with 30,000 miles on it. A lot of dealers will screw you on this car because it is a Camaro. If you buy one point out these flaws and drive down their price. Hope this helps any of you who read this. Oh yeah! This is a sport car. High insurance rates. I got a great deal on mine. $12,000.00 - 20,000 miles.  Maybe 2<br><br>
