            I bought this vehicle brand new in 1995.  I traded a 1992 Saturn.  The reason I traded the vehicle was because I figured I bought a lemon because of the problems I was beginning to have with the car.  Since I have had the 95 Saturn, for the first 60,000 km, I had no problems with the car.  Then the car began to give me problems with oil consumption.  I persisted with the car dealership and they finally worked on the engine and replaced the valve seats.  This however, only improved the problem to reduce the oil consumption to below the companies policy of fixing the car.  At 100,000 km (thank god I had extended warantee) the timing linkage adjuster fell apart and pieces of adjuster went through the engine and caused damage to the head.  Saturn rebuilt the engine however, I paid for them to change the rings and clean the pistons.  The car has not burned oil since therefore I decided to keep the car.  The vehicle is very nice to drive and the features the car has for driving, handling and looks are excellent.  Saturns should only be leased for a 3 year period.  Do not buy the vehicle for any other reason.<br><br>
