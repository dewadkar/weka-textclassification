            Warning.  I bought my mini van in to a Dealer in Ocean,NJ to have them fix a recall problem.  It came back worse.  I took it in a second time to have it corrected and when I picked it up they said everything was fixed.  When I got home I personally checked it out and it was leaking.  This is a vehicle I transport my three children in(all under 8 years old).  This is a reflection of American Pride in action.  Avoid this vehicle and their vehicle service areas at all costs.  My next van will be a Honda, after I dump this pig.<br><br>
