            The Audi TT 1.8T engine is a very good choice for this car.  150hp for this size of car is more than enough to race all those Ricer cars.  My previous car, a 2000 Cougar with a V6 engine was no match for this little bomb.  This car is also very easy to modify and you can get more than 200hp on this beauty for almost no money.

The handling in curve is pretty good and this car accelerates...fast!  As I always say : "ï¿½a avance par en avant!".  I was pretty surprised of its handling in snow.  Mind you I equipt my car with winter tires (very useful up here in Canada).  I would of thought that my wheels would have spinned more in snow because of all the power delivered to the front wheel on a start since it wasn&#146t too hard to lay rubber on stop signs in the summer!  Still that little traction control light in the dash flashes a lot!

I really love the clutch and the transmission which are really easy.  The lights in the dash are pretty cool at night.  The car looks like a little BMW which is pretty cool.  The seats have been pretty comfortable for any trips we did so far (average of 6 hour trips).  The trunk can fit a lot especially with the back seats that fold.

The three things that, I guess annoy me with this are that the seats attract every single kind of lint know to mankind which kinda makes this car really hard to keep clean.  The trunk is very large but the opening of the trunk is small and of course... the dealership service!  I am pretty sure that when no other car company wants to give you a dealership cuz you suck, that&#146s when you become eligible to get a Volks dealership.  The service is horrible and does those people ever order the right parts?  This is even worst than the Canadian Tire parts service!  

UPDATE 2002/08/26
After driving the car for almost 1 year and a half, I would NEVER recommend this car!
We have had the dealership quote us extensive labour (3 hours for a MAF sensor at 56,000kms)which should take less than an hour to repair as quoted by another vw dealership. Then they tell us our rear brakes were seized and pads need replacing, which when looked at by another garage:  the brakes were not seized! and our window..front driver's side has just fallen into the door.....
Whatever you do, don't buy one!
OH yah, the glove compartment box is tout fini as well.

UPDATE 2002/09/24
Passenger side window just fell in the door.
Dealership says power window motor also have to be replace cuz it's overheating and will break soon.

UPDATE 2003/06/19
About 2 months ago, we got the car in the garage for an oil change and to check an oil leak as well as to check the engine light codes...again.

Oil leak around the turbo, catalytic converter needs to be changed, O2 sensor is gone, and the mass air flow sensor is defective again, it was just changed in August 2002.  The rear breaks where also ceased...again.  2 weeks later this car was gone!  The best thing we got from this car in the last year, our payout!
