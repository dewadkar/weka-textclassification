            The story is sooooo long and I really don't want to bore everyone with it.  I'll gladly fulfill individual requests with the log of events I've been keeping since October 2000.  Here's the summarized version:

2000 TDI, delivered in Sept 1999.

13K - Oct 2000 first major problem - check engine light.... Glow plug relays... other mild complaints as well, but typical stuff.
By January 2001, I'd been to the dealer 5 times for the same problem --- the check engine light comes on every 3 weeks, almost to the day.
I've been though the BBB Autoline and reached resolution with VW of America.... They took my car back to their corporate labs and rebuilt the car.  I drove a dealer car for the 2 months mine was getting witchcraft done onto it.
I got the car back in April 2001 with 1,100 additional miles on it.  I renegotiated my resolution and in addition to the lease payments they made for me, VW of America also paid me .20 per mile on the 1,100 they put on my car. --- It's a lease... and they're gonna make me pay if I'm over the mileage stated in the contract, right?
Anyway... I thought I was home free... a near-new car and still the one I picked out in 1999.
Until now.... it's Oct 2002 and my car has had the same problems as before -- they started again in August.  It's relapsed and is out of remission... but this time it's terminal.
In addition to my compaints about only getting around 300 miles per tank of gas (SINCE I GOT THE CAR IN 1999)... they've replaced the computer thingi in the car, the glow plug relays again, the passenger side window regulator for the 2nd time this year, the driver's side window regulator, the stupid keyfob thing that broke, some SRS (airbag) problem which made that light come on my dashboard along with the check engine one (and that makes the nighttime blue dashboard UGLY!)... and my sunroof is still broken!!!!
Wanna know more?  email me at vwinfoplease@prething.com

Enjoy your TDI's folks... I can't wait for VW of America to replace mine with something else... I'm thinking Volvo...........

3/35/2003 --- UPDATE::::::::::::  My motor blew up!!!  I'm getting a new engine right now.... I can't believe this car!
