            I leased this car for two reasons, first, it was my first German car, and second, it was a bit of reach financially for me.  In hindsight, leasing it was the smartest automotive move I have ever made.  I got a quattro, 2.8 litre manual example.  I wanted to enjoy the "driving experience" of this car, so I chose the stick.  The first thing I noticed from the minute I drove off the dealer lot was, "where the hell were the 190 horses?"  Even in a stick, it felt as though I was driving my mazda 626.  Even my Sentra Se-R could've left this car in the dust.  to the Audis credit, the interior is gorgeous for the driver and passenger.  But no way would I want to be in the back for more than 10 minutes.  There was barely enough room for my son's child seat.  On top of that, the trunk is so small that you have to kitty-corner a set of golf clubs to get them to fit.
Now, onto my bigest gripe and the reason why I was so happy I leased the vehicle.  This car breaks down alot!  Way too often for a $35K vehicle.  Air sensors went frequently, the brakes went early, but the most unbearable problem was the front suspension links.  They went as well, and when they fail every time you turn the wheel a fraction of inch, it sounds as though you are rubbing a wet balloon.  On top of that, Audi was back-ordered on the parts necessary to fix it (gee, I wonder if they were back-ordered because this was a common problem).  My theory on the problem with this car is the brakes.  They have very large rotored Bosch brakes which work great, but produce an inordinate amount of brake dust.  This asbestos ladened material cakes on the wheel, the suspension, the brakes themselves and becomes corrosive.  I would wash the car, drive it home, and the brakedust is there.  This also results in constant brake squealing.  I have three friends who own Audis or the comparable VW equivalent the Passat, and guess what?  Each one of them had the front suspension links go!  Yikes!  This car is not worth the 35 large it costs even without the maintenance problems.  Take my advice and move on.....
