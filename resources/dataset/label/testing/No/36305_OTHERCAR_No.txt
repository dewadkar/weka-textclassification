            First of all, let me state that I am by no means an auto expert; I'm just a normal car owner.  I have owned an Infiniti G35 for four months now and would like to relate my experiences.  To begin, the G35 looks great, accelerates well and handles very well.  In my opinion, though, it is not a "premium sports sedan" as advertised.  Thus far in my ownership, I have encountered a number of irritating issues.
Fuel consumption is very disappointing, especially given the fact that premium grade is recommended and gasoline prices are at very high levels.  The car is rated at 16-22 city and 22-30 highway.  Well, after having driven it for 4,000  miles, I am barely getting 16 in the city (which comprises 95% of my driving.)  My highway mileage is about 25, which is within an acceptable range.  Another disappointment is the Bose stereo system, which is a $900 option.  This system is average at best and cannot handle any bass to speak of.  I have all my audio settings at zero and still the speakers and doors vibrate when certain music is played (my tastes tend toward basic "rock".)  A third issue is the number of annoying rattles when the car encounters any type of road irregularity, almost as if there is something inside of the doors.  These occur both during city and highway driving.  I have the sport suspension and understand that the ride should be somewhat bumpy (believe me, it is, you will feel everything.)  I don't really mind that, but I do mind the rattles that accompany the bumps.  The ride is not what I would call "tight".  Two other dissatisfactions are grabbiness and noise in the brakes when coming to a complete stop or starting from a stop and wiper blades that "scrape" at times, even when it is raining at a good rate.  As with many things, you get what you pay for.  In hindsight, I should have paid up a little more for a genuine "premium sports sedan".

Okay, it's January, 2003 and update time.  I have had the car for over 7 months and 7,000 miles now.  All of the above still apply and more.  To begin, the headliner now rattles when the driver's door is shut if the car has been left out in the sun.  Second, there is a rattle in the dashboard near the clock.  Also, the outside temperature reading on the dashboard is sometimes very inaccurate.  Finally, the front wheels generate an excessive amount of brake dust.

I have been a Toyota owner since 1987.  This is my first (and last) experience with a Nissan product.  My experience with initial product quality in this particular instance has been very disappointing.  What I initially thought was going to be a "fun" car to drive has now become merely a "means of transportation".

Over the past few months, I have been attempting to reconcile my experiences viz-a-viz all of the hooplah surrounding this car in various automotive magazines.  I have come to the following conclusions:  1) my car was either built on a Monday or a Friday; 2) the car reviewers do not keep the same car for 7 months; and 3) when a car is delivered to the reviewers for testing, the manufacturer makes sure it is in perfect shape and running condition.

To be as fair as possible, let me say this.  If all you are looking for is power and handling, you should consider this car.  If you are looking for anything beyond that, you owe it to yourself to consider other alternatives.

Finally, I am taking my car into the dealer tomorrow to attempt to address the issues relating to my dissatisfaction with the car.  I will keep you updated on the results.  They are giving me a loaner Infiniti to drive for the day.  I will be curious to see if the quality is any different.
