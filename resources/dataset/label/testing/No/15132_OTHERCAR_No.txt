            I purchased this car just after I graduated (1996) high school.  I was excited because it was a new car and had much power.  Now in 2003 I'll share some of my thoughts over owning this car.

EXTERIOR:

The styling of this car is not offensive.  Thats to say it looks good without shouting at you.  That said one has to recognize that the styling of a car is highly subjective.  The one thing I have noticed is that the spoiler is redder than the rest of the car.  The funny thing is I just noticed the other day when I was washing it (normally I go through the touch less car wash.)  Not sure what the cause is but given that most of the car is cheap, I just accept it as wear and tear.


INTERIOR:

The interior has ample leg, shoulder and headroom for my wife and me.  We are both under 5' 8" so this is bound to not be an issue.  The view forward is good as is the view to the rear.  I know the seats are not the best available but I have always found them comfortable.  I unlike others like the red backlit gauges, to me they are easier on the eyes than white or green.  The gauge cluster can be blocked by the steering wheel depending on your height and where you like to position the steering wheel.  Once you are able to see it you get a Speedo, tach, temp, and a fuel gauge.  On the left side on the steering column is the turn signal/light stalk.  The car has auto on lights so I never need to use the light switch unless it is raining.  On the right side is the wiper control.  My car didn't come equipped with an intermittent wiper so I find myself resorting to the off/on method of intermittency.  The air conditioner is ok but I have seen more powerful systems.  Perhaps it needs to be recharged, but that would mean a leak somewhere.  The blowholes for the air are well positioned and you will never find yourself wanting for cool air.  A/C controls are as follows.

Left knob: Blower speed control
Center knob:  Temperature
Right knob:  ac, max, floor/face, face, floor, feet/defrost and defrost

 My car was only equipped with an AM/FM radio, however the dealer gave me a credit ($250) to upgrade the radio.  Both the radio and ac are bit of a stretch but they are visible and easy to adjust.  There are two cup holders up front, but only the back on toward the console is of any real use.  The front cup holder is rendered almost useless by the shift lever. There is a small storage area in forward of the front holder good for holding small items (i.e. cassettes, earrings, etc).  On the roof is another small cubbyhole good for insurance cards or even the occasional dollar bill.  While we are in this area now is a good time to discuss the visors.  They don't block the sun very well and the fabric band has stretched never to return to its former tightness.  The center console is big enough to hold your cell phone and a few cd's.  When you open the lid of the console there are two cup holders available for the backseat passengers.  Speaking of the backseat kids are about all that are going to be comfortable back there.  

The years have not been kind to this car.  Cars that are made cheaply will tell on themselves as the years go on and this one is no exception.  The vinyl is starting to peel away where it meets the side glass.  The control for the driver side mirror has on numerous occasions fell into the door, mainly because the plastic retaining ring has cracked.  This is also the case with the driver side door lock of which I have yet to recover, at least the passenger side is ok.  My car came equipped with manual windows and I am proud to say they still work.

The trunk is big enough to fit several suitcases if they are small.  Just make sure to watch out for the killer hinges.

ENGINE/TRANSMISSION/SUSPENSION:

What can I say; this is a very strong engine and still is even today.  My dad always told me to drive car like it was on its last leg and I still do.  I have never revved the engine above 3000 RPM.  This is more a testament of its power than my careful driving.  Power use to be plentiful but now it struggles up even the smallest hills in fourth gear.  This also coincides with a knock inside the engine when pulling away from traffic lights (it doesn't do it if I pull away verrrry slowly).  I can't imagine what is causing this but I assume it's related to the fuel system.  The car went through its first alternator about 30000 miles into its warranty.  Little did I know that it would be the first of 3 to be replaced.  Speaking of electrical, a peculiar problem popped up a year ago.  When I turn the car off the key remains stuck in the ignition.  After a few minutes it releases, but a few times I left it in there because it took too long and it drained the battery.  A mechanic couldn't find the cause so the problem still persists although it occurs off and on.  Not related to this I think is problem where the car would shut off allof the sudden at speeds below 55.  It occured without warning, just all of the sudden the car would be off.  It all of the sudden stopped doing this and I am glad, this is a very dangerous problem as it affects braking and steering.  Luckily when it happened I was on a road with a wide shoulder. I never found what the problem was, but I'm assuming it's electrical.   

Unlike the engine the transmission has been nothing but reliable.  All I've done to it was change the filter and fluid.  I'm keeping my finger crossed on this one.

The brakes are strong and sure, however I think the front rotors have their own agenda.  I have replaced the front brakes on at least three different occasions not because they where worn but because they where warped.  No matter how carefully I tried to break them in the end result is always warping after a few hundred miles.  Again I should state that I drive very carefully and haven't made a panic stop in any vehicle in over 2 years, so warping from bad driving isn't the cause.  Based on some research I have done, higher quality aftermarket rotors should fix this problem.

Can't say too much about the handling except that it still rides fairly well if not a bit rough.  It's sure through corners and never feels like it's going to plow into another car or mailbox.


OVERALL:

This was a good car, but I feel a dark cloud over the horizon and am looking for another car in the next year.  In my opinion this car should last upwards of 150,000 miles or more if it is babied.  If not look for major problems to start creeping up about 100,000.  If you can get a decent price on one (less than 1500 dollars) and it hasn't been abused than take it.  Otherwise look elsewhere, unless I'm selling it too you. lol
