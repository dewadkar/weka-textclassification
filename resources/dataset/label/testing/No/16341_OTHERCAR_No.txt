            This digital camera was a second generation &quot;improvement&quot; upon a prior model.  Unfortunately, H-P had an undisputed 'winner' in its prior incarnation (C-30) and committed the ultimate commercial taboo: they &quot;changed a winning game&quot;.  The C-200 is certainly adequate as an 'entry level' camera for beginners -- but that's it.  For the price charged, considering its features -- or lack thereof -- and the antiquated serial port connection in this &quot;old&quot; age of USB, the value is lacking.  Pictures taken in bright sunlight without the flash are adequate, but the flash brings the camera down a notch more, since it is inadequate to properly expose anything more than just a couple of feet away.  The absence of an optical zoom is another large drawback, since the digital zoom results in serious distortion.  Even when it was $299 (and $100 less than other brands with optical zooms), it was overpriced feature-for-feature and pixel-for-pixel.  Remember......this is NOT a 1.3 Megalpixel camera -- it is ONLY 1 Megapixel(995,000+ pixels), so it has 30% less resolution potential than its similarly priced counterparts.  Although it IS very easy to use -- almost intuitive -- it also suffers from a flimsy plastic case and some bulk.  It will NOT fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.  It also 'inhales' batteries, so be sure to bring along an extra TWO sets if you're going to use it to any appreciable extent on a trip.  Its LCD is not sufficiently visible in bright sunlight, so it has a number of serious basic flaws that contribute to its diminution in value and performance.  All in all, H-P, a GREAT company for reliable computer hardware, really missed the boat on this one.  It is only now getting around to finally correcting this mistake (and the C-500) with a new line of digital cameras -- almost a full year after it started rebating the purchase of this &quot;calculated misconception&quot;.  <br><br>
