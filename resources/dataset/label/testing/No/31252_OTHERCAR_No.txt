            We bought our 95' Grand Am in 1996. We needed a reliable car that looked nice. It had 20,000 when we bought it and it was an affordable car. We got a four door SE model. Well at 25,000 miles the transmission went out on the car! Luckily it was under warranty so it was fixed for free. We have also had the head gaskets replaced at around 30,000 miles. 
I have been driving the car for about four years now. I would say it is for the most part reliable but I do not think I would but another Grand Am!
It has a roomy back seat &amp; trunk, it is a sporty looking family car for a family with no more than two kids.
One complaint I have is that it always has some many noises and rattles coming from the dash and well everywhere. They call it integrity &amp; this car would rate bad in that area!
Another complaint I have is the way it handles over speed bumps or other bumps in the road. I even got new shocks &amp; struts &amp; it still does not go over bumps to good.
We did take a fourteen hour road trip in the car (there were three of us), and it was fairly comfortable!<br><br>
