            OK, OK, I know I will get all the beating for this, but after all, my opinion is my opinion.
On a recent trip to the States I had the dubious privilege to be stuck with one of these for a month as a rental car. During that time I covered over 4000 miles, and, sad to say, we didn't become friends, the Pontiac and I.

It starts with the styling of the car, which looks like it was involved in a major accident. These corrugated thingys along the flanks make the door gaps to appear about an inch wide. There is not a single area on the whole car to rest your eyes, it's all fussy, like dotted wallpaper with pictures on it, if you know what I mean. Now if this is what they mean by 'we build excitement' then they truly succeeded. To my regret, this messy theme continues inside the car as well.

Apart from these matters of taste, the car has significant design flaws as well. I understand that these are cheap cars that have no class, at least so I was told by every collegue who saw me driving it, but that doesn't bother me since I'm not status concious. What bothers me is that apparently to GM it seems to mean nowadays that 'cheap' equals 'bad'. This is sad since GM gave us great cars in the past. But evidently the Dow Jones followers have finally won over the automotive engineers at GM. As a result, you, the customer, has to suffer.

How else can you explain that the car looks, feels and smells 'cheap' everywhere. You move a lever, turn or toggle a switch, press a button, they all feel and sound as if they will break that very instant.

The dashboard looks fuzzy, the dials are messy to read and a clock is completely absent, unless you switch on the radio. 

The most annoying thing though, is that the top of the dashboard is prominently reflected in the windshield, including these round air outlets. 

The steering wheel has an awkward profile to grab and never feels comfortable. It is also mounted too low, so I had to use the tilt to adjust it higher. In no other car I had to do this yet. As a result, the wheel ends up at an awkward angle. I also tried to leave it in the intended position and lower the seat, but then I couldn't move the seat far enough back to accommodate my legs in a comfortable position. In any case, it was impossible to achieve a seating position that is right for me. Visibility is bad at any position.

The cup holders are positioned ahead of the gear shift lever so it is impossible to reach them without actually looking at them, a dangerous task, especially during night drives, when you need your coffee the most.
I also don't know which genius had the idea of providing as the only ashtray a round thingy that fits into one of the cupholders. Apart from that it is as difficult to reach as the cups it is not illuminated, which is dangerous to the extend of being criminal. And if you want to smoke AND drink, well - screw you!

The trunk, though quite spacious, is awkward to load thanks to the trunk floor being lower than the trunklid opening and too far away from the rear. So you have to lift everything too high and too far forward from your body to lower it into the trunk. The actual opening is significantly smaller than the already too small trunklid so loading even my duffle bag wasn't possible without squeezing and bending it. Leave your Samsonite at home.

Driving the Pontiac isn't much better.
The power steering is extremely unprecise around the 'middle' or 'straight ahead' position, something that has been overly critizised and thankfully done away about a quarter century ago. 
Now welcome back, thanks Pontiac. 
As a result, it is impossible to negotiate bends the way it should be done, i.e. you set the steering wheel according to the radius of the bend and hold it still through the bend. To drive the Pontiac straight ahead, you also have to constantly correct, like you had last in cars with bias belted tires. Driving the winding mountain roads in eastern California, usually great fun, was a tedious process with the Grand Am.

OK, so lets stay on the interstate and see what it does there. Sorry, no go there either. Pontiac engineers didn't see it fit to provide a place for your right foot if you engage the cruise control, forcing you to either hover it over the gas pedal which leads to cramps after a while, or positioning it under the brake pedal, lethal in an emergency. Where to put your left foot in a car with automatic transmission is another secret only known to Pontiac engineers. Best hang it out of the window, or what?And if you have shoe size 11 or more, forget the Pontiac altogether, you will always be stuck at the dashboard with your toes before you even reach the pedals.

A blast from the past is this totally antiquated emergency brake pedal of yore. A handbrake has to be between the seats, nowhere else, especially in a front wheel drive car, just for safety reasons.

The car I drove was equipped with the four cylinder engine which is in no way up to the size and weight of the car. It sounds stressed under all circumstances, acceleration is mediocre and every hill or mountain significantly slows the car down. Forget overtaking.

On the braking side, we are back to the spongy, impossible to meter binders, lethal in a front wheel drive car if things get messy.

Handling is surprisingly wallowing, spongy and trucky for a car this size, it feels like a two-and-a-half ton dinosaur. I indeed expected it to be more swift and responsive, like -say- an Intrepid. That doesn't mean it is soft and comfortable though. Bumps and ruts get into the car unfiltered, waves make the car to shake more and more and more and yipeee, we are flying. 
Pontiac engineers mastered successfully the near impossible task to design a suspension system that is neither comfortable, nor sporty, nor safe. If pushed hard, the car understeers and wobbles with considerable tire squeal. This makes it excellent for car chases in movies but it's far away from fun to drive.

All that is going along with a fuel consumption that would suit the handling, but not the size of the car. I don't care too much about it since gas prices are still dirt cheap in the US from a European point of view, but it makes a tank full only last for 200 miles or so. The annoying result is that on long trips you have to fill her up more often than you have to stop to go to the toilet. 15-20 mpg I easily achieved with my venerable Caprice V8, which had a bigger tank to boot.

The list of annoying things doesn't stop here. 

You always have to lock the car twice because all you get on the first touch of the button is a 'blimm, blimm'. C'mon. EVERYBODY knows that American car manufactureres will never build in an anti-lock-you-out device like every car made in the rest of the world has, so you never lock an American car without absolutely making sure that you have the key on you. At least I do so for about 15 years driving Americans.

In exchange, the Pontiac has a tendency to lock you in. Everytime I just stopped to take a photo or so and left the engine running, the car didn't want to let me out. Listen, Pontiac: Doors should unlock when you put the shifter in 'park', understand? Plus, they should open from inside despite they are locked.
You think I'm too stupid to unlock a car from the inside? Buy a Pontiac and find out yourself how annoying this is.

Driving along the L.A. interstates on a September evening, I usually prefer an open window to A/C. Not in the Pontiac. The inside is getting extremely drafty, to the extent that things get blown out of the window, plus you can't bear the noise, even with partially open window.

Thanks god, I was able to turn this heap in after four weeks. 
If you bought one, sorry.
