            My dad got this car for me because I go to college 6 hours awayfrom home.  I looked at a camry and the altima.  I liked the camry but it was priced higher than the altima.  The cam. was about 14-15k and my altima cost 12500 with 12k miles on it, we bought it from the dealer.  I got a GXE with everything but leather.  It has a sunroof, spoiler, a/c, power, cruise control, etc.  

I've had this car for maybe 7 months and if I had to use one word to describe it, i'd say brick.  This car is heavy and strong, my cousin got rear ended in one by a truck going 50mph and the back seats were ok.  The 2.4 liter engine delivers really good low torque so you can stay in the lower rpms while driving.  The gas petal is not touchy at all, but when you need some power on the highway it'll be there.  It gets about 370 miles on one tank.  The previous owner also put some nice 15 inch rims on the car and it makes a big difference in the look.

The car handles great in snow, it gets a lot of grip for a FWD car, with snowtires it would be unstoppable.  I've seen some ice and snow with the car and it doesn't get stuck easy, i havn't got stuck yet.  I've even been on roads coated in ice and the only effect was the steering felt mushy, its quality.

On my ride from college to home i average 80, maybe 85.  It goes faster than you would probably want it to.  I've carried a lot of people in the car but it still doesn't have to use higher rpms.  I am comfortable the whole way home, I don't even shift in my seat, well maybe a bit, but no complaints.  It is a 6 hour drive after all, nonstop.  The only thing that bugs me is the steering wheel might vibrate anywhere from 65 to 70 and up, somewhat randomly.  There is also some cabin noise, I believe all of it is simply wind going past the doors, the seals could be better.  This is nothing a little music won't fix though.
