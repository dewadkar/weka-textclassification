            We own a 1993 Geo Prism.  Although it is not a bad car, I would not go this route again for many reasons.

I am not a technical person, so I will not throw alot of stats and numbers at you, but I will give you an honest 32 yr old mothers point of view.

Roominess
There really is none.  We are a married couple with two children and it is much too small!  With a car seat in the back seat, the seat in front of it must be pushed all the way up.  I am only 5'4" and my knees touch the dash.  My poor daughter cannot sit straight in the backseat at all.  

The trunk does have some room, but the hydraulics for it take up space and limit what you can put in.  We have a cd changer in there so other than a small load of groceries nothing else will fit. And the trunk opening is not very large and has wires for the back lights right where they could be easily knocked off, so you need to use caution when putting stuff in...

Seats
If you have small children in car seats you may have a problem.  The middle of the back seat has a strange curve so no car seat can really go there without propping towels under both sides.  The normal seats in the backseat offer less movement, but the car is so small it makes getting the car seat in securely very difficult

Reliability
One area where I have no complaints.  We really have had few problems with it.  We keep up with the car and do regular oil changes, and it runs well. No major breakdowns (except for hitting the deer this week, that caused quite a bit of damage) and no major repairs at all... I know when I get into it, that it will start, no questions.

Engine/Parts
Since this is a small car the muffler tends to hang low.  During a heavy snow storm last year, just going over the snow in the road took off the muffler.. So if you are planning on driving on any roads but the smooth and straight forget it.

I know this is just a four cylinder car, but driving up any steep hill is a challange.  This car just does not have the power to climb much of anything

Breaks hold up pretty well, I have had some cars that chew through breaks twice a year, but this car is about once every two years.

Fuel consumption
Pretty good, but it does go through quite a bit more when hot out. We drive about 35 miles to work and 35 miles back a day and at present gas prices (1.52) we can go through five dollars a day in the summer... Kind of steep for this size car! But in the winter a full tank will take us just over a week

Body style
Cannot keep hubcaps on it at all... And if you look around at other Geo prisms, you will notice almost all are missing hubcaps... Not sure why, maybe all the Geo Prism hubcaps are with the other socks from the dryer!

Extras
It does have a cup holder,,,, But it only holds cans... no travel mugs, no fast food cups, nothing... the cupholder slides out from under the stereo and anything much taller than a can hits the curve of the dash.  The center console is much to small, does not fit any CD's at all. 

Summary
Overall a reliable car.  But if you have a family or are tall, you will find this car way too small and uncomfortable.  But if you are by yourself, it is a good dependable car! Just do not use for any off the wall driving and do not expect to put alot in it.
