            This whole Accent incident started when our 1989 Dodge K-Car exploded (caught on fire) in the Sears parking lot on Christmas Eve Day 2000.  Since my parents were panicking about returning to work with only 1 vehicle, this was a spur of the moment thing.  My father, my sister and I went window shopping for cars on the 29th of December.  We eventually stopped in at the Hyundai dealership who was having a special: 2000 Hyundia Accent for $179/mt.  We checked it out, and here's what we ended up with...

A 1998 4 door Hyundai GL.  (Those 2 extra doors cost $20/month each!).  An extended warrenty costing $1700/yr (over a 5 year lease) which does not cover a thing.  The way this works is you pay for your own towing and repairs, and they'll "try to reimburse you for it."  $50 every 3 months for the mandatory oil/filter change.  The air conditioner causes the car to stall/hesitate and smell of free-on.  Can't take the thing for a car wash, as the doors freeze up and won't close.  During the winter months, we noticed a 'funky' dead-corpse smell in the car when ever it was sealed up for any length of time.  We were told that all cars have that smell... it's part of the cooling/heating system. (YAH RIGHT!)  When driving over speed bumps in mall parking lots, the entire car shakes like it's in the middle of an earth quake and the front seats "squeak".  My sister and I both have pretty long legs (and wear high heels), and trying to sit in the back seat is a nightmare.  We've got our knees up around our ears the whole time!

After all was said and done, my parents new 1998 Hyundai Accent (down graded from the 2000) is costing them over $300/month.  So much for the advertised $179.  For this price, we should've bought a Ford.
