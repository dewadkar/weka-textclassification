            After three years of driving, I'd already been through two used cars.  When the second completely fell apart, I couldn't bear the thought of another used car.  So I went new-car shopping, knowing I had to find the perfect car-we'd be together a while.
I went to a lot of places and test-drove a lot of cars.  But I knew as soon as I got behind the wheel of a Saturn I'd found my car.  The seats were comfortable and easy to adjust, the car handled marvelously, and the sleek styling was just in my taste.
Living in New England, driving involves lots of hills, turns, and snow, all things my Saturn handles well (though I do have to slow down a lot to avoid fishtailing on ice).  Being young and in college, the low price was a Godsend, as was the contemporary styling and marvelous color selection (I got blackberry with a grey interior, and everyone says it looks marvelous).  The gas mileage is great, and I've had no trouble getting it started on these frigid winter mornings.  The seats are very comfortable, even on several hour drives.  The controls are all easy to use and find, and the gauge panel is easy to see even in the most minimal light.  The ride is smooth and quiet as well.
I've only had my Saturn for a few months, so there've been no trips to the shop for maintenance or repairs yet, but I suspect those will be few and far between.  The only thing I would have preffered is a slightly bigger trunk.<br><br>
