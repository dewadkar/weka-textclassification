            We bought a used '88 Excel a few years back. My only comment is make sure the previous owner heeded any recalls and do your research through NTSB!! We had an engine compartment fire in ours a week before our recall notice arrived in the mail warning of a possible engine compartment fire. My wife was 8 months pregnant at the time and she was driving. Nobody was hurt luckily.  After several months Hyundai DID compensate us a bit of money (not as much as they should have) after making us sign a form saying they weren't responsible. (strange paradox!)

The car had been good to us before that, although not the most peppy of cars.  I don't recommend getting an Excel used. <br><br>
