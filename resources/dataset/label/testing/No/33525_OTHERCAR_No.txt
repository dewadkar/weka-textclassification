            I purchased my Monte Carlo new in 1996, and I really enjoyed it for the first 3.5 years.  In fact, when it's working properly, it's still a lot of fun to drive.  In December 1999, my transmission went out at 58,000 miles.  About two months later, I also began experiencing problems with the turn signals not working.  Now my car is at the dealer for two problems.  The first was with the gear shift, which turned out to be a &quot;frozen pin.&quot;  Not a big deal since it will cost $65 to fix.  The second problem is the clincher. My transmission is, once again, starting to go out. They've determined the problem to be in the body valve and aren't sure if they will cover it as a warranty fix (I have a new GM transmission with only 7,000 miles on it; you can bet I'm going to fight for this one).

Funny thing is I know of two other '96 Monte Carlo owners who have had their transmission go out at 60,000 miles.  I was really looking forward to trading it in for a 2000 model; however, my experience with Chevys is over.  <br><br>
