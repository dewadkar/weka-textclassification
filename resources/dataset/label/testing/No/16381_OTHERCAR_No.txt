                  This particular camera was purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter. Ever since then all I hear are complaints about the batteries always being dead. Since my daughter is in gifted and talented classes and she has a very high I.Q., I have no reason to believe it is her lack of competence to operate the camera. I was told by a Hewlett Packard representative this camera was good for the money and a good accessory for my printer of the same brand. I guess that's what you get for $300 dollars. The positive of this whole experience is the camera matches the color of my computer, whoopee. <br><br>
