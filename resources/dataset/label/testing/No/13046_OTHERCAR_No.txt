            I used to have a 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix... It was a nice car and had all of the options... being only 19 at the time I thought it was the best until I rolled it four times...

I'm glad I was not wearing my seatbelt (and actually lived to tell about that)  
The point:  while my car was rolling the upper part of the drivers door was torn away from the car, do to the fact that the seat belt is connected to the frame of the door had I been wearing it, it would how totally tighted... who knows what may have resulted in that but I am glad I do not know... 

After that I was afraid to wear my seatbelt and was pulled over by the police 2 weeks later because I was not wearing a seatbelt.  I told him the whole seatbelt story and he told me that his department actually had used the Pontiac as squad cars until an officer was involved in an accident in which the door flew open and the seatbelt acted as a slingshot and shot the officer into traffic, the officer was serious injured.  Due to that the police department no longer used Pontiacs.  

I am not saying in anyway that the pontiac is a bad car, I actually liked it alot what I am saying is if you do purchase an older model Pontiac... check out that seatbelt.<br><br>
