            PLEASE READ THE ADDENDUM AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW!!!

I purchased a Japanese import 1991 2.0 Turbo Legacy Wagon GT here in New Zealand to take my family and 2 dogs on regular weekly visits to our beach house 100 miles away. This journey involves gravel roads and some twisty bends to negotiate. I wanted a vehicle that was safe, economical and affordable.

 My 1991 Legacy wagon fits the bill perfectly. It has automatic transmission and the 2 liter Turbo charged Boxer engine.
I like the Subaru's road handling and performance the AWD is exceptional.This car is quiet and smooth. 

Here in NZ they are great value for money and have a real good reputation.  A 1991 Legacy GT costs around USD3-5k in New Zealand. The turbo option certainly gives the car a lot of power and is recommended if performance is required. I have driven a 2L non turbo version of the Legacy and think it would be hard for anyone to go for one of these if they can get the turbo motor for a little more. The car has everything I need and is a no nonsense type of car.

 Mine has AC PS EW PM ABS and cruise control as well as a moon roof. For a nearly 10 year old vehicle with 50k it is in excellent shape with no rattles or funny noises from the engine. The automatic gearbox is smooth and efficient, but I find I have to stamp on the accelerator to get the turbo to kick in. It takes platinum plugs which are expensive and Ive heard from others that it pays to change sparks plugs every 50,000 miles and generally keep up the regular servicing / oil changes etc. as some repairs can be on the costly side - transmission and turbo problems to name two.  That said, my neighbour has a legacy that has done over 150,000 miles with no trouble at all.

 I have driven faster cars and better handling cars but for the money this is as good as it gets!
 
 This car would appeal to a broad cross section of people looking for value and safety. Drivers who traverse gravel, snow laden or icy roads have even more reason to get an AWD Subaru. The non Turbo version is a high recommendation for younger or first time drivers because of the safety issues.

ADDENDUM
One week after writing this glowing report the engine completely blew up! I was passing a car and voila!! A loud noise then nothing. I am a careful driver and nothing like this has ever happened to me before! Long story short I had to either get the motor fully reconditioned or buy a  new one. I opted for the latter...a 2nd hand engine for $1000 plus fitting costs etc. A total all up cost of $3500USD.

Well I thought...Im OK now, but I was well off the mark as exactly 2 months later the car stopped going again. This time I was diagnosed with a "stuffed automatic transmission." $2000USD and it was fully reconditioned and going again...or at least so I believed until I found a puddle of transmission oil under the car. If it wasnt so costly I would laugh about this stupid car!! 
The transmission guru siad he had a couple of these turbo Subarus in a week and he rated the transmission as woefully inadequate for the power the engine is capable of. Beware..you have been warned. I would say if you had this car from new or knew its history you may be lucky. In view of my problems I can no longer recommend the car but believe the non turbo versions do not have the same degree of trouble so may be good value.
