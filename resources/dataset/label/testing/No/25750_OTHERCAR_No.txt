            I own a 1999 Bright Blue New Beetle. I originally ordered a silver New Beetle but due to VW's overwhelming demand I waited for months and was told that if I chose another color I would get my coveted prize in one week. So I did, and I did. Even though it wasn't my first choice in color I get a lot of compliments on it. Took me half a year to get used to people waving at me in it. I kept wondering &quot;who are these people&quot;? I'm so used to waving at the New Beetle's car admirers it seems like a &quot;duty&quot; that I must continue. Smile and wave. :) The only people that don't acknowledge the car on the road are the ones with the same color. They look the other way. Oh, and I love to watch the &quot;Punch Bug Gangs&quot; who beat up on each other as they spy me.


So far I've found the feeling of driving the New Beetle smooth and fun. Only at rough railroad crossings do I get jostled. The brakes are great. Avoided many close calls of the rat race to work. I have only two complaints about the car. Being low to the ground I scratched the &quot;running boards&quot; by drive thru curves that I got to close to. The blind spots that the car has around the back window causes a little neck strain to make sure that I don't pull this cute car in front on any &quot;admirers.&quot;

Added comment (November 6th, 2003): Since having the Bug for awhile I've come across a couple of problems. The electric window mechanism broke down 2X in one window and 1X in the other. All three occurrences were fixed free by VW but it was a hassle ... seemed to happen on rainy days. They "say" they redesigned the mechanism but I'm still worried about the next time. Also, the original battery "blew up" just by turning the key. I asked if there was an electrical problem with the Bug and was told no. A year and a half later the new battery did the same thing. The battery is a pain to replace as you need to unhook other parts and move to the side to get the battery out. And the "admirers" are becoming daring as they actually slow down their cars to check the car out, causing potential collisions and some even pull out in front of the Bug, thinking that their kids, who are not in their child safety seats, can watch the Bug from the back window of their car as I drive behind them. Not a fun thing to do.
