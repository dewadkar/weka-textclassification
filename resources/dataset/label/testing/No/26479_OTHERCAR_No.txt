              Had to re-submit this one because the other just wasn't working, so here we are again...

I have owned two Chevy S-10's now. My first was purchased in 1995. It was a pretty teal green, regular cab, automatic, air conditioned, really nice. Loved that truck. 
I have always been a truck kinda girl! =) I have owned several cars, but love trucks! The Chevy S-10 is an all around nice truck. 
In 1997, we purchased a newer S-10. It was a 1997 S-10 in black. It, too, was regular cab with lots of options. It was a really sweet truck. 
It rode smooth, felt great on the road, appeared to be the perfect automobile. Then I began to notice some braking problems and problems with my seat belt. I immediately took it to the dealership and was told that they could find nothing wrong with my truck. So, I let it go.
In May of 1998, I was struck by a car running a red light. I was hit in the front passenger side, and their car swung around and the tail of their car hit the tail of my truck, that was 2 impacts already. To make matters worse, I was driven head on into a telephone pole, which broke into over the top of my truck, and the rear driver's side of my truck jumped the curb and smacked the steel traffic signal control post. I had 4 points of impact. 
My seatbelt did not catch me! My airbag did not deploy! Although I hit the brakes again and again, there were no tire marks to indicate that the brakes even attempted to work in that situation!
As a result, I was thrown against the steering wheel and suffered a broken breastbone, cracked ribs, broken wrist, and several other markings, including the blood filled bruise marks of the complete steering wheel on my chest for several weeks. 
The accident is now going to court for litigation. The visable scars have healed, but the emotional and some of the internal scars have not. Chevrolet denies any wrong doing with my vehicle. They are claiming no liability in the malfunction of the safety features. 
I loved the Chevy S-10's. My 1st one was a wonderful truck. Of course, who knows how it would have reacted in the same type of accident. My father in law, also owned a black, 1997 Chevy S-10 and his brakes failed coming down a mountain, causing him to hit a tree. Coincidental? Sounds familiar to me. Again, Chevy denies all wrong doing, but here I sit telling you about it, lucky to be alive!
