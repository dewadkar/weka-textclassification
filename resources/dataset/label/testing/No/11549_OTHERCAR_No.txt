            1999 Jeep Cherokee is an improved model from the 1998, but still has room for improvement. Handling and ride are better, noise level is lowered. Still has problem with severe pulling to side of the road depending on lane traveling in. 

The one consistent quality about the Jeep Cherokee that is to be recommended or is a plus, is the stereo system. The Jeep comes with an excellent stereo system which can be an enjoyable tool as a cover up for other bugs which Chrysler has not been able to get resolved. A few years ago Chrysler was proud to announce that the new model Jeep came with 40 new or changed items....the problem with the &quot;out with the old and in with the new&quot; concept devalued the long standing history of quality that went with the name Jeep. The last good year was the 1993 Jeep Cherokee. 

We have had nothing but problems with each and every new model which we have owned since the 1993 model, and after talking to other Jeep owners have found this to be consistently true throughout each one. Jeep has lost it's reputation as a dependable and high quality 4 wheel drive vehicle in this area. Dedicated Jeep owners are still buying the Jeep Cherokee with the hope that they will once again find what they have come to expect from owning a Jeep, only to be disappointed with each purchase. Many have moved  on to different manufacturer, others have remained tried and true Jeep owners. Those that have moved on are satisfied with the change, but not necessarily happy, like they once were.

The 1999 Jeep Cherokee that we currently own will be our last Jeep purchase, probably for the rest of our 4x4 buying lives. It is a shame to loose such a fantastic vehicle, but new is not always better, and the new Jeep is so much worse than the old. Bring back the older version, and the Jeep buyers MAY return, but in the meantime, sales will definitely be falling off due to poor quality and dependability. You can depend on one thing with the newer models and that is that you will definitely be disappointed with them....

When you feel that your life is endanger riding or driving in a vehicle, and this continues to be true from one year to the next....It is time for a change!<br><br>
