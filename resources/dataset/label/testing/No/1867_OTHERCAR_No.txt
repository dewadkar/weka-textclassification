            In October of 1997 my parents gave me their 1992 Pontiac Grand Am.  They were the only previous owners and they take very good care of their cars. 

First, the paint had been flaking for a little while due to a paint defect that was a fault of GM (it had been on Dateline.)  Part of the deal with my parents was that I would get the car repainted.  I called the GM hotline to see about getting it redone for free, to which the snotty guy on the other end basically replied &quot;go away.&quot;  I had not been expecting to get it done, but I would have thought they would train their people to be polite.  I pay to get it painted.

It was a fun car to drive.  It has excellent acceleration and I like the powerful engine sound when I started the car.  However, it was rather noisy, the brakes were a little frightening at times, and the gas mileage was only about 17 miles/gallon, although I guess that is probably standard for that type of car.  Handling was OK.

In early September of 1998, with 70,000 miles, the ignition lock broke.  It was fixed at a mechanic and seemed to be fine.  A couple of days later, the steering column starts to smoke and my car won't start.  I have it towed to a Pontiac dealership (Southpoint in Austin, TX).  First they replace the ignition lock (that took over two days.)  They say the starter is also messed up.  They get around to fixing that a few days later.  Then they say the alternator is messed up so they fix that.  At this point, it has been two days short of two weeks and I had been calling them every day.  My father calls them from long distance and gets on their case.  The mechanic I had been talking to tells my father he doesn't understand why it is taking so long.  My car magically turns out to be ready that day.  I go to pick it up.  The are new scrapes on the bumper and the antenna is missing.  I go up to two mechanics and ask for my antenna.  Dingiss #1 turns to the car they are working on and starts to take it off that one.  Dingiss #2, seeing my horrified expression and being slightly less dimwitted, tells him to get one out of &quot;used parts&quot;-ie a car out of my sight.  
After that, I had occasional problems of the car stopping while I was driving it, but it always turned back on.  It did overheat twice, but I found a good mechanic (NOT with Pontiac) who fixed things quickly, cheaply, and honestly.
I got rid of it in April of 2000.  The sad thing is, despite the problems with the car, I would have at least considered buying another Grand Am if their company was decent.
I had written to the dealership about the problems I had with the mechanics, and this lady called me and said that things like that shouldn't happen and that the owner or manager or someone would contact me.  He didn't, and I tried to get a hold of him once after that, but I never could so I gave up.
A friend of my parents, who also had a Pontiac product with a defective paint job (who had a year (I think 1994) they would repaint for free) went
a dealership in Houston to get the free paint job.  They tried everything to not do it.  They said they were busy and to come back later (after the window for free painting was closed), they tried to date the work order wrong, etc.  
While this is not certain proof, I tend to think Pontiac (and maybe GM), are organizations that do not have any interest in customer service.  And their cars aren't so wonderful that I'm going to overlook the repeated, terrible experiences I've had with them.  My Grand Am only lasted for 74,000 miles, which is not that many. The Toyota dealership told me the engine was smoking, so it did not have long to go...<br><br>
