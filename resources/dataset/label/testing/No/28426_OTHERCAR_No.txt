            A warning to everyone.....DO NOT BUY A KIA!!!  I have had nothing but problems with my car since I purchased it in August of 1997.  When I purchased the vehicle (1996 Kia Sephia LS), I had NO idea what I was about to get myself into.  Within 2 weeks of purchasing the vehicle, it was in the shop having work done 3 times!!  And, there was only 2600 miles on it at time of purchase!  I later was denied service by the Kia dealership in Vallejo, CA (Lincoln, Mercury, Audi, Kia).  They refused to work on my car telling me to take it elsewhere as I was no longer welcome in there office.  I was completely amazed at the service I was given and reported it to the manager.  NOTHING was done.  So, to make a long story short, my electrical system is shot, I have had work done on the fuel hoses 4 times,  my car tends not to start atleast 1-2 times a week, and NOBODY will take it as a trade in!!  Please take my advise and DON'T buy a Kia!!!<br><br>
