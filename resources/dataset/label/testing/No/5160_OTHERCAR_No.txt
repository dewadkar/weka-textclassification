            I have had my 1992 Dodge Dakota for about 4 years and I would not buy another Dodge truck. When I purchased the truck it had 16000 miles on it and after one week the transmission went.Then about a year or two later I had a leak in the main seal and now I am having trouble with the paint on the vehicle. The roof was the first to start spider cracking then the hood was next and now it is starting on the sides of the bed. When the roof started the Dodge company did split the cost with me and they covered the total cost of the hood, but now there back to 50-50 on the sides.Luckily I did purchase a extended warranty with the vehicle and that helped cover some of my expenses. About the only thing I really like about the truck is that it runs good in the snow and having 4-wheel drive makes that a plus.I really do not think I would by another Dodge Truck.<br><br>
