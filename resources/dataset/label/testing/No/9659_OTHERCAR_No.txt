            Ever since Neons were introduced I've been interested in having one.  I like the body style and the overall performance of the vehicle.  Finally, in December of 1998, I bought a used 1997 Neon Highline four door with the DOHC engine and automatic transmission.  I got an excellent deal on it.  
We've taken this little car all over the place.  We currently live four hours from both of our parents so its quite a trek to go visit and it is nice to be able to have a dependable automobile for the trip.  We've had a small problem with a leak in the coolant department but have fixed that for the time being.  There hasn't really been any other problems with the car.  
The Neon has great acceleration and can keep up with freeway speeds very well.  In fact, there are times it feels like the car wants to go even faster than we're driving it.  
The front and back seats are very roomy.  There is no sloping back windshield to aggravate tall passengers in the back seat and even with the front seats pushed all the way back there still is enough room for even long legs.  We currently have a car seat in the middle of the back seat for my son and even with that we are able to fit two adults on the seats next to the car seat without too much scrunching. 
This car makes a great first vehicle.  Its affordable, gets great gas mileage and is pleasant to own.  I would recommend this any young person who wants to own a car of their own and wants something that isn't going to be a huge financial burden.

Okay, Its been about two years that we've had the Neon and the car is about 5 years old.  In the time since I've written this review, the Neon has fallen into a steep decline.  We've been having trouble with the automatic transmission for the past six months or so.  For the past year and a half we've been having trouble with overheating.  When cold, the Neon won't reverse and is relucatant to switch gears.  When hot, the Neon overheats at the drop of a hat, regardless of fluid.  
We took her in for a tune up in November.  One that cost us $500 from the Dodge dealer and didn't seem to fix anything in particular.  Then this past week the water pump went out.  While we were driving it in fact.  While it was at it, the water pump took out the timing belt so the car wouldn't even start.  We took it into a shop and it cost us a grand total of $600 to get it fixed.  We'd been thinking of getting a new car to replace my husband's pickup but with all the money we've been paying out lately, it doesn't look like its going to happen.  My husband was interested in getting a Dodge Caravan, but now we're not so sure.  If we're going to spend that much money, we'd rather get something from a more reliable manufacturer.
