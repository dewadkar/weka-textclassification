            I bought my S-10 pickup new and for a small-sized truck, it goes just about anywhere.  Chevrolet says that it won't need a tune-up until it reaches 100,000 miles.  They're probably correct in that assumption.  However, they didn't mention that I would need 3 fuel pumps before it reached 100,000 miles.  Nor did they mention that once I got it paid off (after 4 years) it would just fail to start one morning and a new fuel pump nor a new computer would get it going again.  My husband, who is a mechanic, talked to the local Chevrolet garage and explained that after carefully checking all the possibilities in the relays, fuel pump, and ignition, it still failed to start.  They suggested the only thing left was the computer, but after investing over $200 in a new computer (that was the price after trading in the old computer) my truck still sits in my driveway.  What does the Chevrolet garage say?  Heck, they have no idea.  So I'm trying to decide what to use my truck for...the truck that is finally mine after I made the final payment last month....the truck of which I should be a PROUD owner....
A planter would be nice, but I doubt it would fit in my flower bed.  Even if Chevrolet is able to get it started, I would never keep it for lack of being able to depend on it.  Would I ever buy another Chevrolet truck?  NO.  What's the point in buying something when the company you buy it from doesn't know how to fix it?  Don't get me wrong....I liked the truck while it was running.  Perhaps the best thing to do if you're thinking about buying an S-10 is to lease it for a 5 year term...that way you haven't invested the full purchase price into it, and once it dies, it's someone else's problem.  <br><br>
