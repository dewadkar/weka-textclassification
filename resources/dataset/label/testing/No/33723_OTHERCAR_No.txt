            I bought a 1996 Mystique about 4 years ago. It truly drove like a dream. The suspension, and handling were great, but other than that I was truly let down. Here are the reasons why: 

1. Where I live, my windshield gets foggy a lot, and instead of just turning on the defogger, and having it disappear, I have to set the right temperature. It won't get rid of the fog unless you have the correct temperature setting - even then it takes about 5 minutes to clear the whole windshield.

***2. This car has had more recalls than Liz Taylor has had husbands. There was one recall to fix the headlamp, and another one to fix a wire that could catch on fire, and blow up the car. There are so many more, that I'm not going to even bother listing the rest of them. Thankfully, all the recalls are paid for by Ford - how nice of them!

3. I've brought this car to the mechanic tons of times. I even bothered to spend $1700 to get something fixed with my engine. Now I've got transmission fluid leaking, and my mechanic is telling me that I have to get a brand new transmission for $2000! That's why I'm getting a new car soon.

So, if you want a car that rides well, but is always requiring upkeep, go by a Mercury Mystique. I'm sure you'll love it!!!
