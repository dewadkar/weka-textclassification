            The Canon PowerShot A50 is an interesting case in contrasts.  It does some things very well and other things very poorly. 

I have the opportunity to test a lot of electronics in my position and I see a lot of digital cameras.  I couldn't believe how compact the A50 is. It measures 4.1 by 2.7 by 1.5 inches.  Immediately you can see the advantages of this camera for the person who travels and wants to get basic digital photos without having to lug around a large camera.  It barely takes up any space at all.  It's also very easy to use.  

The 1.31-megapixel A50 has a zoom lens and takes photos at resolutions of 1,280 by 960 and 640 by 480 pixels.  It is equipped with a 2-inch LCD display. Its photos can also be viewed on a standard TV thanks to its NTSC video out.  To downloaded photos to the PC you use a serial cable connection. Features include red-eye flash, a macro setting, manual white balance adjustment, Continuous Photo mode, and Slow shutter-speed mode. 

With its impressive size and easy controls, the A50 takes great outdoor shots.  The colors it captured were vivid and crisp.  However, when I attempted to duplicate that success inside I ran into problems.  The pictures I took indoors were dark and almost blurry.  Since much of my photos are shot indoors, I was disappointed.

On the plus side, the package came with a good software bundle.  It includes PhotoStitch (for stitching together photos to create a panoramic picture), SlideShowMaker, TimeTunnel 2.4, Ulead PhotoImpact 4.2, and Adobe's PhotoDeluxe.

Also beware of the battery.  The camera comes standard with a lithium battery, but it seemed to drain quickly.  Don't expect to get much more than 650-680 pictures out of it before you have to replace it.  You might want to consider getting the rechargeable battery and AC adapter for this camera.

If you are looking for a traveling camera to use when snapping shots of the great outdoors, then this camera will do you well.  However, if you plan to be shooting a lot of indoor shots, keep looking!<br><br>
