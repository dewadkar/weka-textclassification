            I don't have owner experience with this minivan, but we test drove it for a week when we rented it on vacation.  It's got its good points and bad points, and I have to say that, for me, the bad outweighs the good.

THE THINGS I LIKED

I realize that rentals don't come with all the bells and whistles that can be purchased on the minivan, so I assume that these features are all standard items.

The sliding doors on each side of the van make it much easier to get kids in and out.  The middle seat, in addition to the rear seat, flips down for extra room and can also be taken out for carrying cargo.  I like the child restraints built into one side of the middle seat.  Both my kids still ride in toddler seats, but we only brought one with us (we visited my sister who has an extra seat we always use).  So we had a seat already installed in the van and didn't have to bother with loading up the one we brought along.

I also greatly enjoyed the dual a/c with vents in the ceiling of the van, between the middle and rear seats.  Four vents in the back provided ample cooling power, in addition to alot of air going on in the front (more info in the DOWN SIDE part of this review).  It had a nice tape/cd stereo, with good sound throughout the van.  The controls on the steering wheel make tuning and volume control easier to do while driving.

The back of the van had tons of storage space!  There was plenty of space for the two full sized suitcases, two  duffle bags, a carry-on, a diaper bag, kid's backpacks, extra carseat and a stroller.  Who would have thought that just one adult and two toddlers needed all that stuff, but we did.

Steering and shifting are very easy in the Montana.  My sister thought the shifting was a bit too easy, but I've got a van that doesn't shift that easily, and when I got out (thinking I'd put it in park) it started rolling forward.  SCARY!  The dash controls are all easily found and reachable when driving.  There are also about 10 cupholders in various places around the van, although there isn't one easily accessible to the passenger riding in the middle seat on the driver's side.

Gas mileage is pretty good, I guess.  We drove all over creation and back and I only had to fill the tank once, which took about $15 at $1.25/gallon.

THE DOWN SIDE:

There may be fewer cons than pros to this minivan, but they were biggies in my opinion, and enough reasons for me not to want to buy this model unless improvements are made.

Although the sliding doors have a groove that the wheel can &quot;catch&quot; to hold it open, the doors come loose often and slide forward quickly and without notice.  The slightest incline is enough to get them moving.  There were several times just during our usage of this minivan, that body parts were pinched in the doors.  Thankfully it wasn't a child that got it.  Who wants to spend their vacation in the emergency room?

The rear door is on a hydraulic hinge, and propels itself upward quickly.  Watch out for any heads that might be in harms way.  On the other hand, it is very difficult to pull down to close, even with a loop handle.  I don't want to strain that much just to close the door.  That's what workouts are for.  (BTW, I didn't go work out on vacation.  I was too sore from trying to get that door down.)

The a/c is a little on the temperamental side.  It's either freezing your butt off or not cooling at all.  There's no real middle ground.  We were constantly back and forth on the temperature control.

The seats are pretty comfy, unless you happen to plop your behind down onto the lock of the seat belt.  The thing sticks straight up out of the seat, doesn't move at all.  To make your bruises worse the lever which moves the seatback up and down  also sticks straight up out of the seat, directly behind the latch to the seat belt, which makes the seat belt even harder to avoid sitting on.  Latching and unlatching the belts themselves proved a little testy, except for my two-year old.

All things considered, I'd have to give this vehicle a 3-star rate because there are so many things I liked about it.  And my dislikes might not be as important to someone else.  At least ours didn't catch on fire.
