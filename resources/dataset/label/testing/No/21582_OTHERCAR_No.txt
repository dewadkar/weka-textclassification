            When I first saw these cars I fell in LOVE.  It was SOOOO beautiful.  It drove like a dream, handled like a race car.  Thought I was in heaven, and then the HELL started.  

I started out with an Eagle Vision (Which is the same as a Dodge Intrepid, with just a little more class).  I leased the car and when my lease was up, I saw a Purple Dodge Intrepid that really caught my eye.  I already knew that there was trouble with them, but I had leased a 93 Eagle Vision and I figured they must have had the bugs worked out by 95.  Boy was I WRONG.  At least I had the fore site to buy the extended warranty.  Which we have used and used and used!  Couldn't tell you how many times we had the air conditioner fixed, probably at least 5 times. 

 My purple lemon also has a new transmission.  I would have to go dig out my very thick file to mention everything that has gone wrong, but just believe me, it was plenty.  Finally got fed up and bought a Toyota 4-runner (95).  Had it for 5 months, and not one problem. 

 My purple lemon is sitting in front of my house with a 4 sale sign on it.  Has been in the paper numerous times over the past 5 months.  I cant GIVE it away.  I am really going to take a bath on this one.  It even has two years left on the warranty and NO BITES!  I guess the word is out about these cars.  

Please don't even think about buying one before 1998.  Now every time I see an Intrepid, I start to HISS.  Every time I see their windows down, I know that their Air Conditioner is on the Fritz.  They are beautiful, but they are JUNK! <br><br>
