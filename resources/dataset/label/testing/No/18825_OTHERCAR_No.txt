            First of all I would just like to say that this thing is a big piece of   #$%@. My Jeep was sold to me buy a friend of mine for $15000 (he was leaving the country and needed the money). A very good price that I could not pass up. I got a loan and bought it(big mistake). The Cherokee was like new with only 8400 miles when I bought it, so I didn't mind the little things that were wrong with it, like the Jeep losing traction when the road was wet. A thing I think is cheap about this SUV is that everything inside of it is ugly and cheap. On top of that the SUV is the smallest piece of #$%@ I had ever driven. I drive a 1998 Ford Expedition at work and man oh man, that is much better. I should have bought one of those. The one thing I like about the Jeep is that it has pretty good acceleration off the line and a fare top speed(like I would ever drive fast in this thing). The Jeep is very, and I mean very scary at high speeds, it always wonders off to the side and it shakes like theres no tomorrow, so if you don't pay 100% attention you will go off the road. All I want to say is if you want an SUV, then get something else like a Chevy Blazer or a Ford Explorer and don't waste your money on a piece of S-H-I-T like this one!!!<br><br>
