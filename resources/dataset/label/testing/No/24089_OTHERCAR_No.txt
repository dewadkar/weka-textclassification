            About six months ago I was browsing around online auctions and I found a digital camera for under $100 I thought at first that I�ve discovered gold but after receiving the unit I learned once again that �you get what you pay for�.

The number one (and probably the only) advantage you have with the camera is the price, for around $100 you get the camera, battery (which is not rechargeable), power cable, computer connection cable and some software, it comes with no real manual.

It doesn�t have a battery life indicator, which almost ruined our last vacation when all of a sudden at about 300 miles away from home it stopped flashing, at first we thought that something was wrong with the flash but after a couple of hours it stopped working completely.

I had to do a lot of research to locate a dealer that would sell me additional memory cards, the original two-MB card can only hold 8-10 �fine� pictures and although it hold more �standard� snaps, it�s a waste of time because the quality of the �standard� is so bad.

In summery, if this is the first time you are looking into the �digital camera� field it might be worth the small investment and it's so light that you might forget that you are holding the camera in your hand but make sure you have at least a couple of extra memory cards and an extra battery when you leave town. <br><br>
