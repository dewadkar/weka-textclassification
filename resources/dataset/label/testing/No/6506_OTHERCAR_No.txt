            I have recently begun using this camera for work. I have used several other digital cameras over the past couple of years, and I'm afraid this one has impressed me least.

Although it is lightweight, it also feels rather flimsy and likely to break. While the integrated lens cover is good, the slide button feels like it'll break off or jam (the latter has happened once so far).

The resolution is better than some other cameras I have used - although it is far from exceptional these days. However, the lack of a decent optical zoom in some ways diminishes the usefulness of the higher resolution.

The picture quality is OK, but it has struggled in strong light and on closeups.

The LCD screen is very small, and if you try to adjust it, the image just seems very overexposed.

The menu system is fairly good and straightforward.

My biggest problems with the camera have been that I have lost a couple of pictures, and the file-naming is not working correctly: once pictures have been deleted they restart at DCP_0002. I have the latest firmware and I am using the internal memory, so I'm unclear what's wrong. I'll try to reformat the memory, but the damage has already been done - I can't get those pictures back (luckily they weren't that important).

The lack of a dc-incput is a problem too, as I don't have any of the extra kits or docking stations. I have a nice rechargeable battery, but no recharger! However, the battery life has been pretty good so far.

The viewfinder really sucks - other than the approximate area your targetting, it doesn't represent the final shot at all well. You can try to use the LCD (if the sun isn't too bright), but that'll eat your batteries...

My only other gripe is the inclusion of the video feature. I found this a pretty cool idea a couple of years ago, but this is a cheap camera, missing some important features - why include the ability to take poor quality video clips?

I guess if you want a step up from the bottom of the line, or want the benefits of digital (I still think a $50 35mm camera will take a way better picture) then it's worth thinking about. However, I think there are much better cameras out there for about the same price or less than $100 more.
