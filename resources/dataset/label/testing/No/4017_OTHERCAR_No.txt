                 I bought a 1991 Hombre, my first &quot;new&quot; vehicle because I wanted something cheap (4 wheels and an engine) with fairly good mileage and a warranty (and wanted to be able to haul).  That truck served me very well.  I put over 140,000 miles on it in 4 years.  The finish was dull when I traded it in but otherwise it was still a great little truck.  I also owned a 1993 Rodeo and found it to be wonderful reliable vehicle.
     I then bought a 1997 Hombre at the beginning of the 98 model year.  With the styling changes the GM influence is obvious.  My opinion of Isuzu has gone downhill since then.  The 97 cost twice as much as the 91 and isn't 1/2 the truck.  Its underpowered (both had 4 cyl engines) and the suspension is much softer.  Mechanically it has given me nothing but trouble.  Clutch, engine, and non-mechanical parts have all needed service.  The spare tire carrier (a cable and nut system) broke, luckily it was while the truck was parked and not at freeway speeds.  The seat frame had a sharp edge that poked up through the seat cover (ruined 2 pairs of pants) and I finally noticed it when it tore a hole in the seat cover.  Service engine light comes on but the dealer can't find anything wrong so just resets it.
     The last time I took the truck to the dealer for service they left the inside of the truck filthy (and cash was taken out of the ashtray) so I wrote the dealer and Isuzu letters.  Isuzu called and said they had received the letter and would refer it to the dealer for follow up.  Still haven't heard from the dealer.  They also didn't fix the clutch, so now I'm adding fluid so I can shift.  The engine sounds like its about to throw a rod and has no power.  In 35,000 miles I have had 1000 percent more problems with this truck than in the 140,000 miles I had with the 1991 Hombre and the 104,000 miles on the 1993 Rodeo combined.

I went to a dealer 40 miles from my home to buy this truck because I was so impressed with my other Isuzus, but I wouldn't go 40 feet to get another one.<br><br>
