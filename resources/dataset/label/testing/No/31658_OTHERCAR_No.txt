            This is my opinion of my 1994 Mercury Cougar XR7.  I love this car.  I bought this car because of it's sporty look and great handling.  This car has a pretty tight steering wheel which is good for quick reaction.  The car has rear possi which is good for traction.  Most Cougars come with a V6 3.8 liter engine like mine.  The car has pretty good pick-up and gets good gas milage.  It has an 18 gallon tank and gets about 20 miles to the gallon.  I love how the car sits low to the ground and handles well.  It is a safe car with two air bags.  Since it is low to the ground it is not as likely to tip over.  The only thing bad about this car is the factory installed radio.  The radio does not sound very good at all.  It has bose speakers but just not a good enough radio.  This is easily reparible though.  I have recently installed a Pioneer 150 watt cd player in it.  I also have two ten inch JBL subwoofers with a Sony XM 140 watt 2 channel amp.  With the cd player and the subs the speakers sound a lot better.  I think this car is for people ages 16 to 30.  This car has all of your basic needs and wants.  From the luxurious look to the sporty handling.  In my opinion this is a great car.<br><br>
