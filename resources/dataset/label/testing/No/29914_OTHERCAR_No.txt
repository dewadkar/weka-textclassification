            I bought a 1996 Sunfire Base 2-Door after my Grand Am with 120k+ miles on it finally died. It was a program car with 8k on it. Thought I got a good deal but little did I know. At 12k the ball joints needed replaced, 22k the transmission was rebuild since it was slipping, the final major problem was at 35k the head gasket blew! This was the one that sent me over the edge since the car was now out of warranty. I changed the gasket myself and promptly traded it in only to find out that it is one of the fastest depreciating cars out there!!! With it being 2 yrs old with 35k on it and in nice shape the best I was able to get on trade-in was 7,500 (less than what I owed on it) The car overall in handling and acceleration wasn't too bad. The engine lack power for merging and the dash seemed to have constant rattles that the dealership couldn't find. I would not advise anyone to purchase one of these. I ended up getting a 97 Thunderbird LX and now have 80k on it with no problems what so ever except routine maint.<br><br>
