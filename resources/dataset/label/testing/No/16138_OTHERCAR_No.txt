            Front rotors have been replaced twice. So, including the factory set, I'm on my 3rd set. Cruise control didn't work when I got the vehicle. The cruise control 'Servo' had to be replaced. Actually, when I first talked to the service department about the cruise control, she said, and I quote, "The cruise control in all Chrysler products typically don't work on hills". So I responded, "So, Chrysler has created a cruise control system that only works on flat surfaces". She says, "Yes, for the most part". Now, at this point I had a tough time containing myself, not to mention the guy standing in line behind me. I really was speechless. But, I basically ignored her comments for the time being and just said, "Book it in". Sure enough it was pooched. A brilliant mind she was. Anyways, back to the topic at hand, Mechanically the vehicle was assembled by an infant. Or the parts themselves we're manufactured by an infant. Either way, its' worse than the 78' Toyota Celica I drove when I was 16. The guy in the service department actually was laughing about how often the Front Rotors have been replaced, while I was busy laughing at his hairpiece doing 'The Jig' on his melon. Anyways, the 1st set of Rotors was replaced at 18,000 km along with Pads, all of which was just barely covered under warranty, so on went set 2. The 2nd set was replaced just a week ago at 27,300 km, so on with the 3rd set. So, here I am, at 27301 Km wondering how far I'll have to bendover to take it in the *ss, just so I can get rid of this P.O.S. Chrysler produces garbage, at least their consistent Eh!!!!
