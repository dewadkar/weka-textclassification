            I recently was "upgraded" from a Camry to a Liberty for a two-week long business trip during which I drove the Jeep for 2000 miles.  I was at first very excited to drive the Jeep; I saw it as a nice break from soul-less mid-sized rental cars and figured that it would be a lot of fun.  I came away very disappointed.

First, I'll say that the Liberty (mine was black on black) looks very cool.  I like it's high, boxy stance and it's very unique front end--reminds one of old Jeep CJs and Wranglers yet with a modern take.  The Jeep easily accommodated all my stuff.  The Liberty scoots pretty well off the line, but the transmission could use better ratios.  Shifting from 2nd to 3rd under hard acceleration on the freeway made the jeep go from pulling strong at 4000 rpm to being bogged down at 2600, ruining an otherwise solid and smooth merge.  Around town, the Liberty was better and was sprightly.  

Once the driving began, though, my positive first impressions got worse.  The seat was very uncomfortable, with little lumbar support and no lateral support.  Worse, the integrated headrest was awful; my neck had no support at all and was very sore after even short drives.  I had a few 8-hour driving days and the pain after one of those marathon driving sessions was unbearable.  My neck pain found company in the migraine-esque headaches I got from day-long driving in the Liberty.  The engine's roar at 80 mph, itself significant, was dwarfed by the truly tortuous amount of road noise.  It deserves to be said that my rental Liberty (only 12000 miles) was a Sport model and therefore had more aggressive off-road tires.  I understand that Limited models have more road-friendly rubber.  Regardless, mine was exceedingly loud on the highway, so much so that I hated even the thought of another long night on the road.  The decent stereo system and CD player did an admirable job drowning out all that road noise, but even the blaring stereo system was no match.  If you want a Liberty for town use, then you might be happy with it but I would heartily recommend against it for long trips.  And speaking of long trips, I averaged 17-18 MPG for my freeway trips, and even less in town.  Disappointing.

I have no doubt that, with lots of under-chassis space and those knobby tires, along with a low-range 4WD system (unavailable in many other small 'utes, the Jeep is excellent off-road.  I see that as its only real virtue in the competitive marketplace, though.  The Liberty was too loud, too uncomfortable, and too thirsty to make it a good choice in my opinion.  CR-Vs, Escapes and Santa Fes would be smarter on-road choices.
