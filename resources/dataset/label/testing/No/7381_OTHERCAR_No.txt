            REVISED OPENING -- This is an honest review from an actual owner of 1 year's time.  This was not written with any bias towards other cars, no intent of offending current owners.  This an actual account of my ownership experience.  I, like many other Epinion.com readers, spent a great deal of time reading about the new WRX prior to purchasing it.  All of the great reviews mixed in with 7 years of waiting for Subaru to bring the car to the states convinced me to buy.  When everything is working -- what a blast to drive.  Otherwise, your money may be better spent elsewhere.

I purchased my 02 WRX in June of 2001.  In less than two months I had to return it to the dealer for the "Check Engine" light staying on.  It lit up during normal driving and made a chirping sound in the exhaust note.  This is with no mods and normal driving (was waiting to break the car in.)  The dealer said the computer failed and took a week to replace it.  $26k with options and dead computer in two months?  Shortly after getting it back I noticed a creaking sound in the front left strut.  I took it back and the dealer gave it a green light.  ALL dealer appointments from the start of the third month on was with the Subaru Regional Representative - Hanz something.  No help whatsoever.  The creaking in the strut became louder and by month 4 I had to get the entire front suspension replaced.  Prior to replacing the suspension, I requested a trade under the California Lemon Law.  The dealer was absolutely not hearing that.  After attempting to fix the creaking suspension on FOUR visits, they finally did the full replacement on the FIFTH trip there.  And that was only after being pressured by me.  I also had to get the front defrost disassembled and reassembled to remove some rattling sounds.  TWICE.

The driver's window leaked and was repaired three times.  The passenger side had it twice.  Both driver's and passenger windows squeaked when rolling up and down -- both repaired twice.  The front passenger door had some loose rod that would intermittently make a tapping sound when driving on the freeway.  Like a loud metal tapping.  All of these happened at different times.

To make matters worse, after all of these problems were fixed, the front dash (next to where the VIN is) started rattling.  The only way to get rid of that was to hold the cheap plastic in place.  The driver's seat would appear to lock into position when sliding back and forth.  However, almost every time, the thing would pop into its final resting position after a little driving!  If I moved in the driver's seat you could hear creaking springs, really bad.  Service techs said it was "working as designed."  I've owned 8 cars, three of them performance, and none of them were "designed" to work that way.  In the first 6 months of ownership of this car I had to have it back for service once every 2.7 weeks.  That is ridiculous, and certainly not worth the money paid for this vehicle.

I have to say that on paper this car is very impressive, and when working properly, it is exciting to drive.  BUT, for the money it is absolutely not worth what you have to deal with.  Maybe others have been lucky, but I really take care of my cars and this was a constant headache.  After one year I finally gave up on it and traded it in on the 2002 Sentra SE-R Spec V.  I took huge loss in value on the deal because the WRX's were not selling well and they apparently hold their value as well as water in a strainer.  This is per multiple dealers telling me they could not get them off their lots.

If money is important to you, or if a quality machine is important, please read my review of my new Spec V.  Go to the AUTO section here on epinions.com and search for Sentra.  My author name is Bruce_Lee_Fan.  I truly hope this review educates somebody before he/she makes a decision they end up regretting.  Thanks for reading.
