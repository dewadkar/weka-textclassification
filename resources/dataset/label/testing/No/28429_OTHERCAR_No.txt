            I Purchase a KIA Sephia on March 1996. Since Then I had the dashboard replaced. The check engine light came on after only 200 mile and was in the shop for 2 days so they could figure out what was wrong. Window Seal replaced and you can still hear wind come in. The Speakers After a year had to be replaced.  Got a Flat tire at approx. 45 miles and the tired dented the fender on the card. This is the same material that suppose to protect my family i think NOT. The Fuel Gage had also had to be replaced. i finally got tired and demanded a different car . and the other car the dealer gave me i have had the same problem. I WILL NEVER BUY A KA AGAIN.<br><br>
