            The 1999 Concorde LXi is a great car.  It has plenty of room, its very comfortable, and the stylish appearance  turns heads.  It has a great sound system, a smooth powerful drive chain, and excellent fuel economy.  What more could you ask for?

Improved Reliability!  I've purchased the car new in August, 1999, and in the past three years, (and 63,000 miles) I've encountered the following issues:

1.  About every two months, I back out my garage and put the car into Drive - and nothing happens.  The engine revs and I go nowhere.  I shift between gears and can only go backwards.  After a minute or two, the transmission finally shifts to Drive and everything's fine for another couple of months.  I've had this issue serviced by the dealer twice - they changed my transmission fluid and filter twice, and they "reset the program" on the transmission once, but I still have the problem. 

2.  At about 42,000 miles, I left home and the car would not shift out of first gear.  I limped to the dealer at 15 mph.  It turned out that the transmission was fine, but a sensor that monitors wheel speed had gone bad.  The repair cost me nearly $200.

3.  At about 52,000 miles, an occasional very loud noise started under my hood.  The bearings in one of the two fan motors that cool the radiator had gone bad.  The mechanic said it was in danger of locking up and needed to be replaced.  Later that day, the dealer called to tell me the part was only available as a unit, which included a frame, two motors and two fan blades - a $550 part.  I had to recover the car from the dealer and find a local mechanic who secured the motor alone and fixed it for $150.

4.  At about 55,000 miles, the power lock on my drivers door stopped working.  At 55,500 miles it worked again.  At 56,000 miles it stopped working - and this cycle continues.  I don't know if it's the lock unit or the wiring.  My mechanic says Concorde doors involve quite a bit of labor to service and I'm looking at a $150-$200 repair.

5.  At about 55,000 miles, my AC began putting out "cool mist" from the vents in addition to cool air.  At about 60,000 miles, my AC stopped working.  It needed a recharge which cost me $50.  It appears the AC system has developed a small leak - that will cost me more $$$ to track down and fix.

6.  At about 60,000 miles, the dash board LCD lights (radio, odometer, etc.) began flickering from dim to bright occasionally regardless of how the switch is set.  In addition, the fan speed now occasionally changes even when the system is set in manual mode.  It looks like I have some sort of electrical problem - more $$$.

I'm thinking it's time to trade - even though I like the car and had planned to keep it for five years.  These little things erode your confidence, and I'm afraid I might face a big repair bill soon!

It's a shame - it's such a great car in between the problems.  My wife purchased a new Toyota minivan the same month I bought the Concorde.  At 50,000 miles, the Toyota has never been back to the dealer.  Looks like I'm learning a lesson about the reliability of American made cars vs. their Japanese counterparts.
