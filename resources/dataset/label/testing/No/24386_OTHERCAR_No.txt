<TEXT>
            We bought a 1996 Kia Sportage in May of 1998, with 33,000 miles on it.  By December of 98, not only did we end up having to replace the engine but we found out nothing was covered under the warranty despite not even being to 40,000 miles.
  Apparently the radiator, which was made of plastic and not covered, can split open and the water will drain our so quickly that as you overheat it will only show up on the temperature gauge for a few moments, as the heat is measured through the water temperature.
  We had just had an oil change a check up, then took a trip to a road trip for the day, a by the next morning ended up with a broken down vehicle.  Even after having the new engine put in we still have problems with the door ajar sounds going off for no reason and batteries being drained despite having it in the shop over and over.
  It also does not hold any value at all and despite being in perfect condition otherwise we have been unable to sell.  We have gotten the run around from the dealership we bought it from and from Kia. We recommend that you do not buy this vehicle of any year without a very long warranty that covers all parts. <br><br>
