            I purchased the '93 Pontiac Sunbird in 1995; at the time it had 60k miles on it.  When we checked it over prior to purchasing, it was in really good condition.  Since that time, it has been pretty reliable...it's driven me to and from Modesto several times (approximately 3 hour drive) as well as to and from the Los Angeles area once.  I've been pretty good about routine maintenance, and now, with 114k miles on it, this car is experiencing some problems that you may want to consider prior to purchasing.

The biggest and most persistent issue involves the wiring to the starter.  I don't know much about cars, so I can't explain it in technical terms, but essentially what I understand is that the wiring that goes to the starter is placed very close to the exhaust manifold.  As a result, the wires burn and melt, causing everything from the battery light to flicker, to complete loss of power.  Since 1998, I have experienced this problem four times.  The first time, the car totally died, beginning with flickering headlights, a dying radio and gradually putt putting to a stop in a parking lot.

Within the last two months, I've had to invest $1500 to have a head gasket repaired (along with related issues), a starter fuse replaced (the wiring issue I was talking about) and then had to take the car back a week later for the same wiring job.  I've been told that the issue with the wiring "should" be ok now, because they used a thicker wire.  Please be sure to have this issue checked by a reliable mechanic before purchasing this car.
