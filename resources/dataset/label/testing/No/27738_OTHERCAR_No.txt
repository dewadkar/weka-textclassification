            <b> Not Recommended for Giants </b>
The small features items tend to be tough to see on the LCD screen. Negative is that small size can make controls cumbersome for large fingered person.

<b> Size Matters </b>
The best feature of the camera I think is the size. It is so small you can comfortably fit it in your pocket. 

<b> USB Interface Cons</b>
Easy and fast USB interface that makes downloading these high resolution pictures a breeze. The camera connects to your computer, in order to offload the images, through a USB port. 
<b> USB Interface Problems! </b>
The USB driver is incompatible with USB hubs and can NOT co-exist with other USB devices. (this is announced during the driver installation procedure) However, the installation procedure requires use of a CD ROM drive, which in my case is a USB device, as are my mouse and keyboard. Remember, USB does not work with Windows NT 4.0!

<b> Need to buy MORE storage space </b>
One limitation is the 8MB of storage so you need to get a larger card.

<b> Stitch Mode is Fun </b>
A really cool thing is the stitch mode that lets you take a series of pictures and stitch them together into a longer panoramic picture. 

<b> ZOOM goes BOOM!</b>
Inability of the Canon to zoom much, so you often need to crop the image down. The only thing I don't like about it is the Digital Zoom. If you go in to far it becomes to grainy. 

<b> Awesome Metal Frame </b>
Dropped it on the sidewalk and the steel case (rare to find on a digital camera) kept it from breaking! This thing is built like a tank. It's <b> ALL METAL. </b>

<b> Battery Life - Yes you will need to buy more </b>
Battery life is approx 30-60 shots avg and it charges in under 2 hours An extra battery is a good option.. The only bad thing is the short battery life.

<b> Pricey Protective Cases </b>
I found the (somewhat) pricey weatherproof/underwater (to 9.8 feet) protective case to be a surprisingly useful accessory for taking pictures while on the river kayaking or underwater snorkeling.
