            The Volvo XC90 has, like all Volvos, a truly horrible name. It baffles me that people as nice as the Swedes &#150 forward looking, neutral, sauna inhabiting, high living socialists that they are &#150 couldn&#146t come up with something more friendly than XC90. I know that it&#146s probably code for enormous Volvo SUV that looks like a great big car (rather than a box on wheels) and goes like stink but I don&#146t like it. It&#146s just not blonde enough. Volvos should be called things like Sven or Agneta. But enough of my inane rambling and into the review proper.

The Volvo XC90 is of course about as Swedish as Bruce Springstein. Conceived in America for America roads, American wallets and American sensibilities it is in fact a posh Ford. No doubt the Swedes were conned into selling to the Blue Oval, a misunderstanding involving a cell phone with poor reception, a Fjord 2 hrs outside of Stockholm and a half gallon of inexplicably expensive Vodka. But sold they were and since then the pressure has been on to produce an SUV.

Of course the SUV should have been a Volvo concept, Forever the masters of the utilitarian over the sexy, the safe over the breath-taking and the roomy (remember those huge wagons?) over the sensible (how many people really shifted furniture THAT often) Volvo should have cleaned up in what the UK calls the &#145Grass &#145n&#146 Gravel&#146 market &#150 allowing its owners to scamper across verges and up long driveways with not a whimper of complaint. Alas the Volvo bank account resembled that of Mike Tyson and so the never got around to developing the car that could define them, until Ford came along, dipped deeper into debt and provided a much needed injection of cash.

A totally free-hand of course was not granted &#150 Volvo is now as much a part of the re-engineered platform world as any manufacturer and thus the XC90 sits on a platform developed for the S80. Volvo imaginatively called this platform the E2 &#150 oh to be in their &#145namestorms&#146, huh? What this does is give the XC90 very car like proportions. Or at least it looks as though it has car like proportions. It is in fact much bigger than it looks. Much, much bigger. Imagine bumping in to Garly Coleman and realizing that he could have a shot at the NBA. A shock, right. Not as much of a shock as the Volvo&#146s proportions.  Whilst it shares length and width with the S80 it&#146s a full 14 inches taller. A riot of headroom. Of course what those extra inches give is the appearance of ground clearance and that high driving position that invokes in us all a feeling of imperiousness.

So let&#146s start by walking around the car. It looks like, well, it looks like a great big Volvo. It&#146s very slabby, very angular and has that Swedish aversion to curves that has been the marque&#146s signature. From the rear the tail lights absolutely dominate, erupting into huge pillars that seem to make up the entire rear pillars and threaten a Vegas like explosion of light should you set foot on break. There&#146s lots of matt black plastic as &#145skirting&#146 &#150 no doubt in a bid to establish &#145off road credentials&#146 &#150 clean they look a little tacky, but get some mud splashes going and they seem to blend in to the overall design well. The rear spilts 70-30 but seems a little high, necessitating a bend of the knees as you load up the groceries.

Inside things are a step up from the usual Volvo blandness. There&#146s lots of light colors, adding to airiness. There&#146s wood that looks like wood and fake aluminum that looks like, erm, fake aluminum. The overall effect is pleasing and the car feels built to last. Dash layout is simple to the point of insulting but again feels very Volvo with only four things (speed, distance, temperature and fuel level) outlined. I found the driving position to be excellent if a little bus-like, my wife had more problems, saying that the high wheel and upright position made her feel like a kid behind the wheel of her dad&#146s car. She&#146s 5&#146 4&#148 (I think). She also had problems with the thick pillars restricting vision, something I&#146ve read about but didn&#146t experience myself. Seats are great as you&#146d expect, with the leather adding a real Volvo smell to the mix. Lumbar support is adjustable and excellent as is the whiplash control. There are lots of seats too, three rows of them doing all manner of clever tricks, folding in numerous ways and demanding a degree in applied algebra to quantify their cleverness. You can even make one row disappear entirely. The back row is less than roomy, not ideal for small kids (too far away to reach) and therefore designed exclusively (as far as I can tell) for those annoying 8-10 year olds who want to play &#145rip the arms off expensive future collectables&#146. Still the lay out is fine and dandy and everything feels too well made for a car that is ultimately going to be trashed by the carrying of kids, dogs and elderly relative&#146s furniture.

Start her up and things get even sweeter. Volvo may be know for its 5 cyl engines but the 2.9l 6 cyl engine is just as sweet. 280lbs of torque below 2,000 rpm is good for initial shunt (or pulling that trailer) and with 268 bhp there&#146s plenty of power too. The automatic gearbox does a good job of keeping forward momentum &#150 yes there&#146s a little turbo lag and you&#146re not going to lose many people from he lights but the car pulls and keeps pulling all the way to the redline.

All wheels are driven, giving safe but unremarkable response. You know what the Volvo is going to do &#150 it&#146s safe, it&#146s unremarkable, not overly involving &#150 very Swedish, quite detached and a little cold perhaps but responsive. The car is a pretty relaxing place to be &#150 you waft along, a little too upright but feeling quite unnoticed at speeds slightly faster than you&#146d imagine. We didn&#146t take the car off-road but have heard that it copes okay and that&#146s good enough &#150 you don&#146t buy something this plutocratic to get it dirty down on the farm.

Head quickly into a corner and you&#146re going to feel your lunch rising in your throat &#150 this isn&#146t a taut car by any measure but one &#150 that measure being other SUVs and against those it more than holds its own

Safety of course is a Volvo advantage (though Renault beat them) and this car is no exception. Here are some of the unique safety features (taken from the website), assume that every other safety feature is included &#150 you&#146ll be right

&#149 Roll stability control (ft. gyrosocopic sensoring). It won&#146t roll over then.

&#149 Full length &#145curtain&#146 airbags, protecting every seat

&#149 All seat seatbelt pre-tensioners

&#149 Lower cross members &#150 saving you from &#145mounting&#146 other cars in case of accident

&#149 Pedestrian crumple zones &#150 saving people when you mow them down

&#149 Whiplash protection &#150 the front seats move back in case of impact, saving you whiplash

Pretty safe then.

The Volvo is Swedish in the way it&#146s equipeed however &#150 this car is stacked like a pneumatic blonde &#150 with front and rear controls for the climate control, electric driver&#146s seat, cruise, nice leather, real wood and a CD player good enough to have in your study.


So what did we think about the Volvo. Well like Roxette (another fine Swedish export) it was well put together, very professional and perhaps a little too polished. I like to drive , to feel a car moving fluidly with me and the Volvo didn&#146t really allow me to do that &#150 wallowing through bends when pushed and quietly letting you know that this kind of behavior really isn&#146t on.

And the looks are a bit of a turn off too. It looks exactly as you&#146d expect and American Volvo to look &#150 supersized, Alas it&#146s a look that just doesn&#146t come off.

Of course the Volvo wasn&#146t made for me. It was made for people with children. And dogs. And all the stuff that comes with children and dogs. It was designed to deal with the baggage (physical and emotional), the desperate need for safety above all and the even more desperate need for a little space that having kids brings. That and to look suitably expensive (not to mention expansive) on the lawn. With that in mind this car is a complete success.

Now where did I put those condoms?
