            I bought the first Dodge Stratus off the lot from Crown Dodge in Ventura California in March 1995. I have put almost 50,000 on it since then and have found the vehicle to be very reliable and am happy with the purchase. During the first 6 months of owning the car I did have some ignition problems in that the car would stall at low idle speeds. Dodge actually used the vehicle as a bench-mark after being unable to solve the problem and replaced the whole ignition system. The original system was then sent back to the factory for analysis. The engine in my stratus is the 16 v dohc 2.4 liter, which has a lot of power for a 4 cylinder engine, people always seem to think it's a 6. The only complaint I have are that it seems to go through tires, I'm currently 1/2 way through my third set, and I don't think the gas mileage is that good. I get around 21-22 per gallon overall, I think the original epa estimate was 24 and 28.

I have decided to come back and edit this opinion since after reaching 50,000 this vehicle has become a disaster. First what sounded like a small exhaust leak turned out to be a cracked intake manifold which was eventually replaced at a cost of $1,100. Shortly after that rough running resulted in the need to replaced 3 valves and recondition the cylinder head at a cost of $1,200. 

If you buy one of these vehicles make sure it's not approaching 50,000 miles ! As for me, I will never buy another Chrysler product.   <br><br>
