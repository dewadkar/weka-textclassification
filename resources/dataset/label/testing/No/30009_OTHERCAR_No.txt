            We needed a camera for the college newspaper.  The only one we had was a flip top that took awful pictures when it didn't jam and ruin the film. Since we did not have a working darkroom, a digital seemed like the best bet.  We could preview shots and have them immediately to download and fit in the PageMaker program.

The Kodak DC280 seemed like a good idea since it has won many awards including Photo Techniques "World's Best Cameras," PC Magazine, and CNET "Editors' Choice" pick.  Unfortunately, this was purchased before I knew about Epinions (about a year ago), so we didn't have this space to use for comparison and to get info.
 
The second selling feature that made this camera seem like a good idea was that it is similar to standard 35mm cameras in terms of design and use.  That helps since we have a variety of students taking pictures and new staff members coming on board on a regular basis.

The camera is pretty easy to use (though some students never have figured out the settings).  It works a lot like a regular 35mm although you can get better shots if you play around and adjust settings.  Instructions are easy to follow as far as the basic set up plus the options (though it's hard to get any options figured out when you're in the middle of a photo shoot).

Kodak DC280 was $700 last year and listed at $600 this year (though they are often on sale for around $400). Then you really need to add on with the power cord and more photo cards.

The camera is sturdy and comes with a small wrist strap but no carrying case.  Our camera has been dropped at least 2 times (that I know of) with no damage other than some scuffs on the case.

The lens has a little cord to connect the lens cap to the body of the camera. This is good esp if you lose things (like I do).  The only problem I have with the lens cap is that when you turn the camera on for pictures, then the lens shoots out and the cap falls off automatically.  Maybe this is just how digital camera work, but I just hate that.  Sometimes I am just getting ready for a possible shot. I would rather pop the lens cap myself right before I acutally shoot rather than have it pop open and getting dirty with the dust in the air or maybe my fingers on that while I'm waiting.

The photos are on a Kodak picture card rather than on a 3x5 computer disk.  The camera comes with only one of those photo cards (sizes vary and we unlucked out and got the small capacity size). You can fit around 15 shots on the camera card with the best quality setting.  You can't save right on the spot to a disk and decide later, unless you buy more picture cards and use them like disks (which would be very expensive when those camera cards cost around $50). 

The pre settings are for general purpose shots which is fine. You can go into the menu and add effects like going to black and white (which is nice for newspaper) or borders which would look cheesy in the paper but OK for scrap books.  Generally we just use standard settings.  You can make new settings and then lock those in. The problem is that we have a variety of photographers, so some staff members would have trouble resetting the camera.

You can shoot basically in good, better, or best.   The good or standard is 1901 x 1212 pixels, high or better at 1760 x 1168 pixels, and 896 x 592 pixels for the good (or standard).  We like to shoot in the best pixel range (or I do), but that involves resetting, so most of our pics actually are in the standard.

The downside of the best quality is that it takes up more space on the picture card, so you can't fit many pictures on the Kodak photo card which is inserted in the side.  On the other hand you can get some really good quality pictures which can go up to 8 x 10 and not look digital.  The standard setting is OK and takes pretty good shots. Often these are washed out looking in standard unless the sun angle is just right. We never use the lower resolution as we're looking for print quality rather than shots to put on a web page or to email (where the resolution can be lower without impacting quality--plus loads faster too).

In additon to a regular viewfinder like you have on a standard 35mm, you also have a screen on the back (like with most video cameras these days).  That is a color screen. It's nice not to have your face up to the camera, but the screen is hard to see outside. It catches glares and looks real washed out.  Also, it does not frame up the same way the picture does when you download it. You think you have the shot just perfect, and then you download the picture and have to do extra work to get it right with the photo software.  You're really better off to look through the regular viewfinder hole. 

On the LCD screen . . . it is always open.  Does not have a cover over that.  It is right close to the rubber hand hold. Your left thumb wanders over there.  Then you have finger prints and dirt on the screen.  With several people using the camera (and wonder what they are eating or drinking while taking pics), that is one dirty spot on the camera. I clean that screen frequently, but it is always dirty which makes it even harder to view with that screen.    

The biggest problem is the lag time on the shutter. You frame in the shot and click and it lags a couple of seconds. This may not seem like a big deal, but we often have the person walk right out of the frame before the shot takes.  There is NO WAY that this camera can be used for sports shots where a split second means the ball is down field.  Even with a man cutting trees this week on campus, over half the shots caught him after tha action. 

On the front of the camera you can fill flash to reduce red eye.  Since most of the people are moving that we shoot, we don't even see many eyes (due to the lag time from press to click to take the shot). Fill flash could help with shadows on buildings, but it's easier to just wait for a cloudy day if it's just a still shot like that. You can position people and take the shot, but you can also decide on where to line up people for a still shot and then select a spot with the lighting you need.

On the top you have a toggle zoom (like on a video camera). I would just forget that.  When you make changes then you get real grainy pictures.  It looks like those boxes they put on faces on TV when they don't want you to see the person or if they try to hide body parts.  Those look bad and even worse when they come out in the newspaper.

One nice thing is that the camera does pretty well in low light up close.  The distant shots are a mess unless you go into the program and shut off the flash. The auto flash comes on unless you reprogram, and it works well up close.

The camera works on batteries or you can buy a power cord which does not come with the camera and is not carried at local stores (need to go to the Kodak site and order that and it's expensive).  We need to sell more ads to buy that power cord. This camera eats the batteries.  I average around 8 shots per 4 batteries (but I'm a perfectionist on my shots and have it on and waiting for shots).  I send two extra 4 packs out with any student taking pics.  You can recharge the ones that come with the camera with a wall plug in (that does come with the camera).  But, we're still buying lots of batteries. The main thing we really need the power cord for is the download to the computer.  It's a real shame to eat up the batteries while we're in the office (not the mention all the ones we used up shooting).

The camera does have a power saver. This is good in some ways, but I always find the camera in sleep mode when a good shot opportunity comes up.  We score a touchdown and I want a crowd shot (as I can't even begin to catch the football action with the lag time) and the camera has to be basically rebooted. The crowd in sitting by that time, so I don't get a usable shot.

Once you have the shots, then you go back to the computer. There you have a cable to hook up. It can stay hooked up and just plug into the side of the camera which is easy.  The directions are simple enough to follow. The software comes with the camera.  That is easy to use too and has some good options for cropping and fixing shots. Then you can put into a program like PageMaker or put on regular 3 x 5 disks or email or put on a web page.  The JPEG format is weighty and means about 3 photos per disk though.

Overall, I would not buy this camera if I knew what I know now. It does work fine for still shots especially on cloudy days.  It's fairly easy to use if you stay in the factory settings.  The computer hook up is simple, and the software is good. But there are some major problems.  The big thing is that lag time on the click.  Next would be the battery zapping.  Then the viewfinder is not accurate as far as how the shot looks, so you end up using the small viewfinder on the back.
