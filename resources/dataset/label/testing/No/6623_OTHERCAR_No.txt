            Synopsis:  

We�ve had this 1991 Passat since 1997 used.  The car is great, but it was designed/built before Volkswagen really re-focused on the US market and raised its quality (and prices).  That said, it�s a very good car that deserved better execution.  Still, it�s stylish, handles beautifully, is quite roomy, and has a solid German feel.  

Specs:  

2.0L 16-valve 4-cyl. engine, 4-speed automatic, ABS, automatic seat belts, leather/luxury package with sunroof, alloy wheels, rear spoiler.  

Design/Practicality:  

Its looks are subjective, although everyone seems to like its clean Audi-5000ish profile.  The grille-less snout was probably a bone of contention, since the later model years had a more conventional fa�ade.  Overall, it�s pretty well built and has survived the Wisconsin winters without many squeaks or rattles.  The interior is black leather and those familiar with Audi�s or Volkswagen�s will immediately feel at home in the cockpit with the serious looking buttons and gauges.  Some small plastic pieces have worn down, particularly in �high-traffic� areas such as the shifter and door handles.  The stereo is nice, but under-amplified, making it easy to blow a speaker, and there are no cup holders.  The seats are truly great � firm and typically German with 6 way adjustment and lumbar support.  There is a lot more rear legroom and trunk room than you think; the rear seat folds down, of course.  

Driveability:  

The engine is peppy, but no match for a turbo or a 6-cylinder.  It keeps up well at highway speeds, but around town, there is noticeable lack of lower-end torque.  The transmission offers both �economy� and �sport� modes, but there is little difference.  The steering a bit heavy and feels under-assisted.  Parallel parking can be difficult in tight spots.  Both ride and handling are excellent with a ton of feedback and a predictable amount of understeer.  It feels more neutral than most front-wheel drive cars.  

Quality/Maintenance:  

It�s hit or miss.  The engineering of the major components is great, but the execution is spotty.  Count on replacing or rebuilding the following:  transmission, exhaust, ignition electrics, distributor, and the alternator.  Those things have a history of failing around 100-125K miles, but once replaced should be fine.  Ours has been predictable in that way like clockwork, so that made diagnosis and repair pretty easy (if a bit expensive and annoying).  If you live anywhere but the Southwest or SoCal, there will be rust after a while � tiny patches around the wheel wells.  The body itself remains solid, although the transmission tunnel shakes-and-shivers when cold.  Maintenance is about normal, with reasonable oil consumption and no leaks etc.  

Buying a used one?  

It�s hard not to recommend it because the car has ability to be so fun and great.  It�s nothing like a Camry or the ilk.  But on the other hand, it requires attention and major maintenance.  I can only recommend it if you find a mint-condition model with all the service records that has had the 100K-125K mile problems already fixed.  My gut tells me that it should be good to go for a while then.  If not...<br><br>
