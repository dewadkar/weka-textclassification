            Being known as a "computer geek" and having a love for photography, I've always wondered what took me so long to think about purchasing a digital camera.  Think about it...no film to purchase, no midnight runs to Wal-Mart to drop off endless rolls of film, no waiting for those special family holiday pictures when the "one hour photo" processing ends up taking two days, and the convenience of resizing and adding special effects to any picture you take.  So when I finally realized that I needed a digital camera to add to my electronic "toy" collection, it also happened to be a week prior to Christmas 2000.  So the digital camera was added to my Christmas list from Santa, and I waited like a pouting little child until Christmas Eve when I finally got to open a box, and lo and behold, there was the digital camera, an HP PhotoSmart C215.  I ripped it open, set it up, and proceeded to play with it the rest of the evening like a kid with a shiny new toy, snapping pictures of my family left and right.  But the "playing" didn't last too long....

Sure, the HP PhotoSmart C215 was great while it lasted.  As soon as I took 25-30 pictures that night, I plugged the camera to the computer and began downloading the pictures, after a lengthy download of the photo software that was included with the camera.  The download of the pictures was also a lengthy process, especially with being so anxious to get started with creating my Christmas photo masterpieces.  When the pictures finally appeared on the screen, I printed a few and, overall, was pleased with the quality of the photos, which wasn't the greatest, but didn't seem to create any distortion or fuzziness to the pictures.

After a month of owning the camera, I added fresh new batteries (which also run down very quickly with this camera) and got the camera ready to use for my baby's first birthday party.  As I went to take the first picture of my son eating his first birthday cake, I heard a click and saw a flash, just as usual, and then flipped the LCD display on to view the picture.  But instead of showing a picture, the screen showed "no pictures on memory card."  Thinking that this was just a one-time error, I took more pictures throughout the day, and was shocked to see that the number of pictures indicator read "0", and the LCD screen continued to read "no pictures on memory card."  To say that I was upset would be an understatement....how many times does my son turn one year old?!??  All those pictures obviously didn't take and weren't saved to the card, and basically were lost.

In the next several days, I tried everything I could think of to fix it.  I tried replacing the batteries, reformatting the memory card, removing the memory card and replacing it, but nothing worked.  I contacted the HP customer service center via their website, and received an email saying that I should try replacing the memory card, which I did, to no avail.  Finally, I ended up receiving a brand new HP PhotoSmart C215 digital camera, and thought that my problems were over.  Boy, was I wrong!

After several days of using the new camera with no problem, I set off to my niece's t-ball game with camera in hand.  After taking two or three pictures, I noticed that the indicator read "0", and as I reluctantly switched the LCD display screen on to view the pictures I THOUGHT I had taken, that dreaded message appeared again..."no pictures on memory card."  AHHHHH!!!  I was so aggravated, and again tried everything I knew of to try and repair the camera, but again, had no success.

So now, after owning two HP PhotoSmart C215 digital cameras, all I have to show for it is one useless camera lying in the bottom of my dresser drawer, some family Christmas Eve pictures, the thought of my son's first birthday party with NO pictures to remember it by, and a fear of ever purchasing or receiving another digital camera based on my negative experience.  So please take my advice on this product, and NEVER EVER EVER purchase an HP PhotoSmart C215 digital camera!  It's definetly not worth the trouble and effort.
