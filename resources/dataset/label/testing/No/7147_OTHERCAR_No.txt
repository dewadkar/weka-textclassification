            I would only drive a Chevrolet,because I liked the way they handled and the smooth ride. I bought a new Chevy S10 in 1989 and drove it till 1998 with no problems. If you keep the oil changed and regular checks they will last.This is what I would always tell everyone. Then in 1998 I decided I would like to have a new truck. I purchased a new 1998 Chevy S10 and it changed my opinion forever. Within the first 15,000 miles I had electrical problems,computer problems,then the transmission went bad. Chevy didn't even have a transmission replacement built yet!! So the dealer traded us for another 1998 S10. Within 22,000 miles the transmission went out. I tried talking with General Motors reps. about this and they told me to have it rebuilt and would not give me any kind of warranty. My 1989 S10 is still running and it has over 300,000 miles on it and only had to replace the computer. The new S10s are not as well built as the older models and the warranty is not as good. Now I drive a Nissan and I am very happy with the way it handles and the warranty. I drive over 400 miles a week and I need a car that I can depend on. If Chevrolet ever gets back to building their cars and trucks with the pride they had 10 years ago I might buy from them again.<br><br>
