            Two months ago I traded in my 1996 Chevy Cavalier.  Thank God!

It cost us thousands to get out of that mess......let's see, where do I begin?

The car only had 37,000 miles on it. (note the warranty ran out at 36,000)  From the start the car had electrical problems.  Fuses always blowing and battery's always dying.  This car saw (3) brand new batteries!  The dash and center shift console came loose by 20,000 and the driver seat broke.  This car was babied and the driver is thin!

500 miles after the warranty ended the cassette deck broke, the trunk release and again, the electrical problems were back.  

This car rattled and sounded like a tank.  At times the engine would lose 1/2 it's power for no reason......

Overall, I was very dissatisfied and almost felt taken.

Let's just say it was as bad as a bad investment.  I might as well have burned the 36 months of payments and the HUGE down payment!

Bye-Bye little red Cavalier!<br><br>
