            I bought this vehicle as my first SUV. I wanted something that would be useful for hauling goods to and from Home Depot for our new home. We were also purchasing furniture and wanted something larger to help bring items home. I love the look of the vehicle and the interior is laid out very well. The problem I have with it is how bouncy the ride is. 

Sitting in the front seat, the ride is bouncy. But really not much more than you would expect from an SUV. However, riding in the back is a different story. When we first bought the vehicle, we had friends in from out of town and took it for a spin. They were holding on for dear life! I moved to the back seat at one point to allow our guest to sit up front. Oh boy! Not a fun ride! 

We traded it in only months later. 

I must also state that the car I drove prior to the 4Runner was a Lexus ES300. So, I am not used to truck-type rides. We now have a GMC Suburban and got the deluxe suspension package. I must say, that is a SMOOTH ride. But, it is much more expensive. For those of you that don't mind a bouncy truck-type ride, this really is a nice, comfortable truck. However, if you are like me, I wouldn't recommend it.
