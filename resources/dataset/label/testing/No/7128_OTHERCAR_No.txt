            <b> This review was revised but it is an early review!</b>

<i>I am not crazy about this truck. I see I'm in the minority. We got it after having Minivans for years. The kids were grown, but we still wanted something with room to haul things in. The S-10 was inexpensive and my husband liked it:)</i>

We added a cab to it and there are some aspects I do like. 

<b>1.</b> With the cab on top, I don't have to worry about groceries, etc. getting wet.

<b>2.</b> We have slept in it. My husband rigged a platform and with a foam mattress it was fairly comfortable.

<b>3.</b> We can put a lot in it. Two kids have gone to college with it filled to the brim. On top of that we rented a u-haul and the truck pulled the u-haul with no problems.

It sounds like I should love this vehicle but I do not.

<b>1.</b>I don't like the ride. I think it is bumpy and I find myself feeling car sick during long rides.

<b>2.</b> I find the seats uncomfortable. My back starts aching during long rides.

<b>3.</b>I hear the outside noise more than I think I should. 

<b>4.</b>The rear door is heavy to lift. I'm strong, but I would think someone else may have trouble with it.

<b>5.</b>We have the 3rd door which is nice because it gives extra room behind the driver and passenger's seats. BUT if there is a lot of stuff behind the passenger's seat, the seat won't go down to recline. 

<b>6.</b>The 3rd door also gives you an extra seat..RIGHT..I'll call it a mini-seat. A child can sit in it and in an emergency an adult, but not for long. In addition, it doesn't face forward which for many people is uncomfortable.

It has been reliable, I'll give it that and it does get the job done, but I wouldn't buy another one. Basically it is a 2 person vehicle so you need to have another car that is roomy.
