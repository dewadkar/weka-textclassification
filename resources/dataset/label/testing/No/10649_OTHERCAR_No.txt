            We purchased our very first mini-van in Sept. 1998 after desiring one for several years. We finally settled on the Plymouth Grand Voyager &quot;Espresso&quot; model, 6 cyl, which included a cd player, floor mats, tinted windows, power adapters rear and a few other extras that we liked. We knew that we wanted the double sliding doors (can't imagine a van without them) and it seats 7 passengers very comfortably.

When we picked up the car from the dealer, we found that the front floor mats were missing (discovered that after we picked up the paper mats the dealer had placed on the floor) and the CD player had been replaced with a tape deck, there was also no owner's manual.  Well this was NOT acceptable at all.  We called the dealer immediately and he said they would order us new floor mats (which they did but they couldn't match to the rear mats) and they would get us an owners manual (which they did, but it was for a Dodge Caravan).  As for the CD player, we should have &quot;noticed&quot; that they had put it into another vehicle and replaced it with a tape player when we test drove the car.  Well excuse me for not thinking of checking to see if all the accessories listed on the window sticker as part of the package, had not been removed and replaced!!  We went back and forth on the CD player for a week until finally they agreed to replace it,(not with the original model but with a lessor generic one) and they damaged the dashboard when they put it in.

The first week we had the car the rear tailgate got stuck closed and we couldn't open it, some sort of a problem with the latch, had to take it back to the dealer to have it repaired (twice).  Next the windshield leaked air, made a loud whooshing noise and you could feel air coming in around the seal.  They resealed it, but forgot to plug the dash lights back in before putting it all back together, so we had to go back again.  Next the interior trim began to rattle and fall off, they had to order new clips to repair that problem.  One inherent problem with the car is that the headlights are terrible, they illuminate so poorly it is often difficult to see on a dark road at night.

I guess these are small problems, but they were big ones to us especially since most of the these problem occurred within a month or two of purchasing the vehicle. I have to wonder what else is in store for us with this car.  I owned a Toyota Camry for 10 years and my husband has a Honda Accord we never had one problem with either car, EVER.  I guess we just had higher expectations on the quality of this car.<br><br>
