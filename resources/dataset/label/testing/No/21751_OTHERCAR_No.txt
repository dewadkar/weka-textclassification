            The Cavalier is nicely shaped and pleasant to ride in.  The stock stereo system is not bad at all except the cd player started skipping after 20,000 miles. 
 My particular Cavalier has more problems then I could mention here...  for starters the exhaust system has something wrong with it that makes it backfire it you really give it gas.  The car does not reliably start or stop either.
  Most people I have talked to about their Cavs do not have these problems.  I happened to get a lemon.  If the car was reliable I would definitely give it five stars.
  We took mine from Seattle through Arizona to Mexico and back home.  That is some hard driving and a lot of miles and it stood up to the test.  With the air conditioning on in the desert the car didn't even think about over heating.  Even after being driven for 22 hours straight, still no problems.  We went over mountain passes and through snow and felt safe and secure the whole time.  And we got good gas milege.
  It is definitely a great all around car and perfect if you find yourself driving a lot.<br><br>
