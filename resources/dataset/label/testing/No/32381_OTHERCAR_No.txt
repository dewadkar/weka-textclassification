            I have owned two Lincolns since 1986, both the Mark VII and currently the Mark VIII. So as a suburbanite with two dogs, and a big yard, I thought a Lincoln SUV made sense.
So late in '98, when I began shopping for an SUV, I drove the Navigator at my local dealer. Yes it is big, and yes it is nice and quiet, but it is still bulky and has a lot of weight suspended over that air suspension system. I really didn't think it had a much better ride than some of the traditional big SUV's.
My other concern was resale value. Frankly, while I have enjoyed my Lincolns, their resale value has been terrible. They depreciate faster than almost anything else on the road. Especially in comparison with the Toyotas and Hondas of the world, Lincoln just doesn't hold its value.
I was also concerned with that air suspension. If you only plan on driving the Navigator for two years or so, on a lease, and then trading it back in, fine. But my experience with the air suspension on my Mark is that it begins to give out after about 60,000 miles, especially if you live in a cold weather climate. Replacing those air shocks is not cheap- count on at least $300 each!
I see a lot of these Navigators on the road, so obviously lots of people like them. Maybe I am getting more cautious in my old age, but I just couldn't bring myself to spending close to $50,000 for a truck. So what's parked in the garage now, next my Lincoln Mark VIII? 
Since you asked, its a '99 Blazer. Lots of fun to drive, and I paid less than $20,000- brand new!
