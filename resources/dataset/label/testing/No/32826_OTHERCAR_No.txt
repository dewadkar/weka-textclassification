            There have been so many things wrong with my Chevrolet Cavalier I cannot recommend that anyone buy one.
The car itself is fine.  It had a reasonable price and had nice features.
I'm not sure if the whole line is bad, if the car that I got was bad or if the dealer is just ripping me off when I go to get repairs.  But either way it doesn't matter much to me as it is costing me absurd amounts of money.
Just last week the air condition went bad.  I took it in to the dealer and they told me that they fixed it and charged me $180.  The next day it stopped working so I took it back.  The service guy(who looks like a rat) told me that the first repair was fine, but that something else broke(surprise!) and that it would cost me over $1000.  My back tail light had also just went out and I wanted to get that fixed.
I told them I wasn't going to spend $1000 for the air, but asked them to fix the light.  They did that and charged me $65 F--king dollars to fix one tail light.
There have been several problems with this car over the years.
I have always gone to the dealer(Jerry's in Baltimore) and got things fixed.  Although, this year there have been too many things wrong with it.  
I am going elsewhere to get future repairs to see if that helps.
I repeat that I don't know why there are so many problems with the car, but something is always wrong with it!<br><br>
