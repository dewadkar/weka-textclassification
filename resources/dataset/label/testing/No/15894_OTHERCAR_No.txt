            We bought a used Saab because we needed more room than what was in our Mustang. It turned out to be one of the worst mistakes we ever made! 
The first thing we did was go to Wal-mart to buy car cleaning supplies &amp; a few other things. When we were done shopping, it was dark. No problem, IF you have lights that work on your car! We did not. Ok, not the cars fault you say? I agree but Walmart does not carry lights for this car! We had to drive, in the dark, to the nearest auto store. Luckily, they had SOME of the lights we needed. At least we were able to make it home safely. The next day we had to drive over 1 hour to find a Saab dealership. We live in a small, sad little town. Anyway, Saab must be really attached to their lights as well as really proud of them. One light bulb for the dash cost $8. It was a tiny thing, about the size of a Christmas miniature light bulb. I thought the guy was joking at first.
We soon found out that IF you can find a place (other than Saab) that sells parts for this car, the cost is unreal!
The list of things that went wrong with the car is too long to list. To be honest, I have tried to put it all out of my mind. We had to replace the motor mounts, transmission, turbo, radiator, muffler, shocks, and other stuff that this female just doesn't recall or even know what they were for!
From what I have heard, Saabs are supposed to be good, reliable, lifelong cars. That must only be true if they are bought brand new from a dealer and still have a warranty. Once that warranty is up, be prepared to dish out some BIG bucks if anything breaks!! Even a little light bulb!<br><br>
