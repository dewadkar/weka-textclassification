            Well, I don't even know where to start with the problems I have had with this stupid car.  I think everyone ends up with a lemon to drive in their lifetime, and I hope this is my only one.

I own a 1990 Chevy Cavalier.  I bought the car because it was very affordable for the size.  I guess the nicest things I can say about the car is that it is roomy inside as well as in the trunk.  I also think it has a nice overall appearance.  That being said, I also think that it has many flaws with it.

I have only driven my car for about 55,000 miles, yet I seem to have replaced every part of the car at least once (in some cases twice).  Although I don't have very high mileage on my car, I do drive it a couple miles a day (on average).   My favorite repair was when my car wouldn't go in reverse.  I had to have the transmission rebuilt (again, at only 50,000 miles).  I still don't think the transmission works well even though it has been repaired twice.  I get a nice &quot;hum&quot; if I drive at a steady 30 miles per hour.  At least my car doesn't stall anymore.  My heating and air conditioning really change the temperature in the car well.  Too bad they make my car shake and sound like it wants to die.  Oh...  this comes after I already had the cooling system worked on.  A friend of mine described a problem with her car.  I immediately identified it as her alternator since I have had mine replaced several times.  I hate driving my car.  I don't drive it out of the city anymore for fear of never being heard from again.

Why do I still have this monstrosity?  Well, I am a graduate student and really don't have much money.  I should have ditched the car a long time ago.  If I could have foreseen all the money that I would put into this car, I would have done anything I could to buy a new car.  Hindsight really is 20/20.

I have heard good things about the newer Cavaliers.  I even drove one as a rental car.  I couldn't believe that my rental was in any way related to my clunker.  However, I will never buy another one.  I was burned too badly to do it all over again.  <br><br>
