            My husband and I bought a used 1993 Pontiac Grand Am about six months ago. My previously owned car, a Chevy cavalier, had well passed it's 100,000 mile mark so I figured it was time to trade it in on something a little newer. We checked around at several dealerships and came across the Grand Am that we ended up buying. It is a really great looking car for the money.

 It was well priced and only had 60,000 miles on it and looked in mint condition inside and out. I liked the roominess of the interior and it had and great trunk space (which I really needed since I have to haul around a giant stroller in my trunk at all times). 

We took it out for a test drive and it rode really smoothly. We both agreed that this was it. We bought and a couple of months later we started having problems with the battery. We replaced the battery and later ended up it needed a new alternator as well. Also the car tends to stall a lot when put into reverse and occasionally hesitates when you push the gas pedal, we are not sure why this is as we haven't had the money to get it checked out yet but my husband thinks it may be the fuel injection. I have no clue personally. 

Sometimes it is also slow to pick up speed, but once it does boy does it fly. I can't say it's really that bad of a car, it's a decent car for the money but as any car it's not perfect and has it's share of problems. I just hope it holds up until we get it paid off, LOL.<br><br>
