            Ok,

   I have been investigating digital cameras for about 3 weeks now.  I had previously purchased an HP PSC 2210 and decided I wanted to use its 4800 x 1200 resolution to make some pictures.  I therefore went to Compusa and tested the Kodak DX 4330, HP 820, Olympus D550, and the Canon A40.  The clerk at the store was nice enough to let me shoot and print a few samples to take back and analyze.  The Canon was the only 2 mp camera in the group but seemed to take a much cleaner (less grainy) pictures than the 3 mp models that I tested it against.  The folks at Ritz Camera told me that a high quality 2 mp from Canon or Fuji could beat a 3 mp HP or equivalent any day.  The photos seemed to confirm that with the HP having a wahed out looked to the colors, the Olympus having a yellow hue to the background, and the Kodak just plain grainy looking and over exposed.  The Canon seemed to have none of these problems.  When I went back to Best Buy the next time, there was a representative from Canon there who even took a pic and made it 8 x 10 with little loss of quality.  I was sold.
   Now for the disappointment.  Upon taking it out of the box and capturing my first photo I decided to test it out right away on a 8 x 10.  I set the camera to take the shot at maximium resolution 1600 and super fine compression.  After waiting 4 min for the pic to print, my hp was set to the highest settings, I was disappointed.  The image appeared to be both grainy and distorted.  I therefore decided to try again.  Using the same settings on took another shot and simply downloaded it to the software Canon includes with the camera.  Indoor shots seemed to have a problem with focus as well as lighting.  Portrait shots seem to leave the background a blur because of the high degree of grain and low light.  Changing to manual from automatic did little to correct this problem.
  I am hoping to do more testing and see if my original hypothesis was correct in that this camera is not as good as I thought, and that mabe some of the other reviews here are exagerated.  I would be interested in knowing form others if they have found some settings that they prefer.
