            Yeah, ok, the Eclipse is a cute little car, but lets be honest with ourselves. . .who buys cute cars?  Girls buy cute cars, small modes of transportation that are better left parked in the sun looking cute then driving hard on the twisties of your favorite back road.  The Eclipse is no real exception.
While the Eclipse if offered in a variety of engine configurations, the top of which produce sufficient &quot;oomph,&quot; this small cars handling characteristics fall a bit short of enthusiasts expectations.  I had the pleasure of driving this small car through its paces in a parking lot facing a building with mirrored windows.  While driving towards the windows I could see everything that the car was doing from a third person perspective.  When making hard turns, the Eclipse leaned heavily to the side and body roll was a factor (although most often the tires stuck and the car did not slide).  
If you are a guy looking for a sporty car that will drive hard and fast and be competitive at the red lights, then save your money for a muscle car or a Honda Prelude.  If you are a hot girl looking for a hot car to drive around sorority row in front of all the greek houses and catch the attention of a multitude of male passerbys, then by all means, this is the car for you.  Just don't try to win any races in it.<br><br>
