                My father owns a 1991 Ford Econoline van and it the biggest piece of junk he has ever owend. The van rides well but it only has a 302 V8 and does not any power whatsoever. It has a spacious interior and alot of room but that is the only good thing I can say about it. The van averages only 13 mpg, you cannot see out of the rearview mirror and it has no acceleration and you cannot keep the front-end aligned. 

   This is not a good vehicle to buy in general. I cannot recommend this van to anyone, it is nothing but a 7000 lb. gas hog. That is my opinion on the Ford Econoline van.<br><br>
