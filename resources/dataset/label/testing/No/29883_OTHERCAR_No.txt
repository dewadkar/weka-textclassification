            Hmmm....

How do I say this politely --- DON'T buy this car if you are forced to at GUNPOINT!   I purchased a cutlass for $3000 dollars and it had just a hair over 100K on it.  Most Oldsmobiles can truck on up to 200 and 300K but this beast decided to die a painful death three days after I bought her.  Much as I would try to revive her my efforts were in vain.  Let's review some of this cars basics.

Engine:  A rocking 3.4liter V6 with DOHC and enough guts to plow through a barn this car came equiped with a trailer hitch and could pull more than most small trucks! I have no complaints about the engine itself -- a powerful machine when the car runs.

Drivetrain:  The tranny was stable, but like most cars at 100k it was begining to age a little.   I have no complaints.

Features:  Most Cutlasses come loaded with options and mine was no exception.  Power locks, windows, sunroof and a kicking sound system.  

Room:  This beast has enough room to move your apartment!

Now that we've covered the basics let me give you a brief overview of some of the known issues with this car (all of which seem to have happened to me).  Before you buy a car check with the leading mechanical sites. Had I done this I would have saved a ton.

Power Steering:  Three days after I bought the car the power steering hose blew ($150 to replace the pressured connection).  This happened an additional 5 times in two years.

Brakes:  Any owner of this car will tell you that Brakes, Rotors and cables on this car go out -- ALL OF THE time.  I had to replace the pads four times and the rotors twice...all in less than 30k miles.  

Ignition System:  Look to replace all of the fuel injectors, spark plug wires and plugs for about $2500 total.

Every other component of this car was begining to fail until one fateful day the timing belt blew---and the was the end of the OLDS CUTLASS--alas my $3000 car cost me close to $5000 to repair and I ended up getting $50 from the junkyard for the darn thing.
