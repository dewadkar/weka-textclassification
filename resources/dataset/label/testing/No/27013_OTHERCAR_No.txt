            I purchased this camera after discovering a dozen rolls of undeveloped 35mm film inside my closet. I was convinced there had to be a better way for lazy people like me to get pictures faster. With that in mind I settled for the Olympus D450Z.

When I received the camera I was amazed at the thickness of the owner's manual. I sometimes took it to work to read it over during my lunch hour. It was hard to tell apart the different buttons used to get to the menus. I then decided to carry the manual with me wherever I went with the camera and found myself all the time looking at it before deleting the pictures etc. Once you learn the features and stop using the camera for a few weeks you will have to take a good look at the manual again to refresh your memory.
 
I'll never forget a few months ago I had the camera on a tripod and was ready to take a picture of a few of my friends. I wanted to include myself by using the timer. I had to review the manual to get to that point, and I took a little while doing so, one by one my friends left the scene, they could not hold a pose any longer.

The picture quality was very good with good detail and color reproduction. Pictures taken at night were very clear and bright. The built in flash which you have to open manually and sometimes forget to do so is good. I managed to take very good close ups.

The LCD screen used to review your pictures and menus  has a nice size clarity and brightness. However, you should be very careful because it scratches easily. In addition,you can not avoid leaving your fingerprints all over it. Try cleaning it every time you use the camera. Use a lens cleaning cloth sold at camera shops or you will scratch it.

This camera is not user friendly, it has no USB port. It uses a serial cable which is very slow to transfer the pictures to your computer and the software supplied by Olympus to do so is outdated. Olympus does not offer an update for it in their website. I sent them an Email requesting information about an updated version, they never replied. That also tells you something about their customer service.


You need to buy an AC adapter if you do not want to spend a lot of money in batteries, I managed to purchase a generic one for about $49.00. Just downloading the pictures to your computer will eat a pack of fresh alkaline batteries in  a flash. The accesories are expensive.

If you are looking for media cards be prepared to spend a few bucks.The cheapest is the 8 mb media card but does not hold a lot of pictures. One word of caution those media cards used to store the pictures will wear out with time so get a couple and rotate their use, that way they will get even wear and last longer. That applies to the expensive ones over 8 mb. Try auction sites you will get them cheaper.


If you do not want to be bothered with a lot of hard to learn menus or if you have little patience stay away from this camera. If you are looking for good picture quality regardless on how difficult this camera is to operate then go for it. After one year of use I sold mine. I still believe there has to be a better way.
