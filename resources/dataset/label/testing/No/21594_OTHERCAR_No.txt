             In the market for a used pick-up truck?  Don't fall in love with a GMC Sierra 1500 extended cab.  Naively, I did, and it was the worst choice I have made in my entire life.

 When I bought the truck new in 94, I need to admit that I had never owned a new vehicle before.  I had just begun teaching, and my growing family needed transportation.  Financially, I felt that I could afford the truck, even though a similar Ford model was cheaper.  However, the Ford salesman made light of my stupid questions, and out of sheer pride, I went with the GMC--so I guess I deserve what I got.

 What I got was a truck that was beautiful to look at, and could hold all 7 family members, if we scrunched up close.  Since we hardly all ever went anywhere at the same time, and could take the old car if we needed to, that worked.  The 8 cylinders made it powerful enough for the frequent 300 mile trips we made to visit family, and the ride was good--at first.

 Unfortunately, the captain seats in the front were a death trap.  Badly designed bolts would snap, and the driver's seat would fall backward without warning, putting the driver flat on his or her back.  Imagine that happening at freeway speed with no warning?  

 Luckily, the first time it happened, I was backing out of my drive, and not in danger.  But we had the seat repaired--under warranty, the truck was only months old--and then it happened again.  This time my oldest son was driving, but not on the expressway, and he handled the situation safely.  The GMC dealer said they didn't know what had happened, but they replaced it.  After 2 more incidents, we got a safety recall notice about the bolt problem on those seats--but it annoyed me that the dealer denied anyone else had had trouble.

 In addition to the seats, the rear window loosened and had to be replaced.  We have extreme heat in south Texas, but the whole window literally came undone.  Had I been more knowledgeable, I would have realized I had a lemon--but only afterwards did I find out what I should have known from the beginning.

 Although we still use the truck if we have to, we're going to have to replace the entire motor--right after the warranty expired, the truck began burning oil.  It's sad that this truck turned out so badly, because I had always heard that GMC trucks held their value longer and worked well.  My sister's older, one seat GMC had thousands of miles and was still running.  But this 94 model, at least in the extended cab version, has been a nightmare for us.

 If you do consider the 94 GMC Sierra extended cab, do ask about those seat bolts.  Be sure the recall work was done.  Even then--buyer beware! <br><br>
