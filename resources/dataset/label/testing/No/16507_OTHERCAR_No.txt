            I, too am not your typical Cabrio driver.  I am a 23 year old hetero male.  I had a white highline with a black canvas top, leather beige interior.  This car was sharp looking.  Never buy a car for how it looks if it is a lemon ... I recently traded this car after 5 months of ownership.  It was horrible.  The list of problems with this car are too numerous to place in this reveiw, so here are the big ones.  I got the car from Americar Superstore in Tewksbury, MA in May with 59k miles, and got rid of it in November with 75k.  During that time, I filed BBB complaints, and almost went to court over the problems this car had.  "Stackin' 'em deep, and sellin' 'em cheap" was this dealer's motto... buy from a reputable dealer ALWAYS. 

The engine is WEAK.  It is almost dangerous when entering highways, or when you need a little juice to pass someone.  Also, my manual transmission was leaking, slipping, and the clutch was bad (it is a 3 year old car, the clutch should not be bad).  

Breaking is ok, but you would expect better with a small car like this.  The ABS wires broke on the driver side, and were replaced twice.  The rotors wore very uneven, and the pads wear quick.

The canvas roof was splitting at the seam, and although this car claims to have a 7 layer roof, the back window area just after the seam is only 1 layer, meaning that if the seam splits, you have a leak.  It was glued by the dealer, but if this seam rips you need to replace the entire roof.  It is a heat seam, and glue is a temporary patch.

The leather was wearing through as if it was cheap vinyl.  It was stiff, dry, and cheap.  Also, the interior if this car is hard to clean because of its layout and materials.  Cleaning is important for a convertible because they get dirty fast with the top down.

The radio sucks.  The speakers blow out easily, and they are very poor quality.  The cup holders are good for cans only.  Cruise control accelerated on its own, which is dangerous.  The check engine light was on, but 3 dealers and service people could not figure out why.

Basically, this car is a lemon.  Parts are expensive, and I have met a few people in the 5 months I owned the car who had similar problems.  A service speacalist at a VW dealer told me that the Cabrio, Golf, New Beetle, and GTI are all lemons and have major problems.  If you want a VW, get a Passat or a Jetta.

Hope this helps.  Don't fall in love with a car ever.  Never buy a car for the looks if it is a mechanical nightmare.  If you do, don't say I didn't warn you.  I took a $5,000 loss on this car, so I know from experience.

Last but not least, do your homework and don't be stubborn.
