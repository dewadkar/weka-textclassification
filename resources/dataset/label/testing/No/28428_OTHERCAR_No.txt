            I bought the car in 1996 it was the first new car me and my wife ever bought and one of our biggest mistakes, its junk plain and simple spend the extra money and buy a different car, brakes replaced 3 times clutch shot in 4 years muffler and exhaust pipes rusted out dash board wilted up and changing colors all rubber hoses replaced due to dry rot you could think the car is abused but its not has 30000 miles on it and used to take kids to school, there service is not very good either take your car back more then once they start treating you as second hand. I can go on and on but I won't. Affordable I don't think so parts are expensive compared to other cars and if you don't believe me price air filters there three times as much compared to others if you can find one. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID........   <br><br>
