            My husband gave me this camera for Christmas of 2001.  He also bought the dock.  Initially, the first problem I had was that the rechargeable battery it came with would not charge.  I did everything possible, I even called Kodak, and it still wouldn't charge.  It still sits uncharged on my computer station.  

Once I got the battery situation sorted out, I use photo lithium, I started taking pictures and they looked pretty clear.  We don't have a photo printer so I can't say the quality is from the camera, I think it's from the printer.  When taking a picture you have to first gently press the button for it to focus before really taking the picture and this can make for many shots of one subject especially if the subject is a child.

It is pretty easy to review, delete and upload photos on and from the camera, especially with the dock.  I have been very happy sharing my pictures with family over the Internet and I have saved the best one's to disk for future development at the photo lab.  

It wasn't until several months after I had the camera that I noticed it did not have a self portrait setting.  Meaning that someone else always had to take the picture and I could not be in with the family unless there was an extra person around.  

The major problem I have had with the camera, other than the battery issue, is that The flash popped one day and since then has not worked.  That means that I can no longer take pictures inside anywhere.  I have to be outside in daylight.  No inside light is bright enough.  I consulted Kodak about the issue and it's basically now an outside only digital camera.
