            The 1999 Acura SLX is an over priced version of the Isusu Trooper. I find it unstable at speeds greater than 50 mph, and the instability grows dramatically when the wind is blowing. The engine is undersized with minimal pick up when the accelerator is pressed down. The gas mileage is poor, averaging at best 16 City and 18 highway. There is minimal cargo space. The controls for things like the radio are out of place and not easily reachable. There are no radio controls on the steering column a standard feature on many other models. The two things I do like are the heated seats and the retractable mirrors...but I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone else.
Why did I buy this vehicle...I depended on the good name of Acura from whom I had purchased 5 vehicles in the past. Their products are usually of very good quality. Also, I leased this vehicle for 30 months, supposedly in time for an SUV that is an Acura design, which I hope will be of better quality.<br>
