            When I first considered the Infiniti QX4 I viewed this vehicle as an up scaled Pathfinder. The Interior styling and rear heated seats, as well as the more powerful engine, were a considered as worthy of the increase in cost over the fully loaded Path Finder. Unfortunately, little did I know that other than the apparent aesthetic upgrades, I was buying a number of problems that are not present in the Path Finder. 

Just before purchasing my 2001 QX4 I was warned of a transmission slip problem. I addressed the concern with the dealer before buying and had been told that they had never heard of this issue. I later found out that this very person had handled this issue before with earlier models of the QX4. Despite my many requests to repair this problem, I have been told that it can't be fixed, or that this is not a problem. I don't accept that having a transmission in free spin between 2nd and 3rd for 2-5 seconds is safe or normal. 

When exiting my QX4 the safety belt will frequently get caught in the door. It is apparent that the tensioning mechanism may not have suitable tension to recoil the belt in colder weather. This problem has caused my seat belt to become prematurely worn, and has in a couple instances been jammed in the door when entering the vehicle. In this situation the belt will be fastened and the slack will be caught in the door. Ultimately if an accident had occurred the slack will be released and the safety belt will not provide sufficient protection to avoid injury. Infiniti denies any issue with the safety belts and will neither repair nor replace the worn belt. 

Having driven a vehicle with a larger engine and a 1000 lb. higher mass, I had expected the QX4 to consume significantly less fuel. Rather the QX4 to my surprise consumes ~40% more fuel. I am not sure whether to attribute this to poor engine efficiency or aerodynamics, which most SUV's rank poorly. 

The most confidence inspiring moment in my QX4 occurred when while driving home on a Friday evening just a few days before Christmas, I was called by a service representative of Infiniti, and asked if I was driving the vehicle. I confirmed I was. I was told to pull over and to give the location so that it could be towed to the service center. I asked what the problem was, and was brashly told that there was an ignition problem. I asked for elaboration, of which the service rep hesitantly mentioned that there was an emergency recall due to an problem with a pin in the ignition switch that will during a tight turn lodge itself locking the steering column into the turned position. It can be clearly assumed that this is not a good thing. I was told to rent a similar vehicle for the period of the repair, which I was told would be only a few days. 5 weeks later I got my QX4 back. Too bad, I was enjoying the Tahoe (2weeks) and the Expedition (3 weeks) I had rented much more. The delay was due to an unavailable replacement ignition switch. 

What ever you do, be careful using the convenient safety belt mounts in the rear seats when raising and lowering the back seats. If not used carefully, the base of the seat belt will tear or scuff the leather of the back seat. 

I do not recommend this vehicle and have asked Nissan Credit to provide me with a statement of account along with possible exits from this contract. Basically, I have a vehicle that Infinti will selectively take responsibility for issues that they wish to recognize. I am also trapped with no cost effective exit other than riding out my lease. 

Run, don't walk, away from the QX4
