            The ls1 ride was the best I've had in a car.  Better  than Toyota, better than Honda, better than Suburu. I own a '93 sl2 with 80,000 mostly trouble free miles on it.  For this ride,  I drove about 5 miles of  fairly bumpy road. It was a soft quiet ride.   It seems like the engineers studied the major shortcomings of  sl2 and designed this car s specially to solve those problems.  No rain gets in the car like it used to.  There are couple inches more head room and legroom than in the sl series.  The 135 hp 4 cyl engine  is plenty powerful enough for me. The passthough in this car is significantly larger than the Toyota's.  Also the trunk volume is gigantic for a midsize car.   Also the engine runs very quietly, unlike the sl series.  I just liked the car--so much so that I can't forget it.  

My single and major drawback is General Motors corp. itself.  I have no confidence in this company.  I feel their top management doesn't give a damn about their employees or customers.  Their showrooms are going to the dogs.  Their service managers are hired purely to see how much money they can squeeze out of repair jobs.  When I bought my Saturn, it was an indepenent company and I loved it.   Now it's just a typical and ignored division of GM.  No honest  commitment to reliability or quality here.    Over the years my dealer has gotten less and less straightforward when dealing with me.  Fool me twice shame on me.    It is unlikely i'll buy another  Saturn.

The 4 cyl sl-1 incl mats, sunroof, foglights, am/fm cass, 6-way pwr seat, mud flaps, leather seats, plates, w/o state sales tax was priced at $21,100.  No tradein was involved.<br><br>
