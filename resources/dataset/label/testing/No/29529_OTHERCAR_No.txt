            I purchased a digital camera to save costs of developing, and storage space (albums) Digital cameras are great for Graphic artists, EBay (auction)sellers, web designers, and anyone into photography. I liked this camera because of it's ease of use, ability to zoom, I have the choice between taking color photos, B&amp;W, and even Sepia! I can add frames to my pictures, it has many great aspects.
BUT!......when deleting pictures from the camera, or doing anything to them via the software, is very time consuming. If you fill up a disk, give yourself at least an hour to save and delete them from he camera.
It also uses A LOT of battery juice. It DOES come with a set of regular batteries, and a set of rechargeable batteries, AND an adapter, which is GREAT! I suggest you get another set......so when it drains the batteries and you need to recharge, you have a spare set to interchange.
The worst thing about this camera, and it may be the same with others, I do not know. There is a few seconds delay, from the time you press the button and the time the picture is taken. Surprisingly enough the delay screws up a lot of pictures, if they're moving, or it's a spur of the moment shot. Best if used to take still shots.
