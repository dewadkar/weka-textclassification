            My mechanic probably took several trips around the world on the money he made off my 1990 Blazer.  This is not to say that he was shady mechanic, because he is very trusted in our community.  Most of the time we actually had to have it towed in.  I bought it in 1994, when I turned 16, with 58,000 miles on it.  It seemed in good shape, but the owner before me had to know what he was doing when he got rid of it.

Within months, the expenses started mounting up.  It seems almost everytime we got the oil changed we were having to replace a $100-300 part.  Again, this was stuff that I had heard rattling, or was not working, not just shady mechanics.  Almost every major part under the hood and from front to back had to be replaced.  When we sold it last month with 125,000 miles, it was soon to need a need transmission and engine work.

Over the past 2-3 years, this SUV has had the worst pickup and go of any car I've ever been in.  Getting on the interstate was taking your life in your own hands.  Getting up a steep hill was impossible.  It used 3-5 quarts of oil every 3000 miles in addition to what they put in during the oil change.  As a result, it constantly smoked, which was always encouraging.

I keep the interior very clean and it was a very roomy car, but the mechanical stuff was horrible.  The A/C was constantly not working for some reason (usually a $200 part would fix it).  I paid $10,000 for it in 1994, and got $2500 for it on trade in for it last month.  This would be a good return for 6 years of use if I hadn't spent about $700-1000 a year on repairs.

This was a good car at the time, but be weary of buying one now.

Please read my review of my 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe that I absolutely love.  Quite a step up from the 1990 Blazer.<br><br>
