            About a year ago I went shopping for a car. I was specifically looking for an Oldsmobile, as I'm a previous owner of an Olds. I wasn't to familiar with the Achieva, I am now. I found a 1993 Achieva S with a Quad 4 and 82,000 miles on the odometer for $6500. I test drove it and put it through the paces. The car handled real well and I liked every thing about it, until I got it home. 1 week after buying the car I took it to an auto shop to have it checked out and have the oil changed and every thing has gone down hill from there. Inside of a years time I've had to replace struts, brakes(twice), calipers and toe ends. I've had a front end alignment done and it still pulls hard to the right. My oil light is constantly coming on even though my oil pressure reads at 70%, the best I've ever seen in a small car, and I don't have an oil leak. The only thing on this car that does work right is the stereo and the acceleration speed. I plan on getting rid of it at the first opportunity. I'm wondering if the manufacturer set this up on purpose, because it costs an arm and a leg to get it fixed and the parts are outrageous. You can only get the parts from the dealer. And who manufactures the parts? Olds! Stay away from this car for your own wallets sake.<br><br>
