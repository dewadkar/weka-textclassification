            We were just about to sign the papers for a Toyota Sienna last year when we saw the ad for the new 1999 redesigned Honda Odyssey. We ran out to the Honda dealer and saw the only one they had...already sold so we couldn't take a test drive. 
We went ahead and put our names on a list and one finally came in that we could buy; it was a dark green which was not a desired color, so others on the waiting list passed it up. I wish we had too.

The Honda Odyssey EX-1999

The Good:
It's big and roomy, though it doesn't seem as large as our trouble prone 3 yr old Chrysler Town &amp; Country was. We love the rear cargo area and how it has a &quot;well&quot; to store things so they don't slide around.  The seats in the middle adjust so they can be used as a bench or as separate captain's seats. Pushing them together allows easier access to the back bench. Most of the controls are well placed and easy to use (except the outlet for cigarette lighter--see below)

The Bad:
We have had terrible luck with the dual auto doors.  We had the van back to Honda at least 7-8 times with a problem that they said didn't exist until we got a recall notice. Even after it's been fixed, we're STILL having problems.  We're also concerned about the door closing on one of the kids. Although the doors are safety equipped to re-open, we tried it and they put a LOT of pressure on you before they pop back open. That means a young child can still get hurt, and once the doors start closing you can't stop them unless they hit you and bounce back.  

The dealer told us that the van can run on either regular or premium gas, but the horsepower is higher with premium. What he didn't tell us is that the van has very little pickup if you use regular grade gas. Using mid grade or higher means much higher gas costs...esp. with the rising gas prices now. Our Town &amp; Country had just as much pickup using regular grade gas.  The pickup is ok, but not any better than the T&amp;C or Nissan Quest we had.

My wife is 5'3&quot; and complains that the gas pedals 'seems' further back and she can't comfortably rest her heel on the floor unless the seat is moved very close to the steering wheel.

We also believe the ride is fairly rough. Many other reviews have said the van has a quiet ride. We disagree. We feel every bump. Our Town and Country was much better on the road, as was the Toyota Sienna we test drove. 

If you use the cigarette lighter outlet for charging your cell phone, or for other purposes, it's located way down near the floor which is very annoying to use.

Finally, because the van is so popular there are (or at least were) NO discounts. We paid full sticker price which is less than what many other people paid. We've heard of people paying up to $5000 over sticker price. 

The Ugly:
Well, I used that term because it went well with the title. We like the stylishness (if that's a word) of the van.<br><br>
