            I bought my Neon because I liked the look of the car, it handled really well -- and the price was right.

I really liked my Neon first of all.  Then I noticed that the driver's side window rattled.  The dealer told me that ALL Neon's did that and nothing could be done.

The transmission went when my car was just over two years old!  Gears slipped, car lurched when accelerator was pressed.  My car seemed fine after the first transmission repair, but within one week it refused to go after I had stopped at a stop sign.  It has been back to the dealer twice and is again showing recurring transmission problems.

This car did not live up to my expectations.
