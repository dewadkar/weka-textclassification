            We purchased this Sable in June 1994 as what the dealer called a &quot;demo.&quot;
It had 4800 miles on it and really looked clean.  About 3 months after purchasing it I noticed that the transmission was slipping slightly.  I brought it back to the dealer to have it checked and they said a pin came lose.  Don't ask me what that meant, but they said everything is fine now.

Well it was for 3 days because I didn't really use the car during that time. However, we decided to take a trip to Atlantic City from New York and about half way there POOF goes the transmission.  We had the car towed to a Ford dealership nearby.  We were told after about an hour that the transmission is shot and it would take a day to get a new one in.   Here we are without a car in the middle of what felt like nowhere, so we decided to rent a car from the dealer and continue to Atlantic City.  The dealer actually told us there would be no charge for the rental!  I was impressed.  

The following day the dealer got in touch with us and said that the transmission in the car was a rebuilt one and NOT from Ford.  However, being that I bought the car from a Ford Dealer they would make good on it and charge me only $50.00.  

We arrived at the dealership the following day to pick up the car and sure as can be he showed us that the old transmission was not a Ford product.  However, they did replace it and kept to the $50.00 promise.

Everything was going well for the next 6 months and then the car starting jerking like crazy whenever the speed exceeded 30 miles an hour.  So back to my local dealer again.  Not to my surprise he told me that all that was needed was an adjustment. YEA RIGHT!  I took the car, after the adjustment to my mechanic and he lowered the pan and what we saw was lots of little pieces of metal or aluminum in the pan.  He told me this was parts of the transmission and the jerking had caused something inside the transmission to crack.

Back to Ford again.  They called in a &quot;specialist&quot; who determined that the transmission was defective and it needed to be replaced.  So here comes transmission number 3. 

Mind you, this vehicle had only 18,400 miles and we have had 3 transmissions.  We finally got rid of this car about 3 months after the 3rd transmission.
