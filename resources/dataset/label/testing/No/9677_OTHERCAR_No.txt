            This is a good car for those of you who are going to beat on it and race it and modify it and stuff like that.  If you're that person, then you'll never care about the fact that the passengers side glass doesn't fit well against the seals and makes a lot of noise.  You'll also think that it's all that hotrodding you've been doing that caused the head gasket to blow at 40,000 miles and puke out prodigious amounts of engine oil (like a quart a day).  You'll also probably buy a stick shift so that you'll never have the irritation of the automatic transmission forgetting, at 60,000 miles, that it has a third gear until it's been running for 10 minutes or so.

There it is, fit and finish, head gasket, automatic transmission.  Otherwise, a perfectly good car with an enormous availability of aftermarket goodies.
