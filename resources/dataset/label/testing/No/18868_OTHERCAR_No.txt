            I have not purchased this vehicle but I have test driven it and I have a friend who has one as well.  I did not buy this SUV because I felt that the interior was too cramped.  In the back seat, the seats recline, but not the whole seat reclines making it only good for kids because if an adult tries to recline it, half of your back gets stuck on the part that is not reclining (unless you are super skinny).  It is also questionable whether 3 adults could sit comfortably in the back seat of this car.

While it looks nice on the outside, and handled fairly well,  the acceleration was a little more sluggish then it should have been.  It did not accelerate as well or as quickly as the Honda CR-V.  It's 4 cylinder engine is typically lagging in responsiveness.

I felt that this vehicle was a little overpriced for the package they were offering me.  Toyota, in general, prices their cars so that they make you  pay for every single option (they &quot;nickel and dime&quot; you) instead of offering option packages.

I did not buy this car.  I would not recommend this car for families because of the lack of space.  I also would not recommend it if you looking for performance.<br><br>
