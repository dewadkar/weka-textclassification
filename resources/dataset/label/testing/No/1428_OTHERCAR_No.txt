            I bought this car brand new back in June of 98.  I liked its looks and peppy engine.  Paid way too much for a car with few options.  It had A/C, aftermarket wheels, aftermarket sunroof.  It had no power windows, no power locks, and came with the base am/fm stereo.  In the beginning I was pleased with the car.  It got 30+ mpg and would beat most cars off the line.  As I owned the car annoying problem began to arise.  About 6 months after I bought it, the steering wheel began to shake at freeway speeds.  I took the car to a tire shop to get the wheels balanced and the steering wheel still shook.  The tire shop rebalanced it and the problem remained.  The tire shop recommended I take it into the dealer because something could be wrong with the front end.  The dealer then tells me that most Neons with aftermaket wheels have this problem because of a faulty lower control arm bushing that allows the wheel to vibrate.  The dealer recommends that I take the car to a shop that has a special balancer which can balance the wheels while they are on the car, but it would cost over $60 to balance just the front tires.  To this day the steering wheel rattles my keys and watch at freeway speed.  There are lots of other sounds to listen to while driving this car.  There is the annoying rattle in the steering column, the creaking of the sunroof, the squeaking of the door panels, the roar of the road, the wind leaking through the window seals.  Recently I took the car in for some warranty work.  I was having problems with engine leaks and a roaring noise from the gas tank.  I was having to add oil to the car all of the time.  It turned at that the head gasket had failed.  The car only had 40k miles at this point.  Older Neons are notorious for bad head gaskets, something like 40% of Neons have had the head gasket replaced. Dodge has a good will program for replacing head gaskets on Neons that are off warranty.  They have yet to help me out as my car was on extended warranty, but it cost me a $100 deductible to replace Dodge's mistake(there is a improved head gasket out now).  The head gasket was not on my list of problems when I took the car in.  The service advisor had said that the other problems were from the failing head gasket.  And of course I still have the original problems with a new head gasket.  I had wanted to trade the Neon in for a larger car.  The Neon had depreciated so much that I could not trade the car in.  I paid over $14k in 1998 and in 2000 the dealer would only offer me $7000 for a Neon in excellent shape with 30k miles.
