            We have owned our 2003 Prius for 3 months and are very disappointed with it. Moreover, we are appalled by the outright hostility exhibited by Toyota customer service.

The paint: we keep our Prius in the garage when not in use. We chose the dark blue. The paint is very chipped all over the vehicle. Our Chevy tracker (identical color) showed about the same degree of paint damage when we turned it in to purchase the Prius, but that was after 3 years, not 3 months.

Gas Mileage: We bought this car in a sincere attempt to be environmentally responsible. In theory the exhaust is supposed to be as clean as the air in Los Angeles, and it is advertised as being able to achieve 52 mpg in city driving. At 960 miles on the odometer, I am getting 36 mpg, about the same as our aging Saturn. It is solely suburban stop/start driving which should maximize the MPG.

Dashboard Display: I do not drive the car at night, but my husband must first shut off all displays because he finds them so distracting as to interfere with safe driving. The car was serviced earlier this week for the first time and I asked the dealer to examine the gas gauge because I believed it to be incorrect/defective. When the tank is full, the gauge shows a series of small rectangular boxes. As fuel is used, boxes disappear. I have used the odometer to "time" how many miles may be driven per little box, and it varies widely; yet I seldom change my daily route or driving circumstances in any way. Further, the dealer's service manager told me he knows of no Prius owner who is getting the advertised mileage.

Tires: Last week in one of my feeble attempts to parallel park, I lightly scraped the tires against the curb as I have been doing from time to time in every car we have owned during the last 40 years. The front right tire exploded. Bridgestone said the warranty did not cover this because it was a "road defect." I am not the world's best parallel parker, but have never before had a tire explode - or even go flat during parking. The tires did not yet have 950 miles on them.

Roadside assistance - I was put on hold for over 20 minutes.
Finally, I called my Dealer who called Toyota and had them call me back on my cell phone. The Dealer called me first to tell me he had gotten through. It then took more than 45 minutes for Roadside assistance to get back to me and I was told it would be another 45 minutes to an hour for them to arrive.

Handling: it is OK for day to day suburban driving, provided you do not frequently travel on expressways difficult to enter, or on many curved roads. It's pick up is about the same as the Tracker we just returned, as is the handling. We expected better performance, but it is OK.

The trunk is slightly larger than the Honda hybrid equivalent, which is why we chose the Toyota. I am a tiny person, so it is fairly comfortable for me, except after having driven a Tracker, I miss not sitting up high to better be able to see traffic.

The primary source of our outrage with Toyota, however, relates to the following small print item in the owner's manual which is not provided until after you have become an owner and Toyota's response to our inquiries:

The manual requires the car to be run at least 30 minutes every 2 weeks, or both the 12 volt and hybrid batteries "may deteriorate," a fact that is not disclosed in any Prius advertising brochures or in the sales training for this car (according to our dealer who was unaware of the requirement until we pointed it out the small print in the manual). The other dealers where we comparison shopped also did not mention this upon being specifically asked if there were any special maintenance requirements for this hybrid.

In fact, even once one buys the car and is given the manual, one might not immediately notice the requirement because the "important requirements" are highlighted in Yellow boxes, and this requirement is not.

Thus, if one is injured, ill or simply wishes to take a long vacation, one must arrange for someone to run the car,  because, as stated in the warranty booklet (a separate document) failure to comply with any maintenance requirement may void the 8 year warranty on the very expensive and unique hybrid components or the 3 year warranty on the other components.

The foregoing was confirmed, verbally, by two different Toyota representatives who replied to letters to the president of the company, "Joel" (last name unknown)and Jessica Ketchum. Both representatives refused (when asked) to put their replies in writing, stating that the manual and warranty booklets speak for themselves. I had written to the President of Toyota a second time because we received a different interpretation from the first customer service representative with whom we spoke, and another person on the Internet received yet a third interpretation.

Further, these reps were intimidating and hostile. Joel, for example, asserted it was our fault for not reading the manual before buying the car. Aside from the fact that no manual was made available, I know of no one purchasing any car who is given a manual to peruse before a purchase.
Another rep told us that "everyone" knows you cannot leave any model car of any manufacturer garaged for more than 2 weeks and expect it to start without a jump. In 40+ years of car ownership neither we, nor anyone we know (we have since asked), has faced not having a car start if left garaged for as long as a month and even more. 

This is customer service?

We strongly feel that this is an issue that Toyota should disclose in advance, as many people, such as ourselves, leave their cars garaged for more than two weeks at a time.
We would not have purchased this car had we known of this maintenance requirement and we did ask (before making the purchase)if the hybrid involved any special care. Additionally, other than my posts to the Internet in recent months, we have yet to find any mention of this two week requirement anywhere.

We have friends who are happy with their Honda hybrid and after hearing our story, looked at their manual. Honda "recommends" running the car for 30 minutes every month (not two weeks). It is a suggestion, not a requirement and there is no threat that the warranty on the hybrid components may be voided for failure to comply.
