            I was looking around studying cars for nearly 2 months before my old piece of tin ran out of juice.  Yep, it was time to buy a new car.  I knew what I wanted:  a new, reliable (read: Japanese) sedan with a fast V6 engine for about $22000, including TTL.

Although the Camrys and Accords almost fit this bill, they don't sell for much under MSRP.  The Maxima had its appeal, but still a hair too pricey.  Mitsubishi Galants have had a spotty reliability record in the past.  But, I checked them all out anyway.  When I got into the Mazda, I knew which car I would be buying.  With comfortorable seats and a solid factory stereo, my personal comforts would be attended to, and the V-6 mated with a Manual can merge onto the highway even with the shortest onramps.

Speed, speed, speed and more speed.  My last car could hardly accelerate its way out of the driveway, but this little sedan smacks the more expensive imports in their chrome grills and leaves a coat of dust on their hoods.  But still the car is smooth and quiet (though the factory tires make a fair amount of noise).  It corners very well despite being limited to 215/60R15 rubber.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that without the luxury package ($1600 = Bose stereo+power seats+alloy wheels), no map lights are standard.  I had to spring for a clip-on flashlight and some AA batteries.  Also, after riding in the Camry, I realize that a luxurious ride is something that I lack.  Not that I mind, since I like to feel the road, but I can see the appeal nonetheless.  Probably the worst part of owning this car is that it doesn't have enough market share that usually common replacement parts such as the oil and air filters have to be either special ordered or bought from the dealership--either of which sets you back more than you intended to spend.

So who should buy this car?  Well, if you're looking for substantial performance with thoughtful luxury touches such as swinging air vents at a very low price, then look no further.  At these prices, you can afford that new car.  The spaciousness of the interior cabin and trunk mean that four or even five tall adults can all fit comfortorably in the car, and so can their luggage.  Besides, everyone else has a Camry or Accord, so do something different.

Of course, if your behind needs to be pampered by a silky-smooth ride, you might need to look elsewhere.<br><br>
