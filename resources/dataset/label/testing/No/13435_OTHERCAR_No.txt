            We bought one brand new in 1996 fully loaded, it was the biggest mistake we made. We are practically paying for a car that is falling apart as we drive. The brake system employed out of the factory are cheap metallic pads that we had to replace at 18,000 miles at the dealership, of course we had to pay for them since the warranty does not cover brakes,( twice now) also the steering wheel covering wore off before the warranty expired so we lucked out, the leather seat was replaced by the dealership at 28,000 miles and now it needs replacing again for the same problem but the warranty expired so the dealer will not cover it, they said it was a
factory defect and it is not their problem, the ABS system had to be re-programmed on a recalled, we also just received another recall for the 
windshield pump in the rear door,  the check engine light has been on since we bought the car and the dealer said they cant figure out why. Stay away from this particular model while it looks nice it is cheaply built and expensive to maintain...... <br><br>
