            This is a very nice car. I have had this car for 1 year. I runs very well. Its in side is very nice. If you want one you should go and get one. It is the best car you will ever have. When i want to get a new car i will go out and get a new Mitsubishi Eclipse. I think that you should go out and get a new 200 eclipse right now. The car is very fast. I have a V-6 in it and the power is very good. The color that i have is red. I work and a Mitsubishi car company so if you would like to know more about this car i would like to hear from you.
