I dislike the whole automobile for a couple reasons.  It burns way too much gas, and the moan of the tires can get a bit annoying after a while.  The third door often leaks and I had to bring it into the dealers to get it fixed a couple of times.  If you are looking for a carefree truck, the S10 is not the way to go.
