            I found the Liberty to have very uncomfortable seats. This makes it the car I don't want to take on a long trip. I think I'd rather drive a Wrangler than a Liberty as far as comfort, and I've driven a Wrangler for two-weeks straight from Atlanta to California with camping gear. Someone should shackle the designer to a narrow rock and let him feel how comfortable the Liberty seats are. This is probably the biggest foul of the Liberty.

The glove compartment is tiny. They could have added a centimeter of depth and the maps would fit and the door would close. I'm glad that Chrysler doesn't discriminate on the basis of species, but I wish they didn't employee the chimps to design the glove box.

There is this stupid plastic thing they stuck at the bottom right of the rear doors. These are held in place with plastic screws. I guarantee a lot of people are going to have these break off when the plastic starts to get old or a person happens to put some weight on it while entering or exiting the vehicle. The person that designed this should quit his day job and consider the engineering complexities of French fry cooking.

The window control placement is very odd. I am guessing this was because they tended to go bad when it was on the door (I had to replace those twice on a 99 Grand Cherokee I had within 36,000 miles).

The steering wheel is very small. The interior is somewhat thrown together with too many curved shapes. I think the interior designer of this car should lay off the marijuana and get rid of the Volkswagen Beetle in the garage.

I have a backache from driving in my Liberty. Can I take this thing back and get something else?

I have considered boycotting Jeep for the removal of the ashtray. They provide you with a over-priced smoker's group that is essentially a cup holder you put in the cup holder. There is a place under the dash perfect for an ashtray. I am going to wait and see if someone makes an ashtray that fits in a dash. I hate the Nazis that made the decision that an ashtray wasn't important. Even if you don't smoke, you have to admit it makes for a good trash compartment for the $2 candy bar wrappers of the Nazi pigs who complain about the $2 expense it adds to the vehicle. Several people have complained about the lack of storage components. And for those that pinch pennies and complain about the lack of coin holder, it does make for a good penny holder.

The car leans really badly around moderate curves. I also experienced a bit of side-to-side sway on the interstate behind a semi. There is a huge rollover risk with this vehicle. I feel safer in a Wrangler. They need to do some work to the suspension of this vehicle to keep it from leaning so much. You can prevent lean by adding firmer horizontal stabilizers without sacrificing higher center of gravity.

Handling is a little too exact. It takes awhile to get use to it after guiding nothing but Jeeps for several years.

No standard ABS. They should aiding side impact bags as standard so that they can brag about being concerned about the life of their customers on television and reduce fears of Liberty rollovers.

The rebate is $4K on the Grand Cherokee. The rebate is $2K on the Liberty. I should have took the bigger rebate and found a Grand Cherokee that had a color I liked.

The upside is that it does have good ground clearance though I think skid plates should be standard on a Jeep. 

It does have excellent power and towing capacity. Feels like it has more power than the Grand Cherokee around town. Though I'm sure the engine isn't as durable as the I-6. It is sluggish when passing on the interstate.

The outside styling is OK though it does look a little like a chick car.

The khaki and silver looked good. I considered the cactus green and the blue color as well.

It does feel tight and cushioned on the road. It seems to absorb and withstand jarring jitters better than the Cherokee.

It does have some cool new features such as a tire pressure readout and heated seats. The in-dash 6-CD changer is also nice. There is also the auto-dimming rear view mirror and the mirror defrost. The garage door opener would be cool if it accepted the signal from my gate opener. I'm sure the hands-free communication thing would be cool if I got it. 

Not worth all the negative. I talked to the salesperson tonight about exchanging for a Cherokee. I'm going back tomorrow morning to talk the general manager about it.

If you want the Liberty because it is small and seems like a good off-road vehicle...save your money and buy a Wrangler even if it has no cargo room. You can always take out the backseat, get a cargo box from Home Depot and the proper size bolt from Ace Hardware, and bolt it in place after you cut a hole in the container for the bolt. The Wrangler is more comfortable and is more of an off-road vehicle.

If you must have comfort and luxuries....opt for something like the Grand Cherokee. Go with at least a 2000 year Cherokee though. You'll be replacing a transmission in a 98 around 100K miles and frequently replacing the electric window switch in the 99. The 98 Cherokee is too stiff and rattles too much. The Wrangler is really stiff, but the bounce softens the stiffness, much like the Liberty though the Liberty isn't as stiff. You really should test drive this thing driving in various conditions for at least an hour before you make a decision to buy it. I've learned my lesson. I put too much trust that the designers at Chrysler would put forth at least the effort of an associates degree of science.
