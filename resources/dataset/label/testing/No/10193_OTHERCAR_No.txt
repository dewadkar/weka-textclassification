            And you thought Lexus only made luxury cars.

*INTRODUCING* The Lexus RX 300. There is no other like it.

So, where do I start?

The Acceleration: is off the charts! The ride was DEAD quiet, I could have fallen asleep (luckily, I didn't!)! Well, I didn't fall asleep, but the passenger did. The RX 300 was so quiet, I had to turn the a/c on to here some noise!

The Ride: Oh, wow, I couldn't BELIEVE the ride. Oh, and something you may want to watch out for, bumps. This SUV cannot handle bumps, so hold on for a ride if your an off-road driver, or even on highways. If your heading for a road, hold on to the steering wheel. Your in for a ride.


Comfort: Leather, Leather, Leather. This is the most comfortable wagon seats I have *EVER* sat in. No excuses! You could be sitting only half way on the seat, and you are still comfortable. Leather is something you will first notice about this vehicle.

Value: Ok, don't jump out of your seats, the RX 300 is a *little* expensive. But for $37,000, you get the buck for the money. This vehicle is the package.

Gas: If you live in the mid-west, gas prices are high, and I will not lie, you will pay a little more for fuel then a sedan. I got 18 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the interstates and highways. 

Space: For a mid-size SUV, the Lexus RX 300 has plenty of space. In the backseat, you can fit three adults. In the front, you can fit two adults.

So you see, the Lexus RX 300 is great. Almost everything about this vehicle is GREAT. Two words: *NO EXCUSES*
