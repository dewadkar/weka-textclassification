                CALLING ALL CHRYSLER MINI-VAN OWNERS:  If you own or have owned a Plymouth, Dodge, or Town &amp; Country minivan, I am interested in finding out which of us has had the most unfortunate experience of owning the biggest lemon! How foolish I was, not to have turned my vehicle back in as an actual &quot;lemon&quot; under the &quot;Lemon Law&quot; within the permitted time period.  Did you make the same mistake?
     I am the frustrated owner of a 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan SE, purchased in Bellevue WA in June of 96 for $30,803.50.  As of May of 2000, my van currently has 41,000 miles on it (this is considered average to low miles), and has been to the dealership 25 times for repairs.  Of these 25 visits to the service department, 19 visits were necessitated by something faulty with the van (door locks, windows, antifreeze leaks, etc...).  
     My van's most recent visit to the repair shop was by tow truck for a broken water pump.  This was covered by warranty, except the serpentine belt that broke as a result of the broken pump was not.  I was expected to pay this cost.  A phone call to Daimler Chrysler Customer Service did eliminate this charge, but they did so only because of my complaint. 
    The Dealership has said that they would trade me another vehicle of approximately the value my van should be worth for mine.  I was told this in early February and am still waiting.  So far I have been shown 2 vans that the dealership would consider swapping me for.  Neither of which came close to the value my van should have.
   Here's the catch:  I have a van that is not worth a heck of a lot due to its' extensive repair history.  The dealership does not want to trade me a vehicle for what my van should be worth, because they then will have to unload my van elsewhere and take a loss on it.  I can hardly blame the dealership. They are stuck in the middle!  They have me on their back and as an independent dealership, they can't seem to get any help from Daimler Chrysler.  Is this right?  Should the middle man take the fall? Should I, the consumer have to suffer the loss of value of the vehicle and the extreme frustration and inconvenience of owning a non-dependable automobile?  Should Daimler Chrysler not be responsible for a vehicle that never should have come off the assembly line?  
     Please let me know your opinion and I am sure Daimler Chrysler would be interested in your comments too.  I could not find an e-mail address for them, but their customer service line is 1-800-992-1997.
Thank you for your time, and safe driving!
Sincerely, 
Lisa
