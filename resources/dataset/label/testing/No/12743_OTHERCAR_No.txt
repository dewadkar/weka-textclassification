            When I saw the Quest van 4 yrs. ago I was hooked. The styling, ride, and size were perfect for a mom with 4 children.  But looks are not everything.
 A month after buying this XE model new the problems started.First the housing for the brake lights failed and we had no Brake lights of course we had to argue the point with the service manager that of no fault of our own the fell apart. And what do you know two weeks later we received in the mail AN offical recall for the brake light housing. At 35000 miles On A nice family trip through 106 degree weather our fuel pump went out. Nothing could be there for three days.
And between Then and now we have had all sorts of electrical problems.Now the window washer motor is out thats 450 to fix. And two days later the whole heating and defrost system went out.
 This I feel is not an isolated incident we have relatives
and a close friend who have experianced some of the same and other problems with there QUEST xe,gxe.   The only up side to this van is the ride ,handling and engine.  And also the comments of what a nice looking van we have(want to buy it? I laugh to myself). Lou LOU<br><br>
