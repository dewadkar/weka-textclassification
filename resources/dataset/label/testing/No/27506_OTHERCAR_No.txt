            I bought this camera in October '01 on eBay. I bought it from an electronics dealer who sold it to me, brand new, in box for $169 + $11 Shipping. This is still a good deal, 10 months later, but as I found out, I was paying a price for going cheap.

The camera performed well initially. I took daylight test shots at the 2.3MP setting using medium compression. I bought a 128 Mb compact flash and never had the problem of running out of memory ( the 128 Mb card holds well over 220 pictures at 2.3 Megapixel/medium compression)

Then I started taking night shots with this camera, and what a disappointment that was. The flash field is not even, and the objects in the center of the viewfinder get totally washed out if you get too close. The LCD if fairly accurate but the viewfinder is not.

I also had problems with battery life until I switched to the Lithium batteries recommended for high drain devices such as this. The one good this is that this camera comes with an AC adapter, and if you don't but a card reader, like I did this adapter saves precious battery life when downloading pics to your computer. 

But these drawbacks are not all that bad. What disappointed me the most is a glitch in the camera design that cannot be pardoned. If I take 1 shot and quickly turn the camera back off, the camera goes into "Zombie" mode. By this I mean that it keeps taking pictures one after another, and the timestamp shows 12/31/2069. I think there is a glitch in the design that causes this. And it happens often , not just on some days.

I took this camera on vacation, and in a setting where I was taking 20-30 pictures in an outing this camera's size and performance was acceptable. But, if I take it out for a night on the town or bring it out at a night time, outdoor event the pictures are not anything you would write home about, or email home. 

If you get this camera for under $200 , go for it, otherwise I would say go a little pricier and get a comparable Canon or Nikon, you will get a lot more for your money.
