            GOOD GOD! Never before in all my life have I been SO embarrassed behind the wheel of my car. First of all let me just say my father forced this car on me and I will never forgive him for this. I abandoned my 1989 Lincoln Mark VII for this disgrace to motoring and let me say I wished I'd have stuck with my Lincoln. Going from a luxury car to a go-kart is a huge down step much like quitting your job as a CEO for a mailroom position. After the first day I woke up that next morning and thought it was all a nightmare, looked outside and there was the nightmare parked in the spot where my beautiful Lincoln used to sit. The inside of the car looks horrible. The plastic "wood grain" looks incredibly cheap and the seats look like someone made them out of a couch from the 1970's. Also the seats are like sitting on arched rocks. The exterior looks hideous and the back end sticks up too far. The headlights are terrible and I constantly have to drive with my brights on. They don't illuminate anything beyond 10 feet in front of me and the fog lights might as well not even be there, they do nothing. The wiper fluid jets are on the wipers themselves and they usually shoot off the side of the windshield rather than on it, so it's not cleaning my windshield at all. The CD player scratched a number of my CD's. Believe me, it was the CD player; there's circular scratches all over them. The car looks like the only car you'd be able to buy at a Wal-Mart in the clearance section because of its cheap look. My Lincoln had chrome bumpers, and accents everywhere with a sharp, fast looking body while this Malibu looks like a huge RC car with it's high rear height. The steering is also very very VERY tight and at times almost impossible to turn the wheel. And this car drains its fuel source in less than four days. Also immediately after taking it off the lot, I needed to repair the transmission. The car refused to start a few times making me late for work and I lost power while driving on a highway, which sparked a few heart palpitations. Also while driving it home one night after it being in my ownership for a few days, a flat tire, and I had to change it at 11 PM on a dark street in the woods covered in trees called Cemetery Road. To sum up my thoughts, I would love to push this car into a ravine and watch it crumple into a cursed ball of twisted waste.
