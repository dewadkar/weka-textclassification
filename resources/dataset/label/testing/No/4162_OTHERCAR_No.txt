            I bought this vehicle off of a guy on AutoTrader.com and I regret it terribly!  

I had wanted an Isuzu Rodeo/Honda Passport ever since one of my buddies bought one.  He had a Honda Passport and I loved it.  I loved the sleek, nostalgic look of it.  The look represents the older look of the first SUV's back when they actually looked like an All Terrain vehicle and not the car look that a lot of SUV's look like today.  So I sought out an Isuzu Rodeo because they are a little cheaper than the Honda Passports.  I found exactly the year and the mileage I wanted.  I test-drove the vehicle and it seemed to be all right with the ride and handling.  In hindsight, maybe it was just the fact that I wanted to like it, but a couple of weeks after I bought it I hated it.  Any gust of wind while on the highways seemed to blow it right off of the road.  When taking a corner it leaned way too much, even for a SUV.  There was no privacy from the noise of the engine and the road; you could hear everything, which meant if you wanted to tune those noises out, you had to blast the radio.  The only real plus of this vehicle was the four-wheel drive capability.  The pros basically end there.  I didn't keep it long enough to know if something would go wrong mechanically, but I don't doubt that eventually something would have gone wrong.  It seemed to be almost inevitable that something would.  I went with my instincts and dumped it off for something else.
