            Recommended for kids over 3, it really is just a toy. The pictures are really quite lousy, particularly if you have ever used a decent digital camera. But, it comes with a battery! I get a big kick out of the view finder which is just a hole that you look through.

I had some free Internet Cash to spend, and there was a $40 rebate on this. Otherwise, I would not spend more than $10 on it. The twain driver software comes on a floppy disk. When it crashed on Windows 2000, I went to the Little Tikes Web site and the KBGear site to find newer drivers - oh well, I will have to use it on a Windows 98 machine.

Okay, I really shouldn't beat up on this product too much by expecting more out of it than what it is. On the plus side, it takes pictures quickly (because of the low resolution), and the pictures download to the PC quite quickly. The software is entertaining, particularly for the target audience. Also, it beeps about every 10 seconds if you leave it on - not quite an autoshutoff feature, but it helps.

The hair trigger makes it tough to know exactly if you are clicking to take a picture or not. It barely moves like a button normally would, but at least the camera beeps when you take the picture.

If you just want something cheap and easy to take crude pictures, then okay . . .<br><br>
