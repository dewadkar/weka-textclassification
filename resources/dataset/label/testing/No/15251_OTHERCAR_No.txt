            I bought my 1991 Grand Am in November of 1995 for $6,750.  Thought I was getting a deal since it only had 34,000 miles, it now has 128,000 miles.  I think now the only reason the mileage was so low is that it stayed in the shop all the time.  In the 6 1/2 years I have owned this car, we have put about 8 to 10 alternators on it.  It goes out at least once a year sometimes twice and there is no warning it just goes and I better pray I am not far from home when it goes or I will be calling someone for a ride.  We put a water pump on it shortly after I bought it.  The console top was broke when I bought it.  In the last two years things have gone down hill rapidly.  Replaced the timing chain in Dec 2000 $225 and again in Jan 2002 $250.  Now it is Feb. 2002 and I am told it needs a new oil pump $400.  The air conditioner had to be worked on last summer 2001 $250+.  The radiator tank is leaking $150 to fix this.  My husband hates to replace the plugs and wires because the ignition coil is under the motor.  Also within the last two years we have replace the power pack (ignition coil) twice $400 in all.  And with this, we had no warning.  You go out in the morning to go somewhere and NOTHING, it run fine the night before.  We had to have the car repainted 6 months ago because the paint started falling off a few years ago.  Luckily my father in law paints cars for a living and only had to pay expenses.  I have had the heater coil replaced and it still drips onto the floor which has ruined the carpet.  The radiator fan went out.  I had the shocks and struts replaced and you could tell no difference before and after.  The roughest ride ever.  The heater doesn't get very warm anymore and the air doesn't seem to be as cool anymore.  When it idles like at a red light or a drive-thru, it runs so rough you cannot even see anything in the rear view mirror it shakes so much.  The driver side window gears have stripped out twice.  I had to have the starter rebuilt in the summer of 2001.  We have gone through several batteries.  This list could get longer and longer.

The thing that makes me so mad about all of this is that I have always taken excellent care of this car.  The oil has been changed every time, on time.  I have spent hours on the weekend hand washing, vacuuming, polishing, waxing and detailing the whole car.  I have had regular tune-ups.  My feeling for this car is a love/hate relationship.  I love the car.  I love that it is paid off.  But I hate the work that I have had to do, repeatedly sometimes.  And I hate the money that I have had to spend on it in repairs.  And I hate that I don't dare drive it out of town because I don't trust it and I can't depend on it.  My husband has worked on it so much (which has saved us several thousands of dollars) that he is begging me to buy a new car.  I have missed hours of work because of it being broke (which causes me to be broke) and have had to get rides home and to work too many times!  I will never own another Grand Am and wish I hadn't bought this one.  My friend just bought a 2000 Grand Am and she has had to replace the fuel pump on hers already.  I fear what her future will be like.
