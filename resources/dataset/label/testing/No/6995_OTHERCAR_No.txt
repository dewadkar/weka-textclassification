             	A few months back, my Mazda Prot�g� was rear-ended on the freeway&#151leaving it with a rather nasty looking rear bumper that flapped against the rear quarter panel at speeds over 25mph.  After much aggravation from the other driver&#146s insurance company, my Prot�g� was finally taken in for repairs and I was provided with that terrifying thing&#151A RENTAL CAR.  Not just any rental car, mind, but a Chevy Cavalier.  A purple one.  Now, as my online reading tells me, the Cavalier sells for around 12-14,000 dollars, popularly equipped.  The same money will get you a Civic DX, a Prot�g� DX, a Dodge Neon, or just about any Suzuki, Hyundai,  or Daewoo.  After driving the Cavalier for four days, I was left scratching my head as to how Chevy manages to sell this car.  I theorize that there is a joint conspiracy between insurance companies and General Motors&#151Chevy churns out the Cavalier, insurance companies provide it as a rental, and by the time car crash victims are returned to their own vehicles they are so grateful that they don&#146t notice the mismatched paint or shoddy work done by insurance company body shops. 

But I digress.  Lets take a look at the Cavalier.  Ahhh&#133.beauty.  The exterior looks like someone started making a car and then just stopped.  There are just too few &#147pieces&#148.  The front end has two headlamps&#133a hood that swoops down and doubles as a grille, and a bumper.  No trim anywhere.  The sides are the same.  Two doors, two fenders. No molding, no metal beneath the doors.  A complete lack of attention to detail is evident everywhere you look.  

Now, lets go inside.  The driver takes a seat on foam upholstered in polyester tweed.  The seats have ZERO support.  Better have a chiropractor handy if you drive the Cavalier more than 20 miles.  Then there&#146s the dash&#151a sea of cheap plastic punctuated by clumsy looking knobs and buttons.  Its as if a Power Wheels  car grew up.  

If all that hasn&#146t scared you off&#151fire the baby up.  Hear that purr? You&#146ll find yourself wondering if one of the options is a leaf catcher.  Sound dampening material was obviously thrown into the same value-engineering trash can as exterior molding and fresh styling.  Hit the gas, and the engine sends out an ominous groan&#133the driver will be puzzled where the noise is coming from as the car barrels toward sixty with the acceleration of a golf cart.  Braking was acceptable, but the car took bumps like a hay wagon. 

In short, the Cavalier is an embarrassing attempt by Chevrolet at creating an economy car. This car is to automotives what polyester is to fashion&#151it may be practical, but no one will admit to having it. For the car buyer looking to spend $12-$14,000&#133pass up the Cavalier and look at any of the other similarly priced alternatives.  With depreciation figures that will send your accountant out for Valium, your money would be better spent on a certified pre-owned import.
