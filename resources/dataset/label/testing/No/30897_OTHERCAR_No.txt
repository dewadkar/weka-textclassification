<TEXT>
            I bought a 91 Tercel DX with 87 K miles for about $5,500
including all taxes/tags from a dealer in PA on 3/96.
I sold it with 115 K miles in Atlanta on 12/99 for $3,300.
---
I had a couple of problems along the way:
* fixing oil leaks = $1,000
* replace starter = $100
* emissions problems (electrical) = $500
* dead battery = $50
Total cost of ownership = $2,000 over 3.5 years (about $535/year)
excluding gas, insurance, regular maintainence.
It was driven about 28 K miles or 7,500 miles/year.
---
Other than that it gave me no problems.
I took it for all regular maintenance.
I did learn that selling it on my own was much better
I got <b>$1,500 OVER</b> what CarMax offered me ($1,500)
AFTER all expenses related to advertising/cleanup/etc ($300 - 400).
---
I needed a small car that was reliable, fuel efficient,
and low maintenance since it was my first car.
It was recommended by Consumer Reports as a good buy under $5 K.

I averaged 30 mpg for combined city/hwy driving.
It started at about 32 mpg and ended up at 28 mpg when i sold it.

Its good for a single person (not for a family).
Its too small, underpowered, and unsafe for carrying kids around.
It has a 1.5 L 80 hp engine that I could not take over 65 mph
without feeling some loss of control on the highways.
---
I upgraded to a 95 Mitsubishi Galant when I got married.
The Tercel took over 3-4 months to sell - I advertised in the local paper during a decent economy.
Yahoo Classifieds did not seem to help much.

It sold for half of what I bought it after 3.5 years and 30,000 miles.
