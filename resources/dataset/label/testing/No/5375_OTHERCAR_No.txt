            I bought a 1994.5 Limited Edition Nissan Sentra as a program car under 8000 miles in 1995.  It's a compact... as a 6'-2" tall person, it feels a little cramped.  But it was all I could afford, so I drove it ever since (still driving it as of Sept. 2002, actually).  It ran near-flawlessly for 130,000 miles, and then it very dramatically started falling apart all at once.  The Alternator is the weakest spot in the car - it's located too close to the exhaust manifold, causing it to literally burn up and die prematurely.  I've replaced the alternator twice and the alternator's wiring harness once (expect to replace the alternator every 40-60K miles).  This is a design flaw on Nissan's part, nothing you can do about it.  Another weak spot is the cup holder.  If you slam on the brakes and spill Dr. Pepper all over the shifting console, the cup holder is positioned in such a manner it first splashes all over the controls on the dash (which jammed the a/c switch), and then it runs down into the shifting linkage and jams the transmission shifter(not a good thing).  Other rapid wear spots: the front brakes (every 30,000 miles) and the front tires (never got more than 2 years out of any tires on the front - caused two accidents, including a 75MPH spinout on I-80).  The rest of the car ran like a clock, until it rolled over 136,000 miles... and then KAFLOOEY!  The alternator (again), a fuel injector, the ignition (cap/rotor/wires), a fan switch, and the blower motor (the fan for the heater & A/C), all gave out within 30-60 days of each other.  The parts alone were about $400 (and that was after shopping/haggling for budget parts), and I was fortunate enough to have the skills to fix it myself... if I'd had to pay a mechanic to put everything in, I'm sure the total repairs would've been over $1000.  I was very surprised... up until that point I had been very happy with the car.  Now I'm wondering when it'll break down again; I no longer trust it for a long trip.  All the fluids leak too (I have to add a quart of everything every 30 days), the passenger seat's jammed, and the moulding's falling off the side of the car (but none of those prevent it from not running anymore).  Yet up until 130,000 miles I would have recommended it.  Today's cars (especially at today's prices) should be able to go 150,000-200,000 miles without these types of problems.  I'm a bit disappointed having invested 7 years of $200-a-month payments in it (AND I'M STILL PAYING FOR IT!), and  maintaining it religiously.  It should have done better.
