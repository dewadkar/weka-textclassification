            I am writing this letter our of desperation to alert consumers of an incident that happened to me. My family purchased a 1999 Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner in Nov. 1999. On Jul. 21, 2000, I was involved in an automobile accident while traveling on Hwy 25S and another vehicle pulled out in front of me. I was traveling approximately 65mph with my cruise set at 64 when the front of my truck hit the passenger side of a 1991 Caprice Classic and my airbag did not deploy. The truck's front end was demolished.  

That afternoon, I contacted the Toyota Customer Assistance Center to report what has happened.  I was told that it would be 3 working days before I would be contacted regarding the airbag.  

Approximately 4-5 days later, someone contacted me from Toyota and they stated that they would be able to examine the airbag within 2 weeks.  I expressed to her that my insurance company would be making a determination on the vehicle soon and if they opted to repair the truck, I did not think that they would allow it to sit at the body shop waiting on them (Toyota).  She then stressed to me the importance of not repairing the truck until they had a chance to examine it.  I told her that she needed to talk with my insurance company to inform them of their plans for checking out the truck.  She dismissed the thought of talking to my insurance company almost immediately.  

Two days later someone from my insurance company contacted me and informed me that the truck was a total loss and that it would be moved to a salvage yard the next day.  I then telephoned Toyota again relaying this information.  This time the representative that I spoke stated that it would take approximately 30 days before someone could come and look at the vehicle.  I told him that my insurance company stated that they allow the vehicle to remain at the body shop if Toyota agreed to pay the storage fees.  He just restated the time frame (30 days) it would take their person to come and examine the vehicle and reiterated that the vehicle should not be repaired before they got here.  

I asked if they could designate someone from the local dealership to come and check out the vehicle.  He stated that the mechanical repair people at the dealerships are not qualified perform the necessary test on the vehicle.  Toyota has hired people who are specialized in that area and they are few and number. He went on to state that my type situation is one that rarely occurs. 

I went through the preliminary to show you how I came to this point.  It appears to me that they are shooing me off because I am just &quot;one&quot; individual.  Toyota supposably builds high quality automobiles and I am very disappointed that they would not want to take it serious or of high level importance that there may be a defect in one of their best selling automobiles. I am astonished that they would wait until a fatality before they would even move. I understand recalls cost money, but to me the life of an individual is something money cannot buy.  

Product makers always want to appear in their advertisements as if they are interested in the satisfaction of the consumer and the preservation of the quality of life when really it is all about money.  

This letter is just to let other Toyota owners know if the same or similar situations unfortunately happens to you, do not allow Toyota make you think that it is an isolated incident like they did me!  And do not let them shoo you off.  

I will not be quiet about this until they check those trucks out! Because something is definitely wrong.  They cannot tell me that the sensors did not go off because the truck was not hit just right to set them off, because the motor was pushed back to the front wheel of the truck.  This is just a letter for information purposes. I not saying you should not purchase a Toyota product, but bear this in mind.<br><br>
