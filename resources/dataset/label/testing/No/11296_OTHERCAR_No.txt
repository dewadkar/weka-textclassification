            First of all, because I have so many bad things to say, I'm going to say that I love my car. It is a very cute, very sporty, big car in a little car's body. I love the way it looks and, usually, love the way it drives. The bad thing is that for a car I love so much, I would drop it in a heartbeat if I could manage to get my money back. I honestly feel as though I've been swindled. The Protegï¿½ 5 that I currently have is my second one. Not because I liked it so much that I needed another, but because the first one was so bad that they tried to appease me by trading me into a second, identical car. The first car had a horrible rattle from the time that I bought it. I was told that they would find it and fix it and all would be well. To make a very long story short, after multiple tries and "help" from the regional customer service representative from Mazda I was told that there was nothing more Mazda could do. The dealer, though, who was fabulous, was determined to fix the problem, so, at much cost to them, they got me a brand new car identical to the first. This car not only has the exact same insanely loud rattle in the door, but has three new noises. An Alfred Hitchcock-esque creek from the back door, a very high frequency buzzing from the sun roof controls and, just this morning, an awful grinding when the driver side window goes up. But, unfortunately, I'm stuck with this one because I don't want to bother the dealer even more (since it isn't his fault) and I didn't want the original, because, in the end, they (both Mazda and the dealer) had caused significant damage to it in "fixing" it. So, two identical cars, both having what I would consider to be very significant quality issues. My suggestion would be to think very, very carefully about spending money on a Mazda vehicle. I know that if I ever manage to work my way out of this one, I will never make the same mistake again. Please take this seriously, I really don't want anyone else to go through what I have been through and am still in.
