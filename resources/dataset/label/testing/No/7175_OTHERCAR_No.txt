            Grossly underpowered. Those are the words that come to mind when I think of the 1991 Toyota 4Runner that I've had since I drove it off the lot in 1991. I have a manual transmission, 4WD, V-6 with all the bells and whistles. I take it skiing once in a while and I've been camping with it a few times. For the most part, though, this vehicle has been taking it easy on pavement. This vehicle is so underpowered that the motor blew going down the freeway at 70 mph in fifth gear. Yes, the road was flat. When I took it to the dealer, they weren't the least surprised. They said it's common with the earlier models because they are so underpowered. Thankfully, that was years ago and at 58,000, it was still under warranty by 2,000 miles.

I'm about to turn in this truck to buy something from another manufacturer. If you see my car on a used car lot, please don't buy it. Save yourself. Run away! Run away!

By the way, if you think this truck is big inside. You're mistaken. The bed is big, but the passenger compartment is completely cramped. Anything larger than kids in back gets to be a stretch.<br><br>
