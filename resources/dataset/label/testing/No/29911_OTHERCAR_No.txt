            NOTICE:  My poor, ailing car finally died the last death on the way to being traded in for a much younger, prettier model.  It had 105,000 miles on it.. and I had to tow the poor old bag into the Honda dealership.  I patted the ol'gal on the windshield a few times in goodbye and ventured off with my new car.. the <b>2003 Honda Civic EX</b>.  Do I feel guilty for ditching the poor girl in a strange place to be ripped apart for parts?  A little.. She was still my first car, and I'll raise a libation to her memory...  But first, I wanna look at my new and shiny Civic!!

-----------------------------------

This is going to be long.  This is the story of my love/hate relationship with the first car I ever owned.  When I turned 16, I got my barney-purple colored Sunfire SE Coupe.  I babied this car, that's what my father instilled in me.  Change the oil every three thousand miles, follow the book on service, and your car won't let you down.  Well this one did, repeatedly.

At 2000 miles my powersteering hose blew.  Under warranty, no big deal.  Got it replaced, was without a car for three days, whatever.  Somewhere under warranty the A/C blower died, again, no biggie.. under warranty.  At 30,000 miles the alternator blew.  At 36,500 miles the engine block cracked (never been in a front end accident, the mechanic was so shocked.  Pontiac told me it was over the 36,000 mile warranty, so tough luck).  At 38,000 miles the alternator blew again as well as the powersteering hose (also, again).  At 45,000 miles the A/C blew.  Not something cheap, however.  The evaporator (still isn't fixed).  At 50,000 miles the transmission dies.  Not just $200 dies, $2000 died.  About two days after, the starter broke.  Two days after that the alternator blew again.  About two days after, the third battery I've had in the car exploded, litterally.  At 53,000 miles the starter breaks again (please keep in mind this is ALL Pontiac parts serviced by Pontiac technicians, except for the transmission, which was Aamco).  At this point in time I am told that I have a leak in a transmission hose.  I call Aamco, they say that's not covered under the warranty.  I tell the tech's I'll take my chances.  At 65,000 miles my alternator breaks yet again.

Right about this point in time I just say.. forget it.  I'll change the breakpads when they squeal, do oil changes every 5,000 miles or so, and just generally neglect the car.

Surprisingly enough, I have 103,000 miles on it and it's running fine.  I don't know if it was just my experience, but my Sunfire has been a constant disaster since the first few months I was driving it.  It was especially difficult that everything that went wrong happened mostly while I was stuggling to feed myself in college (engine block = $900, two alternators = $400 (for the other two I had warranty on them), starter $200, transmission $2000).  I actually had to quit a serving job because my car was in the shop for the entire month of Nov 2000 (transmission, alternator, starter, battery).

I'm surprised it's still running at 103,000 miles.  I'm sure it's leaking out of all different places, and I need to get a lot of things fixed.. but I've spent enough money on this car, I won't spend anymore.  And amazingly enough, through it all.. I still like my barney purple Sunfire, but that's just because it was the first car I ever had.

Now after stating all that, I've been updating some of my reviews to make them more beneficial.  My father paid around $12,000 for this car in 95 -- due to inflation, and I guess the car's popularity (which I don't know how), the retail price has risen to $14,910.  This car had flat out nothing.  I'm not kidding.  It had anti-lock brakes and an automatic transmission.

No automatic windows, no tilt wheel, no cassette player (nevermind a CD player), NOTHING.  Throughout the years I put in an upgraded stereo system, window tint and an anti-theft device (though why anyone would want to steal my car is beyond me).  It is a comfortable ride, however (and I don't know if they fixed this).. in the 95 Sunfire, the only cupholders are in the back seat.

Have you ever tried to reach for your cup in the back seat while driving?  Not fun.  Plus insurance was always a little above average on it -- because it's classified a "coupe" and thus it is more "sporty" than most vehicles.  It comes with a 2.2L/4 cylinder, 16 valve engine with 140 horsepower.  It has a SEFI engine, with DOHC.  

It's always gotten good gas mileage -- always.  It says the mileage is around 26/33.. But I've gotten as much as 44 mpg on the highways (and that's not just a one time thing, that was almost every time I made a long trip on an interstate).  It's fuel capacity is around 15.2, and it does have a goodly amount of trunk space.

So.. some pros.. some cons..  Pros are that it gets good gas mileage (but then again, so do Honda hybrids), it's cheap to fix (a guy once nailed me while I was stopped at a stoplight.  He hit me going 40 mph, totalled his car.  Only did $300 damage to mine), and it's a decent little first car.  Cons are there are much better first cars, this car brakes down like there's no tomorrow, and the layout on the inside of the car could be designed better (cupholders? HELLO?).

And the sad part is, it's not just me who has had problems with this car.  I know three different people who have all owned various model years, and they have ALL had problems.
