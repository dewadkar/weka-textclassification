            Of all of the SUV's out on the market, we found the Isuzu Rodeo to be one of the cheaper looking models available. From the outside, the Rodeo looks very sharp. The curves and molding give it a "classy" look. However, once inside the Rodeo, you'll understand why we felt that the Isuzu Rodeo looked "cheap". It seemed like the company cut a lot of corners on things to make it "more affordable". 

The instrument panel was very basic, as well as the rest of the interior. Lots of plastic everywhere. 

How did it drive you might ask? Well, there's a good reason that its named the Rodeo. It rides like you're in a rodeo. You feel every tiny bump in the road. I realize that SUVs don't ride as nicely as cars, but this was a bit extreme. 

Isuzu tries to sell you on the fact that it has a more powerful engine than the Jeep Cherokee. Horsepower isn't the main item in terms of overall power of a vehicle. There was a real lack of take-off power as well as passing acceleration.

We also got the "run-around" with the Isuzu dealer. After we told them we didn't want the vehicle, they came back with a better deal. Once again, we said "no". Then they asked us how much we could get the Jeep Cherokee for. We told them, and then they left for a few minutes. When they came back, the offered to sell us any vehicle on their lot that had a sticker price of $29,000 or less for the low price of $21,500. 

Seems really fishy when you have to go to this much trouble just to sell your vehicles.

Needless to say, we didn't buy an Isuzu Rodeo.

I would recommend you invest your money in a Jeep Cherokee if this is the price range you're looking for.
