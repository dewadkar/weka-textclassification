               When I first got this car back in 1996, it was braid new off the GM lot.  It was originally a company car.  I thought that the price of $14,000 was a steal, but later that week I found out it was a big ripoff!  It came with the 3.1 V6, Cruise Control, Tape player, Power locks, Tilt Wheel, and Power Seats.  My youngest son, who was eleven at that time, was and still is a Chrysler and Ford fan and did not like the car when he first saw it.  I went ahead and bought it for the company.  
   I like it for the two days but on third day the starter broke!  The starter would get stuck and after the car started it would make the affect of turning the key after the motor was running.  The dealer covered that, but we found out it took them three hours to tell us the car was fixed!  After that I learned that my son was right and I began to HATE the car.  The gas mileage sticker said 20mpg City and 29mpg Highway.  That is one of the biggest lies I have ever seen.  At the very best it got 22mpg.  The motor's acceleration was so pathetic for a V6, that my 1991 Dodge Caravan 2.5 4 cylinder accelerated better.  Later the driver side door started to drag on the door frame and messed up the paint.  The front plate holder broke for no reason.  The cup holders broke.  The tire iron/jack handle broke.  The pin that holds the transmission change making device in place broke.  The driver side door handle in the in side of the car broke and the passenger door broke on the same place later.  The driver side door handle on the out side of the car is about to fall off.  The name car name on the left side fell off.  Two anti-lock brake systems broke along with the car using up brake pads like crazy.  
   Then the company bought a different car.  My oldest son needed a car and I had the DUMB idea that nothing else could go WRONG. BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART.  After my son started driving it he noticed the transmission was kicking and grinding in overdrive, so I had it checked out and sure enough the overdrive was in bad shape.  I told my son that he could get a different vehicle which was my uncle in law's 1987 S-10 with a 2.8 V6 that had only 25,000 miles on it(another GM piece of junk).  Then I tried to sell it my self.  No one would buy it and I wonder why!  My youngest son (the GM hater)turned sixteen and the Caravan, which he was supposed to get, was broke by me driving it to hard, so I gave to my youngest son who wants to chop the car to pieces now because Third Gear is also bad, the torque converter had to be replaced, the anti lock brakes went out two more times, the windshield wiper system does not always work.  The gas mileage is now around 18 MPH on Highway driving.  The acceleration is even worse.  Why did they not put a supercharger in this weak junky motor???  The motor is whining and humming.  I decided to have him drive this car until the wheels fall off and at only 109,000 miles, I'd say it would not even come close to 115,000 miles. 
   I have owned 7 GM products: 5 were bad 2 were good.  I will never buy another GM.  So if you want a real good middle size car buy a Dodge middle size sedan (with either a 2.0 I4, 2.4 I4, or a 2.7 V6 Chrysler motor(not with a 2.5 V6 Mitsubishi)), or a Ford Taurus (with either a 3.0 12valve V6, or a 3.4 32 valve V8(not the 3.0 24valve V6 )). 

UPDATE: In July I finally got rid of this piece of C@$&.  The alternator went up just before I got rid of it!  It had 113,000 miles and the transmission was just about dead.  My son got a 1997 Dodge Intrepid as his replacement for the trade in, which I also like a lot!  I hope it ended up in a junk yard!  I do not miss that car at all!
