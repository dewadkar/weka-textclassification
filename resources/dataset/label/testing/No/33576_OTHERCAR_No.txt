            Why did I buy this vehicle, simple, I was a three time BMW owner; a 1982 320i driven to 150k miles, 1988 325is driven to 100k miles, and a 1990 525ia driven to 110k miles.  All were great rides and great cars with minimum issues. The 525ia was a little weak in acceleration area but quite tolerable. The 325is was truly a kick to drive. 

In 1997 I fell in love with the style and performance of a black on black 528i.  I traded in our 1990 525ia.  Should have known from the start that it was a problem.  Two weeks into ownership headlight(s) blow out on passenger side.  Three trips to the dealership and no results.  While looking under the hood, I touched a ground wire and saw sparks.  Loose ground and one disconnected ground wire. Ten minutes later and one socket wrench, my ground problem was history.

Since then:
1. Door sill on passenger side replaced twice, attachment tabs broke off.
2. Wood trim over glove box replaced once, attachment tabs broke off
3. Trunk release switch failed twice.  I now know how to fix it after the dealer failed to install it properly.
4. Auto trunk release failed and could not override with key.
5. Driver seat came loose from mounts, twice dealer tried to secure it and failed.  I finally fixed it.
6. In 60k miles every light bulb save the fog lights have been replaced. Several replaced twice.  Found another grounding issue in the battery compartment when BMW service failed to find.
7. Periodically jumps out of 2nd gear, dealer cannot find the problem.
8. Both rear window regulators were replaced and the dealer left me with a rattle in the driver side. Three visits to correct one loose screw.
9. Heater controls have failed twice and replaced twice.
10. Steering wheel squeaks and moans. I just had the dealer look at it and his solution was to spray oil into the wheel.  Do you like oil on your slacks? This just occurred two days before writing this review.
11. Black leather has turned "white" in several low traffic areas (back seats), just had all seats re-dyed. (I am starting to believe I have white seats dyed black - very strange)
12. Sunroof periodically will not close, roof moves forward then retracts leaving a 2-3" gap.  Have had to manually crank it closed.  We do not use the sunroof.  Dealer cannot find the problem.

NOTE: I lived in Detroit Metro area and frankly Erhard BMW is the worst dealer of any car, let alone BMW, I have found.  Most of the issues could have been resolved by the dealer.  They even tried to charge me for an oil change and service that was not performed.  I had dated the oil filter and sealed the oil filler cap.

This is truly a fun car to drive, good accel and great brakes but when you spend $45k for a car, you expect quality.

My son-in-law's Hyundai is the same year with approximately the same miles. Back to the dealer only once.

Last week of February 00, I spent $600 to fix several more problems and I had it detailed.  It now sits in the garage and that is where it will remain until I can get past the ethics of unloading a lemon.

My last BMW...think I will try Audi.

Feb 01 Update:
Several more issues developed:
- In mid Feb, the head liner fell down near the back window.  Careful examination found it had never been installed correctly
- Popping out of second gear with more regularity (1 out of 4 shifts) and dealer can find nothing wrong.  Car is off warranty.  I have developed a strange first to third shifting pattern to avoid using second.
- Auto unlock/alarm with keys has quit working. Dealer thinks it is the alarm system.
- The heck with it,we trade.

Feb 01 Update: We now own an Audi TT Coupe with Quattro - review to follow.

Summary: The Audi dealer had a 99 528i also on his lot and he started to list the things that the individual who traded it in had wrong: Fallen head liner, pops out of gear, loss of lighting system,etc. Did not tell the dealer of my woes but almost broke up laughing.  I think my car was more common than the exception I had hoped for.

First time in 19 years I have not owned a BMW.
