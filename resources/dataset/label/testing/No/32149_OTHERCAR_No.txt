            A friend came to town recently, and rented a car while he was here.  His rental car was a Daewoo Lanos.  I knew of Daewoo as a manufacturer of forklifts for Caterpillar, so I was very interested to see how they did when they were making cars. 

I am not interested anymore.

The Lanos is a small car, but considering its' size it does have adequate passenger space.  The car came with standard features, like AC, radio, etc.  The seats were like the school bus that I rode in elementary school.  They were so hard, that I think you would need a chiropractor after about 15 minutes.  They were also made for a person with narrow shoulders and midsection.  The car had a somewhat rough ride, which didn't do a thing to make the seats feel better.  I also found myself wondering how an engine that small could be that loud.  Maybe the Koreans don't have any laws requiring mufflers.  Most of the interior was hard plastic, and there were already a couple of squeaks beginning to make their presence known.    

But it wasn't all bad.  There was legroom, and the trunk seemed to have a nice amount of space.  When you consider the sub-$10,000 price, the features offered by the Lanos are pretty good.  If you are looking for &quot;luxury car&quot; quality at a low price, this ain't it.  But if you are looking for something better than a Yugo, you can get a new Lanos for a reasonable price<br><br>
