            I bought my Honda for it's performance and fantastic quality reputation.
My brand new Honda is less than 90 days old...here is a slice of my experience so far:

Hardware:  interior hardware loose, driver's door pod &quot;floating&quot;

Windshield Seal:  Replaced windshield seal.  Took one week in the shop with me in a rental.

Rust: Rust on top of drivers door, almost hidden by door seal. Had to be sent to body shop to have rust removed and door repainted. RUST!

Brakes:  Brake pedal drops when system is under load eg. A/C kicks in.  Dealer here in Kirkland tells me all Accords of this year/model exhibit same drop.  Extremely unusual for a car this expensive. (never experienced this on any other car).

Rust and Brake problem were reported within first 2 weeks of ownership.  Dealer said rust was &quot;defective tape&quot; with a blistering effect.  This misdiagnosis translated to me putting up with this for 5K miles instead of returning car immediately.
----------------
Extremely distressed about quality profile and the rust problem scares the heck out of me.  Dealer is basically throwing lemon law at me.  My experience could be rare but I would seriously think about this.  I am surprised that I don't see all that many bad Honda quality reports.  Is there some kind of conspiracy...or did I just luck out!  Friend's sister works at Honda plant...states that they have had tons of problems with this generation Honda Accord - and that Honda doesn't seem to care about fixing the many problems.  This is my experience and hope it helps any prospective buyers out there.  If I had could do it over again, I would probably have bought a Camry or Maxima.

I just received a 2 year warranty extension for rust on this car.  It is not transferrable.  Hmmmm so that is to shut me up...and not to address the quality problems this car has????  Nice but somewhat tainted.
------------ 8/31/00  ---------
Both right side passenger door seals have deformed and are puffing out the door.  Two more quality defects!  Will this ever end.  On the plus side nobody has been killed in the car yet. :-)
