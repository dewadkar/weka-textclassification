            My parents bought this car after my sister accidentally broke the clutch of the Nissan Stanza we owned previously. My parents bought the car because it was &quot;cute&quot; and got &quot;good gas mileage.&quot;
My father taught me to drive a standard tranny in this wad of junk. 
I felt like I was stupid because I couldn't shift this car and I kept missing the synapses between gears. After I purchased my Honda Civic, I discovered it wasn't me at all. It was this hunk of junk my parents paid for. 
I don't want to make anyone mad, but this car is not only UGLY, but it is also unsafe. The body materials are sub-standard, and the stereo is hard to hear over the rattling of the tires. The sun-roof is hard to open, the darned thing makes a whistling noise whe you drive into the wind, with it closed. If you sit in the seats for too long, your bum turns to lead. I hate my mom's Kia.
When you are in the driver's seat, you are bombarded with the thought that your head is too close to the wind-shield and that this car would kill you if you were to get in an accident. The stick shift is too far to reach comfortably, the comfort controls out of whack. I like one thing about this car. It has an air conditioner.
I would not buy a Kia Sephia. I would not buy it in a house. I would not buy it with a mouse. I would not buy it here or there. I would not buy it anywhere. I do not think it's worth a D*m. I do not like it Sam-I-Am.
One more thing. The car is one year older than mine. It has twenty five thousand miles less on it. It gets thirty miles to the gallon, whereas mine gets forty. The paint is chipping off of the side view mirrors, the dash-board is burnt to a crisp due to a BAD design flaw.
I hate this car. DON'T buy one.
p.s.- my parent's can't afford to get rid of it. It would wind up costing them MORE to sell it, than to keep it here and let it rot until it's paid off!
