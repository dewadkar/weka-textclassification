            I drive a 99 intrepid as a company car.  My company standardized on the Intrepid so my only choice was exterior and interior colors.  This car now has 48K miles.

Dislikes:

Poor reliability on the power windows:  The driver door window motor has been replaced 4 times.  Each of the other three window motors have been replaced once each.  All have been under warranty however Chrysler said there is not a problem.  The dealer stocks lots of window motors and is fast at changing them out.

Poor performance on the transmission:  The car has been in the shop twice for transmission repairs.  Once it would not shift out of first gear.  The second time it would not shift into first.  Both times it was one of the electronic sensors.  Both were replaced under warranty.  

Likes:

Style, interior room, trunk layout.
