            My wife and I have been Toyota loyalist forever, all of our past Toyotas have been a dream to own because they were built like swiss watches and ran like them. So, after our first child we were looking for a mini-van for our growing family. The Sienna sounded like the perfect fit for us, a family hauler with incredible crash tests and the quality and reliability of a Toyota....so we thought. We went out to get a Sienna when they first came out, even paid over MSRP for the chance to own one (dealers could not keep them on the lot back then). So let's get to the more detailed pros and cons:

PROS:
Engine : the 3.0L V6 out of the Camry is excellent, it makes the Sienna darn fast.
Comfort: The seats are really comfortable!.
Safety: As you know it is one of the safest minivans out there.

CONS:
Cosmetic problems (fit and finish)
Squeaks and Rattles
Brakes
Too much body Roll
Size: I wish it was bigger especially in the back...Honda scored a hit with the larger Oddysey.
A/C
the seats are really heavy to move


Detail of problems encountered: Radio Buttons are all falling off, Side Mirror Fell off, Front Visor broke, Front seatbelt doesn't latch, A/C sometimes decides not to work. Toyota should have placed 4 wheel disc brakes on this Van, IMO it is too heavy for its current brake setup, and my brakes are already shot after 2 years and very low miles.

Luckily we have had no mechanical problems with our Sienna, but our van is not a good example of the great quality and workmanship that we have come to know and expect from a Toyota.
