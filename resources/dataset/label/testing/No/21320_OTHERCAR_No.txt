            Where to begin?? My experience with my brand new 99 Camry has been nothing short of hell on Earth.When I first got the car (BRAND NEW, I might add), I noticed a scratch on the plastic next to the gear shifter. I showed it to the dealer who responded it was better to not replace the plastic, because the mechanics would never be able to re-assemble it correctly. I should have started to get worried then....

Two days into owning the car, the check-engine light mysteriously began to come on and off. I called the dealer who insisted nothing was wrong with the car, that I must have put gas in the car with the engine running. Funny, I hadn't even put any gas in the car yet. 

Next came the driver's side window....One day I decided to go out. I open my window and think nothing of it. I go into a store, but never lost sight of my car through the window. When I came out, I went to raise the front windows. Guess what? My driver's side window wouldn't raise. I looked in the window, to see my track was bent. So for the next week, I got to drive around with a piece of plastic and cardboard in my window, just like I used to do with my 1984 mercury marquis. I went to the dealer, who agreed to fix it. They did however note they were doing me a favor because the damage cleared occurred from &quot;impact&quot;. That's funny because a) My camry is garaged and b) There wasn't a scratch on this tin can of a car.1 month later, the SAME thing happened. Now, they had to order the part, which took a month itself. Plus, they couldn't install it on a weekend (they only do oil changes then) so I had to miss a day of work to get my 99 repaired. According to the guy at the dealership this is a common problem with the late models camry's and corolla's which &quot;Toyota just hasn't bothered to fix&quot; (A dealer said this!!) Also he said there is a problem with the oxygen sensors. Haven't run into that one yet, but I am waiting for it any day now.... 

We haven't even got to the brakes yet.Around 7,000 miles into my terrible journey with this car, my brake light began to randomly come on and off. Concerned about what may arguably be the most single system in the car, I brought it back to the dealership. After waiting for 5 hours to get someone to look at the car, I was told I just needed a little brake fluid and I was good to go. When asked where this brake fluid mysteriously vanished to, I was told, &quot;it happens sometimes on these cars.&quot; After all I had been through, I would believe anything at this point, so off I went. At about 8,000 I began to hear a loud noise akin to a CRUNCH coming from my front end whenever I would brake. Not wanting to believe I had already went through brakes at 8k miles, I continued to drive. At 8,500 miles, the sound became unbearable, so I went to my personal mechanic.Upon inspection, it turned out that not only had I eaten through my brake pad, I had also done considerable damage to my rotor.... This will teach me to ignore a chruchy brake I guess.

Those were the major things, I guess. Some misc. things:

1) The car gets the worst mileage I have ever seen in a 4cyl car. I measured it at an average of 17 mpg. But clearly, when you drive it you understand why. The engine is much, MUCH too small for such a big hunk of car. I have no doubt that the engineers who slapped that undersized engine in that car stay up at night laughing at all the fools who would buy that car. 

2) The car accelerated so slowly that the car is literally a hazard when trying to get up to highway speeds. Many a time my life has almost been snuffed out from me, all because my car just didn't want to play on the highway. To me, every highway feels like the Autobahn, and I am in a go-cart....

3) Around the same time the my brakes started to crunch, I decided to inspect my tires. Guess what?? The two passenger side tires had both developed a disturbing bubble that looked ready to rupture at the slightest prompting. That was a nice $200 repair.

4) On highway on or off ramps, even the slightest of curvature causes a hum to come from the back tires, and the car leans like it is just about to lose control in the back.

5) Cadillac prides itself on the stabilitrac system. I guess Toyota prides itself on its instabilitrac system. I've never experienced a car that can spontaneously bounce  in the vertical plane like a rapper's 66 imapala. Also, I can't say that I have experienced the pleasures of lateral bounce during low-speed cornering. Ever! Everyday, I find something new wrong with this car in a part of it I didn't think possible.

6) Speaking of stability, I have an ABS system that likes to come on when it shouldn�t, but is completely ineffective when it does come on. Anytime I exit the high. And there is a small incline down, guess what?? The ABS kicks on for no reason what so ever. However, one day in December when I could have benefited from ABS, they did nothing. I was driving into work, and took a corner at about 5 mph. I unknowingly hit an icy patch. The ABS kicked in, but did absolutely nothing to prevent my car from skidding over a low curve and bottoming the car out over a brick border to the parking lot. I got out to look at the car, and didn�t notice anything wrong, that was until I went to my mechanic. Which leads me to point 7.

7) That low speed impact over the brick caused the passenger side of my engine sub-frame to shatter and crack. Not dent. Not warp. Not bend. But CRACK. The last time I checked, metal wasn�t supposed to crack like that since the 1890�s and the Titanic. Everything, EVERYTHING about this car is poorly made throughout, from the cheap looking interior to the sub-standard metal for the frame. Again, I am sure many Toyota employees have gotten entertainment and humor from the fleecing of a guy who just spend $25,000 on a car he thinks is going to be reliable, but in actuality is probably worse then a Kia Sephia.

8) Finally, I would find my commute more comfortable if I was sitting in a wooden Watermelon crate then the Camry's seats. My backside cries out in pain everyday at the thought of going back into those seats.Toyota's marketing slogan is &quot;Toyota, Everyday&quot;. I cringe when I hear this. To me, that line is like a prison sentence one would receive for the worst criminal offense imaginable. In summation, I can not stress enough the fact that I would not buy this car. The car is overpriced and poorly designed, and that is putting it kindly. If I can stop one person, just one from buying this piece of garbage, I would at least feel like all that I have gone through wasn't in vain. If you would like to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to email me at j_nuara@hotmail.com, and I can probably tell you even more.Currently I am saving as much money as possible to rid myself of this curse. I am willing to take a $10,000 loss. It is worth is as far as I am concerned.

DO NOT believe consumer reports for ONE SECOND! Every page lists how &quot;Great&quot; the Camry is. This is complete and utter BS. I would feel better riding my dog into work every day then driving this car. PLEASE, PLEASE do not shackle yourself into this car for five years like I did. It is unsafe, and in many many respects unusable. Do not believe the Toyota propaganda.
