            I had purchased my 1995 Dodge Neon in February 1999 after my 1989 Chevy Celebrity (Celebrity it is not, but that is beside the point) died for the last time. I had purchased the car with 49,000 miles on it.

Overall:

My car was very reliable for a long time.  In the past year alone, I had put 31,000 miles on it, due to many Iowa-Texas drives, so I think that is what killed it.  I tend to be hard on cars, and if you are one that drives A LOT, this car is not for you.  It is really good for college students or for first car owners who don't do a lot of driving because it is an excellent value for that purpose.

What I liked:

My Neon Highline had an attractive grey interior, with a really good sound system for being factory.  I had a package that had the racing stripe, along with an optional baby-seat which I could have done without, not having any kids.  What I really appreciated was the storage in between the driver's and passenger's seats.  There was a lot of room there, along with a very roomy trunk.  The entire car was roomy, to put it mildly.

The car gets excellent gas mileage, which is very important.  One thing that I found about driving the car is the fact that it doesn't accelerate too well (I hear newer Neons can come with an optional engine that is a little better with that) but wind noise/etc. is virtually nonexistant.

What I disliked:

This car had textbook Neon problems.  I have heard some had been fixed in recent versions.
--It leaked oil all over the place...that was so embarrasing.  I felt like a jerk if I ever needed to park in someone's driveway.  That was due to a malfunctioning head gasket, which is around $800 to fix.  All I did was fill the oil a couple times between oil changes, and that solved the problem.
--I had to replace the transmission after 60,000 miles.  I don't know a lot about cars, but I don't think a car should need a new transmission that soon.
--The paint chipped and looked really bad.  I have seen a lot of Neons have this same problem.
--The air conditioning went out all the time and there was no way to really fix it (trust me, I tried!).  I filled it with freon all the time, about every other time when I filled it with oil.
--The Service Engine Light was always on, no matter if it was just serviced or not.
--Power Steering Leak...that was an expensive fix!

Beware with the 95 Neon, as it is the first version of the model.  It did last for 116,000 miles, which is good for this car though. But go with a newer version with the bugs out of it.  You'll thank yourself in the end.
