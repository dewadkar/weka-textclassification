            I list a lot of pros for the VW, however the electrical problem I think overrides all positives.  It's just too expensive to fix.  

My husband and I bought this car about 2 1/2 years ago from a dealership.  After about 6 months the dashboard lights went out.  My husband got one of those lights you put into the lighter and it sits in the dashboard.  This was suppose to be temporary but you know how time can be...we didn't get to it until about 2 months ago because we decided to sell it.  

Our mechanic fixed it for about $65.  We thought well that wasn't too bad.  It worked great for one day, yes one day.  Then it would go on and off whenever it wanted to. We brought it back and the mechanic said he was going to have to take the dashboard apart(making labor costly.)  He said it could turn out to be expensive because electrical problems usually are.  He also mentioned the brakes were on their way out and that we would need a new muffler soon.  We didn't want to invest in something that we were trying to sell, so we sold it as is.  (Yes we were honest and let the buyer know about the problem.) 

While we were checking out Consumer Reports (looking for mini vans) I took a peek at how the 95 Jetta does.  Not only does it do poorly but it's on their used cars to avoid list.  It does poorly in the following:

ignition
electrical (big surprise)
brakes 
exhaust
paint/trim
integrity
body hardware

It is also listed as worse than average reliability for that year.

One more negative I would like to mention are the mysterious parts that fall off.  Our car lost the right  hubcap and the right reflector.  The really strange part is my husband and I have noticed these parts missing  on a lot of Jetta's.  We've actually made a game out of it when we go for long rides.  It's as fun as the padiddle game I use to play when I was a kid.  You know when you see a car with only one headlight and you have to be the first one to call it out loud.  Sorry I digress. 

Now I know there are those that swear by VW's so for you fans I will go over the positives:

The car is roomy all around with comfortable seats.  The driver seat adjusts to go further back then most, making it easy for the taller person to fit in it.  

NOTE: a car seat for baby is a bit too tight when seat is rear facing which it is suppose to be until baby is 20lbs. AND one year old.   

It's a fun car to drive and it rides decent.
