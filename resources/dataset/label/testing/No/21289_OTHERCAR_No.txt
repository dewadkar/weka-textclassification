            After my CRX was wrecked by a careless driver, I bought this 92' Camry from my sister-in-law.  The car is low miles but overall I do not like this car very much.

The car has been maintained yet it still gets fairly poor mileage.  Sure, my Honda got 35-45 but I am luck to get 30 on this 4 cyl. Toyota.  I use overdrive, and I do not use the 'Power' feature.

I have also found that replacement parts are EXTREMELY expensive when compared to Honda's.  Used parts are very hard to find and the new ones are outrageous.  I assume that the used parts are expensive because all the Camry's are still on the road, which does say a lot about the overall durability.

Durability is good, but the cost to operate this vehicle is much higher than other cars I have driven.  With this in mind, if given a second chance, I would get a used Honda over a used Toyota.

Pros:  Big trunk, lot's of leg room in front and back, durable, it has a cup holder, quiet ride, might be a safe family car?

Cons:  Expensive to operate, parts are expensive, everyone has one, the 4cyl does not move the car very quickly, poor fuel economy for the engine size, seatbelts do not retract well (although they work fine when on).
