            I purchased my 626 new in September of 1998.  A few months later my breaks were squeaking.  I took it in and they couldn't find a problem. About this same time my husband noticed the paint having speaks in it and the transmission jerking some.  I just blew him off because I thought this is a new car and those things don't happen on a new car.  Well they do!  

Here I am a year and half later with 18,000 miles on my car I have had to have a new paint job (paint was declared by Mazda as defective due to acid rain. The car was brought over on a barge and encountered acid rain), they have never fixed my brake problem (even after they put new brake pads on at 10,000 miles), I have had two air conditioner belts just break into and now I just had to get a complete new transmission.

  I took this car in every 3,000 miles for an oil change and even took it in for the 15,000 mile maintenance where they are supposed to check the belts, etc.  Mazda tried to tell me the the brake pads and air conditioner belts weren't covered by the warranty.  Well most of the time they aren't, but in this case this car was just too young for these types of problems and I had made every effort to keep up the maintenance.  Mazda agreed with me and did cover those two things under warranty.  

I really loved the style, interior and value of this car, but now I wonder if you get what you pay for.  I have heard now of others having problems with Mazdas. <br><br>
