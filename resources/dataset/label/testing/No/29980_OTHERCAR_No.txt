            I have a 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan (owner for 12 months) with 20,000 miles. While it is a nice vehicle and is loaded with all the goodies, it has not proven to be very reliable. The brakes locked up 2 weeks ago, which required a service tow. Then 1 week later the transmission went out
and had to be replaced. Yes warranty did cover the work, but this leaves you high and dry when you purchase a new vehicle so you have reliable
transportation.  When you need a seven passenger vehicle having to pay
$40-$50 per day for a rental adds up especially when you need one over
a holiday weekend. It did take the dealer a couple of days to get the parts.
