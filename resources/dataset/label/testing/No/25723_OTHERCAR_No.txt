            I am an "early adopter."  I'm the guy who buys the coolest thing as soon as it comes out.  OK, that's my weakness.  So, of course, I bought a new New Beetle when they came out in 1999.  I was real proud of myself for saving thousands by getting it from an out-of-state dealer through Autobytel.com.

Then it started.  The window didn't work.  I had to drive across town to the local dealer who told me "Oh, THE window problem.  Yeah, that's a known problem.  We'll have it back to you tomorrow."  

Then the air conditioning failed.  Same thing: "Oh, THE air conditioning problem.  Yeah, there is a bad valve in these.  We'll have it back to you tomorrow."  

Then the sun visor started hanging down loose AND the air conditioning failed again.  Same story from the dealer.  

And all the while, black greasy stuff kept leaking from the bottom of the doors.  I complained and they said: "Oh, the excessive Cosmline(sp?) problem.  Yeah, they put too much in the doors at the factory.  Nothing we can do about it.  Just keep washing it off."  I insisted they open the doors up and clean it out, but they told me that was impossible.  So I kept ruining clothing and trying to stay one drip ahead of the doors.

This went on for two years until the warranty ran out.  Then a little light came on on the dash with no explanation in the owner's manual.  So I called. "Is it safe to drive."  "As long as it's not flashing.  Just bring it in.  We'll fix it."  When I brought it in, they said "Oh, THE oxygen sensor problem.  Yeah, that's a known problem.  That'll be $500."  What?  A known problem and I have to pay $500?!  

Then the left headlight went out and I called about getting a new bulb.  "Oh, you can't just buy a bulb.  The entire assembly must be replaced and it involves removing the battery.  I wouldn't recommend putting it in yourself; if you break a plastic mounting clip in the process, the repairs are very expensive, so we recommend you have out mechanics replace it.  It will be about $300."  FOR A HEADLIGHT!  

That was the last straw.  Although the car had a 100,000 mile power train warranty, it seemed everything but the power train was failing.  I advertised it for what Kelly Blue Book said it was worth.  No calls.  Lowered the price.  No calls.  Lowered the price again.  A couple of calls but no real interest.  Finally I drove it to a Toyota dealer and traded it in.  

The lesson in all of this:  Don't buy a 1999 New Beetle, or any other car the first year it comes out.
