                 I purchased my 1999 KIA Sportage back in February of this year, it was the first brand new car I ever purchased and I was very exited about my purchase. For about 2 months I was really happy with my Sportage Ex. I liked the way it drove, the way it handled and loved the looks of it. Then the problems began, although none of which were all that serious the six trips to the dealership within the last four months were certainly an inconvenience. First it was the brakes, the pedal was fluttering whenever I would hit them, it was a part in them which had cracked and made braking all but smooth. The next week it was the check engine light, I was told by the dealership that I must have filled the car with the engine running, or didn't put the gas cap on tight enough, whatever, they reset the computer. While I was there I had them fix some things that were not done right when I received the car from the factory, like reset the rear power window which  went up and down rough causing a slight scratch in the window, fix my outside lock that had fallen into the door and touch up a nik on the inside back door, which they never did as they didn't feel responsible for. Since this first time in for service I have had the truck back 4 more times for the check engine light, since they have found loose or bad parts under the hood. Then there was the recall in which they called an upgrade and now it is the cable to open the hatchback. I could actually go on and 3 of the times I had it in for repairs I was given a rental car and I'm sure KIA was billed for the waranty work. Wouldn't you think they would get it right the first time? When you buy a new car you don't expect to have to spend so much time at the dealership, I now know the service manager by name. Well it is time for another visit to the service dept. and another day off waisted or at least half of it. So if you have nothing better to do with your time, go ahead and purchase this car, it does ride well and looks great and if yo<br><br>
