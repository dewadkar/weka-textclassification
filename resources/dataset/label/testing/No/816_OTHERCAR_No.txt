            I was wanting to buy a digital camera to take on our vacation. Much to my dismay, I found only one camera for sale in a 40 mile radius. I purchased this camera looking forward to having a fun filled picture trip, only to find out it sucked all the juice out of the batteries 10 pictures, before it was full. I purchased new batteries, several times and within an hour the camera ate the juice out of them also and by the time I got to my picture taking location I was unable to use the camera to take the pictures. I got to where I put the batteries in on location, so I could at least get some pictures, before the batteries died. It continued to get worse and now 1 1/2 years later, we have trouble getting it to turn on to even take pictures, rather with batteries or plugged into the electric. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
It did take beautiful pictures when you could get it to work and the adjusting lens was nice, because you could aim where the right amount of light was to get a real good picture. It unloaded well into my computer again, when you could get it working. I feel there is something wrong in the on-off switch causing this problem. This is my personal experience.<br><br>
