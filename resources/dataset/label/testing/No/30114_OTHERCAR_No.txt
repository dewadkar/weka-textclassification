            I first saw my stratus parked in the used section at a Chrysler dealership.  It is orchid in color and mysteriously caught my attention.  My first impressions were incredible and I immediately purchased the vehicle.  The power from the Mitsubishi V-6 is incredible and the automatic is flawless.  I found the luxury features such as the height adjustable driver's seat, lumbar support, etc to be more than adequate for a machine of this price range and size.  One problem with the drivers seat is the amount of leg room and lower back support for anyone over 6'0".  Now, about the reliability, everything for about the first 10 months operated perfectly until I moved to northern Montana and realized that this car was never intended for the cold weather.  The doors will just pop-open while your driving and are almost impossible to shut when the weather drops below freezing.  Also, it stopped giving heat and would repeatedly stall at any speed.  The mechanics at a dealership said that it was just the cold and should wait until it warmed-up outside.  The worst problem has to be the CV-axles, tie rod ends, and the hub and bearing assembly.  I got them all replaced for about $1500 and found that they only last about four months between replacement.  Luckily they are all warrantied by Dodge and I was only left with some labor charges.  I would not recommend this car to anyone that lives in a cold weather area.
