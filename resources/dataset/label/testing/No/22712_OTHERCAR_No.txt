            Being a previous owner of the 1995 Plymouth Neon, I can honestly report that owning this car was nothing short of a horrible rollercoaster ride. Not only was the car itself unreliable but also the dealership maintenance in two different counties were extremely poor.
  
My main reasoning on deciding to purchase the 1995 Neon was plainly due to the fact that I had no credit and they were the only dealership in my city willing to take my 1985 Nissan Stanza in on a trade.

At first, I was excited that I was able to purchase my first car on my own with no other financial help other than the dealership. After owning the vehicle for about a year my excited fell to disappointment. I soon felt as if I was another blonde which the dealership could take advantage of for the next five years because of my signature.

In the five years I had the car in my possession, I found out from my own research through Plymouth and consumer reports found on the internet, free to the public, that the 1995 Plymouth Neon had 52 technical recalls. Not only did I find the technical recalls but also had 4 major recalls on the car. Not once did I receive a recall notice from the dealership. Only through my own efforts, I would find out such important information about a car that I trusted not only my life with but my child's life and any others who were to be within this car as well. 

I did have one accident with my 1995 Plymouth Neon which was a head on collision and I can honestly tell you that the air bags DID NOT deploy due to the fact that while my car was at the dealership for maintenance on the steering column, maintenance crew deactivated the driver side air bag and did not reactivate them when they finished the work according to the repair shop who fixed the front of the after the accident. 

I don't belive anyone should buy this vehicle because it is simply a waste of money and a waste of time. A life is not worth the effort.
