            I purchased my 1996 Pontiac Grand Am SE (2 door V6 Auto)in May of 1998, and for the past two years, I have had nothing but trouble.  The first thing to go was the air conditioning coil ($500 to replace plus labor), and next were seven engine lifters ($1300)and the front brakes.  A year later, the alternator and battery went simultaneously.  Months after, the rear brakes went.  Now, taking into consideration that the car, if purchased in 1995, is five years old and has 60,000 miles on it, these repairs would seem run of the mill.  However, the brakes had already been replaced once, and much of the electrical system has failed.  Since purchasing this vehicle, I have put an estimated $4000 into it.  
Gas mileage is fair, and the ride is super smooth.  The sound system is great, and seats are comfy--acceleration is good.  Braking, however, leaves little to be desired. Road noise is also a factor.  
This vehicle is perfect for the teenager-first-car buyer, especially if it will only be driven around town.  Reliability is questionable, and therefore, long distance drivers should look elsewhere.  Be prepared to dump some money into this make and year model.
