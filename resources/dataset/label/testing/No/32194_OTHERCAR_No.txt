            Well, I was lucky enough to be able to find a car within my price range. I had enough of *buying someone else's problems*, so I opted for a new vehicle!  I put on alot of miles for work, so I felt I should have a reliable car.   However, it seems like I am either calling into the shop to get some type of squeak, rattle, and noise check out more than I did with my older car that had over 100K miles on it.   I have had the brakes rotars worked on, the recall for the hoses, noises of bubbling from the radiator( I was told are *normal*)  I was soooo excited to get hits car. thinking&quot;Oh wow, great price, reputable brand, sporty looking&quot;.  Well folks, I NOW believe...You do get what you pay for!  I guess next time I am going back to a FORD!<br><br>
