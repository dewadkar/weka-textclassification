            I bought my 1990 Eclipse early last year, and it's been almost 2 years. ...but it was only the first half year that was running good. 
I wanted to buy a nice, sporty car, and it had it all-- for inexpensive price; Beautiful, Fast!,Super clean, Cold A/c, Great Sound system, Comfortable (front) seats, loaded...was so perfect. only that it had 200k miles.(the seller told me that they got a new engine so that the mileage supposed to be only 5ok or whatever.)
Well, I should've known better, but the dealer told me that someone else wants to buy it if I don't get it today...Stupid me, I rushed and bought it quickly. I still regret the day till now.

One day on highway, one of the hose busted and the the green coolant spewing out from the hood with the white smoke, and it died out.
I remember, it was the first step for me and my poor baby to the hell. 
A few days later, the car died out again on the same highway.
Soon after that, the car started making clanking noise, and it became louder and louder. A mechanic told me that the engine was going bad.
I first did not meet a good mechanic for one thing, I spent over $500 for near nothing. Nobody really could figure it out what is wrong with it...

I never forget the day that I was almost crying when I decided to bring  poor eclipse back home by driving it from a sorry mechanic. It was only 35miles long trip, but I had to put the emergency winker on and go with 35-40mph...
The car was making a horrible, clanking sound that it sounded like it is going fall apart any minute into pieces.

I also changed timing belt. the car worked okay for a few days and died again.

My baby car finally recovered after one month of intensive care from one nice mechanic, costing me almost another $900. She was doing great while I was pregnant and when my family came to see the baby...
After my family are gone, she suddenly stopped being nice again. I really don't know what made her angry this time, I cannot afford to repair the car no more, it's been sitting at my house almost a year now. I feel bad, and am going to finally fix it and this time, I will sell it to someone very cheap. I just want to get rid of it.

Very pity...It looks so beautiful and fully loaded with all the options.
IT WAS SO FAST I COULD BEAT ANYBODY!
However, if it is not running good, it is just a piece of junk.
(I actually get in the car sometimes just to use the stereo because it got a great sound system!)

I only found out later that the car had recall for automatic seatbelt (from Mitsubishi,since Nov,2000), and hear that many eclipse has weak engine and does not last long,,,,my eclipse is not an exception, either.
In my case, it may be just because of the mileage though, if the seller told me a lie that it has a new engine...
Please, be extra careful when you see a sport car that looking so perfect...dealer wants to sell a good-looking car, not dependable car!
