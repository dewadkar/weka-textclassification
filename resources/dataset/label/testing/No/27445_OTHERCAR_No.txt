            I purchased this car on a cold rainy day. Used, it showed 84K on the dash, 6 months later with a lot of daily driving, only shows under 86K. I normally drive 30K a year. We had several other cars to choose from. I initially, like the HP, and room. I could tell the prior owner smoke severely. I cleaned this car up really well. 

After about two days, I noticed the speedometer, and odometer stopped working. If the car was at cold start these items worked for about 20 minutes. After the car was warmed up, or the weather was warm enough, the odometer, and speedometer never worked. Get a cold front, they might. 

I do most repairs to every vehicle I own. I bought this car in Nov 2000, gone through a caliper rebuild, and three sets of front pads. Only the passenger side wears out. 

To correct the infamous wind problems, I roll my windows down a bit and roll them back up. I found that the windows get caught on the outside of their seals, and opening the window and up again repositions it. 

I also, refilled the ac with a $30 kit from Wal-mart. Refill the freon, and now the ac works great. Sorry to hear the other complaints about the ac. 

This car has great gas mileage without ac being used. Engine is pretty solid. 

I know there are at least 10 recalls on this car, but I don't desire to keep this car long enough to take it in myself. 

I can't speak for the newer models, but I don't know whether to recommend this car or not.
