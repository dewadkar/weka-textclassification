            My husband and I finally decided it was time for a minivan.  With 2 small kids, we didn't want a little car anymore.  We decided on the Villager.  We bought a 94, used.  

At first we loved it.  Lots of room up front, but the middle and back seats were cramped.  Great for traveling with the kids.  Very comfortable.  But after a couple of years, the check engine light kept coming on.  We took it into a shop, and found out that the headers needed to be fixed, and we had an exhaust leak.  The mechanic then told us that Villagers were notorious for these kinds of problems, and more than likely a year or 2 later we would have to fix it again.  Here we thought we had gotten ourselves a reliable vehicle that would last us for years, and now we find out that it had serious problems. 

My husband did keep up with oil changes, etc.  

I was happy with it until the problems started.  But it only being a few years old, we didn't expect to have such severe problems so soon.  <br><br>
