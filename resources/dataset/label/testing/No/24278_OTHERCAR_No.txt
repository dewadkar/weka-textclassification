            I bought the car because I thought it looked nice.  It had all the options plus a powerful V8 engine.  What's not to love?  After a couple of weeks, the &quot;newness&quot; wore off and I started to notice some irritating things.  For starters, the air conditioning and the heat worked at about the same temperature (great heater, perfect for cold climates).  It was eventually repaired (on warranty).  Then, the display on the stereo stopped working.  The dealer said it would cost a few hundred to fix and I decided to just leave it for now.  So I now have to guess what station or CD track I'm on!  It wouldn't be so bad, but just because I press the &quot;up&quot; button, it does not mean it's actually going to go up - it may go up, down, or do nothing at all!  

What do I like about the car?  Well, it has a lot more power than GM mid-size SUVs and can give really good acceleration when needed.  But, with the V8 and the All Wheel Drive, fuel economy is very poor.  It actually uses more fuel than my old Suburban did!  I usually end up filling the tank 2 or 3 times a week.  

With all the leather and woodgrain trim, one would think it would be very comfortable inside.  Unfortunately, the front passenger seat is about the only one you can sit in on long trips.  The driver seat gives a sharp pain in the lower back after about 45 minutes.  

I do especially like the 4WD for dummies it has though as it is always ready. It handles snow and ice very well, although it doesn't have enough mass to handle deep snow at higher speeds.  

I don't think I would buy another one.  It always seems to be in the shop for some reason.  It's not a matter of if something will break, it's when.<br><br>
