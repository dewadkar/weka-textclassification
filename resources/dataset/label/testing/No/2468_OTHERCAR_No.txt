            I wish I would have bought my '00 Concorde LXI as a used vehicle one year later.  In 6 months the car lost $10K in value and I see several at local car dealerships for under $20K.  In retrospect, I guess there is a reason for the large rebates and interest rate incentives.

The car itself had numerous squeaks and rattles which I have not had in Ford and Buick (Riviera) vehicles.  Also, the car had an annoying trait of wanting to surge at stop lights.  Your foot better be firmly plastered on the brake pedal.  The dealership told me that this is normal.  Not with any previous cars I've owned.  It does seem to be related to the heating/air fan engaging, but I have not had this problem with other makes.  After driving my Concorde for 3 months, I just felt a real lack of quality (especially compared to my '96 Riviera) after squeaks and rattles began appearing.

I liked the car, but wish I had kept my '98 Eddie Bauer Explorer with 50K miles.  Therefore, after just 6 short months of ownership I bit the bullet and got rid of my Concorde.  Nearly two months later it is still on their lot for $20K with only 7K miles.
