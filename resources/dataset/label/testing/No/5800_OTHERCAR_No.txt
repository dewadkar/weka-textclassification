            Enclosed is the letter we wrote and the response we got back from Pricescan.  You need to read this if you are thinking of purchasing a camera online!  This information is for ALL Camera Buyers 

We used your Dealtime system and Pricescan to check prices on the Oympus D490 and came up with these four companies

 Compdirect  800-9317070
 Camera Zone    888-4051500
 Discovery Camera   888-625-5387
 Camera Sound   800-304-8721(Mike's the Manager)


None of these camera companies have the intention of selling this camera, and a number of other cameras they list at the quoted price, and that's wrong to advertise a price you have no intention of honoring to create traffic.

It's illegal and it's wrong.

 None of them have had the camera in stock for weeks(now months), but their website says they do, and if they do you have to buy expensive add ons.  Another words they have no intention of selling you that camera at that price. Availability should not depend on whether you are buying add ons or not.  You can order it like we did, but they won't send it to you unless you contact them first and that's when the bait and switch strategay comes.

 When you get the same probelm after ordering or when attempting to order by all of these listed companies, it's not by coincidence.

 As a consumer you buy according to price and availability and you shouldn't be scammed into a bait and switch situation.

 Get these companies off your list, or make them honor their sale prices. It's illegal and Olympus as the parent company  takes some liability if in fact their business practices are illegal.

We want a in stock camera  at the stated price from Camera Sound or get it off your list immediately.  Camera Soound has a policy in print on their website they will meet all offers.  Get that off their website or honor it.  We think a month + of this stuff is enough. 

We want the same for all the others we mentioned or get them off  We implore you to check and call these camera shops.  Verify that these companies are selling the products mentioned at stated prices in stock or get them off.

 It's true that all of these vendors will try to sell you accessories and  additional items that you may or may not want.  Since the prices they post  are very close to cost, you can't blame them for trying this.  And it's  true that they may claim the item is out of stock until they are convinced  that you're not going to buy anything else.

 But if you insist on buying just the camera, after much resistance, you  will get the camera for the price they post.  We've tried this, and were  successful in the end.  But I have to admit it takes some degree of  persistence to get the really good deals.
