            So you're all excited about buying a Honda Passport, that nice SUV by Honda... STOP! First let me fill you in on a little secret that seems to elude so many people: <b>the Honda Passport is actually an ISUZU RODEO</b>. That's right. Not made by Honda at all. Honda needed an SUV to get into the market craze, so they asked Isuzu for some Rodeos and stuck on some added cosmetics and Honda stickers. That's IT, folks. <i>The Passport is a Rodeo every other inch of the way.</i> But before I go into this in more detail, read my review about the Passport. This review is based on my experience with a Rodeo, which is the <i>exact same car</i>.

The Passport <b>looks very good on paper compared to the competition</b>: it offers a great engine (3.2L 205hp, 214 torque) that outmuscles the Toyota 4Runner (183hp), Nissan Pathfinder (which shares its 170hp engine with the Xterra), Ford Explorer (160hp), and Mitsubishi Montero Sport (173hp). The Passport has plenty of cargo space (81 cubic feet). 

But does the Passport measure up in real life? After a few days with its clone, I think it pretty much does.

<b>EXTERIOR: 7</b>
The Honda Passport looks <b>rugged yet sophisticated</b>. Isuzu (the original designers) did away with the angular look of the pre-1998 models and still managed to preserve the tough look while adding a bunch of refinement at the same time. So now soccer moms and off-roaders alike will be pleased with the new Passport's pretty, (and rough n' tough) face... 
The Passport is shorter in length compared to its competitors, and even shorter than previous generations. This reduces weight, and helps with parking.
The rear door swings out sideways towards the street, so loading from the curb is a breeze. A glass hatch may be opened alone, so you can load smaller items into the cargo bay. The rear-mounted spare tire gets in the way of this, and is a real pain once it's dirty. But Honda gives you the choice of your spare tire placement (under the floor or mounted on the back).

<b>INTERIOR: 8</b>
Having said that the Passport is shorter than it used to be, it may surprise you that interior space is not compromised. In fact, the new Passport has more room than previous ones by 7 cubic feet. 
The <b>finish is not quite up to par with the pricier 4Runner or Pathfinder</b>, however. The carpeting seems like it can take some abuse, but I still recommend a cargo mat for the cargo bay. 
The seats themselves are comfortable, although I wish that power adjustments were available. My friend loves the low step-in height for an SUV, however.
The dash of the Passport is very <b>user-friendly</b>, but I wish the radio was higher. The A/C is powerful and uses logical rotary dials. 
The 6-speaker stereo sounds very nice for factory, and the in-dash CD changer is a welcome option.
My gripe with the dash is the placement of the push-button 4WD: it's right next to the cruise control. I had to be careful not to push it. I was told, however, that if it is accidentally pushed over 62mph, it will refuse to engage. That's good news. 

<b>ENGINE: 9</b>
The engine of the Passport is indeed the <b>BEST feature of the vehicle</b>. There is plenty of grunt to just get up and go. At freeway speeds, it is very easy to pass somebody. Gas mileage for the Passport is 18 MPG city and 20 MPG highway.

<b>RIDE: 7</b>
The suspension of the Passport is decent for the most part. Watch out for uneven surfaces and potholes, however. The ride gets bumpppppy! I found this a nuisance once we were driving around town. But on the highway, the suspension feels sporty. You feel in control. Speaking of control, the automatic transmission of the Passport has two modes you can select: POWER when you need extra oomph for merging, and WINTER, which starts the Passport off in 3rd gear from a stop during slippery conditions, preventing wheel spin. The engine is much quieter than previous ones. Tire and wind noise are both still apparent but diminished. 

<b>HANDLING: 8</b>
The track of the Passport was widened by two inches, which helps in the handling category. The wheels stay planted during moderate turns, although I felt some lean and heard the tires squeal in sharper corners. 
The ABS work very well on slick surfaces, and brings the Passport to smooth, controlled stops every time. The steering is sure and responsive.
Overall, I feel that the Passport is a fun SUV to drive. The powerful, quiet engine and the wider track make a good combination for city driving or highway cruising.

<b>THE VERDICT: GET A RODEO INSTEAD!</b>
The Isuzu Rodeo got my approval on this site. Again, remember: the Honda Passport is the exact same vehicle with a few added "Honda" stickers here and there. It has the <b>SAME reliability as the Isuzu Rodeo, which is AVERAGE. The Rodeo is CHEAPER than the Passport, and has a BETTER warranty</b>. Still, tons of Passports are sold year after year. This completely amazes me. The only advantage of getting a Honda is a larger dealer network. That's IT. If a Passport is what you wanted, and you want to avoid this evil marketing ploy ubiquitous in the auto market, I recommend you look at the Isuzu Rodeo instead.

<b>AVERAGE SCORE: 7.8 out of 10
VARA'S PERSONAL RATING: 5.0 out of 10 (Rodeo: 8 out of 10)</b>
