            In June of 1999 I bought a brand new (12 miles) 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 2WD 6 cylinder SUV.  I bought this model because I really loved the new body style, and thought that it was the most stylish SUV in that price range.  2 months after I bought the car, in August of 1999, the A/C failed.  I live in Texas, and it is 110 deg. here in August.  Needless to say I was not happy.  I took my Jeep in for repairs, and they said there was a manufacture defect which caused a major leak in the system, but within several hours they had the problem fxed, and blowing cold air again.

I was happy, at least for another 45 days when it happened again.  Went through the same process again, getting it fixed, and off I went, thinking that the problem had to over by now.  

My mistake, it happened again.  Also at this time, the engine developed a nasty sounding clanking sound that sounded like metal hitting metal.  For the clanking sound, I had my SUV in the shop numerous times, and the official word from Chrysler was we don't know what is causing it.  So I turned it in as a Lemmon, never to buy another Jeep product again.<br><br>
