            This is my second VW Golf, and I truly love these cars.  But I wish they didn't break down so often and the parts were not so expensive.  I had a 1987 Golf with the 1.8L but it cost me more to fix it than we bought it for so we sold it.
  
Now I have a 1995 Golf GL with the 1.9L IDI Turbo Diesel (Canada only thing, US did not get this engine, pre-TDI era) and love this engine.  Performance is surprisingly peppy considering it only has 75 HP.  Turbo helps in this area.  I got 60 MPG with straight highway driving and 40+ in town.  

But things are starting to break just like my old 87.  Trim pieces on the front doors (both) are starting to sag.  Emergency brake cable siezed causing the rear brake to drag.  Speakers constantly cut in and out but the wire connections seem fine.  I've had a couple of glow plugs burn out on me forcing me to plug my car in at -5 degrees Celcius or it won't start.  Cruise control always kicks out whenever it feels like it and sometimes won't even work.  

This car has taken it's toll on me.  I've heard that VW's are rock solid until 5 years, then they start to self destruct.  This is true.<br><br>
