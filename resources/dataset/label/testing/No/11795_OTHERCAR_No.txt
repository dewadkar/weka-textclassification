            Even with the Volvo's 3 liter V6 engine pumping out a not-insubstantial 150kw (that's more than the turbocharged Nissan 200SX!), the Swedish-built 960 still takes a surprisingly long 10.4 seconds to reach 100 km/h, and a very lethargic 17.6 seconds for the standing quarter mile.  I guess 1560 kg worth of Swedish luxo-sedan will do that.

The Volvo's styling is very, well... Volvo.  Big flanks of slab-sided sheet metal on all sides make it look about as aerodynamic as a school bus... and about as interesting to look at as well.  Up-and-over door handles add a touch of class, but that's really where it ends.

The interior, with a combination of wood and dark plastics and leather, is just as boxy as the rest of the car and is quite unattractive in my opinion.  Two stars overall.<br><br>
