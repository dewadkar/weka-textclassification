            As with all used cars, it's typical that you're going to run into a few problems here and there and while my car has not died quite yet - with all the repairs I've had, I could've had already purchased a new car!
I went to a Toyota dealer February of 2001 (perhaps my first mistake for purchasing a Plymouth from a Toyota dealer) who had advertised in a local catalog of sorts a '97 Plymouth Breeze, loaded. We traveled down to view the car and check it out. Looked good, felt good, the ride was smooth. I did not forsee any immediate problems with the vehicle.
Lo and behold, the morning after I left the dealership, I drove 5 miles to visit my sister at work to show off my new beaut and as I was leaving (passing through a major intersection), the car kept losing power - "chugging along" I would say. I pulled off to the side of the road. The car was not going to make it home by itself.
We called the dealership and while the car came with no warranty, they agreed to fix it. Turns out that the transmission had to be rebuilt. I bought the car on February 15th and did not get it back until March 7th. Everything was happy again for a few months.
As Florida was approaching the summer months, I still had air conditioning. Coming into July, the clutch on the a/c compressor had frozen up. I spent 220 dollars on a refurbished one to replace it, but it did not come with a "high pressure relief valve," which would be imparative for the darned thing to work. On the original compressor, the piece was bad so I couldn't transfer it. I went to the dealer, who said I would have to buy a brand new a/c compressor to get ahold of the relief valve, I went to a junk yard who told me the same. To this day, I still do not have air conditioning.
And as of recent, while coming home from work I noticed this "metal-grinding-metal" noise coming from under the hood and could not figure out what it was. The next day, my car was towed to a shop where they told me I needed to replace my water pump. After they opened the hood, I also needed to replace my timing belt and a broken motor mount. All in all, it totaled $684.13 in repairs. 
While I am happy with the car in that it still runs well, I am constantly having to check my oil due to it burning off. It's a comfortable ride and at the time, it was a very comfortable price. The car has let me down quite a few times, but it's still rollin'! I would recommend the vehicle only to those who can obtain a warranty on the car and plan on keeping it for a few years, or don't mind shelling out the money for repairs. 
(As of May 30th, the vehicle was valued at 1,000. I still owe 3,000!)
