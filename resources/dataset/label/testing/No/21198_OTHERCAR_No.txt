            From Walmart--$157--good price.  Seemed to have plenty of amenities for the price--at least it SEEMED to....
Lens cover is very flimsy and prone to get sprung.  LCD difficult to see--but this is a given for most digitals.  AC adapter a must because camera EATS batteries.  Memory expansion card is also necessary.  Instruction booklet is not written in much detail.  If these were the only limitations I would still say it was a bargain for the price--but...READ ON.   
Vivitar 3715 took very pretty pictures but refused to upload to my computer.  It would not jive with my Windows '98 at all. I had three computer gurus check out my computer; they tried everything to make the software work to no avail--Discussions with the Vivitar company--downloading various drivers from the Vivitar website--etc etc.  According to the system requirements for this camera and the Vivitar company, it should have worked.  One last try to make a union between camera and computer (Gateway 2000) and the camera started to stink and melted internally--scary.  It started on the adapter side--not the USB side.  So---assuming that something was wrong with this individual camera and/or AC adapter---I exchanged them.  
Second camera STILL wouldn't cooperate with my computer.  So--I bought a new computer with 512 RAM and 80 GB of hard drive plus Windows XP. (I REALLY needed this camera to work for business purposes.)
Guess what?  As soon as I plugged it into my brand-new computer--it uploaded beautifully--and instantly melted internally.  What a STINK!  Yikes!  I was afraid my NEW COMPUTER was trashed (besides my twice assaulted lungs).  Fortunately it was a problem with the AC adapter to camera side again.  However--I am still concerned that my computer may be damaged somehow.
Walmart says this is one of their most returned cameras--hmmmm--I think I know why.  So after ONE attempt with the new camera and new computer...I'm off to return this LITTLE STINKER.  Phew! :(
Maybe I am electronically cursed?  If you buy one--I wish you much happiness with your purchase(s)--maybe the THIRD one is the charmer.
