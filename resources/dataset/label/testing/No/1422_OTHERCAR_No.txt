            I purchased my 1998 Dodge Neon brand new in April '98. I wanted an inexpensive, compact car to replace my '89 Dodge Shadow (which Chrysler stopped making around 1994).

I originally had been shopping for a Saturn, but the Neon was pretty close to what I had been looking for in the Saturn but was cheaper. I also had some brand-loyalty, because my family had owned several Chryslers. (Why, I don't know...)

I shouldn't slam the car too hard though, because I didn't have any real trouble with it until last month, about 2 years and 10 months after I bought the car. As many of you Dodge owners out there already know: I had my first head gasket leak.

For those of you considering purchasing a Neon from 1994-1999, be sure to ask the person you're purchasing from if the car has had a new head gasket yet.

These cars are notorious for having head gasket leaks. Basically, what happens is that oil leaks from your engine and you either have to keep replacing the oil every day or get it fixed to the tune of $900. Just about every Neon needs a new one at some point, and a few unlucky Neon owners have had to have theirs replaced several times. The head gasket will at any time: I've heard of them failing as early as 12k miles! Mine, unfortunately, got through 55k miles before it failed, meaning it was out of warranty by that time.

But, as luck would have it, I found out about a "secret warranty" Chrysler has. It's the company's way of keeping this problem under wraps by placating the Neon owners. All you have to do is take your leaky Neon to a certified Dodge service center (like a dealership) and tell them you know Chrysler has been giving discounts to repair this problem. Suddenly, the $800-$900 price the service manager quotes you to fix the problem will drop to $200. 

I know this sounds to strange to be true, but it is. I did it, and so have thousands of other Neon owners. It's sad that we have to go through this process of researching this kind of sneaky business practice in order to get a fair price, but that's how Chrysler works.

These sites, as well as Edmunds.com were extremely helpful to me... they saved me $700!

Unfortunately, Chrysler's not the only car company that engages in such dishonest and unethical behavior, but perhaps if I had purchased a more reliable car I wouldn't need the warranty in the first place.

If I had it to do over again, I'd spring the extra $1500 or so and get an entry-level Honda Civic.
