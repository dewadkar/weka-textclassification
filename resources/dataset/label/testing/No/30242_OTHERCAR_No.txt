            After seeing all the other bad reviews this shoddy product got I kind of wished I had something different to say.  Since I don't, it occured to me that maybe enough had been said about this camera; our fellow consumers had been warned off.  But I was so utterly disappointed with not only this camera, but also with the service I got from Agfa technical support that I just had to throw my two cents into the fray.

I purchased this camera for 49.95, and the fact that I was getting such a &quot;deal&quot; was the only reason I went for it in the first place.  I have been wanting a digital camera for quite sometime and figured that 50 bucks wasn't a lot to throw away while I was searching for that great digital camera to spend nearly a grand on.  My expectations were not great, after all, how good could a bargain basement product really be?  I must admit that my hopes jumped a little bit while installing the software (necessary to operate the camera because it dosen't come with a TWAIN driver) because of the example pictures included on the installation disk.  I should have know better than to take those things on face value, but silly me, I believed that the manufacturer of a product would not include false example photographs along with their product.  These pictures, about three in total, were great.  They were crisp, bright, in a word - nice.  Never from the camera in question did I get a result even moderately comparable to the &quot;example&quot; pictures; the fact of the matter is that I couldn't really make out what the camera had taken a picture of.

The image I was able to download of the camera (that ate up two double AA batteries; yes, this thing runs on double AAs; before you could sneeze), after much painful effort and not a few calls to Agf a's completely unhelpful customer service department, was completely broken up, pixalized, and useless.  It reminded me of the people's faces they hid on television (like on COPs), it was that bad. 

My first thought was that something was wrong.  Surely nobody could sell a product that failed this badly at accomplishing the task it claimed it could.  I mean, it was supposed to take pictures.  I wasn't expecting sharp, professional quality results, but I did expect to at least be able to recognize the image I was shooting.  So, thinking something was wrong I get in touch with Agfa's Customer (dis)Service Department and upload a picture (I am using the term &quot;picture&quot; flexibly in this context) I had gotten off the camera.  In my accompanying e-mail I point out the rep that in the attached picture he should be able to clearly see the extent of my camera's serious malfunction.  After waiting a couple of days for a response it finally rolled into my inbox.  In one line the rep wrote me that the image I sent him falls &quot;under the acceptable quality parameters for this product&quot; and even had the gaul to suggest that if I wasn't satisfied with the result I might try one of Agfa's more advanced and expensive cameras.

Here's what I did instead - I returned the e-Photo Smile as quick as I could and am now staunchly convinced I will never buy another Agfa product again.  There's nothing wrong with making a cheap digital camera people can afford to buy on a whim, or perhaps for their kids.  But marketing a product that dosn't even take what you could call a picture as a camera is wrong.
