            I bought my Dodge Neon late in the car year 1996.  I looked for several months at them and felt comfortable that I knew a lot about the car when I bought it.  It was perfect for me at the time.  I was single and wanted a roomy and practical car that looked &quot;fun&quot;.  The Neon was &quot;the&quot; car for me!  I loved the styling, the handling, and the size of the car. 
 
This car went on a 700 mile road trip with me more than once.  It got quite uncomfortable during this trip, and we were very sore by the end of it.  During one of our trips, it died in the middle of a traffic jam.  Not a good thing, if you ask me!  The rest of the way home we had to pray it would start when we stopped for gas or a rest area break.  It took mechanics at a Dodge dealership all day to find out that it was an electrical problem.  And this was before the car was 2 years old!  Once fixed though (and it was free of charge due to warranty coverage), I never had the problem again.

Driving this car was a pleasure.  It had plenty of pickup and was a breeze to park, even in smaller spaces.  

We no longer have this car.  When I got married and had a child, this car was difficult to get a small baby in and out of a car seat.  Even with the four doors!  You feel like you are crawling into the car to get the car seat adjusted and the baby in tight.  I bought this car because I thought it would suit the needs of a small family, but it turns out that it did not.<br><br>
