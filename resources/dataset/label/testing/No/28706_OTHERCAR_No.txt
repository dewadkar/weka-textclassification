            On a trip to Toronto over the Christmas holidays, we rented a 4-door 2001 Dodge Neon for a week.

<b>Engine</b>
Mated to an automatic transmission, the Neon was fine for city driving but under-powered on the highways.

<b>Handling</b>
Small size meant that the Neon was very capable in the city. On the highway, the car steered quite neutrally with no FWD understeer. Excellent traction in the snow.

<b>Interior</b>
This is an econo-car so the dash is basic. The 2001 model is a major facelift over the first generation Neon which had a slightly off-center steering wheel. Thankfully, that's been addressed. Seats were comfortable though the dark grey interior and lack of backlit switches made finding anything at night very difficult.

<b>Styling</b>
The Neon doesn't look like any other econo car but it lacks the character that the first generation Neon had.

<b>Overall</b>
In the competitive econo-sedan marketplace, the Neon delivers a spacious interior and a competent ride. I recently rented a PT Cruiser (see my review) which is based on the Neon platform so it's a shame to see that the Neon itself gets all the cost-cutting measures to make their econo car <i>feel</i> like an econo car. The details and touches on the PT Cruiser demonstrate that this platform is clearly capable of a lot more.

By comparison, the Ford Focus demonstrates that an econo car can still feel like a quality piece.
