            After many years of driving the Pontiac Transport, I can safely say that this is one of the worst vans on Earth. Truly when it comes to safety, the Transport is not a bad van. Although roomy, the van gives the driver poor visibility. The unusually-shaped front window makes you feel like you are in the cockpit of a plane. Now, this may have some advantages, but it doesn't allow you to see the front end of your car, nor the back end of the car right in front of you. Also, the front window does not allow you to see the cars right net to you with any sort of ease. I've been in many minivans and I can say that when it comes to comfort, nothing can really top the Transport. It truly does have many of the luxuries that you would want in a van. Yet, I do not recommend buying this vehicle. <br><br>
