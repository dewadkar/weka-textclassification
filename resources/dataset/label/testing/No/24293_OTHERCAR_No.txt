            We purchased a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee at 39k miles, and sold it at 110k miles.  The SUV looks very nice,  with pretty lines and high ground clearance. Over the 3 years of ownership we had the following problems.

-  Brake rotor recall
-  Shift interlock recall
-  leaking oil seals
-  leaking power steering fluid,  noisy pump motor
-  AC recharge
-  failed power windows, and door locks
-  radiator repair.

For a vehicle that was never abused,  never taken off road,  and always had its oil changes at 3500 miles we were not happy with all of its problems.  It seems to me that Jeep loves to sell new SUV's  for $30-40k,  and then continues to collect from you at the repair shop.

If you are going to buy a SUV, my advice is to stick with the Toyota, Nissan, Honda, or Lexus SUV's.

If you select a Jeep, you better have a mechanic as your next door neighbor.<br><br>
