            I bought this vehicle because it had a good economical price.  I had this car almost a year and it's been in the shop.IT is a 97 sunfire.  This is a good vehicle to use if your just a college kid or a teenager. Please dont waste your time or money on this excuse for a car.  It is not worth the money and I will never suggest buying one for pleasure.  I'd rather be driving a tank or riding a bicycle because when my pregnant wife broke down the third time in this junky car thats when i really decided that i did not like this car.  It does get excellent gas mileage and it drives ok but the mechanical problems are a little bit too much for my taste.<br><br>
