            I bought my 1998 4-door 4x4 Blazer in September 2000. My soon-to-be husband wanted me out of my sporty car and into something "safer". It was quite an adjustment but I soon fell in love with it. I don't think I can ever go back to a car. The Blazer is comfortable, easy to drive and extremely useful. The rear seats fold down to haul larger items. My husband, 6'2" fits comfortably in the front seats and the four doors are great for passengers. 
For everyday driving it is the perfect size. Although, with four adults on a four-hour trip, it was starting to seem smaller by the mile. 

Two months after purchase, the problems started. Intermittent electrical problems that would never happen when it was at the dealership. It spent four week-long stays at the dealership but still was not fixed when the warranty expired. Mostly when it's raining or cold, the door locks, headlights and electric windows quit working. The odometer resets itself, speedometer moves back and forth and the "idiot" lights start blinking. The back windshield wiper works half the time, the back door lock doesn't work at all from the outside and the heater works some of the time on most of the settings. The spring on the hood release broke and the drivers side recline handle just snapped off in my hand. So now I have a "brand-new to me" vehicle, making high payments and am afraid to put down the window in fear that it won't go back up. 

Despite the problems, I love my Blazer. It drives nice and handles well. My husband (the mechanic and ex-Chevy lover before this) is now trying to get me to trade it in on a Ford. Apparently, you have to lift the motor to change the last spark plug. Also, I cracked the (plastic) front grill (which holds in the headlight bucket) and you have to order a new one from the dealership because we were told they put twelve different grills on that model year. They moved the clips so you can't use one from a junkyard. Thanks Chevy! So much for "company profits" vs. recycling. 

My Blazer has never left me stranded and on its good days, I cannot find anything to compare to it for the price. I would like to try another Blazer and hope mine was a fluke, but I don't think my mechanic is going to let that happen. Who can blame him? If I wanted to gamble, I'd go back to Vegas. For now, it's back to epinions to find my next vehicle...
