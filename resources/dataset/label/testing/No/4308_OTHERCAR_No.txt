            From the first time I saw the new Beetle, I wanted one, but I live by the old rule, never buy software or cars the first year they come out. So I waited and bought a new 2000 Beetle in September of 1999. I was so happy! But as with all good things, they soon pass. 3 months after I bought my 'dream' car, the transmission started slipping. After days of fighting with the service station, I was able to bring down my car in a week and a half to have them just look at it. Apparently, 'service' with Volkswagen only holds up until the check clears. After keeping my BRAND NEW CAR for 2 weeks, I finally got it back. They replaced the transmission. For all of the pain and suffering I and my car went through, all I requested from VW was and extended warranty, and I was told by the Corporate Office of VW that they had reviewed my 'case' and they could not do anything for me. I went 4 levels up the food chain at VW's copr. offices, and got the same BS story. What a waste of time, and energy. 
As if that was not bad enough, should I mention the 6, yes count em' 6 times they 'fixed' my trunk so that it would open. I suppose by now, you can guess that... yes my trunk still does not open all the time. 
If I had a chance to go back in time, I wouldn't buy another VW if my damn life depended on it. The Car is Garbage, the Service Sucks, and the People the Run the company are Incompetent. As someone who pretty much set fire to almost $21,000, do yourself a favor.... DON'T DO IT..... YOU WILL BE SORRY! <br><br>
