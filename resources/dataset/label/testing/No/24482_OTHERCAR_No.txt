            We bought our '94 Concorde used in '98 with 88,000 miles on it.  Owned by a little old lady (etc, etc, etc).  :)  At first it was a love-affair.  The leather seats, power everything, great performance, and incredible comfort were all combined to make us think we had a wonderful machine.  We made many extended trips (1800+ miles) to southern Florida to visit my son and found the comfort to be very pleasant indeed.  Plenty of leg room, good visibility and excellent trunk space.  

Since moving out west, we have continued our extended trips averaging 700+, again enjoying the comfort of the vehicle over the long haul.  It would occasionally feel "wishy-washy" in bad snow conditions, but the front wheel drive helped.  By this time, we had 12 month old twins with their car seats in the rear, as well as enough space for my older son to sit comfortably between them and still have enough trunk space for all our junk for a week.

The instruments were easy to read and fairly well placed, the overhead computer was a real benefit to estimate gas mileage, distance to empty and to let the wife know what direction we were traveling.

The downsides to this vehicle were transmission problems that resulted in an entire replacement to the tune of $2000.  We found out at that time that Chrysler had a continuing problem with that model tranny and similar problems had been seen in the Intrepid family as well.  Our water pump also failed, but we didn't end up with an engine replacement (as others noted).  Repair was $300.  We also had a crack in the exhaust manifold repaired ($500), and a new radiator put in when some idiot broke the flush valve costing another $300.  The A/C system had a "stuck vent door" underneath the dash somewhere and we were quoted $700 to repair it.  I purchased a Clymer manual for the vehicle (STRONGLY recommend owning one for every vehicle you have - it can save a lot of grief over time, available at all parts stores) and ran the diagnostic routine for the A/C system which consisted of holding down three buttons, then translating what the numeric codes displayed on the A/C panel meant.  That solved the problem for the time being, but whenever we'd switch from heat to cold, it'd stick and we'd have to repeat the process.  At about the 100,000 mile mark, the inside hinge on the driver's seat broke and left it leaning to the inside of the vehicle.  Apparently, this was also a common failing in the vehicle, because there was a recall out for that very thing.  After many miles of use (dead at 140,000), the interior was starting to get pretty hammered.  Power windows screeching as they raised/lowered, cruise control cutting in and out, broken motor mounts, broken lid on the center arm rest console, power door locks not working and a few other minor details.  

It has been driven hard, but serviced regularly and served the family well.  The vehicle finally died when I hit an elk crossing the freeway.  The vehicle took the hit on the passenger side, and I believe that had the car not been shaped as "wedge-like" as it is, I would have had much, much worse damage.  Following the accident, the vehicle was still drivable (albeit stinky and cold, since the windshield was largely gone) and survived another 6 hours on the road getting home before being totaled by the insurance company.

I would choose not to own one again due mainly to finding out that it had a bad reputation from other owners and a poor reliability/mechanical history from the consumer reports.
