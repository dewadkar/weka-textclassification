            I purchased my Mercury Villager new in 1995.  It has approx 67K miles
on it.  Recently the transmission started to act up -- shifting at
different rpm points.  So I took it to the dealer I always do and 
was told that the transmission needed to be 'replaced'.  Not repaired,
not rebuilt, but replaced.  And that a new transmission cost $3600 -
with another $800 in labor.  For a total of at least $4400.  I called
the Ford customer hotline and got nowhere.  The dealer refuses to give
me the number of the local Ford representative, so I have a vehicle
with bad transmission and looking at a $4400 bill to get back on the
road.  With most cars, you would be able to rebuild the transmission or
get a rebuilt one to put in for one third this cost; but with the Villager this is not an option.  This is just something to consider
before you buy.
