            I purchased my blazer new from the local dealer in 1995.  It performed flawlessly for the first year, and then was in the dealer's shop multiple times for transmision and rear end leaks.  The tranny was replaced under warranty after it failed.  The 4.3 liter v-6 has enough torque in most situations althought there have been times when I wish I had more engine.
On the inside the dash and related items seem a bit plasticy and tend to sqeak and rattle on rough roads.  The power leather seats are less than impressive, and become uncomfortable after a few hours on the road.  For reasons i can't explain the 8-track in my plymouth sounds better than the stereo in the blazer.  It needs serious help.  The transfer case and suspension have yet to complain and are both well-suited for on or off road driving.  If i was able to do it again, i'd buy a newer model with fewer flaws and a remodeled interior.  <br><br>
