                   <b>S</b>ince the Camaro's introduction in 1967, the Camaro Z28 has been an 'all-American' tire frying, V8 powered coupe. During the energy crises in the late 70s-1980s however 4-cylinders, V6s, and underpowered V8s were used in base models. Between 1982 and 1984 the Camaro hit its all time low with its base model coming standard with a Iron Duke 2.5 liter 90 horsepower 4-cylinder, this matched with an automatic in a car that weighed a tad over 3,000 lbs, sounds fun huh?

       <b>F</b>or 1993, a fourth generation Camaro was introduced. This car's design was way ahead of its time, and in V8 form, for the first time took out the Mustang 5.0s in straight line performance. This review, although is on the V6 powered base Camaro, so please, <b>DO NOT</b> in anyway associate this review with the stunningly fast 1993 V8 models.

   <b>I</b>n 1993 the base Camaro came with a 3.4 liter OHV V6 producing 160 horsepower. During this time GM was putting their 200hp DOHC version 3.4 in cars like the Grand prix SE, Chevy Lumina Z34s, and the Monte Carlos. But I guess the Camaro (which is supposed to be 2nd to Chevy's flagship Corvette) only got the OHV relatively anemic 3.4. Anything GM could do to keep the base models price down was done. 


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>


The 1993 Chevrolet Camaro drives like a boat, even in the 1993 Z28 handling is not all that great, but at least in the Z28 you have 275hp to 'up' the fun factor. Here with the base model, you have poor handling matched with a 3.4 liter engine that should have been used in a Buick Century, or better yet, not used at all.  The 1993 Camaro I drove also come with an automatic transmission, which unlike the 6-speed that helps the Z28 scoot to 60 in 5.9 seconds (according to specs), slowed me down to an estimated 0-60 in the 10 second range (also according to specs). In otherwords, if you are at a stop light, beware of any minivans that want to race (ha).  The 3.4 Camaro can also be had with a 5-speed manual which I recommend getting if you decide the Z28 is too much car. Handling is probably this car's worst attribute however, unlike the Z28, the base Camaro seems to lean far too much in corners, the stock tires also do not help here. One might also note that under full throttle there is no sporty sound to the exhaust, instead it sounds like your average Chevy Beretta. This could be good or bad depending on what you like to hear when you floor your car's gas pedal.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>  
      
The <b>Interior</b> of the base Camaro can be had with plenty of amenities, and ergonomics are good. There is a thick leather wrapped steering wheel, a decent 4 speaker stock sound system, and a surprisingly cold AC. The auto shifter looks nice (does it sound like i'm scraping the bottom of the pork barrel for compliments on the base Camaros interior? I think so). Anyway, the interior is above average (despite all the plastic) for this year in an American car for the MSRP, I liked it much better than the <a href="/content_70428364420"> 1993 Mustang's</a>. Other than the fact that the 1993 Mustang has more room, the Mustang is also more comfortable, and has more cargo space. The Mustang also boasts better materials, the plastics in the base Camaro seem as if GM stole some of the plastics off the old Dodge Aeries K cars.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

    The <b>exterior</b> of the 1993 Camaro is totally 'all American'. There is no confusing the 1993 Camaro's design with a Maserati, or Venturi. The 1993 Camaro comes with composite  body panels, cool rear lights, optional alloy rims, and a very aggressive modern look. One might also note the overall mass of this car. Instead of looking like your typical sports car, the Camaro looks very large. Chevy would have made this car much more appealing if they could use this good look in a smaller package without sacrificing interior room.


<i>Conclusion/Pricing:</i> 

The base Camaro was, and is an amazing value, it being as slow as a minivan or not. This car has a sharp design, it is reliable, gets good gas mileage, and has a modern interior. A used 1993 V6 Camaro Can be found for around 5,000-7,000 dollars.
