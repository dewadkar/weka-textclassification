            I bought this vehicle because the salesman assured me of the great quality of the product and how Hyundai takes pride in customer service and maintaining a quality product.  After all Hyundai is supposed to have America's best warranty.
I wish I could agree.  I have had my Elantra for one year and it has been in the shop three times and ready for its forth visit.  The first problem was with the airbags.  There was a mechanical problem and when I took it in the shop they didn't have the parts to repair it.  The service department warned me, &quot;don't get in a wreck the airbags won't deploy and you might die.&quot;  I failed to see the humor in his statement.  
I had to have the windshield replaced within the first three months of having the vehicle.
The next ordeal occurred while I was interning in Minneapolis.  The car began stalling and quitting when I came to a stop in traffic or simply parking the car.  It took forever to find a dealership to work on my car.  I made several calls to Hyundai for the closest dealership and I was told to go to Iowa.  When I did finally find a dealer I had to leave the car there all day so I needed transportation to work.  Upon purchasing my Elantra I was told the warranty would cover a rental car.  It didn't.  I was out $80 for a rental and no I did not get a luxury vehicle.  And I still ended up missing hours at work.
Now here we are in December 2000 and I have had my Elantra for one year.  I have almost been hit twice because it stalled while entering traffic.  I press the gas pedal but the car doesn't go anywhere.  I have been trying to get it worked on but the dealer doesn't work on Saturday so I am expected to miss work and pay for another rental.  Which if you have had to rent a car this is a time consuming process in itself.  
I wouldn't recommend this vehicle.  I bought it for the great warranty and service and it has only failed me.
