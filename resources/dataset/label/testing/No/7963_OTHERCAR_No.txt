            There is such a small niche market here that you are limited to choices...full size sport utility convertibles are just not that popular...you have the Isuzu Amigo or the Jeep Wranger.  I chose the Jeep Wrangler.

One must expect that this type of vehicle has major differences that would say a passenger car.  For almost 5 years I have driven several German made automobiles before deciding to make the switch to a sport ute and an American made car.

The good:

*  Versatility for good weather or bad weather.
*  Easy to park.
*  Gas mileage is pretty good.

The bad:

*  NOISY on the interior.
*  BUMPY and ROUGH drive at best.
*  Poor workmanship which always leaves you wondering when is this going     to break down on the side of the road.
*  The top is an excercise in geometry and physics to remove and replace.
*  The engine is in much need of power boosting.
*  Overall feeling of poor workmanship.

The questionable:

*  There is only the bare necessities of instrumentation.
*  How safe is this vehicle in an accident?

Maybe its me or maybe its the car I used to but I can't say that I love my  Wrangler.  It is noisy, handles rough, the steering is too tight, the body frame squeeks, and I always feel like I'm biding my time before it just won't start.

I should have stuck with German engineering.
