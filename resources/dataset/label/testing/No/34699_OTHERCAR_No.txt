                   Recently ran into the salesman that sold me this car three years ago. He said it was one of the cars he would never forget. He had about seven thousand dollars in it, mostly because of repairs. I have put about $6000. into repairs. Nearly everything except the waterpump has been replaced at least once, some parts several times. I've been stalled all over the state. A couple of years ago we decided not to take it out of our small city, its more expensive to get repairs away from home. I have four different garages that we take it to. It's embarrasing to admit how much money we've spent trying to keep it rolling. The current problem of only starting one or two days a week has stumped all four garages. It doesn't have any spark 5 or 6 days per week. We have replaced the distributer, rotor, ignition module, and crank case sensor, still no spark (it has a new alternator and battery). The Dodge dealer is stumped and cannot fix it. 
       I've picked out a car to trade it in on, that is at a dealership about 8 blocks from my home. I try to start it a couple times per day, the next time it starts I'm going to drive straight to the dealer and trade it. Clic and Clac from the NPR series &quot;Car Talk&quot; (11AM Saturdays) called it the worst car of the Millenium.<br><br>
