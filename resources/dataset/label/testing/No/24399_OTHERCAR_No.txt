              My mother fell in live with a 1995 Mercury Tracer Trio, at her first test drive.  We have had this car for about five months and it had about 45,000 miles at beginning, and one owner.  But a few weeks later for no reason her air conditioner went.  Few weeks later a really strong anti-freeze smell started.  To find out it had a leak.  We mended it, but it never went away.  Smell stayed in the car along with a greasy film on all windows.  Then just the other day the heat gauge started to move back and forth with no stopping.  And on the way back from work as I was turning the car died.  This car was bought used at around $6000, and has about 60,000 miles.  A car should not have failed so quickly.  Cars in my house-holds are decade old and all have over 100,000 miles and since the day we have bought them used they have had much less problems then this newer car.  For the money we paid for this car has let us down, and may stick with foreign cars from now on. 
  Then there is the constant noises through out the car.  Pieces that should last for a long time have fallen off.  There was at the time we bought it a extra piece causing pain on the driver's side that was removed.
