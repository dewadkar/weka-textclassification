This is one car I would love to have, as long as I had another one that I could actually use.

The car is (I've been told) as practical as a pit bull terrier at a maternity ward.

Currently I drive a BMW 325i. Its powerful, great to drive, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect car, but it's missing just one thing. It only looks like a car. I want a shark on wheels. Now that is where the Lamby C comes in. Its just perfect(well expect that reversing the car is a bit of a challenge). A work of art that purrs.

The only thing Im not sure about is what colour to have it. Well I suppose keeping in nature of the beast ( a Great white shark) there is really one colour that brings out its shape to the full.

If there is anyone interested in a 325i with all the extras for a Lamb C (and a push bike) please email me.
