<TEXT>
            After searching for a new car in January 1999, my wife and I decided to buy a 1999 Saab 9-5, which has proven to be a terrible decision.  We feel like we have purchased a lemon.  During the past year, we have had the following problems:
1) Replacement of three (3) tires (all at our expense because there was allegedly no defect);
2) Fuel injection problems in which the car revs on its own when it is started;
3) Clock/radio display partially blacks out at random times;
4) Battery died on 12/24/1999!
5) Automatic trunk unlocking system failed several times, even after attempted repair was made; and
6) we have been driving a loaner (rental car) for the past 8 days because the Saab manufacturer had to ship the dealer a major part so that they can try to fix the various fuel injection problems.

All in all, we are going to get rid of this car as soon as possible, and we will NEVER buy another Saab.  I had heard people talk about Saab owners having lots of problems, and unfortunately, now we understand.
