            The Sonoma I bought has the standard cab. One problem that appeared immediately after driving off the lot was the radio quit. Returning to the dealer left me with a hole in the dash. Dealer had removed radio to send for repair. Six weeks and several phone calls to General Motors headquarters in Detroit finally yielded a new replacement radio. Lack of corporate concern in that the dealers cannot replace a defective radio needs attention. 
The truck itself has a 4 cylinder engine. OK if you don't get into a tight traffic situation. Step down on the gas and wait. Not much extra power to get you out of a tight situation. 
Brake pedal needs to be more in line horizontally with the gas pedal. Present setup requires one to lift their right leg higher in order to get the foot on the pedal. 
Seats are most uncomfortable. My wife and I have to use pillows and back supports if you are going to be in the vehicle for more than 20 minutes. 
Gas mileage is good. About 20 mpg when using the AC. About 25 mpg during cool weather when the AC is not needed. 
Truck otherwise is good and reliable. Starts right off even in cold weather (no problems to date). Jack takes a bit of getting used to on first use. 
Nice big outside mirrors are a real asset but it would help if they could be set inside the cab rather than the old way of having someone align the right side while driver is in the seat. 
Headlights on all the time and will switch to night format without manually switching. This is real nice. Another nice touch is after turning off the ignition and removing the key the radio stays on until driver opens the door. This is real nice. 
GMAC financing option was real nice. Option to return after 36 months is really appreciated. 
GM needs to look at their radio replacement problem, adjust brake pedal to be more in line with accelerator, and use seats that are much more comfortable. Don't know if they can make a more peppy 4-cylinder. Oh yes, when you step down on the gas the engine speeds up before transmission engages. Takes a bit of getting used to. <br><br>
