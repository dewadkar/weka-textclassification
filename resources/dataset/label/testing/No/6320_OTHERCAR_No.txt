            When I first laid eyes on this beauty I was love struck. The car has an incredible body layout. A tough grill that makes the car look as if it's growling at you. I got the standard edition so it didn't have the sun-roof or the spoiler or alloy wheels, but she was still pretty. My feelings of euphoria were short lived. Not one month after purchasing it, the brakes began to wear, and I noticed the car began to rattle a lot more. Thinking it was merely regular wear and tear on the brakes I had them replaced and went on my way. The next thing that I noticed was the transmission beginning to slip. Not much at first, but as the weeks went on, the slipping became more frequent, and my brakes began to squeek again. This is no longer than a month after i had them replaced. I brought the car back to the dealer asking them to take a look at the trans and see if my brakes were wearing down again. I was told that my trans is about done for and that I needed a new one and that my brakes needed to be replaced also. So far, within a month, my car need its brakes changed twice and a new transmission. Not only this, but I could no longer stand the constant jarring of my body and rattling of the car. Within the year that I owned it I had to replace the brakes 3 times, replace the trans 2 times, and put up with nothing but terrible service at the Dodge repair shop. This car has a very deceiving look to it, I am reminded of the saying "Don't judge a book by it's cover." Perhaps the grill isn't a growl, but more of a sneer, as it laughs at you for buying it.
