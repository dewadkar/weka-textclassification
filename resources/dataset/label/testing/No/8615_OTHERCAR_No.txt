            After hearing all of the great comments about the Odyssey, I went to my dealers to give it a thorough going over.  While I found a lot of positives, I came away much less impressed than I expected to be.

On the positive side, I loved the internal design.  This was put together with the needs of the customer in mind.  The space and flexibility was wonderful.

The engine is also first rate.  Plenty of power, smooth, and provides good acceleration at highway speeds.  Although it was a wee bit sluggish at low speed.  Handling is also very good, much better than many of the expensive, sportier-looking SUVs.

The safety crash test reports are also excellent.  And the resale value is phenomenal, I've seen 2 year Odysseys selling for over 90% of their original price.  No domestic minivan even comes close on this score.

Styling is always in the eye of the beholder, but I find the Odyssey to be very plain in appearance.  I've heard it described as a refridgerator on wheels but I wouldn't go that far.  It is hard to make a minivan look good, but even in this drab category, the Odyssey is in the middle of the pack.

The down side of the slate was longer than I had anticipated.

My #1 complaint is the noise at interstate speeds.  A droning kinda noise comes from the rear and is quite audible at 65-75mph.  (Should note that the Odyssey is quiet at lower speeds.)  I have an ear condition that is aggravated by certain types of noise and after just a few minutes in the Odyssey, my ears were giving me fits.  Later I spent some time researching owner's opinions on several of the car review sites and found that a lot of people were complaining about the noise.

#2 is the poor seats in the LX model.  My wife is only 5'2" and the view through the front windsheld was obstructed even at the highest seat setting.  Also, after about 15 minutes I was already experiencing some lower-back twinges - scary to imagine how bad it would be on a long trip.  The EX seats were much better, but having to pay an extra $3000 to get reasonable good seats is a bit much.

A lesser irritant was: Access to the spare tire is cumbersome.

Another key factor to consider is that while many people are under the impression that the new Odyssey has a stellar reliability record, this actually is not true.  The Odyssey is based on the Accord platform and the Accord's record is superb.  And the older Odyssey, the smaller one that was also sold by Isuzu, had the best reliability record of any minivan ever built.  However the new, larger Odyssey has already been downgraded on its 1999 models by Consumer Reports and Motor Trend to only "average".  They have found increasing problems on the 2 year old Odysseys.  And there are already reports suggesting the same may be true for the 2000 model.

So when it came time to make a buy decision, after beginning with the almost sure impression that I would purchase an Odyssey, it didn't even make my final cut of my top 3 choices.  As one of my primary criteria was long-trip comfort, the thought of driving hundreds of miles in an uncomfortable seat with high levels of road noise struck horror in my mind.

I still consider the Odyssey to be a superior product in some ways.  And I understand they have recently improved the seats in the LX models.  

One last note, I've read other reviews that suggested the long waits to obtain the Odyssey is a sign of their superiority.  This claim is dubious.  Honda makes less than 20% as many Odysseys as Chrysler makes their various versions of their minivan.  Thus it is not at all surprising to find Chrysler vans in stock and at discounted prices at dealerships while you have to wait for a Honda.  It would be interesting to see what would happen to Honda pricing if they made 5 times as many vans.
