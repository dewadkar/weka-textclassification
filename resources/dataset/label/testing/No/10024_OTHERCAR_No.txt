            Coming from someone who is in the car business and deals with resale value everyday I can tell you that we can not even get the wholesalers to look at these.  When a customer drives on our lot in one of these we run.  They have so much negative equity that we can't help them.  The car is cheap I do have to tell you that.  Their are plenty of other makes and models out there that are a much better deal.  I won't mention mine just to prove my point.  Take a look at consumer books like Intellichoice and J.D. Powers.  Just remember a car is only worth what some one will pay for it.<br><br>
