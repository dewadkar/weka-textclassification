            I have always been the kind of person who appreciates a nice-looking car.  For years, my husband and I owned a Nissan Maxima and thought we would never buy anything else.  Then when we decided to start a family we reasoned that a car would no longer be practical.  Determined never to drive a mini-van, we started looking at Sport Utility Vehicle's.  They were, and still are, the trendy choice for families.

So, Sport Utility shopping we went.  My parents had previously owned a Toyota Four Runner that I thought looked sharp, but it didn't seem to ride very smoothly.  I took one ride in the back of a friend's Lincoln Navigator and vowed never to buy one because it was a gigantic pain to get in and out of, (not to mention the price tag).  That's when I came across the Honda Passport.  It caught my eye right away, and frankly, I usually don't take a second glance if it doesn't look sharp.

It appeared to have everything that I was searching for.  I wanted a bit more room than a car, but not so much that it felt like driving a bus.  The EX model came with all the luxuries: leather seats, 6-disc CD changer/cassette stereo, power sunroof, power window, power locks, keyless entry, etc.  I brought my husband to look it over and we bought it 3 days later.

By this time I was 3 months pregnant and nauseous morning, noon and night.  What I needed was a smooth ride.  Instead I felt as if I were driving a buggy.  It was very bouncy and you could feel every bump in the road.  I was constantly telling my husband to slow down, but I soon realized that it didn't matter who was driving, it was just SO BOUNCY! It didn't help to lay my seat back either.  The headrests were the most uncomfortable I've ever used.

When we had our Maxima we never had to take it to the shop.  But after just a month of driving our Honda Passport, the Check Engine light came on.  Worried, I quickly brought it to the dealer.  Wouldn't you know it, when I got within 10 miles of the dealership the light went off!  Well, of course they couldn't fix a problem that they couldn't see, so they sent me home.  The next day I'm buzzing along, thinking it must have been some kind of fluke, and HELLO- there's the light again!  I calmly take it back to the dealer, and while the technician is taking it for a test drive, GOOD-BYE, the light disappears again.  Now, I could go on and on here, but let me save you the agony.  I had to take it back 3 more times!!!  They couldn't figure out what the problem was, but guessed it might be the gas cap.  So, they order me a new one, install it and ...the light is STILL on today!  Finally, they suggested that if the car seems to be running all right, just ignore the light.  Well, I've learned to live with my little friend, the Check Engine Light, but every time someone gets in my car they point it out as if the engine is going to burst into flames.

Can you believe that while I was having all of that trouble, my CD changer went haywire.  I had my buddies at the dealership look at it on one of my other visits, and they informed me that it would be pricey to fix.  It would have to be sent in to Honda CD, cassette, radio and all.  I ended up taking it to a local fix-it shop where they kept it for 2 weeks only to tell me that it would have to be sent in to Honda.  All of this time I'm driving around in silence.  We ended up trashing that system and bought a whole new one with a three year warranty.

Can I say anything good about this vehicle?  Yes, I always get compliments on how nice it looks and it has never broken down on me.  The tailgate opens nice and wide, making it easy to get my monster stroller in and out.  The 4-Wheel Drive works very well, and all from the touch of a button.

I would not recommend this Sport Utility Vehicle or any one for a couple with children still in car seats.  It leaves little room for more than one adult back there.  It is also high enough to make it difficult to put your child in their car seat.  I feel like I'm practically throwing my daughter in.

I would recommend the Honda Passport to a young couple or a single person who are not concerned with comfort.

As for my husband and I, remember the ones determined to never drive a mini-van?  Our Passport is up for sale and we are buying a mini-van ASAP!
