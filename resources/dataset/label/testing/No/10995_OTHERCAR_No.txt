            Two years ago my wife and children were hit from behind by a semi-truck who's driver wasn�t paying attention. Through luck and children�s safety seats nobody was hurt, our 95 Nissan Sentra was completely totaled though. I decided we needed to upgrade to a safer more obvious vehicle and we went ahead and bought a 97 Astrovan.

I've got to tell you there is good, bad and ugly on this van.

The good.
I think it�s great that its on a truck frame and not a cars, this makes it a bit wider and more stable for its height than other vans we test drove. As for interior comfort we couldn�t have asked for better. From it's two easily removable bench seats to the upper counsel that tells you outside temperature and direction your going it provides a very comfortable driving experience, especially on long trips. I'm 6'3 240lbs and finding comfortable legroom isn�t always easy for me. The Chevy Astrovan provided it with room to spare. This van has seemed very mechanically sound. No engine troubles, no troubles with the 4-wheel drive unit, transmition is smooth and it has power to spare.

The bad.
After a year of owning this van and lauding it to everyone, things started going wrong. Little things that you don�t really throw fits about. The air-conditioner would go on and off, the knob to the side mirror adjusters broke off in my hand. The rod inside of the passenger door became bent so the door had to be opened from the inside. The windshield wiper fluid dispenser stopped working. The motor for the automatic window on the driver's side burned out. The gas gage indicator broke so we have to manually figure the amount of gas left. (It's left us stranded and out of gas twice when we messed up.) Not huge things by themselves but when added up they become quite a pain in the behind!

The ugly.
Gas-guzzler. This van gets horrible mileage, even immediately after a tune up. Ours is the all wheel drive model but still its ridiculous. We also noticed that a mildew smell was coming about and than found a leak from the top of the van, (I live in Beaverton, OR and leaks aren�t something to scoff at here!) When we took it in we found that this was a common occurance with these vehicles.

I hate to be this picky and I know there are far worse vehicles out there, but this van has nickel and dimed us to death. I hope it's just our vehicle and not an indicator of the average but I have to say I can't recommend it to anyone else just because for what you pay you should get a better put together vehicle.
Good luck!
