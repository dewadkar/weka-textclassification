            We bought our Chrysler Plymouth Voyager Rallye minivan in June 1996.  We have twins and often have visitors and thought that a minivan would solve our auto space problems.  Once we dealt with some initial dealer screw-ups the Voyager was great, roomy, powerful, fantastic sound system, etc.

By December 1997 we began having our first problems with the Voyager.  The minivan�s electrical system would not work when we tried to start it.  Sometimes the dome lights would come on and sometimes not.  We brought the minivan to the closest Chrysler service center and they told us that the battery was defective and replaced it.  

The problem, however, continued: Intermittently the electrical system does not operate and we must have the minivan jumped or towed.  The service center has tried to fix the problem 8 times.  Twice they kept the minivan for 3 or 4 days to try to replicate, identify, and resolve the problem -- without success.  Chrysler paid for rental cars for us on both occasions.  Still, the problem continues and is getting more frequent with time and Chrysler now refuses to pay for a rental even though this problem started while under warranty.

The Chrysler technicians have concluded that �something� is drawing down the battery�s power, but can�t pinpoint the source.  Their best guess is that one of the minivan�s hundreds of relay switches is sticking open after the ignition is turned off.  One technician confided that finding the problematic relay switch would be like finding a needle in a haystack.  

While we have brought the minivan in to be fixed 8 times, the electrical system has died many more times than this.  On these occasions we have usually jumped the minivan because we have been in a hurry to get the kids to school, or get to some other appointment.  The problem goes away for a few days or weeks and then recurs.  For instance, in March 2000 we had to jump it 5 times and then we brought it to the Chrysler service center.  

After having brought the minivan in 3 weeks ago and having the battery replaced yet again, in the past week it has died five times.  We are now to the point of having to coordinate our morning schedules around starting the minivan in case it needs to be jumped.  

We (and apparently many other Epinion reviewers) have got a lemon. It is great that there is now a venue to inform other unwitting consumers about Chrysler products.  Too bad there wasn't anything like this website when we were shopping for a minivan in '96.  Fortunately, we have a 1991 Mazda 626 that continues to run smoothly without any major problems.<br><br>
