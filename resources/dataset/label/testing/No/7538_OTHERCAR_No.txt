                 The 2001 Mitsubishi Diamante is a luxury car running at around the $25,000 price range.  It has it's good points and it's bad points, however in my opinion the bad points outweigh the good ones.

     I had a good chance of evaluating this car the other day when I went to the dealership and took the car out for a nice long test drive.  When I was going down the road I didn't really feel like I was riding on $25,000, it definitely felt like a little less then that.


<b><i>Power and Handling</i></b>

     One of the main problems that this car has is it's lack of power.  The car comes with a V6, 3.5 liter engine that does not do the car justice.  It's 0-60 speed which is 8.3 seconds is not that impressive.  This car's handling is OK compared to other automobiles of this size.  It takes turns pretty well and is easy to steer.


<b><i>Transmission</i></b>  

     This car has an electronically controlled four-speed automatic.  It does not shift as well as other transmissions.  This will have an effect on the car's performance and probably renders it's overall power.


<b><i>Looks</i></b>

     The outside of this car was given a BMW-like appearance and window moldings, grille trim and license plate surroundings in chrome are emphasized.  The inside of this car is presentable but still nothing more then average.  It looks ok, but I think the people that put this car together could have possibly used better materials such as real wood.

<b><i>Comfort and Features</i></b>

     In my opinion the seats in this car are uncomfortable.  They just didn't fit the contours of my body.  However, the car is pretty roomy.  This car's sound system is very good for a stock system and the LS features a CD player and even comes with an amplifier.  This car also features options such as an anti-theft immobilizer, leather seats, sunroof, and heated seats.


<b>Overall</b>

    Out of 5 stars, I'll probably give it a 2.5 stars and round it up to a 3 stars.  It comes through in looks, roominess and a great sound system but it lacks a lot of the good points that it's competitors feature.  You could get more for your money.<br><br>
