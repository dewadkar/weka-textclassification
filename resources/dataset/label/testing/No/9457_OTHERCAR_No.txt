            We leased this in '97 because my wife wanted a good looking 4x4 truck.  It impressed me as spacious for a regular cab truck, powerful, and rode reasonably well compared to my previous old design trucks.  

The interior space and comfortable seating position continued to impress, but the truck has had several problems.  The &quot;upgraded stereo&quot; CD player went out within a year.  It was replaced under warranty. It also was having shift problems.  A few months later, the CD went out again.  It also had more transmission problems and required a new overdrive unit.  A few months after that, the transmission was leaking again. The brakes have lost effectiveness for some mysterious reason, even though 3 seperate shops (dealer and independent) have said they check out fine.  More than once I have put the pedal to the floor and the vehicle has required very long stopping distances. It will not even lock up the front wheels, even without 4 wheel ABS.   While it has never left us stranded, it gives you the impression that it is about to.   It coughs, wheezes, creaks, groans, and just generally does not inspire confidence.  The paint, even though waxed faithfully, is already dull and looks older than it is.  

UPDATE:  9/00   Though I've since turned in my Ram, my brother has a '98 4x4 model and recently approached me to ask about my brake problems. Seems he too has experienced a spongy brake pedal and lack of braking power.   It may be a malfunctioning master brake cylinder.  Not a good problem to have with a 5,000 lb vehicle.
I LOVE the look and comfort in the cab, as well as the space.   I HATE the slightly &quot;out of control&quot; feeling you get when driving it.  You simply aren't confident that you can avoid an accident if something unexpected occurred.  Basically, it's a truck, and drives like one.  Unfortunately, it drives like a mid-80's design.  

I also love the high resale value.  It made my lease rather affordable. ($350/month for 39 months, nothing down, for a loaded $25,500 4x4 truck)

With rebates and discounts, as well as improvements over the years to the interior, braking, steering, and handling, the Ram is competitive, and a good value.  Just be prepared for some frustrations and a very non-carlike ride. Someone who wants to project a macho image and save a little money over a comparable Ford or GM product might want to try the Ram.  But basically, unless you use this vehicle for towing or hauling (which I did until the transmission problems, at which point I turned it over to my wife), you are better served by any of the other makes, all of which are more refined and suitable for light duty use.  You should NOT buy this vehicle if you live in a state where gasoline is expensive.  Our 5.9L got 13.5 mpg overall, and much less when towing.   You should also consider another brand if you like keeping vehicles for 10 years.  I can't imagine a Ram lasting that long without a new transmission and brake overhaul along the way.   <br><br>
