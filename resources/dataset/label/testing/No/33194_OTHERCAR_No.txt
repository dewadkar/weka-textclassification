            I can't believe I have to write this article, but I read the reviews of others who praised this car and I need to offer a contrary opinion for potential buyers.  I have owned my '93 Concorde for 4 years and that's 4 years of stupidity.  The worst of the car is anything electrical.  First, the air conditioning.  Read all the recalls on this matter (up to 70,000 miles).  Last year the driver's power window fritzed, and the window ran off it's track ($500 fix).  Since then, let's see.... the horn intermittantly would go off whether the car was on or off, and would not shut off until I pulled the fuse.  This also disabled the power door locks.  He gave me two options, the $1000 one and the $50 one.  I took the latter, which fixed everything except the driver's door doesn't lock/unlock when all the others do.
Everything seems to wear fast on this car - rotors, brakes, exhaust.  Now it needs a tuneup (last one was 1 year ago).
Do yourself a favor - RUN away from this car.  Oh, by the way, I have one to sell, wanna buy it?<br><br>
