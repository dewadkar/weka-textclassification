            I leased an S-10 in 1999.  I have a 2wd, extra-cab (w/third door), automatic trans, and a weak 4cyl. engine.  Besides the fairly good deal I got on the lease, I think I made one of the biggest MISTAKES of my life.  I had a Toyota Tacoma before this and wish I could have it back!

Reasons To buy this truck:

1). looks good

Reason NOT to buy/lease this truck:

1).  Very shoddy manufacturing.  The plastic is always buzzing around.  Especially the plastic that's on the inside of the 3rd door.  It's actually coming of the door and is constantly making really annoying rattling sounds as I go down the road...it basically sounds as if it's coming apart.  

2).  The WEAKEST 4cyl. I have ever seen.  My Dad has a Nissan with a 4cyl and it's much stronger than this one.  I was barely able to pull an empty snow-mobile trailer that weighed about 200 lbs.  Don't think you're going to get good gas mileage with this 4 cyl either.  It has to work so hard to keep up that it burns gas like a V8.  

3).  Extremely slow.  There have been times where I had to accelerate quickly to get out of a situation on the road and I felt like I was going to get crushed by oncoming cars because of how slow it gets going.

4).  The 3rd door is a good idea, but the handle is made out of plastic.  It broke as I went to open it one time.  Now the 3rd door is useless!  Called my dealer to get it fixed and they say they have to check to see if it's covered.  

5).  The Toyota that I had seemed to be made far better.  I never had any rattles inside or anything breaking.  

At first I was proud that I went with an American truck.  However, I can honestly say that this is the LAST American auto/truck that I purchase or lease.  American cars still are not up to par with foreign cars (Japanese or European), and I doubt they ever will be.  

I tried complaining to my dealer and GM directly, to get out of the lease but I'm stuck.  I can't sell it because no one wants to buy a crappy American truck.
