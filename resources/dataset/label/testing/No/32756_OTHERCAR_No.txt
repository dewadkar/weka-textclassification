            I have owned a 1993 Camaro Z28 for about 5 years.  I have always wanted to own a Camaro as it was the first car my dad drove and I have always wanted a quick car.  When I bought the car it had about 55,000 miles on it and had 1 owner who was a middle age woman who took good care of the car.  It now has about 100,000 miles on it and I have done nothing but dump money in this car.

Since I have had this car I have replaced the fuel pump costing me over $700, I have replaced the compressor and almost all parts of the air conditioning costing me well over $1000 and now the alternator is going out.  I have had a rattle in the back end for over 2 years.  This thumping noise increases and decreases with your speed and is highly annoying.

The 1993 model was the first of this body style so this model does not include some nice options the 1994 model has like T-Tops, keyless entry, and a standard cd player with subwoofer which would make my 1993 a more enjoyable car.

This car is a nightmare to drive in any kind of poor weather or with any precipitation on the ground and my model is even the automatic.  Handling is not good and even gets worse with snow on the ground.  I have to put 80lb sandbags in the small trunk to just make it 2 miles to work in the winter.  The Z28 is real wheel driven and makes driving much more difficult in poor weather.  The other big drawback of the Z28 is its need for premium gas which has gotten very expensive in 2000.  I also want to mention that gas mileage is very poor on the Z28 and plan on doubling you annual fuel cost coming from a 6 cylinder to this 8 cylinder beast.

The only way I can suggest owning this car is if you live in a warm climate and have this car for fun and not your primary mode of transportation.  The Camaro over the year has proven not to be a very durable car and has a high upkeep cost.
