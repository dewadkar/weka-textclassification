            First of all, let me start off by saying that this is my sister's car, and not mine. Still, I have driven it on a frequent basis, and know the car intimately. With that said, let me tell you a little about the car. My sister bought the GT model with a sunroof, convenience package, heavy duty package, and a toyota security system (mostly for the remote keyless entry system). She decided to learn manual transmission, so as not to waste $800 on an automatic that steals this car of most of its zest. While this car is decidedly peppy,it is by no means a sports car. It has only adequate acceleration, and those seeking additional performance should look to the GTS, or even more preferably, an Honda Civic SI or Prelude, both of which handily outperform the celica (and the SI maxes out at $19,000). Also, this car is not all that economical - my sister only averages 26 mpg on mostly highway driving. Also, this car, like many sporty four cylinders, needs to be revved high to reach the powerband. It gets very tiring after a while to constantly listen to the engine whine at 6500 RPM. Other gripes include a back seat designed for small children and people you want to torture, poor visibility while backing up, pedals that are too close together and are easily pressed in conjunction, and seats that are too firm and grow uncomfortable too quickly. I can't recommend this car very highly, due to the existence of the Honda Civic Si, which outdoes the Celica GT and GTS in acceleration, handling, ergonomics, and has more room in back to boot. For the same price as a GTS, you could also get a Mitsubishi Eclipse with a V6 (though the reliability is troublesome) While it is a fun car, it is not the best for the price. And when you are spending over $20,000, do you want to settle for just adequate?<br><br>
