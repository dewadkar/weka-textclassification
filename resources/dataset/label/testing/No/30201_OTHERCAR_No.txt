            Honesty is the best policy. I will be frank and honest here.

The Dodge Caravan SE is a deathtrap. I know this because my family purchased one in 1992 and by 1995 it was costing us $100/month. Now, almost five years after that, it is costing about $200/month, and I am going to have to lease a new car for another $50/month if I want to feel safe during my morning commute. Among the many problems that the driver of a Dodge Caravan SE will have would be the constant recalls, the shotty workmanship used when the vehicle was created, and the second- teir construction of vital parts of this automobile: for example, it's engine.

1993: Clock on Cassette deck breaks- replacement: $300. I think not.

1994: Passenger side door begins to crack on inside from nothing except it's own weight. Auto body shop welds door back in place, expresses uncertainty as to the cause of such a problem. Estimated time until door falls off again: indefinite. 

1995: Heat fails. Now takes 1/2 hour to heat car up on cold wintery days.

1999: Door falls off again. On Route 93 going through Boston toward Logan Airport. Nearly smashes into traffic.Door Has to be bungie corded. 

1999: Car stalls out constantly. Ignition Coils and plugs replaced. Car continues to stall out. (Car has automatic transmission: makes history by being the first car of it's kind to stall out while AUTOMATICALLY CHANGING GEARS)

1999: I write this gleaming review of the Dodge Caravan line of motor vehicles, which I consider to be one of the greatest threats ever posed on America's economy.

Goddamn that car. Don't buy dodge. You'll regret it. Get a nice foreign vehicle.
