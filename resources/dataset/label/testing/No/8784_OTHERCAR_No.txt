            The Kodak mc3 got me really excited.  I searched to find it everywhere when I heard about it.  I bought the first one I could find, and with trembling hands took it out of the box.  It was soo pretty and compact, I took it everywhere for a week.  I had 3 small songs on my memory card and always came home with a card full of photos and small video.  It is really fun to play with.  I was humming 'King of the road' everyday to work.  

After the 3rd day of use, I had tons of photos that I wanted to load up to the web and impress all of my friends with video clips on my website.  I spent the next 2 days working on my photos in photoshop, and editing my video clips to make them longer, cleaner, etc.  When I looked at my new photos after, I got discouraged.  2 days of work for this!?!  the photos were too small, and blowing them up revealed too many flaws.  The let down of thinking you gave a great picture, and then find out that it didn't come out that puts a damper on the spirits.  I changed my mp3's from 'King of the road', 'low rider' and Blur's 'song #2' to "Stormy Monday Blues', 'Jet plane' and John Lee Hooker's 'boom boom'.  Man did I have the blues.

I went back to Kodak to buy another memory card.  Something big and Juicy that would hold a lot of music.  I found out that the memory card that I wanted would cost the same as the camera!!!  This is one expensive toy!

Sadly, after a week, I boxed up my pretty new toy, and handed it back in.  I will have to settle for scanning my point and shoot camera and animating rapid photo shoots.

Yes, it plays mp3's.
Yes, it takes digital pictures.
Yes, it will take video, too.
All for a good price.
but if you don't take good pictures, or your video is choppy, you won't like the pictures you take, and the photos look like crap.  Given a few years of development, this product will be much better.
