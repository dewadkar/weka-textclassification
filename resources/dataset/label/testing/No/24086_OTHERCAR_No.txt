            I had wanted a digital camera for a long time and not having much money I decided to try Ebay. There are many digital cameras on Ebay and being a novice shopper of digital camera and a novice to Ebay didn't help making a decision easy. The Relisy's Dimera 3500 seemed like a great camera to go for. So the bidding began, and at the end of the exciting auction I was the proud owner of the camera!

The problems began when I tried to install the software for my camera. The soft ware wasn't compatible with one of the programs I use often, and everytime I attempted to download my pictures off my camera I would afterwards have to reinstall this program. I also found the software with the camera time consuming to use. The camera in itself was easy to use but I also was a bit disappointed in the quality of the pictures. 


I do think the Relisys Dimera 3500 makes a good camera for the beginner photographer and also is a good deal if you do not have much money to spend.
