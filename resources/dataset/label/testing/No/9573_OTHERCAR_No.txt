            I being a solidified and hardened car buyer have been through many of the cars available, both cheap and expensive.  Although I used to own an 88 Toyota that I sold a few years ago, that didn't improve anything.  I enjoyed my old Toyota Celica, but recently Toyota has been slacking off in the areas of: room, accessories, engine, and shocks. But Toyota also has some good features like: price, and design. Let me explain.

In the Celica 2000, the amount of room you would find is UNBELIEVABLY little.  Im a adult male of average height(5'11&quot;), and there is no space after I push the seat back.  None, and I'm still cramped with the seat as far back as it goes!  Im am also very unhappy with the accessories that were included.  In the basic package, the CD and Tape deck were NOT standard, to get them that required an upgrade.  Also, the quality of the seats(the seating covers) was horrible, the standard cover was some nasty fabric that smelled real bad! Another Con is that if you don't want a moon roof(my father doesn't hes allergic to UV) you don't have a choice, that moonroof IS standard! If you were to buy the more expensive model, things were better, you had the CD player, and the leather seats(which I have to say, actually smelled nice).   Another Con is the fact that the engine that comes standard, well, stinks!! The acceleration is horrible, and it's one of the most noisest I have ever heard, I couldn't even talk to the dealer!  When and if you upgrade, you get a Turbo engine that seems to increase in power and acceleration(this engine seemed to be the MOST powerful I had ever tried.  But the difference between the standard and upgradeable engines was enormous.  Another bad thing about the 2000 Celica is the shocks, that [standard]car will bump and bruise you right out of your seat.  Since it's such a small car, you always have the steering wheel or some other odd object banging into strange parts of your body.

But there are definetly some Plus's in the new Celica.  One big and huge benefit since the last years model, is the design.  This car looks so sleek you would be just BEGGING for attention.  The inside also has some great lighting effects if you were to be driving at night, looks almost like a Christmas tree.  And the biggest of all Plus's that knock most of the Minuse's out of the water is the price.  This sleekly designed motor vehicle will knock the socks off a luxury/sports car owner when you tell them that the price was only near $15,000!

If you were to buy a Celica from Toyota, I would suggest spending the few extra thousand dollars to upgrade, because the Celica isn't anything without the upgraded package, but is definetly something with it.<br><br>
