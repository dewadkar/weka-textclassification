            I bought a 1993 cutlass supreme coupe in 1998 for 6,000$ and with 74k miles on it.  It was cheap only because the previous owner died and the new owners only wanted to pay off the loan for it.  It was a good car that never burned oil or required much work except for brakes and tires.  However after owning for about a year the flasher unit went out on it.  Very cheap to fix but something that should never fail on a car and something that led to bigger problems.  A couple months later I had some of the dashboard lights turn on and off at will (lights like the seat belts light).  I brought the car in for this and they said a computer had died on it.  A year later I blew out more flasher units and the fuses to them and when I brought that in they told me that there were shorts in the dashboard and that they would have to take it all a part and take out the steering column to repair it.  Later they went on to explain that when they were already in the dashboard that more wires would have to be replaced soon.  The reasons for this was because they had no protection for wires to rub up against the steering column and that just by time of steering this was bound to happen.

So why would anyone want a car where you can't even trust the wires in a car.  When I complained to Oldsmobile about this they did nothing and I believe that such a obvious problem should be taken care of because every time the wires went out I had no flashers.  I believe that would make the car non-street legal.  And what would have happened if other things would have went out. (like head lights, windshield wipers, dashboard)  I think that this car can become very dangerous!
