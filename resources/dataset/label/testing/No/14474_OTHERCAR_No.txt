            Many years ago, back in England, I learnt to drive in a Land Rover. It was a long wheelbase Defender vehicle with wooden seats in the back. If you so much as looked at it the wrong way some sharp edge on the inside would scratch you. I loved that car � mainly because as a teenager it withstood all the dings and clips and near-misses I threw at it. It even had a farm tractor run into the back of it and bounce off. Ah, those were the days..

Moving on. Land Rover introduced the Discovery to fill the gap between the good ol� Defender model and the super-luxury Range Rover. At least in the US it has been their best selling model, although it certainly isn�t setting the SUV world aflame with massive sales. Once you get past the exterior of the vehicle it is easy to understand why.

Maybe it�s all that royal blue blood flowing through my veins, but you can�t help but get the image of some upper-class English twit (an Alistair or Bertram) driving around in one of these things. It just has an image of eccentricity with that unique utilitarian touch. That funky looking moonroof and the weird shaped side windows add to the image.

It is only after you climb into one of these beasts that you discover it is all a veneer. My first experience with a Disco II was literally trying to climb into the back seat. The rear doors are smaller than you would expect and the entrance is just ergonomically wrong. Don�t even think about clambering into the back seat from the front either. Once you are in the rear seats you actually have a better view than most other SUVS � both forwards and sidewards � as the rear seats are elevated. There is also no question you have plenty of headroom and legroom, but somewhere the designers forgot to include an additional inch or two for the shoulders. Its tight in there !!

Fixtures and features are pretty much what you would expect. The Disco II, as of 2001, comes with three levels of trim � the SD, LE and SE. Interestingly enough, rear A/C is an extra-cost option, as is the Self-Levelling Suspension (SLS). Every model comes with Hill Descent Control, which assists the engine in gearing down when descending steep or slippery slopes. Couple this with the always-on 4WD, traction control and electronic brake distribution and you have a SUV that handles itself very well on or off the road. The original Series I has some major problems with stability in high winds or when diagonally traversing slopes. I drove this car with a 30mph cross-wind and it felt stable, although wind-noise was excessive compared to say a Pathfinder or Explorer.

Performance brings us to the engine � its get-up-and-go has got-up-and-left. <B>Everybody</b> complains about performance, and looking at the statistics you can understand why. The engine is a 8 cylinder 4 litre job producing 188 horsepower. That puts it over 50 horses behind some of the new 240hp V6�s supplied by the Japanese 2001 SUVs. The Disco II can tow over 3 tons, and it sometimes felt like I already had that load behind me as I was pulling away from lights and toll-booths. Mileage is 13/17 city/highway coupled with a 25 gallon tank.

The actual driving experience, asides from the engine, was most certainly pleasant. I was touched by the way the engineers had kept the original vertical handles, but not so touched by the gauge visibility afforded through the oversize steering wheel. The vehicle responded well to the wheel, had a sharp turning circle and truly awesome brakes. The 10 channel, 220 watt audio system matches up well against the competition, and the heated front seats are a delight for cold winter mornings.
