              My dissapointment in American consumers when it comes to digital cameras is high.  The Sony Mavica is one of the most poorly designed digital cameras i have ever seen but yet people keep buying them!  I think due to brand name recognizability and general lack of knoweldge about digital cameras.  
  Why dont i like this camera? lets start with the worst feature: floppy disk storage.  The floppy disk is a horrible storage medium for digital photographs.  Small storage capacity and large physical size make it a bad choice.  Many cameras use flash media which is a quarter the size of a floppy and can store up to 88 times the data.  Yes flash media is more expensive but would you rather carry two 1 sqin flash cards or over a 150 floppies.  The small storage size of floppies means that images need to be compressed which causes them to lose quality. 
  These cameras are also big and bulky making them hard to hold comfortably and difficult to store. If you are considering the Mavica for its Mpeg video option dont even bother because its not worth it.  The quality is bad and you cant record for long enough to make it worth doing.
I would reccomend you look at Olympus cameras they are in my oppinion the best, other cameras worth looking at are Nikons.<br><br>
