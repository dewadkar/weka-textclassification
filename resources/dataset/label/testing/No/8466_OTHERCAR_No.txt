            I would not have invested that much money into the Olympus C-3030 camera. Yeah, i was looking for a high-end digital 3 and over megapixel camera. and somehow i decided on this.
(I only wished I had read epinions first!).

My biggest gripe is the so-called macro mode. if that's macro mode then i am not a living breathing human being. that was a rip-off! (I should get them for false advertising).

My next big gripe is the un-user friendliness of this camera. it is NOT an easy tool to use.  Yeah, if you only want to point and shoot, then it's great... but start wanting to change the F-Stop, shutter speed, change to black and white... and you're in for a steep learning curve.

when i buy a camera, i expect it to be very easy to use and if i read the instruction manual i hope to get it the FIRST time. I have to CARRY my manual with me with this camera.

my main problem is that i still don't understand how to keep a setting. when i set it to black and white i have to take the photo then and there cause once i turn the camera off and on, the settings don't stick. (Yes, i did read the instructions.  and yes, i followed them-- but something just doesn't jive.

i became most disgusted when i began to take remote-control pictures.  my friends almost went home because of the time it took me to get it together. oh, well, i just decided to buy a Nikon CoolPix 995. talk about ease of use! Yayyyyy!

this camera does have top of the lines features such as:

-sound
-movie recording
-3.34 megapixels
-panoramic pictures
-capable of showing pictures on television from camera
-totally manual mode and auto mode.

overall it's a good camera, but just not that user friendly. i'm quite turned away of the macro mode feature.--i give it a ZERO on that feature.
