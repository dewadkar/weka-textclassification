            I rented this car on our last trip to Block Island.  I'll tell ya, I felt like a million bucks while driving around in the sun with the tunes cranked and the wind blowing through my hair but MAN am I glad I didn't purchase this car.  
1) You've got to be Xena (or Hercules) to pull the top closed; People in the restaurant we pulled into were laughing at me as I struggled with it.
2) The controls are not easily accessible.
3) The automatic transmission didn't feel completely under control; I felt as though I was at the mercy of the road rather than vice versa.
4) It's creaky - maybe that's typical of a convertible but it felt unsafe.
So, my opinion is if you're going for a fun, wind-in-your-hair car, there's probably a better one out there for the bucks.  If you're renting for a day, it's not so bad.<br><br>
