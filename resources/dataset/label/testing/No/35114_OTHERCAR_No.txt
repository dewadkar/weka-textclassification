            I bought this camera from an auction on ebay.  I was looking for a digital camera with zoom and movie making capabilities, but I also wanted something I could afford.  Ebay is like the place to go and so I went to look for a good affordable camera.  Somehow I wandered on to the Olympus C-211, and I looked at the price and I was like "Woah.  It's selling at less than $200!"  Which at the time was less than half the retail price, so I read some reviews and the only negative quality that stuck with me was the size of the camera.  5.5 x 7 x 2.3.  Which really didn't seem bad at first so I thought the only negative thing I needed to deal with was the size and bulk of the camera.  Big deal right?  

The down sides:
I was wrong it was a big deal.  Carrying the camera around could be a chore sometimes.  Due to its size, its like carrying a textbook around.  So the best thing to do is use the shoulder strap that comes with it.  The down side of that is that you may look like a tourist with a huge camera around your neck/shoulder.  Well that's what you get for having a printer.  Thing is I never had the need to use the printer, which I thought would have been very helpful if I was at a party or something where people wanted their pictures taken and I wasn't near a computer.

As I said before I was looking for a camera with movie shooting capability.  I should of bought a camcorder if I wanted to make video and clips...  The quicktime video clips, are mediocre at best.  The action was jerky and lighting was just plain bad.  There's no sound by the way.  I was pretty disappointed.  What disappointed me even more was the fact that the video clips don't last more than 15 seconds.  Due to my inexperience I didn't realize that this was because of the memory card that came with the camera but rather this was because of the inner workings of the camera.  Still what nailed me the most was there was no sound.

This camera eats up batteries like I have never seen before.  Since this camera doesn't come with an optical viewfinder you need to use the LCD screen which uses up quite a bit of power.  If I didn't use rechargeable batteries I think I'd be poor by now...  

The in between:
The C-211 Zoom comes with it's own printer (hence the size).  Having the printer isn't bad.  I used it a few times just to see how it works.  The pictures are pretty bad.  The texture is somewhat grainy and also the color isn't all that great either.

The up sides:
I have a little experience with other cameras, lets just say this one is easy to use with a nice set of functions.  I didn't need to use the manual and I was able to use the most basic of functions and how to shoot movies, and how to focus manually.

I got a good price on it, people who want to buy one today can get an even better price.  (like saving $20+)  But most likely they won't have much of a warrantee since I bought mine from an ebay auction.  Since I bought it for so cheap I really didn't expect much, but still inside I can't help but feel a little bit disappointed.

The zoom is nice, 3x Optical zoom and 2x digital.  But that's pretty much standard with the digital cameras these days, and obviously newer cameras are going to have better zooming capabilities.  Still I think the zoom is pretty smooth and it shows up well.
