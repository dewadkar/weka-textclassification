            I have a 92 Galant which was bought brand new back in 92. It was a very good car at the beginning when it was still new. Four or Five years down the road, the car began to break down on me. I have to constant take the car to the shop and get it fix. There is alway some kind problem with the car. Everytime it is in the shop it cost me alot of money. As a college student I don't have much money to spend on fixing the car. I already have to worry about paying tuition and now I got to worry about fixing the car. It doesn't seem liek the car can ever be fix. I even havew to take over a year off from school just work and save up some money to fix the car and try to save up for college. This whole time I was able to save up money for one semester of college and now I am in debt.<br><br>
