              I have been driving a 1996 Legacy Outback for four years, so now is the time to start looking for a replacement. I have been very happy with my Legacy so decided to stay with Subaru.
  Went to my local Subaru dealer to look at the Forester, I had seen ads on TV, and wanted to check it out. 
  The Forester looks nice, a little boxy, but has good head room. All the dials and gadgets are great, just like in the Legacy Outback, so far so good. I wanted lots of luggage space so went to the back to check out the size of the trunk area. This is where I was disappointed, Just a small area, seemed like half the area that I have in my Outback. The cost is about the same so for more room and I think a bitter looking car, I vote for the Outback!<br><br>
