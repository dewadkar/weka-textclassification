            I bought my 89 348TS in 1993 with about 10k miles. One advantage to buying a used Ferrari is that it is easy to find examples that have been babied and/or hardly used at all. Mine was no exception - it wasn't much different from a new car.

I have to relate a funny but true story. This was my first truly expensive toy. Up until the time I purchased the car, I was simply another starving software writer, who happened to enjoy working on cars.

On the first day I drove the car, I took it to visit a good friend to show off the new wheels, and I parked it in front of his house with the front hood open. I turned away for only a moment, and looked back just in time to see one of the local cats in the trunk, peeing on one of my shirts. In hindsight the cat's opinion of my purchase should have been a warning to me.

At the time, I had been driving a 1992 Toyota MR2 Turbo, which had been rumored to have been inspired by the 348. Setting them side-by-side, the rumor seems credible. One can see a clear family resemblance.

My first long trip in the 348 was from San Francisco to Seattle. I experienced a few problems on the trip. 

First, the battery connectors are set up with quick connects. I suppose it's to give the impression of a real "racing" vehicle, but on my car the positive connector didn't seat very well, so every so often a sharp bump would cause a hiccup in the engine compartment until I figured out what was going on. 

Second, the seats are horribly uncomfortable. I had a serious back ache by the time I arrived in Seattle. 

Third, the shifter action was stiff, as was the clutch - monstrously so.

I drove the car around Seattle for about a year or so and managed to put around 10k more miles on before selling it. I never had any major problems with the car, except for the clutch going out, which I replaced myself, and a valve adjustment. However, there were several minor problems.

The clutch replacement brings up an interesting point about Ferrari. I had naively assumed that Ferrari, being an "enthusiast" car, would cater to people who liked to work on their own vehicles. On the contrary, the dealership was only grudgingly helpful with obtaining the proper tools and manuals, and the service manuals that you can easily obtain are more like marketing materials. The job itself turned out to be a snap. The orientation of the engine, with the clutch to the rear makes for what must be the easiest clutch replacement I've ever done. Just pop the bell housing, swap parts and you're in business. 

The valve adjust was equally simple. It's a fairly straightforward bucket and shim arrangement not unlike a modern VW. The only trick is the special tools you need (see above) which I still own, if anyone is interested.

I would sum up my experience this way:

The seats are pretty bad. Don't plan on any long trips.

The shifter and clutch seem designed to produce a "Ferrari Feel" rather than an optimum action.

The dashboard adhesive was defective, and I ended up removing the entire dash, which fortunately was pretty simple, so that the vinyl could be reglued.

The "wings" above the rear intakes create a sharp angle in the bodywork where cracks in the paint form. They are minor, but later years had a line of black sealant in this area to hide it.

The paint over the engine louvers flaked off with time, probably due to the heat. 

The handling was odd. I took it be aligned by Ferrari of Seattle (they sent it out), and I still wasn't happy when I got it back. I loaned the car to a friend of mine who has other Ferraris and he agreed that the handling was strange. I've driven a few Maseratis at speed, and they just sat down and felt solid when driven fast, but the Ferrari always made me feel uncomfortable. I recall hearing that the suspension was changed on later models. The story was that the handling on earlier models was too "race like". Yeah sure.

The removable top wasn't the best quality. Not terrible, but improvements could have been made.

There is an unfortunate problem with owning a car this eye-catching. Whenever you drive it somewhere, people naturally want to check it out. However, they don't want you to catch them staring, so they tend to hang out in your blind spots which makes for interesting lane changes. This problem is aggravated because the 348 doesn't have great visibility to the rear sides of the car.

Of course, my complaints are hardly important to most people who might buy this car. They would be mostly concerned with the "wow" factor. This car definitely has that. However, you should ask yourself honestly why you really want this car. If picking up young men is your gig, then this is definitely the car for you, because no matter where you stop, a small crowd of teenage boys will form and pester you with questions. On the other hand, the car drives away interesting women who tend to assume you are an arrogant bastard and/or compensating for something. Naturally, there are plenty of worthless babes who will be drawn to it like flies. Again, if that's your gig...

Another thing to consider is what you will actually do with the darn thing. It has to be garaged, and every outing involves a great deal of mental planning about things such as whether the curbs will be too high for the car to get over, whether there will be parking places with no fools around to ding the doors, whether someone will key it, whether you feel like fielding questions from curious onlookers, and on and on.

Ironically, all things considered the MR2 was definitely the better car. In fact, the MR2 is the only car I ever regret having sold. It was comfortable, reliable, fast and handled great. it was also about one tenth the cost of the 348. Of course, that is the subject of another review. 

I should say that despite the problems, the car was far better than my expectations. Aside from cosmetic issues, the mechanicals seemed well designed, well laid out and reliable. Of course, 10k miles hardly constitutes an extended test.

In the end there is only one valid reason to buy this car: if you gotta have it, you gotta have it. In the end, I didn't.

To the fanatical Ferrari enthusiast, I will have to admit one thing. From time to time I see a 348 drive by on the street, and every time I imagine that I feel a bit like a recovering alcoholic who happens by a brightly lit neighborhood bar. The lights, tinkling laughter, the flashing smiles on the pretty faces. For a moment I'm tempted to dart inside for just one drink. Be strong, be strong...
