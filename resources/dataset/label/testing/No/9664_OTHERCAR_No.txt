            When I turned 17 and got my license, the first car I had was a Gremlin. At the time, i thought it was horrible. I would be more than happy to have that car now. 
In may of 1997, I bought a Dodge Neon. I thought it was cute and the price of it was great. I did an extensive background check on the car, but unfortunitly at the time, the model was new and not too many customers had had the chance to purchase one. 
In my opinion, the Dodge Neon is the worst car ever made. I have had so many problems with that car. From the little things like the speakers constantly blowing(and no I don't listen to the radiio too loud), to the bigger things like burning a full tank of gas in an hour. And believe me, there were many other things in between those. 
At the moment, I'm dealing with the steering. The entire front alignment has shifted. Granted I'm just some 20 year old kid who probably doesn't treat things the way they should be treated, but under no circumstance did I do anything to this car to make it react the way it has been. Right now I would be happy to get my old Gremlin back. I guess it just shows that when you're planning on purchasing something like a car, the price shouldn't be the main thing that makes up a persons mind. <br><br>
