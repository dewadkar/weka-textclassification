            **Update 12/08/03**

My Mazda 6 with 11,580 miles would not start this morning. It wasn't the battery and it wasn't a fuel line problem (I'm still waiting to see why). 

It was towed to a local dealer through Mazda's Roadside assistance program (the woman on the phone was less than pleasant). I was given a loaner car after arguing with the service manager for a solid 30 minutes that my contract with Mazda enabled me to get a car, whether or not they had one on the lot.

End result, I was 2 hours late to work and very frustrated. I'm giving myself 2 options: if they fix the problem I'm selling the car. If they don't, I'm invoking the "lemon law" as a New York State resident. Either way I'm getting rid of the 6. 

What does this mean for you? DON'T BUY THE 6. IT'S UNRELIABLE AND IT WILL LEAVE YOU, LIKE ME, OUT IN THE COLD (LITEREALLY).

**Below is the rest of my 10,000 mile revised review on the 6**

The original 'Buyer Beware' review told of my aggravating first couple of months owning a 03 Mazda 6s. The review detailed the many problems that had been occurring with the car, most namely a broken engine seal and an electrical system that was going haywire. 

The review conveyed my aggravation at having to spend countless hours at my local Mazda dealer and the fact that it seemed like I was driving a loaner car, a beat up Kia, more than I was spending in my, recently purchased 6s. 

So, after putting 10,000 miles on the Mazda 6s, here are my thoughts.

After the original spate of problems there was a refreshing 2 months of worry free driving. The 6 carried me beautifully all around the North East turning heads with every flick of the turn signal. The admittedly weak, but more than enough, V6 got me where I was going, probably a little faster than the local law enforcement would have liked.

The ample trunk space and the 60/40 rear folding seats (with a great feature that lets you release the seats from the trunk) helped carry my belongings in a job-relocation move. 

The cockpit design has become very intuitive, I effortlessly change stereo modes, operate the automatic air and contrast of dashboard lights while maintaining my focus on driving. The indash 6 disk changer and Bose sound system are wonderful. 

The seats are very ergonomic, a few stretches are required after a few hours of driving but in what car don't you need to shift positions? The soft leather seats provide ample cushioning while remaining firm. A note on the subject: the electronic adjusting drivers seat should not fool you, the passenger seat is manually operated. A rather chincy maneuver by Mazda if you ask me. 

Storage space in the 6 has proven to be more than ample both in the trunk, and in the various compartments for things like CD cases, sunglasses (with their separate holder) and maps. There are enough cup-holders built into the car to accommodate a small ocean of big gulps (although many fast food "large" sodas won't fit in the non-adjustable cup-holders) if I was so inclined. The in dash compartment seems wasted without a GPS or a flat panel TV resting inside, but alas that option isn't available to me in the U.S. unless I do it aftermarket (which I just might).

The rearview mirror compass is a nicety that has a bit of practicality to it, calming myself when I think I'm heading in the wrong direction. 

The mpg isn't all that bad, with a manual I'm averaging about 28 highway and 23 city although those numbers could be slightly off because the Mazda lacks a trip computer - you know, the one that comes standard on the A4. I'm spending about $20 a week on gas but then again I live in NY state and we seem to be a solid 40 cents higher than the East Coast at all times (my heart goes out to you Phoenix drivers). 

The 5 speed manual transmission is smooth, not fast, not sluggish, it does what I want it to do allowing for a comfortable ride. Sometimes I long for a 6 speed but the engine really doesn't warrant one - it's hyped as having 'zoom zoom' but I prefer to think of it as 'let's go, let's go'. The clutch is starting to make a squeek when depressed. Anyone that's owned a manual Mazda is probably familiar with the noise I'm talking about, it's slightly irritating but nothing more. 2 other Mazda drivers in my office (one 626 one Prot�g�) both report their cars make the same noise.

Strange noises seem to be a theme in my 6. In addition to the clutch there's a very loud, very frightening noise that occurs when I back up and turn the wheel. I've had it looked at by 2 separate Mazda dealers and both hear the noise but neither can figure out what makes it so they send me on my way telling me that "as it progresses in time it will be easier to diagnose". Apparently a screeching noise that makes small children cry isn't apparent enough. I've contacted MazdaUSA about the problem and they are less than helpful.

The automatic climate control has a little defect too. No matter what temperature is set the AC initially comes on. Mind you it can be 10 degrees in the car with the climate control set to 85 and the AC will still come on. Annoying - nothing more.

Other problems I have are 2 recall notices on the car. A fairly common occurrence in first model year cars (I've forever learned my lesson) but still very annoying. And it seems that Mazda doesn't communicate with their service techs because I received both recalls less than a week after taking the car in for service. You'd think they would flag it in their computer that while the car was at the dealer they could perform the necessary recall work. Maybe the dealers are too apathetic about pleasing customers they already have money from. Maybe they like billing Mazda for extra warranty work. In any case as the driver, I'm getting shafted.

After 10,000 miles do I feel like I got a good value for the money paid on the car? Yes and no. If the car worked as it was designed to I'd still believe that it was a smart purchase however with the repeated problems and the fear of what's going to go wrong in the future it's not worth the hassle. In hindsight I might have been better off with the Altima or even spending a few extra grand on an A4. 

Would I recommend this car to a friend? Sure, if they like hanging out at service stations. I wouldn't sell my car to a friend - because I'd loose them as a friend. I'd like to believe that my 6 is the only one in this world that has a myriad of problems, but I'm cynical and believe if there's one there's probably several more out there just like mine.

What would I change about the Mazda 6? As far as design - not much - just a few small things. I'd make fog lamps standard, make GPS available an option, make adjustable cupholders - nothing major. I would have waited another year and hammered out all the kinks. Mazda has forever lost me as a future customer and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Should you buy this car? Look into it. I enjoy mine when it's working properly. Just be warned that it's reliability resembles more of a 1982 Geo than a brand new Japanese car. 

What should you pay? The options are bundled very inconveniently in an attempt to bilk you into buying stuff you don't necessarily want/need. Use it as a negotiating tool - walk away from the dealer saying that they lost the sale because you didn't want to pay for a 6 disk changer. They'll come running after you&#133 
For a loaded 6s you can talk them into around 23,000-24,000.
