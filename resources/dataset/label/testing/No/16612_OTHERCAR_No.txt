            When I first drove the Catera I thought, &quot;WOW, this is an awesome car.&quot;  It handles nice, performs good, not great but good.  It is tight, quiet and nimble.  Everything I heard was true, it does ZIG, so I bought one.  Little did I know it was going to be one of the biggest disappointments that I have ever had!

I bought my first 1998 Catera and had no end of problems with it.  I had everything from doors not unlocking, the check engine light staying on, to the vehicle not starting and leaving me sitting on the side of the road.  I owned the vehicle a total of 10 months and it was in the shop for 3 1/2 months of that time.  Most of the problems were powertrain and electrical problems.  I talked to about 5 other Catera owners and 4 out of the 5 have not had good experiences with them and were also very displeased with the car.

So after about 6 months of phone calls, and complaining to Cadillac customer service, Cadillac finally contacted me and offered to replace the car with a new 1999 Catera.  I questioned this but they assured me that the 1999 Catera was &quot;so much better than the 1998 and all the problems were fixed&quot;, so I agreed.

I have now had my 1999 Catera for 4 months and it has been in the shop for a total of a combined 6 weeks now.  Yes the old problems were fixed but they broke many other things in the process.  The day I picked the car up, I never got it off the lot before the first thing broke on it.  The rear power sunshade was not working.  The problems just esciladed from there.  The radio would loose it's memory after you shut the car off, the right rear strut was bad and it took almost one month of me telling the dealer what was wrong and the service manager almost spinning out on the road before they would do anything about it.  When the vehicle is cold, it has a terrible hesitation in it.  You have to let the vehicle warm up for 3 minutes before you can move it and the check engine light is not an uncommon light to see illuminated on the dash when you're driving down the road.

The transmission is another thing.  When it is cold, sometime it works fine, other times it will not shift out of first gear until it warms up.  If you try to merge on the expressway or pass another vehicle, sometime it will not downshift even when it is in the proper range.  Most of the problems with the vehicle are the fact that the car is an Opel and the knowledge to fix it is over in Germany.  GM does not have the proper resources to fix it when they have a major problem like this one.  When I asked the dealer what to do about the cold running problem and the sticky transmission, they did not know what to do any more.  They have exhausted all there resources and really could not do anymore for me.  Is that something you would like to hear?

Think about this, I have taken the car to the biggest and most knowledgeable Cadillac dealer in the US and they are telling me they have no idea what is wrong with my car.  If you purchased a car that stickers for $38,303, would you want to hear this?  Would you want to make weekly trips to the dealer where everyone in the place knows you by name because you have spend many hours there trying to get your car fixed?  I really don't think you would.

The Catera is a nice car, I like the package, GM just needs to seriously   re-think what it has done to the Catera and the Cadillac name with this car in my opinion.<br><br>
