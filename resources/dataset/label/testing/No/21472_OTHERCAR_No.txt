            Oh!  Poor disillusioned Lincoln, what DID you do?  My first experience with a Mark VIII was as a loaner car from the dealer when I took my Mark VII in for an extended service.  First impression: &quot;What a 'swoopy' design!&quot;  Then the newness faded and I became critical- &quot;Hmm, lots of cheap plastic&quot;, &quot;Why are the seats so flat?&quot;, &quot;Where's the rest of the gadgets on the trip computer?&quot;, &quot;Why don't they want me to see the engine?&quot;, etc.  Upon return, I was hit up by the salesman to purchase a new Mark VIII, which for a second I considered until he told me the price at which point I let out a loud, uncontrollable gaffaw and looked to see if he was kidding.  He wasn't.  Cut to 2 years later and my girlfriend looking for a new car.  She liked my Mark VII, but wanted something more contemporary.  Ta-da!  There we were buying one of those damn Mark VIIIs!  It was an off-lease 1993 with low mileage and was less expensive than the Lexus and Jaguar coupes we also looked at and she liked the color.  Atleast she stayed in the Lincoln family~

Shortly thereafter the problems started...sunroof went ballistic, transmission shifted &quot;oddly&quot; and frequently (told that was normal), seats refused to return to original position when moved forward to get to back seat (first passenger, then the driver's side), trunk refused to close without being slammed, the hinge that connects the seatback to seat bottom cut through the leather and left the metal exposed, ignition on steering wheel came out, auto climate control fascia craked, chrome on front grill &quot;disappeared&quot; (I wasn't driving THAT fast!), plasti-chrome trim on the outside hazed like it was perpetually dirty, and engine hesitation.

Whomever designed the interior should be shot (and I volunteer to do it!)  The seats lack the support of the Mark VII's articulated sport seats, the console is too narrow, if you smoke you have to be a contortionist to use the ashtray, the cupholder was good for change, but not much else, the steering wheel felt off center and it was hard to get comfortable behind the wheel, did they shrink the back seat?  And the #1 thing that Pi$$ed me off every time, &quot;Where's the frickin' seatbelt?&quot;- why not have a little holder/guide for the seatbelt to keep better track of it?  My Mark VIIs had it...&lt;grumble, grumble&gt; And WHAT did they do to the trunk?  I was told it was designed to be shallower and flatter so the octogenarians could better utilize it.  That's nice, but now the groceries get squashed!

I did not enjoy this vehicle and not just for first year foibles.  WAY too much plastic in this caliber of vehicle, poor trim materials and fit and finish.  And I think the dealer's service staff was as tired of seeing me as I was of seeing them.

I did enjoy the '97 LSC MUCH more and seems that they sorted out a lot of the problems of the 93-96.  If THAT was the car I drove in 1993, I would have written out the check and not thought twice.  After driving it for 2 days while the '93 was waiting for parts, I was starting to become smitten.  I figured another year of dragging the '93 in and the dealer would give us a new one to keep me away, but Lincoln in it's infinite wisdom killed off the Mark series.  Alas, no more new Mark for me.<br><br>
