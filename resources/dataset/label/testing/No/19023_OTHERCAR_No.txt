            TAKE MY ADVICE...DO NOT BUY A MERCURY TOPAZ...YOU WILL REGRET IT FROM THE DAY THE CAR DIES TO THE DAY THAT YOU DIE, I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT!! My grandmother bought me my 4-door 4-cylinder 1994 Mercury Topaz for my 17th birthday in 1997. It seemed like a good, common car for me to start out with. Well, if I had known how much trouble it was going to give me, I would have been smarter and SAVED money by buying a new car at the time. Since I've had it, I've had to spend thousands of dollars (at least $5000 so far) to keep it &quot;alive&quot;. I had to have the transmission rebuilt, the engine almost fell out of the car, the battery, starter and solenoid switch all had to be replaced, the locks on the driver's side do not work anymore, the automatic seatbelt motor has died and makes an AWFUL noise EVERY time I open or close either of the front doors, the speedometer and odometer do not work, the air conditioning has ceased, to have a simple wheel alignment I had to have the $600 boots replaced first, the brakes have had to be replaced a number of times. The list goes on and on. I can't drive one straight distance that is longer than 2 hours or it will constantly stall and make a &quot;putting&quot; noise. The engine makes a chirping sound. I have 3 friends that had/have the same car and ALL of our problems are the same, right down to the doors not locking properly and the seatbelt motor being dead. I hate driving it. I feel like I should have a cell phone just for the purpose of taking it with me and taping my AAA membership card to the back so that I won't get stranded in some distant deserted place when it decides to die. <br><br>
