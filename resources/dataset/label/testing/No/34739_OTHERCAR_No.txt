            I owned the 1997 Passat VR6 GLX for 3 years (bought used in 1999). The previous owner was a business-woman from Connecticut so I figured there wasn't much wear on the vehicle before I bought it. This car served me well during the three years I owned it, but I was very displeased with all the money I had to re-invest into it over that time. 

The car is a dream to drive, in addition to all the luxuries available at the time, the car has the sporty VR6 6-cylinder engine (about 176 hp). This engine is awesome and got me out of a lot of sticky situations. Also, the trunk is huge and the back seats fold down for even more space. yada yada, the car is sweet.

Now I would still be driving this car if it hadn't cost so much to operate.A lube, oil, filter jobs cost around $80 each time (in part because a fuel filter is recommended each time, $40) and finding someone to work on it is pretty hard. My windows ceased to roll up or down and the replacement parts cost $60. The sunroof broke; that cost $150. Did i mention that labor on german cars is outrageous. For no reason whatsoever, the coolant pump's housing cracked and began leaking coolant all over the place ($40 per bottle of coolant only available from VW). To fix this, the engine needed to be dropped out of my car and left in the shop for 3 days, the bill was $2,000+.....
Sometimes the car simply wouldn't start, I once actually towed the car from my driveway to the dealer. Did i also mention that there is a $50 diagnostic fee for "plugging the car into the computer to see what is wrong", EACH TIME YOU BRING THE CAR TO THE DEALER!

My point is that if you love cars and understand how to work with them, especially german cars, then this car is for you. I loved driving it, but if you hate hassle, and the possibility of putting another 5k back into this car, stay away.
