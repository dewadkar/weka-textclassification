            This car was exactly what I wanted - practical for those sports outings, decent mileage, and fun to drive.  The performance is great and it feels like a quality vehicle.  The handling is top-notch and the quattro had gotten me out of more than one jam (as long as you continue to add gas).  5-speed is very peppy (the tiptronic is known as being much slower).

But am I the only one that has had constant services problems with the car?

I could go on and on: 
- airbag light has switched on twice (once an electrical problem, another time the rear seatbelts were broken)
- the headlights burn out on average once every 6 months 
- speakers buzz and crackle even though I've had the replaced 5 times (!) already
- stereo has the weird phantom station change that someone else mentioned (sometimes when I turn the car back on it's tuned 0.2 higher than before)
- cigarette lighter cover broke twice
- rear windsheild wiper gets stuck (even after getting it replaced)
- check engine light has gone on twice
- major oil leak months after the warranty was up that cost $500

The worst thing is, even when it was under warranty, it wasn't much consolation because getting an appointment was almost impossible.  I've had to wait a month sometimes just to get an appointment!

Another really annoying thing: the windsheild wipers leave streaks and the windsheild fluid runs out really fast.  (I learned how not to hold down the squirter, avoiding having the headlamp washers from coming on, which helps.)  I would expect better from such a high-end car.

So, I have mixed feelings... Just as it seduces me into falling in love again based on the fun handling and elegant styling, another problem crops up.
