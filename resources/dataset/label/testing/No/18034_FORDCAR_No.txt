            The Ford Econoline van was not only a mechanics worst nightmare but also the owners. This van had numerous problems including severe break problems and an overall rough ride from light suspension. The brakes had to be replaced at least every four months and the suspension seamed to always &quot;bottom out&quot; and not provide enough suspension for even the regular trip around town. Sure this van was nice for carrying people and cargo but mechanical problems put this van on the bottom of my list. So if your looking for a van out there I believe that you should shop around some more and definatly not look in to the Ford Econoline van unless your up for a rough ride and spending money on brakes every four months.  I really do not recommend this van to anyone. The ride was horrible, it got about ten miles to the gallon on gas, and used up your money in many other ways.<br><br>
