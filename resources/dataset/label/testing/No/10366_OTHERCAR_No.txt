               I bought my Kia Sephia in 1998. I was a little impulsive when I purchased the Kia. The price was right for me as a struggling college student. I just could not resist the price. The car is best described as a Walmart kind of car. The car has potential but is overall a cheap imitation of the real thing. When you first buy it everything is so new looking and the car smells so good.

    Now, I notice the little details that are missing but that you find in Toyota's and Nissan's. Honestly, the car has been pretty good except for a few things. The first thing is the black finish on the side mirrors has been coming off since the beginning of the second year. The car gets dings all over it from rocks and other people's car doors. The glove compartment open/close latch broke and now I can not get it open. 

   I actually got pulled over by a cop and he asked for my registration. I told him he could see it if he could get my glove compartment open. He let me slide. I had problems with my rotors after only 7 months of ownership. I had a wiring problem at the end of the second year of ownership. The service center is always overbooked and the waiting feels like forever. The parts and labor are horrible. I go to another repair shop and I don't even go to the Kia service shop anymore. I did have a warranty which just ran out. 

   The car has a nice design inside and has a lot of room. The Kia actually has tons of leg room and trunk space. The car has great ac/heat. 
The ride is typical of a compact car. You do feel all the bumps in the road but no different from other sub-compact/compact cars.

    If you are a sucker for excellent quality then you had better plan to spend more money for a new car. If you have a teenager or college student in the house then this would be a good choice for you. I think overall for the price this would be a great choice for a new driver. However, just remember the resell value of a Kia is very bad. I have been in dealership and the salesman have given the look of &quot;Oh man like we would give you anything money for your Kia&quot;. 

   As for myself, I am stuck with my Kia for awhile. I now realize I should have bought something with a better resale value like a Toyota. Well, we all have to learn lessons somewhere.
