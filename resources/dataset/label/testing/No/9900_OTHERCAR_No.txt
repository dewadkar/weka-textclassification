             I purchased a 1998 Dodge Dakota Sport Club Cab. What a piece of junk and you 2000 model buyers I just saw a 2000 in the shop clutch gone less than 1000 Mi no abuse either here are some web sites to check:

www.watsonville.com/dakota/ Both our Vin #s are Similar

www.nhsta.dot.gov

On nhsta follow directions and enter year 98 or 99 I dont think the 2000 is any better My problems are many . I filed lemon law and am awaiting a hearing date. Chrysler customer service is terrible, They keep fixing it but who wants that hassle and they tried before and it did not work. My problems started at 9780 mi. and now 32000 and nothing but trouble in between, not little stuff either Entire cooling system rear end axle brakes 5X so buyer beware I sent Chrysler 89 pages of evidence I will be using at the hearing ( you may ask why i would show my cards? You are required by law ) maybe that will wake them up!!! these are not just ravings from an unsatisfied customer I have owned Dodges for 25 years
No More!!!!!!!!! want more info anything to add? BILLF79@aol.com<br><br>
