            When I bought this camera about a year ago and I took my first few digital pictures with it, I thought I had bought a great camera but time told me I was wrong. The first shortcoming I had with it were the broken latches that fastened the cover for the input sockets. All the buttons for the camera options became harder to operate with the exception of the shutter button. About three months later I started noticing random white spots on the pictures and then after 11 months of use, the play/recording mode switch broke due to its poor design. Now I have a useless camera due to lack of technical support where I live.

In addition to what I have mentioned there are some problems of design: Extreme care must be taken to keep finger out of the photos, due to poor location of the lense. If you change the exposure time setting and turn the camera off, it will go back to the default setting. The AC adapter which you use quite often due to the excessive consumption of batteries is bulky for the size of the camera.  Although the operator's manual recommend not to use the LCD monitor to save batteries, the thumb resting area is positioned for its use. 

Conclusion: I will have second thoughts about buying another digital product from RCA
