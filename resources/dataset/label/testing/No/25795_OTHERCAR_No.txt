            I bought this car used in 1999 and found it in very nice condition.  It was a 4-cylinder LX model with leather, CD & tape players, automatic everything, and a sun roof.  The paint job was smooth and shiny, the interior seemed solid, and the ride and handling were very tight.  A test drive revealed the loud interior, but that did not bother me at the time.  I did not notice any rattles or squeaks in the beginning.

After purchasing this car, I became more and more aware of the cheap plastic interior. On a freshly paved road, it was like driving a brand new car.  But, as soon as it hit a change in surface, the true integrity of the beast came screaming at me.  The cup holders and console area would rub against each other making a terrible squeaking sound.  Within a year, the driver seat developed a squeak that would sound with every right turn.  The controls for the side-view mirrors became completely useless after I bumped them with my knee while entering the car.  As time went on, other loose screws, bolts, and God knows what else began to crop up throughout the car.  

<i>Other areas of dissatisfaction:</i>
- Driveways were always a challenge as the front of the car would never fail to scrape the pavement unless I slowed to a crawl.  This was the same for dips, hills, and any sudden changes in the road.

- The body of the car seems prone to dent easily.

- Even at it's highest setting, the air conditioner fan did not have much force.

- The sun roof motor would struggle every time I used it.

- The power windows could not all be rolled up at the same time.  They would slow down as if the use of more than one took too much power.  Even using just one window was a strain as the whole car would shake slightly from a lack of power.

- The gas tank was too small.  I would have to fill up at least once a week.

<i>The Positives</i>
- The car looks really good when cleaned up.  Mine was black and the paint never seemed to fade.

- The radio and A/C controls were nicely positioned.

- The ride was always very smooth, and the handling always tight.

- I believe the gas millage was good despite my frequent fill-ups.

- The whole interior, including the trunk, was very spacious and roomy.  It was good for long trips.
