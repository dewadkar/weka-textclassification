            I recently purchased a 2003 cavalier for my daughter's 21st birthday. I got it loaded with the 2.4 liter engine and here is how its been. 

I bought a very nice looking red cavalier in June for my daughter she loved the car and I was happy too. I really liked its appearance and the exterior looked to be put together well. The only problem on the outside I saw was the paint wasn't as glossy as my little 2001 hyundai which was also red but thats really nothing. 

As I was driving it to my daughter's house I got a feel for how the inside was and I will admit the seat isn't have bad but the handling is horrible. I felt like I was rolling over everytime I turned at an intersection(this is coming from a guy that drives a 01 hyundai accent). I was also somewhat disapionted how plain everything looked on the inside. The car had good power but not as much as I expected and for the gas mileage it got its rather weak. I was a honda dealer 5 years ago and a honda with v-tec would be more powerful and economical than the cavalier but probably cost a little more too so I can't hold that against this car.

My daughter so far likes the car because of its sunroof mainly but she has had 2 problems with it so far well 3 if you count the headlight but that's really nothing. The first big problem was she said when you where going around sixty-five it would constantly shift in and out of overdrive and jerk. She quickly took it to the dealer and had it fixed, no problem. The other thing was it wouldn't start the day me and her went to branson. The dealer towed it for free but still it was troublesome. The ignition module had gone out. The dealers mechanic said if I was smart I would trade it off now! I thought he was probably just bias against chevrolet. My daughter still has the car and its running good but I am still a little worried about when the short 33,000 mile warranty is up.

I also don't mean to be bias but it will probably be my last chevrolet I buy. Those darn japanese and koreans just make them to well!! Thanks!
