            I originally bought my 1998 Kia Sephia because of the advertised price.  They said you could get a new car for under $10,000.  I was approaching a divorce and needed new car dependability with a monthly payment I could afford on a single income.  The salesman assured me that this was the car for me, after I explained my situation to him.  

Now, I am 47 years old and have bought many new cars in my lifetime, and I have NEVER...... I repeat NEVER EVER had the problems with ANY new car that I had with this Kia. First of all... by the time I got out of there, I had paid WAY over what they advertised for the car.  

From the moment I bought the car, I had troubles with starting.... the car would start fine one minute, and with the next turn of the key be totally &quot;dead&quot;.... not even a click!!!  For that, they replaced the starter, I believe.  

I had the steering column assembly replaced due to noisy steering.  

I had rotors replaced TWICE.. with &quot;new and improved&quot; rotors, due to multiple complaints by customers with same problems.  The first time, the rotors had warped after only a very short time...  then after the rotors were replaced, the brakes started squealing.  I took it back again and they replaced the brake pads with &quot;new and improved&quot; pads (again, I was not the first to have this problem).  

I've had the door lock on the driver's side replaced TWICE... each time because it would break in the locked position, forcing me to climb over the console and out the other side to enter or exit the vehicle.

I've had two recalls on the vehicle... for wiper blade assembly and ... I forget what the other one was.

I've had the rubber weather stripping between the car and the windows/doors falling off.

I've had the dome light replaced because it would not stay on or turn on when the door was opened. 

I've had the venting system replaced on the gas tank, because every time I tried to fill my tank, it would overflow all down the side of my car, yet the gauge would never show that I had a full tank.  

I've had it in twice because of car alarm malfunctions.  First because it would go off for no apparent reason... then because you could jump up and down on the car and it wouldn't go off.  Now you can even open the doors and it will not sound... some security!!!

I just a couple weeks ago had to have the battery replaced, as I went out and my car was totally dead.  The &quot;3-year&quot; battery was still under warranty, but was &quot;pro-rated&quot; as it was 2 years old, and so a new one cost me $75.  I was told that I either pay $75 for THEIR new battery, or pay them $35 just to look at it, and then still have to go out and buy a new battery and put it in myself.  Needless to say, I was stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I'm sure there is more that I had it in for.... those are just the ones that come to the top of my mind.

Now that the &quot;bugs&quot; are all worked out, it's not a bad driving car.  If you're looking for good pick-up, this is NOT the car for you.  It is doggy from a dead stop, but once you build speed, it does ok.  It does offer a fairly smooth ride for a cheap car... and the looks are pretty good.  

I am obviously not the first to have these problems.  I talked to another lady who's sister bought one.  She ended up getting a refund from the manufacturer on hers.  I wish I had been so lucky.  I am now stuck with a car that has such a low resale value that I can NEVER sell it for what I owe, so I am stuck. 

Bottom line, I would NOT recommend buying this car to ANYONE unless you have LOTS of time on your hands to be repeatedly inconvenienced by taking your car in or having it towed in to fix all the problems that WILL crop up.  The only thing worse than this car was the service and attitude at the dealership where I bought it.  Definitely a car-buying NIGHTMARE!!!!
