            A very popular car around these parts (make that everywhere in the US).  Especially with the younger crowd.  Which makes these cars ripe for car thieves.  And when they don't steal the whole car, than it's the emblems.

Aside from a few negatives: mainly the price/value relationship, lack of horsepower, and the aforementioned theft issue; this is a pretty nice car.  The doors close with a solid, not tinny, sound and the interior ergonomics are decent with the exception of what Honda calls "cupholders" (they are too small for my "cup" and they don't "hold").

In the end however, this is (and feels) like a very small a car.  Given the price premium, I'd go with a Toyota Corolla.  While the Toyota's styling leaves something to be desired, it has true bulletproof reliability.  More than one friend has told me a horror story or two about their Honda, especially the transmission problems.  But still, better than anything put out by GM, Ford, or D-C; by far.  And both the Corolla and the Civic are better than any other asian-based platform (i.e., Mazda Protege, any Hyundai, Daewoo, or Kia).  

Have never driven a Nissan so I don't know how the Sentra would compare though I do know this:  the Sentra is ugly and even tough it boasts the most horsepower of any economy car, it still feels sluggish in the midrange (trying to overtake cars on the freeway).  Also, Nissan is undergoing a change in personality as they do every ten years or so.  This will result in, among other things, a V8, $40,000 Maxima - that kinda tells you about the direction they're headed.
