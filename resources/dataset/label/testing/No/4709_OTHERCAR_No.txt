            *PLEASE NOTE* After owning this van for over a year I have had a chance to give a better review. 
As a Mother with 4 kids ages ranging from 3-14 I was sure this was THE van to have. There is a ton of leg room, as well as so many gadgets to make a busy driver's life easier. First it has the dual sliding doors. This is a life saver for our family in our old van (Plymouth voyager) the bigger kids were always tripping over each other and trying to crowd out the single sliding door at the same time. The dual doors allow everyone to exit the vehicle without smashing the little guy. The seating is very roomy and  everyone has their own vent for heating/ air conditioning. The AC/Heat is temperature adjustable. If the passenger is hot and wants the AC on, the driver can turn his AC temp off, and vise versa. The same works with the rear AC/heat.  The seats, (including the rear) all recline for long trips. The steering wheel even has a radio tuner built in, you don't even have to touch the radio! Most of the controls are in the center of the dash for easy access. The rear trunk has a backup warning beep to alert anyone standing too close when it is opening. (Great for kids, but can be quite annoying out in public) I use the back trunk remote opener a lot when my hands are full with grocery bags. There is also a remote sliding door opener.The automatic sliding doors are VERY convenient for those times where your too stressed to remember important things like shutting the doors before you take off :) AND Ladies ready for this part? MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS VAN!!! Unlike our Plymouth Voyager THIS van corners like a sports car! The standard stereo system sounds great too! This is THE most comfortable luxury van I have ever owned, and it looks sharp. I just wish it was not quite so pricey. Mini vans are notorious for brake problems. I was really hoping that wouldn't be the case in a luxury van. Unfortunately I have had the van in THREE TIMES in one year for Brake/ Rotor problems....sigh. I am not one to ride my brakes, so I am not sure why this is happening. Also, the turn signal motor had to be replaced. *UPDATE* Motor went out on Drivers side window, Air conditioning had to be re charged after a year  (I LIVE IN SEATTLE for crying out loud!) I AM TRADING IT IN FOR A GMC YUKON! Look for my review on the Yukon coming soon.
