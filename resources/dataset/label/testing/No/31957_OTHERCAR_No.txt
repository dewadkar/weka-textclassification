            I purchased the car new and held onto it for 11 months before trading up to a 300M. For those looking for a fast 4 door, this is not the answer. You may want to look elsewhere. THe 260 HP V8 just has a tough time pushing this 4400 lb beast down the road. The interior is of typical GM plastic and appears more like a Cavalier then a Cadillac. But power braking is easy to do in the car and can intimidate others into believing that the car is fast. Trunk space is massive and one gets the feeling of safety in such a large car. Styling is on the boring side with many people not knowing what a SS version is other than a comical emblem on the side of the car. Someone actually told me that. The car does it's job well as a highway tourer with a nice ride. The first 7 months were greeted with 5 visits to the dealer for warranty covered items. Not a very reliable car, but then it is a GM product and this is to be expected from GM.
