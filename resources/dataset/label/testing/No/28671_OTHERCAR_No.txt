            My dad bought me my red bodied, white topped, 1995 Chrysler LeBaron a couple of months before i received my license.  I was so excited! I don't think i really cared what type of car i got, i was extremely excited just to get a car. Let me start off by saying this: this car is not meant for a new driver. The blind spots are horrible! You have to look at least three places before you pass anyone (this includes looking all the way behind you just to make sure there isn't another car there) 

I've had problem after problem after breakdown after breakdown with this stupid car. Stupid Chryslers. I've had this baby stall on me when i was driving 60 mph on a highway. The only good thing is that when it stalls there is a bright orange light that comes on telling me that i need to "check engine". Great. The oil HAS to be changed at 3,000 miles or you can expect it to stall as well. Actually, it burns oil like no other, so sometimes you have to add more oil even before that mark. My awful white top needs to be replaced because it is stained with brown spots, and the lining is falling off. It looks horrible, but i'm getting a new car soon so i'm not really worried abou it. 

The car is fast, however. It can pull out in front of traffic and be going 60 mph before you know it. The V6 power it puts out is really good. It gets gas mileage like any V6, maybe even a little better. If you have this car and want it to go as fast as possible, i suggest putting premium gas in its tanks.  As I write this, (speaking of gas) my car sits in my driveway awaiting a new gas line or whatever. i started getting terrible gas mileage a few days a go and yesterday, when it rained, i notcied an egregious gas smell and a huge puddle surrounding my car. Awesome. It is just another problem that my dumb lebaron has had me deal with. If i knew exactly everything that was changed with my car i would tell you, but my dad does all the repairs. (he owns an auto-body shop) I know that the gas filter or whatever was changed, along with, what i would say, about 7 things. This is all in the course of a year. The car has left me stranded three times (as to the point where i had to get a tow truck). I had to have the small window on the driver's side replaced (the motor died) and the car still leaks when it rains. Yes, i get wet and my seat gets wet. 

Pretty much I'm telling you that you should have your LeBaron highly inspected before you even consider buying one. Considering the research i did on my car, everyone has the same problems with their lebarons as well. Chryslers just suck! And if you feel the need to buy one, stay away from LeBarons.
