            We previously had a Lexus ES300. It was a nice car. Nothing special, just a nice car. We made some big bucks in the stock market, so among other things, we bought a boat. Nothing big, a nice 22 foot Searay...about 3000 lbs. So we needed a truck or something to tow this boat. After doing much research, we knew that the RX300 wasn't the best for the $$$, but man, my mother fell in love with it in the showroom. She wasn't too fond of the Infinti QX4's rugged look, and preferred the more &quot;feminine&quot; RX300. Our main concern was the towing capability of the car. After the salesperson at Lexus of Kendall assured us that teh RX would be able to tow anything under 3500 pounds, we felt confident in our purchase.

Then came the challenge.

After our first boat outing, the RX300 struggled to get the boat out of the water. We felt quite pathetic as the RX300's Goodyears burnt rubber, and finally was able to draw the boat out of the boatramp. Well, we were quite upset with this, and complained to the dealership. They really didn't give a ****. The experience with the dealership was upsetting. We were treated as  anumber, and heck, with the RX outselling the ES at the dealership 10:1, I can see why. After the great experience I had by replacing my Infiniti J30's goodyears with Firestones, I decided to do the same with the RX300. And it worked. The RX, while still in need of some more power, no longer burns rubber or slips on the boatramp. LEXUS...you should provide the RX300 with gripping tires on a SUV, not the passenger tires used on the ES300, just a bigger size. We are sure with the QX4's 5000 towing capacity and additional horsepower and torque, the QX4 would've been a better hauler. It feels like we are dragging a huge block of concrete with no wheels when we are towing the boat. I should comment though that the ABS brakes work very very very well even with all of the weight it has to stop with the boat. The Lexus did a fine job of stopping in a couple of emergency situations where people showed us why Miami ahs the most crazy drivers in the US.

The RX300 has an amazing ride. Very soft, traditional Lexus. Even when we take the RX300 to some out of city off-road situations, the RX shows why it carries a Lexus logo on it. The interior is quite spacious for the size of the SUV, which really isn't that big. While the dash is nice, and the way the gear changer is placed wows many, it does create discomfort when my long legs lean against the side of it. The stereo system is nice, nothing amazing though. Wind noise is awful, and Lexus knows it, because when the automatic sunroof opener is activated, the sunroof will only open 3/4, a full opening will create some downright annoying windnoise. The windshield wipers can't keep up in massive rainstorms. The leather is nice though, and the interior design of the car is very nice. Lots of convenient places to put things, and the cupholders work very well. We have had some problems with the car's electrical system. The tailights continued to short on a number of occasions...after several visits tot eh Lexus dealer, the finally got it right.

In conclusion, while the RX300 struggles when towing large items, it makes up for it in ergonomics, comfort, and interior design. If you already drive an older Lexus, the loyalty program can get you into one of these for almost invoice. People that post on the board giving this vehicle one star are jealous they don't have one of these head-turners, because while the RX300 isn't exceptional, it is a  good vehicle.<br><br>
