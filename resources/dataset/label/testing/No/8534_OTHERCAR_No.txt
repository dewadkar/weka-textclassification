            Just wanted to point out something to people considering the Sebring. I have a 1998 Sebring LXi, and I love it for the most part, but I'm having a few problems.

First: I've had four flat tires in the 18 months that I've owned the car. When I get them repaired the dealer ALWAYS tells me there is nothing wrong with the tire. It appears that they just go flat. I guess it is because they are low profile tires and don't hold the air pressure real well. If the air pressure gets a little low then the just loose the seal (my opinion). So you need to MAKE SURE you always monitor your air pressure.

Second: The exterior panels on the bottom of the doors are only held on at the bottom by these little plastic clips. Occasionally when I open one of my doors the bottom door panel hooks on the front corner panel and pops all of the clips out. I have to take the panel, line the pins up again, and reinsert them. It is really a pain!

In fact I'm so annoyed by these things that I'm looking for a new SUV now!<br><br>
