            I presently own a 1993 Mercury Cougar XR-7.  I have driven this car until the wheels have practically fallen off of the vehicle.  I bought the car in January 1996 for $12,000 cash when my awesome white Ford Probe was totaled in a wreck.  My cougar was just a baby when I bought it and had only 36,000 miles on it.  It was in great condition.  To date I have put almost 100,000 miles on my vehicle in just 4 years.  The odometer reads 131,453 miles.  It is amazing I am still driving it.

My cougar is jet black, with limo tint, and a kick azz stereo system.  I do have to say that it is not very often that a WOMAN has a better stereo system than most guys in her area.  I am proud to say that I excel in that area!  Anyways back to my car...The interior is awesome.  It is equipped with leather seats, wood grain dashboard, premium sound system, V6 engine, automatic, sunroof, and all my buttons are automatic.  I have to say this car has been a great asset to me since I have always been a big flirter!  I definitely turn heads in this car when I am out and about.

The car was virtually maintenance free for the first two years I owned it with the exception of having to put new breaks on every year.  The Mercury Cougars have had the bad brake problem for awhile and I don't know if they have fixed the problem with the new 1999's or not.  It has been a pain though to constantly worry about the brakes.  The last 7 months or so I have had nothing but trouble out of my car.  It has been the battery going bad after only a month, to the whole system just shutting down.  The last month every now and then when I come to a complete stop it will just die.  The dealerships have looked at it and can find nothing wrong.  They have actually told me I was crazy that I imagined the whole thing.  I think my boyfriend even thought I was crazy until it happened to us last week when he was driving us to my grandparent's house.

The gas mileage is pretty good.  It will get approximately 20C/26H.  My car has been to hell and back on trips upon trips.  But all in all I guess I have gotten my money's worth.  But I do not think it is like fine wine and only gets better with age...  <br><br>
