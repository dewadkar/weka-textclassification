            We have 7800 miles on our 2000 Tahoe, have had brake failure 3 times and the transmission is irregular in its shifting pattern. Our brakes fail when coming to a slow controlled stop for approximately 3 to 4 seconds with no warning. The transmission among many of its problems, will sometimes feel like it has slipped into neutral and you have no power then all of a sudden will kick into gear and has at times felt like the car behind you had hit you. We have been to 3 dealers who won't believe there is a problem unless we can force it to duplicate in their presence, spent hours on phone calls with Chevrolet, written Chevrolet, contacted the BBB Auto division and reported it to NHSTA. So far, our response from Chevrolet has been there is no problem until we prove there is and they refuse to investigate. We have a friend with a 2000 Suburban who is having the exact same problem, and we had a loaner Suburban for a week that also had brake failure. We feel that all of our problems are related, and think that the culprit is the computer. I wish someone out there could advise us on what to do, we no longer feel safe in this vehicle and are forced to use it or dump it on some unsuspecting person. How can Chevrolet be so unresponsive and uncaring, in light of all that had happened with Ford and Firestone? 

Has anyone else had these problems?<br><br>
