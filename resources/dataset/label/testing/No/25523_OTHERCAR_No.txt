            I loved my 1990 B2200 truck, extended cab, so when it reached 132,000 early in 1999, I started looking for a replacement so I could give it to my daughter as her first.

I looked at all others but came back to Mazda, even though Ford bought them, I thought they couldn't have messed it up that badly.

I was wrong,  I am not enchanted with it as I was my 1990.

My B3000 Troy Lee is pretty, lots of compliments on it but NO get-up in 6 cyl, transmission changes gears roughly, and squeaks and creaks already, at less than 5500 miles and 6 months old.

I got a good deal, less than $17,000 end of year, and I LOVE the four doors,  but I will not buy Mazda again unless they take the reins.

Ford spends too much time hawking their own ranger and not keeping the trust built by Mazda to keep its customers.<br><br>
