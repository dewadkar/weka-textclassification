            I had a rental Taurus a few weeks ago.  I had reserved a Ranger Pickup, but the company didn't have any in, so they gave me a new Taurus.  I thought I was getting a deal, but I sure was wrong.  Ironically, the rental agent said to me, &quot;I'm giving you a new Taurus, since you have the two babies, I wouldn't want a car to break down on you.&quot;  An omen?

The car was fine for the first few days, save the awkward placement of the controls and the layout of the interior in general that one comes to expect with most American nameplate autos.

It wasn't until a rainy afternoon when the car left my wife sit at some train station outside Boston.  Wouldn't start, wouldn't turn over, totally dead.  The tow truck driver, whom I got to spend about three and a half hours of quality time with as we made our way to the rental car facility at Logan airport, suspected the car failed because it was &quot;wet.&quot;

I've never liked Fords, and I used to own one that was an absolute piece of junk.  Needless to say, this Taurus hasn't changed my opinion.

So for your own sake, don't buy this car.  Test drive a nice Honda, Nissan, VW, or Toyota.  Sure they cost more, but you can drive them when its raining.<br><br>
