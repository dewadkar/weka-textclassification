            The car that is appealing for it's cute bubble-y looks isn't so engine appealing we have discovered.  My fiancee owns a 1996 Dodge neon and for the past two years it has been nothing but trouble and we should have purchased a new car for all the money we've sunk into repairs. 

What's appealing about the neon right off the bat is it's price.  It is a very inexpensive car with good mileage and lots of room.  It looks great driving down the road and at the time it was purchased, I was under the assumption that Dodge took excellent care of it's customers.

These past couple of years have been miserable!  We have discovered that many neons have  had defects with their head gaskets which has been the on and off problem with our neon.  When we first shelled out 2000 to replace the head and gasket, we did not realize it was a defect until we had to do it again A YEAR LATER.  We decided we really needed to do some researce.

We took our findings back to the dealer and were told that it was not a defect and that we were having problems because there were too many miles on the car. (86,000).  We sent letters and protested more because frankly, sinking 4000 into a 5 year old car with 86,000 miles just didn't make sense to us at all.

Finally, this past week we were given our reimbursement.  A whole 470 dollars.  We will continue to work out this matter but my advice to you is if you buy a neon, get the head and head gasket checked out immediately!
