            In 1998 I bought a 1995 Pontiac Trans Sport. I was thinking about buying a new mini-van, but the $20,000 price tags didn't sit well with me. Dodge was asking top dollar for their mini-van and I knew 5 owners of older Dodge mini-vans. 3 of 5 had said they were happy that they bought their Dodge mini-van, but after talking in depth with them I found a laundry list of little problems. Most of the problems were related to fit and finish. They had window seals that didn't seal well, dashes that rattled, and knobs that look worn after only a year. 

I still took a 98 Dodge for a test drive. It did drive well. The wind noise was average and the engine wasn't too loud. Dodge was the only Van at the time with the duel rear sliding doors. After driving the Dodge I took a Toyota and then Ford mini-van for a test drive. The Ford would of been the one I would of gone with, but the over $20,000 price tag just seemed high. 

I saw an ad for 1995 Trans Sport in the paper and it was priced at only $12,000. I knew that when this generation of GM min-van came out they had some issues. Some of it was because of the plastic body parts. They called the GM Mini-vans &quot;Plastic Fantastics&quot;. I had a body shop guy claim you to buy special tools just to repair these. I don't know if that is true or not and I hope to never find out. 

I ran over to the nearest GM dealer to drive one of their min-vans. It was an Olds dealer. The Olds Silhouette, Chevy Lumina Mini-van, and Pontiac Trans Sport are clones of each other. The test drive went well. The giant dash takes some getting use too. You don't really see any of the nose when driving. Cleaning the inside of the front windshield is a pain. 

The feature that made the Gm min-vans nice were the remote side rear power sliding door, strong V-6 engine, and easy to remove back seats. Not having a large single bench seat to remove for cargo space was really nice. These seats are small enough that my wife can take them in and out. Those same small seats do have a draw back and that is comfort. If you are use to the tall wide seats then you will not like these. These seats feel like they were built for kids and short drives. Not a big deal for since I didn't carry more then 1 other person most of the time. The rear seats get used about 5% of the time. I got a van for my garage sale trips. Having all that covered cargo space is nice. 

I have been behind the wheel for over 2 years and 45,000 miles. So far no major problems, but it has had a couple of minor ones. The first was the rear door light sensor would not always turn off the rear interior light. That little light would run my battery down if I let it sit to long. The other problem I had was with a sensor going bad. The sensor caused my engine to cut out. The weather striping around the passenger and driver doors is weaker than it was, so now I hear more wind noise then in the past. 

The Trans Sport doesn't drive as well as the Ford Windstar or Dodge, but it is been good. Breaking distance is average for min-vans in up to 1998. I haven't noticed any excessive tire wear. I drive to Tahoe in the winter and find that the Trans Port can handle the snow well. The V-6 gives me good passing power. If I do highway driving and don't lead foot it, I can get above 20 miles to the gallon. 

It would be nice to roll down rear side windows like the new 2001 Mazda. The little vent latches really don't do a very good job. The AC takes a while to cool the entire van down. It seems like GM made sure the driver was comfortable and cut corners with the back seat passengers in 1995. If you plan on long family trips don't buy this van. My friends Windstar seemed much better than the Trans Sport. I may of saved thousands of dollars, but I try to keep my cars 10 years or more. I think I would of rather of waited for a slightly used Windstar to hit the market rather then buying this Trans Sport. 

Bottom line here is if you are just looking for a mini-van to haul things in, the Trans Sport is worth looking at. Thanks to their so-so following they don't cost that much. The Dodge seems over rated, but it still a worth looking at. I drove a Toyota Previa at my former employer and found the fit and finish was great, but the Previa was a slug. Seats were a pain to pull out and put back in as well. You will pay more for Dodge, Ford, or Toyota mini-van, but it might be worth it if plan to keep it for a while.
