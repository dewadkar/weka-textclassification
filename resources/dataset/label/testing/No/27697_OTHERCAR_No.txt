            When I first saw the Eclipse I was in love. A beautiful car, The outside is amazing. Nice contour and a smooth body. The inside was extremely comfortable in the front. Seats were good enough to sit in for hours. The back was a bit cramped but it was ok cause it's the driver I worry about =]. Driving the car is also great, smooth ride, fast, and fun to pull up to people in a nice car. SO why you ask not to buy it. One big problem, the car bottoms out like crazy. Entering a driveway u scratch the bottom, sometimes on a bump. It's ridiculous how much trouble you can get. I leased one and when it came time to return it, I had to pay 3000$+ in damages to fix what the bottoming out did. In the long run, I think you'd be better off with a nice acura integra.
