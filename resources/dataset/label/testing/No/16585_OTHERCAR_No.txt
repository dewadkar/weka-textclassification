            I've owned my MPV for about six months now, and I've been pretty dissappointed with my purchase.  I bought the MPV because it was one of the most affordable mini-vans on the market, but now I wish that I had spent the extra money for a higher quality vehicle.

I have not experienced any major mechanicle problems with my van so far, but I have had some minor problems.  The windshield had a leak which created a whistling noise whenever I went over 60 MPH.  That has been fixed.  The panelling on the back has begun to seperate.  That has not been fixed yet and rattles quite a bit.

The mileage on the sticker was very optomistic.  It said 18 miles to the gallon for city driving and 23 for highway.  I've found that 17 in city and 19 on highway are much more accurate.  The gas tank also seems smaller than the 18.5 that is in the user manual.  I ran out of gas the other day and didn't even get 17 gallons in before the pump stopped pumping.

The seats in the MPV are not as comfortable as other vehicles I have owned, most recently the Nissan Sentra.  The arm rests and head rests lack any padding.  The front seats are very flat and allow you to slide around when turning.

The air conditioning is one of the weakest parts of the vehicle.  I purchased the rear AC, which works alright.  But to my surprise, getting rear heat is an entirely different option that didn't come with my vehicle.  How these vents can pump cold are but not hot is beyond me.  The front vents blow very weak and are rather noisy on the highest setting.

The engine packs a decent amount of power, but the automatic transmission takes a little while to warm up before shifting smoothly.  It can be pretty jerky for the first five minutes.

There are two things I like about this van.  First, the sliding door windows roll down.  Second the rear seat can fold down so it doesn't have to be taken out to load extra cargo.
