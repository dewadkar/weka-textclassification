            I own a 2000 LSE Rodeo. It has been full of all kinds of problems. To name a few:
1- Extensive Vibration/Shaking while driving
2- Noisy/Rough Transmission
3- Check Engine Light coming on for no particular reason
4- Clicks/Clacks all over the interior
5- Significant body roll due to Intelligent Suspension Control?
6- The worst customer service you can think of..

This truck has less than 5k miles on it and it has been to the dealership numerous times to get some of the above mentioned problems fixed but it still shakes extensively and the transmission is still very noisy/rough. The dealership do agree that the shaking and transmission noise is not normal but they have not been able to find the cause and fix it. Currently we are waiting for Isuzu to advise further. It is sad that I spent almost $30,000 on such a sub-standard product. 
My sincere advice, &quot;Don't buy this truck&quot; <br><br>
