            My review is about the new 2000 Cadillac DeVille, in my opinion it is one of the best luxury cars on the market today for the money. For a 2000 Coupe DeVille you are looking to spend between $35-40,000 depending on the options you want. But even fully loaded with all the options possible it is still cheaper then a 2000 lexus LS400, or a BMW, or any 2000 Mercadies Benz. I have owned both lexus' and BMW's and in my opinion my cadillac out performs them all and to top it all off its cheaper! But like everything there are some down points, the vehicle has a high deft rate witch means this type of car is a good target for car theifs, also if you did not buy the sedan or any Cadillac STS you will not be getting good MPG were talking, streets 16 highway 22. Also the only other thing I do not like is the plastic rear bumper, for a car with all the options that it has you'd think GM would put a better bumper on the thing, but thats just the way it is. I have been a Cadillac owner for a long time now, my first car was a 1985 Coupe DeVille, which is probably the reason I bought the Coupe DeVille this year, but I have always been impressed by there performance, and maybe after reading this you will buy one and be impressed too.. thanks for reading.<br><br>
