            Our families have always bought Ford cars and trucks.  We have always been treated good until now.  My husband and I love this car.  We bought this car in October 1999.  However, after having the car for a month we were in a car accident.  We took the car to be repaired in Dec. 1999.  Ten weeks after turning in the car in for repair, Ford is still not releasing the parts to repair the car.  How can they sell a brand new car but not have the parts available to repair it?  This makes no sense to me. We will never buy another FORD again especially after the way we have been treated.  Poor customer service!!!!<br><br>
