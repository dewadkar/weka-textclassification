            I purchased a 1995 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE in July 1995. I have loved driving this van and love the Quad seats in the back.  The van has a comfortable ride and is great for trips and hauling small things.  I wish the seated let down flat for hauling.  I find removing the seats very difficult without a man to help.

Chrysler's service is something else.  I had minor problems the first year, such as unexplained noises.  They really tried to fix them, but it required several trips to the dealership before they found the problem.

My first major problem was at the 50,000 mile service.  The local Dodge dealership replaced the antifreeze and flushed the radiator.  The bill for this service was about $700.  When I went to pick up the van they told me the radiator drain was damaged when they drained the radiator. They said they needed to replace the radiator as this plastic drain could not be replaced or repaired.  They said it would hold for a while.  

After a good argument, to no avail, I told them to replace the drain and I left.  Needless to say a couple of months later, the radiator drain failed and my engine overheated and I was stranded.  I called a local mechanic I trusted and he replaced my radiator.  He told me he never drained the radiator with the defective drain plug as it usually damaged it.  You would think the Chrysler product dealerships would know this also.  I paid for the new radiator and did not complain to Chrysler.

My can now has 62,000 miles.  For a couple of months the transmission has hesitated in the morning when I put the car in reverse.  It is now getting much worse and takes 30 sec. or more to go in reverse.  The transmission is now beginning to have trouble shifting at 50 mph.
I have checked around and have been told that the transmission should be replaced at a cost of $1500 - 1800.  My problem now is - Do I put this much money back into this vehicle or get rid of it ASAP.

A friend who is an Avon rep. was stranded in her Plymouth van 2 years ago when her transmission failed.  She told me 8 of the reps. had transmission problems that year.  When I think about it, I now remember seeing numerous Plymouth and Dodge vans on the side of the interstate (transmission problems I presume.)

This will be my last purchase of a Chrysler product.  I'm going back to Honda or Toyota.  I have a Honda Accord with 165,000 miles
 
I would like to know where to make a formal complaint to Plymouth.
