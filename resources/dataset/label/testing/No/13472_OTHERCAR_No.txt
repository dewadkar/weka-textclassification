            Ugh... In between the (temporary) death of my '87 Buick Skyhawk Turbo and the purchasing of my '84 BMW 318i was a span of about 2.5 months.  I had a job in a bakery in Hastings, NE (30 miles away) during this period, and I needed a way to get to work.

So I was given this wonderous opportunity to experience the marvelous automotive tour de force that is known as the Geo Metro during this span of time.

Please note I am employing sarcasm.

Yeah, my brother had just turned 15 and my parents got this car FOR FREE from my uncle.  Yessir, it cost NOTHING.  "A good car to learn to drive in.", they said.

Right.

This car is actually a cheaper Suzuki Swift, by the way. 

The car is white and has "METRO" decals on the front doors, just like 75% of all the Metros that exist.  Unlike most Metros, it's the no name middle model, not the even cheaper XFi 2 door or the more "luxurious" LSi model.  The exterior is nondescript, but it has the cuteness inherent to all tiny cars.

The car had about 150,000 miles when we got it.  I put about 5,000 over the course of the summer.

The interior is cream colored and CHEAP.  Really CHEAP. Plastic everywhere.  Seats are hard and shapeless.  EVERYTHING RATTLES.  THE EXHAUST DRONES.  THE TIRES ROAR.  Of all the things I despise about this car, the noise was the biggest one.  At just 30 miles an hour, the wind is already roaring around the front pillars.  Insulation is nonexistant.  I don't think this car could possibly be any louder.  I worked 12 hours shifts at the bakery, and I'd drive home at 5 in morning.  And I'd have to suffer the 50 minute drive back home in this horribly loud clunker.  UGH!!!  Considering how small the car is, the space front and back is really pretty decent.  There's even enough space in the rear hatch between the wheelwells for a dual 10" sub box, but that would make the car rattle even more!

How's it drive?  SLOWLY.  Engine?  What engine?  Oh, that thing under the hood?  Not really an engine in my mind.  ONE LITER, 61 CUBIC INCHES, 3 CYLINDERS.  Sorry folks, but this kind of minimalist powerplant just doesn't cut it in America.  55 horsepower @ 5700 rpm and 58 lb-ft of torque @ 3300 rpm is in no way adequate for moving a car, especially on the highway.  Remember, those are PEAK figures, so most of the time you have 20, 25, 30 horsepower.  JEEZ!

Rice rocketeers would die for the ripping, nasal exhaust note that eminates from the tailpipe!

Sure, the car only weighs 1693 pounds, but the power-to-weight ratio is absolutely atrocious.  A Ford Excursion has a better power to weight ratio.  To rub salt in the wound, this thing has a 3 speed automatic.  We're talking an honest-to-goodness 20 seconds for 0-60.  You're absolutely guarenteed to have the slowest vehicle on the road when you drive a Metro.  I did everything possible to prevent having to come to a complete stop while driving this car so I wouldn't become a virtual roadblock to ever other vehicle on the highway.

THIS THING IS SO SLOW IT'S ACTUALLY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF THE SPEED DIFFERENTIAL THAT EXISTS BETWEEN IT AND EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE ROAD.

Passing?  Heh heh heh.  Don't even entertain such foolish ideas.  This car is going flat out at 65 mph, and 60 mph is the max if you have the A/C on.  I would never dream of driving it on the Interstate.  It can't mantain speed going uphill without flooring the pedal.

The A/C works wonderfully!  Blows ice cold in seconds.  But the car becomes even slower when you turn it on, as though a 300 pound weigh had just been dropped in the back seat.  Seriously!  The engine acts just like a balloon having some of the air let out of it when you turn on the A/C.  Lesson: use the A/C in town or when at cruising speed ONLY.

No cruise meant my leg got tired all the time.  I admit it: I drove the car with my left foot sometimes to reduce fatigue.  Sorry, but I think all cars sold here should have cruise control.  There's nothing "sporty" about rigidly holding your foot in the same position for several hours.

The engine leaked exhaust and oil at an absolutely incredible rate at first.  My father spent $400 to fix the leaks, to little avail.  Exhaust fumes are drawn in via the rear hatch, and the engine BURNED EVERY DROP OF OIL YOU PUT IN IT.  I'm serious.  The car virtually ran without oil the entire time I drove it.  Heck, I even forgot to put the oil filler cap back on the engine TWICE while I had the car because I was adding oil everyday and I'm practically tripping from doing nothing but working and sleeping and driving.  I drove the car at 55 mph for 30 miles WITH NO OIL CAP ON.  Oil is spouting out of the engine, covering everything under the hood.  And it drives normally.  I get home, and the car looks like it has a nosebleed, oil pouring down the nose.  But the engine was fine.  The oil light didn't even come on!  This car seriously can run with zero oil.  I know that sounds dumb, but it's basically true!  Any oil put in the car becomes black instantly... I'm sure it's because the seal between the piston and cylinder wall is not existant, meaning it burns both oil and gas in the combustion chambers.

(October Update) My dad has just informed me that the rings on the engine are so worn out that the pressure leaking out of the combustion chamber is great enough to blow out the O-ring on the end of the cam, causing the blackened non-present oil to spurt out the top of the engine!  That's crazy, folks!

Despite all this, the car got me to work everyday.  Never had trouble with starting or driving it.  I guess I'm just too much of a gearhead to be comfortable driving a car with no oil, even if drives normally.  It just doesn't seem logical to me that a car can work in such a way.  And yet the Metro does!  I averaged the 1 star of how it appears to run (shouldn't run at all!), and the 5 stars of how it actually runs (all the time) to get 3 stars overall.

Call me cynical.....

The ride is decent, very buttoned down to the road.  Far from sporty, but more communicative than most cars.  It gets quite harsh over bumps, but it's not terrible.  Crosswind stability is pretty good. Big rigs blowing by me didn't send the car flying off the road.  The tiny 145/80R12 tires made an incredible amount of noise, but offered decent traction for the tiny amount of power available.  No power steering, but that's only noticable in a parking lot.  The unassisted steering is also pretty decent.  You can buy new tires this size for $12 each!  The car does alright in urban traffic.  Just hit the gas pedal!

Gas mileage is good, but not great.  38 in town, 46 on the highway.  The economy would be better if the car was a manual and the engine wasn't totally messed up.

This car cost $3 MORE a month for my insurance than my Skyhawk!  Huh!?!  It has 1/3 the horsepower!  Never did figure that one out.....

Let's just say you really, REALLY wouldn't want to get hit driving in this thing.  1693 pounds?  A normal midsize car weighs about 3400 pounds.  An normal SUV or truck weighs about 5000 pounds.  A Ford Excursion with 4WD and the 7.3L turbodiesel V8 weighs nearly 8000 pounds EMPTY.  This car is a VIRTUAL DEATH TRAP IN A COLLISION.  Remember the momentum formula?  Mass times velocity squared equals momentum.  Well, other vehicles have way more momentum in an accident because they weigh way more, and the Metro is basically gonna get squished by the abundance of force being levied again in a collision.

The brakes are average overall.  Low weight is main reason for the decent stopping distances.

I almost got hit by a semi driver who didn't brake early enough at a light on the highway.  He had to swerve into the other lane and his tire locked, sending him skidding nearly sideways through the intersection.  Thankfully, he had no trailer.  If he had hit me, I am sure I would not be here to write this.  As I saw him come up behind me, I had a vision of the car crumpling and the hulking wreckage being punted 200 feet down the road.

After that, I never stopped hard for a yellow when a semi was behind me.  Good advice in any car, but especially this one.

THIS CAR IS HONESTLY NOT SAFE TO DRIVE IN.

In summation, I used this car because I had to, but I would NEVER, NEVER drive one of my free will, and I would NEVER, NEVER let my children learn to drive in one.

If you own a Metro, please understand I'm not knocking you.  But the honest truth is it's the absolute bottom of the food chain.

Find a better way to get from Point A to Point B, folks!
