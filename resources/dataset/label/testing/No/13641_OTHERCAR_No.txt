            I had been looking for an SUV to support my business and my need to reach clients in inclement weather in New England.  I traded in a wonderful Honda Civic, but needed the extra room, and found the Kia, &quot;a fitting&quot; choice.  In the first month of owning the vehicle, it spent more time at the dealers garage, then I did driving it.  It has a lot of &quot;character&quot; (flaws) that is.  The first week I owned the car, I took a trip, and the car broke down on the turnpike.  All the belts had broken!!!

I own a two tone model, and the trim has fallen off.  The car is very noisy with the windows up and down.  I installed a wind screen to alleviate some of the noise, and it is just as bad.  There was an misalignment problem of the rear hatch which would intermittantly set off the security device.  The windows failed after the first three months to lower, and the inside door handles broke off.  
I continue to have the car in the shop for knocks, pings and squeals.  I have replaced two tires for slow leaks, and have had two new cd players installed in the car for overheating problems.  
The rear hatch is inconvenient to open, and leaves the car vulnerable to would be attackers.  
At best, the car has a cute appearance, and is a poor purchase for any price.<br><br>
