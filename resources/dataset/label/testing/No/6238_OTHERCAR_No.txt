            I purchased my 2001 Nissan Frontier XE King Cab 4x4 in October of 2000.  I had actually looked at a 2000 of the same type several months previous, but just couldn't get the deal I wanted.

I had spent the previous 5 years driving a 1995 Jeep Cherokee 4x4 with the 4.0 engine.  When I got in my Frontier for the first time, I immediately noticed that it was down on power compared to the Jeep.  The Jeep, however, was so agile and quick that I chalked it up to the Jeep being that great rather than the Nissan being that bad.

Anyway, I do feel like the truck is solid overall.  I think the build quality and overall feel of the truck are pretty good.  I have experienced some detonation when running 87 octane fuel however.  Neither the dealer nor the manual warns that you have to buy 89 or up octane gas.  This really becomes an issue if you, like me, commute 42 miles each way and are currently paying over $1.60 per gallon for 89 grade gas.

I am also disappointed with the comfort of the truck.  When my wife and I drove it originally, the salesman was poured into a tiny jumpseat behind us. Because of that, I was cramped at the wheel.  I mistook my discomfort to be because he was back there.  I have since found that I have a hard time finding something to do with my left foot, as there is no rest and the firewall/floor is at a rather steep angle.  Therefore, my left ankle frequently is stiff and sore.

Another potential issue with me is the power output.  I understand this is a small truck and NOT a rocket ship, but frankly still find just keeping up with traffic to be a hassle.  The truck is really winding on the highway (I have v6 + 5-speed) and is well over 3000 rpms at 75 mph.  When you live near a city, 75 mph+ is the PREVAILING speed.

Combined with the lack of power is poor fuel economy.  Driven at a constant 60 miles per hour with no aggressive driving, my truck delivered a best of 17.6 mpg.  If I remember correctly it was rated at 19 highway by Nissan.  I added an aftermarket bedcover and have enjoyed a 1 mpg improvement as a result.  I'm not expecting 30...but I was hoping for roughly 20.

On the note of styling, I do really like the looks of the truck.  That in fact is what made me look at it again.  I cannot drive the truck anywhere that somebody doesn't ask me about it.  Unfortunately that doesn't make up for it's shortcomings.

I am likely to sell this truck soon.  I got a good deal at about $19,500 out the door on it, but overall just don't find it to be a pleasant commuter/daily driver.  I have used it in incliment weather several times and found it to handle it GREAT.  The 4wd works well (although it grinds going into 4 wheel high while the truck is moving even under 5 mph) and delivers excellent traction.

Thinking of a small truck?  I would recommend looking at a Ranger instead (I had a 94 king cab which outclassed this Nissan in every respect).  The price is a tad higher but Ford always has plenty of rebates.
