            We purchased a 1999 Toyota Corolla about April of 1999 and it has been a very dependable car.  I personally don't like the color options for the interior of the car, but that's just because I go for the darker colors.

The car has had no major problems at all, which is a good thing since their service that we have received from Toyota however, has been far from great.  Because we purchased the car in Texas and drove the car to Boston, we are in a different &quot;zone&quot;.  Which means:

**  If your remote control breaks (which ours has done twice) they don't have to fix it.  &quot;You will have to take it back to Texas for that&quot;

We also had problems with very loud squeaking and rattling in the car.  Which of course they couldn't hear or fix.  (Our family and friends must just have a very acute sense of hearing)

The only reason I am not recommending this car to any of my friends and family is because I place a high importance on the respect and service I receive from a car manufacturer.
