            I had recently received a Ricoh DC-4, which is the Japanese equivalent to the RDC-4300. After opening the case, I was impressed with the neat little swiveling lens, and the crisp LCD. However, that's all I was impressed with. This camera just isn't worth spending your money on, period. (Thank god I got it as a gift). Battery life is atrocious, as I was only able to squeeze about 15 pictures out before the batteries died, or rather, dropped below the voltage required by the camera to take pictures. These are FRESH batteries, mind you, that I had just put into the camera only 20 minutes beforehand. 
     
Another downside to this camera is not having an optical viewfinder to take pictures with. Instead, the battery-sucking LCD is on ALL THE TIME, which drains your batteries faster than you can think. Again, usable battery life is only about 15 pictures on a set of batteries. Plus, if you decide on using the flash, the LCD turns off while the flash charges, which takes about 5 seconds or so, after which the LCD fires back up. 

I then tried my hand at the zoom feature of the camera, and almost cried, as the zoom motor struggled, clicked, and made other sorts of ungodly noises while attempting to zoom in on the subject. It also took about 15-20 seconds to go from the minimum to maximum zoom. All this, and I haven't even started on the picture quality yet...

Picture quality isn't so hot... The shutter speed is quite slow, and any type of movement on the subject or the photographer's part will result in a blurry image. I just bought an Olympus D340-R, which has the same resolution as the RDC-4300, and the pictures are 10 times better. (See my review). The LCD works nicely and sets the pictures up well. However, you'll have to do it pretty quickly if you want any decent battery life out of the camera.

The audio capture feature is pretty neat, but come on, you buy a digital camera to take good digital pictures, not record sound. If you want something like that, buy a camcorder. 

Obviously, I wasn't very impressed with this camera, as would anyone else who tries their hand at this camera. The higher end Ricoh cameras have gotten really good reviews, but at this price level, this camera doesn't have the features to make it compete with comparably featured cameras at the same price.<br><br>
