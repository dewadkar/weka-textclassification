            My month old 2000 Catera rides and drives great.  Alas, I can't really show it off!! Whenever I turn the heater on, or the electronic climate control (ECC) tries to add a little heat to the air, a strong burning smell comes through the air conditioning grills. 

The dealer can't solve the problem.  At first they said that the smell is due to Cosmoline added foe shipping and will burn off and the smell will go away.  I have driven 1100 miles, over 4 weeks.  The smell is bad as ever. Now, the foreman says he can't smell anything.  

In the mean time, no one, not even my wife, will ride in my brand new Catera.  They do not want to be choked with the bad smell.  This bad smell problem occurs only when there is some level warm air is added to the conditioned air.  There is no smell problem at all when only cold air is blowing.  Has any one experienced this problem with new 2000 model Cateras?  My dealer says Cadillac has no record of this problem in their database.  Please help!  I am really unhappy with the smell.
