            Unfortunately, as a women, I found this vehicle to be both bulky and often times clumsy in it's handling.  The step up in this SU is too high for anyone under 5'8&quot; or so tall.  I am 5ft and had to literally &quot;jump&quot; into the truck every time I wanted to drive.  I did, however, enjoy it on the weekends.  I would drive it on the dunes at the beach, and it was great.  This vehicle should be sold for what it is and not as a standard everyday SU.  It is a weekender at best.  It does not do well in city driving.  As far as repairs, the car had several recalls, and was in the dealership more often than it was in my garage.  I had a terrible time with Jeep wanting to freely repair things that had been recalled.  I would take the Jeep in complaining of something and they would not tell me that it was recall work.  I would have to find out myself what was recalled, let them know that I knew, and then they would admit it and do the work for free.  I never received any notices of any recalls.  I had to do the research on the net.  Very poor customer relations.    <br><br>
