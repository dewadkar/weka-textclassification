<TEXT>
              Last year we bought a 2000 Kia Sportage and I wrote an opinion on it.  Well, since it has been a year, I decided to update my opinion.  

  We were under the illusion that we had a nice vehicle, until things started going wrong.  First the radio started acting up with wiring problems.  The speakers would cut out.  Next, the airbag light lit up.  But it doesn't stay on constantly.  It flash on and off periodically.  Just recently had my brakes totally replaced.  In less than a year at about 25,000 miles my brakes were shot.  One last thing, there is a noise that it makes that I can't describe.  It usually does it when it is cold, but it is very annoying, and sometimes loud.

  I am never going to buy another Kia again and I would not recommend any one else buy one.  I can't even give mine away!
