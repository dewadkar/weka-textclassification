            Sometimes I pity Detroit. They really have made improvements in the 20 years that the Japanese gave them their first quality lesson. The cars that are being produced today by the Big Three are far superior to their past efforts. Unfortunately by the time they clear a bar that the Japanese set, the bar has been raised - three times over.

The Intrigue is another effort that exemplifies this situation. I had occasion to rent a 1999 Intrigue for a week. One week of in-town driving was sandwiched between two 250-mile highway runs. I cut some slack to the car since it was a rental as far as the luxury appointments went as rental companies tend towards generic stripper versions. Regardless of trim level, though, the overall quality of the car should remain the same. The car had 1500 miles on it, which qualified as new enough.

The exterior styling was not bad. Still a typical rolling GM box shape, but with some refinement and curves. Trim was sparse (this was, after all, a rental) and what did pass for trim looked flimsy. Visible defects were at a minimum.

My first impressions of the interior were negative. The gauges looked cheap and haphazardly laid out. The controls looked as if they had been laid out by committee rather than by engineers or users. The feel of the interior and controls was cheap. I envisioned levers and buttons breaking at the 60000 mile mark. This would be expected from a Dodge Neon or a Toyota Tercel, but to see this on a $20000+ car was an insult. 

The car never hesitated when started. One of the few beauty marks on this otherwise very ordinary car was the engine. The 3.8L V-6 was an absolute stallion in this car. Acceleration was highly impressive and rivaled many V-8 engine cars. This was a RENTAL engine?! I managed to get into triple digits in short order and the car was still pulling. I chickened out after 115 as traffic was becoming uncooperative and I began to see visions of cops trampling on my license. The transmission was good and took my abuse in stride. It was a bit noisy around town though not excessively so. The car itself made more noise than it should, especially for the price. Economy was fair and would have been better in the hands of a less leadfooted driver. Handling was average. This car lent itself better to the drag strip than the road course. Just another understeering front-wheel-drive car.

The foreign competition for this car is the Accord, Camry, and the 626. The Intrigue is a good match for the 626 - slightly less refined, comparable quality (second-tier), and more get-up-and-go. The Camry and the Accord are still bridges too far for the Intrigue.

Final summary: an improved effort, but a second-string effort.<br><br>
