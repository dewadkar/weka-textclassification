            The 2000 Silverado pickup has a good &quot;truck&quot; ride, roomy interior, my kids rated the Chevy extended cab the best of all the extended cab pickup on the market.  I can even fit in the back (6' 3&quot;, 275). I purchased the small V-8, which supplies plenty of power for my use (this is not a work vehicle) which is commuting and pleasure use.  As for the Ford, Dodge, Toyota vs. Chevy, we all have our likes and dislikes and my opinion won't sway a Ford lover (i.e. my brother).  The only complaint that I have is the new ABS braking system, Chevy has added a speed differential to the system which causes the ABS to activate more than it should (in my opinion).  On my truck if I am braking at a stop light and hit a bump or pot hole in the road the ABS will activate because of the speed difference in the speed of the wheels.  I have had this happen as much as 3-4 times in one day.  The pedal goes completely to the floor and I have no pedal pressure.  Chevy says that this is completely normal on the new trucks.  I have had ABS on the 95 and 96 chevy trucks with this never happening.  This braking problem doesn't give me alot of faith in the braking ability of this truck.<br><br>
