            I own two Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredos.  One 95 (wife's) and a 96 (mine).  Both have the V-6 4.0L engine, 2WD, four doors.  One would think that one year difference in the same model wouldn't warrant such a change in opinion of these two cars.  However that's not the case.

I love the body style of this series, however as most people know, there's more to a car than the looks of the exterior.  The interior of the 95 model is very dated.  Very hard plastic corners with a definite 1980's Ford Mustang style dash and seats.  There's not any &quot;elegant foam&quot; accents as found in the 1996 model.  During everyday driving, the interior creaks and rattles since there is no real absorbing properties for the dash furniture.  The 1996's interior is updated with a nice curvacious dash, faux wood accents, smooth center console and a clean quiet interior.

The handling of the two cars is quite different as well.  The suspension of the 1995 is very stiff and unforgiving.  Very similar to a 3/4 ton pickup, without the extra payload capacity.  And again, when doing any sort of off-roading, the cabin noise is immense with all the racket from the dash.  The 1996 model's handling is smooth, more like a luxury car.  You glide through corners rather than muscle through.  The power steering seems to have been updated as well because driving the later model isn't such a chore.  Taking the newer model off-road is a pleasure.  The suspension is great, gliding over semi-rocky terrain.  You really feel like you have greater control in the newer auto.  And fewer distractions like having to muscle the loose steering in the 95.

The transmissions seem fairly similar.  Both do some serious downshifting when in cruise control going up a moderate hill on the highway.  Thumbs down for both cars on this.  A promotion to the V-8 would probably help this quite a bit with a boost in torque.

Highway noise seems a bit quieter in the newer car, but not enough of a difference to sway an opinion one way or the other.  However the looser steering in the 95 contributes to some decent road walking.

That's about it really.  For the difference in price, it's worth it to bump up to the 1996.  I wouldn't have purchased the 1995 if I had a choice (I didn't).<br><br>
