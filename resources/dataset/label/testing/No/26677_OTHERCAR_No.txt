            I bought my 1996 Landrover Discovery SE in November of 1999.  I owned a 1990 Rangerover in 95' and fell in love with it, only to give it up after my brother convinced me to buy his Chevy Z71 pick up truck.  Well, after owning the truck for 1 yr. 1/2, I sorely missed my Rangrover and made my way to the Landrover of Houston Dealership where I had made many friends in the past due to the maintenance on the first one.  I fell in love with a white Discovery that I test drove and bought it on site.  

The initial meeting of my 96' Disco (Landrover Language) clouded my memory of how much maintenance I had to do on the first one.  All I could remember was how much fun I had with it going on mudding expeditions with my friends and driving it into a bayou and not getting stuck.  I was in awe at how these SUV's handle themselves while roughing it.  

The disco drove great on the highway and off the highway(dodging traffic backups), but it does topple alittle on turns and has poor pickup when at a stoplight.  I didn't have much trouble with it at the beginning, just 7 oil leaks(normal with any Rover), but that was taken care of with warranty.  Then, the inevitable happened, I filled up with gasoline about 3 months ago at a Diamond Shamrock, and it was full of water.  My Landrover never had a chance.  It stalled dead at the gas station and I had it hauled off to the dealership.  Bad news from the dealership, water had made it into all my fuel lines and they had to take the tank off and clean out all of my fuel lines($600) which was not much I thought.  After that, it ran ok. So, I made a claim with the gas station and they paid me for the repairs.  Well, one month later, the same but now, I can't make a claim with the gas station because I signed the check.. Three months later and one new fuel pump and alot of headaches, my car remains to give me problems with hiccups now and then.  I am constantly having to put gas cleaner in my car.  

Now, I have been trying to get rid of it and this time, fun or no fun, I will not buy another one if they paid me.  There's too much stress in one's life to have to mess with something like this all the time.<br><br>
