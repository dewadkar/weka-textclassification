            I agree with many that the styling of the 94 LHS still catches the eye, and still looks contemporary.  I must also concur,unfortunately, with those who have become disenchanted with the mechanics of the car.  I bought mine used with 39k miles on it in the fall of '98.  Within 3 weeks, the car began downshifting from highway speed without warning or reason. The hydraulic pump in the transmission had given out on the expressway at rush hour (thankfully the car was still under the 30 day purchase warranty).  

About a year later, the car began to buck violently ( a far scarier experience than the downshifting described above) at cruising speeds.  The episodes were of short duration, with the car downshifting to lowest gear at 70mph, resuming normal RPM's, then repeating.  It had the service crew baffled, until finally they attached an onboard computer/recorder and solved the mystery:  A bad ignition switch was shutting down and restarting the car at will.  $300 later all was well until recently, when the beast began stalling; first at idle, then dangerously at highway speeds, leaving me without steering or power brakes. This problem began at about 71k miles, and has yet to be resolved.  Need I mention that my mechanic cannot replicate the problem?

Of course, all the typical things are being visited upon me:  The AC needed $200 of work in 4/00; the thermostat just went bad, leaving me stranded on the NJ Turnpike in 96 degree heat, and the struts are knocking badly.

All in all, I regret the purchase.  This car's failings have endangered my life, and that is not forgivable<br><br>
