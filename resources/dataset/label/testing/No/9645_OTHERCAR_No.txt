            I was leased a 1997 dodge Neon brand new off the lot for sixteenth birthday.  Excited to have a car...any car I drove off into the sunset with the enthusiasm any new car owner would have (especially at sixteen).  

Three years later with no option left but to refinance and buy this vehicle I am a frustrated Neon owner with car payments that are $350 per month and enough problems with the car to total about $6000 dollars over the course of two years.

The first problem I had with the car were the breaks.  They squealed and pulled all the time and from wht I was told by my dealer that was just a common issue with Neons but it wasn't hazardous nor fixable.  About 1 month after the warranty expired I had to totally replace the brake system on this car due to no fault of my own.  I had my tires regularly rotated, the pads changed, and the suspension balanced, and yet all of the sudden I had no brakes what so ever.  $700 later they still squealed and pulled, but according to the dealer there was no way around that problem.  Just a year later I had to have the calipers replaced.  I stopped taking my car back to the dealer.

The other problem I have with this car is oil leakage.  According to mechanics that I have had look at it there is no problem, but I end up having to get my oil changed about every 1500 miles at which time, the service people tell me I have less than a quart of oil in my car to begin with.  Only after driving 1500 miles.  That problem is just getting ridiculous.  Especially when ok yeah before 3,000 miles they will top off for free but the next time around you have to pay for more oil than normal and usually end up having to purchase the more expensive oil that coats holes.

Every winter (seeing as though I live in Rochester, NY) I have to replace my bulbs because water, ice and snow collect in the light encasements.  Every winter I usually end up having to replace the rear or front bumper because they are plastic and if even the slightest drop of water freezes in a pinhole in the plastic it will produce a large ugly crack.  Most of these holes in the bumpers are due to rock deflection, and my Neon has textured bumpers so you can't just weld the crack and sand it.  You have to replace the whole thing or decrease the already null value of the car.

When I refinanced the car whose sticker price was $13000, I was told that I end up paying $16000 in total for a 3.5 year old car with 45,000 miles on it.  I have no words to describe what I felt when I heard that come through the phone.  Rage isn't even the tip of the ice berg.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the total maintenance of the car was almost 25% of that alone.  

A lot of people like Neons because they are cheap and if you have the time and money to invest in replacing the engine, and the plugs, the exhaust, and a good percentage of the body, you have the perfect base to start with.  But for the amount of money I am paying in just maintaining the base I have to work more hours just to be able to drive the thing to work let alone make it look pretty.  I have seen some very impressive Neons rebuilt by professional racers and mechanics.  More power to them.  But if you are looking for a reliable, inexpensive car to keep over all, this is not it.

By the way, right now I owe $6,000 on that vehicle, it's worth about $2,000 less than that according to the Kelly Blue Book unless I add a spoiler and some fog lights and maybe a audio system on top of all the other things that need to be replaced regularly.
