            1997 Cavalier 
(writing for my sister)
she bought this car from day one and it is a lemon.  GM laughs at her and so does the dealer.  Everything had gone wrong.  It is in the shop all the time.  From the crack in the flywheel to three starters to the wiper engines twice to bad fuel injectors, steering column, squeeks and rattles beyond a rat, to problems with the climate controls.  When does it end?  After her tire fell off driving down the street doing 20 MPH after pulling out of the driveway.  The axle gave out and the tire flopped off and was dangling by the brake line.  What does the dealer say?  Drive it in, we will fix it for you?  DRIVE IT IN??????  they would not give her a rental as they needed a few days to order parts.  I would never buy a chevy especially since I had a WORSE experience with my 1995 Baretta that fell apart also.  My saturn does not fall apart nor does it go into the shop and my Grand prix GTP is just as reliable as the saturn.  it has four times more toys and parts in it also.  The grand prix never had a squeek, rattle or problem.  Check with consumer reports first before you buy!  She unfortunately learned her lesson the hard way.  I told her to get a saturn or pontiac.  the cavalier has a 2.4 3 spd and the pickup stinks.  i can walk faster and it sucks up a lot of gas because of the 3 spd.  the car scares me<br><br>
