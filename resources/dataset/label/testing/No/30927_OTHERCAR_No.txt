            We bought this car used in 1999 and sold it this spring.  It was my first car out of college and we wanted something fun and sporty before we started a family.  We just sold it not because we didn't like it, but because we're expecting a baby and chose to get something with more room.  I know two other people with Sebrings and babies, and they swear that they don't have any problem getting the kids in and out.  I just didn't want the hassle of the 2 door car with the baby.  I was very sad to get rid of the car because it has been a lot of fun to drive.  We had very few problems with it, but those problems we did have were pretty major.  

The first trouble we had with it was water leaking into it.  I could hear water "sloshing" around somewhere for several weeks and couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  Then, after a heavy rain, the water soaked in from the floor of the front passenger side and spilled over to the driver's side.  I'd have to vacuum the water out every time it rained because we couldn't figure out the source of the leak.  We never did take it in anywhere because our warranty was up and it didn't cover leaks anyway.  We ended up putting duct tape (the horror!) where the body meets the top and that put an end to the water problems for a while.  After doing some research, we found out that the car is designed to take water in between the body and top but then channel it so it drains out from a spot under the car by the doors.  Our problem was just that these drain holes were just plugged.  After that, we just kept the holes unplugged and no more leaks!  

Then, this past winter, as I headed out the driveway, the front driver's side wheel fell off!  Yes, it completely fell off!  The problem apparently was with a ball joint that had broken.  After research again, we found out that this particular problem is more common than I'm comfortable with.  And apparently there had been a recall shortly before we purchased the vehicle but we'd never been informed about it.  The Chrysler dealer wouldn't reimburse us for the repairs because the vehicle had so many miles on it.  But if we'd known about the recall four years prior, we would have had it repaired at that time.  We weren't too pleased with the dealer after that and I'd never go back there again.  Anyway, I was really lucky that I wasn't going faster or I could have hurt myself or someone else.  The dealer didn't seem to care about that at all.

Another problem we had was with the brakes.  Was this car ever hard on the brakes!  We ended up replacing the brakes several times on this vehicle before we finally sold it this spring.  It wasn't like we were getting cheap brakes all the time, either.  Again, after some research, we found out that Sebrings are hard on brakes.  And the brakes ALWAYS squeaked so it was hard to tell when they were going bad.
