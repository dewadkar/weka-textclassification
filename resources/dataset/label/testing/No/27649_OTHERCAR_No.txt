            As a young single college student, I could not afford a new car so when I found a purple Hyundai Accent at a good price I jumped on it.  It was slightly used but seemed to be in good shape.  I loved almost everything about it, mainly because it worked.  There were a few things I did not like about it, i.e., the radio had a code so it could not be stolen but when my battery went dead I would have to enter that code in, a code which took forever to receive from the company.  I did not like not having automatic locks or windows but I did like the rear defroster and the pickup this car had.  But what really made me decide to never buy one of these cars again was when I decided to trade it in for a newer car.  I had owned this Accent for over a year only to discover it wasn't worth even half what I owed on it.  I will never buy another Hyundai again.<br><br>
