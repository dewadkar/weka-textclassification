            I live in Spain, Europe. I used to own an A8 and when I bought it I thought it was a great car. And it really was, BUT.... my car got big faults since the beginning. The first day, engine suddenly stopped when brakes were activated. And stopping the engine, brakes and direction were also lost (a very dangerous situation!!). After this fault was solve, then the windscreen cleaner also brokedown. Later, the whole transmission was gone. And the glass of the window...and many others  faults. Car is safe (specially because 4X4, multi airbags... ), luxury and extremely comfortable, but I expected much more quality when I bought it. One car as expensive as A8 should be more reliable.<br><br>
