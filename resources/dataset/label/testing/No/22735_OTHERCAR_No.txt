            I bought my Grand Am GT new in 1993.  I have had nothing but trouble with it from day one.  The window motor in the divers side door has been replaced twice, the computer once, the fuel injectors replaced once, the alternator replaced once, the air sensor replaced, the fog lights never worked right and the wiring to them even caught fire inside the dash.  

After having it &quot;tuned up&quot; with in 2 or 3 days it is back to running very rough again.  This has happened each and every time it has been in to be &quot;tuned up&quot;.  The handle on the air conditioner broke into pieces and the dash board squeaks when driving down the road.  All of these things happened with in the first 3 years of ownership.  Some, continue to go bad over and over again. 

My daughter now drives the Grand Am but I must say that it won't be for long.  I don't feel safe letting her drive it anymore.  It isn't a reliable vehicle at all.

I have written letters to the manufacturer about this vehicle ever since I bought it.  They have never responded to my complaints.  I will never own another Pontiac.  Service after the sale is terrible.
