            Here's an automobile that does everything well; however it could do it better.
The 3.5RL entered the menu of Acura offerings in 1996-97 as the flagship of the line, not replacing the Legend but as an improved and more refined Legend. (The TL actually replaced the Legend).
Here was the opportunity for Honda to really shine with the introduction of a V8 in their fleet of available cars for sale. Well, they failed to answer the call and actually lowered the horsepower from 235 of the Legend to 210 in the RL-bad move.
The competition was soon to respond with V8's and Acura was left in the dust.
Don't get me wrong, the RL is a good automobile and as I stated in the beginning it does everything well it just doesn't do it as well as Lexus, BMW,or Mercedes.
It needs a V8, it definitely needs a power lumber support (the silly crank Acura has been using does little to smooth the aching back). It could also use a more updated steering system that is adjustable to the type of driving you are doing; a compass would help and be a lot less expensive than the navigation system.
All in all, I had a pleasant experience with my 97 but I'm reluctant to release a 2000 when the competition is so far out in front.    <br><br>
