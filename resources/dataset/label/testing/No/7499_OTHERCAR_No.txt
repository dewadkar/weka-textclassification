            I recently bought the Dodge Stratus primarily for its sleek design.  The interior is very comfortable, with reclining seats that almost make into a bed. Nice feature when you are on a long trip and need to rest for awhile.  There is storage space in the door side pockets, in the center console, and in the traditional glove box. Also, storage space under the dash panel.  The stereo system is am/fm and cassette tape, with front and rear speakers. My interior had fabric apholstery, which was treated with scotch guard and are easily cleaned.  The rear seat folds down to allow loading of longer items in the trunk.The dash panel is easy to read and well lit a night and all controls are mounted o the steering column making them easy to reach.On the outside, the color I picked was dark green, and that was clear coated to protect the paint and make it easy to keep clean.It is  four cylinder engine, front wheel drive vehicle. I average around 18 to 20 miles per gallon in town and 27/28 mpg on the highway. One of my favorite features is the cruise control. It makes long trips so much easier.Other features that I like are the way it rides, drives and holds the road. The Dodge engineers did a great job on this design.Only one thing was missing from the one I bought..being a smoker...it didn't come with an ash tray.I haven't found anything else about the Dodge Stratus that I don't like.  When it comes time too replace it, I will probably replace it with a new Dodge Stratus.<br><br>
