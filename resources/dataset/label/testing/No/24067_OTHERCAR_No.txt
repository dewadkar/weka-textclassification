            I purchased this camera - my first digital camera for less than $100.  Good price.  My primary purpose was to take pictures for posting things to sell on eBay.  I have mixed feelings and thoughts about my purchase.

It's a good &quot;snapshot&quot; camera.  It takes decent pictures of people places and things (as long as they aren't too small).  Great for sending email photos.  Light. Easy to use.  Cheap...until you add the cost of batteries or an AC adapter.  You will either use up a lot of fairly expensive batteries downloading pictures to your computer or you will have to buy an AC adapter which costs almost half as much as the camera (and buying the adapter is definitely the cheaper route).

Unfortunately it is not very useful for doing what I wanted.  It can't take close-up pictures.  They are out of focus.  You can't turn the flash off so you have to control the amount of flash reaching your subject by manually covering the flash or you get washed out images.  

For my purposes, I think I would be better off looking for a $200 -$300 camera which has an AC adapter included, a flash you can turn off and the ability to focus on small objects and close-ups.

For carrying around to take snapshots of the family to email to friends and relatives, though, this might be a good first or back-up camera.<br><br>
