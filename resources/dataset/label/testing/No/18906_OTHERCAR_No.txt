            I have owned my 93 grand cherokee for about a year and a half now and can honestly say i would never purchase another one.  I originally bought it because i had always liked grand cherokees and my husband found this one that had only 65000 miles on it.

 After having it for a couple of months the check engine light started coming on and it started killing on us.  after having diagnostics done it turned out to be some sort of problem with a throttle regulator.  got that fixed and started having a serious front end shimmy with it which has turned out to be steering stabilizer problems.  about 2 weeks ago it started cutting out on us again and diagnostics show the fuel pump went out. pay 300 to buy a new fuel pump and not even a week later we are having transmission trouble and the grand cherokee remains parked outside my house while i borrow my mother's car everyday to get myself and my children off to all of our daily activities. 

4 times in 1 1/2 yrs on a car with only about 90000 miles on it is just way to much for me.  i think that it is still a very nice looking automobile and is very comfortable but as far is being trustworthy...that it is not.<br><br>
