            I got a 98 Ram wagon for the room - especially on longer family vacations.  I didn't get a conversion because I liked having 8 seats and having extra luggage space inside (and paying less).  I tried a Ford Club van, but liked the way the Dodge handled a lot better.

I still like the way it drives and the basic features, but there have been too many problems.  Some have been small and irritating.  For example, the side door handle fell off after a month or so.  When I opened up the inside panel to put it back on, I found the insulation inside the door was all wadded up at the bottom.  Also, the flashing underneath the van (kind of like extra thick aluminum foil) would catch the wind and bend down.  I was able to bend it back up and tuck the edge so this wasn't repeated.  

Some issues have been larger problems.  The back tail light wasn't sealed properly.  Consequently, every time I drove long distances in the rain, I found the back carpet soaked with water (buckets full).  The dealer handled this.  On another trip, the transmission failed. The dealer replaced the transmission.

The bottom line is that this is a pretty pleasant van to drive when it's working O.K.  But it's way too much trouble.  I won't own it one day past the end of it's warranty (buy the extended warranty if you get this vehicle).
