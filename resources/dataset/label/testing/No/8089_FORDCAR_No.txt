            My 1995 Ford Explorer Sport was my favorite vehicle that I've owned, when it was running!  The things that I liked about this SUV is that it is very roomy and handles very well.  These are about the only things that I liked.  Every month I had a problem with it, everywhere from that cooling system to the transmition.  Nothing but problems!!  Not only was it always broken down but it also was terrible on the gas mileage.  The two other cars that I have had for an extended period of time were a Toyota pickup and the car I have now is an Altima.  I haven't had a problem with either of these vehicles, notice that they are both foriegn cars.  I would not encourage anyone to purchase the 1995 Ford Explorer Sport unless given to you or you have too much money and you want to use it on repairs.  <br><br>
