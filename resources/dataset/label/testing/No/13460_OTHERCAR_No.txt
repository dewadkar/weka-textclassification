            My mother purchased a 1990 Topaz GS in 1991 and for the past five years she has had constant problems.  In that span of time, my mother has spent nearly $5000 to keep it running.  Recently, the CV joint was damaged and the car nearly lost a wheel.  The rack and pinions are not in good condition still.  About six months ago the alternator shorted out the electrical system and melted the engine wiring, costing nearly $1000 to replace.  Also, the seat material has not held up; it is torn beyond recognition on the drivers side.  The air conditioner does not work and the drivers-side window motor is non-functional.  In addition, the bracket that holds the right-side of the seat is broken.  To top it off, even a midget would find the cabin cramped.  One positive thing I can say about the car involves the body cage.  My mother was in an accident a few months ago where a woman hit the front side of the Topaz at about 10 mph.  The woman's car was crumpled while my mother's Topaz was only scratched.  In conclusion, bear in mind that saving money upfront does not always mean saving money overall.  <br><br>
