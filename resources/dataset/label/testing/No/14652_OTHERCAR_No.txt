            Well let me just start off by saying this car is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It will do everything fine when you initially buy it, but soon it will deteriorate into a piece of junk, a frame with a Tyco RC battery inside. I currently own this car, and it is my only mode of transportation. 

The setting: Springfield NJ, The Plot: waste of money! When I first saw it I was struck by its compact nature, and ability to show its prowess, without moving (ok so it was black and had a sunroof, I got weak). So I decided to buy it, at the amazing low price of $4500. Amazing to me, laughable by anyone who knows cars. Suprisingly I got a 4 year warranty out of the deal, which I was pleased with, even though I have yet to own up to this deal. Mainly because I�m too lazy to drive back up there and get it fixed. Now on the way home, It ran fine, considering I almost hit someone when I arrived back in town. The car worked for the first 2 months, but soon I was in the shop getting new shocks and struts. Which I needed, but was neglected to be told by the dealer. 


All was well again, I began to drive it with pride, soon enough, I was in an accident. I was rear ended by someone, who eventually paid up, but I was without my scoupe for a few weeks. The car was returned to me as if were brand new. Suddenly though, I noticed things were going wrong. The paint on the roof started peeling (to what is now, a primer gray), the engine was having trouble, it wouldn�t start sometimes, and above all it made funny sounds. Funny sounds the destroyer and tormentor of all car owners, who know nothing about cars. I ignored this minor annoyance and kept driving it. 

There was though, one thing that bothered me, and still does. As we all know the Rpm�s accelerate when you push the gas. In my version of the scoupe, the Rpm�s would accelerate and decelerate at their own will. To say this wasn�t scary is an understatement. Having your car speed up and slow down whenever it felt causes many traffic problems. Most recently being the brakes stopping my tires, in the middle of the highway. This left me screeching down the highway, screaming for my life. This car has caused me constant problems, and not because I know nothing about cars, but because this car is bad. Not just bad, but really really bad. 

To drive this car, is a deathtrap waiting to happen. A remote control car, without the control, or even the turning ability. I would not advise anyone to buy it. Well anyone who has some spare cash, and needs transportation, buy this car. Everyone else, don�t bother, life is too precious to be taken by this buzzing, humming, screeching weasel of the car kingdom.
