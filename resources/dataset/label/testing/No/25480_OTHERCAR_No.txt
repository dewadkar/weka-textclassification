            We bought a 1998 Saturn SL2 after hearing so many wonderful stories about satisfaction with Saturn the car and Saturn the company.  The reviews were fantastic so we were very confident in our choice of vehicle.

However, we have had numerous problems since buying the car in March of '98.  Specifically, replacing the mechanism for the electric windows.  The front windows have been fixed two times each and the back windows once each.  The current problem surrounds the &quot;Service Engine Soon&quot; light.  We have had our Saturn in for service because of this problem at least 6 times in the past year, most recently last week.  The &quot;solutions&quot; have ranged from replacing spark plugs, spark plug wires, changing the brand of gasoline, and eventually replacing the sensors which were found to be corroded.  None of these solutions have worked.  To top it all off, if I continue to drive the car with the SES light on, it will void my warranty.  If I were to take my car in for service every time this light came on, it would be at the Saturn dealership more than my own garage!

My Saturn has definitely NOT lived up to expectations, especially from a company who claims they are a &quot;Different Kind of Company.&quot;<br><br>
