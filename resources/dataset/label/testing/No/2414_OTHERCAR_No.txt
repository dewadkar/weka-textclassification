            I chose the Cherokee Country because I wanted a car that kept me above traffic, but not a real monster.  I Like it overall, it has kept me safe in ice skids, and took minimal damage when my friend sideswiped me.  It has two major problems:  It tips VERY easily.  Caution must be employed when making turns at any speed over 15mph.  Also, the four wheel drive in models from 1995 is unreliable, it is a manual shift, and slips out easily, and I have been caught in neutral unexpectedly.  Have these features in mind when considering this car.  The wheel base is really just too small for the height of the vehicle. <br><br>
