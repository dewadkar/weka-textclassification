                We purchased our 1994 Plymouth Grand Voyager second hand -- it had 32,000 miles on it and was 11 months old. We knew the previous owner -- sadly, we got to him just after he had traded it in to the dealer. We had been driving a 1988 Ford Aerostar purchased second hand and, prior to that, a 1984 Toyota van, bought new.
    When we bought the Toyota, our first van, we also looked at the comparable Plymouth and decided we greatly preferred the Toyota. But by 1995, when we bought the Voyager, it had become much more comfortable. The ride was far smoother than that of either the Toyota or the Ford van we'd owned, the controls seemed better to the driver, the seats were far more easily removed. The V-6 engine gave us the power we needed, especially when entering highways in the city or climbing mountains or serious hills. Overall, we were delighted. 

    But at about <i>55,000</i> miles (far too soon, in our opinion), we started to experience some "odd power things" while driving -- you know, something just doesn't seem right but you can't quite put your finger on it? And heaven forbid it should happen when you go to the mechanic! Eventually, the car lost power without any reason one morning (as I was turning left to get onto the entrance to a major bridge). After I nursed the car to the side and got it towed, it turned out the transmission was gone. Under <b>extended warranty</b>, Plymouth replaced the transmission without cost to me. . . thank God we had taken the dealer's advice to buy an extension when we bought the car second hand.

    But then at <i>102,000</i> miles, the transmission went again -- this time <i>not</i> under warranty. Looks like Plymouth vans (and probably the Dodge vans too -- both are Chrysler, after all) have transmissions that don't like to last much more than 55,000 miles. 

    The only other problems we've encountered were an electronic switch that had to be replaced because the engine kept cutting off, thinking it was too cold to run, and routine maintenance. The cruise control doesn't always work, we must admit -- it won't turn on sometimes. Overall, though, we like the van -- the tight leg room in the rear seat doesn't have an impact on us -- and the Grand Voyager model lets us pull that seat back a little further for more legroom. But we really believe a transmission should last more than 50,000 miles.
