            One thing that is for sure kia is resonably priced,but is it a good car?I was never really interested in kia before until I heard from some consumers reports that it was the best car deal of the year for 99.

So i decided to purchase the sephia Ls.I have now owned the car for about nine months.Lately its been having alot of problems.The first thing was the three recalls which were the brake roters,window wipers,and finally the fuel pump.I have never heard of so many recalls on a new car before so that kind of put me on alert.

Well after that my muffler had to be replaced for some problem.Also,ever since I got the car i noticed that when you acellerated the engine sounded very loud.I brought the car to the dealer and they couldn't figure it out.That's not the end of it!

Now my paint has started to chip off which is pretty weird.I brought it to the dealer and they didnt want to deal with it and told me to take it to the insurance company who later told me kia is responsible since its not caused by damage.Well as you can see i have had nothing but problems with my Kia.Hey maybe mines just a dud.From now on I think i will stick to the cars that have a good reputation. <br><br>
