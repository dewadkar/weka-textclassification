            I've been an owner and driver of a 2001 Chev Malibu for almost two years now. We were comparing it to the Chrysler Sebring and Ford Taurus. The Malibu seemed like a more substantial car than the Sebring, with its standard V6 power. And it was a better price than the Taurus. So we signed on the dotted line and ever since regretted not spending an extra $1000 CDN on the Taurus. Why? Put simply, the Malibu is full of so many rattles and buzzes, that for a minute I thought I was still driving the 1993 Mustang convertible I traded in for it. To make matters worse, the dealer seems unable to solve my complaints. This is what seperates US-made vehicles with the Japanese competition. There is just no pride in workmanship. Yes, I test drove offerings from Nissan, Honda, and Toyota. And yes, I noted the obvious attention to fit and finish that always seems absent in US-made offerings. But like a loyal Big Three Town boy, I bought the Chevy. But enough harping, there are some good things to say about this vehicle. First, V6 power (170HP) is notable in this class and price range. $23,300 CDN. The motor provides the perfect amount of power for a vehicle of this size and weight. A bit of a gas guzzler in the city, but sips on the highway making it a good value for the long distance commuter. The ride is comfortable and quiet. Handling is very good, with only a bit of torque steer to speak of. All the stuff you need for a comfortably equipped car is there... A/C, speed control, power locks and windows, etc. We've been on a few long trips and found it to be a comfortable and pleasant vehicle on the long haul. For about $1000 CDN more we could have gotten into a model with leather seats and a moonroof. But to me that would be closely approaching the cost of a base-model Impala. There is a point where one is adding too many bells and whistles to a car that is only meant to provide modest transportation. And that's something the Malibu does well. Not excellent, but well.
