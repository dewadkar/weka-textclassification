            The glut of used cars in the automotive marketplace is a buyer's delight. I looked at the Infiniti J30 as a well-reviewed car that was discontinued in 1997, making it a low-cost sports-luxury alternative to the Lexus ES300.

While the ES300 holds its value very well, driving one makes me think overdressed Toyota Camry all the time. In fact, the ES300 is built on the Camry platform. Infiniti's challenger to the sports-luxury class was the Jaguar-esque J30 (did the J stand for Jag?).

For some reason, these cars have depreciated faster than the ES300. To my eyes, the ES300 looked like a Camry with extra trim while the Infiniti J30 has distinctive curves that looks a bit like today's Jag X-Type.

<b>Inside the car</b>
The first impression of the inside of the J30 is one of well-tailored opulence. The classy Infiniti analog clock smack in the middle of the dashboard is a nice touch. But upon closer inspection of all 5 J30's I test drove, all had leather interiors with worn, busting seams. All 5 also suffered from the same wear-spot - on the sill of the driver's window where the driver might rest his arm. Clearly the quality of the leather was at issue here.

Ergonomics are first-rate. Seating comfort was good in the front or back seats. However, the driver's seat was lacking side bolsters making for very slippery turns.

<b>Driving impression</b>
Quiet but not Lexus quiet, the Infiniti J30 hums like a finely honed sewing machine. In the sports-luxury category, this is a car that tilts more toward the luxury side. This surprised me as I was driving the J30t - the 't' designates their Touring version with supposedly firmer suspension settings.

<b>Overall</b>
If you're looking for a sportier car, there are better choices with seats designed for spirited driving. Lexus ES300 properly equipped or a BMW 3-series would be better choices as used cars. Clearly reasons why those cars do not depreciate as quickly as the J30. The Infiniti J30 is a nice car but with some long-term quality issues (leather) that have not worn well.
