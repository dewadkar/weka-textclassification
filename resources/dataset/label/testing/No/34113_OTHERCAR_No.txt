            We purchased our Discovery in 1994, the 1st year they were released in the US. This year alone it was in the shop for 16 repairs, all covered under warranty and that was just the 1st year. It hasn't stopped. The rear windshield washer was repaired at least 4 times (still isn't working as I write). The roof leaked, the rear view mirror fell off, The tail pipe fell off, the steering wheel &amp; column needed to be replaced (something to do with the airbag), intermittent wipers didn't work, sway bar was loose, rear air conditioning disconnected, cassette player had to be replaced and other minor repairs too numerous to mention. The best part of the whole deal is that now, 6 years and 78,000 miles later the blue book value is only $10,500. But we were offered $7,000 to trade it in. It is also the noisiest car I have ever had the sad luck of owning. I have to say, in the car's defense, if it weren't for these nit picky repairs, the car does run. But you couldn't pay me to buy another one. We're on our 4th pair of shocks in 6 years (isn't this an off-road vehicle), 2 door locks are broken, 1 electric window is on it's way out and I can't forget the rust. I has been rusted almost from day 1. A common trait in all Land Rovers I hear. I can go on but I have to stop I'm getting depressed. My epinion - leave it undiscovered.
