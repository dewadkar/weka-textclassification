                 Zip, zip, zip, first 6 months with this car were the happiest ever. What handling, speed, and comfort. Upon entering the car, you sit down, I mean down, it's low. Shut the door, (watch the automatic seat belt, it's dangerous), and it's like you've entered a new transportation experience. Felt like the captain of my own personal airplane. Lots of leg room. Great seats, that are somewhat reclined. Great responsive steering with all wheel drive made me feel like a race car driver, but was god awful in the snow. It goes downhill from here.....
     First the turbo goes at about 7,000 miles, quite expensive to replace. Then the alternator, replace that too. 3 weeks later the alternator goes again, so now we know there is an electrical problem, we just have to find it, but while were in here looking, your exhaust manifold is shot, we have to replace it. More money. 
     Electrical problem seems to be, something with the automatic door locking alarm, this is bad, when battery dies, you can't even get in the car at first, once we figured a way in, it wouldn't start anyway, it was hit or miss with the car actually starting for weeks. Drive 10,000 more miles, and get a new what, yes another turbo unit.
     Alternator starts to go again, I finally figured out what kept draining it, can you say brake light switch? 
     The aluminum rims are horrible, they'd dent if a three year old hit them with a rock, nevermind skimming a curb. High performance tires that were required for my ultimate driving experience were quite expensive, but that was wasn't a problem, because when the car actually ran, it was one of the most comfortable, smooth, quiet cars I have ever been in. If you like gambling, this could be the car for you.
