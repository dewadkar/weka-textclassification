            <B>Introduction</B>
I bought this camera because I read that it is a good camera for it's price tag. I do agree with this, but that doesn't mean that it is a <i>good</i> camera.

<B>What's Good</B>
- I do love this camera. I really do. My friends and I use it all the time and we have our little website as a nice photo album and everything. Digital cameras rock! Traditional film is soooo... old school.

- This camera is excellent for indoor pictures no matter what the lighting is, it always takes good pics inside, the flash even works well in complete darkness. For taking pictures inside, this camera functions very well.

- The zoom is a nice feature, but if you don't need the zoom you can get a better camera in the same price range.

- I love digital over traditional film, no taking the film in to be developed! Awesome! Plus, putting the photos on a website takes no extra effort, they're already in digital form and ready for the web.

- Another thing I liked was the weight of the camera. It is nice and heavy and feels really sturdy. Some people may not like the weight for carrying it around, but I thought the extra weight felt good while taking pictures.

<B>What's Bad</B>
- 1 Megapixel is not high quality. It is pretty good for most situations, but don't expect more than average results. Any pictures taken outdoors are not good. The subject in the foreground will look nice and clear, but anything somewhat far away will be nice and blury.

- This camera connects via a serial connection. This means that it will take FOREVER to transfer your pictures.

- Battery life is only as good as expected for any digital device. It easily lasts for 100 pictures on 4 AA batteries. So add rechargable batteries and a charger to the price.

- The 4MB card doesn't fit many high quality pictures. I haven't used the 4MB card for so long I don't even remember how many it fits, but somewhere around 12-15.

For my camera I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger for about $30. I also bought a 32MB card (Holds 100 high quality pics) and a USB transfer device for about $100 for the two items. The batteries last until the card is full and that's about it... so it works well for me. This takes care of all but one of the Bad points, but also adds $130 to the price tag. That $130 could have gotten a higher quality camera with a USB connection. 

Even though I don't recommend it, I still love my camera. Digital is a lot of fun, so if you just want an okay digital camera at a good price then this one is perfect!
