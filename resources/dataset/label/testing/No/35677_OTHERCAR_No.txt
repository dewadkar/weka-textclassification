            This is my mother's second Plymouth Voyager and as hard to believe that anything could be worse than her first one, bought brand new in 1984. This one is far worse. The 1994 Grand Voyager has a frightening list of potential problems and recalls. This car has had the automatic transmission replaced at 86, 000 miles and the tensioner for the power steering and power brakes just failed at 94,000 miles. Both are listed as common problems. The local Chrysler Plymouth Dealer told me that he was surprised that the Automatic Transmission had failed at 86,000 miles, as they usually failed much sooner. He explained that the first ones had plastic parts in the transmission that melted due to the heat of operation. The cost for replacement was $1500. The power steering and brakes tensioner failed just last week, fortunately it was in a parking lot as mom had just driven 60 miles over mountain roads with 5 children in the minivan. There are recalls for the Air Bags going off in your face when you start the car, rapid brake wear, doors that fly open in an accident, bolts that hold the seats down failing in accidents, etc. Really too many things to list. You may wish to check Consumers Reports or similar publications regarding the Chrysler line of minivans and there long list of problems. Did I mention that the interior is falling to pieces. The rear window washer sprayer just fell off one day. Her 1984 Plymouth voyager had frequent failure of the electric windows belts, the wiring harness shorted out taking out the stereo and with in the 1st 6 months when you blew a fuse if you hit the brakes when the headlights were on which the Plymouth Dealer who sold mom the car brand new never could get fixed even after several attempts. We had to leave out the fuse for the running lights or the brake light fuse would blow leaving mom with now brake lights. I have talked to several other owners of these minivans and they all have stories like this. Transmissions failing and the interior trim and parts just going to pieces. By the way my mother has the maintance done and drives this minivan in a reasonable fashion.  So my advise is Buy a Toyota instead! It may cost more to buy yet you will save so very much in the long run. Thank You Kris<br><br>
