            In January of '98 I purchased a '97 model Jetta GL from East Coast Automotive in Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  By January of the following year, I began hearing strange noises from the front end.  Over the next six months I brought the car back at least four times.  The service department wouldn't hear the noise, or they would make some adjustment to the axle or wheel.  Finally, in June of '99, they replaced the axle.  Thankfully, I haven't had to go back........until today.  

I recently disconnected the battery on the car so I could reach down and replace the blinker bulb.  I had forgotten that this enables a security feature on the stereo, locking it up until the code is provided.  I went to a more conveniently located dealer who wanted to charge me $40 to get the code.  Since I didn't buy the car there, this wasn't  totally unexpected.  I returned to East Coast expecting them to pull the sterio free of charge.  (I've done it before, it takes 2 minutes but requires a special tool)  Amazingly, they also wanted to charge for the &quot;labor&quot;.  

I'm to be married in April.  My fiance's car has 120,000 miles on it.  Think we'll be doing some car shopping this year?  Think we'll be looking at Volkswagen?<br><br>
