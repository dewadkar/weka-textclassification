            I got the VW Golf because it was roomy, had a hatchback (I transport animals often), 4 doors, and the concept that VWs last forever (I know several people with more than 200,000 miles on their VWs).  I wanted a car that I would drive until it died because I *hate* shopping for cars.  I like a lot about it - the seats are nice and high (great for us short people), it shifts smoothly and easily, gets very good gas mileage (between 29-35 - I even got near 40 a few times!).  The AC is great, radio is decent, and it has quite a bit of zip for a mommy-mobile (although not the zip you'd find in a sports car).  It hums along at high speeds (havne't tried more than 100mph, but it doesn't whine even at that).

However, a year and a half later, i'm shopping for new cars.  Since I bought the car (used, off-lease, 30k miles, $8000), the following things have needed repair/replacement:
oxygen sensor, radio knobs, brakes, vacuum hose, strut mount bearings, door locks (twice!), moulding on the outside of the car.  It's had oil leaks, exhaust problems, mysteriously wouldn't go into reverse for a month etc.  Although the brakes are fine, to factory specs, etc., I have never liked them.  They feel spongy, but 3 dealers have told me that is normal.  It's been in the shop almost as much as it has been out of the shop. 

The good news is I bought an extended warranty and have gotten my money's worth out of it.  Also, the "famed" VW immortal engine is doing just fine at 50K miles (as should any decent engine).  

My next car will be something like a Honda or a Saturn that won't need to be in the shop on a weekly basis for some minor annoyance.

Repairs on imports are expensive!  Get a warranty!!
