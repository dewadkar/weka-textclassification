            I, like many retro style enthusiasts loved the look of the new PT Cruiser from Chrysler. It had all the appeal of a 50�s style Hot Rod with all the modern nuances that make it a practical daily driver. I signed up for the �YES� I will definitely buy one newsletter from Chrysler and checked it out at ALL the Autoshows. Then came (at long last) test drive day! I could have cried� I understand that it�s built on the Neon frame. I also understood that it has the same powertrain as the Neon. Having previously owned a DOHC 150HP Neon, I was impressed with the Neon�s performance. The disappointment came when I drove the PT Cruiser and found that the additional weight, larger body with the higher center of gravity made the PT Cruiser a SLUGGISH underperforming (almost to the point of laughable) Not-Rod!
But Wait! There�s good news! Talk of a GT Cruiser with a V6 and all the trimmin�s too! Save up your pennies boys and girls because the best is yet to come!
Your truly disappointed, yet remaining hopeful,
