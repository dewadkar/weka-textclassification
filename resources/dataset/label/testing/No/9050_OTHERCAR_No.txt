            Dollar Rent a Car actually had the guts to rent out a Kia Sportage to our family during our spring break vacation. When told they must be kidding, that I could purchase this car for less then it costs to rent, they just growled some more and told us to get out. My impression of the Kia Sportage still hasn't changed much from my initial sterotype of it being the low end SUV for people who want to own a new car for a used price, but want their car to run like used. 

The cars interior is very cramped. No space like I felt in the Ford Explorer. The seats are rather uncomfortable, and the door handles are so small the pinky finger must be used, or pinch your thumb and index together to open it. The sliding windows controls are a bit odd, and we laughed because when we first started up the car the windows rolled down and we couldn't figure out how to roll them up for a minute or so... for a while I felt very irate that I was stuck inside this car, then came the realization that you had to push from underneath on the sliding window controls to make it go back up. Maybe I'm just stupid :)

The handling is OK for the price range, definitely not the type a rugged SUV like that is supposed to have. The brakes are slower then a normal car, but I haven't actually driven a SUV (not my style) before this may be perfectly normal. The handling is OK, but definitely not top notch or anything close to the more expensive competitors. You get what you pay for.  If you are willing to sacrifice looks and performance for the price tag, the  I could see how a Kia Sportage might be good for you. But please take a test drive first. For the rest of us, I would recommend staying away until the problems get fixed, or until you save enough money to buy a used Explorer/Suburban/whatever instead.
