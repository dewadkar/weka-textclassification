            I own a 1996 Mitsubishi Galant S.  My husband bought it for my birthday - new.  I should not complain too much because this car has gotten me through 3 years without MAJOR trouble, but there have been some annoying problems here and there.  First off, the first time it rained after we bought the car, we woke up to soggy seats!!  No, it wasn't because we left the windows down - the windshield had not been properly installed.  Now, my husband works for an auto maker (not Mitsubishi) and I know that cars are (or should be!) put through rigorous testing before they leave the factory.  How they missed a leaky windshield, I will never know!!  The second thing to 'go wrong' was that the gear shift (automatic) button got stuck.  It still worked; however, who knew when it would just quit working all together.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to have your car stuck in reverse!! NOT!  The third thing to go wrong was the tape deck  just up and quit working.  It now eats tapes if it tries to play them at all.  The stereo itself is not even really that wonderful.  It seems now that it's gotten really cold these last few days, the automatic station selectors (memory) have decided to freeze up on me - even when the car has been driven for 1/2 an hour or so.  

As noted in the 'specifics' section of this review, the car is not terribly roomy either.  I realize that 2 car seats will take up room in any vehicle, but my childrens carseats practically 'touch'.  Also noted in the specifics is that the seats are not all that comfortable.  They are more like hard as a rock on my bottom.  At least the seats are fully adjustable.  That tends to help a bit.

Overall, in my opinion, its just an average car that gets me where I need to go and luckily, back again.  I have not been too terribly impressed and will definitely opt for something different when we are ready to get something new.<br><br>
