            I own the 98 2wd s-10 ls and have owned other trucks in the past. I have never experienced the wet road horror that I have with this truck. Unless you're planning on driving with elephant permanently parked in the back, be aware and cautious. Turning at a stop sign with 15% grade and wet roads means 0-60 times of 30-40 minutes.  Dangerously light in rear..  Other comments: 
cons:
--2.2 liter is under powered even for the ls
--tight squeeze
--barely room for a coat behind the seats and your dog would be uncomfortable riding in front!!
--makes irritating raddle at 3000 rpm under dashboard, &quot;somewhere&quot; according to chevy techs.
--ABS engages at a whim leaving you w/out stopping power over railroad tracks and/or metal manholes in the road
