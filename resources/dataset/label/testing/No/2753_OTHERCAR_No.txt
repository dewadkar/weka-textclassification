            While I agree that the Volkswagon Jetta is a good, reliable car....I do want to mention that you should buy an older model.  We have owned two Jetta, the first was a 1990 and the second 1997...we had much better luck with the older car.  There is nothing mechanically &quot;wrong&quot; with the newer model, but things keep falling off the darn car.  I am serious.  They have everything GLUED on (they should have used extra strength crazy glue).


The first thing to fall off was the back brake light (the one in the window) it was just hanging there one day, for no apparent reason.

The next thing to go was the drivers side molding.  I heard something slapping against my car and sure enough it was also just hanging there for no apparent reason.

Next was the passenger side molding (you knew this was coming).....again the slapping sound, I thought I could make it home, but I lost it on the road.  Now I have big &quot;bullet&quot; holes in my passenger door where the molding used to be.

Next was the little lock thingy that you push up and down, again this popped off for no apparent reason (seeing a theme here).

A few months ago my husband broke a key off in the ignition, this might have been our fault, it was a first for us though.

Right after getting the starter replaced my husband was unlocking the passenger side door (this poor abused door) when he pulled his key out, the whole lock came with it.  Lucky for us the lease is up next month.<br><br>
