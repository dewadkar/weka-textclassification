            The RAV4 is an attractively styled vehicle. The Limited Edition that I purchased has some nice features - dark tinted windows, alloy rims, all power features, and a nifty alarm with keyless remote.

 Having driven mine for 5 months now, I have a good feel for its performance. Having only a 4 cylinder engine leaves it with much to be desired in the power category. Even with my 5 speed manual transmission, going from a complete stop is slow going at times. Cabin noise is a big problem. You have to crank the radio to hear it when driving over 45-50 mph. Its really rediculous.Another thing that is not impressive is its performance in the snow. I think it may be the tires, as Toyota is notorious for putting cheap tires on their new vehicles. A good set of snow tires should remedy the slipping around I experienced. The RAV4 does offer excellent ground clearance for getting over snow piles in the roads and the slip differential feature is wonderful for getting out when you are stuck in the snow. 

The only thing that has gone wrong so far with my RAV4 is the remote alarm button died for no reason. Have to get it checked out.The interior of the vehicle has fold up seats in the back which allows for extended cargo area. When the seats are not folded back, the cargo area is small when loading groceries. It holds less than it looks. Also, for a tall person, leg room can be an issue when sitting in the back seats. Its a little cramped. 

I would recommend this vehicle to someone who does not need a lot of power or speed in their vehicle, and who is not a large person. I also do not recommend this vehicle for families. You will feel crowded in the RAV4. Better to spend a little more on a van or the Toyota 4-Runner. Although Toyota does offer a very reliable product, I think the RAV4 is overpriced by at least $3,000. I would probably not buy another one. We also own a Toyota Avalon which is a whole other story- a very excellent car that I will do a review on.   <br><br>
