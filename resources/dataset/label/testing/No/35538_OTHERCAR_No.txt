            I have been using a 4700 for a year now, took 2000 pictures and avi's with it. That one is a great camera. I thought that the newer more expensive 6800 would be better. It really is not worth the price difference. 

It's basically the same camera but is slightly repackaged. And the changes are not for the better. It feels clunkier, not as easy to use as the 4700. The 4700 just feels right holding it, this one feels like it's going to fall out of your hand. The buttons on the 4700 are placed better, it is a joy to use. The 6800 selector sits orthogonally to the way you would expect.

I do not know who this F.A. Porsche is, but Fuji wasted money on him/her. The shape of the 6800 is minimally different, but just enough to annoy.

(And why did this hotshot designer whose name is printed on my lens cover not think about putting a second strap attachment point on the left side? That way you could have hung the camera from your neck where it belongs, instead of dangling it from your wrist like some expensive purse?)
 
The cradle is a good idea, and so is the extended recording time and audio only, though I do not think I will use those that much.

Even the batteries on the 4700 were better, you charged one pair while you used the other. This one has a single battery
that charges while in the camera. Not so good.

Buy a 4700 and a 128 MB smart card, and you're better off than with this. Unless you need the pc conferencing - get a webcam for $50 - and long audio recordings - an MP3 recorder should do the trick...
