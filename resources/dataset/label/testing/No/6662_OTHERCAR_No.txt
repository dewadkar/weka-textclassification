            I have to preface this re-write by apologizing for my naivete and infatuation with my new car. These things, along with my inexperience driving blinded me into reviewing the 2 door 2000 Chevy Tracker positively. I have to take back that review just over a year later.

In the past year I have managed to only put on 5000 miles on the car because I could not take it on campus with me, however that has nothing to do with anything. Before I even turned over to 5000 I took my car for an oil change and explained a slight problem I was having with my accelerator sticking. 

Well, this turned out to be a major problem that involved dropping the transmission and a gasket kit. I was not a happy owner.

Now, only 2 weeks after this "operation" the car is experiencing problems shifting gears. I find it extremely difficult to go uphill, the engine just will not kick in.  In addition to these problems, the car is very difficult to control in general. At higher speeds (anything above 30mph) the car has a tendency to drift, which only gets worse if the sun roof is back, the windows are open, or it is convertibled.

Even though the car was just serviced, my "service engine soon" light is up and my car isn't shifting, and I'm very upset. Now I'm angered by the lease my mother binded me to ( the car was a gift for my 18th birthday) and now I'm stuck for 2 more years with a car that has caused more trouble in one year that most cars cause in 5.

The rest of this review was written a year later:
I have since had few problems with my car, except for one major issue. It is currently totalled. I was broadsided while making a left turn and it severly damaged the car. Though it is understandable that my car would bne totalled after such an impact, it is vital to report the importance of my being alone at the time of the incident. It was my passenger's side that was impacted and if someone had been there, they would be seriously injured, IF they survived. 
The passengers seated was bent into a near vertical position, the door smashed backwards off the hinge and the side of the car wrapped entirely around the seat. I am told that these cars supposedly do well in crash tests, I however find it hard to believe this following such an accident. Howver I can thankfully say that all my injuries were caused by the seatbelt, an inevitable damage, if you religiously wear your seatbelt (which, by the way, you should).
