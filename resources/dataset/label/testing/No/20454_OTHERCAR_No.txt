                 An exclusive designer by the name of <b>Mr. John Dale Delorean</b> had a master plan of building an exclusive sports car that would never rust or corrode and provide excitement for the very few who could afford one of his prestigious cars. The DeLorean was finished in brushed stainless steel over a fiberglass body, but his dream soon was turned into a complete nightmare once the production car hit the market.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

You sit behind the front fascia of the <b>interior</b>, it's relatively claustrophobic, but it is comfortable enough, as is the overall ride. Is it quick and sharp enough to be a sports car? Not at all; there just isn't enough power from the V6 to give either impressive acceleration or top speed. The DMC was intended to provide a futuristic look, with its full electronic gadgetry, stainless steel body, and Jetson like gullwing doors. Unfortunately, its performance attributes in all respects were not as impressive as the car's looks. The V6 engine is matched with a Renault 5-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. An automatic was an option. 

<b>Handling</b> is good, but this too did not impress me, even with the Lotus inspired suspension you can feel body roll normally associated with larger cars. 

<b>Braking</b> is adequate, despite this car having its original pads and braking equipment the DMC provided sure stops when coming to a stop light.

     The Lotus influence is enormous; the backbone <b>chassis</b> is unmistakably a Lotus design very similar to the Esprit's. It looks like a very elongated X, with the V6 engine mounted between the  chassis arms and the rear, that is balanced by putting the fuel tank and radiator at the other end of the chassis. There is more Lotus influence in the suspension, which is more compliant than other sports cars, using long semi-trailing arms at the rear.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>


   The <b>interior</b>, like I said before, is very small. The seats are supportive, but the leather feels cheap. There is a solid center console that separates the driver and passenger. The steering wheel is thick enough, yet it's not as sporty as it should be. The air conditioning in my  DeLorean was more 'warm' than 'cold'. In-fact road trips to Palm Springs California were "hot as hell." This car had only 40,000 original miles, yet the interior looked worn. There are fun gullwing doors, its always nice to show off this feature whenever possible. There are not too many amenities, but ergonomics are good, including an interesting electric window opening set in the doors.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
    
  The <b>exterior</b> is very original, there is no confusing a Honda Civic with a DMC DeLorean. There is plenty of rear vision, The Lotus inspired chassis means there's a deep spine through the cockpit. The rims are little on the 'non sporty' side, but not too bad. The design is very aerodynamic with a low drag coefficient. Overall the design was ahead of its time, however today this car seems quite dated.

       The <b>price</b> for these cars vary, I have seen some sold for as low as $10,000 and some for as much as $40,000. It's all about being in the right place at the right time. Personally I would never own one of these cars if I had to pay for it, but collectors love this car because it's rare and for many other personal reasons. 
     
<i>Final Thoughts:</i>

This would have been an excellent car if the DeLorean boasted much more power, better handling attributes and a cheaper price. The DMC DeLorean does offer a good value on the collectors market, however you will be hard pressed to find one. Most of these cars are in the hands of collectors. This car is not recommended as a car, as a novelty item maybe, I personally would not want this car as my daily driver.
