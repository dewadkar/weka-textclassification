            We bought a 1999 Dodge Durango 4X4 SLT Plus with all the options and a Magnum 5.2l SMPI V8. We really loved the Durango and took it on a cross country trip. We just had a few minor things that needed fixing during all this time. Today my wife experienced a &quot;Run away durango&quot;, it took a life of its own. When in the driveway, she had the car with the engine running, transmission on parking and emergency brake on. When she shifted to drive and removed her foot from the brake, the engine started racing and the car just took off (it did not matter that the parking brake was still on). Neither foot was on the break or gas pedals. She was going straight towards a fence until my daughter on the passenger side  yelled &quot;stop the car, put the brake&quot; at which point my wife stopped the car by pressing hard on the break.

Immediately after this incident my wife contacted the Dealer service people and the managers. Afterwards she also contacted Chrysler's main office and explained what happened. According to the dealer this is the first incident of this kind. Chrysler's main office would not provide information of similar incidents.
Any positives on this car get wiped out by the potential safety hazard of the above incident.

questions:
Has anyone experienced this problem with a Chrysler Auto or SUV?
Was the problem corrected?
What was done to get it corrected?
