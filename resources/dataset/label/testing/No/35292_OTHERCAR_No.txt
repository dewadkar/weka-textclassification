            I bought my 1996 Chevy Corsica about a year ago and it has given me nothing but problems! I bought because it was a cheap car and my boyfriend was the car salesman, so I got a good deal (I thought). The car ran great until 6 months later when it just suddenly quit on me and gave me nothing but headaches for the next 7 months!!!

The car was not particular on when it would quit!! It quit at all different speeds, from 60 MPH down to 10MPH and it even quit while stopped at stop lights. It didn't matter what the weather was, humid or dry, rainy or not, it quit. It also didn't matter how long it was driven, it would quit on a 10 minute drive just as easy as an hour drive. It would also vary how long it took to start it again, if it even started! Sometimes it took 10 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes, and a couple of times it didn't start at all so I had to get it towed. It never quit at a certain speed, temperature, etc... So it was a nightmare trying to get the problem fixed!!

I think all together, in that 7 month period, I had the car to 4 different garages about 10 times always with the same results. They either couldn't get the problem to duplicate, or they did get it to quit fixed something, like a wire, and sent me on my way, which always ended in the same result, it quit again!!! 

I didn't like driving the car very far, for obvious reasons, so I took it to my local car dealership about 5 times out of the 10. All the garages I went to were good garages, so I knew they were all capable of fixing my car. The last time I took the car to my local garage, they literally ran away from me saying, &quot;NOT THAT CAR AGAIN&quot;!!!! The ended up replacing many wires, my whole computer system twice and a part in the fuel system.

Since the last time I took the car in, about 2 months ago, I have not had the problem again. However, I am permanently scared from my 7 month ordeal and I get very very nervous driving the car. All in all I would definitely NOT recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
