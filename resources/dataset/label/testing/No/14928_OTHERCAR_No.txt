            I bought my '94 Sidekick about a year or two ago off of a girl for $4,000 thinking it would be a reliable vehicle. In the few years that I've had it, I can't wait to buy a car. I live in upstate New York where the weather conditions are completely unpredictable, and are usually nasty. In windy conditions it is all over the road. Its absolutely horrible for snow and ice, even with the four-wheel drive, the vehicle just slides all over. It doesn't fare well in heavy rainstorms either. I think this vehicle is best in a place of dry, uneventful weather. 

This vehicle is horrible for highway driving. Mine rattles a lot if its going over 50 mph, and it's absolutely uncomfortable to drive around 70 mph. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is due to how well it was taken care of over the years or its just normal wear and tear of it being an older vehicle, but it does rust out quite a bit, to the point where parts are falling off. I recently had the back light over the license plate fall off due to the pieces attaching it to the vehicle completely rusting out. 

I've had a few friends also be kind of wary of the bar on the dashboard on the passenger side. It doesn't seem very safe in a vehicle that is so compact. It's very very possible that if the vehicle was in an accident, the passenger would most definitely hit their face on it. 

I also had someone hit the back fender, leaving a large gaping hole in it. The fender is very cheap plastic, and very expensive to have fixed for being cheaply made. Also there tends to be a lot of smaller problems. Mine, the heat stopped working, the locks stick sometimes, and a window sticks if it's wet so you cannot roll it up.

The only really positive things about this vehicle are that it's small, making it easier for people who are smaller to drive, and it runs quite a distance on only 10 dollars a tank! Its definitely not good for the long run or in wintry conditions.
