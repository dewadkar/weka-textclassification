                   <b>L</b>ooking for a car is very hard work, especially if you want to find cheap, reliable, and smooth transportation. For the past 3 Months I have been looking for a used 2nd car without luck. It is always convenient to have another car to rely on just in case something unfortunate happens to your daily driver. Last week I came upon a 1991 Chevrolet Lumina in the paper for $700.00 bucks! That's right $700.00, with the claim that it "runs great and looks great." I called the seller immediately, went to look at the car and found that the claim in the paper was 50% true. 50% because I have never cared for the styling for the Chevy Lumina, but it did run great, relatively speaking of course (compared to other 1991 cars). Needless to say I bought the car with the odometer reading a little over 130,000 miles. 

   <b>F</b>or 1991 The Chevy Lumina comes in 3 trim lines; the base models, the Eurosport, and the Z34. 2 Body styles are also available; a 4 door sedan and a 2 door sedan/coupe.  While a 3.1 OHV V6 is available in the base models, and Eurosport, and a 3.4 DOHC V6 is standard on the Z34 my Lumina came with the base 2.5 liter SOHC 4-cylinder mated to GM's 3-speed Hydromatic automatic transmission. The 2.5 produces an anemic 105 horsepower at 4,800 RPM, and an adequate 135 lb-ft of torque at 3,200 RPM, hardly the power you want in a 3,000 Lb family sedan.

<i>Driving Impressions;</i>

     Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> comes slow, but not too painful. The engine has enough torque at a low RPM so the car will move without too much fuss. It's all about patience with this car. The 3-speed automatic should not have been in the Lumina'a transmission line-up. 4-cylinder engines coupled to 4-speed automatics make for much better gear ratioing for tackling hills, etc. The 2.5 is surprisingly smooth, at idle the Lumina is extremely quiet, giving a much more modern feel to this car's powertrain.
     

<b>Handling</b> is not really the Chevy Lumina's forte. This car does handle well for a mid-sized family car, but obvious body roll is present on any twisty road. The tires do a fair job of keeping the car planted to the road, but Chevrolet could have done much better job in this area. 


<b>Cruising</b> is probably the Lumina's strongest attribute. While the 4-cylinder mated to the 3-speed does make some noise at freeway speeds, most of this noise is isolated to the engine bay,and exhaust. The interior is well insulated so the cabin remains quiet a good percent of the time. The 1991 Lumina has a relatively soft suspension which takes bumps, and railroad tracks with ease. The 2.5 powered Lumina, although smooth and quiet most of the time, will make you hold your breath on hills. 
Hills are taken slow, and with your foot to the floor. If you hate the feeling of a 4-speed OD automatic transmission down-shifting on a hill, the sound and feel of a 3-speed automatic down-shifting from 3rd to 2nd gear on hills is 100 times worse, so you might just avoid this car for the sake of your sanity. The 2.5 Lumina does not have enough power in high gear to make it up steep grades at 70  MPH, so the transmission first jolts, and then shifts down into 2nd gear with the engine begging you to turn around.
     
<b>Braking</b> is adequate, the 4-wheel disc set-up does a good job stopping this 3,000lb machine with accurate and sure stops. 

<b>Fuel Economy</b> is also average, the Lumina 2.5 has an EPA of 21/28 MPG. I have observed 25 MPG during freeway driving with this car so far. I have to stress that these fuel economy numbers stack up to what some V8 powered cars get.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

       The <b>interior</b> of the 1991 Chevy Lumina is quite 1980's looking. The dash is plain, full of cheap plastic and dated. There is a tacky simulated wood strip that borders the middle of the dash like an equator. Ergonomics are fair, but the temperature buttons are almost out of reach from the driver. The instrument cluster is made up of a few gauges, lacking a trip odometer, tachometer, and temp gauge. The drivers position is poor, but the rear and front windows are relatively large so outward vision is excellent. The seating in my 91 Lumina is awful. Both 'full' rear and front bench seats are what was unfortunately installed (seats 6 adults). These seats offer little-no support, and they kill my back on long drives. Amenities are next to none, my base model came equipped with AC, tilt steering, and intermittent windshield wipers. My car originally came with a Cassette player, but the previous owner had replaced the stock system with an excellent sounding Alpine system (lucky me!). 
Room is  average for a car in this category, there is plenty of room up front and in the rear, but the interior design could have been made to provide much more room.

   <i>Price and Reliability:</i> 

New, a 1991 Lumina 2.5 would set you back around $14-$16K. Today these cars are going for very cheap. Although I paid $700 for mine, you most likely will find them in-between $2000-$3000. The Previous owner of the car had all the records done for repairs, I was amazed to see how reliable this car had been for her. Other than regular maintenance there had been little done to her car. At 130,000 miles, Belts, cooling hoses, brakes 3x, minor body work, 1 leaky window, 3 sets of tires, and 2 alternators had to be replaced, not too bad for an 11 year old car with 130,000 miles!
