            In 1995, my wife and I decided her old 1989 Nova was obsolete- little room, little power, ride comfort non-existant and a design that even Yugo owners would find unattractive.  We traded up to a new Saturn SL1, 1995 edition.  Compared to the Nova, our new SL1 was luxury.  Some power to spare, seats with good upolstery, decent sound system with cassete player and good gas milage.
  That was then.  Now, after 81,000 miles, two full brake jobs (the front ones the dealership mechanics couldn't stop the squeals), a new alternator and parts that are pricey due to lack of aftermarket products, our SL1 is starting to look like a '57 Chevy- nice, until you have to live and service it week in and out.
  The trade in value of our SL1 is a joke.  Although it does what I need it to do, I fear that it'll just conk out [the price of servicing the thing now is just not cost effective] while I'm far from home.  Our love affair with Saturn will be over next year if I have anything to say about it.  Our family has outgrown its design.  It's design has grown old, just as the old Nova became a dinosour.  Perhaps the Daewoo Nubira may make a great replacement as a commuter car...<br><br>
