            Not much has changed on the Mercury Villager � or any Mercury -  for the 2001 model year.   Minor styling changes to the grille and front air dam are about the only things that distinguish a 2000 Villager from a 2001.  In fact, with so many 2000s still on many dealers lots, the better deal may lie in purchasing a new 2000 model.  Rebates of up to $3000 are not uncommon.

The Mercury Villager and its twin Nissan Quest are reasonably competent minivans, but  minivans have come a long way since Chrysler introduced us to the first modern minivan in 1984, and the Villager seems a little dated when comparing to recently restyled minivans like the Dodge Caravan.  The Villager is not as roomy as some other minivans, and lacks the genius found in the king of all minivans, the Honda Odyssey. 

The Villager�s cabin is open and inviting, and the seats are comfortable enough not to notice.  Placement of certain controls such as the A/C and radio knobs seem odd and require a little bit of a reach.  Again, comparing to the Honda Odyssey, the Villager feels like a really great minivan� from 1991 � but with updated colors and textures.  It�s not bad, until you look at what else is available.  There is plenty of space, and the rear seats can be arranged in many different ways to accommodate the needs of most families.  The middle seat can be removed, and the rear seat slides back and forth on a rail.  Rear seats also fold down to expose a hard plastic, table like feature which has built in cup holders.  The Pontiac Montana�s version of this idea works a little better. Rear seating is more than adequate for children, but adults may find the middle seat a bit cramped.  The dual sliding rear doors make getting in and out easy, but reaching the rearmost seat proved to be easy only for contortionists. 

Up front, there are storage bins and drawers, but the glove box seems smaller than most.  The flip down �fisheye� mirror is very handy for keeping an eye on the kids, without having the distraction of turning around while driving.  

On the road the Villager�s handling is rather soft and prone to leaning. To improve handling, opt for the sport model and its 225/60 tires mounted on 16 in wheels.  Normally one would not expect a minivan to handle any better than a truck, but one drive in the Honda Odyssey and expectations are raised.  Acceleration is brisk in the Villager, but there is noticeable engine noise. The Ford V-6 is well suited to this vehicle, but more sound dampening could make it much quieter - at highway speeds the noise is somewhat subdued.  Brakes bring the van to a stop quickly and without worry. Steering is light and easy � perfect for parking lots.  Analog gauges are standard on all Villager models, but electronic/digital display is optional.  Unless you miss the tacky cars of the 80s, skip the electronic instrument cluster.

Loading and unloading the Villager is easy.  The rear door works both as a hatchback (glass only) and as a full door.  With all the seats in place there is little room for stuff behind the second row of seats.  Side doors are light and require little effort to open and close.  One drawback is the lack of power sliding side doors.  Not only do power  sliding doors come in handy when hands are full, but they also provide a built in safety mechanism which insures little one don�t get doors closed on them.
Overall the Mercury Villager is an average minivan � not bad, but not great either.  Many people with small families prefer the smaller size of vans like the Villager and Quest.  The problem is, Toyota and Mazda both make minivans similar in size to the Villager, and both are much better.

One final note: if you are considering a Mercury Villager over its twin, the Nissan Quest, here are some reasons to pick the Nissan. 1) longer power train warranty by 2 years. 2) the Nissan is about $200 less. 3) wood trim on dash 4) CD changer with 7 speakers vs.  Villager�s 4 speakers. 5) �S� rated tires. 

Why buy a Mercury Villager?  1) Mercury dealers are lower pressure. 2) you are snooty and want to tell your friends you bought a Mercury not a Nissan. 

 Don�t be surprised to find the Villager missing from the Mercury line up in the years to come, it just doesn�t make sense as a Mercury product.
