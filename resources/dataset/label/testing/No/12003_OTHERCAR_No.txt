            Cute, elegant, fast.  There are many ways to describe the S2000, all of which could be listed as a 'pro', all except for the price.  Its not a cheap car, with a base invoice around 32k.  However, looking at its performance, looks, and handling characteristics, the car is without doubt worth the money.

S2k a two-seater sports car, the kinds of which was only available for the rich and the famous back in the day.  With the introduction of the crude but cute Miata, your average Joe could buy a roadster and enjoy the wind blow in their face as they cruised in the highways.  Many other roadsters have popped since the introduction of the Miata in 1989, the BMW Z3 and the Mercedes 320 are some of them.  Although, these new cars hardly lacked in terms of reliability and performance like the Miata did.  The new addition to the Honda line up competes with all of these vehicles, and is priced somewhere in between the Mazda and the German cars.

S2K is not as distinctive as the Z3 or the Mercedes.  It looks a whole lot more generic, but it still manages to come across as elegant.  I personally don't like the 'shark' look of the Z3 (and forget about that ugly hatchback version!) and although I like the Mercedes, I think Honda is a better looking car.  It has a high back-end that comes together into a sharp hood that sports edgy headlights.  Its sexy and sophisticated.

Its not all looks like the Miata, though.  S2K is equiped with a 4-banger.  Ok, don't laugh.  This is possibly the only 4 banger with enough engineering to outmatch bigger engines.  How can anyone do that?  Welp, ask the engineers at Honda, for their car can rev up to an amazing 8.3K -- its total output is 240HP on an NA 4cyl car.  Possibly the fastest we will ever see.  The performance is good, but unfortunately its still not godly.  The S2K weighs about 2.8k lbs, but can only push 153lbs/ft of torque.  Although the weight is good, the torgue is outright pathetic. <i>(There is some inconsistancy with the 0-60 performance info on this car, but according to Osmurad, its 0-60 time is 5.3 scnds.  It runs 1/4 miles at 14scnds.  According to Edmunds.com, the 0-60 time is 5.8 seconds.  Anyway, looking at weight, HP, and torque ratio, we can see that this car is awesome.  But no need to fear it at a stop light, as its not the behemoth of street racing.)</i>


In any event, acceleration is not the only thing that matters when looking at fast cars.  Handling is also an important aspect, and this is where the Honda delivers the most.  Through some clever body design, Honda has managed to distribute the weight 50/50 all around the car.  This means a perfectly balanced vehicle that won't suffer from oversteering or understeering.  Zipping through the curves is a child's play with the S2K, mainly due to the superb fully independent suspension.

But anyway, don't buy this car.  Shocked?  Yeah, so was I.  The 32k MRSP is a joke, and let me explain to you why.  I went down to the Honda dealer with a friend who was seriously in love with this vehicle.  This was a few months back.  The ticket price on the car was around 39k.  Obviously this car is only worth 32k, but I am telling you its impossible for you to buy one for that price.  Through some research I found out that Honda only sold a limited amount of S2k's to its US dealers.  Somewhere around 20k?  (Someone said 5k, so that might be it.  Not sure)  It is, indeed, the great car I described it to be, and so people lined up at Honda to get it.  And guess what money loving salespeople did as a result of this; they upped the price by around 7k.  I think its unfair, and I also think what Honda is doing is unfair.  They should either release this car fully, or they should at least control that idiodic price.  They themselves admit that its only worth 32k, so why boost it up to cost as much as a Corvette?  I would much rather drive a C5 than an S2k if its going to cost me the same amount.

My advice to you is to bid your time.  If S2K continues to be a success, more of them will arrive at the US front.  The ridiculous ticket price will go down, and you will be able to get this car for a sane cost.  At the moment, its not worth the money.

<i>Addendum:</i>
I have rated this car based on its exurbant price, and some fellow enthusiasts went very far to give me some information on the latest pricing data available.  Following seems to be the most recent status (left by an anonymous):

&quot;Last fall American Honda made a half hearted effort with its dealers asking them not to engage in predatory pricing, i.e., not adding ADM (Additional Dealer Markup). (This consisted of sending dealers a letter and VCR tape wherein a Honda executive asked the dealers and salespeople not let the limited availability of the S2000 otherwise drive Honda or perspective customers away from showrooms).

Honda apparently understood the tremendous tempation for additional markups, so they countered by developing a whole host of ridiculously priced options for the car. This allows the dealers to APPEAR to be consumer friendly by not asking for additional cash. They simply say, 'we're not adding a markup, we're just putting a few options on the car'.

The result is that in the Balto/Washington D.C. area few dealers are asking for ADM but almost all are tagging on $6-$8+K of options on the car. So no, you can't get one for $32,000 + $415 delivery. They are going out the door for $38K, $39K, as high as $42K.

You might be thinking, 'gee $6K-8K for options, that might not be so bad'. Well you're not getting lots of options for that markup. Add the 'enhanced security system' and a CD disk changer (it comes stock with a great stereo/CD) and you're at $4k+ in options. Put the rear wing screen on and body kit and my, my, you're at $7K over sticker. 

As for calling American Honda. Yes, you can do that, but American Honda simply says they &quot;can't control&quot; the individual deals and what they do. What they are really saying is that both American Honda AND the dealers are swimming in cash, so why kill the goose that lays the golden egg!

The only good news in this whole mess is that the initial sizzle is indeed dying down. There are scads of used S2000s showing up for sale. And the online auctions are NOT going well. There are S2000s that have NOT met their reserve (and consequently were not sold) and there are plenty of S2000s that have not received a SINGLE bid from anyone.

If you read the &quot;for sale&quot; adds on the internet you'll find low mileage S2000s. A local dealer gave me a call on a S2000 with only 800 miles on it. The dealer sold this car a few months prior. It sat on the showroom floor for several weeks as the dealer worked through their list of inquiries until someone eventually bought it.

One of the &quot;for sale&quot; adds I recently saw seemed to sum up the situation many S2000 owners (and sellers) feel. &quot;Nice car. Just not the car for me&quot;. Translation, many owners are simply not prepared to drive the car in the aggressive manner it must be driven in order to extract maximum performance from it. Most people's tastes are for a sports car with enormous low end power.

As for myself, no surprise I'm miffed. Try as I may I have not been able to purchase this car. I've owned Hondas since 1987 and currently own 4 Honda cars and a Honda motorcycle. I followed the S2000 since it's inception as a concept car. I put my name on a local dealers 'waiting list' a year before the car was avaiable, only to have that list thrown out the door as the dealer switched to 'highest bidder'.

So no you can't get one for $32K, but yes the sizzle is indeed cooling down. &quot;<br><br>
