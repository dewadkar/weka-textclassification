            After the incredible visual and driving experience of owning the Jag XK8 convertible, I boldly walked into the dealer and ordered the turbocharged sedan.  I have now put 2500 miles on it.

Its ok.

Not a very ringing endorsement for an $70,000(plus options) car, so let me explain.

The facts that got me to buy it:
-its beautiful. The turbocharged &quot;R&quot; model has a different grill than the XJ8, Pirelli ZR 18 tires, cool alloy wheels(I had them chromed), but the same interior
-370 HP in a 4.0 litre engine (versus 290 HP for the non turbo-charged version)

-its a Ford, so I expected a better service experience than the old Jags.

-a premium Alpine sound system

-GPS navigation system

-lots of other premium toys as standard (3 memory drivers seat, integrated garage door opener, heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, on-steering wheel controls for audio system, etc)

-at the dealer's suggestion, I did not get the integrated phone.  Its not a digital phone.

What I found:
-very uneven power.  This is my major disappointment.  In sports mode, the acceleration has a huge pause, even a slight deceleration.  Then the brains in the car decide to downshift with a lurch. There is no doubt that the power, once applied is awesome.  But it feels like riding with someone just learning to use a stick shift: lurch up, lurch back.

-adequate cornering.  Wide wheelbase, 18&quot; tires, special suspension.  I expected rock-solid cornering.  While its not a marshmallow like lots of American sedans, it lacks firm handling on the corners.  A bit too much sway for my liking.

-limited headroom, even with the seat all the way down.  Being short would be an advantage for an owner of this car.

-GPS is primitive but functional.  To be fair, the salesman warned me about this, but I wanted the toy.  Here's hoping that Jag can catch up to the rest of the industry soon.

-still the old Jag turning radius.  It will turn in about the same radius as an 18 wheeler (ok, I exaggerate a bit)

-on the plus side:

-comfortable and very quiet on the highway
-great 360 degree driver's visibility (unlike the XK8 convertible)
-wonderful sound system to fill the quiet
-not one service problem so far (not even a squeak)

On balance, the incremental cost for the turbocharged version is not worth it.  The XJ8 would have all the pluses for $15k less.
