            I purchased my 4-door Sidekick in 1994 for $12,000+.  In many ways it's been a very decent small suv; dependable, useful for trucking around large dogs and running errands, and capable of good highway speed with reasonable gas mileage.

On the other hand, when it was getting near the five year payoff point, my sidekick began costing more and more for repairs.  We now have two thousand dollars + invested in it, and it yet needs the speedometer replaced (Suzuki estimated $600 just for that), and check-engine circuit replaced or fixed, despite the fact the people at the local Suzuki dealer told us the check engine light should not come on at 50,000 miles (it did).

This is expected as a vehicle ages, but parts and labor are (in my opinion) prohibitively expensive if you use &quot;authorized&quot; Suzuki repair.  If you're a do-it-yourselfer, it is not an easy vehicle to work on, and unless you're willing to use generic parts, expensive.  So far, the clutch has been done, transmission's been worked on twice, brakes (master cylinder) done, and several other less-than-minor repairs.  It looks like the air conditioner is going to need major work soon, and the control panel for the heat/ac/fan replaced.

It is not the smoothest ride in the world, although that wasn't something I cared a lot about, and there's a lot of wind noise on the highway.  

If I was ever to buy another one, I'd only do so with a plan to trade it in after 4-5 years.
