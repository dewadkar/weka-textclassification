            I own a 1991 4dr Subaru Justy with ECVT (electronic constant variable transmission).  Now don't get me wrong, I love Subaru cars and just bought a new 2000 Subaru Impreza which is wonderful, but if you buy a used car do not buy the 1991 Justy with the ECVT.  In the approximately 5 years I have owned this car it has gone through 3 transmissions.  This transmission is a joke.  They have, understandably, quit making it, but they are still out there.  I had my car into the dealer about 7 times because of this ECVT.  I was stranded 3 times because of it going out on me.  I got caught in the middle of a freeway, freewheeling down a 7% grade, and caught on a mountain road.  It just is not a reliable product.  Subaru gave me an incentive on buying my new car for all the trouble I have had with this one, which I thought was really great, but BEWARE!!!!!!! of the 1991 Justy with the ECVT.<br><br>
