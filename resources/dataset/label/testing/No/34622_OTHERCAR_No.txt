            I purchased my new Legacy L in January 2000 and have had quite a few problems with it - very surprising to me considering the reputation for quality that Subaru has.  The first problem was a check engine light that required replacement of the computer and the oxygen sensor.  I was told by the dealer this was a common problem on 2000 Legacys.  Other problems included an out of round tire, an improperly shifting transmission and a ping in the engine on acceleration, none of which the dealer would repair.  

On the plus side, the AWD traction is great in snow and mud, especially on hills.  A word of caution, though, do not drive very fast in a rainstorm, as this car is prone to hydroplaning.  The quality of the ride and handling is very good, and once I got used to the seat, long distance travel was not a problem.

I am looking to trade out of this car because I do not trust its long term reliability, but I like the AWD enough that I may trade it for a different model of Subaru.<br><br>
