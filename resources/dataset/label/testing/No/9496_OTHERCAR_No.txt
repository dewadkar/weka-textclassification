            My 1994 Dodge 1500 SLT shortbed has an automatic, 5.1 V8 and all the goodies.  I bought this vehicle to pull my pontoon boat.  It does an average job, but so did my Toyota 4 cylinder.  It has been a maintenace nightmare.  I have replaced the following items; Water pump, radiator, thermostat (4) times, upper and lower radiator hoses, fan belt. starter, &amp; battery (twice).  The seats are falling apart at the seams, the door rubber gaskets above the door have rotted away, The paint on the hood and top has turn to a sandy texture and peeled away (the truck is red).  Gas mileage is around 10 mpg.  The AM/FM cassette deck quit working and when I removed it there was a sticker showing it has been repaired before.  The parking brake lever will not engage, cruise control works sometime, The cigarette lighter quit working,the passenger window only works from the drivers controls,and the passenger seat sometimes comes unlocked and slides forward.  The back of the truck is very light and I have been stuck twice is my own driveway in just plan dirt.  I hate this truck and am getting rid of it.  There are a few good things about it though.  The A/C is fantastic and here in Florida its great.  The brakes are great, now with 118,000 miles on it it still makes me feel safe to drive it.  Someone whom likes putting money into a vehicle should buy a Ram, Ram Tough, what a good sales slogan.  I'll buy a used Chevy from now on.<br><br>
