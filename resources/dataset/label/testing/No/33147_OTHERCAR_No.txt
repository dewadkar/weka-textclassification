            I bought my 2000 Malibu LS a year ago.  My Malibu has 30,000 miles and I have had nothing but problems with it since day one!

My malibu has been in the shop so many times I've lost count.  Some of the Mechanical examples of the work done is:

Rotors/brakes replaced 3 times in one year- the first time when I only had 10,000 miles on the car!

Loud ticking engine noise when car is started and sitting- from reading reviews of other owners I have heard that it is the pistons- when I've brought it back to the dealership I was told that this is normal and there is not a problem!

Fan- my fan for my heat/ac broke after 18K miles and I needed to drive around for a week without heat until the dealership could take my car in.

Tail lamp needed to be replaced after it started to fall out after 1 week of owning car

Moonroof- seal needed to be replace after 1 month- started to leak.

Wiper control arm- need to be replaced

I could keep going but basically I've learned that you get what you pay for. 
The inside of the car is cheaply made and looks cheap.  The leather seats are cheap leather seats and are very uncomfortable on long rides- I took the car on a 6 hours road trip and after an hour the seats become uncomfortable where as I took the same trip in a Honda Accord (4 cylinder) and only needed to stop twice.
The fuel capacity is 15 gallons and after driving the car back and forth to work two days in a row (around 125 miles) I need to fill the car back up.  

I am now trading my car in for a Toyota and taking a $4000 loss.  I would rather take the loss and know that I am getting a car that I can actually drive without worrying about the car falling apart.  

If you want the Malibu I would say spend the extra money and buy an extended warranty by GMC....you'll need it!

I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone- if you are on a budget- get a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic- you'll pay extra money for the Toyota or Honda but save it in the trips and cost of constantly going to the dealership with the Malibu!!!!!

Do not trust the test drive!  The car was wonderful on the test drive but after breaking the car in (about 2000 miles) I started having to make my constant weekly treks back to the dealership for repairs- and the service is unfriendly and never fixes the problem on the 1st or 2nd time a car is brought back- you need to bring the car in about 3 times before they fix the problem!
