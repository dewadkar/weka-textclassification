            <b>Intro</b>
I've got mixed feelings with my '99 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport.  On one hand, it's a hoot to drive (when it's on the road...more on that later) - It grips the road tenaciously, even in the wet.  Its structural rigidity is superb, and cabin room is fine in the front.  It could've been the perfect car for me, except...

<b>Problems.  Lots and lots of problems</b>
At less than 15k miles, I lost a wheel bearing.  Then several of them.  Since purchasing my vehicle, its lost 11 wheel bearings, which have violently exploded at highway speeds, causing me to maneuver the car off-road while avoiding accidents.  This happened 5 times out of the total number that went.  I do not feel safe in this car.

<b>Denial.</b>
Subaru of America officially does not state that there is a problem with wheel bearings.  It's well-known that rear wheel bearings on 1999-2001 (or even earlier) are known to go.  Their work-around is to use a part off of a Subaru Legacy to repair the problem.  They will not acknowledge this is a safety problem with the vehicle; they put their agenda ahead of driver safety.

<b>Genuinely Fun-to-drive when it's not getting bearings replaced.</b>
When the vehicle isn't getting bearings/hub assemblies replaced, it's a hoot to drive.  It handles well with a larger Subaru rear sway bar in the rear and better tires.  It provides a sense of driver confidence that is only obliterated when the driver's side rear wheel bearing explodes.

<b>Stay away, unless you know the car has Legacy Rear Wheel Bearings</b>
If you're in the market for one of these cars on the used market, make 100% sure that the car has Legacy rear wheel bearings on it.  SOA will not acknowledge that there is a legitimate problem, but many District Managers have told local dealerships about the problem.  If you can get the rear wheel bearings dealt with, you'll have one hell of a fun and otherwise reliable vehicle to get you through the slick and wet stuff.
