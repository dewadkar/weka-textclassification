            I decided to retire my old, worn out digital camera. I made the mistake of wandering into a store, credit card in hand with a dreamy look in my eyes. I DID get a great camera, but this is way more camera that I NEEDED. 

Make no mistakes; the Cannon PowerShot G2 is a great piece of technology. I have had absolutely NO problems with it, the batteries last a very long time and I have figured out almost all of the features (a small miracle considering I still can't program my VCR). However, this camera is not for someone who wants to take simple shots. The megapixels are impressive, rendering pictures which look like they could almost come alive. The camera has both digital and optical zoom. 

The problem is not with the camera, I am afraid. No folks this is a clear case of my eyes being bigger than my wallet. I paid a lot of money for this camera, and I have not used it to its full potential. If your primary use for a camera is to a take pictures at family functions, or to capture the nature scenes on a hike, take my advice and scale it down a bit. I would have been fine with fewer megapixels and less zoom capabilities and I may have saved myself enough money to buy a second film media (4 megapixel pictures take up lots of space I have found.) 

If you are a pro, or even a very serious amateur, then get this one. It is great. However, if you are a weekend photo junkie like myself, scale it down
