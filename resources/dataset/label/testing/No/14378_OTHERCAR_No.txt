            My 98 Catera was getting fixed (again!) and I got a 2000 DeVille as a loaner for the day.
I paid $12/day for insurance and another $8/day for gas for a total of $20/day for the car.

Everything about this car is SMOOTH, I liked:
* smooth, powerful, quiet v8
* smooth, quiet ride
* built in compass
* good elbow support (the Catera has very poor support)
* very comfortable - could fall asleep while driving!
* trip computer - this is very useful if you remember to reset the gas usage before you drive off, you'll know exactly how much to fill up when returning to the nearest 0.1 gallon and avoid overfilling
* good elbow support in the center

I disliked:
* huge blind spots - could those C pillars in the back be any thicker?
* cars with such large blind spots should come with convex mirrors built into the side & rear view mirrors
* very small rear window - what's up with that, there should be a law for the minimum height for a rear window in a passenger car!
* passenger side climate control was strange - only subjective bars indicating the amount of heating/cooling - why cannot they put a temp setting like the driver's control? (the Catera has identical temp controls for the driver & passenger)
* poor mileage - about 17-18 mpg average on combination driving
* no express up on the windows (the Catera has express up & down on ALL 4 windows)
* the lumbar support on the seats was poor and you tend to slide around a bit when cornering even while using seat belts!
* no radio seek button on the wheel (there were buttons for volume & preset stations)
