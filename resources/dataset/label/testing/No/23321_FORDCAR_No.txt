            big mistake buying a Taurus!  At almost 80,000 miles the air conditioner went out... soon after that the transmission went out cost me big to get it replaced.  I went w/ a special kit to fix FORD'S mistake....
If you ask me we should all get a class action law suit against Ford and Sue them!
Don't buy! If you bought it get rid of IT SOON!
BTW I have a 85 Toyota Camry w/ over 270,000 miles on it with no problem!!

Oh, and the interier is falling apart too.

nice power and good ride, but not worth the repairs

what is the fewer than a 100 words JUNK...
