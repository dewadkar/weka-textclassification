            A couple of years ago, my husband and I needed a car. We could not afford a new car, so we bought a used 1991 Limited edition Buick Regal. That was the biggest mistake we could have made. I hate this car! Sure it has a big engine and will fly down the road, that is when it is running! In the past 2 years, we have almost rebuilt this car.A new engine, because the engine blew up, a new starter block, the power windows stick and will not roll down, the power antanea will not come up- you have to pull it up. The starter has went bad twice. The driver's side door handle broke off, the paint is chipping off. That is not too mention the regular repairs that a car needs.The alternator went out a couple of times, the fuel injector, the intake valves. Everything short of the transmission has been replaced. Now there is a probem with the computer.If my father did not rebuild cars I would be in the por house because of this car. I would NEVER by a Buick again. Very high mantinence and very costly.  <br><br>
