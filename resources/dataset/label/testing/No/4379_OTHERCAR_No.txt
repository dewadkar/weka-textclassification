            The Kia Sportage is an SUV without hope.  Small, powerless, whiney, and cheap, the Sportage reeks of bad econobox.  SUVs should provide passengers with ample legroom and comfort, while offering a decent amount of power and size.  The Kia failed being an SUV.  Driving the tiny four wheel drive vehicle was a precarious task.  The engine was too small, leaving the Kia underpowered and gasping for an increase in acceleration.  Rush hour city driving is tedious with no "get up and go."  When cornering, be careful to heed the warnings on the visor; the Kia is top heavy, and may tip if pushed into corners too aggressively.  The only advantage to having a small engine is its lack of "gas thirst."  The Kia is a master of minimizing petroleum intake.  The interior of the hopeful SUV is also lackluster.  The seats feel cheap, and space is at a minimum.  Anyone who happens to measure more than 5'10" shouldn't consider sitting in the back seat, unless knee problems are a good thing.  The interior's cloth pattern was also tacky looking.  The Sportage can hold a relatively large amount of luggage; a family of four, lugging six large suit cases could fit in the car with minor discomfort.  The radio and tape player are decent and provide enough sound for most people.  Most importantly, the Sportage is a car lacking character.  It is a wannabe SUV which can't climb hills.  If a Kia and a kitten were to fight, my money would be on the kitten.
