            This was my first Digital camera so I did quite a bit of research. Unfortunately, Pic quality is not everything as I found out. The camera is really cool and takes great pics but the viewer is a bad place. By that I mean that whenever I take a picture I leave a nose print on the LCD screen. It's also a drag to have to slide the lens protector back and forth to turn it on and off. One other big time bummer is that it doesn't come with an AC adapter. Fortunately, I have a SmartMedia reader so I don't have to drain my batteries while downloading pics. One other thing...The manual is a damn shame. It looks as if somebody that was about to go on vacation wrote it. I can't recommend this camera because I'm not in love it it...I just own it. It wasn't a waste of money but If I know then what I know now I would have bought something else. Hope this helps. 

P.S. The batteries...It takes 4 AA batteries and it consumes them like mad. Invest in rechargeable is all I can recommend.
