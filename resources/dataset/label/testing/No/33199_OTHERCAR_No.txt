            In 1995-1996 while TDY to Naples Italy I rented an Opel, I can't remember what it was called now, but it was an Opel!  Anyway the car was nice for long trips, somewhat loud, it didn't have very good pickup, but it was great on the Autobahn...  I thought to myself I wonder why they don't sell this in the States?

Anyway last year my mother purchased a new car and when she called me and told me what it was all I could think of was "She's got the OPEL"!!!  

During the first 8K miles of ownership (about 10 months) she'd had this car in the shop approximately 14 times.  She'd contacted the dealer, GM, the NC State Attorney General and she couldn't get any help in getting this clunker fixed.  I got involved and wrote a letter in an attempt to get this thing fixed or get a new car under the Lemon Laws of NC.  GM responded by having another dealer from 45 miles away come and pick the vehicle up.  They brought the car back to her after about 21 days saying that they couldn't find any problems (this was the 15th time in 8 months the car had been in the shop).  The car ran great for about 6 more months and she decided to keep it (I don't know why since she had the law on her side, but that's another story).  

I called her earlier this week and she told me that the thing started smoking, and fluid was pouring out of it.  She's now driving a Cadillac provided loaner (Jeep Grand Cherokee!!!) and waiting on the dealer to return her car.  This time she told me that as soon as they return it she's trading it for something else.  Maybe she'll get the Lincoln this time!  Now I know why they stopped selling Opels in the US years ago.
