            Let me start with the fact that I am somewhat of a car nut. We have had an SUV before they called them that(1976 Blazer). We have owned Honda, Audi, Porsche, Benz, BMW, Lincoln, Cadillac, you name it. We traded in our 1999 Ford Expedition, Eddie Bauer, for better gas mileage and a non-truck SUV. I bought this car for my wife and kids last July with every option other than the cell phone...All wheel drive, Navigation, DVD, Intermezzo sound system, Leather interior, headlight upgrade, the works. I was a little skeptical with the fact that Chrysler now has a 41k vehicle and hoped they knew how to deal with that, so I took the plunge! I definitely have mixed feelings about this purchase 5,000 miles into it. The gas mileage is HORRIBLE!! They state 17/24....we get 13.5 AVERAGE! The dealer says it has to "break in"...yeah right! Come on Chrysler, a little honesty here! It's a sled at 4700lbs w/AWD, so I guess that has a lot to do with it, BUT, 13.5 mpg! Gas pedal feel is very numb, as is the excelleration . It needs a V-8 to combat this, 6 cyl. doesn't cut it at this weight. Lanes changes on the highway are an adventure, give yourself plenty of room to perform this task! Build quality is a little suspect...we have had the air vent adjusters fall off 2 vents as well as other assorted plastic pieces that just "popped" off! The carpeting is of a very poor quality as are the tiny little mats, $40,000.00 car!. I have already bought aftermarket mats(all three rows),rear carpeted tray and a rear bumper top cover(all Chrysler offerings) to protect it from scrapes and scratches. The gas tank sensors have broken twice, the speedo once, and the 2 leaks in the front end(tranny fluid) had the vehicle out of service for 2 weeks...had to remove the lower drivetrain, transfer case, and jack the engine to reach one of them! BUT, we had a loaner car the whole time so kudos to Chrysler on customer support. Oh, I forgot to mention NOT to open the sunroof all the way(pushing the "open" button a second time) because it will blow out your eardrums with the wind percussion!...and the keyfob that everyone raves about, be careful not to put it in your pocket/pocketbook too close to the car, it is very easy to hit the auto tailgate button and open the rear up. A few times we walked back to the car after going into a store only to see the rear hatch open! Seats are comfortable, heated for the winter, kids play video games on the DVD as well as movies, somewhat easy access to the rear third row seats that fold down easily. The Auto-Stick is pretty cool for a car of this sort, lets you play a little! It just snowed today (NJ:12/6/03) and this thing tracked and held the road VERY well, even with the Michelin road tread tires(AWD). On the icy roads the brakes worked flawlessly, no lock-up or fade. It had a great road feel in the bad weather, no sweaty palms, total control.
