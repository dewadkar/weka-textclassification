            This car is a hand-me-down from my mom, which she gave me about 4 years ago, right after my college graduation. It's a semi-luxury car and drives smoother and quieter than the Millenia. The engine also seems to have more power than the Millenia and the 626 combined.  The interior is nice--soft leather interior, good sound system, power everything. The engine is zippy and very responsive and ride is smooth and quiet. Now, those are the nice things about this car.

Let's get to some of the bad things about my car...

My car has defective paint. The paint chips off all the time and there is nothing I can do about it, unless I want to spend hundreds of dollars getting my car repainted. It didn't bother my mom, but by the time I got the car in my hands, it was out of warranty.

The Mazda 929 is rear wheel drive. What does that mean in everyday terms? It's a death trap in bad weather. I'm not kidding. When I drive in the snow in this car, I take my life into my own hands, even with all weather tires. The car slips, and slides and does 360's in the snow. And in the rain? We lost control on a turn and spun out head on into a brick wall. Thank God, everyone was fine because we were all wearing our seat belts, and my car was almost totalled (the repair shop fixed it up to almost new condition).  In addition, the air bag NEVER POPPED even though it was a 45 mph head on collision with a brick wall on the highway. Go figure. I spoke to Mazda after the accident and they told me that the air bag was out of warranty. Now, unless you're in an accident, how are you supposed to figure out if the air bag is supposed to work or not? 

This car is very expensive to fix. I tried getting simple tuneup's at the local Pep Boys and they ended up breaking things in the transmission--I then had to haul the car over to the Mazda dealership who then charged me $3 grand to get things fixed. 

The headlights on the car suck. If I drive in a low lit area, the headlights are no help at all. In fact, when I drive with both headlights AND foglights, it's like normal headlights in a regular car. I've tried everything, including changing the bulbs, but the car doesn't get any brighter. 

Right now the car has close to 100K miles on it, and it runs decently. I've learned my lesson and drive a different car in bad weather. It's okay for trips to the supermarket, but I never bring the car out when the sun isn't shining. If you own or plan to own a 929, make sure you get the airbags checked, because you never know!<br><br>
