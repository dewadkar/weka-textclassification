             I purchased this car used last year(October 2000). At first I really liked the car,despite the dorky first impression, and the paint beginning to flake, because it ran decently(at first),had plenty of power, had a very comfortable interior(despite cheap looking upholstery and plastics used) and conviently located controls, and the price was dirt cheap. However, in Febuary of this year(01), it somehow reached a quite sudden expiration date at 130 thousand miles. Before the month was over, the radiator hose busted, it started breaking down at least 5x a week, the headliner caved in completly, the turn signals suddenly stopped doing anything, suspension gave out completly so I was bottoming out over the tiniest bumps and dips in the road, the breaks failed, some of the console stopped lighting up, transmission started acting up, a door handle fell off in my hand, the paint that was just beginning to flake when i first bought it ended up completly vanishing off the roof, and to top it all off.... ohmygod...I could scream... the clasp/hook- whatever it is that secures the hood down somehow failed and my hood flew up and completly crushed in the windsheild... so I slammed on my breaks and got rear-ended! Needless to say this is the worst car in the world, I would not wish this car on my worst enemy and I seriously discourage anyone from going near one of these unless you would like to see an example of the worst American car ever crafted. I have done plenty of reaserch on this via internet and found all of these problems to be common- just not as many simultaneously and sudden as mine.
