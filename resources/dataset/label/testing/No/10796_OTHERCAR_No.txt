            I am in the market for a good used passenger car. This past weekend (December 2000), I was out looking at used cars and came across a 1994 Eagle Vision in one lot.
It was eggplant purple (a really attractive color for this car), was fully loaded with every available option including leather powered seats for both the driver and passenger, CD player, power windows...etc.
Under the hood, the engine compartment was so clean you could've eaten a meal off the engine. Even the belts were so new you would swear the car hadn't been driven more than a mile. The mileage on the car was 84,000 and they were asking $6800.00 for what was obviously at one time, a $25,000 car new.
There wasn't even a wearmark on the seats, a telltale sign of how well the car was maintained and how often it was driven.
When I test drove the car, it performed like a champ, and I was impressed by the power of the V6 3.5 24 valve engine.
Sounds great doesn't it?
It did to me. I was certainly hot and excited to buy this car.
Before taking the final step of having a diagnostic done on the car at AAA before purchase, I decided to go online to see what other people had to say about the car, and if it was reliable and such.

Well my friends, I can't find even one favorable opinion on the internet about the Eagle Vision! 

 One review was simply titled &quot;Great car if you like repair shop coffee&quot;. Another said &quot;Owning a Chrysler product is the best reason to buy Toyota&quot;  A third said &quot;Don't buy this car!&quot;

Here is one reviewers comments:

These things have failed SO FAR: Water pump, transmission cooling lines, air emissions pump, head gaskets, timing belt tensioner, steering rack, A/C condensor, A/C electronics, antilock ABS braking controller, fuel pump, fuel hoses, power antenna, ventilation motors, suspension snubbers have fallen off and brake rotors warp. Various driveline fluid leaks. Numerous water/air leaks, body creaks. 

3 recalls: Fuel injector rail leaks (failed), suspension cracking, driver's seat frame failures. 
The engine pulleys tend to throw belts. 
The wipers float an inch above the windshield at 70 mph. 
The headlamps have poor seals allowing condensation to occur and have dim illumination. 
The car has a lot of road noise at speed. 
The trunk and doors do not stay open on inclines and may close on arms, heads or legs. 
Other owners are reporting structural and frame failures as well as transmission failures. 
Some of these cars have caught fire. 

A second reviewer said:

Air conditioning thermostat went out, water pump went out causing car to overheat and warp heads. Front wheel bearing, head gasket failure, transmission slipping, vehicle will stall after prolonged driving at highway speeds when you come to a stop. Generally runs hot. Been in for a service at dealership more times than I can remember.

Here is a list of the recall history just for starters:


1993 
  - Lower control arm washers in front suspension of some cars can crack and fall off; will cause clunking sound during braking, and eventually result in loss of steering control.  
  - (w/3.3-liter engine) O-rings used to seal interface of fuel-injector tubes are insufficiently durable; deterioration can cause fuel leakage, with potential for fire.  
1994 
  - Right tie rod can rub through automatic-transmission wiring harness, causing short circuit; may result in stalling, or allow engine to start when selector is not in &quot;Park&quot; position.  



Trouble Spots 

Automatic transmission 
Bad seals in the transmission lead to premature friction component wear, which causes shudder when starting from a stop, a bump when coasting to a stop, and slipping between gears. (1993-95)  
Automatic transmission 
41TE or 42LE automatic transaxle could take several seconds to engage at startup because of a problem with the valve body. (1993-95)  
Air conditioner 
The air conditioner belt rolls over in the pulleys and replacement belts do the same. The fix is to replace the A/C pulley and idler pulley. (1993-94)  
Automatic transmission 
A defective throttle positions sensor, not a transmission problem, could be the cause of late, erratic, or harsh shifting. (1994)  
Engine noise 
The motor mount on the left side of the engine tends to break. (1992-93)  
Automatic transmission 
If the transmission shudders under light to moderate acceleration, the transmission front pump could be leaking due to a worn bushing. (1993-96)  
Hard starting 
Hard starting and a miss at idle can be traced to defective fuel rails. (1993-94)  


THANK GOODNESS FOR RESOURCES LIKE THE INTERNET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I almost got hooked into buying a really crappy car that would've caused me undue pain, lost time, and a bundle of money on repairs. Thanks to other netizens I will be saved the aggravation and disappointment of owning a genuine Eagle.

I just hope my commentary will help someone else who might consider this vehicle.
