            I bought my 1996 Dodge Neon a few years ago thinking is was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Boy was I wrong!  Although it is a very "cute" car and has a sporty feel to it, which is the reason why I bought it, I believe it is a badly made vehicle.  I have had a lot of work done to it in the past few years and it still needs to be fixed!  I can't help but think I am driving a junker around even though it is only 6 years old.

Do you want to know what's so wrong with it?  Well, I'll tell you.  First, I had to get the oil gasket replaced at 35,000 miles and it still leaks!  Second, the transmission fluid leaks and nobody really knows why.  Third, every time I put my foot on the brakes, they squeal!  I have asked about this several times to my mechanic and I have been told to just put some anti-squeak oil on them.  Well, that wears off after a short while as I live in a rainy area.  I shouldn't have to do that just to make my brakes stop squeaking.  The noise is unbearable at times!  It can be so embarrassing. UPDATE~ The brakes still squeal...ack!  We had the whole brake system redone because the rotors went out.  Spent $500 to fix the brakes and they still make super loud noises.  Nothing works to keep them from making these nasty noises.   I'll be happy to get rid of this car...ANOTHER UPDATE- The brakes still sound awful, especially when it's wet or cold outside.  And we just had them checked again... there are in good condition.  So why do they squeak?  No one seems to know.  

The fourth thing that went wrong was with the wiring system.  Each time I would turn my lights on, one of them would dim and the blinker would blink like crazy when I was turning a corner.  And if I tried to use the brights, the light would go off completely!  Scary!  Thank goodness that my husband knew how to fix that or that would have been another big expense for us.

Well, now we are to number five.  The transmission is starting to have problems.  Sometimes when I stop to make a turn, it shifts out of gear and DOESN'T want to go back in to drive.  I have to floor it to get it to move.  This is embarrassing also as sometimes there are a lot of people in back of me waiting for me to make my turn.  In my opinion, a car with only 60,000 miles on it shouldn't be having transmission problems just yet! UPDATE~  We got this fixed shortly after it's problems and haven't had to worry about it since.  Now we are at 82,000 miles, but the service engine light just came one.  I'm hoping it's nothing major....

UPDATE-  The speedometer went out.  My husband got a ticket because of it too.  Thankfully, the ticket was dropped when we got it fixed.  This was around 87,000 miles.
Also, the paint is flaking off the roof of the car revealing the primer.  Ugh, I feel like we own a beater.  I will never own another Dodge vehicle!  And to top it off, we've heard the trade-in value is around $800.  And that's high!  So now I have no idea when we are going to be able to get rid of this lemon of a car.  I would not feel right selling it to some unsuspecting teenager and there is no one I know that I would even want to give it away to.  It's really that bad.  And it's too bad since it's such a sporty, nice looking car (until now).  With paint peeling off the top, it looks like it came from a wrecking yard.  

Now that I've said some of the things wrong with my Dodge Neon, I'll go on to say what I like about it.  It is very peppy and I like the fact that I can get up to speed after I make a turn or a stop.  It makes me feel like I'm driving a sports car.  It gets very good gas mileage too.  I never have to spend more than sixteen dollars to fill it up.  I also like the fact that it says it's on empty, but gives you an extra 2 gallons after that in the gas tank.  You'll never run out of gas in this car.  This makes an excellent commuter car if you can handle the squeaky brakes, the trips to the mechanic and if you don't mind the seats.  I bought my husband a massaging seat cover for his to help with the comfort.
