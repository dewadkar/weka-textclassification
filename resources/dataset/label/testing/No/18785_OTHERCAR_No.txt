            I bought my 1997 Kia Sephia only a few months ago.  Being a college student with a tight budget, I didn't have much to spend and managed to get a good deal on a not-too-old car with decent mileage.  While Kia did NOT pay a lot of attention to the finer details with the Sephia, I can't say I've had any major problems with the car other than discomfort.

Don't expect a smooth ride if you're gonna buy the Sephia...the shocks are horrible and you can definitely feel it on your first ride in the car.  The rough suspension leads to having to replace your tires a little more often than normal (I just replaced two of mine).  The body squeaks and creaks a little also, especially at high speeds.  

I only use the car occasionally, however, and I find that it gets the job done, so for the price I paid I'm not complaining.  The gas mileage is great.  Four years old, my car gets 26 miles to the gallon.  The engine sounds and feels great for a car with over 80,000 miles on it.

Basically, if you need a car for long, daily commutes, look elsewhere.  Otherwise, for what you're paying, the Kia is a great for someone who needs a sedan to occasionally get around.
