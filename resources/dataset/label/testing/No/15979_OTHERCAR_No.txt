            I rented this vehicle after my car accident.  It was one of the best avaliable. The car is OKAY but I definetely wouldn't purchase it.


Pros:

1.Very Roomy.  Could easily sit 3 in the back with lots of head and leg room.
2.Comfortable. The seats are actually livable.
3.Smooth Ride.   I felt like I was in a luxury car.
4.Convience.  Cupoholders and compartments everywhere.
5.Power It has a really good pick up.

Cons:

1.Gas Mileage.  Yuck!  I set the trip and for 3 gallons only got a max of 40 miles.
2. Automatic Shifter Placement.  It never failed, everytime I put the car into park I hit the window wipers.
3. Road Handling.  It steered awful. Not sensitive at all. Parking was a chore.

The year I drove was a 1994 and it had 60,000 miles on it. I don't know anything about the newer models but I definetely see room for improvement.
