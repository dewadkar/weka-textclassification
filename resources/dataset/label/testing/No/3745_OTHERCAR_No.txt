            Purchased my 2000 Silverado in August of 1999. After being a loyal Dodge owner for many years and was convinced after my 1998 Dodge Ram 1500 its was time for a change ( way to many problems). Currently have 22,416 on this pickup with transmission problems, passenger back window leaks air &amp; water, under powered, stalling, response problems. To squirrely! Brakes are unpredictable too. Does not want to stop when you want to. And god forbid should you hit a bump coming to a stop. Those anti-locks will certainly kick in. Also will be replacing tires to (Goodyear tires Suck!!)I know this from several of my service vehicles. The ride in this truck is like a rock also. No forgiveness here on the roads in Texas. It is no wonder why Americans are gearing towards foreign vehicles for value. It will take a long time for me to be convinced that American makers are designing and building better and more reliable vehicles. Owning a service company with service vehicles gives me first hand knowledge of what works or does not work. As time goes on, vehicles get more expensive but the quality is long gone.<br><br>
