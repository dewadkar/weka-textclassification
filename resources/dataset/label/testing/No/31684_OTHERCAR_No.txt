            I decided to buy my Pontiac Grand Prix because I loved the body style and the features that came with it for the price I was getting.  It was one of the worst decisions of my life.  The car gets terrible gas mileage, no one but a mechanic can work on one, and is terribly uncomfortable to ride in for long periods of time.  Something is ALWAYS going wrong with this car, whether it be the brakes, the alternator, or something equally vital to the cars performance.  The only person who should buy this car is a young adult with no children, a lot of money for repairs, and no reason to take long road trips.  I wish I had something more positive to add, but Pontiac really needs to work on this one.<br><br>
