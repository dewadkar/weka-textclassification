            I was in the market for a used car and I have always wanted a VW. So when a passat came up in the paper I went to look at it. I was very surprised at the roominess in both the front and back seats, as well as the huge trunk.
It was also very comfortable and fun to drive, which is important to me. It had 150,000 miles on it, and it was just right for the money I had available. Unfortunately, I didn't take it to a mechanic before I purchased it, and that seems to be my mistake.

The problems started not long after I bought the car. First the little emissions control sensor light started coming on. After replacing several parts, the mechanic still can't seem to find what's causing it. Then it has an ongoing problem of the battery draining. I've replaced the battery, and the alternator, as well as several other parts trying to fix that. I replaced gaskets, hoses, the thermostat, a front tie rod, and more. Most recently I replaced an injector which was preventing it from starting when it was cold. All this in the space of a year. As most VW owners know, taking your car in for anything is expensive, but the parts on this car seem really expensive.

However, there are lots of things I like about the car. It's very roomy, even in the back seat. It has good acceleration and excellent handling. I love the sunroof. The trunk is huge, and the back seats lay down also, providing plenty of room for my friends and my snowboards. It's front wheel drive, so it does good in the snow. Although I wished it got better gas mileage, because I drove 8 hours straight in it for a trip once, and it was very comfortable.

I'm not sure if I just happen to get a lemon, or if others have lots of problems, but I would say get your car checked at a good mechanic before buying. If my car was in good running condition, it would be a great car.
