            I just got back from a week long summer trip to Fort Lauderdale FL where I had the opportunity to rent a Z24 Cavalier Conv.  I was a little upset when the Alamo guy handed me the keys to this car when I had expected to receive a Sebring Conv.  But, since I had many miles to trek to get to Miami, and on to check out the keys I loaded up and off I went.

Within no time I realized the hidden potential of this vehicle.  I am mostly a foreign car market consumer so my faith in the Chevy line is low.  My expectations of this vehicle were proven wrong in how quick it zipped along I 95, how well it steered Las Olas and A1A, and a number of other factors.

First the speed.  Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this car was its speed.  It has just about as much punch as my friend's Nissan Z (Sorry Will) and its only a four cylinder.  I had to see for myself if it was really only a four by popping the hood.  I was shocked to see how much engine was crammed into such a small vehicle.  

The only downside I saw to this was expensive tuneups and difficult oil changes.  The enormous 2.4 liter block filled up so much space you could barely see through to the ground.  

I timed it on I95 and was shocked even further to get 60 mph in almost 6 or 7 seconds.  Yes, we are still talking about a 4 cyln.  Along with such speed a vehicle needs great handling.  I turned wet corners with such speed I though I was surely going to lose control.  The Cavalier gripped the asphalt like it was attached to a monorail.  

Another great thing about this car is its fuel consumption.  In my constant slamming of the gas pedal I barely moved the needle.  In fact, I only had to refill the car once after driving all over Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, and the Keys.  

A few things I saw that could use improvement were the sound system, and the roof leaked a tiny amount.  But, then again this was a rental.  Besides leaking the roof rattled too much when hitting bumps in the road.
 
Some cool things about the car were the way the radio wouldn't cut off until you opened the door to get out (even after removing the key) and the auto power down driver side window.<br><br>
