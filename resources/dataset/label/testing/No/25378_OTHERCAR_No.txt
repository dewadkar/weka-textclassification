            Okay, this was the first camera that i bought. I didnt know anything about digital cameras before i had gotten this one.
First, i must say that the CL30 Clik! is a good camera, but if you are looking for something quick and that takes good quality pictures at night this is NOT the camera for you.
I guess the only good thing is that the camera has a 40MB Clik! disk, and it comes with 3 of them. I think that is a really good deal. It also comes with an AC adapter and a USB cable. I think its a great camera for beginners, but i think later on you will realize that the quality in the pictures isn't all that great.
I take pictures at parties/clubs, and as we all know, the room at a party is mostly dark. I tried to take pictures of the crowd and the pictures came out dark, and not very clear. My boyfriend has an Olympus D460 and he also takes pictures with me, and HIS pictures came out clear and bright! This made me kind of upset so i decided to change and get myself a better quality camera. I switched over to the Toshiba PDR-M60 and i am very pleased with it.
The CL30 Clik! also takes about 11 seconds until the LCD works after you turn it on. For the first 11 seconds all you see on the LCD screen is a white background with "AGFA" in red. This gets really annoying because if you wanna take a picture of something quickly you have to WAIT until the afga display goes away.
The LCD screen on the camera is VERY SLOW!!! as you look at the LCD while moving the camera is takes a while for it to catch up. This is also a very annoying feature. Other (better) digital cameras have an LCD that is as quick as a camcorder.
I think its a cool camera, but i will not suggest buying it for $450, it's simply not worth it. I got it for $199, but then sold it to my brother and got myself the PDR M60 with 2.3 megapixels compared to the AGFA 1.3 megapixels. I am more pleased with my new camera rather than the AGFA.
