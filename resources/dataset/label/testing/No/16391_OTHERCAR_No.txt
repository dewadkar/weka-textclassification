            I love the cl-class mercedes.  At first I was looking for a gift to spoil myself with since I am retireing soon and it hit me.  Why not endulge yourself in a little luxury and some style.  <br>  First thing came to mind was a mercedes benz.  I went to the car and there was so many to choose from.  Then I just looked for a color that stands out.  I want to be seen whenever I am on the road.  Then there it was the E-320 in a shiney black.  I first sat in the car and the feel of the leather and looking at the luxurous wood grain material made me fall in love even before I test drove the car.  <br>  <br>  Then I went for a spin and it was all over.  Cruising along H-1,  I am finding that this is the best ride I've ever taken in a car.  The car handled without a doubt, the best I've ever seen in a car.  Every turn I took was with an ease.  The ecceleration was powerful enough to make me no longer think that I needed a sports car for speed.  I had the same feeling as being in front of a big screen television in my favorite recliner with the romote control in my lap after a long day at work.  <br>  <br>  I gotta say that I was convinced after 5 minutes of driving and an hour of negotiating.<br><br>
