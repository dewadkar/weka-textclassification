            OK, it's with some mixed opinions that I write this review, that is to say that the Chevy Lumina as a whole isn't such a bad car, but it's when you add all the little design quirks that the car drives you mad.

I really must say that the design team for this car must have been a bunch of geeks, the cars frame, and the controls and layout inside kind of remind me of that "Car of Tomorrow" 50's cartoon, I'll go into a detailed list of things I like, and hate about this car below.

1. The Ride

Well, you won't be disappointed here, not by the suspension anyway, or by engine power, it feels like you're driving a frigging tank, course, I absolutely loathe going more than about 50 miles in it, because some brightbulb at Chevy thought it'd be a great idea to use bench seats,  these have almost no support for your lower back, so by the time you get out, you might just be thanking God that you can still walk, I can't stand to drive that thing unless I have a pillow on my back.

2. The Durability (HAhahahahahhahohohohohehehehehe, durability, bahahahahahaha!!!!)

Let's just say these things run, until you hit the magic number, 100,000 miles, seems to be a curse to these things, everything starts going wrong with the car, to date I've had to replace the transmission, the starter, the oil pan, the head gasket, yes, this thing has a horrible cooling system, I actually look forward to winter because my car won't try and overheat on me, the head gasket cracked last summer, after I went to replace it, I nearly lost the next one cause the water pump sprung a leak on me, in an unrelated incident, that leaked coolant all over the serpentine belt, and I had to get another one of those, and around this time, the tensioner pulley went (yup, replaced that too), and the engine started churning up this milky stuff in the oil, which means that this summer, I'm gonna have to swap out the engine for a whole new one, oh well, at least the body lasted.

3. The controls and interior design

OK, the steering wheel will either make you streth your arms like you're in a Jane Fonda workout, or it will leave you feeling like you are in a Formula One race car, also, combined with the gear shifter on the steering wheel, and the bench seats, I think they were going for "UFO" on the outside and "Grandpa Car" on the inside, which makes for a horribly unfashionable, if not downright gaudy look to this car.

Another thing, after locking myself out three times, with the car running, I'm starting to think that the positioning of those auto door lock buttons was a little ill-thought.

4. The Packard Bell of cars

You remember Packard Bell?

The computer company that went out of business that was always trying to advertise their systems as being really powerful, then leaving you with a bucket of proprietary parts that turned out to be cheap crap that would sooner rather than later, fail on you, this is the Lumina, ALL OVER.

You get a V-6 3.1 litre engine with 161 horsepower, power everything, options galore, then one, by one, it all starts breaking on you, just remember, you get what you pay for, and you won't be done paying for this car until the day it finally dies on you, if you get it new, great, figure about 140,000 miles before pawning it off on some idiot that doesn't know whats in store for them, if you buy used, well, don't buy used, like I said, around 140,000 miles it's past the point of no return I'd advise getting one, keeping the oil changed, and gas in it, regularly getting the various fluids and occasional spark plugs changed, and other than that, driving it until it just dies.



5. Misc

This is probably the worst car to own if you'll be in really hot, or really cold weather, in the Summer, the thing will want to overheat on you and leave you stranded, in Winter, there is ice on this things windshield before there is ice on any other car, at 11 PM when I get off work, everyone else hops in their cars, and take off, but not me, I'm left trying to scrape the ice off my windshield, and even AFTER that, they fog up on you to the point that your visibility is 60% at best, and theres nothing you can do except drive it and hope you don't run over someone on the way home.
