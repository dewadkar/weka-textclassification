            I've been the owner of a 1995 850 Turbo sedan since new.  Initially there were no problems with the car as you might expect.  
Only after 40,000 miles did all hell break loose.  Initially it was a severe shake of the automatic transmission when I shifted it into reverse.  This annoying trait was only apparent after the car had warmed up.  The dealer examined this trait and had no answers for me.  Next, the door sensors malfunctioned, turning on the light in the footwell and accompanying Huey Lewis and The News with an annoying chime.  Soon after this the passenger seat began to shake around a bit.  Just annoying little things that drive your nerves up the wall after awhile.  The only major problem in 110,000 miles has been the transmission and brakes.  The brakes developed an annoying pulse when braking from highway speeds and above:) This was due to a malfunctioning ABS system.  It was fixed and hasn't caused a problem since.
The sporting orientation of the 850 is hampered by a front wheel drive layout that causes the front tires to not only wear out quickly, but to loose traction when attempting to prevent a enema courtesy of a 20 ton big rig. This weight bias also throws off what would be an good handling car. 
The acceleration of the 850 is better than most.  It has plenty of power to cruise comfortably up steep grades and the brakes to slow it down.  
The Volvo 850's styling also leaves something to be desired.  The plain jane box look is an effective contraceptive, but I believe the point of a car does not fall into that category.  
The car has many safety systems built in.  Side impact airbags, driver and passenger airbags, amazing integrity as well as passive safety systems such as ABS and winter mode for the transmission.  
Don't take me wrong, the Volvo 850 is an effective car.  I simply believe that with your money, you would be better off buying something else.
