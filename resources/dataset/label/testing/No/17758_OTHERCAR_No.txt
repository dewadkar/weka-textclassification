            Yes, the Saturn SL is a good car for your money. If you are using monopoly money. When the car first came out as the Renault did back in the 80's people thought that the car would be of the same quality yearin and year out. They were mistaken...sorely. The quality and the craftsmanship of Saturns have not only gotten worse over the years but the salesman and individuals behind the car itself have seemed to erode. 
It used to be I could walk into any Saturn dealership and be greeted with a smile and that was it. I knew I could walk around the showroom to my hearts content perusing everything in sight slamming doors, kicking tires, honking horns and until I was ready to actually sit down with someone to talk about getting a car I would not be hassled that however has changed. Now try walking into a dealership and you will be in for a big surprise. It seems as the dealers as well as the assemble workers were sitting on their hands all this time, they just couldn't sit their quietly anymore so they had to move. The new cars coming off the assembly lines are riddled with imperfections all over. Take 3 new 98 and 99 Saturns we just bought for our company. Every single one of them had defects. Yes, a normal owner would not see many of these, such as misaligned seats, loose seat belts, tight steering wheels, misaligned rear view mirrors. Not to name improperly inflated tires uneven trunk and hood seams and even defects in paint. Most of these are not noticeable to the untrained eye, but $800 plus on average in repairs is a big problem. Just think what these small problems can lead to in 3 years or 37,000 miles! Don't even bother looking at what's under the hood. Saturns have been underpowered for years. I have known teenagers who have stripped off the metal sheeting to make their saturns quicker. Of course voiding the warranty and making it look like an eyesore. Before buying that new Saturn make sure you do kick those tires...HARD!!!<br><br>
