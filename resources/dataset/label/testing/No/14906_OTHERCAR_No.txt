If your the type of person who likes to send photos to friends and family on line the Sony Mavica may be for you. The pictures easily download to your PC from which they can be e-mailed all over the world or printed as a hard copy.

Pictures of poor quality can be erased from the disc and replaced by a new picture as free memory is restored for your use. Floppy discs are economical to purchase and can be reused if erased.

But if you like your pictures on photo paper you will find that printing your own photos is expensive with the resulting quality only as good as your printer. In addition, even with a good printer 35 mm pictures have a crisper quality.

As the novelty of using a digital camera has worn off I find that I mainly use my 35 mm camera. It is so much less bulky and heavy then the Mavica. <br><br>
