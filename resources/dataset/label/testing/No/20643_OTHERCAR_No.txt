            We bought the 2000 A6 2.7 to replace a 1995 BMW 525 because the 2000 BMW 528s were so popular that a comparable lease would have been $200+ more per month.  The car is a beautiful, black stallion with after market window tinting, but our love ends there.

Audi Service

Contrary to the exceptional service from the local BMW dealership, dealing with the Audi people is like pulling teeth.  We have not been able to get the car into the shop in less than two weeks, and the drop off and pick-up routine is excruciatingly slow.  

Quality

There are many defects that come with this car.  First, I have had the car in for service at least three times for problems with the electric windows.  Second, there is a lip on the bottom of the car that will slip over non-standard parking curbs (higher than about five inches)and then will literally rip the front end off the car when you put it in reverse and the transmission drops down about a quarter of an inch.  Audi knows about this defect, but will only fix it one time (the second time cost me $1,300).  Finally, not to be too picky, but the rear seat cup-holders have never worked properly, despite being reported to the dealership every time the car is in for service or repair.  

Performance

The 2000 Audi lacks guts (though I knew this when I bought it).  I have an uphill freeway entrance nearby so I have to use the triptronic shifting to get up to speed efficiently.  At highway speeds (about 80) it cruises very well and handling is fine.  Audi decided that only the driver needs a door lock/unlock button, so my wife has to lean over from the passenger seat to lock the doors if I get out of the car to run into a store.

Overall

This is an excellent car for someone moving up from a VW or a Japanese sedan, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is accustomed to the likes of Mercedes or BMW. The service problems, manufacturers defects and design flaws stand out.
