            I am the owner of a 1999 Pontiac Sunfire Convertible
I will start by saying that my car may be the exception not the rule.  But it is a piece of poo!  I have not been able to get the strength to trade it in yet (the whole men flocking to me thing), but I know I should.  I bought the car used, lease return, with 9 thousand miles on it.  I had to put an ENTIRE NEW ENGINE in it at the 20 thousand mile mark that the snotty people at GM refused to admit was their fault.  Well, there is $2,500 down the drain.  They said that there was a leak in the oil pan (somehow that was my fault they say) that caused dirt to get into my engine and eventually destroy it!  HA
My convertible motor has gone out twice.  I put my top down 1 to two times a month.
My volume control knob does not work.
The window motors have been replaced twice. 
The cruise control goes out for no reason while in use. The rear upholstery is flimsy, and tore very easily.  The top is very thin, and you get wet whenever is snows or rains.  The seatbelts are really short.  They barely go around the slightly rounder population, and the actual buckles rust easily, just from moisture in the air.  Phew.

It also gets HORRID gas mileage.  Like 22 mpg.

It does look cute, it has better pick up than my explorer 6 cylinder, and I think it is roomy, especially for a convertible.  Decent trunk.  The ets (emergency traction system) is super.  It really works, and it has saved me while driving on the ice once or twice.  

oh.... it only has one cup holder in the front!  where am I supposed to put my change??? :)

I will never buy a convertible, or a sunfire ever again.  I take really good care of it, but I think it hates me.
All I ever wanted was a cute car to pick up guys..... :)hehe
