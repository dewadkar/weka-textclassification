            I brought a 97 Venture extended van to replace a very dependable 89 Plymouth Grand Voyager and I have had more problems with the Venture and GM then I had with the Plymouth.  At 71,000 miles the transmission burned-up and this is using the van on a highway and not towing.  Since there is only a 36,000 mile warranty, GM agreed to split the cost to install a new transmission.  After 25,000 miles the transmission went out again and GM said to bad the the new replacement transmission only had a 12,000 warranty since GM paid half the cost and not the 36,000 miles on a new part.  Then van is great for traveling but GM is bad for customer service.<br><br>
