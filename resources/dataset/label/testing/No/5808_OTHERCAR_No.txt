            A good friend of mine lent me her Olympus D-490 digital camera for a while. Thus my liaison with the D-490 began. I've borrowed the cam for months at a time, so I feel qualified to write a review.

<b>Picture Quality</b>
This is one area where the D-490's age shows. The picture quality is good if you are looking to print 4x9 or 5x9 photos. However, when I attempted to print out an 8x10 picture, the quality was fairly grainy and had an overall <i>cheap</i> look. Color balance and saturation are fine. One minor annoyance is that shots on the LCD display often have different lighting than the pictures themselves.Quality is suitable for e-mailing photos or posting them on the web. Note: All photo printing was done using my Epson Stylus Photo 825. I have not experienced problems with other pictures from 2 different digital cameras.

<b>Appearance/Feel</b>
I like the champagne-and-black-colored look to Olympus's line. I didn't appreciate the weight and size of this camera. Carrying the D-490 in a pocket isn't enjoyable, unless you like being reminded where your cam is at all times and having it weight you down.

<b>Interface</b>
Thankfully, this cam is very easy to use. Just point and click. You can view your shots and delete them using the 1.8" LCD screen. Getting through menus and options is a breeze. Most questions are answered in the manual. Olympus did well by giving the D-490 such ease of use.

<b>PC Connectivity</b>
Connecting the D-490 to your computer using the included USB cable is a hassle. It takes longer than other products to load photos and my computer had trouble accepting the connection. A good way to remedy this is buying a media card reader.

The D-490 comes with a nice price tag and is easy to use.
