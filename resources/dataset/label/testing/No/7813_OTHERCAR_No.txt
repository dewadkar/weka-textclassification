            I bought my 1994 Saturn SC1 brand new.  It had 14 miles.  I congratulated myself on my wise purchase and general consumer intelligence. 

 I look back on this as the naivete of an 18 year old first time car buyer.

When the car was 7 months old the problems began.  Since that time, I have had to replace the alternator at least once a year.  I have been through 3 or 4 serpentine belts, 2 tentioners, 3 sets of spark plugs and wires, and I've forgotten how many batteries.  

When I called Saturn, long distance to Tenn. mind you, I got a very &quot;different&quot; kind of response from the very &quot;different&quot; company's customer service rep.

&quot;So what?&quot;

Currently my windshield wipers do not work in the rain (they <b>do</b> work when it is dry out, however - oh, the irony) and Saturn wants $485.00 to fix them.  I'll stick to buying RainX, thanks.  That company has gotten more than enough of my money.<br><br>
