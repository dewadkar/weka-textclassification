            When I was 18 I could finally afford to buy my first car.  I deceided on the 1997 Cavalier because it was in my price range, I liked how it looked, and I knew that it had good gas milage.  The car was great for the first year and a half.  Absolutely no problems.  Then alot of little thing went wrong.  First of all the cigaratte lighter stopped working.  I had that fixed.  It was only like $20.00 to fix it. No big deal.  Then the horn stopped working so I had to get that fixed.  There was some sort of short somewhere and that was fixed.  Then the car started acting wierd.  When I would come to a stop or slow down the car would start jerking really bad and sometimes it even died. I had that repaired.  There was some sort of fluid leak that got the spark plugs wet and it was the cause of it.  Next my speakers died.  The were the factory speakers but still I expected them to hold up.  Two of them went out.  I haven't had major problems but they all added up.  It is a pain to have to keep getting things repaired.  Also in the time that I have had the car I have gotten about 6 or 7 recalls on it.  The car gets GREAT gas mileage and I love how it looks. But over time the car deteriorates.  Now the car is LOUD and I'm not sure why. I'm gonna have to get it checked out again.. I am ready for a new car but still owe about 4,000 on this car.  To trade it in I only can get about 3,500 - 4,000 and it is still in pretty good shape.  What a bummer huh?<br><br>
