            I test-drove this vehicle and I have to say that it was really nice, decked out, and it gave a smooth ride.  But, it was very tight for space on the inside.  If you usually travel in your car with more than  one person other than yourself, I would not recommend this car. Although, If you want something sporty and nice.  I would definitely get this car. (although everyone else already has one). I would recommend the 2000 Mercury Cougar for everyone.  Be sure to check my review on the new 2000 model Mercury Cougar V-6 Sport Coupe!!  The car is magnificent!!<br><br>
