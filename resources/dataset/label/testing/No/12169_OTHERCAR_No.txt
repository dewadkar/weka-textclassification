            I personally would not recommend this vehicle to anybody. I have had this for 2 years now, and it has given me ignition problems again and again. Go to Carpoint.com or edmunds.com and see its recall or trouble history that Oldsmobile has stated. It is a luxury liner from inside, that's the only pros I can figure out. Otherwise it has seen the mechanic shop a lot more times than any of my previous cars. Frankly, this car is not an ideal SUV.<br><br>
