            I recently had experince with this car for 2 weeks in December.  It was a 1999 Buick Lesabre Custom with only 4300 miles on the odometer.  I absolutely loved the car when I first drove it,  it was whisper quiet and had a smooth ride.  Then I pulled out of the parking garage at the airport and got into real world conditions.  

Cons.  

Bouncy:  This car had the Grand Touring suspension (which is supposedly more firm) but boy did this thing bounce around like crazy.  I have never been carsick before but if I had to ride in this thing for more then 2 hours I sure would be sick.  I would hate to see what the non-grand touring suspenion LeSabres ride like.  

Numb:  This car had absolutely no feel to it,  the brakes were mushy and had no feedback,  the steering was slow,  unresponsive.

Small instruments:  Why oh why did Buick put these tiny gauges on a car that is going to be driven mostly by the older crowd who has trouble seeing?  I am pretty young myself and I had to take a good look of the gauges to even comprehend what they read.

Ineffective traction control:  The traction control system in this car is stupid.  I drove around quite a bit in the snow and I found absolutely no use for it.  There is a "low traction" light on the dashboard that tells you when the wheels are supposedly slipping.  Well this light would pop on while just cruising down the freeway,  but when I knew I was spinning the tires it didnt.  The traction control in now way stopped the wheels from spinning,  I could hear it making a very bad sounding grinding noise when it would kick in but thats about all it did.  

Stupid idiot lights:  For anyone who has driven the car you know the thing that runs atop the dashboard that has the idiot lights.  Well this thing is just an annoyance,  the idiot lights run all the way over to where the passenger is sitting.  For example the cruise control light was nowhere near the driver.  It was over towards the right side of the car.  

The message the car sends:  this is one of those cars that makes you feel old driving it.  You really want to look for gray hairs when you hop out.  

Pros.

Powerful 3800 V6:  this car has far more power then you will ever need,  this thing could probably outrun a Grand Prix.  

Quiet ride:  this thing was whisper quiet,  there was minimal noise at all times.  The engine did sound kind of grainy at higher rpms but I digress.  

Overall I would probably only recommend this car if you have a strong stomach,  great eyesight,  and dont care if the car makes you look like an oldtimer.  But other then that I would avoid this car.
