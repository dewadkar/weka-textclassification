            It was a sad day. The day my baby(daughter)taught my 1996 chev corsica how to roll over and play dead. The replacement car the dependable 2000 hyundai elantra. As a truck driver I spend time away from home. The roadside help sounded good until needed it. It took 5 days for them to come get my car to fix the recall. We drive a lot of miles and that problem has not hit most of the 2000's yet. So at 28,000 mile the car refused to go more than 25 mph and shook. Than it died. Lucky me we were in our drive way. I don't know what I would of done if I was stranded. If you read the small print on the roadside help it covers the first $50. That's probably why the salesman said "hek it stranded we will even bring you out a gallon of gas to get you going". About all $50.00 will cover these days. 
Over all I liked the ride of this car. That is until you drive it into a strong wind. The grill makes a lound howling noise, so loud you can't even hear the radio.
I am happy I bought this car at the dealer I did because they paid for a rental while the recall part was back ordered. The manufacture said no rental reimbursement. Our problems started two days before Christmas so their was only one car left on the rental lot. It was a catilac! Now that's a nice ride.
I think I will trade this car in and go back to chev. I put 259,000 miles on the corsica before it was terminated by my daughter. We had no problems with it at all. I am consistant about changing the oil every 3000 miles.
Good luck to all the hyundai owners out their. I think the promise is more that the manufacture is willing to back.
