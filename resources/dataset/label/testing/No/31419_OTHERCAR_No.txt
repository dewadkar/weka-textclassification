            The interior of this sports car has more luxury than most sports but the gauges and dash layout let you hold onto the dream of sports car.
Interior room was adequate for two adults and a small child and plenty of room for luggage.
Power came from its four liter V8, and there was no slacking there.
Cruising through the countryside was the highlight for me, and showed that it was undoubtly a sports car.
Oddly enough, the rear end did want to get loose in the extreme, but for the most part this nimble beast enjoyed playing.
The Brakes were the best Iï¿½d seen in a long time, with only moderate but manageable fade during several high speed stops.
Definitely an eye catcher on the road (my heart is with the dodge viper always, but this one isn't bad!) this is the car you could use every day then will let you play on the weekends, a nice change from so many of the single minded cars we see today, and besides, it is a JAG!  Who could ask for more? sure not me, i think its great i love it soo much.<br><br>
