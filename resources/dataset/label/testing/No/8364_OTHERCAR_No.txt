            Not to state the obvious, but the car is a nice looking piece of machinery.  I will grant you that.  But before you put out the cash for this muscular road menace, be aware of one owner's story.  I'm a young and successful entrepreneur in my early 20's and I thought a Firebird would cap my persona just fine.  And I will admit that it is a nice looking car.  But in 2 short years, the dream machine has become a nightmare.  First, a good point about this auto.  The engine is strong.  GM has a habit of making motors that will not quit, and I have to say that this one runs the same today as it did the day I bought it.  Very smooth.  But they always say, &quot;It's the little things that kill.&quot;  And how right they are.  The electrical system in the Firebird is outrageously poor.  Here is a list of electronic devices (made to make our lives easier) that are now failing in this car...

Cruise Control
Windows
Radio remote controls
Interior lighting
(3) Alternators
Windshield Wipers
Windshield Washers
2nd gear transmission start button

To name a few.  Some of these are worse than others.  But all lf them combined make a very tedious car ride.  Get this.  When the 2nd gear transmission start button failed, it caused my Transmission to start in second gear for 5 months before I realized it.  By then, it was too late and my transmission was ruined.  1600 dollars, right there, folks.  And the car wasn't even two years old.  By the way, the car rides like a freight train, so if you are into pleasureable cruising, get a lexus.<br><br>
