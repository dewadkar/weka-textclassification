            I wanted a simple entry level digital camera to take photos of items for selling on Ebay and other on-line forums. I actually bought this one by mistake at Target thinking it was the Go 2000. With 1.3 megapixels the quality of the image is acceptable however the flash is too bright. The body is made of cheap plastic and so are the controls giving it a plastic-y toy like feel. 

The menus are easy to use and some of the options stay after the unit is turned off however some like flash do not. There is no exterior flash on off button like on an Olympus D390 so you have to go through a number of menus to turn the flash on and off which is annoying and time consuming. Given the cheap plastic buttons, you sometimes have to press a key more than once to get it to do what you want. The flash is good for taking photos of items more than 6 feet away however anything closer is washed out. You would do better to shine a big light on the subject and turn the flash off. 

I paid $80 at Target however Best Buy sells the Go 2000 with 2.0 megapixels for the same price on-line. Therefore I think this camera is overpriced however the Go 2000 may be made of the same cheap plastic. I returned this model and plan to buy an Olympus D390 which at $130 and 2.0 megapixels with a 1.8in lcd is not made of cheap plastic and has better controls.
