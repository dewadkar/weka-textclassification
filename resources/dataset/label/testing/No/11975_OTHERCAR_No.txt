            I bought this car because I knew the Toyota was going to sell the Chevy couterpart (Cavalier), as the Toyota Cavalier.  I figured if Toyota had enough faith in the car, I could too.  Up until this point, I was dead set on buying a Civic.  

I ended up with a bright aqua GT, 1SB package (cruise, uplevel CD player), and moonroof.  Upon taking delivery, the car was tight as a drum.  Ten thousand miles later, the rattles and sqeaks started.  The steering column shook like a belly dancer, and the interior plastics began to look a lot cheaper than they did previously.  My potential Toyota soon revealed its Sunbird roots.

After forty thousand miles, my car had FOUR new transmissions intalled (5-speed).  The third unit they installed was immediately removed and replaced, because it was too bad to deliver to me.

The Sunfire looks great (until the '99 restyle--I don't know what Pontiac was thinking.  And the car never stranded me.  The Sunfire never failed to start and give faithful service.  But the tranny woes scared me enough to force my hand and trade the car in.  Also, I could no longer deal with the crappy handling (the steering is overly light and the rearend gets real nervous on rough turns), the squeaks and rattles, the cheap interior plastic.  Oh, and resale value is horrible (i.e. typical GM).  I bought the car for 16800, and after two years, I was being offered $6500 for it.  When I traded it in, I received $7000 from a Pontiac dealer.

Likes:  Great styling, great stereo, smooth powerful engine with nice noises and good fuel economy.  A fairly fun car to drive on smooth roads, a lot like a 9/10's Grand Prix.

Dislikes:  Cheap plastic interior, light, vague steering, unsophisticated suspension for a car with sporting pretenses, very loose structure, a new transmission every ten thousand miles.
