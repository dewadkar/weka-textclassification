            My 1998 Chevy Cavalier is my first car that I purchased brand new 2 years ago. I bought the thing because my family had always been a &quot;Chevy&quot; family and I was drawn to the price. I, like many, had looked at the Saturn offering (probably more because of their offbeat commercials than for any desire to own a car that looks like a Saturn) and was frightened by the foam door approach that line has gone with. Really now, safety-shmafety....if my door is made out of mostly foam, I don't want to know about it. I want to see some steel beams in that thing when I look at their little cross-section in the dealer lobby.

Needless to say, I have had a few problems with my Chevy Cavalier. I have put a significant amount of mileage on it in a little over 2 years (49,000 miles so far) and stuff has gone wrong that I feel shouldn't have gone wrong. Here is a rundown:

1. I went to a Jiffy Lube one day and my oil dipstick broke where the cap connects to the metal dipstick. Upon going to the Chevy dealership at a later date, I was told that my 36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty was over (I was at around 36,500 by then even though the thing had actually broken before 36,000 miles.) and that I would need to pay for the part. Yes, $12 is a small price to pay but really, does anyone ever expect to pay for a new oil dipstick at any point in the life of their car?

2. The ABS (anti-lock braking indicator) light started coming on whenever it wanted over this past summer of '99. Without warning, the bright orange ABS light came on. Nothing was wrong with the car but that light tends to be annoying. I also noticed a grinding noise when I started turning the wheel to the left. After going to the Chevy dealer, I was told that the problem was my bushings were going, I was told that this was a fairly common thing and that I could expect even replacing them another time over the life of the car, I had that fixed, with assurances that it would fix the grinding problem as well. As soon as I left, the grinding noise was still there. I called them on it and they went for a drive with me to see what I was talking about. Turns out that I have build-up or something with my wheel-bearing and I need to get that replaced for $244.

3. In early 1999, I went out to the car to go to work one morning, put my key in the ignition and found that I could not turn the key at all. I tried again....and again...and again...went back up to my apartment to get the other key for a second key's opinion and it still did not turn at all. The steering column was completely locked and the key would not budge. I had to call the dealership for a tow. They covered everything and replaced the sterring column for free (because I was still under warranty...they probably would have screwed me otherwise.) Crazy stuff like that should not be going on with a car.

4. This item is an update added after I wrote my original opinion on this stupid car. This past weekend, 6 May 2000, after driving over a pothole, my windshield wiper lever broke. I did not even touch it. Now, it's all loose and jiggly and my wipers turn on when I go over bumps. I have decided to write a letter to my original car dealer as well as GM corporate. This is just yet another reason not to buy a Cavalier. At this point, I think it safe to say that I do not recommend Chevrolet at all anymore. $15,000 is too much to pay for something that may or may not be dependable.

I'm sure more stuff will happen to the thing. As a car owner, you don't expect major problems with a car for at least a long while. I've had many issues with mine, compounded by certified Chevy mechanics who don't seem to have much of a clue. I also find it odd that things have gone wrong on the car AFTER the 36,000 bumper-to-bumper warranty has expired. I've had time, since (I was a little bit rushed in purchasing this car in the first place.) to look at other cars and see the features and deals they come with and I will definitely be driving another brand like Honda or VW in the future.

Other companies offer similar level cars for the same or less price that are better crafted and come with more of a solid guarantee. My girlfriend got a 1999 Honda Civic DX this summer and I compare my car and hers and see how it could be better. The styling (Hondas look like they've taken lessons from Volvo and VW and I like that), the warranty (60,000 mile), the service (excellent), the materials inside (my car has this pleather and scratchy Scotchguard upholstery...hers has hard rubber and plush Scotchguard and less of a feeling that everything is stuffed with cheap foam).

Hell, get the Chevy Cavalier if you want but I would strongly encourage you to take a look at the Honda Civic models or the VW Jetta. You'll probably be better for it in the end.
