            1990 Eagle Summit four door sedan for sale. Red in color. Mileage is 119,000. Bright red paint in relatively good condition. Looking to get at least a dent in one quarter�s tuition for the asking price. See details below if interested:

<b>It runs like a . . .</b>

Mule without two legs. Group of nursing home residents in a three-legged race. Pinto in a crash derby. Arkansas man after a hot dog eating contest. Pot bellied pig with 12 nursing piglets attached. I could go on, but you can see that it is an awesome piece of machinery. An engineering marvel, if you will. But really, it isn�t all that bad . . . until you reach speeds of 45 mph and higher. That is when all Hell breaks loose and you begin to get the full body massage. Who needs shiatsu when I have my daily commute in the �I wish I was going faster lane.�

The 1990 Eagle Summit was not built for speed. I�m not quite sure what it was built for. I think the people at Eagle (Mitsubishi, actually built this � it�s the Mirage) were looking to fill the same void once occupied by the Yugo and the Geo series of mistakes. The car does fine on city streets, if you hit every light while it�s green. It has a painful acceleration reaching speeds from 0-60 in the same time frame as smoking about two cigarettes and drinking a coke.

<b>Hope you like your mechanic</b>

Because you will get to know him well. I have had the car for almost two years. I have had to replace the radiator, the valve cover, the discs and rotors, the battery and the clutch. You will be getting a nearly new car. Don�t fear (I will for you) because it won�t be long until you have something fall out from under the hood or begin to smell something akin to rotting dingos through you air vents. I have put more than $2000 into this beauty that I like to call Red Trash (my first car was a 1984 white Honda Accord I called White Trash). I like to think of this as a piggy bank that has it�s own mind . . . it won�t give me my damn money back even though I keep putting more in. I think you should feel it is a value added sort of a deal. You will be buying a car that has depleted the small savings of a third world country (and a poor college students bank account). 

<b>You want features?</b>

So do I! This car is a classic example of minimalism. Rather than tell you what it does have, I think it would benefit you as the buyer more to see what it lacks. It does not have air conditioning (which is only slightly bad in California in the summer). It does not have four speakers that work (there is one left that is on it�s last leg . . . I get to hear my music in mono . . . like the good ole days. Don�t worry though . . . 88.5 is the only station that comes in well and it is   National Public Radio . . . no stereo sound required.) There is no cruise control, but it wouldn�t work at the maximum speed of 35 that is a good day for this car. This model is a manual. Be thankful it�s not an automatic as that would take away about half of this little monster�s power. There are no power windows or door locks. This can be a blessing if you have friends who don�t realize this, leave the door unlocked and then the car gets stolen . . . too bad it isn�t in the top 1000 on the car thief list. There is no ABS, but that�s for weenies who like safety first . . . let them buy a Volvo.

<b>I�m driving excitement!</b>

This car you are about to buy is an adventure. You never know where it isn�t going to take you. Some days it seems to have a vendetta against Safeway. Other days it has real problems with GAP. I think those stories on NPR about the GAP sweatshops gave it a social conscience. My favorite is when it doesn�t like for me to get to work on time and decides it needs a newer, sexier battery. It has taught me that living by the clock and being on time is so BMW. I like to talk to Red sometimes. The conversations have some variations: �Please, God, make it start!�  �You better make it to the mechanic you piece of . . . �  �I�ll buy you super unleaded if you make it over 50 mph today� You can see that we have a one sided relationship. I am thinking of getting some tapes to teach it Spanish. I  think it may then forget English and not understand all the bad things I and other passengers say about it.

<b>Overall</b>

I am very pleased with my purchase and I believe you will be as well. One last bit of     advice . . . Red doesn�t like her ashtray to be used . . . she prefers you to ash in the backseat like the previous owners did.
