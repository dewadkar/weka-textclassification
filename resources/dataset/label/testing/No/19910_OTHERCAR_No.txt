            In March of '96 I was in desperate need of a bare bones pickup thats main purpose would be to shuttle me back and forth to work. Owning pickups most of my life I opted to once again tap the truck market and see what was out there. The Dakota offered the best value. It truly is a tough truck with a solid power plant. I should have gotten the 6 cylinder rather than the 4 because the 4 just doesn't have the get up and go needed for highway driving. 
I've owned 3 Chrysler vehicles including this truck and after a few years they have all exhibited the same malady. "ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS". Not simple blown fuse problems. But seemingly complex difficulties in apparently unrelated systems, requiring more than one visit to the mechanic. 
Chrysler WAKE UP! Your electrical systems are horrid. 
I've owned 3 Chrysler vehicles in 20 years and they all suffer the same type of problem.
