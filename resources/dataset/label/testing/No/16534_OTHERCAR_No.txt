            I purchased a new '96 Jetta and everything that could have gone wrong did. The brakes went out the sixth month, the dealer said they have cheap parts and that's why they go out so quickly. Since that time the service manager has left and the service still hasn't improved. The clutch went out (and I had been driving a Fiero for 10 years 200,000 and only had to change the clutch three times) and it was the same excuse. The chairs became disconnected from the floor and have not been able to be tightened down this whole time. My salesman said I had a year bumper to bumper (should have checked the warrantee a bit closer) and they tried to sting me for the clutch. The clutch went out again a year later, it turns out the didn't properly have the seal in correctly in the first place and the fluid was getting on the clutch. The electric system went completely nuts and killed the battery and I had to have it towed in several times. Don't ever buy a car from Boardwalk in Redwood City, the service takes forever, they do things you don't want them to do and they promise the world and deliver nil. I went to the district manager who was a completely rude woman who wouldn't give me her last name. I went to the CEO of Volkswagen in Michigan (contact me at readithere@aol.com if you want his direct fax line) with these problems and he shined me on. I have also talked to other people about their Jetta problems, it's not a rare. Don't buy ï¿½ totally sucks!<br><br>
