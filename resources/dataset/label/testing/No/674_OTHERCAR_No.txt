            Dear Friends,
       The new Coolpix 950 is a major upgrade from the widely acclaimed Coolpix 900S. It incorporates a broad sweep of enhancements making it better, faster and smarter. For starters, it sports a 2.1Megapixel, 1/2 inch CCD sensor, a sturdy magnesium case with an advanced ergonomic design, a huge RAM for rapid cycling between shots, a powerful macro mode. I reccomend this digital camera becasue it has many useful purposes.  These 4 below being just a few of the many.
     
1)It is fast and easy to load you will never have to fumble around trying to reload your camera and end up exposing a roll of film 
2)You can view the picture before you develope it. This means that you will never print junk pictures. 
3)Your are easily able to scan in your best pictures and atatch them to an email.
4)You will never have to to buy another role of expensive film again 
    
      This is one of the greatest cameras i have ever seen! Before you jump on this offer their is one draw back. if you are trying to shoot action shots it does have a slight delay from the time you press the button. However, I have still been able to get great action shots now that i have gotten used to it. But what i think is the best feature of this camera i that you can buy programs to remove red eye, add make up, remove pimples, and wrinkles.  With this i made my grandfather look like he was in his 40s. This program to edit the pictures is extra but i still recommend the cammera and you should look into this futher.
