            I got my Corolla in July of '97 because my Buick century finally died.  I was so tremendously heartbroken, that I didn' t even want to look at a car, at last I did, and boy am I glad!  I really don't know where to start!   I had a 2 year lease--they gave me an excellent option to buy a couple of months ago, so I'm keeping it, that alone speaks volumes!  It gets 300 miles to a tank, keyless entry, air, windows, the whole deal!

I think this car is great for SMALL families or single people.  The leg room isn' t great--I'm 5'8&quot; and it's a little cramped, so people in the back would be a tad crammed!  The corolla handles awesome, and is virtually maintenance free too.

Only bad points, leg room, as I mentioned, options are somewhat high, and no sunroof!  Other than that, have a ball!
