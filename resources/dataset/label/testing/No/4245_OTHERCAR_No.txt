            I bought my 2001 GTI in October of 2000 with 13 miles on it.  Since then I have had to replace the transmission, turbo, key immobilizer system, both window regulators, sun roof, cup holders, trunk hatch, radio, and airbag.  I took VW to the Better Business Bureau through arbitration and LOST.  VW refuses to replace the vehicle or to buy it back.  I am on a first name basis with all members of the service center, receptionists recognize my voice when i call in, and i am repeatedly having to take it in for service.  The used car dealer DOES NOT even want to buy it back from me for 60% of what I paid for it.  Do not buy a Volkswagen of any kind... they do not stand by their product... they don't care about their customer's satisfaction or safety.  They can't explain repairs and even when they don't know what is wrong with the vehicle, they will repeatedly let me drive home in it knowing that it is not safe to drive.
