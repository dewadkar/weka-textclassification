            I bought this vehicle because a friend of mine had an earlier version and had had no problems aside from wind noise.  When it came time for me to choose a car, I purchased a 1998 Amethyst Neon Expresso from a local Plymouth dealer. A sharp 5 speed manual transmission. Good gas milage. What looked to be real winner.  I was in love with its looks and performance...for a few months.  It's been in the shop often.  Wind noise - no biggie.  Bad ignition system - big problem.  The dealership wouldn't admit there was a problem with the ignition system and continued to replace sparkplug wires and sparkplugs (the no. 3 plug and wire kept frying).  When the &quot;check engine&quot; light came on, they simply flashed the computer and reset it to run rich to cover the bad performance.  I argued.  I complained.  I even complained to Plymouth about the dealership.  Then I gave up. 

 The clutch bearing (not the clutch plate) went bad within 30,000 miles.  I dropped $500 into a new clutch assembly and the new bearing is just as cheesy as the old one.  

Today, 2 years and 60,000 miles later, my neon is gathering dust in the garage while I save up to have the ignition system replaced. I feel used. 

Who should buy this vehicle?  Only someone who works on cars for a living.  I wouldn't reccommend this lemon to anyone.<br><br>
