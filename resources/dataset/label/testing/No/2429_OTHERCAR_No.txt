            I did like the looks of the car and the roomy interior. It all started with an Oil Change, that is when they spotted the transmission leak, then it went on to transmission problems one after the other. After fixing the problem I received a recall notice from Chrysler stating that the Ball Joints and restraint system were &quot;UNSAFE&quot; to drive and to take my car to the nearest dealer to fix the problem. 
Then I was driving in the snow that winter and when I had to brake in the snow the brakes locked up and the pedal began to vibrate and a clunking sound came from the front wheels, and you could feel this on the brake pedal. So I called the dealership to ask if there had been a recall on the ABS System but they had said NO! I beg to differ. I had downloaded off the Internet all the faults found and reported to Chrysler Corp, and there it was as plane as day the recall but they stood by there story!
After a few months of dealing with this I had come across another problem, the engine light would come on , now keep in mind this vehicle only had 46,000 miles. <br><br>
