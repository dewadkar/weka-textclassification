            "Awesome," I thought.  My small town Wal-mart does sell a digital camera.

Reasons that fooled me into buying:
 1.inexpensive
 2.comes w/ a 4 MB memory card that can store up to 330 pics!
 3.comes w/ 4 AA batteries
 4.pictures can be uploaded to a computer
 5.can take pictures up close and far away


I found out:
 1.it's inexpensive for a reason
 2.turns out you can only store 330 pics if you use the lowest quality of picture.  45 w/ the highest quality
 3.the batteries only last for about 25 pics if the LCD screen is on
 4.the pictures upload slow
 5.pictures taken a foot close or very far away turn out blury


 
This camera is useful if you:
  *have time to wait between pics
  *only have $100 to spend

This camera is not useful if you:
  *plan to take pictures at a party
  *plan to take pictures of something moving
  *plan to take a lot of pics w/out having to change batteries
  *plan to take pictures at night
  *plan to be hassel free

Other Problems: 
  *software not compatible w/ Windows NT
  *settings change on you without you touching a thing
  *bulky 

"Damn, my small town Wal-mart ripped me off w/ this PDC640 crap," I realized.  *I think they realized it too because they discontinued it shortly.
