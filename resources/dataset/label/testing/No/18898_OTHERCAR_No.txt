            The first year of having this car was the most miserable year of my life.  every other week my Laredo was in the shop with a rattle here, a grinding noise there, or paint falling off.  Talk about a nightmare!

I still own this car, only because the value of it has depreciated so much its not worth getting a new car.  At first I was in love with the redesign, but I soon found out what a big mistake it was, and what a fool I was for buying it at age 19.  

It started with the dealership screwing me with smaller wheels and crappy tires.  Then, the rear door wouldn't automatically lock.  Then, the window wouldn't roll up.  Then, the automatic locks wouldn't lock.  Then, the rear differentials ground down.  This, apparently, Chrysler knew about since they purposely put in a gear that was a thousandth of an inch smaller than spec.  So they KNEW it would grind to a halt and not let me turn without the entire neighbourhood knowing about it!  And now, 8 years later, My car sounds like a outboard motor and has warm air coming out the vents even when its on cold.  Yeah, its a just dandy.

Is this really any way to make an SUV?  They're supposed to be rugged and built well.  Well, this first year was a lemon year, and I know I am not alone in this.  Jeep cannot seem to shake their reputation, and I do not understand how they can condone such a poor reputation.

I am not sure if it is Jeep or Chrysler in general, but I will never again purchase a Jeep vehicle.  With the amount of money I have spent fixing this car, I could have gone and purchased a Land Rover Defender 90!  Now there's a real SUV!<br><br>
