            It has been about 3 months since I purchased my 2000 Chevy Blazer 4-door LS model.  I am sure that you have already researched the vehicle and all of the major goodies.  I am here to tell you about the little things that make the Chevy Blazer a great buy.  

First, the full size spare is great.  I wouldn't want to be left on the highway eith a small doughnut tire, would you?  
The rear hatcn opens in the position.  This is great when it rains and I am fishing.  Taking those wet boots off in the rain can be annoying.  Just sit under the hatch inside of your Blazer and it is dry and comfortable.  

The fold down seats allow a big enough space to for two peopke to sleep comfortably and the small headrests can double as a pillow.  
The storage space is huge and it hauls all of the baseball equiptment needed for my highschool team to play, plus the ater jug.  And that is with the seats up.  

The cruise control is great for the long haul.

The bucket seats are comfortable for any type of driving.

Don't buy this vehicle without the 4 wheel package....why get an SUV?

The only problems I have found with my particular vehicle are the gas mileage....about 17 pr gallon and the fact that I have only one lighter adaptor. 

I highly recommend this SUV
