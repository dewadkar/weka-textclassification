            When I bought this 2000 Intrepid, it fit the price range.  It looks sporty, feels sound and isn't another box.  

Once again, Dodge fails it's customers with more shoddy workmanship.  In 9 months, this car has had problems with all four windows (two falling out), loose doors, brake failure, and constant need to rotate tires (the ones still on - blow-outs with less than 3,000 miles on two).  

The front drivers'/passenger window design makes it impossible to open even the slightest during rain &amp; snow - it pours right in (and passengers are also very unhappy).  Large front and rear windows are almost impossible to clean. 

Back passenger doors have such a wide 'wing' - many a male passenger have left weeping after being clipped in an unfortunate area upon swinging this door open!  

Dodge service - same as ever, if it can be avoided or ignored, Dodge will. 

The first Intrepid I purchased was an 'executive car' - supposedly less money and 'without the leave the lot depreciation'.  It caught on fire on the dealer's lot, less than 12 hours after I took it home.  All the while, the dealer swore there was nothing wrong with this car!!  Foolish me, I decide to buy a brand new Intrepid, without the used car problems.  While I paid less for the new than I had for the used, I got the same problems - without the fire!<br><br>
