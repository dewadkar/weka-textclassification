            I am an SUV addict. I look at SUV's, I have SUV's, I research these cars and I idolize them. One problem I have is staring at the Nissan Pathfinder. Overall, this car is ugly compared to a Durango, JGC, or Explorer. And for around 29,000 dollars total, why would anyone spend this much money on a Japanese import rather than buying a nice american made Jeep or Durango? The pathfinder is crampped from the inside. It is not luxurious, and there is very little cargo room in the back compared to other SUV's of the price range. The ride can also show. The ride is bumpy, and it makes noises, another con which makes me wonder why they even make this SUV. It can not handle well in the snow compared to other Sport Utes, however it has a small size. Well I think the only people that would want a Pathfinder are those who dont' want to spend 1 thousand dollars more on a Jeep or Durango, becuase clearly, these are better SUV's. The Pathfinder, mereley sucks. <br><br>
