            I adored this car but hate Honda Motors because they would not acknowledge their design defect.  The Acuras of that era were built too low to the ground so that every time I hit a deep pot hole or raised sewer cover, the car bottemed out.  Three separate times the car incurred several hundred dollars in damage to some exposed parts on the undercarriage!  Honda denied that there was any problem.  I thought it was a nifty car otherwise with one other exception:  the front head light apparatus snaps out with the simplest of tools so that parking the car on the street was like setting out a &quot;smorgasbord&quot; for body shops.  I had to replace three headlights that were stolen from me, as were my hupcaps on several occasions.  
  Also, Acura of Long Island City was taken over by Silver Star Acura and I caught them in a lie, telling me I should have a repair done when I had the car in for something else.  The thing wasn't mandatory.  I asked the cost and was told $400.  I asked how long it would take and was told two hours.  I said I'd call my husband and let them know in a little while.  I called back to tell them to do it and asked when I could come get the car.  I was told I could come right away.  Therefore, the repair had been done without my permission and they were tricking me into agreeing to pay for it.  I complained to the manufacturer; they sent me papers, spoke to me on the phone, but ultimately did nothing.  I found another dealer at a greater distance, with no public transportation nearby.
While the new TL or RL were the most logical choice for me, my driving habits, etc. we abandoned Acura as a result of Honda Motor's lack of concern.<br><br>
