            this van is really a nice one but,there have been many recalls on parts from the seat belt hooks to the shock mounts for the back hatch.
the 3.3 is a good running motor,however the transmission has a problem that is very common from what i've heard.after so long the gear pin in the differential shears off and punches a hole in the bell housing causing it to leak.it's also very expensive to repair.the steering is very stiff instead of being nice and easy/smooth.it is very comfortable for long trips and gets fairly good gas mileage.another thing is that there is an emissions light in the dash that comes on in the dash to let you know when to have the emissions checked if it needs it or not&lt;between 50k and 125k miles&gt;.over all i would not recommend buying this van.it gets costly after a while. <br><br>
