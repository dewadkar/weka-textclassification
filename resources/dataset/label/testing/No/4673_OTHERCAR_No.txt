            My first mistake was taking a closer look at this affordable sports car.
Within 2 hours of owning the vehicle, all dashboard lights came on and did not go off.  The car was taken in and the dealership gave me nothing but the run around for the next week, the part we need isn't available, it's a holiday weekend, we are so busy...yadda, yadda, yadda....Before I agreed to take this car back, I negotiated for an extended warranty. (What a lifesaver!!!)  In the first nine months it was in 3 times due to an oil leak, which the dealer assured me was fixed time and time again. 
3 times is a charm?!!!!?  The computer has been a problem since day one, dummy lights for the next year.  Year 3 has been the starter, starts when the engine is cold, but not when its been running....This is still a problem, but I'm so disgusted with this vehicle, I'm just waiting to pay this thing off in 5 months...Hopefully it will make it that long...I would never buy another Chevy again...
