            For $80, this was the biggest waste of money i have ever had the misfortune to part with.

Sure, this camera looks cute, but dont be fooled. This camera has terrible picture quality, terrible battery life, terrible functionality, terrible design, and terrible everything else.

The picture quality of this camera is horrible. It is extremely grainy and blurry. Nothing can be done to make it better, as far as imaging software goes.

The battery life is incredibly bad. You will probably have to go through 4 pairs of batteries if you want to take the full 16 pictures that its memory can hold.

And that's another thing. The memory is bad. A couple of my pictures become corrupted every once in awhile, somehow. And i don't even use this thing!

The flash is no good. Low-light pictures with this camera are about as bad as a picture can get.

One interesting feature of this camera is its ability to connect to a vcr, and record to a vhs tape (without audio, of course). It was interesting that the image quality on the tv was tolerable, while the image quality of the pictures on the computer were unusable.

I think this has something to do with the fact that tvs display at a lower resolution than computers, so it was unable to pick up the imperfections in the picture.


Overall, this is a waste of money. It could be used as a child's toy camera, but it's way too expensive for that. Stay away from this one.
