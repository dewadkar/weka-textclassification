            I purchased my Toshiba PDR M-25 mainly because of the features for the price. I wanted an optical zoom and a high enough resolution picture to print well. The Toshiba seemed to fit the bill.
The camera takes good outdoor photographs with bright, vibrant, accurate color reproduction. There is a problem however with the lag between snapping the picture and when the picture is recorded. I have gotten several shots where the people I was photographing saw me "snap" the shot so they moved. The photo I got was of them moving - not the posed shot I intended to get. 
This is also a problem when trying to take a shot of a moving object, such as one of the deer that roams our neighborhood.
Low light photos come out grainy - like using a film camera in low light when the flash does not fire. Even with the flash on you must be close to the subject to take an indoor or outdoor evening picture. In Toshiba's defense they state that the flash is for pictures up to 8.2 feet away.
From reading reviews on several other digital cameras I think this must be a common complaint.
I have read several complaints about short battery life and I will agree with some clarification. When using the camera indoors and reviewing the pictures on the LCD screen I have had the batteries last only 10 or 12 pictures. Conversely when taking pictures outside I have taken in excess of 40 pictures on 1 set of alkaline batteries. I have read where rechargeable NiMH will last much longer than this. I have ordered some so I will soon know.
The camera seems to be more sensitive to movement than my 35mm Nikon. Probably because of shutter speed.
Knowing what I do now I would check out some of the other cameras a little closer before I purchased this one again.
It may be that the short comings of this camera are typical of digital cameras in this price range.
