            I used to work for a very large (22 franchise) dealer in Virginia.  We had a Kia dealership too.  Kia would finance anyone, but we all joked about not wanting to sell them because you would be trampled by complaint phone calls.  Honda customers called with referrals, Kia customers called with curses.  One saleslady had a Sportage breakdown on the curb minutes after the customer purchased it.  I had a young fellow in a loaner car on and off for three months directly after he purchased his Kia.
The dealership has since sold the Kia franchise for lack of profits over customer satisfaction.<br><br>
