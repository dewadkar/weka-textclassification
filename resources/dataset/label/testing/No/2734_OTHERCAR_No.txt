            The Suburban has a lot of good qualities, the 42 gallon gas tank was great, not having to worry about fill ups
on long trips, the space was great and comfort was exceptional.
However we traded this vehicle in after only putting 34,000 miles on it. 
We had a strong concern about the brakes. In the time we owned the vehicle we had to replace the front brakes twice, the second time we had to replace the rotors as well. It was proven to us that the rotors were not able to be
resurfaced more than once resulting in having to replace them after the second set of brakes. These brakes were 
replaced before they got to the brake squealers because the shimmy was so bad when they were applied.The rotors were just turned the minimum amount because there was no ware on them.  It was explained to us that the reason was because the rear brakes were not calibrated through the anti-lock system to share the load of stopping the vehicle, resulting in the front brakes wearing three times as quick as the rear. When the third set of pads where put on the front the back brakes still had more than 50% ware left on them. 
When the front brakes locked up on a wet road while having to make a sudden stop, convinced us that there was 
definitely a safety concern.
At this point we had not decided to trade the vehicle in. It was when we tried to convince the dealership there was a problem resulting in no concern or positive response, prompting us to call the manufacture which did listen and give
us a case # to research the matter but still resulting in an unsafe situation without resolution. 
We were told if there was a problem that needed to be changed due to manufacture engineering we would be refunded
for the expense of replacing them twice. So Far, over a year later we have herd nothing.

This was our experience and we also were told by the manufacture and the dealership that it was not uncommon 
for the front brakes to ware at such a rapid rate because of the weight.
