            The 1999 Dodge Stratus is a huge improvement over the 1998 model. Still the car has many problems. The car is a good ride and has some neat features to go along with the look. The sound system is great and has great bass. Some of the problems I've encountered were the brakes. I had to get my brake pads changed because of the noise they would make when I would stop. I had to do this twice under 25,000 miles!! I'm not sure how long this car will last, but it's getting where I need to go. If you are really interested in Dodge cars, I would suggest buying an Intrepid. Otherwise go with a Toyota Corrola which is more reliable. <br><br>
