            When I saw the Kia Sephia it looked so cute, I got it all hooked up with power windows and locks and a cd player. Two weeks after I get it my front passenger window gets stuck open. The power window motor broke. 

Then my gears started getting stuck. I have had the car about 4 months and already all 4 of my power window motors have broken, and of course they do it at the worst times, in July my driver window got stuck rolled up, then when it rain the back ones got stuck down. 

I have had to take it in to be fixed way to many times. The seat belts are broke now, they wont give any slack. Now I have to deal with looking for a car all over again, because I am trading this one in. I can only take so much, and I have dealt with a lot already!
