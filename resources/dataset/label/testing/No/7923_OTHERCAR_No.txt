            My fiancee and I, 20 years old, both owned 98 Saturn SC2s with all options... sunroofs, keyless entry, power everything, etc.  We wanted to go out and get new cars and we were looking at '02 Sentras and Civics.  Needless to say, we both ending up buying a '02 Civic 2-door LX.  Mine is "titanium" colored and hers is silver.. (the titanium is a metallic beige color).

We were sold on the nice body shape of the Civic, the nice interior, gas mileage, insurance, low interest rate, and a reliable car.  This car is a great, no hassle, I don't care about my car, kind of car.

Unfortunately,  we both regret buying the Hondas and miss our Saturn SC2s... why?  Because the LX doesn't have a sun roof, everyone and their mother drives new Civics in my area, and basically the car lacks any kind of character.  It excels in many areas but it isn't the best in any area either.  If we were really concerned about gas mileage, we should've bought Jetta TDIs (diesels) and get 50 MPG.  If we wanted a car with more options, we could've got an EX (out of price range) or an older, used car that's a lot cheaper.

So, the car itself is fine if you want an economy, no hassle car.  But look elsewhere if you want to have a car you truly enjoy jumping into every morning. I have almost 12,000 miles on honda now, and I plan on selling it in about a year to buy an older, used car for a lot cheaper that has some style! Maybe like a 98 Honda Prelude VTEC for about $10,000 or a 93 N/A 300ZX for $8,000.  These cars will last me just a long as a brand new Honda, but with a cheaper price tag and it would be something I actually like.  How does my girlfriend feel about her Honda?  The same way.  After driving the car for 3 months she called dealerships to see if she could trade it in for a Jetta, but obviously we are upside down because depreciation sucks the first few years of a car.

Put my feelings aside, the only other problems of the car:  Lots of wind noise from the rear glass, the entire door panel moves in and out when the power windows go up and down... was very difficult to install aftermarket CD/MP3 players, sometimes the car sounds like it doesn't want to turn over, and the gas gauge light comes on really early (still can drive about 50 miles).  I belong to a forum of Honda owners and all of the above mentioned problems are common among all 01+ Civic owners.
