            I�ve read many reviews about how nice this car rides, how the stereo sounds, how much power it has, and how pretty it is. These glowing reviews have been about low mileage examples. I�ve had the misfortune of owning one long enough for my impressions of this car to sour quite a bit due to it�s true attributes showing.

Why:
The oil pressure sensor went bad at 79,000 miles.
An engine accessory belt pulley self-destructed at 85,000 miles.
A power window motor or switch went bad at 89,000 miles.
The engine suddenly began burning a quart of oil per week at 93,000 miles.

This is the second Daimler Chrysler product I've owned.  As with the first experience I had with a Dodge Caravan years ago, I've regretted the trust I put into this company to build a decent quality vehicle.

The most aggravating and expensive problem I've had with this Intrepid is engine failure at such a young stage in the automobile's life cycle, despite exceeding the manufacturer's recommended interval for oil changes. The diagnosis: bad heads and/or valve guides. 
Engine failure at 93,000 miles is shameful.  This would have been considered high mileage in the early �80s or earlier, but not now.

I can't get an honest mechanic or rebuild shop to touch this engine because Daimler Chrysler has employed build techniques at the factory that re-builders can't duplicate, and may not be able to for some time. My only options are to buy an engine from a salvage yard or a new one from a Dodge dealership for a quoted price range of $4,000.00 to $8,000.00!  

I've picked up on some information that suggests the 2.7-liter engine used in this automobile and it's near clone, the Chrysler Concord, possibly has an engine sludge buildup problem.  I also found a class-action lawsuit Web page that is soliciting owners of these cars about premature engine failure.  It seems the feelers are being put out about the validity of such an action.

I still owe $8,000.00 on the car and have to make keep it insured in accordance with bank rules, which means I must keep "full coverage" on it, but it sits in my driveway rotting. 

If you own one of these cars, get rid of it.  If you're considering purchasing one, consider something else not made by Daimler Chrysler's Dodge/Chrysler divisions.

The other problems I mentioned I've had with this auto are common and costly repairs. The resale value is the worst I've ever seen with any automobile.

Lemons are a pretty yellow, but so bitter.
