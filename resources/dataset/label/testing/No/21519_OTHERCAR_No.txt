            I loved this car for the first year, and now I'm ready to trade it in after 2 1/2 and 40k.  What went wrong:

1) I started having electrical problems about 6 months after I bought it.  The dealership fixed them temporarily under my warranty coverage.  The list of current outstanding electrical problems includes: broken diver-side power window, non-working dash lights and a melted headlight mounting.  All totaled, it would cost me something like $1200 to fix.

2) I noticed a loud, annoying engine rattle about 8 months ago.  I was told at two dealerships that they think they know what it is but they're not sure.  They've looked at several potential sources but can't nail down a cause for the noise.  In the end, I passed on their offers to dig further for $160 without a guarantee that they would be able to fix it.

3) I noticed the engine running roughly about 4 months ago, took it to the dealership and found out the camshaft adjusting valve was faulty.  It took 3 trips to the dealership to diagnose and fix the problem.  It was under warranty so my only cost was time and headaches.  Lucky me.

4) About 2 weeks ago I turned the key and it wouldn't start.  After a 20-mile tow to the dealership and 2 days in the shop without a car, I find out the fuel pump is faulty.  Of course it's not under warranty anymore and it will cost $874 to replace, but the dealership will generously give me a loaner for the next week and a half while they wait for a part.

In summary, I'm not too happy with my VW.
