            As a long-time film based picture taker, I had resisted the urging of friends and family to "go digital" for years. But one day I saw the Toshiba promoted at what seemed to be a good price ($249) and impulsively ordered it. It was easy to use out of the box, though the included ACDSee software was fairly basic.
I am pleased with the detail of the pictures, but find that the colors are very inconsistent (I got some GREEN people in an outdoor summer scene and unduly warm and yellow indoors.) Were it not for Photoshop, I would be frequently unhappy with my pictures. The white balance adjustment is only "OK." I shouldn't need to spend so much time "rescuing" my pictures with Photoshop.
As other reviewers have noted, shutter lag is just awful. Taking pictures of my 14 month old granddaughter is nearly impossible, as she is often out of the picture by the time the shutter fires! For landscapes and posed pictures, though, the pictures are often excellent.
On the plus side, I think the detail with the all glass lens and 3.2 megapixel CCD is excellent, and I have made some really nice shots that print up to 5x7. I haven't tried 8x10, but I expect that they would be good as well.
What's worst, after just 6 month the camera died. It wouldn't power up and I had to return it to Toshiba AT MY EXPENSE (I understand the limits of warantees.) To their credit, they have a 48 hour 'Express Exchange' option whereby you send them your camera and they replace it within 48 hours, though it might be with a reconditioned one.
