            I was very keen to get into the world of digital photography, but this camera nearly turned me away from it for good.
I brought the MX-1200 as part of a deal with my new printer, the annoying little sales man assured me it was a "top little camera" and that I would be very happy with it. Why did I listen to that stupid little man?
The MX-1200 is not a good buy despite its low price tag, sure it does have a few good points, but my personal opinion is that you should save for a couple more months and by something where the pros outweigh the cons.

I must admit that this is a very temping price (hey I bought it) and there are some situations where this camera might be the ideal purchase. For example, if you only want a camera to use around the home then the MX-1200 might just do the job, but if your thinking of taking it out into the field or on holiday then look elsewhere. This camera has a painfully short battery life, so if you plan on being to far from the nearest power outlet be prepared to spend a fortune on batteries. Turning off the LCD screen will help to conserve power, but then, what's the point? 

The packaged software is just plain awful; it has minimal features and takes forever to load anything, so you may want to have a separate program like PhotoShop.
The other disappointing feature is the zoom, you can choose between normal or ridiculously close.
Other letdowns include the small media card, most shots come out blurred, no USB, and there seems to be a high error or failure rate with the uploading.

One thing worth mentioning if your planing on getting the MX-1200 is that the only way to get really crisp pictures is to leave the flash on for every shot. I don't know why but it just works.

So heres the deal, if your looking for a first camera then this might be okay depending on what you want to do with it, but I do warn you that it might just as easily put you off the world of digital photography for good.
