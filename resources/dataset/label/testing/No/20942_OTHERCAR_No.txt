            I bought this vehicle because it looked really cool.  I loved it just looking at it.  There are many drawbacks to this car.  It comes with a 4 cylinder engine.  For what you pay for it, it should be at least a 3.8 V6, because it needs the meat behind it, there is no meat behind it.  The car is a tease.  It looks like it would be a speed demon, but it is actually as slow as a duck.  It is roomy for a compact car.  Another drawback is, everyone looks at the car, and I always see finger prints on the windows, and on the doors of the car, due to people's curiosity.  So there is another draw back.  One other is that this car is in such demand, it took me 5 months just to finally get it.  I believe that this car is just a waste of 25 grand.  That is how much many places are asking.  I believe no one should buy this car.  Too much for what it is.<br><br>
