                 My dad bought a 1993 Mercury Topaz in 1995 for my use when I was fifteen years old.  It has been one pain after another.  It gets terrible gas mileage, and almost everything that can go wrong with a car has gone wrong with mine.  Keep in mind that I am no mechanic, and have a limited knowledge of cars.  I only know that the number of repairs and the amount of money that I have put into my car has been exorbitant in the eyes of moi.  My car was at the mechanic's for one reason or another (other than routine tire, brake, and oil changes) at least four or five times a year.
        I have had to replace two motor mounts.  I've replaced the harmonic wheel balancer twice.  I've replaced the master cylinder.  I don't know the details surrounding this repair, but I know that I went without air conditioning for an entire Louisiana summer until I could afford to spend a pile of money to fix it.  I cannot even remember all of the things I have had to have repaired.  
        My &quot;power windows&quot; were a joke.  The back right window has never gone up or down.  The passenger and driver's side windows both only worked if assisted with one hand while pressing the button with the other.  My struts (sort of like shocks are far as I understand) were in dire need of replacement.  Riding in my car was comparable to turbulence on an airplane riding through a tornado.  Not that I would know...I'm making that up, but you understand what I'm saying.  I had to slow to almost a stop before hitting even a slight bump if I wanted to avoid banging my front end against the ground.  
        You may wonder why I'm referring to my car in the past tense.  It has been suffering for a long time and now it is finally dead.  My little brother did me the favor of flipping my car into a ditch while I was on vacation, so I can look for a better car.  I only hope that my insurance company doesn't find out what a piece of junk my little Topaz was.  I'd like to have a fat little check so that I can get a decent car.  
        I am a college student, and I have spent $500 this summer only on major repairs to my car.  I had planned to save the money I made working this summer to go toward housing in the fall.  Thanks to my Topaz, I will have to resort to student loans, something I had hoped to avoid like the plague.  
        In summation, don't buy this car.  Not unless you're looking for an excuse to spend inordinate amounts of time with your local mechanic.  <br><br>
