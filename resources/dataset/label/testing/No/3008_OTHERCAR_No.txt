            Okay, I bought a Geo Metro as my first car a couple of years back.  I was making $4.65 per hour and driving 125 miles per day roundtrip so I needed something that was cheap, had great gas mileage and new so that I didn't have to spend all of my time in the shop.  The Geo Metro fit into my budget at that time.  

The Geo Metro is made by Chevrolet in an attempt to compete with similiar car models in the US that get great gas mileage and are frequently used by high mileage work travelers or high school kids needing their first car.  It's competition, in my opinion, are cars like the Toyota Tercel and Ford Escort.

I enjoyed my Metro believe it or not.  It is only three cyclinders and didn't burn rubber when you left the stop light but I consistently drove it 85 or 90 and after 45,000 miles, it hadn't given me once bit of a problem.  Then it happened..............I wrecked it........

I was going UNDER 10 mph at a green light turning and another car ended up hitting me.  The other car might have been going 20 mph, if that.  This is where I have my problem with the Geo Metro.  It is NOT safe in an accident.  Going 10 mph, I totalled my Geo Metro beyond repair.  The whole front of the car was laying in the street and there was styrofoam blowing everywhere....Styrofoam, I didn't even realize that the padding for the bumper of my car was styrofoam.  The whole front of the car was destroyed and since the car is so small, it easily bent the frame of the car, which is what totalled the car.

The second thing that I didn't like was the fact that my insurance company didn't cover near enough on the value of the car and it left me majorly upside down.  Even the dealership was no help in raising the value of the car.  Their perspective was that it is a cheap car, deal with it.  

I will recommend the Geo Metro if you travel great distances and want the fuel economy.  I emplore you to look at the safety features and reports to determine if saving some money is worth the increase risk in your life.  It's a great little car but there are also other great cars out there that have more safety equipment installed.  Saving a few bucks on gas and payment isn't worth losing your life is you have a serious wreck.<br><br>
