            I bought this vehicle because it fit my size requirements and was in my price range.  The best part about this vehicle is that the top goes down and the 6 cylinder engine roars.  Otherwise, I've paid to fix just about everything else on this car. Last year, I wrote a letter to Chevrolet about the all of the malfunctioning parts on this car and they never responded!  It seems that once you buy the car, they do not care about providing good service  to the customer.  It only has 60,000 miles and it just keeps breaking and breaking!  For starters, the door locks (door lock actuator) have never worked!  I've paid to have them fixed five times.  I finally just disconnected the automatic door locks.  I've replaced the window motor in the driver's side door twice.  The manifold gasket set had to be replaced to the tune of 400.00.  Mysteriously, the coolant light goes on if I turn left but no repair shop has been able to find a leak in the system.  Go figure.  These are just some of the nightmares with this car.  If you should see a car like mine on a used car lot, I wouldn't buy it.  Except of course, if it really is mine, then you should buy it because I've already paid to fix just about everything except the motor.<br><br>
