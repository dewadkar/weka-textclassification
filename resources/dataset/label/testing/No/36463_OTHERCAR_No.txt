            As a previous "Honda" girl (3 civics) I decided with my next purchase I would go all out.  My father had a Nissan king cab pickup truck that took him 230,000 miles and 15 years to run in the ground with little hassle or major problems so based on reviews and his experience with Nissan I thought lets try it out.  First I purchased the SE V6 2002 Nissan Altima in October of 2001.  I got the leather package, with the digital temp control feature, the spoiler, the fog lights and the BOSE 6 disc in dash stereo system.  So excited on my drive home from the dealership, that V6 sure has a lot more punch than that little 155 horsepower civic I just got rid of.  Within a month I was back at the dealership with rattling in my stereo speakers.  This noise was not when the stereo was cranked but certainly audible while listening to CDs.  I waited two hours to be told that there was nothing they could do and the service man suggested I go to a specialized store to have insulation installed in the doors.  Fine, I guess I will have to deal with it considering the amount per month I am paying for the car I don't have the extra cash to have that done.  Within the next month I notice that the finish on the driver's side door is starting to peel off.  I have only used a clean water damp cloth in the cleaning/dusting of the interior.  No chemicals.  After driving all the way back up to the dealership they tell me they will have to order a new door panel, meanwhile I notice that the wood trim on the passenger door (where the auto window buttons are) is painted black where you would put change.  That black paint was scratching off exposing the wood finish underneath, making it look cheap.  SO they ordered that part.  Two weeks later the parts come in and that month I notice the CD storage door under the stereo doesn't open the way it should.  You are supposed to press the door a little bit and it should pop open well this one only opened halfway.  SO when I went back to have the driver's door panel and the passenger�s wood finish replaced I mentioned this (of course they have to order parts).  Come to find out the door panel was crushed in shipping and they have to order another one, but they did replace the passenger�s wood panel window button thing.  Two weeks/a month later I am back up there with the expectation that the door panel issue will be fixed.  They replace the door panel and the CD door panel and it works just fine, for 3 days.  I deal with it for another month until I have the time to go back up there with the same complaint on the CD door panel.  Come to find out the center console that runs between the two front seats is warped, apparently installed that way.  They order a new console to replace the warped one.  Two weeks later it arrives and I go to have it installed.  After four hours I am told that they put in the new console but they will have to replace the "boot" wooden piece that my manual gear shift sticks out of.  So I am driving around for three weeks with the "leather" that is attached to the underside of the gear knob and not attached to the "boot".  The boot comes in and I drive all the way back up there to have it installed, and after two hours I find out that the gearshift knob was installed with loc-tight, a industrial strength glue and they can't get it off to install the boot, with out destroying it.  So they have to order a gearshift knob.  And I point out to the service man the door panel they replaced is sticking out from the window and he pretty much blew me off.  So here I am two more weeks till the part comes in and another two weeks after that before I can get back up there.  1 week before going to the dealership for that (August 2002), while I was pulling out of my drive way I hear an awful cracking/breaking noise.  I stop my vehicle immediately and get out to investigate.  The driver's side of the bumper has broken where the rivets would hold it in place on the metal fender and the bumper is now sticking out approximately 2 to 3 inches.  This was a stress fracture; I did not hit anything in my driveway.  I investigated the underside of the car and there is no damage, only to the holes that held the bumper in place.  This is where I am at now.  My resale value on this car will be nil if I can't keep it together.  None of the Hondas I owned (brand new too) did anything like this to me.  I am extremely disappointed in this vehicle and wish there was a way to get out from under it.
