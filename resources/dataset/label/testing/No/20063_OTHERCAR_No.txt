            We special ordered our loaded 1996 SLT 4WD 4 door, taking delivery in May 1996.  Fit and finish were very good.  There were no defects out of the box.  The first thing we noticed was an inaccurate fuel gauge.  The engine would flame out with just less than 1/4 tank indicated.  It was replaced with another sending unit under warranty, but this did not solve the problem.  A redesigned sending unit was installed which has functioned perfectly. 38,000 - radiator leaks at transmission cooler fittings - $125. At just over 40,000 miles the fuel pump failed - $500.  At 50,000 miles the transmission (4L60E) failed - $1200 with a 50% GM participation.  The rebuild lasted 300 miles before it failed again.  This time the entire unit was replaced with a factory GM rebuilt unit at no additional cost. All intake manifold gaskets replaced for oil leaks - $300.  At 51,000 the brake lights and hazard lights stopped working.  Diagnosed as a failed turn signal switch - $300. I just replaced the 72 month battery at the 48 month mark and we are on our third EGR valve at 51K miles!  Likes: Roominess, road visibility, crash worthiness.  Dislikes: Reliability, economy, turning radius, rear door windows only go down a few inches - my kids HATE them.
We expected more from this vehicle.<br><br>
