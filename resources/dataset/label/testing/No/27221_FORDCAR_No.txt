I really loved this car...it was small and fun...

until...

the cowl cover cracked and it leaked into the passenger footwell every time it rained or I went to the car wash

moisture entered the headlight and it needed to be replaced

the cruise control stopped functioning

the rear wheel bearings needed to be replaced due to a recall

the wiper motor stopped working in the winter and needed to be replaced

and before I owned it it needed:

new brake pads and rotors despite having less than 15,000 miles

a new transmission and associated cooling hoses

a new hatch strut

and finally, after only having it 7 months and still being well within original factory warranty, it caught fire all by itself by a recall that happened 4 months after my incident. It ended up being totaled. See the pictures at http://www.geocities.com/archangel_jjn

So far, Ford's basic response is that it is an insurance issue... so if you think your car is protected by factory warranty against catastrophic failure, even from an issue covered by a recall, think again...they'll leave you out swinging in the breeze, and you're left with only your insurance payout on the rapidly shrinking book value to pick up and start over.
