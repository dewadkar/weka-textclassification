            In May of 1994, I bought a 94 "stripper" Tercel. I figured I might lose my job and have to travel as a job shopper (contract) engineer and would need the most reliable economical car available. Consumer Reports showed that the Tercel was about 60% more reliable than the average small car. So I looked for a Tercel.

And my local dealership had a take-it or leave-it special on some cars, at about a grand below sticker. It was a teal (greenish) manual 4-speed 2-door with no power steering, no air, no radio, ... a true stripper. I later put after- market cruise control on it and replaced the 145-80-13's with 155-80-13 All Weathers. 
 
I liked the little rascal, it got almost 45 mpg on trips. But it was hard to see out of, you had to crane your neck to see around the rear view mirror and I had some "surprises" when I came to a 4-way stop and was startled by someone at the 3 o'clock position.

But it was durable. The only real problem was the Mass Atmospheric Pressure sensor crapping out at 14,000 miles (replaced under warrantee but I think I prematurely cooked the exhaust pipe when it ran rich in default mode back to the dealer.) At almost 9 years of use, I am still on the original battery!!! (Amazing when Sear's Diehards only seem to last 2 out of their 5-year guarranteed life.)

So what is the rub? In previous years, it's been snowy in the winter but relatively free from slush. This winter we've had a lot and the Tercel with relatively new All Weather tires has got me into a lot of trouble. Just driving down a road at 35 mpg with some new slush on the road caused the tail of the car to come around. It was in slow motion and I tried to get it back in-line but couldn't and it did a 180 and backed into a telephone pole at about 10 miles per hour causing $100 of damage to the trunk and bumper. 

But last night did it. I was driving on an entrance ramp to the expressway and came around a blind turn to see a line of cars backed up and stopped. I had to brake which started  the car's rear to fishtail around. I couldn't speed up to help pull the rear back in-line. The car did a 180 ACROSS 4 LANES OF HIGHWAY before coming to a halt with me looking north at the oncoming southbound traffic at the side of the road. It was a miracle that I wasn't killed. (A driver of an SUV gunned it to just avoid me as I careened across the lanes.) Admittedly the road conditions were poor but I'm getting the distinct impression that this thing easily spins out when it gets up on slush or granular "corn" snow. Snow tires with generous void space and studs might help, although my rear tires still have legal tread depth. Some knowledgeable people say that light front-wheel drive cars' rear tires just can't hang on when it gets super slick in slush conditions and soft-compound snow tires with deep tread are an absolute must.
Update Dec 16, 2003:
I've put Nordman snowtires on all four wheels and have been running them for one month. No visible wear, a squirmier ride, a little "buzzier" noise, but these tires have done a good job on plowing through some heavier snow and slush in the last week. You really need snows, especially on a little car when the going gets rough!!!
