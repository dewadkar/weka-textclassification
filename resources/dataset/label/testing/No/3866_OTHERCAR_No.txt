            You think this GMC Yukon sounds nice? Well you will find out a different story when you drive it for a while! I have a good friend who recently made the mistake of buying this SUV. He has been complaining about this and that constantly with it. I drove in it a few times and I see nothing really wrong with it, that was until transmission started going out in it. I understand that he is not the only un-lucky one that this has happened to. On all the facts and results that I have seen, I would have to say that this is a very poor example of the SUV's that are out there. I suggest that you look at other choices versus the Yukon. This is a really big purchase so I suggest you make the right one and not choose the Yukon.<br><br>
