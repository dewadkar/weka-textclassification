            	I recently purchased an Agfa CL30 in order to photograph the T-shirts I sell and upload them onto our company�s website. The camera was featured in the MacConnection catalog, and since we had been buying all of our other computer equiptment from MacConnection, we decided to go with that one. The Agfa experience started off on the wrong foot, because although it  had been paid for, months went by without the arrival of the camera. Of course, I can�t blame Agfa for this, but as you�ll be able to tell from this review, it may have been wisest to take this absence as an omen and go with another type of digital camera. As it turned out, we naively went out to WalMart and purchased it for $250.00, which seemed like a good enough deal until we started using it.
	If you read Schmeck's review, you already know about the unbelievable financial drain batteries become when using the Agfa CL30. Schmeck's description is in no way a stretch of the truth - I was shocked at how many I went through. I followed all of the directions to a T, and the life was continually being sucked out of the thing. I eventually gave up on batteries and relied solely on the AC adaptor, so I'm stuck with taking my pictures near the outlet. I could have dealt with being limited in mobility if the other aspects of the camera weren't as big of an inconvenience as they've turned out to be. Some problems I have encountered are: I have to restart my iMac everytime I plug the camera into the computer to transfer images. I thought the USB serial port would prevent me from having to do this, but such was not the case. With some difficulty, however, I got the software to work. Once it was running, I was relatively pleased with the program - the pictures transfer quickly and export to Photoshop easily. The quality of the pictures, however, leave something to be desired; the colors were dramatically different from the objects I photographed, and obviously, the camera didn�t respond well to anything less than an ideal lighting situation. What�s odd is that my lighting was consistent for all of the pictures I took (remember - I was stuck against the electrical outlet, so all of the the T-shirts were in the same position when photographed) but some of them were highly �overexposed� looking. A glare that didn�t exist in real life mars the graphics of quite a few of the photos, and that�s detrimental when the image is trying to convey the graphic design of a shirt.
	Then, about three weeks after our Agfa CL30 purchase, it died. The camera had lain dormant in its case for three or four days with everything turned off. And nothing I did would turn it back on. I blamed my own lack of know-how and turned to other, more electronically experienced members of our office team, who came to the finely honed opinion that the thing just sucked. I�m a quick trip back to WalMart (for an exchange) later, and the newer camera is holding up fine. The quirks of the brand still plague the CL30, but I�m used to them now, and I plan on just exchanging it for a new one every couple of months or so until I discover a camera I�m really impressed with - and that�s where everybody else�s reviews come in. 
	For examples of the shoddy photographs taken by the Agfa CL30, check our website and click on the �detailed picture� link. The Mudhoney designs turned out especially poorly and are a great example of the annoying glare cited above. <br><br>
