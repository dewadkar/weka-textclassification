            I bought this van from a friend in Oct 2001 after my beloved Ford Aerostar was written off in an accident.  My wife LOVES this van and even though I gnaw my teeth at night waiting for a major repair job to come she would rather fix it than replace it.

Pros:
- driving position, seats, controls
- responsive handling.  The Ford was a truck, this is a car.  Last year the handling saved our lives when I had to avoid an out-of-control semi-trailer on the interstate.  
- quiet - for a van I can't believe that we can converse on the highway without shouting.
- sound system - the six speaker Infinity sound system is one of the best I've heard.  My son's scout friends love to ride in this van on trips as they can listen to their favourite (not mine) music all the way up with little distortion and great bass.

Cons:
- reliability - I haven't had the transmission go yet but have numerous problems with electronics, especially door switches, rear bakes, A/C, trim falling off.
- fuel economy - only one mini-van gets worse mileage and that's the Kia Sedona.  My Aerostar had a 4.1 litre engine and got much better fuel economy that the 3.8 litre in the T&C.
- flimsy construction - ripped the new bumper easily on a parking berm and getting rust in body wherever small dents and scratches are.

Recommendation:
Unless you want a Honda or Toyota this is the best American minivan to buy (even though its made in Canada by a German owned company).  The 2000+ year models are a huge improvement in reliability according to Consumer Reports.
