            I bought a new 1999 mitsubishi galant because the price is very reasonable for such a beautiful car. I  am very pleased with the car. It is a beautiful looking car, a sporty sedan. I made it look real great with all the extras I have added to it. It is a smooth ride, and handles great. The 4cyl engine is not enough pep for me but its acceptable. The  main reason why I write this e-pinion is because I have had a lot of electrical problems with the car. It has been in the dealer 6 times in 12 months. First the AC wasn't working, then the windows didnt open. A month later the fog lights didnt work. Three weeks later the dashboard light wasn't on. I had the car for a few months then wipers had problems.  Then I got a letter about the recall about a wiring problem. So be careful with the electric part of the car. All in all it is very comfortable, looks great, it is a quiet and smooth ride, but electric wiring has me upset. I really wish this car didn't have the electrical problems it does because it is the only reason why i wouldn't recommend it. I hope that this is only a personal experiance, for all of you hoping to buy a 99 Galant. Please feel free to contact me and let  me know about your 1999 Galant.<br><br>
