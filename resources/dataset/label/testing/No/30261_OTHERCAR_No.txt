            When I purchased my computer from IBM, I had the choice of choosing a free scanner or digital camera. I chose the free AGFA ePhoto Smile Camera-bad choice.

I had problems from the start with the program-AGFA said call IBM-IBM said call Microsoft-Microsoft said call AGFA. Finally got a friend, who is more computer literate than I, to get me up and running. 

The camera uses (2) AA batteries-USES being the optimal word. I went thru 6 batteries in a period of a few hours, trying to take pictures and downloading.  Finally went to Radio Shack and bought a DC adapter and that problem was solved.

To be brief and to the point-pictures are grainy and dark. Tried various locations and lighting. It is almost impossible to get a decent picture indoors, even with flash. When you do get something that is recognizable you will spend a great deal of time &quot;cleaning&quot; it up. Bout the only way you are going to get a acceptable photo is outdoors in direct sunlight-forget cloudy or overcast days.

I contacted AGFA via EMail and their excuse was this was a beginner's camera and if I wanted better resolution they had other cameras I could purchase.....I just want some resolution-even a beginner should be entitled to a decent photo....who does their marketing!?!

I am disappointed in IBM at even being associated with this product. It has lowered their credibility and my opinion of their services.

You get what you pay for? NOT!  Had I purchased this camera, I would have at the least expected to take a picture that was recognizable...Now you know why it was FREE.
