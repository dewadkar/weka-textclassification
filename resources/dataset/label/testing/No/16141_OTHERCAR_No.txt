            I purchased my 2000 GC Laredo last October.  I waited for about a month, for I had ordered the Laredo with specific options that I really wanted that were fairly rare on Laredos like a leather interior and a V8 engine.  Since I new I was going to be using nothing but synthetic oil I was going to wait until I had approximately 5000 miles on the odometer and then start the oil changes with Mobil 1 10/30 motor oil.  I took the Jeep into a local oil change establishment at about 5100 miles.  As I was sitting in the waiting room a mechanic came in and showed me something that made me almost physically ill.  He showed me a cap that had a pale yellow sludge adhering to the inside of the cap along with what seemed to be about a teaspoon's worth of water.  What I though was a bearing ended up being the oil fill cap !!!  I was beside myself.... I immediately called the dealer from which I had purchased the Jeep and explained to him that this yellow sludge certainly had to be the result of a mix of oil and water which the mechanics agreed.  This sludge and water was not only on the inside of the cap, but also down inside the neck of the oil fill assembly.  I was promised that I would not void my warranty by driving the Jeep back to the dealership.  They took the Jeep and gave a me rental.  The dealer said he would speak with Chrysler and get back with me as soon as possible.  On the way home the dealer called me with what he termed an &quot;explanation&quot;..... He said that Chrysler was aware of a problem that happens with the V8 engines especially new ones that have not had their first oil change and that is this:  Due to a combination of very cold temperatures, 5 to 15 degrees F, and constant highway speed driving, 65-75 mph, that a rush of very cold air over the front part of the engine including the oil fill assembly combined with the heat of the V8 engine produces a certain amount of condensation inside the neck and cap of the oil fill assembly.  I was told that it was not a problem to be concerned about.  The dealership cleaned out the cap and neck of the oil fill assembly and I picked up the Jeep the next morning.  I arrived a second time at the local oil change establishment to have my oil changed.  When I told the mechanics about Chrysler's explanation they just smiled and said....&quot;Be sure to get the extended warranty&quot;.  In the end I know what I saw.  It wasn't &quot;condensation&quot;, it was a good teaspoon's worth of water inside my oil fill cap and who know's how much made it down to my engine.  Cracked blocks and blown gaskets were ruled out by the dealer, but I will be keeping tabs on this and will let you know soon.<br><br>
