            We did not buy the Chevy Corsica off the lot.  My brother had it when we went to visit him in CA and my mom and I drove home in it and my parents took over the payments.
The car is good for small town travel, but when you travel from CA, and to and from AR and OK everyday the car is not that great!   It does not have cruise control which makes it eat up gas if you go over a lot of hills, the seat belts are on the door and they don't have adjustable ones so the seat belts are always digging into your neck.  In ours some fuse blew out and we don't have an inside light, the radio don't stay on one station when you turn it off, and the clock does not work.
If you travel around a lot, like we do, the front axal starts to sound like the tires are going to fall off!  We still have the Corsica and I told my friends that the car is running on prayer power!
So, if you're looking for a car to do some traveling in, don't go for the Corsica, it won't hold up very long.   If you're looking just for a town car, the Corsica would be a good choice.   
If you do buy it and you do a lot of traveling, turn up the radio because you won't want to hear the tires sounding like they're about to role off the axal!
