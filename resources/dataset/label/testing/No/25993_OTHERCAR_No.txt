            Read the list of cavaliers available for review here on Epinions and you'll get the picture:  <i>1991 Cavalier, 1992 Cavalier, 1993 Cavalier, 1994 Cavalier, 1995 Cavalier, 1996 Cavalier, 1997 Cavalier, 1998 Cavalier, 1999 Cavalier, 2000 Cavalier (and soon to come, the 2001 Cavalier)</i>.  Message: if you want to go with the old and predictable, the cavalier is the way to go.

<b>The Cavalier is not cavalier</b>

Here are the relevant meanings that my dictionary gives to the word &quot;cavalier&quot;: haughty, easy, offhand, supercilious, disdainful.  How well does the 2000 Cavalier live up it its name?

I've driven many different Cavaliers in my time.  I've even owned one.  Most recently rented the 2000 Cavalier on a business trip.  The only difference I can see between them is that the tail lights look a little different and the newer ones have less rust.  Otherwise, they're all the same.  How can a design so old still hang on to the name &quot;Cavalier&quot;?

Haughty?  I suppose it is haughty of Chevrolet to keep on pumping this old beast out.  Easy?  This car is easy to drive only for the first few thousand miles.  Then the driver will tire of the crunching transmission, the squeaking breaks and the mysterious body sounds that appear without reason.

Offhand, I'd say that the Cavalier is designed for the American driver who doesn't know any better.  It's disdainful of its passengers, with poorly designed seats that give really weird support in places that don't need it.  Two-door or four-door, the Cavalier is an awkward compromise, without enough room for those who need like to ride large with lots of space, and with too much room for those who want an efficient city car.  In the city, whether you're driving with manual or automatic transmission, you'll find that you're wasting a lot of gas.  The Cavalier belongs to the old school of gas-hogging Detroitmobiles that's designed for the economy of GM, not the economy of the driver.

Supercilious?  Well, that's just another word for arrogant (my dictionary puts it as &quot;haughtily contemptuous&quot;.  This would be the attitude of the sales representative who actually gets someone to buy this car.  With crude control of the driving and the interior environment alike, the Cavalier doesn't seem to trust its driver enough to give up control.  If you get this Cavalier, you'll be returning to the dealership quite a bit for repairs, so you'll have the chance to get to know your supercilious sales representative in great detail.

<b>In Sum</b>

The Cavalier is for the 1990s what the K Car was for the 1980s - predictably low in quality.  Back in the 80s and early 90s, the American public couldn't do that much about it.  Things are different now.  Detroit has finally wised up to the fact that it needs to build cars that drive well and get good gas mileage.  

Get one of America's new generation of cars, or better yet, get yourself a Japanese gas-electric hybrid.  For real performance, look to the future, not to the cavalier past.<br><br>
