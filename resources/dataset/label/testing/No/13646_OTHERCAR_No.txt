            After buying a 1997 4x4 5-speed Kia Sportage new and trading it in for the 1998 5-speed 4x4 model, we looked forward to enjoying the same good interior, handling, practicality and good looks of the previous model.  The addition of a passenger-side airbag, and an easier to open rear gate, are pluses over the previous models.

Having compared the Kia to the RAV4 at the time(weaker engine and horrible interior), the Honda CRV(pedals and shift felt awkward), we felt we had a good value for the money.

A true 4x4, we have actually driven our Kia offroad to visit friends who live in unpaved rural areas, and the little Kia- that-could always came through. Even over streams or ditches.

The seats are not only comfortable, but use nicer cloth than on a lot of similar vehicles. The mileage we got averaged 22 city/highway, not bad for a true four-wheel drive. Besides, the separate shift for 4-wheel high and 4-wheel low is cool. 

HOWEVER, as with our previous Kia, the electrical system is prone to problems. Major ones.

1997 model: lurched and died, had it fixed after several attempts by dealer.

1998 model: "Oh, they fixed that wiring issue, it should be fine." Foolish us, we believed the dealer's mechanics(who should know, right?)

Fast forward a few years, and it is serviced for the same problem. Forward to late 2003, and the headlights go out. No it's not the bulb, not the fuse, it's the wiring.  And they can't fix it. Maybe if we write a blank check they will try, no guarantees.

Footnote:  We bought an extended warranty at the time of purchase from the dealer serviced through HondaCare.  After using it a few times, we were told that they were 'not going to provide any more service'. Too many claims.  My wife commented 'I didn't know it was an insurance policy instead of a warranty'.  Gee, and I always liked Honda. 

We wound up trading it in for the much-improved 2004 Toyota Rav4(see review).

Good news: Newer Kias have a 10 year 10,000 mile warranty. 
Bad news: They apparently need them.
Based on our experience, I would be hesitant to recommend this otherwise decent vehicle.
