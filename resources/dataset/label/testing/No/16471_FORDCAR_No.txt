             I own a Ford Ranger.  It is a love-hate relationship.  This truck has never failed to start.  On the other hand, I have had myriad mechanical difficulties with it. Small things, like wires, fuses, and that damn check-engine light that comes on at 50,000 miles even if theres nothing wrong!  Also, it gets pretty awful gas mileage.  But it wasn't overly expensive (for a truck) and it's great being able to haul any kind of stuff.  Overall, I would say that I do not regret buying and owning it, but it has provided me with a few headaches. Just remember if you get one, that if your check engine light comes on at 50,000 miles, you may not need to pay for pricy repairs!<br><br>
