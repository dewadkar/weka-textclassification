            I have had many problems both with the body and the engine.  Many of my car�s problems are related to the sensors, which I have been told by a Volkswagen repair person is not uncommon for this model.  Please see the list of 13 repairs I have had since I received my car in April of 1999:

During the first two years of my lease the car was covered under warranty and obviously I did not have to pay for any repairs.  However, I was inconvenienced by taking the car to the dealer for service for a day or longer each time something went wrong and finding alternate means of transportation.  Now that the car is no longer under warranty the repairs are my responsibility and are costly.  

This Jetta is 3 years old and it should not have this many repair issues.  The point of leasing a new car is to avoid car repairs and payments above and beyond my lease payment.

I am very unhappy with my Jetta and its performance.  In the past I have recommended this car to others but I will not do that in the future.  In fact, I will warn potential car buyers to stay away from Volkswagens unless they want to constantly be in the repair shop.  I am currently looking at options to relinquish my lease and buy a more reliable car.
