            After driving Toyota cars for all my adult life, I did not think twice when I saw the Accord. I opted for the top of the line model V6 EX and ended up paying sticker price as it had just come out and the dealers were still maintaining a waiting list and deposits and so on. I chose the Accord when I almost had bought the Camry V6 XLE but like the originality of the new Accord which seemed superior than Camry in more than one way.

Now after 37,000 miles and quite a few long road trips as well as unscheduled trips to my dealerships, I realize that if someone wants to spend $27k+ on a car, they should go for some other brand. At the time the Accord was bought, the new TL was not out there, but now, I would go for the TL if I had to do it all over again. 

My Accord has a powerful smooth V6 which always puts grin on my face when I make it work hard. Brakes are excellent and it is fairly quiet (not comparing it with my ES300). The stereo could be much better and to my greatest surprise, I found (after I got delivery of the car) that it had no cassette player.

What troubled me are things like the fuel sending unit, power seat recliner and entire instrument cluster (most probably GM built). These items have been replaced several times and with the involvement of American Honda, the dealer has finally fixed it (but by this time, because of too many trips to the dealership, I ended switching back to my old Toyota, bought an ES300). 

Still have the Honda. Wife normally drives it.  

While the car seems to be driving fine now, The love is gone.... <br><br>
