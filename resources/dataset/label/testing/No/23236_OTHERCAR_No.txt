            Other than the sporty appearance of the Mitsubishi 3000GT, why would anyone in their right mind purchase this car?  In my opinion this vehicle lacks everything that make a sports car a sports car.  Mainly the power produced by the engine.  The pricy 3000GT SL costs over 30 grand, and produces a good 1.8 seconds slower 0-60 than the V6 Mustang which costs roughly $10,000 less.  The only type of person I would reccomend this car to is one who likes to waste their money and who hates having a sports car that actually has power.  The car's exterior is in no way worth wasting your money on the car.   I don't know what else to say other than that this car is not worth buying when you can get a cheaper vehicle with much better specifications.<br><br>
