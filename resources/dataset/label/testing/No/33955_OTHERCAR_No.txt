            My aunt leases a new one of these every two years.  Though she's a fairly small person, she likes the room inside.  She likes being able to carry three couples in comfort.  She loves the huge trunk, which can swallow whatever she captures on her shopping expeditions.  Sometimes these expeditions carry her a few hours down the road to another city.  When this happens, the smooth, quiet highway ride is very welcome.  In short, she wants in a car the things this car does very well.

That said, I think there are better choices, even in this class.  Though by no means perfect, the newly redesigned Cadillac DeVille does all of these things well and other things better.  It costs about the same.  For less money, a Buick Park Avenue does a fine job in these areas.  I would also include the large Chryslers in this review, but their significantly higher noise levels and lower levels of refinement will tend to rule them out for many people interested in this type of car.  They're really competitors in the next class down, which includes cars like the Buick Lesabre and Pontiac Bonneville.

Where does the Lincoln come up short?  Styling, as always, is subjective.  But to my eye the Lincoln is the least attractive of the lot.  Its proportions are just all wrong.  Over the years they�ve stretched the length again and again, but the wheelbase has stayed the same, and it was too short for the length of the car to begin with.  A long wheelbase with short overhangs has always looked best to my eye, and it�s currently the in thing.  The Lincoln has a short wheelbase and looong overhangs.  It used to look better (and perhaps more importantly, younger) than the Caddy or Park, but with their latest designs they have passed it.  I don�t care whose aunt you are, you�re too sexy for this car.  If style matters, the new Cadillac is where it�s at in this class.

OK, so the Lincoln looks fine to you.  But the short wheelbase means that this car does not ride as evenly as the others.  Over potholes and bumps it will tend to bobble and bound a bit.  While the Lincoln�s ride is pillowy, it tends to float and wallow in the traditional American manner much worse than the GM products now do.  The suspension strikes me as overcomplicated and likely to be unreliable and costly down the road.  I�ve seen too many older Lincolns resting on their bump stops because their air suspensions are not longer continent.

The body structure of this car is not stiff enough.  You can feel it shudder over bumps.  It lacks the all-of-a-piece feel imported luxury cars, or even the new Lincoln LS, have.  The DeVille and Park, while not up to the imports either, do better here as well.

The engine, while powerful on paper, is not quite as energetic as the Cadillac�s.  Both make the same unsophisticated roaring noises when pushed.  For leisurely driving, the supercharged six in the Park Avenue may be better than either because it excels at low-end torque.  The transmissions in all three cars are smooth.

All three cars have nicer interiors than they did in the past.  The Cadillac�s is the nicest looking, but the others are also well-appointed and luxurious.  The Continental is one of those rare cars that can comfortably seat three adults in the back seat.  In the front seat, the center position is far less comfortable than the others, but this is the case with every front seat split bench I've sat in recently.  To find a front seat that sits three comfortably you probably need a full bench, which isn't available anymore in any car as far as I know.  Maybe in a truck?

My major issue with the Lincoln interior is that the controls are overly complicated.  The suspension and steering are both driver-adjustable for firmness.  I suspect most owners never mess with the settings.  In my experience it�s best just to leave them in �normal.�  �Firm� tends to feel out of character for the car�firmness increases but feel for the road does not�while �soft� is just way too wallowy.

Frankly, none of these cars is a good value as a new car.  They all depreciate very quickly.  If this is really the type of car you want�and I can see how they would appeal to some people�then it generally makes more sense to buy one a year old.  Let someone else take the first year�s depreciation.  You�ll still have three years of warranty left on the Caddy or Lincoln.
