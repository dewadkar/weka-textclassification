            I have recently gone on a ski trip and had to sit in this horrible vehicle. Its roomy throughout the jeep but is very uncomfortable and dont wish a long road trip in this jeep on anyone. I have read up on the backround on this vehicle and it is not safe. Even though it is a big and pwerful piece of machineary it crumbles easy and is mad from cheap meatl and only looks good. Granted everyone wants a car that looks good but whats the sense if it is going to be in the shop getting fixed all the time.I have many friends who have bought this jeep and they have nothing but complaints about it. It is way over-priced and is just too expensive to make repairs on when necessary. I say buy a different car who cares what the looks are as long as it runs better than this.<br><br>
