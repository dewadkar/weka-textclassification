                 I am 16 and own a Chevrolet Cavalier.  I think this is a great car for a teen.  It looks good, very durable and is a low priced car.  It is especially good for young kids because it gets very good gas mileage as well which adds to it's low price.  It has decent power although it could be better, but that's where the Z24 comes in, which my family also owns.  If you are over 6 feet tall it may be sort of uncomfortable if you like a lot of room when you ride or drive, but otherwise it is a very good car.<br><br>
