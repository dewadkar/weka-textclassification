            I'm a bit of a weird guy. I have a soft spot for cars
that other people call ugly. Then again, I'm pug-ugly
myself, so my oddball tastes should come as no surprise.

The Toyota Echo is one of those cars others call 'ugly'.
The high roofline and funky styling give the car a bit
of verve, meaning the Echo's lines won't grow stale
any time soon.

My 1991 Toyota Corolla has been a great car, but it's
about due for replacement, so off I went to the 
dealership to test an Echo.

General Impressions
---------------------

The high roofline makes the Echo look like a much larger
car than it is. From the side, the car looks curiously 
tall and squat, and from the rear quarter reminds me 
of a 1975 Datsun B210 two-door (now there was a cheeeap
car!) 

Getting in and out of the Echo is very easy thanks to that 
high roofline. Inside the car feels spacious and airy, and
my hat's off to Toyota for designing a storage bin that slides
out from under the front passenger's seat.

What's not so great is the cheap plastic used to fit out the
interior. It's so cheap you'd think Toyota was trying to emulate
Hyundai! The fabrics used for the seating are plain and
utilitarian. As for choice of interior colours, you can
have any colour you like, as long as it's grey or beige.

Sitting in the driver's seat one finds that everything falls
to hand fairly easily. If you've ever owned a post-1989 Corolla or
Tercel, you'll find that locating the remote trunk and fuel filler
door latches are a snap in the Echo. (Hint: They're located on the
floor, just beside the driver's seat) The speedometer gauge and 
idiot lights are mounted in the centre of the dash, a lï¿½ 
Renault Twingo. Apart from all that, the dash and instrument 
panel is fairly simple and Spartan.

The driver's seat is fairly comfortable, and permits a 
commanding view of the road, much like a minivan or a truck,
even if it doesn't offer much lateral or lumbar support.

Driving Impressions
--------------------

The Echo differs from most economy cars in the sense that it 
offers the driver a high, upright position and thus a 
commanding view of the road. Rear visibility is good, but
I found I had difficulty adjusting the rearview and side mirrors
so that they gave me an optimum view of things happening behind me.

I also found it a little difficult to adjust to the high driving 
position. Inasmuch as it delivers a bit more visibility, the
high greenhouse, combined with elevated driving position made
checking blind spots a bit tricky.

In city driving, the Echo proved fairly nimble, in spite of its skinny
tires and high centre of gravity. Braking is decent if not stellar.
The same is true of acceleration. The gear shift feels rubbery and imprecise.  Over 
bumps and potholes, the car has a springy, bouncy, but 
not punishing feel, and handling isn't overly perturbed.

Highway driving, however, is a different story. The car feels jiggly
and nervous and doesn't like to take curves at a reasonable speed.
In short, the car is 'tippy'. Steering feel is also problematic
because it doesn't offer much feedback. Age aside, it's precisely
these same traits that are prompting me to consider trading in
my '91 Corolla.

In a word, the Echo is disappointing. Which is a shame, because its
exterior styling promises so much.

Miscellaneous Impressions
-------------------------

The paint job on the Echo is decent but only average. Fit
and finish elsewhere is pretty much the same.

Overall Rating: C+

It's OK as a first car, or if you're on a really tight budget
and want something offering better value/reliability than
a Kia Sephia or Rio. Or perhaps you want an urban runabout
or a second car that won't see much highway driving.

My biggest gripe with the Echo is the way Toyota strips the
base version down to such a bare-bones level you have to 
spend more money to bring it up to a usable standard. Looks 
like Toyota have taken the same nickel-and-dime approach
Detroit's Big Three have been famous for for decades.

This tendency to low-ball seems symptomatic of an industry
that is trying to deal with the fact that they've hit
what I call 'the affordability wall', and are finding they
can't make a decently-equipped, affordable but basic vehicle
and make the amount of same profit without cutting *lots* of corners.

If you ask me, asking $17,000 CDN for a decently equipped cheap
car is ludicrous. Add in taxes and you're up to $20K in a flash.

Sure, you can buy the base version for a shade under $14K, if you 
don't mind settling for a box on wheels. Any more and they'd be 
calling the seats an option!

Why didn't I buy this car? In a nutshell:

# Overpriced relative to what it offers
# Cheap interior appointments
# Poor highway manners  
# Nickel and diming customers with ultimately
  useless &quot;appearance&quot; packages<br><br>
