            I purchased a 2001 Daewoo Nubira CDX, on August 18, 2001. I paid too much for this car (17,977 Total Price). My (NEW) car remained at the Daewoo dealership for repairs from September 6, 2001 to November 5, 2001.
 
During this down period� I had the opportunity to find out what Delaware's Lemon Law statutes were. 

These are examples of (some) the problems I had:
 
*the passenger's side air bag compartment fit, it looks as if it were not installed correctly from the factory. 
*The factory moon roof has wind noise in the cabin-when it's closed the moon roof and gasket was replaced. 
*The dash pad had to be replaced and the dealership forgot to reinstall the VIN plate!!! The Regional Rep from Daewoo; indicated there was a lot a red tape to deal with in obtaining another VIN plate. 
*The hood of my car had to be replaced with the hood from another Nubira on the lot; this was due to paint imperfections that could not be repaired at an in-house or outside body shop. 
*The front bumper was removed and replaced due to necessary paint repairs. 
*When the dash pad was removed/replaced the center console and the glove box were damaged; all of these damaged items had to be replaced again!
 
The Daewoo has potential to be a terrific car. Because I  experienced all of these problems, I have many reservations about owning any product from DAEWOO. 

If you decide to purchase from this carmaker, be sure to buy from a car dealer that�s KNOWN for their quality service and customer satisfaction, service is the MAIN factor after the sell!!! 

Because of all of the ongoing problems I experienced with this particular vehicle-I have hired a Lemon Law attorney. This is the only opportunity for me to be released from this ordeal legally!

Again, I advise -BUYER�S PLEASE BEWARE.
