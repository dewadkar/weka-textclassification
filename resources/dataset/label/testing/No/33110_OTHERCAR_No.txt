            I bought this vehicle (1994 GMC Blazer-Yukon) As I have a mail run.
I needed a vehicle I could depend on and could handle the hard work it would have to do.  It was bought start of 1995, had 10,000 KM's)  It is fully loaded.
First, the only good part....I do like the way it drives and handles, that is about the only good part about it.
Since we bought this &quot;&quot;car&quot;&quot; I have had transmission problems, the first time new parts were bought and was overhauled.  The second time, more new parts, and overhauled.  The third time, new transmission from GMC. That was the Transmission problems...The windshield wiper motor went twice, replaced, and still acts up now, you turn on the turn signal, and the wipers go!!  The fuel pump has been replaced 4 times, not bad!!  The heater blower has gone 3 times.  The defroster in the back window has never worked, and the dealer could never find out what the problem was.
The water pump has gone twice.  I have had the heater blow antifreeze all through the interior of the car, what a mess that was.  Good thing we have leather seats instead of cloth!!  In the few years we have had this lemon, we paid 34,000 for it, and put out about 15,000 in repairs, and that doesn't count what was spent by the dealer when it was still under warranty!!  Oh, yes, almost forgot this one,  This is a four wheel drive, of course, three times, when needed the four wheel drive option, it would not work, had that replaced also, not bad when that what you buy a four wheeler for.
I am buying a new car this year, and you can bet your boots it will not be a Chevrolet!!!!!!
My Sister in law has a Chevrolet Astro Van, extended, she has had almost the same problems with it as we had with the Blazer, so between us, Chevrolet, you loose.....
Who should buy this vehicle, you ask, as far as I'm concerned--no one!!!
Unless of course you don't need to use it too often, and don't have to depend on it!!
