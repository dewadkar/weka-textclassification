            I bought the 600L when it first came out for around $1000 and I really regret it now.  I bought it because I liked the idea of the removable flash cards and because it had mega-pixel capabilities.  The pictures looked great, but the camera itself had intermittent problems.  Not all the features worked correctly, and after about 6 months the cameral quit working completely.  The serial download was pretty fast, but it took a real effort to get it to work.  I had to power up the camera and start the software in a certain, undocumented sequence before I could download any pics to my computer.  I am staying away from Olympus after this experience.  <br><br>
