            I have a 2001 Cabrio that I bought about a year and a half ago and it has had problem after problem. First I noticed the car did not seem to be running right. It would not speed up quickly when I pulled out and when I hit the gas it would putter before actually going. When I took it to VW...they said I was crazy - that it is a 4 cylinder and I shouldn't expect it to go better than that. Well, I knew that it wasn't right. After a year of driving it this way, I took it in again twice and finally they DID find something wrong. My car had the WRONG COMPUTER installed which had been causing this. I had been dangerously driving like this for a year and practically made fun of for complaining about it. Let's see, what else has gone wrong??? 
- Inside driver's door handle paint peels off and has had to be replaced twice now. 
- Cupholder in back seat is broken and I have never used it. 
- Loud Air leaks in roof when up - whistles AND lets water in when it rains. 
- "P" for park on gear shift was cracked, VW said they fixed it but really just stuck it together with glue, so now it is getting fixed again. 
- Chirping sound comes every time I hit a bump - small or large. 
- Brakes were squealing, so I took it in and they told me that after a year it is not under warranty for brakes. They said I need the rear rotors and brake pads replaced and I have to pay for it - $500! 

There are too many more problems to list. My car has 20,000 miles on it and I have only had it for a year and a half. I love the looks of the car, but there is no way this car should have these problems already - especially the repeated problems. I am very frustrated with this car - I would never recommend it to anyone.
