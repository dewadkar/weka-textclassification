            Prior to the Tracker I drove a Chevrolet S10 pickup truck (no extended cab), so comfort-wise the Tracker has a lot more leg room for front seat passengers as well as the driver because of the ability to move the seats back. The seats have movable armrests (able to put back or down) that are somewhat awkward because of the position in which the arm hits them-although this issue does not overwhelm the overall comfort of the front seats. The back passengers do not have a whole lot of room, but enough to be comfortable (much more than a two-door sports coupe). In its entirety, the Tracker is very comfortable for the front passengers, and I enjoy driving it on long trips. 

The Tracker is very versatile in the sense that it drives like a sedan, but has the storage capacity and off-roading abilities of a Sport Utility Vehicle. The ZR2 model comes with 4 wheel drive as well as a roof rack, convenient for those who enjoy outdoor activities, such as kayaking, skiing, or camping. There is also a plethora of after market options to choose from such as a bike rack, grill guard, and a towing package. 

This small SUV is very drivable as well. Like I said before, it drives like a sedan, but it does have 4 wheel drive and the ability to tow up to 1500 pounds. It has a very tight turning radius and is also easy to handle on and off road. 

1 year update:
I've had the ZR2 Tracker for a year now, and it has spent 8 of the first 365 days in the shop.  First, I noticed a small oil leak at about $6,000.  I took it into the dealer for an oil change and told them to take a look.  They told me that it was leaking out of the front timing belt cover and it needed to be re-sealed. (How you can leak oil from the timing belt cover is beyond me)  While it was in, I also told them about a squeaky brake pedal.  It would make a very annoying noise when it was humid.  They had to order a part to fix this.

Next, at 1 year and 12,000 miles, I took it to Firestone to get the oil changed, and they told me I had a small oil leak.  I took it into the dealer again, and this time they told me it was leaking from the valve cover.  They had to order another part to fix this again.

I'm glad I decided to lease and not buy....

1 1/2 year update

The Tracker has spent 21 days in the shop in a year and a half.  The most recent problem was a knocking type sound from the engine compartment.  The shop decided they needed to order 11 parts to fix it, but ended up just replacing the water pump and pully.

Apparently, the parts are hard to come by.  Even though it says "Chevrolet" all over, they call it an import.  Not sure how that works....

At this point, I am actively trying to get out of the lease on this.  Even though I get a GM family discount, I doubt I will ever get another Chevy.
