            I have a Volkswagen Jetta, and while it may be a great looking car I have had nothing but problems with it! the problems started a while back when I was on a road trip not too far from home only about 2 hours from my home and the clutch completely went out! keep in mind the car is fairly new! I had to get the clutch replaced that night but the danger that put my two daughters in while we were driving is awful while on the freeway we had to swerve across lanes to avoid traffic because my Jetta wouldn't budge! 
         Then a few weeks after that I had to get the spark plug wires replaced because of a short in one of them. The mechanic said this was most likely there from the beginning. I had my timing belt break when the car only had 35,000 miles on it! so needles to say I hate this car! maybe mine is just the exception, because I ave known a few satisfied Jetta owners but I would personally NEVER buy another! <br><br>
