            The Mazda miata may be a flashy new car at first, but think of its functionality.  This car must have a certain type of person driving it. It must be a person with no children, no need to take anything large from one place to another,not concerned with safety, or a person who also has another car.  
I own a miata (not by choice) and while it is a well made car that only has minor problems after 10 years of ownership, I want a different car. As a current college student, I have found my miata to be more in the way than anything else.  I am always having to borrow my father's car because I have a box that I need to take home or have the need to take more than one friend out for the night.  It is simply not functional.
On top of everything else, I am scared to death to ride in it.  My mother calls it a matchbox car, and rightfully so.  It looks like it could just blow away with the next large gust of wind.  I hope to get rid of it before I happen to get in a wreck in it, because I have nightmares of myself being completely crushed due to the fact that my car is nothing more than a sleek looking tin can.<br><br>
