              When I bought the Dimera 3500 off of Ebay I thought I was getting a really good deal at only $109.00 but it turns out you really get what you pay for.  

  This camera takes pictures at two resolutions 320x240 or 640x480.  I would suggest that if you use this camera then you should only use the fine setting of 640x480.  The other resolution isn't worth looking at.  At the fine resolution you get fair pictures that you can use to email your family or to run an auction on ebay.  I have used mine to sell two items on ebay.

  If you buy this camera then i would suggest that you get extra memory to take pictures on.  The 2meg chip  that you get with the camera will get about 8 to 10 pictures before you have to download it to your computer.  Another thing to get would be the AC adaptor as downloading will eat up the batteries quite fast,  and at about 7 bucks apiece the adaptor will pay for itself in no time.

  Overall the Dimera 3500 is an ok camera.  If all you want to do is send a few pictures with your email or put some items up for auction and you don't want to spend a lot of money,  then this camera is for you.  But, if you want photographic quality pictures then you need to look elsewhere.<br><br>
