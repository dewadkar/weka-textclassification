            (Note: The reviewed model is a fully loaded 2001 Malibu LS, Leather interior, moon roof, keyless entry, AM/FM/Cassette/CD, 3.1 Litre 170HP V-6 engine)

As I am a soon to be father, I am officially retiring my 2-door convertible (see my review under 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier) and headed to 4-door sedanville.  Pursuant to this necessity to find a safer, more convenient and much more reliable car, I am test driving several new and used models in the $20-$25K range.  As I am a previous Chevrolet owner, I gave the Malibu first crack to win my heart:

<b>The Good</b>
This is a solidly built car.  I heard very little road noise and the ride was smooth.  The front and back are very roomy with lots of leg room, plenty for four passengers, five would be a little crowded.  The front leather seats were comfortable and easily adjustable.  The stereo system, while only four speakers (most cars in this class sport six or eight speaker systems) was pleasantly surprising with good mid range sound and a window-shaking bass response.  The handling and breaking were adequate as was the general visibility on all sides.  Impressive items of lesser import included smooth power locks, windows, moon-roof and mirrors and the brightest, most illuminating high beams I've ever seen in a car.

The trunk space was surprisingly large, and the rear 60/40 fold down seat is a nice touch.  

The Malibu LS includes all the safety features you'd expect in a family sedan, including child-proof rear door locks, LATCH system for child restraint, dual front air bags and ABS brakes.

For those with an eye for curb appeal, the Malibu is fairly unremarkable looking.  It has a little more of a European style than the rounded Americanish lines of a Taurus or Mazda 626, which suits me but my not be preferable to everyone.  The rear spoiler adds a little spunk, but overall, it remains average in appearance.

<b>The Bad</b>
&quot;Are you <i>SURE</i> this is a V-6?&quot; Yes, I actually asked this question.  Whether its the engineering, curb weight or the fact that the air is very humid in Houston, Texas, the Malibu is surprisingly gutless.  I didn't expect the performance of a Corvette, but all 170 of those horses need to go on a diet or at least a daily trot around the track.  The shifting wasn't as smooth as I would expect in a high end model, especially at a high acceleration rate.

The climate controls are what I would consider primitive.  Only the standard heating/cooling/AC/defrost settings are available, there is no specific temperature control.

<b>The Ugly</b>
At almost $24,000, this car simply does not measure up at all to its competitors.  Such models as the Honda Accord EX V-6 and the Mitsubishi Galant GTZ to name two, ring in at about the same price and offer higher performance, side impact air bags, more robust climate controls and more advanced sound systems sporting 6-8 speakers and 6 CD in dash changers.  Not to mention that both are rated higher for driver and passenger safety and both are much stronger performers in terms of retaining their value over time.  

<b>The Summary</b>
I like this car.  Unfortunately, this is the strongest statement I can make, and in this price range, I wont settle for something I can't fall in love with.  Driving the Malibu is like eating Vanilla Ice Cream.  Its safe, you know what you're getting, and its the same every time - nice, but boring.  I still have several test drives to do, but at this time, I'd certainly steer a potential buyer in another direction.
