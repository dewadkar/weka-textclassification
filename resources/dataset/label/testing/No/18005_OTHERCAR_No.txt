            We purchased a 1993 Saturn SL2 from a Saturn dealer.  We had been feeling very good about this purchase as we researched the safety tests and consumer reports and hadn't found anything pertaining to this vehicle.  We purchased it for it to be our family car.  This car had all the amenities for the long road trips our family takes.  It was comfortable to ride in.  And the engine wasn't ever supposed to break down.  

Our fist problem came when we noticed an oil leak and brought this to the attention of the tech working on our car for regularly scheduled maintanence.  After looking at it, he said he couldn't find a leak and to not worry.  This being a relatively new car, I took his advice.  WRONG thing to do.  The oil leak just became a greater and greater problem for the car.  Each time we took it to Saturn to fix we left with about $500 less than we started with.  We also had issues of parts going out in the Saturn that would die right after the warranty ended.  This happened to us twice with the same part!!  The final straw was when a dealership that is part of the Saturn Family in our area evaluated our car for trade and said he couldn't give it more than $1250.  Our Saturn had not had a wreck, or any body damage.  We took good care of this car, but no one can maintain a lemon indefinitely.  From this point on, the Saturn Company has not been willing to speak with us regarding our experiences.  We sold our Saturn at auction and will never by another Saturn ever again.  <br><br>
