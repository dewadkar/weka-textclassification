            Not bad looking. A little on the conservative side, but handsome. Actually, I got quite a few looks in it, including one on a highway of a guy who was already in a plum '00 Impala (not as nice as mine though!), who sped up to check mine out. The tan leather interior was nice, and pleasing to the touch. The seats were very nice and supportive, and all the materials felt high-quality. The 4-speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly, and reacted well to a hard stab of the gas. The brakes as well, worked superbly, stopping quickly and assuredly. It was quiet at highway speeds, a quiet conversation between one person up front and one in the back seat is possible.
I found the car quite spacious on the inside. All the glass creates an airy feeling in the car as well.
The engine was stout, responsive, and smooth. Some people may complain that it's &quot;dated&quot;, but I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The 3.8-liter V6 more than holds its own with the biggest V6s Honda and Toyota offer. <br><br>
