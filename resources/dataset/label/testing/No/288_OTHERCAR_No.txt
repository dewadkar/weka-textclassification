            I would agree with most of the reviews for this camera, the good things that have been said. I have only a few things to add.

I bought this camera in October/November 2001 (yeah, I know, the review is a little late ;-) ). After having used this camera extensively (I am an amateur photographer), I have a few complaints about this otherwise excellent camera.

<p><b>BAD MECHANICAL DESIGN</b>

<p>After seeing some good usage, the <b>clamshell door</b> on this camera has become <b>loose</b> (has been loose for the past 6 months). Since this door also acts as the on/off switch for the camera, the merest nudge to it while taking pictures (the right hand that has to press the shutter release button rubs against this door) switches off the camera.

<p>By the time you realize what has happened and open the door again, you've probably missed your shot. This gets very  irritating very quickly. No matter how careful you are, you <b>will inadvertently switch off the camera at least 1 in 10 times</b>. I have <b>missed so many shots</b> because of this.

<p>What I am saying is that this clamshell design, which looks so good and seems such a neat solution, is actually an <b>inherently very bad mechanical design</b>. <b>Any design that uses a movable door/switch</b> which can be inadvertently pushed by your right hand <b>is bad design</b>, irrespective of the model or manufacturer.

<p><b>LONG STARTUP TIME & SHUTTER DELAY</b>

<p>From the moment you pull back the clamshell door to the time the camera is ready to take pictures, <b>takes about 3-5 seconds to startup</b>. That is too long and often causes you to miss shots.

<p>The second issue is the <b>long shutter delay</b>. This refers to the delay between the pressing of the shutter release button and the actual capturing of the picture. In strong daylight, this is down to about 1 second, but in the dark this time can easily go up to 2-3 seconds. Once again, this means missed moments (especially with action and people pictures).

<p><b>LONG WRITE TIMES</b>

<p>This camera takes a long time to write image files to SmartMedia cards (the storage cards used), making for undesirably long pauses between successive pictures (about 3-5 seconds), unless you're in the multiple images mode (this is a good and useful mode for capturing action shots in adequate lighting).

<p><b>EXPLANATION OF THE CONS</b>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I love my Olympus Camedia D-510. All the complaints above stem from the fact that this camera is a relatively early design. It has little to do with the ability of Olympus to make good cameras (with the exception of the good-looking but ultimately stupid clamshell door design).
