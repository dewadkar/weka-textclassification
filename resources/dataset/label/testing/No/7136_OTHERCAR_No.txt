            I would first like to point out that I do not own a 1998 s-10, but my father purchased one new in 98' and I have driven extensively and therefore consider myself qualified to give an opinion.
This base model s-10 with 2.2 litre was purchased new in 1998 by my father. Due to the line of work we are in, i am usually the one who drives it and so forth. Although it is a nice little truck considering the less than $11,000 price tag, I feel it is by no means a great truck for the following reasons...

1. It has been back to the dealer no less than 5 times for defects and a recall. (leaking coolant line, winshield adhesive problems twice, winshield delamination, leaking shock absorber)

although i will admit that these are not serious problems, I am somewhat worried that these all occured in the first year and a half of ownership!
this truck has less than 15,000 miles on it... Were the quality control guys on vacation the day this was built???

2. The truck has a meager and grossly underpowered 2.2 litre powerplant in it which has barely enough strength to propel it down the road and not near enough to tow anything of consequence, yet still cannot manage better than low 20's for fuel economy.(equiped with a 5 spd. gearbox)

Note: My 91' s-10 is a piece of junk with 125,000 mi. on it and will run almost as fast and will tow twice as much as this 98'...go figure.

3. Lord help you if you ever have to work on the 2.2 litre (which I think is built by Isuzu) The room under the hood is non existant, and this engine is cluttered with boxes and modules etc., which would look right at home aboard the space shuttle. Nothing on the engine is where or what it should be. The ignition system utilizes some kind of distributorless stator internally linked to each cylinder individually. (each cylinder has its own stator inside the block)...For some reason, instead of running a hose from the cooling system to the heater core, GM has thoughtfully installed a &quot;stamped STEEL pipe type thing&quot; that is simply pressed into the ALUMINUM head (bad metalurgical things happen when steel and aluminum connected)and runs to the rear of the motor where it then links up with a hose running to the heater core. This in its self is a future problem waiting to happen. It has already been back to the dealer because the connection was leaking...

4. The 98' which bills itself as being bigger than previous models, has less cab room than my 91'. I am a relatively big guy and I find this truck to be quite cramped.

The truck handles well and rides decent for a small truck, but its long list of shortcommings would definitely prevent me from buying one!
Although, I have been raised a Ford hater, I have test drove a new ranger and must admit for about the same price, I like it far more than the s-10
and quite frankly prefer my ragged out 91' over the newer 98'(and I hate my 91')<br><br>
