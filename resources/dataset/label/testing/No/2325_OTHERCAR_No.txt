            I am loving this camera!  We had thought long and hard and did a lot of research (including reading TONS of epinions) before buying a digital camera.  After spending almost an hour at Best Buy (most of that time was just waiting to be helped), we got the Toshiba PDR-M4.  

This camera has a lot going for it.  It has a resolution of 1600 x 1200, although you can take a picture at several different levels of resolution.  Even at the lowest resolution, the picture comes out extremely clear.

It has a rechargeable battery.  That was an important feature for us.  We had discovered that with digital cameras, the flash eats a battery right up.  Rather than spend a mint buying new batteries, we can recharge this one (although we are going to buy a spare battery, to use while this one is recharging).  

It is very light and compact.  It only weighs 8 1/2 oz without the battery.  You can easily carry this with you anywhere without it being a burden.

It comes with a 8MB SmartMedia Memory card.  This card is capable of holding over 100 pictures taken at a low resolution.  You can also hook it directly to your computer with the included cables and download your pics.

A downfall of course to any digital camera is the lack of an actual paper photograph.  That can easily be solved if you have a decent color printer and some photo paper.  However, with the purchase of this camera, we are able to get something like 50 free prints through e-mail.  I forget all the details, but that is a good deal considering I don't think I take that many pictures in a year.

Another downfall to this camera is due to the size.  The serial cable is a little difficult to remove from the camera if you have big fingers.  My husband can't hardly do it, I usually come help him.

So, overall, I highly recommend this camera.  Is is far cheaper than other cameras with these capabilities.  Like I said, I may never use a film camera again.

-------------------------------------

UPDATE!  After only 14 months, the mode dial popped off in my hand.  After reading letters to Toshiba at PlanetFeedback, I can see this is fairly common.  I also wrote to Toshiba via PlanetFeedback and am waiting for a response.  I would like to be able to tell you that Toshiba stands behind their products.  I guess we will have to wait and see.

-------------------------------------

UPDATE!  Toshiba has done nothing about my broken camera.  I have come to the conclusion that Toshiba does not stand behind their work.  I have now gotten several letter saying that they have experienced the same problem with the mode dial. If this is such a common problem, why has nothing been done to fix it?  This camera needs to be recalled and broken cameras need to be fixed.  When I bought this camera a couple years ago, it cost more than my current PC and there is no reason for it to break after only one year.  I do NOT recommend buying this camera.
