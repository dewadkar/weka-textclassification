 The first car I got when I got my license was a 91 2WD 2door blazer. I wanted this car very bad. I had to be the happiest person when my parents gave it me as an unexpected gift! But it was not at all like I had expected. I was always having problems with this car. Two time I had to replace what I think was called the water pump. I had this car for about a year and was in and out of the auto shop. It got to where I knew everyones named that worked there! I had to replace the tires three times. And the brakes 2 times. Also when I would try to stop during the rain my brakes would lock and I would slide. It was very dangerous at stop lights. It got wrecked 3 times from the breaks locking. A friend of mine also has one and she complains of the same thing.
 One good thing about it is that it is very roomy. The stero and speakers were great! And I loved the cruise control. My car now doesn't have that and I really miss it on long drives! But I will never buy another blazer if they were the last cars on earth. I don't reccomend this car to anyone.<br><br>
