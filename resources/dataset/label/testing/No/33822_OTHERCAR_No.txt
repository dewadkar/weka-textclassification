                 I had decided that I wanted a digital camera for Christmas 1999.  When Christmas arrived I received the Canon Powershot A-50.  Even though it wasn't my first choice it still seemed like a good camera.  I found out later that it was one of the few left at the stores.  Here's why.  The Canon Powershot A-50 uses a non rechargeable lithium battery.  One of these batteries costs between $13 and $16 in the U.S.  These batteries have a disclaimer on them that they die quickly in cold temperatures. How quickly you ask. The disclaimer states that in cold temperatures you may only get to take one picture.  This might not bother some people.  But if you want pictures of the kids having a snowball fight you better stock up on batteries.  Even in warm weather the battery doesn't last very long.  In addition to the battery not lasting very long they are difficult to find since they are camera batteries only camera stores and stores with large camera departments will have them.  This camera was purchased from Staples and they did not have the batteries for this camera.  
      Another disadvantage of the camera was that it did not come with a power supply or recharger pack.  While they are available, they will cost you an extra $90 US.  In the list of items though it states that in some areas the power supply/recharger pack comes with the camera.  Apparently I just live in an unfortunate area.  In addition to costing extra, the power supply for this camera goes into the battery slot instead of having a plug.  So you have to jam the power supply in the battery case, leaving the door to the battery case open because the cord is in the way.
       Getting away from the power problems of this model camera I also thought that the position of the LCD screen was poor.  Using the LCD screen appeared to suck down the power fast so for the most part you would be using the lens viewer.  The problem with this is the LCD screen is under it and to the left.  I use my right eye when taking pictures so my nose kept touching the LCD screen.  So in turn I had to keep cleaning it.  My only other complaints are that it only came with a nine pin serial cable no USB, and that the video out didn't work in real time viewing.<br><br>
