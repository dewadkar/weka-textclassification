            I realize that every car model has its share of lemons, and it has its share of quality products.  This said, I have nothing good to say regarding the 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix's.  

Picture it!  Winnipeg, 1992.  A younger me and my mother both go to one of the local Pontiac dealerships.  Both of us had admired the stunning good looks of the Pontiac Grand Prix.  We both bought one.  She purchased a 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP with the aggressive (some what over done) styling &amp; 3.4L engine, and I purchased the entry level Pontiac Grand Prix LE 4 door.  (Hey!  I was just starting out!  I didn't have a lot of money to throw around.)  

We both chose the Grand Prix for similar reasons.  Up until recently, my parents and I had always owned GM vehicles.  It was just the way it was.  We also admired the aggresive styling, and loads of features that GM had packaged with this car.  Automatic headlights, air conditioning, tilt, cruise control, am/fm/cassette, power door locks, power windows were included in my car.  The GTP added bucket seats, the 3.4L engine, alloy wheels, ABS, and wider tires.  Both were extremely sharp looking vehicles.

Now, the problems.  My mom's vehicle had engine problems while under waranty.  Infact things were so bad they had pulled the engine, and replaced it twice.  This was motivation enough for her to sell the car.  For myself, who was silly enough to keep mine, I had to replace the instrument cluster twice.  Once was under waranty, and once was a $600 expense out of my own pocket.  Basically the cluster lit up the &quot;idiot light&quot; for the high engine temperature, while the gauge read normal.  Apparantly this problem was quite common on Grand Prix's for this model year.  As well, the rear brake design was exceptionally poor according to my mechanic.  As the car drove, moisture, and snow, or whatever is pushed off the tires directly into contact with the brake calipers.  The calipers  and brake pads deteriorate, and ultimately fail.  This was a $1300 tab!  Also not uncommon to this model year (but luckily didn't happen to me) is the failure of the Electronic Control Module, and the fuel injectors.  I have also read that electrical problems were not uncommon to this model year.  My turn signal stalk actually partially melted and smoked.  Every time I took a left turn I got a small puff of smoke off the steering column.  I took it to my mechanic and I couldn't reproduce the problem.  Then one day while driving to work I saw sparks, and a lot of smoke.  My turn signal stalk had started melting.  GM Quality!  I also had the problem where the car was constantly sputtering, and stalling out.  When the car was hooked up to the scope it didn't report a problem.  I tried to  show my mechanic, and the dealership the problem, and they were baffled.  Apparantly one of the engine gaskets for the intake manifold had failed.  With labour it cost me in excess of $900 to repair.  

The interior fit and finish was poor.  The power lock buttons sat in a chunk of really cheap plastic.  The buttons if pressed hard enough would snap.  I had to replace the power window button on the passenger side, and because GM's part department didn't think of the eventuality of replacing just the button, I had to buy the whole assembly. (Switch assembly).  Also, the carpet that was by the driver's side foot well along the drivers side door always came loose from the moulding, and was always being fixed under waranty.  Finally, just before the car came off waranty, I had them secure the piece with velcro, which seemed to be more durable.

I really couldn't complain about the starter, and the car's ability to start in cold weather.  Winnipeg has never been known for mild winters, and that car started flawlessly, even when I forgot to plug in the block heater.  The original Delco battery that came equipped with the car cracked in half the first winter.  But once replaced I never had a problem starting that car.  And paint quality was top notch on the exterior.

Comfort within the vehicle was excellent.  Headroom, and hip room were both abundant.  You could seat 5 adults comfortably in my sedan, and 6 in a pinch.  The addition of a little peg in the back gave the perfect place to run a seatbelt for a baby seat.  The dumbest feature was the glovebox with the 3 digit combonation style lock.

All in all the car left a sour taste in my mouth towards GM vehicles.  Once I sold the car I replaced it with a Ford F-150 (which I love due to its trouble free nature).  If you are in the market for a mid sized sedan,
 steer away from the 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix's!  They are nothing but trouble!<br><br>
