                This is the second ML that my parents have bought, the first being a 98 ML 320. According to the dealer, there were over 1000 improvements to the car/truck. Some are clearly visible, as generally finish has improved with minor details such as rear seat arm rest and rear airbags, however fit has not, as the "can" (car + van) as my sister calls it, basically falls apart after a few miles. We haven't driven it 12,000 miles yet and the two front windows don't work, the cupholders fall out of their holders, and the engine always had something wrong with it since the day we bought the car. My mother, who liked the last ML we owned, hates this one. 
    As for driving, the ML handles well, although the steering is very, very light, even more so then my BMW 750, which also has very light steering, and according to my mother, this is a bad thing. When driving the car, the suspension is very stiff, and the car exhibits noticeably more body roll then its predecessor. As a result, the car has a less soft ride than its predecessor. 
    The transmission is the Manui-matic type, and for some reason has a tendency to not upshift at appropriate revs, and either does to too quickly or too slowly. I don�t know why the engine doesn�t have a red line, it makes "sport" driving much harder, as I cant tell when is the best time to up shift as well, though I doubt most buy this car for that kind of driving. Also important is that the car "feels" unstable at moderately high speeds making me hesitant to go faster than 75.
    All in all, the car would be great if it was more reliable.
    As for features, the car has lots of gadgets to tinker with, though the "user-friendly-ness" is worse that the last car's. The sound system is better, as it�s by Bose. 
    I would give the car less stars, but it is not all bad, as a result I think it is about average at best. Personally, I would buy something else for the price.
