            I bought this car new in Aug 2000. It has served me well. I live in Alaska, where we can get LOTS of snow in a short period of time. My Kia has ALWAYS made it through the snow, with a very easy shift into 4WD. The front seals have needed to be replaced two times (under warranty), and now at 20,000 miles, the check engine light has come on 3 times in the last 2 months. The first time, it was because 2 of the 4 spark plugs had gone bad due to water in there (towing was free, and this was covered under warranty). This happened from the car wash undercarriage spray. The second time, it was on for a week, then it went off. Took it to the dealership, and it turned out it needed a new catalyic convertor. Replaced for free under warrnaty. Have also had engine light come on, taken to dealership, and it was due to a leaky gas cap (poor vacuum seal). Replaced under warranty. 
 I must say that the service department at the dealership is OUTSTANDING! They always get me in and out as quickly as possible. My biggest complaint (if you live in a cold climate) is that the rear door will freeze shut in the winter, and you will have a hard time getting it open if you need to. The rear spare tire also really rattles when driving over bumpy roads. It has a lot of get up and go for a little 4 cylinder, and gas mileage isn't too bad (average 20 mpg). I have taken my Kia over all kinds of terrain, and it has never had a problem. 
Great fro around town, and getting through bad weather, but seats do get a bit uncomfortable after 4 or more hours in the car. Lots of headroom, and legroom. Can pack a lot into one of these little babies.
