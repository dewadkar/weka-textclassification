            The 1996 Plymouth Neon is by far one of the worst cars I have ever seen or driven.  Luckily I don't own one, but unfortunately my girlfriend does.  Before I get into the specs of the neon let me tell you a little story of what you should expect performance wise from a neon.  My girlfriend and I got into a little fight and I decided to blow her off and go out with a few friends.  Being the determined woman that she is she tracked me down and tried to get me to pull over.  I decided that I would just lose her until I cooled off and than I would call and apologize.  I floored my 2000 Mustang and took off, she floored her Neon and tried desperately to keep up.  To make a long story short, she never caught me and the next day her "check engine" light was on (my car was fine).  When she took her car in to get it looked at they said that it would take hours just to look at the engine simply because it was designed so small they had to lift it out of the body to get a good look.  Her little race with my mustang eventually cost her close to $600.  This is what you should expect from a Neon, but if your not convinced that you should NOT by one, keep reading.
The Plymouth Neon is powered by a tiny 2.0 liter four cylinder engine that has to be almost floored just to keep up with 65 mph traffic.  The interior isn't horrible but there is not much right with it either.  The dash is very long making it almost impossible to get anything that has slid to the back while driving, the long dash also takes away from the interior space.  The back seats allow for leg room but aren't that comfortable (my back was aching after 45 minutes in the back).  The only thing that the Neon has going for it is the good crash tests, they aren't great, but their good.
This car also has frequent problems and is in the shop more than out.  The car is overall not that expensive to fix, unless it is an engine problem, in which case expect to pay hundreds due to the amount of time needed to fix.
It is not that expensive but you get what you pay for, not much.  I would defiantly STAY AWAY from this car!!!
