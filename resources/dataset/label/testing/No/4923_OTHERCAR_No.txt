            After being a Chevy man for many years and in need of a good reliable truck, I decided to buy a used Dodge pickup.  I had seen so many on the road and they looked great and had heard no real problems about them.  I even checked Epinions before finally making my decision to go with the Ram.

After purchasing a used 1999 Ram with 60,000 miles, I noticed the transmission slipped a bit.  My dealer had another unit on the lot with 50,000 miles that was the same except it had a towing package, and they were willing to take the one I purchased back and give me the other one.

This pickup has been basically a good truck, but not totally problem free.  Upon start up, when I pull out slowly and stop, not allowing the auto transmission to shift between first and second, it will get stuck between gears.  I have to put the truck in park, then in gear again in order to proceed.  This only occurs on start up and only once in a while.  But why it's happening, no one knows.

The truck looks good and runs great.  Plenty of power and hauling capacity, but I've started hearing a lot of stories about transmission problems with the Ram pickup.  I've also seen in the news lately about problems with the steering. Dodge makes a great looking truck and needs to make sure they don't hurt themselves by allowing problems such as transmissions hurt their reputation. 

If you're looking for a gas saver, this isn't the vehicle to purchase.  In Dodge's defense, it is a truck.  City mileage is about 13 to 14 miles per gallon.  I went from a Toyota Tacoma to the Dodge, a big change.  I needed more truck but wasn't expecting that low of mileage.  My fault and not something I hold against Dodge.  Just want others to be aware.

The only other small compliant I have about the Dodge 1500 is the noise in the cab.  It has a good bit of plastic rattle noise from the cup holder.  Not a major problem, but a bit annoying.

Before recommending a Dodge pickup to anyone, I would suggest you try to find out for sure about the "suspected" transmission problems.  I'm hoping mine will hold out long enough to make it worth the purchase price.  My only other Dodge was a 1991 Spirit which my wife literally ran the tires off and fought me tooth and nail when I finally convinced her to trade it in.  It was a great car, but I'm wondering if Dodge is living up to its reputation of building a reliable vehicle, as it was always known for.

<b>Update to transmission problem. 1/20/2004</b>

Wanted to post this update since checking transmission fluid levels on a Dodge pickup must be done a specific way in order to get a correct reading on the transmission dip stick.  I knew one needed to start the engine to check the fluid level.  What I didn't know was, in a Dodge pickup, you also have to put the truck in neutral, then check the fluid level in the transmission with the engine running.  

It seems that the level will give a false (Full) reading if not done this way.  When the problem mentioned above first started, the first thing I did was check the transmission fluid level, by only starting the engine.  It showed the level as full.  After being informed of this procedure, the level showed correctly, low.  Even with no visible leaks under the truck, for some reason, the transmission was 1 and 1/2 quarts low!  Filled today and will monitor to see if problem has been solved.  Will provide update at a later date.  This may change my opinion about the Dodge 1500 pickup.  My problems may have all be related to a dealer prep that didn't fill the transmission properly.
