            When I graduated high school, so did my car and I upgraded to this great little Nissan.  I fell in love with it on sight and haven't stopped since.

My jet black '91 Nissan 240 SX was a greatly reliable vehicle that reflected my style and personality as well as it served the purpose of transporting me all over the state.  

Let me elaborate on the positive:
If properly cared for, the car has a great four cylinder engine that hums like a dream, ample trunk space, an interior where everything is literally at your fingertips, and adjustable comfort levels for the the driver and front seat passenger.  It has average features, such as a cassette player, locking glove box, tilt steering, overdrive, rear defog., side door storage areas, easy-access trunk and gas releases, and a middle console box for more knick-knacks.  I averaged about 300 miles to a full tank of gas and didn't have to put much out for it but best of all, this car doesn't drive like a tin can on wheels. For a 4-cylinder vehicle, it has good push, OK pick up, and great speed once you're going. It's a great car for those who have the interest to do up with tinted windows, rims, and chrome tips.

Unfortunately:
The worst problem I had with the car is the fact that it is very light in the back end making rainy or snowy weather conditions virtually impossible or at the very least, challenging to drive in.  With good tires and responsible driving skills, torrential rain can be dealt with.  However, in snow and ice, even with good tires and a hundred pound bag of salt in the trunk for leverage, it's slow going.  

Minor complaints include the flack I would catch from friends in the backseat.  I am pretty tall at 5'10" and required the driver's seat to be pretty far back which did not leave much floor room for feet behind me.  And although I did not require many repairs, the few I had to get done would be a little costly because the parts were foreign.

It was my favorite car and if given the chance, I would have liked to have gotten the '95 model but my '98 Acura is helping me get over the idea (wink).
