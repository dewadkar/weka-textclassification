              I bought this truck after hearing all the horror stories about it's American competition. Well after driving my American made (California) Tacoma for just under a 1,000 all of my anti-domestic car fervor started to fade.
  First my rear bumper showed two fissures in the chrome that immediately started to rust during the winter season. Then I noticed that the truck had no alignment at all, pulling severely to the left when you let go of the wheel. Looking at the front bumper one day while I was washing it I noticed that the front bumper was mounted noticeably higher on one side than the other. Another nice touch was the right washer sprayer ceasing to spray, and the left one shooting over the truck.
  When I took it back to the dealer they fixed the front bumper( now with 18,000. miles on it the bumper is loose on that side) did a terrible alignment, fixed the washers, and told me &quot;rusting on chrome is normal, just use some steel wool to get it off&quot;.
  The last time I took it to the dealer was to have them tell me what the loud ticking sound was in the engine, (they claimed normal injector noise) and why my front brakes don't release at the same time as my rear brakes (sorry we couldn't duplicate the problem).
  As this truck approaches 19,000 miles the rear bumper has a piece of chrome the size of a silver dollar that has rusted away and formed an actual pocket against the steel underneath, my brakes lock up a split second before coming to a stop and at a sudden take off. <br><br>
