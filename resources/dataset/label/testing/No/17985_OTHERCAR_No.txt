            This was the first type of digital camera we had.  We bought it based on price...  It was under $200 and it worked for getting us started in the world of digital photography.

It takes the pictures and holds almost 100 pictures in it.  But the pictures are of low quality (unless you want just a wallet size picture).  

It eats batteries like there is no tomorrow, you must have high quality batteries, or lithium type batteries if you want to take more than 10 pictures.

The view window is nice to be able to see the picture on the screen right away &amp; be able to review the pictures you have taken.

But without a flash or a zoom feature the camera isn't all that useful in a variety of situations.<br><br>
