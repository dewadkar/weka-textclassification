            I received the Kodak DC-25 as a gift from a Kodak rep I know who had moved on to megapixel power-cameras.  At the time, I was ready to shell out hundreds for a mid-range digital camera, and I must say I am glad I held off.

The DC-25 is a first-generation (read: &quot;clunky&quot;) .18 megapixel camera.  If you find one of these second-hand, be aware that this is not a camera suitable for print.  I have found this camera handy for several small tasks:

1)  Original sources for manipulation in Photoshop.  As a web designer, it's nice to be able to get really cheap pictures and tweak them out to get what you need.  Mmm, royalty-free.

2)  eBay.  Even the DC-25's small, grainy shots do help move used items.  

Basically, the bottom line here is that the photos produced by this camera are low-resolution, have odd colour issues, and are pretty grainy.  However, if your only use for a digital camera is to get quick shots for screen-only use or are willing to do a bit of touch-up work, this camera is a deal.

The LCD looks good but sucks up a lot of battery life.  You'll be replacing the battery at a cost of about $20 CDN every few months, dependant on the level of LCD use.  The camera has simple controls; fill, high-vs-low-res (yikes, low res is terrible on this camera) and a few others.  The flash card is great for laptop users, as you can plug it directly into your PCMCIA slot, and it reads it as a drive.  Also, the flash card is a Kodak standard and it can use even the newer 64MB cards if you outgrow the smaller card included with the camera.

Secondly, I might suggest a really low-range, used camera as a tester for people considering trying out a $400 camera.  Try out the process of hooking up the camera and transferring photos, and consider how much you use it.  I'm sort of a photo junkie and a designer, and I still don't use this camera all that much.  Yet, I was getting ready to blow a large amount of dough on a new megapixel camera.  Get an old one, play with it and then decide if you need a digital camera, or if it's just technolust.
