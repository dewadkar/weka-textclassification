            This is my mom's car, whcih we got from my grandfather.  It is a piece of junk that's alays giving us trouble, but we can't afford a new car right now.

Once, on my way to high school (when my mommy still drove me) it just stopped... dead at a stop sign.  It had to be towed and we laterf ound out that the battery connector fell off.

And it has had too many recalls to mention.  Attention parents, if you want to get your teen a used car for college, don't get him or her this one!  They will never forgive you for it!  I know I wouldn't if I had been given this one and not my dad's Cutlass.

PROS: Let's give credit where it's due.  It has really cool digital readouts for the speedometer (in english or metric), and you can get the fuel gauge to be digital as well.  The seats aren't that comfortable, but they fold backward so you are just about laying down.  The overall shape is stylish, and modern.  It really looks sharp.  The handling is substantial.  Steering is bad, but if you pull the seat up all the way and scrunch, it's really fun to drive on the sidestreets, weaving and steering about.  It feels like driving a go-kart.

CONS: No gauges.  Digital is cool, no doubt.  But the warning lights come on AFTER you have a problem.  So if you see the temparature light come on, you have already overheated.  And if you think you can turn it off qucikly and do anything about it, you're too late.  It is very unreliable.  The radio is such a shape that you can't install a new one.  Ever.  And it has bad sound quality, too.  So forget pimping it out with subwoofers and all sorts of techie stuff.
