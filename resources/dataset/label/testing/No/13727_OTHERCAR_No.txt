            I purchased my 2003 Murano SL AWD in Tampa, FL at Ferman Nissan.  I did not get a good deal.  The vehicle had 713 miles on it when I took it home.  It also had a large scratch on the steering wheel which has not been fixed (2 months later) although they promised it would.

The stated mileage for this vehicle is 20 mpg city and 24 mpg highway.  This was one of the main reasons I purchased this vehicle - it has the highest mileage stated for an SUV.  However, this is not the case.  <b>In actual real driving conditions the mileage is 12 mpg city and 18 mpg highway.</b>  This is a major complaint on all the discussion boards located on the internet - check for yourself.

245 Horsepower may sound like a lot, but when you are pulling around 2  tons of steel it's about as fast as a Civic.  The transmission is a CVT (continuously variable transmission), like a go-cart or snowmobile.  Just touch the accelerator and the engine rpm increases - no matter what.  Apparently it improves the mileage by 12% but it is VERY ANNOYING.  It could use some much better programming as far as how it reacts to user inputs.  It should maintain the same gear ratio unless the throttle input increases by more than 20% or so.  I have actually driven down the highway and had the tach dancing between 2000 and 6000 rpm with absolutely no change in speed.  Letting off the accelerator after aggressive acceleration actually accelerates you more as the transmission dumps off inertia from the higher rpm to lower rpm.  Under moderate to hard acceleration it tends to vibrate as though it were slipping (which it is since it is a belt between two metal discs).

The AWD isn't really what you'd expect.  There is an "AWD Lock" switch in the center console, but that is only effective to 19 mph.  Above 19 mph the vehicle is in FWD mode.  At any time (AWD Lock on or off) it detects wheel slip it will use up to a 50/50 ratio of AWD.  Personally, I want to press the "AWD Lock" button and have it stay AWD until I say so.  That is the what you are lead to believe, until you sit down with the inch-thick owners manual and find out for yourself.

I can only speak for the stiffer-riding SL Model, but I'd guess the quality is similar on the SE.  It rides fairly harsh.  Even with the large tires and soft seats.  The main result of this is RATTLES EVERYWHERE.  I get a new rattle every week.  Seriously.

Another clue to the poor workmanship is this vehicle in the rain - no, not the handling, it's great; it is very stable and has yet to lose traction even under hard acceleration and cornering.  It is the sound inside from the rain hitting the roof - it is like being in a barn with a tin roof - it is that LOUD and ANNOYING.

UPDATE
I neglected to add these details in my original posting:

The automatic climate control system is an utter failure.  When the car is cool in the morning, fresh out of the garage, the temperature must be reduced below 70 degrees to cool the car down.  I've just walked out of a 78 degree house and into an uncomfortably warm car, so I know it's off by about 10 degrees.  When the sun is out and it's hot, keeping it under 80 degrees will have it blowing full blast for at least 15 minutes.  After it settles down, then you have to keep setting the temperature control progressively cooler to maintain a comfortable, stable temperature inside the vehicle.  There is not a temperature I can leave it on to "set and forget" - it must be constantly changed based upon the outside temperature.  It's not so automatic after all.  Note:  I had an automatic climate control system in my Acura, and although it was not perfect, I could leave it at a single temperature and it would remain comfortable and stable inside the vehicle.

<b>Now for the problems:</b>

I had to immediately return the vehicle to the dealership (within 12 hours of purchase) to have the alignment corrected due to it pulling fairly aggressively to the right on the highway.  There was also a vibration in the steering wheel.  The alignment was corrected somewhat but the vibration was not.  Another trip to the dealership confirmed the pull to the right still existed, although it was "in spec".  They found that 3 of the 4 wheels were out of balance.  Hey, this was a NEW vehicle, right? 

At 2400 miles (6 weeks of ownership) the alternator went out.  Not a big deal except this is a brand new vehicle that cost about $35000 - with a special heavy-duty alternator.  The parts weren't available and I was quoted 30 days until they arrived.  I was issued a new Altima as a loaner (really bad vibration in the steering wheel - stay away from these too) and was happy because I could Lemon Law it after 30 days in the shop.  Unfortunately, it was only in the shop for 8 days, and I got back my unreliable, gas-guzzling Murano.

When I got it back i noticed a vibration when braking - a sign of warped rotors.  Now I am an excellent driver and a mechanic as a hobby (30 years worth) and always maintain and repair my own vehicles.  I understand the relationship between driving habits and wear-and-tear on a vehicle.  I have babied this car trying to get the best possible mileage and to preserve it so I can take the smallest loss possible when I get rid of it (very soon).  These rotors should not be warped.

I am now in my ninth week of ownership and am waiting for something else to break.  I have omitted the smaller nuisances in order not to seem too critical - but believe me, there is more wrong with this vehicle than I just described.  Besides the looks there is nothing to like about this vehicle.  I've read praise from people about how fast it is, smooth-riding, etc.  I have to believe they previously owned a beat-up Hyundai, because after having owned mostly Honda and Acura products, this Nissan is a piece of garbage.  Even when it is working the way it is supposed to it is not worth the hype or price.  Get a Jeep or an Isuzu for HALF AS MUCH.  There are a slew of "bulletins" (secret recalls) on this vehicle ranging from fixes for the doors locking by themselves to the windows rolling down by themselves.  This vehicle has been out for only a short time and yet you will find countless stories to back up my experiences.  Locally my fiancee spotted a Murano with "This is a Lemon" written on the windows.  I'll get a big sticker instead of shoe polish, and point people to my website at MyMuranoSucks.com.

UPDATE
Just wanted to let everyone know my Murano is in the shop today (the 10th day in the shop in 5 months) to have a "Nissan Technician" flown specially in to try to correct the steering and vibration problem that has plagued this (and most) Murano since day one.  This is the first step in obtaining a repurchase under the Florida Lemon Law; my goal is to force Nissan to repurchase this vehicle so I can put the past 5 months of hell behind me and get on with my life.  I used to love cars, Nissan has soured that love for me.

<b>FINAL UPDATE
ON DECEMBER 17, 2003, MY 2003 NISSAN MURANO WAS FOUND TO BE A LEMON UNDER THE FLORIDA LEMON LAW AND NISSAN HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THEY ARE LEGALLY BOUND TO REPURCHASE THE VEHICLE WITHIN 30 DAYS.  THERE WERE A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS VEHICLE TO BE FOUND A LEMON BUT THE ISSUE THAT WAS FOUND TO BE JUSTIFIABLE WAS A SIMPLE ISSUE TO FIX, YET NISSAN WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DO SO.  THE FINDING WAS A COMBINATION OF SHODDY WORKMANSHIP OF THE MURANO, EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND INCOMPETENT SERVICE TECHNICIANS AT FERMAN NISSAN IN TAMPA, FLORIDA.

ALL I CAN SAY TO YOU POTENTIAL NISSAN/INFINITI OWNERS OUT THERE IS CAVEAT EMPTOR (BUYER BEWARE).  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  I LEARNED MY LESSON AND THEY HAVE LOST MY BUSINESS FOR LIFE.

ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO NISSAN IS I TOLD YOU SO -YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED.  GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE YOUR DEEDS CATCH UP TO YOU.
