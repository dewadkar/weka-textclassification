            We purchased a new 1999 GMC Suburban, in the spring of 1999.  From the beginning, 34 miles, it has been a problem.  One thing after another with the brakes.  It has been to the shop 10 times.  They have worked on them up till now.  They say they are worn normally.  I have never had heat cracks in the rotors, of any vehicle before.  This has been 32,000 miles of hell.  There is a problem with the brakes.  There are bulletins listed about them.  They seem to have repeated problems with the brakes.  They are unable to correct the brakes.  They claim the average life span of the brakes is 8,000 miles.  Have you ever heard such a thing?  I have had 3 complete sets of brakes and is ready for a forth.  I am in contact with a lawyer and discussing the lemon law.  10 times and not corrected, what is wrong here.  There is always a smell in the garage when I pull in.  The hot brakes.  
Also the air conditioner went out.  What a mess.  Now it is on it way out again.  
Most of the problem is brakes.  I hope something can be done soon.
