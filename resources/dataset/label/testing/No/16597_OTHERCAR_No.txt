            We bought the camera in February 2002 - it was wonderful right out of the box.  It took wonderful outside shots and good indoor shots; however, lighting was a factor.  We purchased a starter kit - which included a NP-FS11 battery pack, charger and case.  Also had to purchase a larger memory card - 64mb.  I've been considering purchasing another battery pack and another memory card - I took 97 photos and memory card was full, battery pack needed to be charged.  If I had another - I could have taken more photos.  I didn't make my purchase right away - glad I waited because when I turn on the camera now I get a E:92:00 error.  The camera still works on regular AA batteries - but for 15 shots its just not worth it.  I've spent quite some time trying to find info on the error - came across many others with the same problem, problems getting sony to respond to them and a quote from sony service of $139 to fix the problem.  

The camera is 8 months old - still looks nice - have taken well over 1000 photos but I would never recommend another SONY CYBERSHOT Digital camera because of the poor quality product.  

Avoid this product  - it is way too expensive.  Memory is too expensive (other types are ALWAYS on sale - Memory Sticks are not).  A good battery is a MUST with a digital camera and this one just doesn't have it together.  

Updated: 12/31/02 - I brought the camera into an authorized repair shop - to get the list they request the camera model so their list should be accurate - or so you would think.  They couldn't do a thing for me.  The owner of the shop said there are a few cameras that he can work on - this is not one of them.  The only option is to pay the $139 to send it to Sony.  It does not make me want to buy another Sony product.  The camera does work on AA or Rechargeable AA Batteries.  I will be using my Maha Powerex batteries until I get a new camera.  I am leaning towards Canon at this point.
