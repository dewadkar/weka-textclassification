            I purchased a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited about a year ago and have had nothing but trouble with it.  When I bought it, it had 119,000 miles on it and now has 143,000 miles, so it has made it a long time.  Right after I bought it, I had trouble starting in park, I would have to wiggle the shifter to get it to start.  Back up lights would seldomly come on.  After a few miles I had to replace the tires because they were wearing so bad with the all-wheel-drive.  So I replaced them and had it aligned and it still wears the outside real bad.  The brakes squeaked bad enough that I went out and bought all new rotors, performance disc brakes, and drum brakes to stop all the noise, big mistake, it still makes loud squeaks and grinds.

After about 20,000 miles of driving it, I had an axle and power steering pump go out.  Cost about $400 for all of that.  About 5,000 more miles, I had to replace a tie rod, steering sector, and two front u-joints.  Costing another $450.  Then about Christmas I was driving home from work and noticed another sound coming from the front end so I had it looked at and it turned out that the front hub bolts that the lug nuts mount to spun loose causeing the wheel to wiggle back and forth ruining the wheel, rotor, and hub.  I know that it sounds like someone didn't get the tire on tight, but they looked at it and came to the conclusion that the back of the bolts broke loose.  This totaled just under $500 not counting the wheel.  I priced one and decided just to stick with the spare for awhile.

And if that wasn't enough, the paint is now peeling off and the radio keeps going off until you beat on the top of the dash to get it to come back on.  Now just recently I had to have the second front axle replaced.  I have invested so much into this vehicle that I have no extra money to buy a different vehicle and the Jeep isn't worth enough to trade it off.
