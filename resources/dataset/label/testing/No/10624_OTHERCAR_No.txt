            I just returned from a trip to Shreveport, LA, during which my rental car was a 2000 Leganza.  The car was fairly comparably equipped to my 1993 Nissan Maxima (leather, cd stereo, power, etc).  But even though the Leganza was seven years newer and 80,000 lighter in miles, I won't be trading my Nissan in for one any time in the foreseeable future.

The car I drove had approximately 18,000 miles on it.  I know that rental car mileage is rough mileage, but I figure this is probably equivalent to 30,000 miles for the average driver.  It definitely didn't seem to be holding up well - already there was a definite vibration in the front end, especially at cruising speeds (60+).  The transmission didn't shift very smoothly either.  But the overall ride was decent.

<b>Seating.</b>  The seats in the Leganza were firm, almost to the point of being uncomfortable.  The leather was nice, but didn't seem to be quality.  I don't think they'll stand the test of time.  I didn't like that there was no way to adjust lumbar, etc. (perhaps this is an extra add-on if you get power seats or something).  I have a bad back, and after about an hour of driving this car I had to stop and stretch.  I can usually go at least two hours in my Maxima without stopping.

<b>Stereo.</b>  The sound system left <b>a lot</b> to be desired.  While I have never been a fan of window shattering, earth shaking bass, I do like a little.  This system had practically none, even with the bass all the way up and the treble all the way down.  The best word I can think of to describe the quality is &quot;tinny&quot;.  There were also preset equalizer settings, but in my opinion they only made the sound worse.  And one other interesting quirk: once when I stopped the car and put it in park, the volume control dropped down to almost nothing.  I thought this might be a nice feature - to keep you from blasting yourself out of the car - but it only did it once in the dozen or more times I put the car in park.  It's a malfunctioning feature at best, and with less than 20,000 miles on the car that's not a good sign.

<b>Acceleration.</b>  Now, I am used to the power of six and eight cylinder cars.  But I have driven some four cylinders that could give my Max a run for its money.  This is not one of those cars.  This car was absolutely gutless in my opinion - even on a downhill entrance ramp I was only doing about 55 at the base.  My brother's car, a 1984 Chevy Cavalier <i>station wagon</i>, can at least be doing 65!

I also noticed an annoying trait of the windshield wipers - when on the lowest setting, there is a click as the wiper swipes back and forth.  It was audible even when the stereo was playing at a reasonable level.  I also found the cruise control flaky...even on a road with no inclines to speak of the speed would fluctuate slightly.

While on the plane back to Tulsa, I was flipping through the in flight magazine.  In it was a DaeWoo ad, comparing the Nubira (I think) to a Corolla and a Civic.  It showed that the DaeWoo was ~$2,500 cheaper than comparably equipped cars in its class, and that is certainly true.  However, I had a Civic that lasted me 180,000 miles, and it would probably still be running if I had maintained the timing belt. (it jumped at 80 mph...not a good thing :)  Somehow I don't see a DaeWoo lasting much more than 100,000 miles.

Bottom line, you get what you pay for...and if you're looking for a reasonably priced mid-sized car I think you'd be better off getting a car with a little more of a proven track record for quality and reliability.  In short, buy a Honda.<br><br>
