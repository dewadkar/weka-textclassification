            Hi there,

     When first looking at the Mazda B3000 4X4 (1999 ext. cab) it appeared to be a very well built vehicle.  It also had more goodies and a lower price than other compact 4X4's.  Little did I know.....

     The first eight months of ownership were great - no complaints.  But then things started going wring.  So far I've owned this truck for about 14 months, and here is what I've had to deal with - - - Countless squeaks and rattles - - - allot of serious pitting rust under the door trim - - - two speed sensors have gone out - - - all windows leak when raining - - - the horn doesn't work - - - all the cute exterior emblems are comming off - - - the power steering is completely shot - - - trans. slips when in 4 wheel drive - - - both door locks have broken - - - I've replaced the battery 3 times - - - the &quot;door open&quot; lights and dome lights often stay on even when doors are shut - - - and last, assuming it's because of heat and warping, a few of the panels and various plastic parts located inside the dash board have cracked and broken.   Also - the treatment I receive at the dealerships for warr. service is terrible.  The work is also incomplete and often &quot;rigged&quot;.<br><br>
