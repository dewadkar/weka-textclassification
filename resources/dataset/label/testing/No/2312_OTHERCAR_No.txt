<TEXT>
            I bought my Kia new in 1999.  There have been several recalls, all of which have been time-consuming and, to put it mildly, nuisances.  

This is my first car, and will certainly be my last Kia.  The ride is noisy and rough. Acceleration is poor and comfort is minimal. I've had the brakes replaced three times, despite the fact that I'm a conscientious driver. Four months after buying it, the battery died.  While my car is barely two years old, it handles as though it were a five- to six-year-old car.  

I bought the Kia for its affordability, but I now realize a well-made car is worth the price.  The Kia Sephia is neither.  I've already begun looking into trading it in, but (of course) I still owe more than it's trade-in value.  I can only hope that the car lasts long enough for me to trade it in for a better car.  I am assuming it will act as a paltry down payment, but I'll be glad to be ride of it.
