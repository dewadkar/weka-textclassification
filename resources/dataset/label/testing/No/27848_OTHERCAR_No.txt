            I am at the end of my lease on a 1997 Mitsubishi Galant.  Am I happy enough to buy the car.....no.

I love the car's exterior look and love the interior even better.  
The first day I drove it off the lot almost 3 years ago it was raining.  I noticed that one headlight had moisture inside causing it fog....remember first day off the lot!!

I then had to call a tow truck 2 times over the next 2 years due to the car not starting.  Although I do believe it was a problem with the security system.  I have been told before that never get anything dealer installed.  Did I listen???  NOOOO

The alarm was dealer installed and eventually disabled it.  I also had a dealer installed sunroof.  Switch broke on the open position...yes of course it started to rain.

I also heard it before but Mitsubishi Galants are known for transmission problems.  And I started to notice the car shifting very hard just a few months off the lot (and I dont abuse the car at all).

Next, my windshield cracked from a small rock on the highway.  Mitsubishi fixed it right away at no charge.  They gave me a brand new windshield.  My friend also had the same thing happen.

Believe it or not even though this review sounds harsh....I do like the car.  But dont you agree that if you lease a brand new car you should not really have any problems?

Will I get another one.....maybe....still havnt decided the 2000's look awesome (something tells me here we go again)<br><br>
