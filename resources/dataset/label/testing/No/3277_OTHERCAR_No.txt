            I am 17, and am an aggressive, but smart driver as the result of 2 accidents.  My mom got this car after her 1994 Buick had tranny problems.  Let me start by saying this car is WAY better than the Buick, which i had to drive when i got my permit.  The looks of the the car are OK, but not really my style.  The car is much too long and heavy for a coupe.  Because of this the handling is not too great, at least not for a corner demon like myself.  I actually prefer driving my toyota corolla on backroads since the smaller car is more responsive on winding roads.  For a sporty coupe, the Solara exhibits too much body roll in corners.  Some stiffer shocks and wider 215 tires would help this.  the 16 inch tires/wheels on the V6 are good.  The 4cyl engine is pretty good for a 4 cyl, but a car this heavy really needs a 6.  For my mom however, the 4 is more than enough power, and the car is so much faster than her old Buick, which was ironically a 6 cyl.  Well thats a buick for ya. 157 HP is pretty good for a 4 cyl engine, and i enjoy testing the car on the highway late at night.  My one complaint would be that sometimes when u floor it, the car picks up immediately and RPM's go flying, other times if you dont hit it just right, the engine will take a while to hit the 6200rpm redline.  This car is quite stable at high speeds 65-105 MPH.  I have never gone over 105 in the car, but it was pretty stable at around 100MPH, and RPM's werent even that high.  The interior set up of the car is very good.  The radio and climate controls are easy to use while driving. The JBL "premium" CD sound system is quite lacking.  The speakers are rated at a low 15W power, and my aftermarket CD player and speakers in my Corolla are far superior to this "premium" system. I like the fact that there is a tach in this car, since my corolla doesnt have one.  The car is very long in the front, which makes touchy manuevers and tight parking slightly more difficult. I also like how toyota's have a reserve fuel tank and an orange light that comes on when u hit the reserve.  As for gas mileage, this car is crappy for a 4 cyl, but that is probably due to its weight.  The seats are quite comfortable, and the rear has a good bit of room for a coupe, but it is difficult for a tall person to get to the rear seats.  The seats do tend to pick up lint quite easily, but the seats are black so this is expected. Trunk is a good size. One thing i really DO NOT like about this car are the brakes.  The car is brand new, and yet they still feel weak and mushy, and i think they are inadequate for the size and weight of this car.  Also the paint seems to scratch easily, and the car is low, so be carful not to hit parking blocks w/ the front end.  Also, after looking at the front bumper, there seems to be no support bars/beams incorporated into the bumper, nothing b/t the bumper and engine at all, which worries me were the car to be in a frontal crash.  I am sure there are some things i have left out, but oh well.  In conclusion, this is a good car, but not really geared towards the younger crowd.  For a few $1000 more you could get a far superior car.... A SUBARU WRX all-wheel drive.  Also, I recommend the new Mazda 6 for under $20,000 over the Solara. My friend just got one.  Has 160HP vs. Solara 157HP. ITs a far superior car and looks sweet!!!
