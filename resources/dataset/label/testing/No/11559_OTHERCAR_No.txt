            you can not imagine how did i felt when i first sat in a Cherokee jeep!!
my first question was wether or not the driver's seat is adjusting by height...the answer was...no!!!
next question was if the seat is going back any more...the answer was...no!!!!
At that moment i decided that i was never going to buy Cherokee without checking anything else about this vehicle.
when you pay 45.000 $ the least you expect is that a man like me,(1,97m tall) can easily drive this jeep....imagine what else could i find, if i searched it in detail...I am fully disappointed by this company!!<br><br>
