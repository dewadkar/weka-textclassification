            When I first saw the CTS at a car show I said to myself &#147finally, a true sports sedan from the US&#148.  So when they became available in my area I immediately went out and took one for a test drive.  I thought it was a little slow but the dealer assured me that it would improve after a thousand miles or so.  I liked the styling and the feel of the car so feeling patriotic, I bought a silver automatic with all the options for a little more than $41,000.  Well, after 10,000 miles it was just as slow as it was when it was new.  I went back to the dealer and they checked it out and said it was fine and went on how it wasn&#146t supposed to be a drag racer.  Despite what my dealer said, I thought for sure there was something wrong with my car - it is a sports sedan after all.  I was ready to go to GM about it until a co-worker showed me Motor Trend&#146s Car of the Year article.  The fastest they could get to 60 mph in a CTS was 8 seconds!  Most of the cars in the test were faster including the Toyota Matrix wagon, the Mini Cooper S, even the 4 cylinder Honda Accord!  The handling numbers weren&#146t any better with the CTS bested in the skid pad and/or slalom by the entire group (except the Lincoln Town Car), which includes the Suzuki Aerio and Honda Civic Hybrid!  Needless to say, the CTS didn&#146t win Car of the Year.  

Aside from the lack of performance the car still fails to impress me.  The styling looks more odd to me the more I look at it - too many lines and creases (The creases on the &#147D&#148 pillar go in opposite directions).  Also, the paint chips easily, the interior isn&#146t laid out well and feels cheap, and the seats are uncomfortable on long trips.  It only has 20,000 miles on it and I&#146ve had to bring it back to the dealer several times for silly things like the radio not working, driver&#146s side window not working, trunk lid and rear door misaligned and leaking, rattles (most of which the dealer hasn&#146t been able to fix because they claim they can&#146t hear them), power driver&#146s seat not working, and some interior trim pieces coming loose.  I will probably have to bring it in again soon because the transmission is shifting hard and starting to slip a little.  I&#146ve done all the scheduled service on time and at the Cadillac dealer.  

Dealer service is about as good as the car.  That is to say, terrible.  Every time I go in for repairs or service they act like I&#146m putting them out and take way too long to do the repairs.  They had it for 2 weeks to fix the trunk and door.  On two occasions they didn&#146t have a loner car to give me, and one time they gave me a stripped out Chevy Cavalier!  The only time I got a Cadillac it was a Catera (which is even worse than the CTS) and it had an empty tank!  I had to go back and wait about a half hour until they filled it up.  

I am extremely disappointed with this car and my Cadillac Dealer.  I haven&#146t looked up the resale value but I am not expecting much.  I will probably be stuck with this slow piece of junk for a few more years.
