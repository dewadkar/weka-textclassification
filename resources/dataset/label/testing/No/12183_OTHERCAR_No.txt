            This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned.  It is nothing more than a highway permitted 4-wheeler.  There is no space for anything, the windshield is vertical and cracks frequently, it is cold in the winter and takes about 30 minutes to warm up...and then it is just luke-warm.  In the summer the A/C doesn't cool it down and taking the top off (which is a pain in the a**) it is hot unless driving fast.  It is noisy even with the hard top on and really can't exceed 80mph on the highway.  The seats are uncomfortable for anything longer then an hour drive.  There is no room for passengers (unless they are children) and then I wouldn't feel safe putting them in a removable seat with nothing holding it on but two pins).  You pay $22K for this vehicle with no luxuries when you *could* have a nice SUV.  I traded mine in yesterday for a used Explorer and I can't be happier.  I had my Jeep for 1.5 years and I regretted buying about a week after I had it.  When I went to sell it myself...no one was interested.  It depreciates in value quickly and anyone that has driven a Wrangler usually has the common sense not to buy one.  SO poor resale value.

Really, the only thing good about it is it's short turning radius and the fact that it is 4x4.  My suggestion:  get a 4-wheeler if you want a toy...get an SUV if you want an off-road vehicle.  

I just wish someone was as honest when I was researching Wranglers.
