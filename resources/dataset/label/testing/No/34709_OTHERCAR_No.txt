            In 1991 to accomodate our growing family we made the move to a mini van and bought a new mazda mpv.  I loved my van!  
Then within a year (still under warranty) and less than 10,000 miles we had to replace the tires twice. It turned out that the frame was bent and came that way from the factory. The mazda mechanic fixed the problem but they would not cover the tires under warranty even though it was caused by a defect from the factory.  That began to turn us sour on mazda.
Although it never had any major problems it did have some annoying problems like a noisy ticking noise that they never could find a reason for. It also had a very bad paint job, the paint was peeling off the front hood.  Also for the last year I drove it before we got a new van it squeaked something awful!! I was embarrased to drive it, you could hear me coming a mile away!  We tried to get that fixed too unsuccessfully.
I've sinced learned from several other people that they'd had the exact same problems with their mpv's even down to the paint peeling in the exact same places!
Also, being rear wheel drive it did not handle well in bad weather like snow and ice.
Although I did like my van in the beginning, after a few years I could hardly wait to get another van because of all the squeaks and noises etc.
I've since bought a new toyota sienna and LOVE it! 
I guess I'd have to say I probably would not buy another mazda.
It seems though that people seem to be happy with the new one to come out this year, but I'd stay away from the older used ones.<br><br>
