            I loved this car until everything started going wrong with it.  It has been in the shop numerous times just for recalls (how safe can that be).  Then it has been in the shop for repairs and they can never seem to find the problem.

Now for the good things.  The interior is very roomy and comfortable.  Ours is loaded with power everything which is great.  Power windows are the best when you are alone in the car and need that passenger window down, same with power door locks.  

The car gets decent gas mileage on the highway but really sucks it down in the daily driving around town.  

All in all we are pleased with it but are ready to pay it off and start with something else.<br><br>
