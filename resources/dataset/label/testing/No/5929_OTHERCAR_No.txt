            I have owned 2 Cherokees now and I just love the look of the Cherokee.  My most recent one that I purchased is a 1991.  I have had nothing but troubles with it.  I started by replacing the alternator, then the battery, and this continued with the egr valve and freeze plugs.  I have poured more money into it just to keep it running than I paid for it.  Just recently it started leaking oil like a sieve.  I assume that it's time for another costly repair.  I do love my Cherokee for 4-wheeling.  It climbs like no other vehicle that I have ever driven.  For this purpose, I hold on to it.  I do spend a considerable time in the hills and mountains around my home.  I would recommend this vehicle to someone that just loves 4-wheeling enough to front the cash to repair your vehicle.  Just for reference, I have owned this vehicle for less than two years now.<br><br>
