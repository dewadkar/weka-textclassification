            I just got through renting a 2001 Dodge SLT 4X2 Ram 1500 Quad-cab.  I had to rent it since my truck was broken into and I wanted to drive something that I would consider purchasing.  I'm glad I did because it gave me a good chance to get to know the truck and decide that I wasn't wild enough about it to buy it.

<b>Power:</b>  The truck I rented had a 5.2L V8.  This engine has 230 HP @ 4,400 rpm and 300 lb/ft of torque @ 3,200 rpm.  The numbers sound impressive enough, but it felt as though it was sluggish.  If you've ever driven a 2-stroke motorcycle or ATV then you know what I'm talking about.  When you floor the gas pedal, the engine pauses then jumps into action.  It's rather disappointing.

<b>Interior:</b>  The interior was all right as well.  The front seat was really roomy, but the back seat was lacking.  Also the seats were rather uncomfortable.  I took the truck on a 4-hour road trip and my back started hurting.  I would have loved to have my Chevy's seats in this truck.  A lumbar control would have been nice.  I liked the storage in the fold down arm-rest, but I didn't like the location of the latch.  I think the latch should have been front and center, but for some reason Dodge decided to put the latch on the left-hand (driver's) side.  It made it very inconvenient to use while sitting in the driver's seat.  I also couldn't stand the cloth seats.  The colored specks in the grey seats were appalling.  I know a lot of the car manufacturers are doing this, but I still don't like it.

<b>Options:</b>  I know this truck can have a lot of options.  Please see my epinion of the 1999 Dodge Ram 3500 for a list as they are practically the same.  I really can't tell you whether I would buy one if it had all the options, but I'm sure I would like it better.  That's not really fair, but it's honest.

<b>Overall:</b>  This truck is OK.  I wouldn't buy it without test driving the Ford, Chevy, and Toyota and I don't think it can stand up to the competition.  There's a lot of road noise that gets really annoying and the radio is really only good enough to barely block out the noise.  The truck has rugged good looks, but that's about the best thing I can say about it.<br><br>
