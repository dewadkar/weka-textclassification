            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a quality vehicle.  A good ride, strong safety features, and large amount of cabin space are excellent qualities of this well-made vehicle, but, is it worth the money that it costs? 

As most everyone knows, the SUV car models is one of the fastest growing industries, with the Jeep being one of the standard names in the field.  The Grand Cherokee is the luxury SUV.  It is priced from $26,000 to $34,000 new.  I don't believe that it is worth that much money.  It is very sluggish to drive, when compared to cars of similar size, and really doesn't have that many incredible features, or trademarks, to make it worth so much money.  If you're in the mood for an SUV, bargain, or move on.<br><br>
