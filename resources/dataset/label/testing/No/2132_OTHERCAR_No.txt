            I'm writing this opinion after being told two days ago that we will need a major engine overhaul/replacement for the third time since we have owned the car.  Needless to say, I am not happy about it. 

Granted, we are talking about a nearly 10 year old car here, but 3 major engine problems?!  Good grief!!!  I would just chalk it up to my husband and I having terrible luck with cars, but we have been told by several mechanics that the engines in these cars are notorious for having problems. That is why I am writing this opinion--to say, "Buyer beware."

We have been told by several different mechanics that these particular engines are notorious for having cracked head gaskets.  Now, to tell you the truth, I have no idea what a head gasket is for.  All I know is that the fact that they are cracked makes the repair very costly.  We paid $6500 for it 4 1/2 years ago.  We figure that we could have bought a $12,000 car and not been any worse off if you figure in all of the major repairs we've had.  We could have paid a little more each month rather that having to come up with $1500 all at once for a major repair.

My advice if you are considering a '93 Dodge Spirit is to read the other opinions on it here, check out the Consumer Reports, and have a reliable mechanic check out the engine before you buy it.
