                As I looked on the roads through a variety of states.  I saw a tremendous amount of the Chevy <b>Cavilier</b>. This is what prompted me to purchase one.  Let me say now that the next time I consider a purchase due to an excessive amount of consumer participation I intend to remember this experience.

    This car has become a royal pain in my side. For one thing the key 75% of the time refuses to turn , apparently due to the locking steering wheel.  On one occasion a gentleman attempted to come to my aid at a service station and upon entering the vehicle the plastic around the bottom of the seat broke.  I have has said plastic repaired twice now on the drivers side and once on the passenger side.  I have had one wheel crack and break for no apparent reason, which was not covered on the warranty.  I have dealt with two recalls in two years.  

    Let me also state that the antilock brakes leave much to be desired as well.  I live in Michigan and we have alot of rain and snow and these brakes are a nightmare .  They make an awful sound almost like bumping along in a sad effort to engage.  All you manage to do is slide through whatever you intended to avoid.  In as much as the shocks represent consider it safe to say , you get the feeling you are on horseback with every bump you encounter.

     The<b> Cavilier </b>has an air bag that looks like a bulge on the steering wheel leaving me wondering if it would even open.  The back seat does fold down but due to the narrowness it doesn't offer much more room.  I've had trouble with the locks freezing to the extent that I just don't lock it up in the winter at all, and for some reason this particular model has no rear window defrost either.

    Personally I regret my purchase and don't recommend this car to anyone.  Apparently one should consider &quot;you get what you pay&quot; for as the sticker price clearly represents the quality of the car......<br><br>
