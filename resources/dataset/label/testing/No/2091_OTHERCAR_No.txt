            I purchased a used 1990 Sunbird a few years ago.  From day one, I had nothing but problems with the vehicle.  The first major problem was that the engine temperature gauge failed to work.  When I took it to the dealership, they said that since the dash was a cluster of gauges, all of the gauges would have to be replaced.  The mechanic at the dealership told me that this was a common problem with the Sunbird.  The worst thing is that this &quot;common problem&quot; costs several hundred dollars.  This was the start of many problems with this vehicle.  The car developed a bad starter cellanoid which caused the vehicle to stall while in transit several times.  The car was in the garage more often than anyone could imagine.  I purchased this car for work travel so as to avoid mileage build-up on my other car.  What a major mistake.  After breaking down several times and unimaginable amounts of stress, I got rid of the car.  I did a bit of research on the car and noticed that the problems my car had were not uncommon on Sunbirds.  In my efforts, to save money and mileage, this ended up costing me several hundred dollars. An expensive lesson in Economics.<br><br>
