            Having used several 2+ megapixel cameras, I was eager to see what FujiFilm would come up with in their offering.  In the end I was disappointed.  The camera is fairly solid and lighter than the size may first imply.  It sports a 3x optical zoom and real image viewfinder with diopter adjustment.  A macro mode allows close-ups.  The camera features a manual and automatic mode like most of the other cameras in its class.  The MX-2900, like others, calculates the aperture and shutter for you when in automatic mode, which gives you quick point-and-shoot capabilities.  An 8MB SmartMedia card, rechargable battery, AC adapter, separate Mac and PC serial cables, RCA video cable, lens cap and software CDs are included with the camera.

<b>Features</b>
When in manual mode, you can choose settings for aperture, shutter speed, white balance, flash intensity, capture mode (single or continuous) and EV adjustment.  Some notes about these controls: only two aperture settings are possible (f4 and f7) and possible shutter speeds differ between the two aperture settings.  The camera has a default of turning off the LCD when capturing images.  The LCD can be used for framing an image, but when switching between playback and capture, the LCD would turn off and needed to be turned back on if not using the viewfinder to frame images.  This may have been done to dissuade users from relying too much on the LCD which drains batteries quickly (as with all digital cameras).  Speaking of batteries, the MX-2900 uses an NS-80 LiIon battery that sports a fairly impressive life.  Charging is done in the camera using the supplied AC adapter.  Menu controls are fairly simple to navigate using the 4-way directional buttons.  Separate flash and macro mode buttons are present.  A note - when the macro mode is set or the flash mode is set, the settings are not displayed on the main color LCD, rather they are only displayed on the small gray LCD on top of the camera that also indicates the remaining battery life and remaining number of pictures.  Goofy looking LEDs light up in sequence when powering on the camera, switching modes or performing an action such as saving or deleting an image.  The camera also beeps when these same actions are taken, but the beeping can be turned off.  When actually taking a picture, the zoom is quick and auto focus is equally fast.  When auto focusing (by depressing the shutter button halfway), the camera makes a noise very similar to a shutter click and some of the people I took pictures of would move before the actual picture was taken.  Playback of images was a little slow, but not excessively.  Images viewed on the camera were noticably lighter than what you ended up with on the PC.  When zooming in on pictures in playback mode on the camera, the camera allows you to zoom in up to 4x but in reality it seems as though the camera zooms up to 2x and then simply increases the pixel size up to 4x.  Panning (scrolling) through images requires using two hands to hold down two separate buttons.  The camera includes Adobe PhotoDeluxe software as well as software for transferring the images to the PC.  I use Adobe PhotoShop, so I did not load the PhotoDeluxe software.  I did use the included TWAIN plug-in to allow transfer of images directly from the camera into PhotoShop.  The software was simple to operate, but a quick reference to the manual was necessary to find the installer on the CD.  Also, I had occasional error messages indicating a failed transfer when the transfer appeared to be completed successfully.

Overall, as far as features go, the camera is fairly easy to use and sports an above average number of features.  Its not the best designed camera I've seen, but it's not the worst either.

<b>Image Quality</b>
Image quality on this camera needs improvement.  Some settings on the camera allow you to choose the sharpness, size and level of compression.  But even with the settings set to the best possible, image quality was disappointing.  Fine details were often blurred together.  Hot spots in highlights were hard to eliminate.  Noise in shadow areas was much more visible than in other 2+ megapixel cameras I've used.  Color accuracy seemed fairly accurate in midtones, but with the hot spots in highlights and noise in shadows, overall image quality was poor.  Considering the high quality of the images captured by competing cameras, I would not recommend this camera.  If you are seriously considering this camera, try looking at the Nikon CoolPix 950 or Olympus C2000-Z instead.<br><br>
