            I am 20 years old and have a strong interest in cars.  The 95 Concorde is not one of them.  My father bought the car for me for my 17th birthday.  I have been driving it for 3 years now and have invested enough money in the thing to almost buy a new car.  From the very beginning there was problems.

The AC didn't work when we bought it but it was a simple repair that the used car dealership happily paid for.  That would be the last problem that came free to me.  The tie rods rusted out or broke and they had to be replaced.  The AC broke again.  The fuses for the cigarette lighter and the horn kept blowing.  The engine temperature control computer stopped working leading to many overheats and antifreeze overflows- this can be embarassing when you go to pick up a date in high school and your car appears to be smoking.  

That is only the big problems.  There were other smaller ones such as power window failure and windshield fluid pump breaking.

My other main concern is the design of the cooling system.  The geniuses at Chrysler wanted to put the radiator, which is made of aluminum, in the front where rocks can hit it and puncture it.  Radiators are not cheap- i had to replace it.

Other than that, the car is great.  <br><br>
