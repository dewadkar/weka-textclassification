            a good friend of mine once owned a 1986 mercury sable ls wagon. it was her spare car for emergencies and i used it on days when my peppy lil civic was being serviced at every 1000 miles(read my review) and i must say this car was one of the most disapointing things ever willed into reality.

the car had saved ford/lincoln/mercury in 1986 with it revolutionary styling that is still enjoy looking at today, and it was on car and drivers 10 best list 7 years in a row. but that doesnt make up for the nightmare me and my friend went through.

this particular sable was owned by a woman who left it in a barn a few years after she bought it in michigan. its wiring had been chewed up by mice who live in the barn. in 1992 she brought the car here to denver where she sold it.

my friend bought this car in 1997 for $1000. the car had a bit of rust here and there and needed a little work but it began as a good car for her son and an emergency car for her. it was an ls-the most luxurious sable trim level-it had everything but a sunroof. but the room and comfort isnt worth what she spent on that car.

first the tranny blew and it cost her 3500 to replace, it had blown again a month and 1/2 later costing 5000. so far she spent 8500-do you see a problem yet?

then in 1997-october we had a blizzard in denver and after that it had been a gamble weather the car would start, the heat would work, the lights would work, etc, to have the car checked by the mercury people, cost 2000. now we have spent 10500.

in february the transmisson blew again for the third time in less than 5 months so she decided to have the whole engine rebuilt and a new transmisson put in and this cost 7000. we had spent 17500. 

the car worked fine until july when the fourth and final trans misson blew-by this point she quit spending money and sold it to a man for $100. eventually her came back telling us that the car had caught on fire and was gone forever.

that showed me there is a god.
