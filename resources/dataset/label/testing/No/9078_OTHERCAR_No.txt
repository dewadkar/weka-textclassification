            If there is one thing that my husband has tried to instill in me over the past few years we have been together it is that cheaper is not always better.  We purchased our KIA Sportage EX (luxury model) in November of 1997.  We had recently had our third child and were living on a modest salary (my husband being in the military).  The KIA Sportage seemed like such a great value.  It was reasonably priced and came loaded with all of the bells and whistles for a low price of around $17,000.00.  

Against my husbands better judgement we purchased our vehicle.  Within days our Sportage had to go in the shop for waranty repairs.  At first it seemed like only minor issues such as the passenger door wouldn't open the lock on the drivers door wouldn't work, but then we kept experiencing problems with the check engine light coming on.  To make a long story short in the year and a half that we owned this car it went into the shop 9 times.  

Upon my husband's reassignment to Texas, KIA agreed (after months of arguing) to assist us in a trade out of this vehicle on the stipulation that we purchase another Sportage.  We were desperate and so we took them up on their offer.  

We purchased our 99' Sportage in January of this year.  It has also been a complete let down.  The air conditioning unit has been repaired on 4 different occasions for leaking.  At one time I had to have it towed into the dealer because there was water pouring out from under the dash board of the car.  The window rolls up crooked causing the gasket to get mashed up inside the window.  And most recently while I was driving my boss and his wife to the airport, my car lost power, the ability to steer, and slipped out of gear.  

When people ask me how I like my KIA, I strongly recommend to them NEVER BUY A KIA.  They are the poorest made vehicle we have ever had the misfortune to own.  Please don't be fooled by the low price.  If there is anything good that I have gotten from my experience of owning a KIA, it has been to learn that my husband isn't always wrong and in this case he was very right.  CHEAPER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER.  <br><br>
