            My wife and I purchased a 1995 Saturn brand new in May 1995. When we purchased the vehicle it was because of the quality reputation that Saturn has.  After owning the vehicle for 5 years I have mixed feelings about the vehicle.  Although it is comfortable to drive and handles very well, I have found it to be somewhat unreliable.  The computer chip has gone out in it twice.  The trunk leaked to the point that we had to have the rear hatch seal replaced.  The battery needs to be replaced every 2 years, even though the repair techs cannot find anything wrong with the charging system.  The dome light inside the car continually falls off and refuses to stay where it belongs. It has also begun to burn about a quart of oil every 2-weeks.  I was told by the Service dept. that that was normal for a Saturn.  I feel that burning oil at that rate is not good.  Also the brakes are jerky.  I know that Saturn has a great reputation and their service dept. has made every attempt to make my service experience enjoyable.  However I feel that the vehicle itself is not as reliable as I has hoped.  I also feel that it is inconvenient for service.  You have to take the vehicle to their dealership for repair.  Their are no independent authorized service centers for Saturn.  I am sure this is because Saturn wants to maintain control of the service, however if you live 100 miles from the nearest service center it makes it difficult to take in for service.  As far as comfort and feel the car is a dream to drive. I take the car on lang trips and it drives beautifully.  I will have to say that in the future I will probably not buy another Saturn<br><br>
