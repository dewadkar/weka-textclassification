            While I do not own this vehicle personally, my father does.  He purchased this vehicle last October 1998 as they first hit the lots.  The Denali was a sight to behold!  Wonderful interior, comfy seats, great features, but as time has marched on, it's shown some uglier aspects.  

These came to light as my mother purchased a 1999 Chevy Tahoe the following February.  In comparison, my dad's truck was, well, driving like a truck.  It was rattling, the ride was not smooth and the body was showing signs of failure!  

He has had persistent problems with the alignment of the vehicle.  And you must understand that dad does not 4-wheel it anywhere - this is strictly his luxury truck that goes to and from work and down an occasional dirt road.  It's never seen extreme conditions besides 15 inches of snow.  The radio antenna was not hooked up at the factory, the rear windows failed.  The usual onslaught of problems accompanied by a first year first run vehicle.

To sum it up, dad has stated that he'd buy my MOM'S Chevy Tahoe in a minute.  Not only was it at least $10,000 less, but it has stood the test of time with no reported problems except for standard oil changes and tire rotations.

The Denali is something to look at, but for the price, you may be better served with a regular Yukon or Tahoe.<br><br>
