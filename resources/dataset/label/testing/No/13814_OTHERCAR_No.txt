            I leased a new Mercedes S420 car in 1995. I had to change the engine on this car after I had put 132000 miles on it most of which were HWY miles.The car was always maintained by an authorized Mercedes dealer.
 The bill for Changing the engine came to little over $23000. Comparable repair on a Lexus420 is $14000 and on Cadillac Seville about $10000.

 Dealing with the Mercedes People in the USA was no fun. When asked for a name of a person that one could talk to about the cost of repairs the response was &quot;we can not disclose that but someone will contact you&quot;. For one week no one contacted. The dealer on the other hand was some what co-operative and finally through his efforts I was able to speak to the Area manager of the Mercedes. His attitude can be summed up in one sentence  &quot;Customer is always wrong and Mercedes is always right&quot;.

The car has been returned to the dealer at the end of the lease. The Mercedes has asked me to pay them another $15000 because of higher gas mileage. When I add all the numbers including the maintenance it has cost me about $125000 to run this car for 5 years. Including the cost of gas it works to about $1/mile to operate this car.This number for Lexus LS400 Which my wife drives comes to about $0.50/mile. 
 In nutshell: Mercedes is over rated, they are very arrogant to deal with and the repair costs are excessive. I would not touch them with a ten foot pole..............Ashok K. Moza, akm@chemicalsinc.com <br><br>
