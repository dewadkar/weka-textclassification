                 I thought hard and long about voicing my opinion on this but I decided that others should know what's it's like to purchase a car (DEMO, 1100 miles at time of purchase, 1991) and have nothing but problems from day one!

     I was previously married to a GM man who believed that they were the best vehicles on the market. I just started working after my 1st daughter was born and I had made some commission checks so I wanted to buy a reliable car (Had a 76 ElCamino) that fit more then 2 and was reliable. I went out on this venture on my own (can't blame him, which is a shame since I divorced him that year!)

     Two weeks after I bought the car, the air conditioner went, now mind you I live in Florida and it was AUGUST! Here I go one afternoon back to the dealership to get this resolved. No problem I was told by the service department, under warranty and we will only need the car for 3 days. Ok I said and off in a rental I went.

     About 6 months later (warranty was about out now) I was driving and next thing I know, nothing was happening. I apparently Blew the transmission. Now mind you again, I am a mother of a young child, I do not race and to this day have never had a ticket. I call my ex-husband who says I am too rough on it and that it will cost me $300.00 for a used transmission from the junk yard. Well my friends that was only the beginning.

     I paid the car off 3 years ago (the original loan was $10,000) and I spent over $5000.00 replacing the transmission 3 times by 3 different people. I must say it's THE CAR!!! I know this because I bought my current vehicle right after this and I haven't blown that transmission.

     I would highly recommend you STAY AWAY FROM THE PONTIAC GRAND AM! This is adviseable unless you have a lot of money to burn.<br><br>
