            Not what they say

This vehicle is an okay car for someone that only drives a few mile per day.  It was definitely not designed to have for road trips.  I purchased mine because of the great advertising that they had.  The Saturn Company stands behind each vehicle they make.  Right!  I have had nothing but trouble with mine since it hit 37000 miles.  The warranty is only good for the first 36000 miles.  

I have made numerous calls to the Saturn dealership as well as to the customer service number listed in the manual.  This is nothing but a farce.  I never get a returned call, nor have I gotten any of the repairs done as a warranty recall.

You start hearing the roar of the engine when the vehicle reaches 40,000 miles .  This is due to the fact the the chain is now stretched.  I was told that was due to my lengthy road trips and the engine getting hot.  Even thought they had a reason for this the auto has yet to be repaired.  It now sounds like a tank when running.

This car was definitely not made for anyone that drives more than 100 miles per week.  Great for in town driving, but not for long trips.<br><br>
