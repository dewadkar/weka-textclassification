            I love my 1997 4 L SE and plan on keeping it but I have experienced severe leaks at the roof to body seal above the windshield.  This happens every time I change from soft top back to hardtop.  So far it has been under warranty but now I am on my own.  I am surprised there is not a single mention of this problem in other opinions....am I the only one?  I do know of one other jeep owner who has the same problem.  Maybe most jeeps are driven in climates that only need a soft top.
And yes, I am very careful when I remove the top.  And yes, it was a factory installed hardtop.  The Chrysler fix for this leak is to seal the top to the body which of course almost guarantees a leak when you try to remove the hardtop the next year.
I would recommend the 6 cylinder engine, metal doors and the hardtop(for those cold Canadian winters).  One thing that bothers me about the 1997 design versus older designs;  the side view mirrors are mounted on the metal doors so it is illegal to drive your jeep on roads(at least in Canada).  You have to buy option mirrors that attach to the body.  Note this is a change from the CJ7 design which had the mirrors mounted directly on the body.
The ride is rough and noisy...but hey, its a jeep.  Its got offroad capabilities like no other vehicle and is probably the lowest cost(or nearly so) convertible there is.
Who should buy this vehicle?  People who have done there homework and know what a jeep is all about.  Let's have a end to the complaints about rough ride and noisy interior.<br><br>
