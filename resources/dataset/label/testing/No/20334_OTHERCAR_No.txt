            In 1996, I was looking to buy a new car that would last for the next 7-10 years.  That's not expecting a lot since I drive about 10K a year.  

J.D. Power Associates rated the Altima... &quot;Best Initial Deal&quot;.  And to be quite honest, I got great financial terms for my 1996 Black Altima GXE.  Here is where the depressing story begins... check this out...

Within the next 8 months, the factory alarm disabled my car three times.  The shift module (Park, Reverse, Drive) locked up.  That is usually a sign that the transmission is badly damaged.  Most mechanics would agree that this type of problem usually doesn't happen until the end the car's life.  I tried getting it fixed at the dealership.  Even one of the mechanics commented that the initial repairs I was making would mean more trouble in the future.  I think I was most fed up when I was making a client visit for business.  My reliable Nissan wouldn't start and I wasn't able to get home for four hours.

One more thing, never work with a WONDERIES Dealership.  I told them about the lemon.  I had about 30 pages of mechanic receipts.  But they were not sympathetic.  In 8 months, the Altima spent 3 of them at the Nissan Dealer Mechanic.   

I called Nissan USA in Torrance, CA.  This is what they said: &quot;Best Initial Deal means just that.. it's initially a quality purchase but not something that should last forever.&quot;  When I told them I got a lemon, they said &quot;That happens, sorry about that.&quot;  The offered me a $100 rebate on the car purchase.

I am sure this Altima story isn't the worse.  I lost $7,000 on the car... when I sold it back to get in Acura Integra.  And I spent many weekends and nights talking to the mechanics and service managers at WONDERIES NISSAN.  Please, don't make the same mistake.
