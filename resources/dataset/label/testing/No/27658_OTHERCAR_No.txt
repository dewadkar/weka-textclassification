            First of all, I have a '95 Hyundai Accent, its a two door and it is pink.  The color is most of the reason that I bought it.  At first I loved it, I thought that since it was so cute and so compact, it would be a great car.  I have to admit that this is a very good car as far as how it runs and the gas milage is excellent, but if you are looking for a nice little family car, this is not for you.  The leg room in the front seats are great, but the back seat is another story, its awful.  
Also, the car that I got, I went to trade in after about a year of having it and it has already lost over $5,000 dollars in value, so it is almost like I should have never even gotten it.  Now I do wish that I wouldn't have bought it.  So I definately would not buy one if that is your plan.<br><br>
