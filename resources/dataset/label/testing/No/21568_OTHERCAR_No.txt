            Ever have a love hate relationship with a vehicle? Well that�s exactly the way I felt about my 95 Eagle Vision. As this version is no longer made by Chrysler I decided the Intrepid page would be a good place to locate this article since they were/are essentially the same car. 

The Vision is an exceptional car in many ways, although some may argue the point, to me it was and still is better looking than the Intrepid. Styling and size caught my eye immediately upon seeing this vehicle for the first time. And I wasn�t at all disappointed with a test drive. The car had adequate acceleration, great vision front and rear, lots of room (one of its better points), and a firm but not harsh suspension. 

One would think after building cars for over three generations your average car company would be able to get it right. But not so with Chrysler, after purchasing this vehicle it didn�t take very long to become annoyed with headlights that barely lit up the road. Upon voicing my complaint the dealership promptly replaced the bulbs per Chryslers recommendation. Although I saw an improvement they remained a source of aggravation throughout the ownership of the vehicle. Older drivers with poor night vision would be advised to avoid this car for that reason.

Unfortunately there were several other annoying quality issues that popped up during my four year ownership of this vehicle. A hood cable release broke after 3 months, and believe it or not this same cable failed two more times, the last time out of the warranty period at a cost to repair of $90.00. During the winter months the transmission would not always go into park so you couldn�t turn the engine off without a wait plus the tranny also developed something called �morning sickness�, on cold days it might take 4 or 5 seconds before it decided to go into gear. The air conditioner stopped working after the 3rd summer, transmission cooler lines had to be replaced, all things I�ve never encountered previously with new vehicle ownership. 

Even with all its problems I liked this car well enough (due to its ride and drive) to go out and purchase another Chrysler vehicle, specifically  one of the newly designed Concorde�s.  If I had it to do over again I wouldn�t, the car is a looker with plenty of room and a great ride but if you�re in the market for a used vehicle I�d suggest you look elsewhere unless you have a friend that�s a good mechanic.   <br><br>
