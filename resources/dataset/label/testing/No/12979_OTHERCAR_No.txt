            These are all the reviews and updates on my experiences with this car from the most recent back to when I bought the car.

UPDATE TWO: (7/30/02)

The car was taken on a trip down south, and while braking at highway speeds (60-70 mph) the front end would shake when the brakes were applied.  When we got back, we took it to the dealer and they said they checked the brakes and found no problems.  Two weeks later, the problem gets worse and the front brakes start grinding, very loudly I might add.  After being told I'd have to wait 2 weeks for an appointment, I not-so-calmly spoke with the service manager and demanded they get the car in immediately because they missed the problem the first time around.  And they did.  The diagnosis:  Warped rotors...after only 8000 miles of city driving?  I was given the BS excuse that since I live up north, the rotors heat up and cool down quicker than other places in the country and are prone to warping.  The problem is, I've owned a number of new cars and have never had that problem with any of them but the Rio.  But I was informed that they would fix it under warranty "once or twice until it becomes regular maintanence."  Am I stupid, or should rotors last AT LEAST 3 years??  So, the brakes are fine now, however I'm not smiling too much because I was also informed that Kia did not redesign these rotors, so I'm sure they'll be replaced again in another 6 months.  If anyone from Kia is reading this,  you can bet your butt I will not pay for one of these rotor replacements!  If the rotors go again, we are trading it in Aparently, after doing some research on the web, Kia's are notorious for this.  

Also, the hood has an alarmingly large number of chips for such a new car...some are chipped right down to the metal, and up north can become a concern with the excessive amount of corrosive salt used on the roads.  So now the body shop awaits me... 

The suspension is also becoming increasingly bouncy.


Mechanically, I have no complaints.  The motor, transmission, etc. are all all fine and I have not any problems...IE, the stuff covered by the warranty is fine.  The "non-warranty" items like the paint, and brakes have some issues.   If the rotors go again, we are getting rid of it and buying something else.  

The resale on this thing is horrible.  After only 8 months, the value has dropped over $3000.

We were all set to buy another one when these issues came up.  We have decided not to buy another Kia and go with a Cavalier instead.   


UPDATE ONE: (1/4/02)

This problem was with third party items, not the car itself.   

One thing you may want to inquire about when getting this car is the tires.  I started to experience some steering wheel movement after a couple hundred miles.  The wheel would kind of wobble back and forth every now and then at slower speeds.  I was told that the tires were already out of balance, and so they had to be rebalanced.  The problem has so far disappeared.    You do get a 50,000/ 5 year warranty on the tires, but they are manufactured by some brand called "Kumho," and the dealer does not handle repair or replacement issues other than balancing, etc.  Thats not too uncommon a situation with alot of new cars you buy, but around here there's only one shop that deals with that brand, as opposed to better known brands like Goodyear, etc. that can be serviced just about anywhere.  Before you buy, ask where the tires can be serviced (if need be) and if you can get a different brand, so that you dont have to drive 30 miles to the nearest Kumho dealer.  (Kumho??? sounds awfully vulgar, doesnt it?)

Secondly, the pinstriping has started to come off on the front panels.   Now I cant totally blame this on whoever put it on becuase it was buried under 4 feet of snow (literally) for 2 and a half days in the Buffalo snow storm of December 2001.  Perhaps it came off when we were digging out the car, but still...some of the neighbors have 10 year old cars that were buried just as long and their pinstriping was still intact.  I now have to get in touch with the dealer's pinstriping "artist" to get the situation resolved.  Honestly, if it were me buying this car over again, I would ask the dealer to remove the pinstriping before i get it.  It doesnt seem that high quality.  

My Kia dealer was very polite and prompt in servicing my car.  I was in and out in about an hour, although i did have to wait 9 days for the soonest appointment.  They're not there on weekends.  Also make sure you ask what their service hours are when you buy!  One idea is to call and make a phony appointment just to see how long you have to wait to get it in.  But of course, be considerate and cancel the appt later on!  
  
 


(12/01) 

I havent had the car that long, so I'm not going to say "rush out and buy it," because with any product, its easy to be wowed during that honeymoon period.  What I will do is tell you what I like and dislike about the car based on the short time I've had it.  But as for reliability and such, I can't say right now.  I will update if need be, but Im hoping I wont have to.

So, my first impressions of my new Kia Rio...

So far I love it.  It's everything you'd expect from a car this price and more.  For 10K, you can get a brand new car with A/C and a good warranty. 

The interior room is more than sufficent.  The head room is incredible...I test drove a Neon and Cavalier and I felt claustrophobic, especially the Neon.   (Im not that tall, 5' 11").  Not so in the Rio.  There's easily room to accomodate a 6'4" plus driver.  Alot of people complained about the backseat being cramped.  Again for my size, I dont have as much room as I would in a Lincoln of Cadillac, but it's enough to sit comfortably for drives around town.
What do you expect from a sub-compact sedan?  

The front seats are pretty comfortable.  What I was surprised to find was that the driver's seat is adjustable in four directions, which is very nice.  It is definitely possible to get very good support for your back from this seat.  Too bad its not on the passenger side as well.  There also is a fold down armrest for your right arm, also another plus for me.  Especially since this car is a 5 speed.   And it has dual airbags and tilt steering too. 

The only real complaint I have in regards to interior room is the lack of clearance space for your feet.  When shifting and braking, my feet are often touching the wires and such under the dash.  Well, brushing by really, but still.  In addition, the pedals are a little too small and close together for my tastes.  But I'll get used to it.  No power locks or windows?  Who cares!  Never used them before, i dont the extra "effort" to crank a window or open a lock.   The way I look at it, its two less things that will break.  And power windows and locks ALWAYS break.  

The trunk space is absolutely insane.  It's an unbelievably deep trunk for a car this size.     
 
The instrumenation cluster is sparse, but has all you need.  A tach would have been nice, but I always shifted by ear anyway so its not that big a deal.  The layout of the lights is a little weird as well.  Someone else wrote that taller drivers may have a hard time seeing the turn signals, and they were right.  Its not that bad, but takes some getting used to.  
I dont like how the rear defroster light is next to the speedometer.  Its way out of place there and annoyingly bright.  Another thing I dont like is the cheap looking black plastic for the center console.  But point A to point B is all that matters to me!  

The radio is sufficient, but not great.  Theres no bass/treble adjustment, only tone.  But again, a car for me is transportation, not a sound studio so it doesnt bother me, but some people take car audio seriously.

The heater in this car is the best friggin car heater ever.  It pumps out booming heat by the time I'm halfway down the road!  You'll never turn the temp past halfway unless you live in the Yukon or something.  The AC is so cold you could hang meat inside the car. 

I dont like the AC going on for the defrosters, but for some reason all korean cars do that.  Dont know why, who wants to pump out the AC in January?

As far as drivability, I dont know what people are complaining about with this engine.  The speed limit is 65 folks, how fast do you really need to go?  It aint a mustang by any means, but its not as much of a dog out of first gear as the cavaliers and Neons are.  No problems for me as far as horsepower goes,  for what its rated, its actually quite peppy.  The engine is admittedly a little bit louder under hard acceleration then some other cars i test drove, but no big deal.  On the highway you'd be hard pressed to hear alot of wind noise.  Its surprisingly quiet as far as wind noise goes.  The 5 speed is very fun to drive, although the shifter isnt terribly precise.  5th gear is out in no-mans land, but yes, again, I'll get used to it.
  

And last but not least, the styling is also a plus.  Its just transportation, but its nice to be driving a nice looking car.  

Like I said, I cant vouch for reliablilty yet, but based on the car's performance I dont think it should be that much of a problem...at least i hope.  But you cant go wrong.  Kia offers 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain coverage 5 year/60k bumper to bumper coverage, and 5 year/unlimited milage roadside assistance.

If there are no updates, that means all is well in my Rio world!  Hope I helped your decision.  I know how much a pain in the a$$ buying a car is, and hopefully i made your life a little easier.  I suppose your second best option at this price is to find a certified used Honda civic with about 30-40k on it.  But for me, the Rio offered the most as far as standing behind me and being there should a repair ever arise, and for a long time too.
