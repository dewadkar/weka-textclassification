            My mother and I went out to a Dodge Dealership, as soon as we heard that the 1998 Dodge Stratus was in. Her car before this purchase had broken down and she was renting an Intrepid and we were told by the dealer that the Stratus' were exactly the same thing only smaller and a little more affordable. Anyway, she decided to go with the Stratus at the time of purchase it only had 11 miles on it and at first we were both totally head over heels in love with this car. Well, that soon changed, just a week after she purchased the car, her breaks started squeaking, very badly. She took it back to the dealership(where she has gone MANY times before) and they said it was normal. Then about a week later, still squeaking, her breaks went out on her. She took it back to the dealership and they replaced them, at her cost, not their's. Then about a month after that, she had to have not one, not two, but all four tires replaced because the tread was gone. Again, at her cost. Plus, one of the headlights and the taillights went out and she had to have those replaced.
Ever since she bought this car she has had problems with it, the alignment is always bad, breaks have been replaced 4 times since the first time, due to squeaking and going out, the tires, 3 times and the battery twice. She would return it, but because she has a loan out for it, she can't return it until its paid. She totally got taken for a 'ride', no pun intended. She has written to the makers of Dodge and to dealerships, no one is willing to help her, let alone take any responsibility for the poorly made product.
She and I have even gone as far to stop people who also drive the Stratus, of any year and inquire about any problems or frustrations about this car. We have stopped maybe a total of 200 people since 1998, and have only gotten 12 positive reviews about this car. 
The car is absolutely beautiful, we still love the way it looks, but as far as everything else is concerned, well, enough said.<br><br>
