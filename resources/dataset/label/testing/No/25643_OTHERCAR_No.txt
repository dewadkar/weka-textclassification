            We rented a Saab 9-5 from Enterprise for about
$75/day including all taxes/fees/insurance for a long weekend last year (maybe Labor Day).

It was my first time driving a European car and it was great!
It was peppy, smooth, comfortable, and safe.
It really handled well made you feel 'connected' to the road.
I always thought that was marketing mumbo jumbo until I drove this.

Of course we only had it a few days so it may not be a 
meaningful comparison but it still remains the most fun car we've ever driven.

We even drove it around Atlanta on 285 which was about 65 miles in about 45 min - an avg speed of almost 88 mph!
The max cruising speed in this car is around 90 mph.

Features we loved:
* radio/cd controls on the wheel
* the side light that comes on when you use the indicator -
this makes a huge difference when driving along hwy/roads
with little to no lights - it lights up the entire side of the car for greater visibility
* the 'ass' fan - we did not really know what it was called
but it was great - blowing hot or cold air up your butt in the driver &amp; passenger seats
* the seat/mirror settings memory that could be set to your
levels which was helpful when we wanted to quickly switch drivers
* huge deep trunk
* very comfy seats up front - they suck you in - its kind of hard to get out!
* the ignition key goes in near the 'stick' in the middle of the seats -
its kind of unusual but once you get used to it, its a lot easier since you don't have to go around the wheel
* there is a single switch for the power moonroof for both sliding &amp; tilting which makes for a less cluttered overhead console

It did not look like such a great deal at $35 - 40 K when new but its great fun to drive.<br><br>
