            I definitely woke up on the wrong side of the cave today, cause I�m gonna write an opinion on a subject I shouldn�t be�cars. Actually one car in particular.  And I�m doing it cause I gotta bi<i></i>tch about something. The car I�m referring to is the absolutely fabulous, wonder car, the 1992 Subaru Loyale. <b> So read this with the thought in mind that I am stating my opinion (not yours-so if you don�t like what I have to say�go away) about this car and my experiences.</b> I�m no mechanic, but I do know how to do some work on cars, so I�m also not a complete idiot when it comes to this here car either.  

To start off with,  here is some boring information about the car for all you anal &quot;detail&quot; buffs who need to know about engine size, options, etc.  

Mode type: 4 Door Sedan, 2 wheel drive (front)
Engine: 4 Cylinder, 1.8 Liter, 90 Horsepower Engine 
Miles per gallon: 20 (If I�m lucky, which sucks for a 4 banger). 
Options: Power windows, power locks, A/C, auto seat belts
Color: Gray

If you need more info, too bad, read the manual.  Now for the important part, my feelings for this vehicle.

It was not by choice that I now drive this car.  To make a long story short, my wife needed a new, correction, another car while we were in college, and this one was sold to us at, what we thought was, a suitable price, from our mechanic (wrong).  That was about 3 years ago.  At the time it only had about 45K miles on it.  So I figured, it shouldn�t have too many problems with that kind of mileage.    With that thought, I became excessively more stupid than I already was. 

For those of you fortunate enough not to have driven a Subaru (excluding the newer models), let me fill you in on some things you aren�t missing out on.  First, if you�ve driven one, you�ve driven them all.  Out of all the ones that I have had to drive, for one reason or another, they all have the same dashboard.  I think the engineers first developed a dashboard, and then designed every car in their repertoire around it.  So I have a 4 banger with a speedometer that goes up to 120 mph.  Talk about a paradox. 

To give you an idea of why this shouldn�t be, let me say this.  <i>This car does not run on gas.  When I need to refuel, that means I buy some cheese, open the hood, and feed the mouse that is running on his wheel.  If I have no cheese, I open the floor panel and make like the Flinstones. </i>  Needless to say, there is NO power to this thing.  This has to be one of the weakest 4 cylinders I have driven.  

I was not really involved with this purchase per say (big mistake and a long story), I just knew it was happening.  So when I went to change the oil after it was purchased, I opened the hood and &quot;Sweet mercy, what the hell is that in the engine? Is that a�a�.a�tire?  Say it ain�t so Joe! You mean to tell me that the engine is so small that a tire fits under the hood?&quot;  <i>Ding, ding, ding, congratulations Joel, you just purchased a Subaru!</i>

Back to the interior.  The seats are cloth but are not soft to sit on.  So for people like me who have a bony butt, it�s like sitting on fuzzy cardboard.  Everything about the interior seems stiff.  It�s an extremely uncomfortable feeling to be sitting, or driving, in this car.  The power steering seems only half power.  That is stiff as well.  

My biggest pet peeve about this matchbox is the locks.  Ahh, they do drive me absolutely insane, insane, insane.  If you don�t hold the exterior door handle &quot;up &quot;while closing the door, the lock becomes unlocked.  So there is no slamming of the door, or closing the door with your hands full.  No, you have to have a free hand to lock the door every time.  And this goes for every door.  This is a pain in the a$$.  

While driving this car, there are so many rattles and annoying sounds that I feel like I�m listening to an elementary school band.   When you step on the gas, you can actually hear the car take a huge breath and then feel the car strain to move.  The windshield cleaner is also a joke.  When you want cleaner to be dispersed on the windshield, there is just a splat of washer fluid.  No stream or spray, just a splat, like that of a huge bug hitting the windshield on a car that actually goes above walking speed. 

Any mechanical problems?  Oh yes, ohhhh yes.  I won�t name them all, so I�ll just state that I think everything under the hood (except that spare tire) has been replaced, including the engine.  So far no transmission problems though.  That would be because it doesn�t need to do much work, only slow and stop.  

What pains me the most, is that I am still paying off the loan to this thing (small monthly payments with no interest).  Yes, go ahead and call me stupid if you haven�t already.  I deserve it.  And if you think that it all can�t be that bad, you�re wrong, IT IS.  I had less problems with my �89 T-bird of 4 years that had 178K miles on it.  When I junked it last month after I found out the engine had to be replaced, it still ran faster than the Slobaru.  (NOT KIDDING).  

So, to sum up my feelings of this here car, I DESPISE IT! It is cheaply made(duh), the mechanical problems are excessive, it is uncomfortable to ride in, and, what else can I say?, it just plain su<i></i>cks.

Update: I should have pointed out some repairs, as suggested by Skippio, so here are a few off the top of me head:

-The fuel injection was noted as having problems.  The car would hesitate for long periods of time when you would step on the accelerator.  Obviously not good for pulling out into traffic. (never really fixed)
-Problems with the A/C and heat. 
-Alternator replaced within a short period of time..
-Head gasket (shot)
-Constant oil and antifreeze leaks, even after the engine was replaced. (The spot where the car is parked will have to be marked as a &quot;Superfund&quot; site by the EPA.)
-Other problems I can't quite remember.  I'll have to pull out ALL the bills and update again possibly.
