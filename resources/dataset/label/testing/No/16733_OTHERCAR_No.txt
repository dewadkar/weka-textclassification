            Having owned a '97 540i, and experienced all the numerous annoying troubles that a BMW with 81,000 miles will have, we considered a new model as an alternative.   Yes, we would have to trade the 282hp V-8 engine of the 540i for the 225hp inline 6 of a 530i to even begin to afford it, but they're not exactly sluggish even with the 6, so we checked them out.  This review concentrates more on comparing the 530i with the competition than a straight review of the car itself, so for further details please see my review of the 1997 540i.  It is virtually identical except for the engine. 

Unfortunately, after pricing a new 530i with the options that make it desireable to us (premium package, sports pkg, CD changer, automatic transmission), we just couldn't figure out how BMW arrives at their prices.  With sales and luxury tax, it came to a shocking $48,000 even after a hard-to-get BMW discount of about $1000.   Yes, they're built solidly, with lots of engineering.  But this price doesn't even include the wonderful comfort seats or premium stereo! Keep in mind that Honda builds equally long-lasting V-6 Accords for $24,000 or less) Even if we were willing to make do with the too-narrow-for-my-shoulders standard seats and mediocre stereo, it still just didn't make sense.  When compared to the competition, to which it is admittedly superior in many areas, it becomes almost laughable. 

Just what am I getting for a premium of $6,000 to $8,000 over a comparably equipped Lexus GS300?  Better handling and road feel? Yes, much better. But in almost every other category, the Lexus is equal or superior, especially in ride noise, comfort, stereo quality, reliabiliy, and recently I've discovered....resale value.   Apparently the market for higher mileage, out-of-warranty BMW's has sagged, since people are beginning to shy away from temperamental cars that are expensive to fix. Not convinced? Try $1500 for a catalytic converter, and you have two of them!  Ours went out at 77K miles, luckily just inside the 80k mile emissions warranty.  Or a $8,000 transmission(though they do usually last a long time).  $300 for a electric window.  $800 sets of 17" tires that last about a year.  So, as you can see, once the owner starts footing the costs instead of BMW, ownership becomes a lot more expensive.   Though not perfect either, the Lexus rarely breaks.  With economic times not so rosy now, people are beginning to care more about this.  And, for about the same price as a 6 cylinder 5 series, you can actually own a monsterously powerful Lexus GS430.  And if you want better handling, Lexus has dealer installed suspension upgrades available.  Not every driver would agree, but most of us rarely get to use a car at the limits where the BMW's superiority shows up.  

When you compare the 530i to cars like the Audi A6 2.7T, perhaps closest in concept to the 5 series, you'll find that you get more car for your money with the Audi.  First of all, it costs roughly $5,000 less.   You trade off a little handling prowess with the Audi, but it's still no slouch and you get much more power, more modern sheetmetal, an arguably nicer interior, and other advantages.  And so far, A6 resale is suprisingly good.  They do seem to have the same amount of problems as BMW's, from what I'm hearing on the internet.  

More practical selections, if you're more interested in luxury and cost-of-ownership than carving up canyon roads, include the Infiniti I-30, Acura TL type S, and Lincoln LS V-8.  They range from $31,000 to $38000, real-world price. Again, they're not as good, but they do deliver 90% of the car at 60% to 75% of the price.  

You really need to ask yourself if you're buying the BMW for its unique qualities (firm but smooth ride, amazing road connection, built like a tank) or the cache of the little propeller badge.   And trust me, the fun wears off fast when you're taking it to the shop every 6 weeks for something else that has broken.   (in my experience....the following in less than a year:  broken door handle, broken rear electric window, sticky radio and climate buttons, broken coolant level guage, numerous electrical faults, catalytic converter, bad led elements in guage cluster, oil in gasoline condition that fouled plugs that "just happens sometimes for no reason" according to mechanics, tarnished chrome trim, clouded headlight covers, broken headlight aiming device, leak in tailight lens that shorted lights, leaking valve cover gaskets x 2)  Toss in high scheduled maintenance costs, plus the fact that a dealer appointment takes at least 3 weeks here in Atlanta, and it's "houston, we have a problem here"  Nothing catastrophic, but even warrantied and simple problems still require a time-consuming trip to the shop.

The 530i isn't a bad car. In fact, it's a very good one.  It simply isn't worth what you have to pay to obtain one.  One reason why may be inefficient engineering.  I found many items on the BMW we owned that were simply over-engineered.  It seems like they found the most costly and complex way to build the most simple parts.  If you doubt this, just remove the rear view mirror and look at the design of the mounting bracket.  Instead of one part like on my simple pickup truck...which never breaks......there is an assortment of tiny pins that have to be twisted just right to get the mirror mounted back on the car.  And don't get me started on the maze of climate control and radio buttons.  I'm still not sure what all of them do.  

Here are my impressions of what the BMW 5 series does right and does wrong:

Right:
great handling, road feel, and braking.
decent acceleration, smooth engine
well appointed though somewhat dated interior
exceptional safety features and crash tests
great looking design with the right tire/wheel setup

Wrong:
Incredibly overpriced. Would be worth considering for $5,000 less than current price.
overly complex, cluttered interior ergonomics
tilt-wheel does not tilt down far enough
trim items look fine but  are not up to luxury class standards.  Brittle plastic buttons stick and break.
Standard seats are too narrow for anyone with muscles.  I have to sit with one shoulder outside the seat.
Paint quality is good, but not the best.  
This is not a trouble-free ride, folks.
Repairs are expensive, and obtaining them takes so long it is scandalous.  Apparently their mechanics are busy busy busy.  
BMW image is a two-sided coin.  A lot of people will instantly dislike and resent you for driving one.  This is a lot more real than I'd imagined.
My 2001 Tahoe has a smoother, quieter ride than 5 series with 17" wheels, but going with 15" ones gives up a lot of handling and good looks.
stereo is decent, but again, my simple Tahoe has a better one.  Are decent speakers that cost BMW another $150 too much to ask for in a $48,000 car?
In modern suburban and urban life, 90% of this car's life is wasted sitting in lines of traffic during commutes.  Take that out, and there are $30,000 cars that are superior to this one.  
This car is due to be redesigned for 2003.  Prepare for resale value to drop accordingly.  
Be prepared for snotty sales and service at many BMW dealerships.  An "if you have to ask, you can't afford it" mentality still exists.  

For my $48,000, a 1 year old Lexus LS400 and some change would be a better choice.  Even used, it will cost less to own, deliver much faster acceleration, comparable braking, and much better ride comfort, be much more trouble-free, and get you there more comfortably.  I realize some have biases against Japanese cars, and some want the more "sporty" image that the 530i certainly delivers, but you do pay a lot for that priviledge.  

If you must have a German car, the Audi A6 2.7T or even possibly the 4.2 model are beginning to look like a better choice.  My opinion is that they will age better and will look more modern 5 years down the line.  

I learned from owning a BMW that I am not nearly as interested in driving "fun" as I am in having a car that is nice looking, comfortable, trouble-free, worry-free, safe, and relatively anonymous.  Some drivers wouldn't have a car that is anything less than BMW quality "fun", but they either have to give up size(3 series) ,comfort and reliability(older bmw's), or a lot of money to get it.   For $48,000, an owner shouldn't have to give up anything.
