            I recently purchased a 1999 Chevy Malibu and I am not quite sure if I'm happy with the car.  I mean, it is pretty and easy to drive as well as safe and affordable.  It is a terrific vehicle to purchase if you have small children.  I, however, would not recommend it for people who plan to have teenagers or adults riding in the back because of the lack of leg room.  I wouldn't want to take it on any long drives either...forget family vacation.  It's a great car for singles and even for newly weds...just not families with older children.   Teenagers might enjoy it...because of price and the ease of driving it.  A plus for their parents is that they'll be less likely to carry a ton of passengers.  The car also has a medium sized body which is safer in case of a crash.  Depending on your personal preferences this car might be the right one for you.  I think it's just one you have to see first.<br><br>
