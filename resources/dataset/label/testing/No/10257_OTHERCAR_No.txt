            I've been using it for several weeks now. It was a gift of sorts and my first digital camera. I've been using 35mm film cameras for over 20 years.

It is amazingly compact. If small size is very important to you this one may suit you. However, compactness may have come at the expense of battery life and lens quality. They are both quite small. The battery seems to only last about 2 hours under my usage. I try to limit my use of image review and use the flash about 25% of the time. Carry a spare if you can find one. I have not been able to find them for sale.

Despite having 4 mega pixels I found the sharpness of the images at maximum size and quality to lack some sharpness. I discovered this when using it as a proof camera on some portrait work. Details like eyelashes just don't seem to resolve as well as you might hope. This may not matter to you unless you want to print 8x10 or larger.

At it's widest angle zoom setting the lens displays significant barrel distortion at the edges of the frame. This may be common in these type cameras but it is a whole lot more obvious than I'm used to with 35mm zoom lenses. Horizons placed close to the top or bottom of the frame are going to appear quite curved.

The minimum focus distance also seems greater than I would have  expected for a digital camera. I had heard they were typically good for close up work. The spec probably says what it is but I was not impressed. The focal length is also fixed in macro mode.

The Best Shot feature is handy if you're in a hurry and want to get the best combination of settings quickly. There are a large assortment of presets to choose from. The display shows a sample of each type to make selection simple. This would be most helpful for beginners. The ability to create composite shots may be of interest to family travelers but I have not tried it. I just use a tripod and the self timer.

They state very short shutter lag times. Which is true but what good is it if the camera has not acquired focus lock? I have had to learn to wait for the focus indicator to light before pressing the shutter release all the way. Focusing takes a while and does not always work unless the camera is centered on something with clear, distinct contrast. If you don't use Auto Focus you can avoid this but I think most people using a camera of this type will use it. Something to remember and to adjust to.
