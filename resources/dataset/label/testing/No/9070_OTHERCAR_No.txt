            I bought my Kia Sportage convertible 4X2 in July of 1999. I was very excited since this is my first new car. 
I only got to drive it one day before I had it in the shop. I was driving with no back lights!! Whoever put in the alarm forgot to put back a fuse!! So I was out on the highway at 11:00 at night with no rear lights at all!! This of course was not the car makers fault, it was the fault of the dealership but I just needed to vent!!!
There have been so many more times I can't even remember them all now, just recently it was about 12 degrees below zero and a hose broke and all of my antifreeze leaked out, so I had no heat and then the car overheated. Not to mention I had to walk to a pay phone and my still wet hair froze!!
I had only had the car for I think less then a week and the battery died. I had to have a new one put in and now after reading several other epinions on the KIA I have seen that this is not a rare incident, this seems to happen to almost everyone.  I have also read that the new batteries only last for about a year and a half, so lets see as I am writing this in my updated December 2000 version I have about 1 more month until I need a new one, at which time I think I will probably have to buy a new one since most of the cost is not covered by warranty any more!!
I have also been in for numerous check engine lights, which were blamed on the fact that I must have pumped the gas and not tightened the gas cap. 
My alarm has gone off while driving.  I can't even tell you how many problems I have had with the car and I haven't even had it for a year yet.  It is not worth the aggravation!!

Update on April 16:
I have been back to the dealer many more times and the KIA is still not a year old, I have had to have my drivers seat replaced, the frame broke, it would jiggle back and forth and squeak when going over hills. If you have a KIA and are having this problem, as long as it is still under warranty, bring it back in they have to replace it. 

I have had to go back to the dealer because the back window keeps opening on the bottom and flapping in the wind, they told me that I am not replacing the window correctly, hmmm seems like I am doing it exactly as they showed me and I still have to listen to the flapping while on the highway.

I am so unhappy with this car it is unbelievable. If I could trade it in I would, but at the moment I am paying for my upcoming wedding and just don't have the money to put down on another car,(since it is worth so much less then when I bought it, I have to put money down just to cover how much I still owe on it) and when the dealers see the KIA they just roll their eyes.

I even talked to a friend of mine that tows cars and he said KIA's are the one car that they tow the most often, what does that tell you??
DO NOT BUY A KIA!!! 

*****UPDATE December 2000*****

I have had the Sportage for over a year now, and there have been no more trips to the dealership so far. I am just so glad that the car is still under warranty.  The only gripe I have right now is that the automatic only came in 4X2 and if you wanted 4X4 you had to buy a standard, this should be changed in my opinion.  The Sportage is very light and living in Connecticut I have had real problems driving in the snow with it, not to mention it is rear wheel drive, so that really doesn't help matters much.

******UPDATE March 2002******

Ok now my warantee is almost up and I just had it in the shop twice in the past two weeks.  The first time I was driving it and I could hear a dragging sound in the rear, my husband checked it out and said he could really only notice that the muffler had started to rust out...geez
So I dropped it off at the shop and they replaced the Muffler and said the noise I heard was the bumper, It was loose so they tightened it.
Then that same weekend I was driving on the highway going about 65 and all of a sudden the car jerked and then I took my foot off of the gas and just then the engine revved (with my foot off of the gas) and the RPM's went from 3 straight to 5.  I brought it in and of course they could find nothing wrong with it...could this be because my warantee is up in about 3000 miles?? Probably!!!
My husband recently went to our local Saturn dealership to purchase a used truck and the sales girl there said I might as well just drive the KIA into the ground since I will never get out from under my car payments, since the dealership will give me pretty much nothing for the car now, and no one will buy it second hand...Im pretty much stuck with it!
