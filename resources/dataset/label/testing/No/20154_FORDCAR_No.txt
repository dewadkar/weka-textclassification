            A friend of mine just paid more than $20,000 to try to get the comfort I have in a van almost ten years older and $13,000 cheaper. We have a 1990 model Ford Aero-Star.  This van is awesome and most comfortable. The Windstar has much less head room than the Aero-Star. It is much easier to get in and out of the older van than the new one.  Even with the so called upgrades Ford has established in their newer vans it is apparent they cut too many corners in developing the Windstar.   Our Aero-Star was modified by Qualico with more plush seats, and interior courtesy lights for each passenger.  Even so, the Aero-Star vans that I have traveled in that are just off the production line are hands down better than the Windstar. Aero-Star were available with four-wheel drive.  This is not an option with the Windstar. If you only have town driving to contend with and real comfort isn't an issue buy yourself a Windstar.  If you are looking for comfort and  a more road compatible vehicle buy yourself a used Aero-Star.<br><br>
