            I bought this car for it's nice look the way it drove and the v-6
&gt; I bought a 1998 Chevy Malibu 12 months ago I thought I would love the car
&gt; and I did at first. Let me start out when I first got the car after seven
&gt; months I had to take it back to the dealer the ABS light came on
&gt; along with
&gt; the Break light twice and the Cruise Control button would not
&gt; stay in place
&gt; on the steering wheel, Some times when you would turn on the AC the
&gt; Compressor would lock on and off by it self while the AC Light
&gt; Flashes.  The
&gt; car was still under Warranty when I bought it, after they fixed those
&gt; problems a few days later the driver side window would not go down at the
&gt; same time the Windshield washer light would come on so back to the dealer
&gt; again I get my car back they told me they fixed the problems well the next
&gt; morning the window would not go down and the Washer Fluid light
&gt; came back on
&gt; and at the same time the Battery was leaking Acid back to the
&gt; dealer we went
&gt; got the problems fixed ok February comes around the car is making this
&gt; ticking nose and there is oil in the car  and the Cooling System light is
&gt; flashing back to the dealer again get that problem fixed then at
&gt; the end of
&gt; Feb I had to get new breaks this car is a lemon ok got that fixed ok March
&gt; comes around all of my Break Light went out at the same time the Service
&gt; Engine soon light was flashing I needed a New fuel Injection
&gt; System for the
&gt; break light there was a burned fuse under the Dashboard the left a right
&gt; taillight had burned spots. Needs less to say Chevy need to put this car
&gt; together right are don't sale it at all. There is not a thing I like about this car anymore.
