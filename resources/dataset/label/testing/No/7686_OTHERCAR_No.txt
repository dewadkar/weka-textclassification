            A friend of mine bought a blue Volvo S60 this summer.  I have not driven his car, but have spent some time in the passenger seat, and here are my impressions. 

The S60 on paper
A front wheel drive 4 door sedan, the S60 leans toward the sporty side of the entry level luxury sedan market.  It's new for the 2001 model year, and available with 3 engine options - the normally aspirated 168hp inline 5, the 197hp turbo and the 247hp intercooled T5.

The S60 dimensions and specification look very similar to other cars in this class, but it is tops in front legroom.  Price and standard features are comparable with most competitors

Styling
The S60 has a stylish exterior, with sharper angles than most of the sport-luxury sedans.  Those who liked the Volvo boxiness are in for a disappointment, but I think there will be more people that will like the new look than those who miss the old look of Volvos.  This car takes some cues from the bigger S80, but looks leaner and sleeker.  The tail end of the car with the wide round body blending up to the sharp angled trunk allows for an eye catching tail light section.  With the blue metallic paint, this car ranks among the top 3 vehicles in the class in this category.  

The dark grey interior could use a little more warmth, but matches well with its angular exterior.  No wood or metal trim here. Craftsmanship and attention to detail are top notch.

Comfort 
Ample room inside for four adults.  Little tight for 3 in the back seat.  Nice headroom front and back.  Legroom a little tight in the back for taller people with the front seat adjusted for the 6' 2" 36" inseam driver.  

CD/Stereo on center console is angled nicely toward the driver.  Audio as good as they come from the factory.  Useful slots and plenty of storage space all around .  

The optional leather seats feel really nice, but the power seat for the passenger is an option which did not come on his car.  It's a good thing he isn't married, wives would certainly feel slighted if you pass up on this option.  

Climate controls with dual zones are non regulating, but the pillar mounted vents are a nice touch for rear passengers.

Performance

The 168 horsepower 5 cyl. mated to a 5 speed automatic makes car a little slow off the line.  Once up to cruising speed, seems to have enough power for aggressive driving. The car seems to like high speed cruising, and seems the equal of the best teutonics in this role.  

The suspension seems pretty stiff, but the ride over bumps are not choppy.  High speed and low speed behavior implies a highly rigid chassis.

My friend seems to think himself the equal of racing drivers, driving this car rather recklessly.  Which makes me thankful for the brakes on this car.  Stopping power must rank among the tops in this class.  Some nose dive under heavy braking, probably more than other sports sedans.

In a few more months, after the new car smell wears off,  I will ask to drive the car so I can give a more direct review.  

Odds and ends
His car will automatically turn the fan inside the car, presumably to vent the hot air.  While that's nice, he is concerned about draining the battery, especially with the hot summers around here.  

Summary
The S60 is an appealing replacement to the S70.  The problem is that other cars in this market segment are also excellent cars.  The Mercedes Benz C240, BMW 325i, Audi's A4, and  Acura's 3.2 TL are all worthy competition for this car, and only BMW and Mercedes cost more.  Although it's an easier sell than the S70, Volvo salespeople will have their hands full.  My opinions may change after a drive in this car, but to my friends, I would recommend something else.
