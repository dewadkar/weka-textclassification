            The Polaroid PDC 300 is little more then a very pricey toy with poor images unless you are very close to your subject and you can't enlarge the photo with out it distorting it. The soft ware that comes with it is good and you can use it with other pictures from other sources. you can manipulate your photos in many different ways and even place the heads of people into many different fantasy characters. the soft ware is very easy to use and it prompts you through all the steps of the program. the PDC 300 comes with every thing you need to set it up to run, but you better buy a lot of batteries because it needs a lot of power and rechargeable are not strong enough to make it work like it should. You can buy a power pack from IGO.com that works real well with it and you get 500 photos with flash before you need to recharge it and it sells for about 45.00 with shipping. I don't recommend this camera to anyone! I do recommend the power pack very much!<br><br>
