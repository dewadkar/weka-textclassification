                 My wife and I bought a 98 Kia Sportage because it was a cheap SUV.  We have three young kids and thought it would be enough room, until we actually tried to go on vacation.  After trying to pack the box on wheels we decided to rent a minivan (which we should have bought to begin with). 

     The Kia is too small of a vehicle for anyone unless you are single and plan on staying that way.  It has automatic windows in which none of them roll up at the same speed.  The back spare wheel that shuts over the back door doesn't close very well either.  

     Other problems that have occurred, which I have heard other people mention also are that the stick shift on a standard pops out into neutral while driving down the road.  Another thing is that it will stall while sitting at a red light. Both of these occur fairly often which seems to us to be dangerous.

     I would not recommend a Kia Sportage to anyone who values their life or the lives around them.<br><br>
