            Man, i have always disliked chevys. They ride rough, they arent stylish, and usually behind the times.  But I thought they were reilable.  

NOPE, not a chevy desil.  This truck has a 6.5 turbo on it, and it sucks.  We bought it for a work truck, and we do more work on it than it does for us.  It has like the 6th clutch in it, the tranny sucks, and every few weeks something goes wrong with one or another electrical componets.  The worst part is that every time something fails, the chevy dealer just says, "i dunno, just replace the part."  to bad the same things keep happening over and over.  

Now get a load of this.  For awile, every 10 starts or so the truck wouldnt start. You would have to wait 10 minutes and then try again.  About a week later, while sitting in front of our 100,000 home, the truck, which was in gear with the parking break off, decides to start by itself.  although the engine didnt start (thank god) the starter rolled the truck right into the house, damaging the garage door.  Thinking quickly, my father went outside and disconnected the battery cable.  When we took it to a chevy dealer, they said,"I dunno, i guess its a short.  Once again one of the electrical componets died,m and shorted.  Replace the part. SUre, untill next time, when a kids in front of it.  

Terrible milage, 80 mph top speed.  Once again chevy proves they are overatted
