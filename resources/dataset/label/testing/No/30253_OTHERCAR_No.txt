            WARNING To anyone thinking of buying this Digital Camera, offering &quot;VGA (640 x 480 pixels) image resolution with Agfa PhotoGenie� technology&quot; (quote taken from AGFA's web page for this monster, the URL is:

http://www.agfahome.com/product/FAQ_ListPublic.html?object=FAQ&amp;id=3150

**TAKE NOTE** -- this camera does NOT have a true 640 x 480 resolution -- which probably explains why it has such CRUMMY reviews on this (and other) web sites.

Direct quote from Agfa's Q&amp;A on the above web site:

&quot;Q:� What is the resolution of the ePhoto Smile digital camera?
A:� The ePhoto Smile features 640 x 480 pixel image resolution with Agfa PhotoGenie� technology.&quot;

And, even worse...from the same web page...

&quot;PhotoGenie optimizes the image quality of pictures captured in the camera's highest resolution mode, producing images with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. This is a higher resolution than normally possible using the camera's 130,000 pixel CCD sensor&quot;

Do the math - 640 x 480 resolution requires a CCD with no less than  307,200 pixels. The paltry 130 thousand pixel CCD installed in this beastly camera offers a *TRUE* resolution LESS than even 640 x 240 (which would require  153,600 pixels in the CCD).

They pawn off some cheap software to interpolate and smooth the JPEG image as an excuse for calling a &quot;low quality&quot; image a &quot;high quality&quot; image. Kinda like Intel saying, &quot;here is our Pentium-2000 'mhz' &quot; chip (that actually runs at 1000 'real' mhz :-)

Absolutely insane.

SO: in closing. I don't own this camera. I nearly bought one today through an auction at Ebay. Very close call. If you want an inexpensive digital camera, KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING

-if you want a CHEAP Low-Res digital camera (320 x 240) that doesn't tell lies, get yourself a &quot;JamCam Jr&quot; - available for a net cost of $10 USD plus shipping from places like &quot;Dragon.CA&quot; (URL is

http://www.dragon.ca/games/accessories/jamcamjr.htm )

(btw, no affiliation with dragon.ca other than as a satisfied customer :-)

-Alternately, if you want a DECENT &quot;Inexpensive&quot; Digital camera that takes *real* 640x480 images, get yourself the &quot;Dimera 3500&quot; (which even has a removable memory cartridge that can be upgraded) - for a cost of approx $100 USD.

However: Don't let these lies that AGFA tell fool you!! AVOID THIS CAMERA !!<br><br>
