            I owned a 1993 Lumina Z-24 in torch red for 8 years before trading it in last year for an S-10 ZR-2.  When I first had the car, I loved everything about it.  It was my first new car, however, so much of my vision was clouded.  It actually was pretty nice for the first 40,000 miles.  The problems started coming soon after though.  Small problems aside, the first major problem was a bad valve knock.  I needed to have the top end of the motor rebuilt to fix it.  About 7,000 miles later, the timing belt went.  This was costly and a major inconvenience as it is a fairly big job with this engine.  Upon further research on this issue, I found that this is very common at this milage to replace the timing belt.  The alternator went twice in the 65,000 miles I owned the car.
     As far as driving and performance is concerned, this car pulls.  If you are doing around 30 and put your foot down on the pedal, the engine revs up to it's 7,000 rpm redline and catapults you quickly ahead.  0-60 is another story.  The car is a bit sluggish off the line and doesn't really do much of anything until the tachometer needle hits into the 5,000 rpm range.  The steering was tight, but lacked road feedback.  It was plagued by the same thing many front-wheel drive cars are prone to... torque steer.  Even a semi-windy road is a bit of an adventure to conquer at an acceptable speed.
     The interior is roomy and has enough room for 4 adults comfortably.  The front seats are wrap-around buckets that offer good support for long road trips.  The dashboard is well laid out albeit plain and boring.  Trunk space is great with ample depth.  The exterior is clean, but aggressive.  The car still got looks up to the day I traded it in.  
     Final Word: If you are looking to purchase the Z-34, make sure it's had it's major service done.  $3,500 to $4,500 should bag you a Z-34 in good shape.
