            Our family car for the past six years has been a 1990 Nissan Sentra.  The car was purchased based largely on the fact that I had heard Sentras were dependable as well as economical cars.  This car was purchased at a dealership gently used.  The car ran perfectly for approximately 90 days.  after that, things just started &quot;falling off&quot;, mostly on the passenger side.  The window crank broke off, and now rests in the door arm rest in case anyone wants to open the window.  The passenger side sun visor also fell off, as well as the door-side speaker cover.  The glove compartment takes to spontaneously popping open from time to time.  There's a huge crack in the dash board, and the pulley which reclines the passenger side seat has torn off.  The lights on the passenger side also kept popping, forcing us to buy new ones, and then the cover broke off.  We have had continual problems with the rear lights as well.  It has been in the shop more times than I can remember to have the clutch repaired and the brakes tightened.  The wires to connect the radio have all burnt out, and the air conditioning doesn't work.  My family and I are by all means not rough on this car.  We have no young children who have abused this car.  We do not off road, or take excessively long and frequent road trips.  I know all of this sounds extreme.  I was amazed myself considering the amount of people who have told us how much they love their Nissan Sentras.  Some owners have told us it may have been the fault of the dealership.  However, we have another friend who bought the exact same car at a different dealership &quot;gently used&quot; and has similar problems.  I have also been informed recently that our mistake was buying the car used, and not new.  But, sometimes buying a car new just isn't practical.  If you can't trust the car after it has been &quot;gently used&quot; why buy it new?<br><br>
