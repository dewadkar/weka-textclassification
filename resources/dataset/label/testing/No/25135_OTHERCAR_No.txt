            <b>UPDATE</b>

After a year or so of use, I found that there is a shoddy design in the camera.  The switch on the back of the camera, which changes the LCD screen from taking pictures to viewing the picture taken, fell off the camera, and almost rendered it useless.  I was able to use a pen, and switch between the two, but eventually, the little switch inside the camera came out, and I had to get the camera repaired.  

In the future, I would not buy any camera that had a switch like that, instead choosing something that did not appear as if it would fall off (perhaps a button or something). 

I would not buy this camera because of this problem, and instead choose a newer Canon Digital Elph.  However, please continue and read the review, as it still covers the good features of the Digital Elph by Canon.

<b>Original Review</b>

After much soul searching, and many hours spent on the net trying to find the best deal, I came to and purchased the Canon Digital Elph S-110.  It was quite a purchase at $400, plus extra for all the extra's (more memory, another battery).  And trust me, you will need these extra items.  Now on to the review.

<b>Camera Quality</b>

I am in no way a professional photographer, and barely an enthusiast.  I'm just a guy that wanted to be able to take pictures of anything, anytime, and download them into my computer.  After taking a few dozen pictures, I've found that the camera does well in some situations, and not-so-well in others.  

If you're into getting that action shot, you've gotta be right on to get the picture, or you'll miss it.  The shutter time is 1/1500, which, amazingly, is slow compared to most camera's.  It's still fast, don't get me wrong, but this camera is best used for shots where there isn't a whole lot of action.

The movie mode works great, catching sound and the image in fairly good quality for a digital camera.  It is no video camera, but it holds it's own.  With 8MB of memory, you can get about 30 seconds at the lowest quality.  This is why I suggest getting more memory (I purchased 128MB for $62).

<b> Size </b>

This was quite the selling point on me.  It is so small, it fits in your hand quite nicely, and can be hidden from view with ease.  A friend of mine has one of those giant Sony's with the large lens, and it just seems quite hard to take around, whereas you can pocket this camera and take it anywhere without someone thinking you're a photographer (unless that's what you want).



<b>Bad Points</b>

The camera doesn't last that long...between 60-85 minutes.  When you think about it, you probably only use the camera for one minute for each shot, but then, that's only 85 shots at most, if that.  When some camera's can go 300 shots, it just doesn't stack up.  The recharge time is between 1.5-2 hours, so if you're on the move quite a bit, I suggest another battery be purchased.

The zoom could be improved, and it was on the S-300, but I wouldn't wanna pay another $100-$150 for simply zoom.  I'm not always trying to get long distance shots, so the zoom problem isn't a big deal to me, but it may be a selling point for you.

The included memory could be a bit more than 8MB...it just doesn't cut it, and it's like they want you to buy more memory (well, the probably do).  I'd go for 128 right off, since it's so cheap right now to get memory.  But after paying $380  for this camera, you might not be able to afford it, so get what you can.

<B>Final Thoughts</b>

This is the smallest camera on the market, and they fit a lot into this mini-dig.  It trades some things like battery life and zoom for the small size and good looks.  If you're just into having a good looking camera that has above average quality in pictures and video, then pick this little piece up.
