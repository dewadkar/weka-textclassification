            Other than uncomfortable seats and the quality issues listed below, the car is not bad for what it is. It handles solidly as you would expect and has decent power for what it is. 

The major problem I have with this car is that the front wheel bearings failed at 60,000 miles. As an automotive engineer, I am in a position to know that this is completely unacceptable by today's standards. A wheel bearing is one of the simplest and cheapest components of the drivetrain and the technology has existed for decades to make a bearing last for a quarter of a million miles or more. Of course, the front wheel bearing is not considered part of the "powertrain"(explain that one to me) and so is not covered under warranty. I was fortunate in that I was able to replace it myself and avoid the $600+ dealer bill. Due to the specialized equipment required, this is not a viable option for most people. I had no success dealing with Volkswagen, even though this was clearly a design flaw or product defect. For this reason, I certainly wouldn't recommend a Jetta or buy one again. 

Other annoyances include a spark plug change interval of only 20,000 miles(!), multiple rattles and squeaks, and sub-par gas mileage for its class. If it weren't for the wheel bearing problem(which has also affected a friend's Jetta at 35000 miles), I would be reasonably happy with this car. 

UPDATE 7/17/01:

The downpipe (between the exhaust manifold and catalyst) broke at 66000 miles. Dealer estimate to repair was $720+! Ridiculous. Also not covered under warranty although the catalyst is. Broken motor mount probably led to the failure. New mounts are $200+, not including labor. I still think it's a good car in general, I just wish I hadn't had to do over $2000 worth of repairs on a 3 year old car! 

Perhaps this is the legacy of Mr. Lopez, who brought GM's "buy the cheapest part available regardless of quality" policy to VW?
