            I wrote a summary of my new car almost immediately after I purchased it.  I am still happy with the car, don't get me wrong, but after going for Mitsubishi's 0-0-0 'til '01 event, here I am with BMW-size payments for a Mitsubishi car.  It really hurt the wallet when those payments kicked in last February.  So I say to myself, let's trade this car in now while it's still relatively new, get a good deal on it and find another car that doesn't give me chest pains when I write out a monthly car payment.
So I shop around, finally settle on a new car and have the dealer take a look at my Eclipse.  He comes back in, tells me what a beautiful car it is and then proceeds to look up the Blue Book value.  $15.7k!  My car went from $24.5k new to $15.7k after one year and two months.
After the dealer picked me up off the floor, I resolved never again to purchase a Mitsubishi.  With hundreds of recalls, scandals all throughout the company and with depreciation rates like that, I would be a darn fool to even step into another Mitsubishi dealer.
Word to the wise, don't buy a car the first year it's released.  Wait one year and check the depreciation rate.  You'll thank me in the end.
