            I bought this camera as a first time digital camera user. I got it on sale for $300. I loved the camera until I realized how fast it drained the batteries and how much the AC adapter was priced at. I tried using rechargeable batteries but the camera would not take them. I do not recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't want to eat through batteries. The photo quality is great and it is very user friendly. The software is a little slow. Like I said before, the camera is great but unless you want to eat through batteries or spend $60 for the AC adapter this camera is not for you.<br><br>
