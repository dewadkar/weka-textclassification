            I bought the vehicle because the Dodge Dealership was close and offering a liberal trade-in and factory incentive of $3000.00 total.  Two months after I bought the vehicle, the dealership was closed down by Daimler Chrysler and all the promises I got about great service and free loaner cars went out the window.  The Dealer was SHUT DOWN by D-C and all his vehicles were loaded on a car carrier and taken away.  I purchased this car on 3/15/99 and I learned the meaning of "Beware the Ides of March". Now I had to be at the mercy of a nearby Chrysler/Plymouth dealer who did not sell me this car.

I hated how much this vehicle was in the repair shop for numerous complaints on the doors, windows and brakes. Lots of problems with doors, windows, (excessive wind noise), power door motor broke, mechanism in door locking mechanism broke, brake rotors warped twice.. once at 7K and again at 12K and to top it all off, water would collect in door sills of the car and either freeze in winter or come pouring out after opening door after rain.  The engine never ran smooth either, there was always some type of vibration at idle, when it was in park with the engine running.  Sitting at a light caused the car to shake... naturally, no one could find anything wrong with it, a re-program of some main computer helped a small bit, but didn't eliminate the problem.  Also, in the spring of 2000 I turned on my A/C and all it did was blow hot air.  All of the freon leaked out according to the service department.  They put in some "ultra-violet" dye inside of the system to see if they could tell where it was leaking out... I was not happy. 

It is okay to drive the car, it always started, but the annoying aspects  and disappointment of always having it in the shop for stupid numerous repairs was a bummer.  The van pool driver Fritz at Rockland Auto Plaza in Nanuet, NY didn't even need me to tell him where my job was, he knew the route by heart.

I don't think anyone should buy this vehicle, it is poorly designed and Chrysler doesn't stand behind their product.  They ignored my complaints and National Dispute Settlement Center in Texas claimed to not be able to assist me- because in their estimation my car's problems didn't not effect the value or safety of the vehicle.  Chrysler has a regional office only 5 miles away from where my Arbitration Hearing was held and they didn't even dignify me by sending a factory representative to be present.  I gave Daimler-Chrysler the opportunity to buy this Lemon off of me and put it in a rental fleet, sell it to a driving school or use it for crash testing and they didn't take me up on the offer.  Sadly,
it is sitting in the parking lot of a Toyota Dealer and has the price tag of $9995 on the window.  This car isn't worth .50 cents in my opinion.  If they let people test drive it.. and then get in a Toyota.. they will sell tons of new Toyotas.

My Neon got traded in at 14K when it was 16 months old.  I don't miss it.. I love my new Toyota 2001 Corolla.

Update- Early 2001 someone registered this vehicle in the vicinity of Mineola, Long Island- NY.  God, do I feel sorry for this poor person or persons who owns it.  I ran a CarFax report and saw that is was recently re-registered and the folks even have a lien on this car... They are going to be so mad... I hate the fact that this happened to some innocent victim... but I hope they give Chrysler more misery than I ever did.  ;-)
