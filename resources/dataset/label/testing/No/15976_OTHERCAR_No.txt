            We purchased this vehicle after having owned three previous Mercedes: 1978 450SEL, 1978 450SLC and a 1989 300 SE.

We have lived a nightmare since we purchased the 1994 S320, as follows:
1. The rear windows have never worked- we have spent nearly $1000 and they still break every thrird of fourth time they are put down. The factory solution is take out the fuses so they are inoperable.
2. The car has leaked oil since about 32,000 miles. We have spent nearly $1500 replacing gaskets and the car still smokes and smells like an old truck
3. Many of the critical parts are made of platic. We have had repeated failures and at 133,000 miles we have replaced nearly every part on the car save the block, transmission and drive train.
4. The door sealing mechanism and door locks quit working at about 45,000 miles and have not worked since. We have dropped nearly $1,000 into trying to obtain repairs and todate  the car has been in the shop for nearly a month and the problems persist.
5. We have taken the car to three different Mercedes dealerships Hoen Mercedes in Carlsbad CA, Phoenix Motors in Phoenix AZ and Escondido Mercedes in Escondido CA and found them all dishonest and imcompentent---particularly Phoenix Motors

The car is consistently broken or some mechanism has failed and is a nightmare to own and operate

I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone who does not want to suffer extreme abuse and disappointment---the the old concenpt of a well enginered luxury car is a myth--- this car is not mechanically sound<br><br>
