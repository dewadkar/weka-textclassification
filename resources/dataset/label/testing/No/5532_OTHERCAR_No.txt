            We have been leasing a 97 Chevy Tahoe for almost three years now. My husband and I did a lot of research before we decided to lease this vehicle, but I guess it just wasn't enough. 
The truck was used slightly..had about 15,000 miles on it. It was a plush car, and I fell in love right away. We have a family of five, and I wanted something roomy for our family, and our gear...camping..stroller..whatever. My husband wanted luxury..which this car has..leather seats, auto everything..just gorgeous inside. But as I learned it is what is under the hood that counts.
We have had nothing but problems with this car since the date of purchase. Within the first few months the repairs started coming in. We have had to replace the fuel pump, the water pump, the radiator, the windshield wiper motor, the anti-lock brake system, and as we speak the driver side door will not open. These are repairs that every time we take it in the serviceman says..&quot;gee, this usually doesn't happen on cars til they have over 80,000 miles or so. Right now the car has less than 45,000. And its not like we run it in the ground. I am the main driver, and I work at home all week, so it usually is just used on the weekends for errand type driving. I am actually hesitant to take it on long drives..like the four hours to visit relatives, so I have to get a rental. And the price we are paying is outrageous!! $450 a month for a car that looks great but runs horrible.
