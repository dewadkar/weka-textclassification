            Bought this vehicle new to replace a Ford Thunderbird.  Like the overall roominess of the car.  Dodge won me over because of the sleek design over the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.

The car now has $40K miles on it in six years.  We've had a few major issues:  A/C was replaced, Transmission replaced at 18K (heard this was common), and several oil leaks.  Luckily I bought a 7 year warranty or I would have had to shell out big bucks for these repairs.  The black paint has not held up and is faded in many spots.  When I got the car, the power was great.  Now, it's just adequate.

Lately, the car has been riding pretty well.  It gets very good gas mileage - usually over 25MPG.  It is very spacious and comfortable.  

Will probably be trading it in 2001 for something new.  Probably won't by a Dodge product because Dodge dealers service sucks.  Car manufacturers better learn that good service is what will turn a customer around.  I only have 2 local Dodge dealers and both are lousy.
