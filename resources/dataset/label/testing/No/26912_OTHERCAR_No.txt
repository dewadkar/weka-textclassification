            My husband (then boyfriend) bought this car because he wanted a sporty convertable, but couldn't afford anything really fancy.

I think he now wished he'd spent the same money on something boring and reliable, that wouldn't have given him so many headaches.

The first problem we noticed was that the seat belts don't work well.  They don't retract well and are always loose.  This is true in the front and back.

Then a gaping hole developed where the cloth top meets the glass rear window.  He tried everything to repair this, but nothing works.  SO every time it rains outside, it rains inside the car too.  And the trunk fills up with water, the back carpet is ruined and smells.

The A/C went out, got fixed, went out again, got fixed again, went out again.

The vinyl seat have numerous rips and holes in them.

Then we had endless problems with the battery staying charged.  Maybe it was the alternator, but this took many trips to the garage to finally be fixed.

Now the convertable top won't go up and down.  It has a fancy electic motor that puts it up and down, and the motor totally broke, and there is no manual way to put it down.  So our convertable doesn't convert.

I don't know if this is normal for this car, or if we just got unlucky.  But all I can say is that based on our experience, avoid this car.
