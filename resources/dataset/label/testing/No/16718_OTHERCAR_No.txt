            Like many others, I really enjoy my Peugeot. It is a pleasure to drive- it has great road feel (the steering is very tight- not overboosted like my wife's Celica), the brakes are pretty good, and you can rev it to redline frequently without harming the engine. When you hit 4,000 RPM it just goes, and the engine screams right up to 7,000. Of course, the tradeoff is that, at a peak torque of just 128 foot pounds, it's a bit sluggish off the line. There's just no thrust without revs.

The seats, both front and rear, show why the Europeans make the most comfortable cars in the world. Japanese seats are okay, but nothing more. Americans can't make a comfortable but firm seat with good support- they still don't get automotive ergonomics. Isn't 100 years of manufacturing and design enough? The Big 2 need to hire Italians to design their cars' interiors.

The downside of this car is what did Peugeot in in the U.S. A Peugeot is the tow truck's best friend. I should know- I towed lots of Peugeots when I drove a tow truck. They have electrical problems which even an experienced Peug. tech can't fix. The auto. transmissions were garbage. Mine has 77,000 miles on it, and all kinds of electrical gremlins. The suspension creaks like an old rocking chair. This car is pretty much worn out, yet is a low-mileage vehicle. I would only recommend one to a mechanic or another tow truck driver.<br><br>
