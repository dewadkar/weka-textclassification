            This is just a basic review to outline the main differences between the new S110 which Canon has recently released onto the market.  Here are the main features which set the two apart.  I am writing this because I am in photo/electronic sales and whenever I go to other stores I have being told quite a few features which aren't true.  Here is the lowdown...

*Improvements made in the S110 over the S100:*

-You have the ability to choose between an ISO setting of 100,200,and 400 on the S110, with the S100 you are limited to a ISO setting of 100.  What this basically means is that you have a camera that is a little more versatile and can be used in lower light shooting situations.  Of course, you lose a bit in the way of image quality when shooting at higher ISO's but this will allow the shot to actually turn out whereas in some situations it wouldn't have turned out shooting it with the S100.

-5x digital zoom (S110) vs. 4x digital zoom.  When looking at the numbers there isn't a huge difference in the digital zoom ability, but the main differences is that the S110 has a seamless 5x digital zoom, when using the S100 you'll zoom in as close as you can optically (2x) and then the camera will jump to the 2x digital zoom, and then jump to the 4x digital zoom.  There is no in-between here.

-The ability to record short mpeg movies.  Granted, I don't know many people that take advantage of this feature on the S110 but I can see where it might be useful at times.  On an 8 megabyte card you are limited to approximately a short 30second movie which is recorded at a 640x480 resolution.  Note: They can also be recorded at 320x240, and 160x120 all at approximately 20 frames per second with sound (mono)

-A few more different picture size options.  With the S100, you can have your pictures taken at 640x480, 1200x1600 fine, and 1200x1600 superfine.  With the S110 you have three main different sizes along with three different compression levels.  This gives you a lot more control as to what level you'd like to save your picture as.  The three resolutions are 1200x1600, 1024x768, and 640x480.  Along with these three different resolutions you have the choice of saving them at three different levels of compression, those being: normal, fine, and superfine.  Depending on what combination of resolution and compression you can save anywhere from 87 to 7 pictures on an 8megabyte card.

-The software that comes with the S100 is pretty much similar to the software that comes with the S110 so I wouldn't even bother letting the software be a deciding factor between the two. HOWEVER, I should let you know that the S110 IS compatible with Canons Card Photo Printer (the CP-10) whereas the S100 IS NOT compatible with this piece of equipment.  Again, depending on how much you are willing to spend on optional accessories this may or may not be relevant to your purchase decision.

-Both cameras come with a wrist strap, battery charger (yes they use the same battery), 8 megaybyte compact flash card, a USB cable, AV cable, as well as their designated software packages.  

For the most part, the extra 100 bucks that the S110 is well worth the extra features that you get.  I myself have an S100 and am quite happy with it, and if I had the money I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade to a Canon G1, or if I were to take smaller steps up the digital camera ladder, and S110, or an S300.  Both the S110, and S100 take pictures at exactly the same maximum resolution so image quality shouldn't affect your decision too much ( how much control over the size of the file might play a factor ).

I hope that this review has been helpful and if there is anything that I should add to this review please e-mail me at cmc@ualberta.ca and I will get back to you asap. Thanks for taking the time to read this !

Cheers,
