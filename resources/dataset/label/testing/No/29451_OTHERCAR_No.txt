            I've heard a surprising number of people say they purchased their SUV for their dog, and I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm one of them.  About eight months ago, I became the proud owner of a German Shepherd puppy, and needless to say I knew immediately she would NOT look good in my wimpy VW Cabrio.  Only a Jeep would do!  I commute from San Francisco to Palo Alto (about an hour each way) with my dog, and the good news is, the dog LOVES the Jeep.  With the backseat out, there is a huge area in back for storage, luggage, the dog bed, etc.

The bad news is, I HATE the Jeep with a passion.  This is NOT a commute vehicle, unless you like to ride to work in a bumper car every day.  The ride is extremely uncomfortable, at speeds above 65 you can't carry on a conversation, much less talk on a cell phone, and you have to blare the radio to be able to distinguish which song is on, even with the speakers on the roll bar.  In addition, its difficult to get in and out of the jeep in a long skirt or dress (even with the side step).  The windows on my jeep zip and I've had many near misses on the freeway trying to zip the windows when it suddenly gets too cold. 

Also, this thing goes through gas like water.  I'm spending triple the amount per week on gas. 

On the weekends, I do enjoy driving it around the city, or on short trips to the mountains, etc.  There are so many options for getting air/sun:  taking the doors out, putting the top down, taking the rear panels out.  Its a great recreational vehicle.  However, its not well insulated.  The heater works very well, though.

With the increased popularity of SUVs, it was easy for me to be lulled by the salesman into thinking the improvements over the last few years make this vehicle an option for my lifestyle and commute.  This was clearly a mistake!  <br><br>
