            I purchased a Chevy Blazer in August of 1999.  During that time the vehicle has been towed to the shop three times and I have a total of approx. 7,000 miles.  My first time they replaced the fuel filter and cleaned the fuel injectors.  They then told me that there is a lot of bad gas being sold and that Mobile was the best to purchase.  I tried to purchase mobile when I could but it didn't make a difference in the fuel injectors fouling.  I went approx. 2,000 miles until they fouled again and the vehicle was towed in again.  They advised me of the same reasoning and cleaned the injectors again and I took the vehicle.  And, the third time I had approx. 7,000  always have and still purchase gas from the major gas miles on it and the same thing happens and its towed in again. I am now dealing with the sales manager on how we are going to resolve this problem.  He states that a lot of this is happening with the Blazer.  Overall I really enjoy the vehicle and I like the way it runs when it is running.  Just beware of the fuel injectors and talk it over with the dealership before you purchase a 1999 Blazer.<br><br>
