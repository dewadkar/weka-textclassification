            I bought a new 2000 ML320 on 7/00. Being my first SUV and Mercedes Benz I've been very disappointed! I've had many problems with my ML320: faulty window switches,whining sound from fuel tank area, faulty air bag and  wiring, broken glove box, faulty brake light switch, rear seat upolstery,clock very difficult to set, kick panel on passenger side that fell down constantly, engine quit at 60 mph,and lately I've been having strange braking  sounds 
(a cracking noise )...they recently lubricated the torsion bar bushings...however it still appears to be making noise...it sounds like cracking from the chassis ....I'm off to the shop again this week...I estimate I've been to the dealer about nine times...I've had the car 16 monthes!!
I also had to replace the brakes at about 25 k miles...the car has 30k on it...this I can live with!


On top of all this I can say the service I get is not what I expected when I bought a Merceded Benz. I do get a loaner each time I've  brought my car in and everything has been under warranty but the service people both locally and national are as good as a Hyundai dealer! There was a national back order on  my window switch (not what I expected with a luxury car manufacturer) and only after several calls  between my local dealer and national MBUSA did I finally get it remidied. Lately I've been thinking ...."should I unload my ML320"...."what happens when my warranty expires is what I'm asking myself!?"


Maybe I have a lemon..although I did go to the National Highway and Transportation Safety Board's website and looked up ML 320..and I saw the fuel line problem, and the stalling problem...so there are others with similar problems...My my dealer is also part of the problem...as i'm sure all dealers treat their customers differently...even when they fall under the Benz umbrella!!

I'm looking into a new BMW X5...maybe I'll have better luck...than again I looked up problems with it...radiators over heating and electrical engine fires as a result....
I can honestly say... my $15,900 New Volkswagon Beetle....has been more pleasing then my Benz....it drives like a little sports car, the service is great...only been their once but, they fixed my problem right away...and that monthly payment is a lot easier to swallow!
