            Logitech ClickSmart 310 is a simple and cheap digital webcam-portable camera. I was in the market for a webcam, and the added bonus of being able to take it out and about seemed promising. I came across the 310 for $65. I was impressed with the initial read of the features for this unit.

<b> Quick Specs </b> 

 Built in 2MB SDRAM stores up to 160 photos or 15 seconds of video.

 Still image resolutions of up to 352x288 for digital camera and 640x480 PC webcam.

<b> Install </b>

Open the box. Connect USB cable(supplied) to camera, put batteries(supplied) in the cam, and connect unit to a USB port on your PC. Add the software provided and you are ready to rock! It is simple.

The software provided has a nice array of features. It allows you to make videos, setup a live webcam, make animations, and has a motion detector to name a few.

<b> Webcam </b>

The webcam works like clock work. The camera has automatic focus control and if you need to tweak it, the interface allows some adjustments to color, brightness, and light and darkness. However, when you take pictures to email or make a photo gallery, light in the background must be optimum or forget it. This is a huge flaw with this camera. Too much or too little light makes the pictures look horrible.

I had to bring an extra light into the room to get decent pictures. In a sunlit room, with no artificial light, the camera comes alive. The picture broadcast online and on the desktop were clear and crisp. It is unfortunate that the camera works better only during the day. I prefer it to work in all environments. I would recommend making the proper adjustments with an extra light or two  to get the most from this unit.


<b>On the rode</b>

I made a fast rode trip to Magic Mountain (check out my review) and I took about 90 photos. A downside about the 310 cam is it has a "snap and pray" feature, you cannot view the picture as it is being taken. I took 90 photos, some were up close and others were distant shots of roller coasters. After getting home, I downloaded the shots in record time, less than 30 seconds easy. I was really disappointed in the photos. The distant shots were either out of focus, or slightly washed out. However, some of the close ups were clear and crisp, decent but not awe inspiring. The 310 does not have a manual focus, and it lacks the ability to change the resolution of photos between shots.


This camera will work for you if you want to get online and want people to see you on your website, or on a messenger service. With the right amount of light. However, for nice photos to send your friends and family, I suggest you find greener pastures.

A side note: The software has some sample videos and photos that are spectacular to view. I personally can't believe those examples are an accurate depiction of the ability of this camera. I tried to make photos similar and failed miserably.
