            I HAVE OWNED FOUR PONTIAC BONNEVILLE's SINCE 1994. THE 2000 AND 2001 HAVE
THE BATTERY UNDER BACK SEAT. THESE MODELS ARE A ACID BATH WAITING FOR A ROLLOVER OR A SIDE IMPACT!!! MAYBE THIS IS GM'S SECRET !!! I RECOMMEND
THE NEW CHEVROLET IMPALA. I SHOULD LIST ALL THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH THE PONTIAC BONNEVILLE. WHAT DO THINK OF MISSING PARTS ON SUSPENSION OF NEW 97 NOT FOUND BY DEALER OR FACTORY FOR FOUR MONTHS AND TWO DEALER SERVICE SECTIONS(PARTS TOOK THREE WEEKS TO GET FROM FACTORY) THIS CAR HAS ALSO HAD THE DASH REPLACED AT 26K MILES. NOW WITH 40K MILES IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. THE ENGINE LEAKED OIL FROM DAY ONE. OIL PAN WAS REPLACED
FIRST. THEN THE ENGINE HAD TO BE T0RN DOWN. THE FRONT COVER WOULD NOT ALIGN THE OIL SEAL. MY 95 WAS TROUBLE FREE ALTHOUGH IT WAS TRADED IN AT
23K. ONE OF 94'S HAD TO HAVE A NEW DASH INSTALLED ( BAD GAS GAUGE AND SPEEDOMETER) (NOTE GM DOESN'T INSTALL A NEW DASH ONLY RECONDITIONED ONES.) AND THIS IS FOR ANY GAUGE UNIT FAILURE. MY OTHER 94 HAD TO HAVE MASTER CYLINDER REPLACED 37K MILES. I HAVE KEPT ALL RECORDS FOR THESE FOUR BONNEVILLE'S. I STILL OWN ONE OF 94'S AND THE 97.
