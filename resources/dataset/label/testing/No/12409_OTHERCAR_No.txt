            I bought my wagon on the day after Thanksgiving in November 2001.  I went to the dealership for a bright red GTI and somehow I switched to wanting this dark blue Passat.  It was a great car.  It road like a dream and had plenty of power.  I tested it on the hills of Rt70 near my home. I could not believe it pulled the hills at 90 mph with 3 adults in the car.  It never had to downshift.  It was amazing.  So, with plenty of power and much more interior room then the GTI, I had to have it.  

I have about 18K miles on it as of Oct 2002.  The problems started with it the second day of ownership.  The turn signal stopped working.  When I checked it, the bulb was hanging out of the headlight assembly.  I put it back in and it still did not work.  So I took it back to the dealership the next day and they told me a connector to the lamp was loose.  I thought this to be strange.  Why would a new car have the bulb hanging out and be disconnected in the harness?  Anyway, it was fixed and I was happy.  

Things were OK for a while then the trim pieces along the top of the roof started coming out.  At first, I just pushed the strips back into their slots.  But it got to the point that they would not stay in as I drove to work.  So, I took it to the dealership and they replaced them.  Within a week, the new trim pieces started coming out again.  So I took it back and the dealer put more glue on them.  This also did not help.  All it managed to do is get glue all over the place.  So I took it back for a third time.  The dealer ordered newly designed strips of molding and put them in.  Its been about two weeks now and the new molding is again coming up.  So, I am back to just pressing the strips down as I go to get into the car.  

Another strange thing that has been going on is that when the car is first started, there is a ticking noise in the engine until it warms up.  The dealer told me the sound was OK.  I certainly hope so.  Since I have owned this car, I also had to take it to the dealership to have the engine control module replaced.  The car was stalling when it was cold and the engine light would come on and stay on for 2 days at a time.  The dealer thinks they fixed the stall problem, but just last night, it started sputtering and the engine light began to flash.  After the engine warmed up, the flashing stopped and the car ran fine.  I can imagine that I will be visiting the dealer again as winter approaches to fix this new problem.  

The last known problem I have is that the rear speakers sound horrible.  This car has the Moonsoon system so I expected a lot from the radio.  The front speakers sound great, but the rear ones sound as though there is no high tones.  It is just not right.  However, the dealer told me this is the normal way it works.  I think I need to find a new dealership.  

(The dealer is Fitzgerald Auto Mall in Frederick, Maryland.  Also, while fixing the trim pieces for the third time, they scratched my car.  They fixed it, which is not a problem.  These things happen.  But they denied that they fixed it, or painted it, even though I showed them all the places on the silver window trim that they left the blue overspray.  Not to mention that when I bought the car, I purchased the extended warranty because the were offering a special where they turned a 7 year/100K mile warranty into a 8 year/100K warranty.  Then, 10 months later they told me that my car did not qualify for the extra year.  So they wanted me to sign a new contract for the 7 year version.  I refused, and they did give back the money for that.)
