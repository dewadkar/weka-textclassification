            Let me start by saying this is a rewrite of an epinion I did right after I joined the site. In the months since I have had more time with the car and more time on epinions and have learned what makes a quality car review. And the older version of this one didn't cut it.
 
A few years ago my aunt came into some money. Her first thought, of course, was not to pay off the mortgage or some bills, but to purchase a rolling display of her wealth. I begged her consider a Bimmer or a Benz. I advocated more strongly for the BMW, with its sportier demeanor. So what does she do? She runs out and buys a Jaguar XJ6, and a used one at that,  despite my frequent warnings about the state of the British car industry.

She was trusting enough to let me take it out on my own a few times running errands for her. I was impressed on a superficial but not substantial level.

First, the interior. When it comes to interior styling I don't think any car company does it better than Jaguar did. The use of wood trim and cowhides looks beautiful, and the last word on your mind when you have a look is 'cheap.' It reminds you that you are in a real luxury car, not in a cheap mid sizer with plastic wood trim super glued to the dash to present the image of one. You get a complete set of gauges that give you engine temps, a tack, and pretty much everything else you need to know.
The radio and climate controls are placed a little too low for my taste, and some of the buttons are too small and have symbols on them that are hard to decipher. And there is a cluster of buttons to control various functions on the steering column to the right of the wheel that is just way too  busy.
 
The stereo has great power and loudness but was just a notch down on clarity from what I expected, with just a bit too much distortion.
The seats are very comfy, with good lateral and lumbar support though the headrests are a bit low and they do now support the thighs so well. The continuously variable power adjust allows just about anyone to get comfortable behind the wheel, though it could be better if the controls were on the door armrest instead of the side of the seat, where you cannot see them.

People always call this car's rear seat cramped. I would not go that far but will only say it is not as cavernous as you would expect in a car of this price. Not much better in space than a Camry or Accord. The trunk is also smallish.

This is a heavy car, so though test numbers I've seen indicate it should hit 60 in about 7.5 seconds it doesn't feel that quick. Maybe It's quicker than it feels or not really that fast, I don't know, but it doesn't seem to pull that hard until you're at highway speeds, when you floor it the big in-line 6 downshifts and the car shoots forward very quickly. I have yet to find a 'manumatic' that impresses me, and this car is no exception. The shifter stayed in the automatic side of the J-shaped shift gate most of the time, as the manual mode on the side closest the driver did not give me enough gears to play with.
 
The suspension soaks up the really small bumps that come close together, which I find most annoying, but the really big ones can be jarring. The car's weight takes a toll on handling. It doesn't lean much but the tires give out early in corners. It feels ponderous to me, like it prefers that I point straight ahead and shoot rather than throw it through the curves.

The finish is still as good as ever, with a deep shine and a good resistance to scratches and dings. My aunt has it in burgundy. I have not seen rusting or fading set in yet, though there are the normal battle scars that you might expect on a seven year old car.

And I will finish with this one car's glaring downside. It spends more of its time in the shop than on the road. My aunt usually ends up getting a ride to work in my grandmother's corolla because the Jaguar is in the shop for one reason or another, one time a water pump, another time an exhaust system. The 4.0 in-line 6 sometimes sounds like a truck engine. Be prepared to pay for 93 at the pump and no less, as the high compression engine will ping on anything else. 

Overall, I can't speak to the new Jaguars as I'm not familiar with them but this car seems to be a luxury car only in that it has a leather interior and a high price tag. Other things that should be a part of luxury, such as performance, quality, and reliability, are lacking. Go ahead, spend 50 million hours hand stitching the leather for the seats on each car. But engineering and mechanical development deserves some attention too.

Do I envy my aunt for having a luxury car while I have my little pickup? Absolutely not, as my Ranger has started faithfully every time I turned the key in 63,000 miles of pedal to the metal teenage male driving abuse. Maybe Jaguar's new owners in Dearborn can do it some good.<br><br>
