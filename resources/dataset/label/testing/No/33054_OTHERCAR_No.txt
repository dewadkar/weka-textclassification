            This opinion is about the 1993 Grand we bought (we had owned two prior to that). We had three growing boys and it was great for vacations and hauling. I had it put out of its misery( or mine) this past weekend at 162,700 miles. I could not afford the $1,500 repair bill for the valve job. This was after having it towed twice this month already and paying close to $600 for those repairs-new battery and new ignition system. The entire system came loose-the key got stuck in the ignition and they had to rebuild the steering column.

The electrical system started going haywire about six months after we got it. The door ajar light remained on with the alarms, even though all doors had been closed. Had it fixed once, then it came back on-it remained that way for four years. The radio/cassette had to be replaced within the first year. It quit working about two years ago.  The transmission went at 101,000 miles and was replaced. The air conditioner became non-functional at age 4 years. It has had three starters, three complete brake overhauls, new serpentine belt, driver's seatbelt was frozen, passenger side-temperamental, the sliding door handle pulled off, tie rods, struts, shocks, and other miscellaneous repairs.

However, I was amazed that I never needed a new exhaust system or radiator.

The vinyl portion of the seats were beginning to show signs of wear ( which I considered to be normal, considering the usage.)

In wet, windy, or slippery conditions, this vehicle handled poorly with swaying and slipping(even with good tires). It took two hands to keep it on the road. In dry conditions, I loved it! It has a wide turning radius, making tight manuevering difficult at times.

Even with everything that didn't work.....I wish I could have afforded to keep it......but in my line of work, I need a car that runs.
