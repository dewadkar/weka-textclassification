            First day driving it, ABS light came on and brakes almost completely failed. Dealer just deleted code, does not care. Steering inconsistancies and sudden change in sensitivity while driving. Premature and excessive Tire wear in only several thousand miles. Second day driving it a squeak squeak squeak noise developed when making U-Turns at times. After 1 Tire Shop Alignment and 2 Chrysler Dealership Alignments vehicle will still not drive straight. Steering wheel sometimes feels as if it has a mind of it's own. I have heard a metal against metal noise, rubbing, clunking and a light scraping noise in Steering at times. Suspension sometimes makes loud squeaking. Vehicle will suddenly ride rough when driving. Transmission usually shifts inconsistently, sometimes bumps, stumbles and hesitates. I have had witnesses also drive the vehicle that have also experienced these things. Dealerships and DaimlerChrysler do nothing, play games and do not care. I am frustrated with these problems that occur on and off. There is simply too much to write, please visit my website for a better, more complete description of what I have been through at http://intrepid.clan-510.org. This may help someone else. It's really too bad because it is such a nice car otherwise but unfortunately many seem to have these problems.
