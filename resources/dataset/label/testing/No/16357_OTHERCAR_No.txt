            I bought my HP C200 Photosmart camera in November of 1999 because it had all the qualities I wanted at the cost I could afford.  It worked great, and was easy to use, then I had a problem with it.  In May of 2000 it just wouldn't work one day, after a call to HP they said it had an &quot;internal communication error&quot; and had to be sent in, they would send me a replacement camera.  I sent mine in....  after 2 weeks of not getting another one I called and was told they had lost mine that is why they hadn't yet sent me another one.  They apologized, told me I would get a new camera with a new warranty on it.  What I got was a refurbished product, so I called and was apologized too, sent that one back in and then received my new one in June of 2000.  Now this one again, isn't working.  This time is something wrong with the autoflash causing it not work.  I have called HP again, this time requesting a full refund of my money, 2 cameras in less than a year is not a good sign to me.  I missed my son's preschool graduation and my daughter's first birthday the first time around, and now will be missing my son's first day of kindergarten.  I bought this camera to share important moments with far away family as they happend, and for all these important events I have not been able to do that.  My recommendation would be to buy a different brand of camera, I am not happy at all with HP's service or response time in any of my matters and phone calls to them.<br><br>
