            I bought my 97 Sunfire new to replace my beloved 87 Honda Accord, which I'd driven for 10 years. Mine is a 5-speed SE coupe, but I opted for the larger 2.4 liter engine that comes standard on the GT. I wanted better acceleration than the standard 2.2 liter engine and I got it, though as I expected I paid a price in fuel economy.

The biggest disappointment to me has been the handling - the ride is inferior to my old Honda hatchback, which was only slightly larger. At highway speeds, the car tends to wander a bit, like it's not heavy enough to keep from getting blown around. It's definitely not a quiet car at higher speeds either.

Mechanically, the car has been quite reliable - no major problems. However, there currently is a recall on it for &quot;inadvertent air bag deployment.&quot; Which brings me to safety... the antilock brakes have come in handy a time or two, though sometimes under normal braking I hear a rattle. I saw a TV program a couple years ago with some very sobering crash test data - the Chevy Cavalier (very similar to the Sunfire) does not perform well in side-impact collisions. So overall I don't give this car good marks for safety, and if I had children I'd be even more concerned. 

A few more annoying things... there's not much headroom, and I notice this even as a 5'7&quot; woman. The power sunroof was an option I wanted after enjoying my Honda's pop-top sunroof, but with it open the airflow through the car is so turbulent that I can't keep my hair from blowing into my eyes. So I rarely use it.

And a few little good things... the ashtray/cupholder is a nice feature, though I've sometimes wished it could hold bigger cups. The back seat is roomier than you'd expect in a compact car. The driver's seat has been pretty comfortable even on 1000-mile trips. 

Overall, the car is fairly fun to drive and meets my basic expectations of an economy car with a few sporty features. I'd give it a B, maybe a B-.<br>
