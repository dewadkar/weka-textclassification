            I bought this vehicle because of the no haggle pricing and the reputation I had heard of it.  Well after the warranty ran out and it was paid off I had monthly repairs equal to a  car note.  
The vehicle drives good and the radio I had sounded great.  The pickup was a tad slow, but it was a 4 cylinder.  The steering handled well while driving it also.
I know several people that have replaced alternators in other GM cars, so I do not blame just Saturn for this one.  Next I had to replace the ignition coil the next month.  So I know now not to buy a GM car and I will therefore go with Honda or Nissan.  <br><br>
