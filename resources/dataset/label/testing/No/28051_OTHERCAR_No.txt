            When I rented the 2001 edition of the Impala for a week, my predominant reason was to check out its optional 3.8L engine (base is 3.4L). When I put it to the test on the windy roads of the island of Nassau in the Bahamas, I was not disappointed.

<b>POSITIVES</b>

Performance: Handling is just about perfect and I promise you will not find driving a hassle based on its smooth and controlled response even to the sharpest of turns at a reasonable speed. Standard traction control also ensures good emergency handling. The 200 horses obviously allows for a pretty impressive pick-up, one that I guarantee you will not find on the similarly priced Toyota Camry LE, Avalon or for that matter even the Integra, Accord, BMW 325 series, Mazda 626 et al. The automatic transmission and braking systems also appeared to be about average although its worth remembering that the car I rented only had about 500 miles on it.

Comfort: Ah finally a car that would allow my 6'3&quot; frame to fit comfortably in the front seats AND the back seats with room to spare! Suffice it to say that I was thrilled. Standard options are elaborate and range from easily readable gauges to well placed cup holders in just the right spots. The front arm rest has a huge compartment that would fit just about everything. Mine had 2 pairs of sunglasses, a camera, zoom lenses as well as a couple of CDs. The trunk is also surprisingly larger than average. Visibility is pretty good with the exception of the fact that the optional spoiler blocks the view somewhat. I like the large rearview mirrors though which help to compensate for this &quot;oversight&quot;.

<b>NEGATIVES</b>

Interior: For the price, I feel that this is an area in need for serious improvement. The seat covers were not impressive, to say the least, and the imitation wood was not a turn on either. Maybe it's the 3.8L in action but the interior was a bit too noisy for my liking.

Wear and tear: My cousin works for GM and he reports that there have been calls regarding the Braking system especially the front brakes which apparently wear too easily. Also, the discs appear to have warping issues. This is unfortunately just the type of quality control issues I have come to expect from GM. There have also been reported problems with the electrical system, shock absorbers, water leaks, A/C as well as interior noise. The NHTSA safety complaints include some cases of fire in the dashboard area and the engine compartment as well as a couple incidents in which the Airbags failed to deploy.

<b>BOTTOM-LINE</b>
Much as I hate to say it, the 2001 Impala is typical of the older generation of big American cars who have no competitors when it comes to driving with comfort, style and power. However when you take into account the small details such as long term maintenance, its absurdly poor warranty when compared to its competitors and low resale value, the Camry, 626 and Accord immediately enter into the equation and many might argue even surpass it. My &quot;turn-off&quot; from wanting to buy this car is the fact that after a year or two of usage I would be forced into having to sell it for fear of encountering those afore-mentioned issues with brakes wear, electrical problems etc. So if you are looking for a powerful ride for a few days, by all means pick the Impala which is head and shoulders above the competition. I loved it for the week that I drove it. Personally, I would shy away from buying it though because of the long term problems that have yet to be disproved.<br><br>
