            Could things get any worse!!!!I loved how it looked...... after that it was all down hill. Besides the neat oval theme there is nothing about this car I liked.  First problem was a short in the steering column, ever time you turn right the radio would shut off.  Then as I drove home from a long vacation (at night) made a right hand turn and the headlights shorted out. (We ended up sleeping at a rest stop until the sun came up and comfort is not included with the oval theme)  Then I had problems with the tranny slipping and when you put it in reverse none of the electrical worked.  And to think this all happened before I could make my first loan payment.<br><br>
