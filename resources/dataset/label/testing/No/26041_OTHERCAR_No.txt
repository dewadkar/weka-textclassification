            I tried almost every mid-size sedan available before choosing the Stratus.  I fell in love with the comfort, which was a high priority since I put about 40,000 miles a year on a car.  The seats are very comfortable, and I can fit almost anything inside when I travel.  It's been 2 years now, and I still think it's the most comfortable mid-size sedan I've tried, but the maintenance is very high.  Like others, I have had trouble with the brakes not lasting - I have 80,000 miles now, and I've had all 4 rotors both shaved and replaced already, and I'm due for another shaving.  I have autostick, which is fun, and helps the engine slow the car down instead of the brakes, but it hasn't impacted the fast rate of wear on the brakes.  Chrysler may have fixed this problem, as they now offer 11&quot; disk brakes, which are more robust.  The 1999 cars only came with 10&quot;. 
The motor of my rear passenger window is dead, which I've heard about with other Stratus's.  I've already had the transmission rebuilt - at 65,000 miles.  The transmission problem is similar to that of the minivans, as they have the same transmissions.
The last problem so far is that my car takes a couple of turns to start when it's warmer.  This has happened since my first tune-up, and I've had Chrysler, GoodYear and Midas look at it without any results.
I would still recommend the car for comfort and ease of driving, but beware of the additional maintenance costs - I've had Chrysler products my entire life, and have never experienced this many problems.  Hopefully later editions will have fixed these.<br><br>
