            We bought this from CarMax for $16 K with 33 K miles about 2 years ago.
That's 4,000 miles/year (it currently has over 40 K miles)!

The single most annoying thing about this car are the loud squeaks that you can clearly hear over the CD when going on the hwy!

We took it to a dealership which informed us that all squeaks & rattles were only covered for the first 12-24 months.
Firestone said there was nothing they could do about it and this was a known problem with Nissans of similar model years also (it looks a bit like the Sentra).

It has a good sound system and the leather & sunroof/moonroof are great.

The transmission is quite jerky.
There are three settings for the automatic:
Comfort, Off, Power
Power apparently increases the RPM at which the gear shifts increasing acceleration.
Comfort lowers the RPM of the shift which makes for a smoother ride.

Even in Comfort mode, its pretty jerky.

No other problems yet.
The engine is a small 2.0 L 140 hp that gets loud and noisy on the hwy.
A couple of different friends have commented that it sounds like the engine is in the trunk.

Max recommended cruising speed is about 75 mph.

The acceleration is decent and the car handles well.
Love the dual power seats, mirrors, windows, locks.

<b>Updates: </b>

We finally took the car to a dealership and got the loud noise & squeaks fixed for $40!
The loud noise were bad ball bearings in the rear wheel which were covered under warranty.
The squeaks were due to lack of lubrication on the front 'sway-bar bushings' - don't really know what it means but its gone now and that's what matters.

The jerky transmission could have been due to overfilling of oil -
there was an extra half quart which was overflowing into the transmission fluid but it was about $120 to clean it up and refill the fluid so we postponed that.
'clean throttle body, induction service, set engine to specs' was what they wrote on the quote.

The new problems is that water seems to leak in from the front passenger foot area during a car wash and it seems to be more when the fan is on 'external' as opposed to the 'internal' circulation setting.
This would have cost $75/hour to find the problem alone!
Water also leaks in through the moonroof - you can see it drip into the tilting mechanism during a carwash.

The worst part about it was that this leak started about 1-2 months after the warranty expired on April 2000!
We don't plan to get this fixed.
This model was rated VERY reliable by Consumer Reports.

We did get a 99 g20 to drive for a day while ours was in the shop.
It was much:
* better looking
* more headroom & legroom
* better ergonomics
* CD/tape/radio combo (ours was CD/radio only)
* single switch for moonroof 
(the older ones have seperate switches for tilting or sliding)
* quiter during freeway driving

the only downsides were:
* still an anemic engine
* no more dual power seats! (that was a dumb idea) 
- only the driver's seat has power, passenger power is not even an option anymore

I think all 'luxury' cars with moonroofs should have a 'close' button that automatically shuts it with one click instead of having to hold it down (I just found out some Caddy models have an 'express' open/close moonroof) and a little light to indicate when it is open - I discovered that the moonroof had not been closed completely the hard way - during a car wash!

All so called luxury cars with moonroofs should have at least a 4-5 year warranty on leaks. Caddy offers a LIFETIME warranty against any moonroof leaks on some models (98 or later).

We're planning to sell it in a year.
