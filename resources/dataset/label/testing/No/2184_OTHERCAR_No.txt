            Well i thought my little Corolla was going to be the best car ever...boy was i wrong! I looked and looked for a car and i wanted a Toyota because i thought they were such good cars.
 Where can i start? First of all it's very small and cramped. It feels like your sitting right next to the person in the passenger side. The backseat was made for little kids only, don't try to fit adults back there. The space is so small for leg room and during the summer the people in the back stay hot because the Corolla's little air vents are tiny and it takes for ever to cool down. The vents are so small it's not worth having them! The small vents shoot out barely enough air to cool down the people in the front seat. Plus i feel that i put too much strain on the Corolla's engine when i drive it 60+mph and have the air on full blast. The Corolla kind of struggles to go when the air is up high. It also doesn't take bumps very well, the ride is anything but smooth. Every pot hole i hit makes the whole car shake and squeek. I fear that if i was in a car wreck the Corolla would smash like the little tin can it is. When i turn the radio up i can't hear all the road noise it makes. All i can say is that the Corolla is a car that i would drive to work and that's about it. Friends don't let friends buy a Corolla. I wish i would have never bought it, i have put so much work into it to make it run everyday.
