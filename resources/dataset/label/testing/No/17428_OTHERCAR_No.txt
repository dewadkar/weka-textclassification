            I bought this vehicle because I got a good deal from the Honda dealership and was impressed with it's looks.  What a mistake I made!  Now I'm stuck with a three year lease on a SUV I hate.  

This vehicle is very below average and I would not recommend it to anyone looking at SUV's.  I have had lots of annoying quality issues including: 
Rattles in the dash, electrical problems with the door locks and windows, transmission problems - rear-end slips when going around tight corners, tailgate problems, and directional pull issues from abnormal wear on the tires - oh yes - I also had to have the CD changer replaced three times. The 4 Wheel drive shifter lever makes a terrible buzzing sound when driving - the dealer says this is normal.  (According ot my Honda dealer -everything they can't fix is normal) - Oh yeh - and did I mention the recall where the factory may have caused some bolts to come loose on the rear axel?  

The vehicle drives and rides like a truck.  Very harsh ride which becomes very punishing after time.  The engine has a lot of power but the transmission does a terrible job of utilizing the power and locks into high gears way too early in the shifting cycle.  

I don't think anyone should buy this vehicle.  You can get a much quality and service elsewhere.
