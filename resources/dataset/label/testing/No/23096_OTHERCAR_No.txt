            I bought this camera due to the consistently high reviews that everyone gave it, and I love it.  Problem is that I can't use it because of the crappy software that comes along with it that's supposed to allow you to upload pictures to your computer (PhotoMax).  I've tried installing two different disks that Polaroid sent me on three different computers with no luck.  And to make matters worse Polaroid is the only digital camera company that does not make the drivers you need to use shareware available anywhere on the net.  So basically you are relegated to using their crappy software that doesn't work. Good luck if you buy this camera!<br><br>
