            Lets see we had bought a 1997 Dodge Caravan from a local dealer and it seemed as if we had a good vechile.  I mean after paying about $10,000 for it in June 2000 we never thought we would have to sink alot of money into it, at least not for awhile anyways.  It only had 58,000 miles on it.  We had not been offered an extended warranty like we should have been.  I had the van back with in my very limited warranty for the check engine light and horrible sounds when applying the brakes.  The check engine was eventually fixed but they said my brakes were metallic and were to make that sound and to cause the horrible black residue on my tires.  I believed them.  I then had my brakes looked at again in Dec. 2000 by another dealer who stated that I would need new brakes.  They never once mentioned anything about my rotors.  In Jan. 2001 we again took the van to be looked at by someone else and they showed us what was wrong.  Our brake pads were ok but should be changed but to top it off the rotors had been shaved down so many times that they were illegal.  The drivers side brake was stuck thus causing the horrible nose we heard and the drivers brake line had a hole in it.  We also had to replace the rear shocks and am gonna have to replace the front shocks soon.  We put 783.00 into this van since owning it for 9 months.  I would certainly request a carfax before buying oyur next vechile.  good luck
