            I bought this Sony Cybershot when SOMEHOW my DSC-F55 dissapeared, and I absolutely dislike the camera.  NOT because I am so used to the F55, BUT because of the reasons below.
First of all, the camera is too small and it only allows you to grip it with one hand decently while taking pictures.  Holding it with two hands, your left fingers go right into the eyepiece so you always have to be aware of that complication.  The entire grip is too small and unfit for human hands.  The clicker is a bit too far from the end as well, making it so that you have to place your finger over one knob to press the clicker.  
Next, the picture quality is just bad when compared to the older models.  All of the pics seem to come out a bit gray and fuzzy.  It DOES have a TIFF saving file mode, but you need at least a 16MB Memory Stick just to save one TIFF file.  
The Resolutions are ODD, it jumps from 640x480 straight to 1086x960 and other wierd res.  This camera is COMPLETELY intolerant of motion shots.  If you take one while in motion, you will get a piece of EXPRESSIONIST ART instead.  The CLICKER is very SLOW...If you want an ACTION PIC or to catch something WORTH DOLLARS, you will MISS the SHOT.

I highly dis-recommend this product.  I give it a Direct Mockery.<br><br>
