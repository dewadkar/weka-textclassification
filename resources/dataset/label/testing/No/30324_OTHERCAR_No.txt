            I bought this product to take photographs of items I was selling on eBay. It was the least expensive digital camera I could find at the time and from reading the box it seemed like the resolution would be fine for my purposes, but I have since learned that the quality is not nearly as good as you might think.

The store had one of the cameras set up for customers to try, but you can't actually see the photographs as they would appear on a computer, you can only test features and view the LCD display, and the pictures on the display lead you to believe that the pictures will be very high quality.

However when I got home and took some pictures with the camera I found out the quality wasn't nearly as good as I had expected. Certainly the quality was passable, and I have since discovered ways to make the pictures look better, for instance taking pictures outside without the flash, but the quality just didn't meet my expectations, so if you're looking for something with professional results, as for business use, you will definitely want to look at something else.

I also have a problem with the fact that it eats batteries like crazy and it DID NOT come with an adaptor to allow it to plug in to the wall, and you can NOT get an adaptor for the camera locally. It takes a special adaptor that you have to order from Vivitar and it is rather expensive.

Overall, this was a decent purchase for the money, though, and I would recommend this for someone looking for an inexpensive way to take pictures of family and friends for use as personal pictures.<br><br>
