            My husband owned our Paseo when we got married.  I absolutely loved the car.  It's cute and looks fun.  It feels like a sports car.  I loved driving it, it seemed to fly.  Then we started buying furniture and the trouble began....  This car is so small.  There is a back seat, but I don't know why they bothered putting it there because you can't fit people in it.  And you can't put anything else back there either. The real problem came when I hurt my hip and was using a wheel chair and a cane for a while.  You have to fold the seat down to fit the wheel chair in the car, it won't fit in the trunk.  And I have to lay the seat down just to get in the car because it is so cramped.  
I do have to say we haven't had any problems with the car itself.  We've replaced the muffler and that's it. It gets great gas mileage and it does drive nicely.  But the size thing out weighs all that other stuff for me.  It comes down to the fact that this car is simply not comfortable and not practical if you ever need to transport more than two people.
