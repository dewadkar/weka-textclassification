            I must say that owning a Dodge Neon was quite an experience for me. I was looking for something that I could afford both the car payment and the insurance. However repairing the car ended up costing more than the notes. 

The dodge Neon is a good car, but only for a short time. I like to compare it to an egg shell, it's good until it gets cracked! And once it gets &quot;cracked&quot; it's down hill from there. I would recommend this car for a first car, maybe for a sixteen year old, who does not put much strain on a vehicle. But if you are a traveler and you need a car good for highway miles, the Dodge Neon is not for you.

I can say that the Neon comes with an excellent stereo system. It is about the best thing in the car. The bottom line is, if you are looking for a car that will last, stay away from the Neon. I would recommend that if you have a major problem fixing it would not be the answer, get rid of it fast.      <br><br>
