            My parents picked out and co-signed for my brand new 97 Kia Sephia LS, only 17 miles on it.  My car payments tripled and the value has gone down to $3-4000.  Within the first year, I had my rotors replaced twice, my brakes done once, my check engine light continually on and my tape player was broke immediately!!!!  My battery fluids emptied out.  The sale was a bust from the start.  The salesman had us sign the wrong forms and gave me a higher interest even though we told him that it was going through a specific bank.  Then it was even harder to get the car put in my name, and the car didnt even work right!!<br><br>
