            I have a Monte Carlo Z-34 and also know a few others with a car like mine.  The car is great to drive.  It handles like a dream and is pretty fast.  One thing that all of us Z-34 owners have noticed about the car that we didn't before we bought them was the gas consumption.  The Z-34 uses much more gas than necessary with an average of 22 mpg. on the highway.  When you take into consideration how small the Z-34's engine is in comparison to the Camaro Z-28, one would think that they would be able to get better gas mileage, but that does not happen.  The Camaro has more horsepower, and better gas mileage.  I think that somebody at Chevrolet should explain why this is to all of the Z-34 owners.  I do love my car though, but do take this major factor into consideration when shopping for a car, especially with gas prices the way that the are.<br><br>
