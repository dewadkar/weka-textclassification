            I am about to graduate from an MBA program and, with my signing bonus, wanted to upgrade from my Chevy Cavalier(which I had purchased new several years ago) to a safe (I have a young daughter) car that was stylish, so I purchased the 2000 S40.

I have only owned 2 other new cars in my life, the Cavalier and a Nissan Sentra, so this is the frame of reference I am using to judge the Volvo.  

I have been shocked in the repeated problems I have had with this car since I purchased it last may.  Individually, they have been small things.  For instance, I have had to replace my trunk lock 2 times (and now taking it in for a third) as it sticks and will not open.  Various plastic parts are falling off.  The small "Volvo" decorative discs constantly fall off my wheels.  I have had all 4 replaced every time I take the car in.  The dealer admits that they made them too small.  The brake pads have already been replaced, which is odd as I drive mostly interstate too and from school and day care.  The wiring was faulty which caused our headlights to go out one night while on a long trip back from visiting relatives.  Of course, they have replaced all these things under warranty.  However, since some of these things seem to be perpetual problems, what happens when the warranty expires.  While I won't own the car after that point, I will certain feel bad for the person who does own it.

As I never had one mechanical or cosmetic problem with either of my prior cars (until they were out of warranty, but certainly not during the first 3 years), I am very concerned about my future experience with this car.  If I am having this many small problems now, I am concerned that I will be having major problems soon.

While I like the style, look and feel of this car while I am able to drive it (when it is not in the shop for repairs or for standard maintenance--which has been monthly), I regret my purchase.  Since almost anything in this price range would be more stylish and handled better than a Sentra or Cavalier, I believe I could have been happy with any other number of cars.

While this won't be an issue for me after graduation(when I finally have an income), I feel that the service costs are expensive for what you get.  My first oil change was $90.  My second Oil change (which included fluid checks and tire pressure checks) was $190.  Having come from cars that cost $15 for oil changes and $25 for oil changes and fluid checks, this seems a quite expensive.

From a dealer perspective, I don't blame them for the poor quality of this car.  They have fixed every problem except the trunk lock and the small discs that fall off the wheels constantly.  They have gotten me in quick when I needed it and they have turned around the car quick in most cases.  I just wish I wasn't getting to know all the mechanics on a first name bases.  In any case, I have been very happy with the dealership and, if they sold cars other than Volvos, they would get my business in the future.
