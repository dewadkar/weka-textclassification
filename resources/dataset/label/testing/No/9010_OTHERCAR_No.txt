            Unless you plan to use this vehicle for driving on non-highway roads under 40 mph, just say NO to this &quot;SUV&quot;.  Honestly, you can't even call it that, because it can't go ON-road over 40 mph let alone OFF road.  It's a &quot;cute&quot; little rugged station wagon, but not worth much more than that.  On vacation, we were in Washington state - LOTS of driving, through mountains, valleys, 3/4 of the state covered.  

Problems?  Let me count the ways...
1)  When you get over that magic number of mph I spoke about, the car rocks and sways like it's going to tip over - and that's on the flat straight aways in low wind conditions - Don't even THINK about trying to take it through mountains with any kind of wind or in high wind areas.  If you aren't prone to motion sickness, you will be after this.

2)  When trying to climb hills, the poor little engine that couldn't chugged and switched gears and you felt like you were riding with someone who hadn't learned to shift a manual transmission - this is on an automatic!  We were getting passed on mountain climbs by SEMI'S!

3)  You can barely fit 4 adults in the vehicle comfortably...especially if they're over 5'7&quot;.

All in all, we ended up only driving it the bare minimum after the first 2 full days of vacation, and at the earliest opportunity, ditched it to the rental car place and squeezed 5 of us into my parent's rented Nissan Maxima.  

I drove a Kia Sophia on a different vacation and loved it, but as far as &quot;SUV's&quot; go (and I use that term lightly), don't waste your money.  Even the Isuzu Rodeo was a better drive than the Sportage!<br><br>
