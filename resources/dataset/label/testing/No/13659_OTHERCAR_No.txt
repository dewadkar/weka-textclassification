            I bought my Sportage in March 1998.  By Fall it was in the garage on a regular basis. Fortunately for me, cuz I live in Florida, my AC works just fine.  If only I had brakes! Four sets of brakes in 40K miles!  Four replacements of the cat conv.!  Belts, 3 times. Your &quot;engine&quot; light could be the O2 sensor defect (3 times for me)and I just live with the problem now.  I have an EX and the paint fell off the bottom molding twice and is starting for the third time.  I've tried to  get rid of it and CANNOT trade it in, they laugh at me.  Now I'm going through the channels (too old for Lemon Law) of KIA Consumer and BBB Auto Line w/atty.  IOWs KIA=&quot;Car for Life&quot;.
