            I bought a 2000 328ci and have been in the shop 16 days over six months.  All kinds of minor items fail again and again.  The problems started with a clicking in the automatic windows.  Now there is a water leak in the passenger compartment.  I have had the dealer look at it again and again.  I am losing patience and about to seek legal help under the NY state lemon law.  Less then 12,000 miles and over 15 days in the shop in six months!! To make matters worse, I picked the car up after service and there was damage to the car.  Scratch in the door (the car's first) as well as damage to the interior AND the drivers seat had glue all over it.  No problem... it was only a $600.00 suit! I had better luck with a 10 year old Honda!<br><br>
