            I recently flew into Atlanta with my family and rented a car.  I needed a large enough vehicle for the four of us and our luggage.  About the only choice was a minivan.  We rented the minivan, to our dismay it was one of the worst experiences of our life.  Granted the rental company may have not been keeping up with maintenance on the vehicle, but one can only blame them for so much.  Not only the rattling but the faulty engine performance made for an altogether annoying ride.  I would not reccomend this vehicle to others looking to buy a minivan.  I am very dissapointed in this vehicle.<br><br>
