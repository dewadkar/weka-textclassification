            Honda S2000

	This is a marvel of technology at its finest for the current time.  Honda sets high standard for the rest of the industry.  Honda recently unveiled Insight, which has 60 mpg.  Honda is one of the finest automobile manufacturers in the world.  When I look around to shop for a new car, Honda is always among my choices because they make such good cars.  
	Having said that, Honda never really had high power sports machine.   Sure, they produce motorcycles and Prelude but those machines really aren�t up to Mustangs, Corvettes, or any of its closest competitors.  I often see these little Hondas that just buzzes around my car.  I love this because I own a Mustang GT.  I can just punch my car and leave them on my back mirror.  I often ask �Why are they doing to their cars?�  &quot;Why can�t they get a real sports car?&quot;  Modified Civics isn�t really up to Mustangs or Cameros.  So, Honda has created S2000 so I would stop laughing at their what I called Civic turned lawnmowers.  

[First Impression]
	This car looks very sharp and stunning.  It follows the similar look of Honda Accord, Civic, and CR-V�s sharp and edgy look.  This edgy look starts from their headlights to its tail pipe; I love this look.  The car is very small but looks very aggressive and it has a looks of sports car fighter.  It looks like it was born to challenge other serious sports cars.  This is the first serious sports car from Honda in my opinion.

[Inside]
	First thing you will notice when you get into this car is the tightness.  Everything is just tight.  The whole driver side fits around your body.  (I am 5-8, 170lb) So, if you are a big person, you might have hard time fitting in.  Interior has sports enthusiast in mind.   Its electronic instrument panel is cool looking.  The steering wheel feels good.  And there was this red Start button.  After you put a key to drive, you also have to press this button to start the car.  (this is typical of over hyped marketing thing.  when you go to movie theater, they always have this long introduction of how this or that theater is equiped with Sony Digital Surround Sound Technology.  SDSS or something; totally useless introduction.  Start Button, it's also useless.)  My car had red interior that matches red exterior that�s equipped with six-speed transmission.  I never drove six-speed transmission.  I was keep thinking, so should I shift little earlier on every shift.  

[Engine]
	The high-light of S2000 is that Honda�s 2.0 L engine produces 240 horsepower and 150 lb-ft torque.  That�s 120 horsepower per liter.  However, this power is only possible by reaching above 5000 rmp to 8300 rpm.  This means that I have to rev the engine harder and let the gear stay longer than usual to get the power.  This also means that if I decide not to drive like that, power isn't likley available.  Reving engine high isn't something you want to do in normal car or any car for that matter.  I mean, when was the last time you pressed your car to 8300 rpm, let alone just 6000 rpm.  So, I was bit skeptical of how this would all work.  

[Driving]
	Knowing that this car has 240 horses with light weight, I was very excited to get behind this wheel.  Getting inside of this car is bit difficult.  I don�t know why it should be difficult.  When I launched the car, it was like driving my old Hyundai Elantra at first.  Becauses of cars low torque, S2000 starts bit slow, a disappointing start.  I didn�t feel anything like driving my Mustang.  As I was shifting gears, i noticed that I was really getting the power.  Then I started to pushing the car to high RPM.  By then, I got the power i thought I could get but it was hard getting use to.  This car only had 150 lb torque.  Because S2000 low torque, car doesn't get pushed, another words, it doesn't give you that quick neck jerking feeling.  So, In S2000, you have to rev more to get power.  Since, you have to rev this car higher, you will end of driving it hard.  That�s how you get 240 horses.  After little while, I was getting little annoyed by high revving engine noise.  The noise gets even higher on the highway.  In fact, S2000 is very noisy car.  It's nosier than my Mustang.  

Suspension on S2000 can be very harsh.  You will feel every bump on the road.  Sure, it's a sport car but does it have to be harsh, i don't think so.  Steering wheel feels little week when you drive fast on the high way, not good.  Steering feels bit week, not a go-kart feeling when you are the highway, other wise the steering feels like a go-kart steering wheel, which I like.  Stick shift isn�t that smooth either.  I had real hard time backing because it was hard to put into reverse, another &quot;Not&quot; for this sport car.  Actually, i am not really a fan of any manual shift.  My Mustang is automatic because Mustang Manual was very hard to drive.  S2000 is bit easier but not by much.  It would be helpful, if I had automatic with this car.  Besides, most people cannot really shift the gear right to maximize their engine to be 6.52 seconds that car magazine often report.  Yes, you might say that you do shift right but then you might be exception of this common occurances people not shifting exactly right to get the optimal shifting performance.

[Conclusion]
Overall, this is a weekend car for those who have a lot of money.  Either that, or you just like this car so much that you can put up with its annoyances.  This was not made for every day driving.  I wished the car were V6-class instead of V4-class.  Because when the car is V4-class engine, you can feel that it�s little weak.  It just shows.  I think sports car enthusiasts will enjoy this little car but many of you wouldn�t enjoy driving this for very long because it�s not practical, it has very low utility, a lots of noises, and you will get tired of driving at High Rev.  

I enjoyed driving this car without the noises but I wouldn�t want to spend $35k+ or more, depends on how much money these Honda Dealerships want to make.  You can expect to may well above its MSRP, 42K to 45K.  Honda is expected to produce only 5000 of S2000 this year.  So, there is more demand which means Honda Dealership will raise prices and they do.  

There are better sports cars out there.  If you want a powerful sports car that has a lots of power, go look at Probe GT, Mustang Base or GT, or Camero becase these are better deal.  I considered buying Prelude but Prelude was no match for Mustang.  I might sound little bias but I think you can do better car with $35,000+.  Try Boxster or Audi A4 Quattro, if you want to spend that much money.  Honda has more than 500 dealership.  If each dealership gets equal number of S2000, each dealership only gets about 10.  By time you read this, those cars are probably all sold out or people are on waiting list.  

Despite of all might gripe, this is very cool car but i think you can spend $35,000+ more wisely.  

Here are my my wish list for S2000
1.  Quieter
2.  Better Interior Comfort
3.  V6-class Engine without high reving engine to get good power.
4.  Make, 5-speed automatic Transmission available
5.  better retracting roof.

[Update 05/10/2000]
Yes, Mustang isn't Honda S2000 but it doesn't cost $35,000.  You don't have to spend $35,000 to get that power.  I never said S2000 was bad car but not for $35,000.  I would get BMW or Porsche Boxter, at least they have V6-class powerplant.  <br><br>
