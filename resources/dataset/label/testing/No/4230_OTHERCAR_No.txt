            I purchased my 1994 Cadillac DeVille in June 2001 with only ~50,000 miles on it.  At the time, I traded a 1992 Lincoln Town car with ~120,000 miles.  I wanted a luxury automobile with less miles than my 1992 Lincoln Town car, and I believed that the 1994 Cadillac DeVille would be commensurate because both cars are luxury automobiles.  

However, I immediately discovered how uncomfortable the 1994 Cadillac DeVille was relative to my 1992 Lincoln Town car.  Both cars have ample room for the driver, but the 1994 Cadillac DeVille's seat cannot be adjusted to give me any sort of comfort.  My 1992 Lincoln Town car did not have a lumbar adjustment and neither does the 1994 Cadillac DeVille, but my lower back and neck are actually sore after driving 32 miles to work each day in the 1994 Cadillac DeVille.
 
My 1992 Lincoln Town car ran very well on regular gas (87 octane).  The 1994 Cadillac DeVille requires premium gas (93 octane).  I tried to use the 89 octane in the 1994 Cadillac DeVille, but the engine made a lot of noise.

The 1992 Lincoln Town car took a regular oil change (at Midas: ~$20-25).  The 1994 Cadillac DeVille requires an extra quart of oil (6 not 5) and a more expensive filter - bringing the cost of an oil change to approximately $36 (again at Midas). 

The dealer that I purchased the car from (Inskip's used car division: Automax, Warwick, RI) had supposedly put a new battery in the 1994 Cadillac DeVille in late June 2001.  In early April of 2002 (after only 9 months), the battery died.  When I took the 1994 Cadillac DeVille to Sears to have the battery/starter/alternator checked, Sears determined that the battery put into the 1994 Cadillac DeVille was not strong enough to support all of the electrical systems.  Apparently, the 1994 Cadillac DeVille needs the best (most expensive) automobile battery - a Diehard Gold battery.

I have also just recently purchased two new tires (~$200)- which I would file under "regular wear-and-tear" except the 1994 Cadillac DeVille supposedly had four new tires put on by Inskip/Automax, Warwick, RI 9 months ago.

In addition, one wheel's center cap rattled off somewhere on the highway.  The replacement cost would have been ~$75, but I purchased a used center cap for $35.  

In the nine months that I have owned the 1994 Cadillac DeVille, I have been extremely uncomfortable and I have spent more money for gasoline and regular maintenance items than the Lincoln Town car requires.
