            We had rented this vehicle at an airport in the summer, and we were not very happy with this vehicle.  The vehicle had some good things, but mostly, it was a poor quality ride.

*******************Interior************************
The interior was clean and functional.  The front console was very easy to use.  The radio system was good.  The climate control system was horrible.  The air conditioning system would just not cool off the car even after driving 100 miles.  It was consistantly hot in the car and it was very annoying.  The seats were base buckets which were comfortable.  The back seat was nice and roomy, and the storage area was large.

******************Exterior***************************
The exterior of the vehicle was somewhat "old" in my opinion.  Jeep has kept this model look since the 1990's.  It is lacking the character that other SUV's in it's class hold now.  It had the Laredo package which included the plastic cladding on the side.  This was somewhat helpful when we were going down dirt roads, meaning we didn't have to worry about scratches.

******************Engine*****************************
The engine our vehicle had was the Powertech(R) L-6 engine with 190 horsepower.  Our vehicle came with the 4 speed transmission and had the automatic part-time 4 wheel drive.  The engine was okay in acceleration, but the GMC Envoy that we own at home acclerates MUCH quicker.  When going up a 6% grade mountain, the transmission had a very hard downshift, so hard that it actually pulled us into our seats on the way up it.  The engine also strained a lot going up.  The engine was fine though on the flat highway.

******************Components*************************
Jeeps have been legendary for their off-road vehicles, especially the Wrangler and past CJ models.  But I believe that this vehicle is more of a city/road vehicle more than an off-road vehicle.  When going up a so called "Jeep" trail, this vehicle handled okay, but the ground clearance was so low that it almost hit every rock and bump on the way up, causing us to turn around.  This trail wasn't even a really hard trail, more like a dirt road.  The tires also failed the test on the regularly maintained dirt road.  We experienced 2 flats during the 1 week we were out there from just driving on little stones.  If you were to go offroad in this vehicle, I suggest you buy stronger, higher ply tires.

********************Fit and Finish******************
The fit and finish was not very good.  When we took it to the car wash, the front window started to leak like it had a big hole in it.  This caused us to abort this task, and skip the rest of the car wash.  But besides that, it was pretty good everywhere else in the vehicle.

********************Final Thoughts******************
I believe that this is a good rental vehicle/fleet vehicle.  In my personal opinion though, I would much rather have my Envoy or Trailblazer.  They perform much better and are about the same price.  They are more refined and have better quality.
