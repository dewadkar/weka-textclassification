            I bought a '98 Sebring Coupe with 6,000 miles on it.  Loved the sleek styling, the road control, etc.  But the love affair ended soon.  WIthin six months of ownership, a tire rim went bad (they're made of really soft aluminum so they look good)and a flat tire.  This venture cost about $750 to replace both tire and rim.  Oh, by the way...the DEALERSHIP did not have the equipment to change the tire (put on new rim)!!!!!!!!  It was too big they said!!!  So, off to the GOODYEAR dealership I went...who said it would be several days before a tire could be found (not a standard stock item).  This episode took a full day off work (at least).

Next, the passenger door panel fell off.  Took it to the shop, they &quot;fixed it&quot;.  In another two months or so....IT FELL OFF AGAIN!!!!  Turns out to be really bad engineering (plastic door clips) and Chrysler finally put out an alert on that.  About 3 months later, the passenger door panel fell off.  The dealership &quot;forgot&quot; to order the parts and/or have them painted the right color....so I had fun driving oround for about 6 weeks without a door panel (AGAIN)!!!

About this same time.....the sun roof upholstery came loose.  The Dealership  conviently &quot;forgot&quot; again to order these parts.  Finally replaced.

Then, About 6 months later, just when I was bragging about how great the car handled in bad weather (snow and ice)....due to it's capability to hug the road, and wide wheel base, another flat tire and bad rim.  Again delays because the wrong color of rim was ordered by the tire dealer.

Now...I am not that bad of a driver and avoid pot holes and curbs totally!  Are the Goodyear tires that bad or is it the  Sebring soft aluminum rims causing the trouble.  Again told to come back in another week so they  could &quot;locate&quot; a tire.  

Well, got that fixed after shelling out another $700.  ($200 tire plus $400 rim plus labor).

Next day, the engine light comes on.........they say it's the emissions system and want another $150.  ENOUGH!!!!!

Unless you have deep, deep pockets....don't buy this vehicle.  The tires are very expensive and apparently hard to find.  I have had to replace my donut tire in large part due to the unavailability of replacement tires!!!!!  There goes another $125.

I have requested tune ups at 30,000 miles, 36,000 miles and at 43,000 miles only to be told by the service people that &quot;Tuneups are not needed until 100,000 miles&quot;.

I know when I get to 100,000 miles, they will tell me that tuneups were needed at 30,000, 45,000, etc,!!!!!!

BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!

Reliability -- POOR!!!
