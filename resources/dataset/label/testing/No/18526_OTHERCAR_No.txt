            This vehicle is a family car, bought by my father.  It was bought used in 1997.  He was looking for a decent car with a good reputation and a strong service record.  Well, at least he got the reputation down.  Audis, while beautiful and a long, storied past, are overrated.  At least this 1994 90S is.  I've brought this car into the Audi shop at least 10 times in the past two years for service related issues.  Everything from the catalytic converter not working properly to a lurch in stopping to the leaking windshield wiper fluid box came up.  That stupid fan kept running after the ignition was off, for some reason I still don't know.  I was fortunate enough however not to pay for everything.  If there is one good thing about Audis, it is their warranty plans...which cover alot.  Driving the vehicle is a decent experience.  Shortages on acceleration and power are made up with the smooth ride.  The Audi has one of the best suspension systems in the world.  A good sound system, coupled with cold A/C for hot days and warmed seats in the cold make for a nice ride.  The cabin can get a little cramped though, especially for taller people.  Other than that, it's all good.  Yet, all these amenities don't make up for the problems the car causes on your schedule when you have to keep bringing it into the shop.  If you have alot of patience, go with this car.  It's just too troublesome.<br><br>
