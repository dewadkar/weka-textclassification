            We bought our 1995 Astro van with 18,000 miles on it.It was 2 
years old. Since that time we have replaced the engine 
($3,200), Front rocker arm assembly, ($700), Brakes($400), 
Shocks ($250),rear seal($175),new battery($75), Now the 
anti-lock brake light is on and the front end shakes when 
braking(what next????). My 1975 Chevy Vega was more reliable.  
I replace my oil every 3,000miles.  For the weight and size,
I think a full sized van would be a better bargin.    
I can't wait to get rid of this piece of junk!  I never spent 
this much on repairs as this vehicle.    

1995 Chev. Astro for sale, good reliable transportation, PS,
AC,AWD,50,000miles. Well maintained. b/o 

6/5/00-Since this epinion was written, I have continued to 
repair and maintain this vehicle.  In the last 3 weeks I have 
replaced the muffler, alternator, windshield wiper motor, exhaust manifold gasket.  $1,400 total.  I came very close to getting rid 
of it, but I have so much money invested in it...BTW the air 
conditioning needs to be repaired now...          <br><br>
