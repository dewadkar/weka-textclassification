            I recently had to take my ford explorer to the shop to get repaired and the car the gave me for the weekend was a mercury tracer.  Let me tell you, it was one of the worst driving experiences of my life.  The transmission is terrible, the pickup is, well, there is no pickup, and there is hardly ant space.  It might be that I am used to my explorer, but I dont think so.  Also, the stereo system is not the best I have ever heard and the passenger room in the back is very cramped.  I would not recommend this car to anyone.  please check out my other opinions.  bbeck01<br><br>
