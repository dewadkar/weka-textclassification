            Interesting that everyone else loves this vehicle.  My impression is that folks test drive the vehicle and don't actually drive it on a daily basis.  Or, if they do buy it, they write a review while they are still enamored with it -- and before they have the chance to really get to know the vehicle.

I purchased my 2002 Subaru Forester (L) 8 months ago.  I, too, loved mine when I first bought it.  Then I "got to know it".

Like another reviewer posted, my Subaru also had a clogged valve in the gas tank.  It took 17 hours of labor to take apart the Subaru to get to the gas tank, change out the part, then put the car back together.  I think they must not have put the transmission in place correctly, because now I have all sorts of transmission problems - ever since they dropped the transmission to get to the gas tank.  

The dealer says "it's a trait of the car" -- and they won't fix it -- even though it's under warranty. 

The air conditioning in my car is quite wimpy.  On really hot days it's quite warm in there - not a very comfortable ride.

And, the paint is peeling and chipping off.  Dealer says it's due to "rocks in the road" and the warranty doesn't cover it.  I've counted 25 places where the paint is peeling and chipping.  Could that many rocks have hit my car in the past 8 months?  Why haven't so many rocks hit my other vehicles in the past?  This car hasn't gone off road at all; are there THAT many rocks on the road available to hit my car in a mere 8 months?

I can't recommend you purchase this car.  Look elsewhere for a better vehicle.
