            The Durengo has to be one of the sexiest SUVs around, and yet, I feel so dissapointes after 6 months of ownership: expensive services, mediocre attention at the dealership, and dishonest repair crews have led me to switch to a new Chevy Sonora.

The Durango�s bet features are: confort, power and traction. Under muddy conditions even mediocre a/t tires are commanded by the excellent drivetrain and transmission in the 4wd version. The seats are quite supportive and the adjustments are fairly good, but not for my back. 

The cargo space is better than most SUVs, even better than most minivans, put all that plastic account for a few broken �eces during rough handling. It is not a good choice for city driving because one reason: FUEL consumption. Its an expensive vehicle to mantain, almost 30% higher than my current Chavy Sonora.

The bigest problem in my book is not the car itself, but the quality of service I get from the dealer in Mexico, where I live: I had a small leakage in the transmission, and the shop manager told me that they had to change the whole piece ( a whopping $780 USD bill). I went to a friend�s shop run by a bunch of Chrysler and Dodge ex-mechanics, and the whole thing was fixed just by changing some rings and bushings: just $80!
Also: every time I take it out from service, the fuel tank is almost empty..WHY?

Other problems I�ve encountered: a noisy dashboard, a loose glove compartment, few broken plastic pieces from the seatbelt, panel doors and seat adjustment, broken water hoses and 2 snapped AC bands (which have to be adjusted very often.., and a broken exhaust pipe retainer. Add all this to a lousy 7.5km per liter performance...

Its not a SUV to be abused in rough conditions, because in doing so, you will be riding in a vehicle noisier than a rattlesnake.
