            A good friend of mine, &lt;A href= <a href='/user-mikem3'>http://www.epinions.com/user-mikem3</a> &gt;MikeM3&lt;/a&gt;, owns this &quot;driving machine&quot;. It is an okay car, but there are many things that General Motors could have done to make this a much better sports car.  First off they should have made keeping the weight down a priority.  The car's stopping distance would have greatly improved if the car wasn't so heavy.  Oh yeah i forgot i am talking about an American car here, low curb weight has never been a priority. Also stopping distance could have improved if GM had made rear disc brakes a standard option, but this is asking a lot of GM. 

As far as the interior goes, it looks good when you are not in it.  Everything is designed well, except it is uncomfortable.  The seats in the back are uncomfortable even for small children.  The front  passenger seat is a little more comfortable, however there is this &quot;footrest&quot; in the floorboard.  This bump in the floor is caused be the catalytic converter.  So when riding shotgun in Mike's Firebird i sit slightly askew.  This yet again proves that GM is not really concerned with passenger comfort.  The seats also feel cheap, the ones in my 1986 Corolla feel like they are more expensive.  

This leads me up to that whole lack of visibility thing.  When you sit in the driver's seat you will notice that you have a tough time seeing the front end of the car if you are under 5'10&quot;.  This is bad for a sports car.  In a true sports car seeing the front end shouldn't be a problem, stopping distance should be much shorter than the Firebird's, and the suspension should feel a lot tighter.  Driving in any sort of precipitation is scary.  The back end of the car likes to slide all over the place.

I wouldn't recommend buying this car if you are under 5'8&quot;, have kids, or live in a rainy part of the country.  If you want a sports car buy an Acura Integra, a Honda S2000, a Toyota Supra or almost any other sporty import.  <br><br>
