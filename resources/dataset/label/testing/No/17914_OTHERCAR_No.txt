My Mountaineer was a 1998.  I have to say it was the worst car I ever owned.  I was a previous Mercury owner for the 4 years prior to me leasing this Mountaineer, and I was very satisfied and have left Ford because of this experience.  When I first got my suv it would pull severely to the right when I was driving on the highway.It would shake and then out of know where tug the  right. The first 2 times I brought it in for service they kept saying it was the tires. Then they finally determined that it was a bent axle. They replaced my tires .  In the year and a half that I had that car my tires were replaced at least 2 times on each tire.  I never felt so unsafe in a vehicle as I did in my Mountaineer. The last straw was when I got a flat tire on I-95 in rush hour and I said I couldn't take it anymore. The next day I went and terminated my lease 6 months early so that I could feel safe again .It cost me plenty to terminate but it was worth it. I am also very disappointed in Ford .I called the presidents office and they would'nt do anything, they told my I had to go to the dealership. I then Wrote to Ford a very extensive letter on why they were loosing a very valuable customer and they did'nt care.  I would think twice about this vehicle.<br><br>
