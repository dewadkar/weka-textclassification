            We bought a 1996 Chevy Astro AWD in December, 1996, while living in South Dakota during its worst winter in 50 years.  My previous minivan (Dodge Grand Caravan with 130,000 miles) was showing its years, and all I wanted was a minivan that was safe in a state with an extremely cold climate and the worst snow removal program I'd ever experienced anywhere.  The Astro, an end-of-year sale with a GulfStream conversion package, was purchased with the help of $3000 in GM Mastercard credits.  It had All Wheel Drive, dual air bags, and anti-lock brakes.  It also weighed about as much as a Hummer!!  I called it my &quot;safety-mobile.&quot;  Two years later we moved to a warmer climate, and I decided that it wasn't worth keeping it for its only virtue (safe when driving on glass....)  It is heavy, uses lots of gas, and has very poor visibility out the side and rear windows.  The rear seat is almost impossible to get out (so different from the Caravan,) making it more difficult to transport heavy or cumbersome items (with two kids in college, we've done our share of short hauls.)  It's a very noisy car, and squeaks seem to come up regularly.  The drink holder on the rear right sliding door is very poorly designed--if your child keeps the holder down and slides the door open, it breaks the first time you use it.  It has had an average repair record (although the brakes lasted over 50,000 miles...although, remember, we were living in a rural state for 40,000 of those 50,000 miles.)  I still love minivans...I just want one that's a little less cumbersome.<br><br>
