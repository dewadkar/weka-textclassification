            I had my heart set on buying a Jeep Grand Cherokee, I didn't need to be sold on it.  I went to the dealership wanting to test drive and ask a few questions before purchasing and I ended up leaving, vowing to never buy another Jeep again.  The sales people were so arrogant and rude it was laughable.  I mentioned that I was looking at some other SUVs and they started going off about Jeep being a higher class vehicle and if I want the prestige and stature that goes along with driving a Jeep, then I better buy one.  What a cheeseball.<br><br>
