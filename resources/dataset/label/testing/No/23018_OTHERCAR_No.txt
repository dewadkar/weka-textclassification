            Polaroid's PhotoMax PDC 640.   STAR_STAR
This digital camera is small and easy to handle.
My wife purchased this camera for me for my 35th birthday.  
The intended use was for eBay photos.
The PDC640 is very, very easy to use.  This comes from someone with absolutely zero digital camera experience.  
Just open front lens cover (which turns the camera on), select your distance setting (which is on back illustrated in pictures) and snap your picture.
I do not think any digital camera could be this easy.  
The camera gives you the options of reviewing you photos, deleting them and/or saving them from a disc.
As for as the quality of the pictures, I would say &quot;not so hot&quot;.
I thought it was just my photo taking, until we started using a different digital camera at my office.  The photos do not even come close.  The Polaroid's pictures are of lesser quality and clarity.
Also, this camera only gives you the option of taking up to 24 pictures,  I thought this was terrific, until I started using others..up to 5 times as many photos may be taken.
As far as the accessories, very easy to use.  Adapters plug right into the camera and into the computer..
Would not recommend to anyone.<br><br>
