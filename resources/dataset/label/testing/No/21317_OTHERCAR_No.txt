            I grew up in Michigan.  You know, the birthplace of the American automotive industry.  I freely admit that I'm just a bit biased against Japanese cars.  I do consider myself open-minded, however, and it's with that spirit that we rented a 1999 Toyota Camry last year.  Basically put, I'd heard and read so much about this Toyota &quot;benchmark&quot; sedan that I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about.

The Camry we rented was the LE trim level, with a 2.2-liter, 133 horsepower four-cylinder motor attached to a 4-speed automatic transmission.  Usually, trying to move a 3100 lb. car with a 4 cyl. and an automatic is a recipe for lame performance, but in this case I was pleasantly surprised.  The Toyota's base engine is actually gutsier than the numbers would suggest.  Straightline acceleration, although I can't describe it as &quot;spirited,&quot; is adequate.  On the highway, though, this car can run all day at 70 miles per hour with no apparent effort, and still have a reserve for passing traffic.  The transmission shifted relatively smoothly, though not as seamlessly as the 4-speed automatic in the Oldsmobile Intrigue we used to own.

The suspension was a surprise as well, but not in the same way as the engine.  The Camry felt like a lightweight, flyaway joke on the road.  Not floaty in the Buick sense of the word...&quot;boingy&quot; describes it more accurately; ripples in the road surface made the car porpoise up and down on the springs, turns made the car lean alarmingly to the side, and heavy braking felt like it was bouncing the bumper off the road.    

The steering felt lightweight and overboosted as well.  While providing more feel than a Buick LeSabre, it still felt somewhat like playing a video game to steer the Camry.  The car stuck to the road fairly well, and the 0.77-gee roadholding index backs that up, but with the body roll, bouncy suspension and lack of feel, it <i>felt</i> like we were all going to die.

Outside the Camry, there's not much to say about the styling.  It's well established that they're a bland car.  You're either indifferent to it, or noncommital about it.  The tail-lights were rather small, but that's been updated for 2000.  The gaps between body panels are tight and uniform, although the sheetmetal feels rather thin.

Inside, Toyota has put high-quality vinyls and plastics where you usually touch things, like the steering wheel, shifter, doorhandles, knobs and buttons, etc...  However, in the places that are less-travelled they've resorted to Fisher-Price as a plastics supplier.  The garage-door opener cubby on the ceiling felt like Tupperware, and the doorbins, where people usually don't look too closely, were flimsy-feeling and wobbly.  Also, the fabrics and carpeting of this particular rental were already horribly stained and dirty, more so than other rentals we've had.

The seats are a story all their own.  I haven't spent extended periods of time in chairs this uncomfortable since I got out of high school.  Seemingly made of cement, these seats have a notable lack of padding, and what there is, is too squishy to be comfortable.  Even with 6-way position adjustments, it wasn't possible to get comfortable.  Combined with a total lack of lower-back support, thigh-support or side support, these are some wretched seats.

Most people who are asked their reasons for buying a Toyota cite reliability as a major factor.  I won't address this directly, as it is impossible to speculate on reliability based on a 2-day rental experience.  Personally, the 10-year-old Camrys I see on the road currently are in sad shape, but that isn't a definitive conclusion.  I will personally have to wait until 2009 to see how many 10-year-old Camrys are still rolling down the road, before I make any statement about their reliability.

Overall, the Camry seemed like a car built to satisfy owner satisfaction surveys.  All of the individual concerns of buyers have been addressed.  Does the engine have power?  Yes.  Does it shift smoothly?  Yes.  Is the stereo clear?  Yes.  Do the switches and controls feel like high quality?  Yes.  But, assembled into a car the individual parts don't mesh into a cohesive unit as does a BMW, for example.  

It feels like they've had one dept. isolate itself and design an award-winning engine, and another dept. isolate itself and design a quality radio, and a third dept. isolate itself and design a nice steering wheel, and so on.  At the very end of it all, it feels like they took all of these components that were designed, in isolation, to satisfy American buyers, and then simply attached them together.

They say: &quot;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;  In this case, the Camry doesn't feel like the whole, it feels like the sum of its parts.<br><br>
