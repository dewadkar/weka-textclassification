            When my husband bought me a 1991 Cavalier, I was so excited. I always thought they were pretty cars.It was loaded! It was an automatic, seats were comfy, and I could put the seat back as far as I needed. Well, it looked nice, but it was the biggest hunk of junk ever put on four wheels. every time I went down the street something went wrong with it. First the engine cooling fan, then the engine control computer, on and on. A cheap part couldn't break on it.After all was said and done, we spent $749.78 in engine work, in about three and a half months. The car never did run right again. Someone did do me a favor, they decided to put it out of its misery (and mine) by totaling it while it sat in front of my house. I don't know if the newer Cavaliers are built any better, and I don't want to find out. The heartbeat stops here.<br><br>
