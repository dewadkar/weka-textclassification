            I bought my Impreza L for a number of reasons  -  It is equipped with 4 wheel drive; It came with a very powerful engine for the size/weight(2.2 liter)and the road handling is very good. ;All the popular accessories are standard; and it was well priced. For the reasons I just listed, it is very likely that the pros who review a brand new model of this car are going to like it - however, the advantage that I have over the pro's, is that I've driven mine for 40k miles.

Pros  - Powerful and very responsive engine, considering that it's only a four cylinder. Four speed automatic transmission (my opinion - all automatics should be 4 speed). Good A/C system.

Cons (they are many)  - Brakes make a grinding/scraping noise just before stopping; dealer response to this problem is that I'm &quot;not hard enough on my brakes&quot;. Can't get this resolved.  

- Very noisy interior, especially on concrete roads - again, no solution from Subaru. 

- Rattle inside steering column developed at about 18,000 miles; Subaru's response &quot;sorry, you have more than 12,000 miles, we're not responsible&quot;. The quality of the car's assembly is poor, and as a result I have several interior parts that have either fallen off, or have broken simply because they were not installed with due care (examples - a/c vent flaps have come out of place, inside the housing, and can no longer be adjusted; screws have fallen out of sun visors; various parts of the dash board rattle on bumpy roads). 

- The Clarion stereo radio is a piece of junk! It plays well on FM, and there is good stereo separation, however it is terrible on AM. 
I experience a lot of electronic interference, especially in rainy weather. This was a common problem on car radios up through the 1960's but I did not expect it on a '98 model. I give Subaru some credit in that they have replaced the radio twice, but the problem persists and they refuse to do anything more. 

- This is the only car in this size/price class that I know of that doesn't have a fold down rear seat.

- The windshield wipers are TWO DIFFERENT SIZES. Nifty!!  Instead of buying one pair of replacement blades, you now have to buy two different ones and hope that you don't loose them before the next replacement. <br><br>
