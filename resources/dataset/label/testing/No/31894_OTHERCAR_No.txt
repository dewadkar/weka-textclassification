            I had an Oldsmobile achieva sc with the quad 4 engine. I bought it about 2 years ago and had it only 4 months before it died on me. I like the way the car handled especially on curves and the good gas mileage that it got on the highway. I had many problems with it thought. First of all I always had low oil pressure but not low in the red. I took it to different mechanics but they said it was fine and nothing was wrong with it. Nothing mechanically wrong, I had to change struts and the engine bolts. After about 4 months however the car started to make a noise then shut off within a matter of minutes. It did not overheat or anything and I still do not know what went wrong. The engine was running fine and sounded ok, a very slight knocking which you can hear only if it is very quite. I took it to a mechanic but they said they could not tell me what was wrong with it unless they took the engine apart and that was going to cost a lot, especially since I bought the car for about 2000 dollars and just to check was going to cost around 600 dollars. SO I never got it checked. So my suggestion is to take it to a good mechanic before you buy and if you are going to by this car make sure you get some type of warranty if you can because it is worth it. Another downfall to the car is that the driver side received very low scores in test crashes yet passenger side received a high score. So it probably wouldn't be good for teenage drivers. If the car works I love it. I loved driving it handles great, great stereo system, and a nice look. Too bad it broke down on me. The quad 4 engines like the one in this car have had problems and they told me it could be the engine rod that broke on my car. I still have the car and maybe someday I'll get it fixed by buying a rebuilt engine and have that put into it.
