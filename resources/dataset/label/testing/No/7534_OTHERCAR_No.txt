            Recently, my wife and I went shopping for a new vehicle.  Of course we already knew what kind of monthly payment and �how much car� we wanted to get into, so we visited the Mitsubishi dealer here in San Antonio�

We originally wanted to test drive the Galant to compare it to a Honda Accord EX (V-6).  But upon entering the Mitsubishi dealer, the sales representative, who by the way was the best I have ever known, stated that we could get into a Mitsubishi Diamante for the same cost as a Honda Accord we were looking at due to the great 1.9% financing being offered at that time.  So we decided to look long and hard at the Mitsubishi Diamante.

At fist glance, the Diamante resembles that of a BMW.  Not exactly mind you�but it does exhibit some of the same physical characteristics�pointy snout, tall back end, round headlights, etc.  But that didn�t really matter to us anyway.  We were there to compare it to the Honda Accord.

The Diamante comes standard with a 240 Hp engine which was 40 horses more than the Accord.  The car was also bigger, both inside and out (the back seat was huge), which gave the vehicle a heavier curb weight that was evident when cornering.  It was a very smooth ride with respect to the handling.  The transmission shifted properly and at an adequate RPM level to provide the necessary power to get up in a hurry.  

In addition to the larger sized engine, the Diamante offered features that the Honda Accord did not.  It had dual heated seats, dual heated power mirrors, dual climate zones, memory seats (3 settings) and a couple more cup holders�Of course, you would suspect that the car has more features because the sticker price of the car was an additional $3500 when comparing invoice prices.

The appointments in the car were nothing but luxury.  The seats enveloped your body providing that extra comfort you would expect from a $29000 sticker priced automobile.  The instrument panel had a smoked plastic covering on it so that when the car was started the panel behind the smoked covering would light up providing you with an outstanding instrument panel display.  

The car�s visibility was also excellent, although I would have liked a higher placement of the side mirrors�they seamed a little low.

With the financing and the car�I WAS READY TO BUY.  There was one little problem though.  The steering wheel of the car seemed to vibrate between 55-68 miles-per-hour.  I pointed this out to the sales representative.  He stated that the car that I test drove had been sitting on the lot for over a month and maybe the tires were low.  So he gave me the keys to another Diamante.  Same problem.  I requested the keys to another car.  Still same problem.

Finally, the salesman stated that the dealership just received a new Diamante that was still on the truck.  So he asked me to come back the following Monday (we were there Saturday) to give this one a test drive.  I said OK.  After all, I loved the car itself and was ready to buy if the steering wheel did not shimmy.  

Monday arrived and I was eager to drive.  Ironically, the car, just off the truck was fully detailed and ready for my signature on the purchase agreement�the salesman knew I would buy the car if I liked it.  So we both went on for the final test.  Sure enough this one did the same thing.  The salesman felt it and approached the sales manager of the dealership exclaiming �the car shakes!�  He was angered to say the least.  He knew he lost a sale.

The bottom line is that no one should pay a high dollar for a car that does not exhibit a smooth-ride all of the time.  My wife and I just could not bring ourselves to spend that kind of money on a car where our friends and family would get a ride and say �why does your car shake?�

I would recommend, if you are in the market for this car, to think long and hard on whether or not you can live with that kind of ride.  The car was beautiful.  I loved it.  Handled nice in turns, great stereo, good financing, and even a smooth-ride except for between 55-68 mph�.
 
But my money is valuable, and there are substitutes for this vehicle.  We did purchase the Honda Accord EX V-6 and are extremely happy with the purchase.  No we did not get as great of financing, but in lieu of that, the resale value of the car is actually better than the Diamante anyway.  Comparing both vehicles, one year old 15000 miles the Diamante average trade in is 20,000.  The Accord is 21,000.  After two years with 30000 miles, the Diamante is worth 17,000�the Accord is 19500.

So take a look at the car, you may be able to live with the car.  I could not�.
