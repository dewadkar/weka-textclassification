            I seriously considered purchasing this car in conjunction with the Nissan XTerra, Pathfinder, Honda Passport and Toyota 4Runner.  I was completely unimpressed after a closer inspection of this vehicle at the dealership.

The Montero Sport has one great thing going for it: Exterior styling.  It looks great, especially in black or grey with tinted rear windows in the XLS &amp; up models.  But once I stepped inside the negatives started cropping up: poor road visibility, cramped interior, unimpressive controls and uncomfortable seats.

I was surprised to find that the ride was bouncy.  The power was lacking, in a big way.  Acceleration was poor and the engine very, very noisy at high RPMs.  There was a noticeable sway when cornering.

I was disappointed, and surprised.  I was really hoping that the car would be a contender, but the competitors have Mitsubishi beat, especially on the inside (where you spend 100% of your time driving it).  Even the lowly XTerra, at the bottom of the SUV market, felt and rode better than the Montero Sport.

At a 25-30k price tag, I thought that the Pathfinder was a better buy, especially with the new 240 hp engine.  If you're ready to buy a Montero Sport, make sure you test drive at least one other car, you just might change your mind.<br><br>
