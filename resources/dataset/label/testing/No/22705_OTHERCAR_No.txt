            I drive a 1995 plymouth neon.  I have owned it for 2 years.  To be honest, I have had very bad of luck in it.  In the first year my trunk lock had broken, the glove box, and the power steering went out in it.  I take very good care of my car and so it wasn't an operator faulty.  In the second year, I thought something was wrong with my transmission, so I took it in to the car dealership where I had bought it and they told me it was fine.  After driving it another 500 miles, the head gasket blew out in it.  Although my warranty was up, I did some research and come to find out, neon had made a bad design on my model car.  Plymouth though, stood behind it and replaced it for $120; which really saved me.  I think that yes, it has gotten me from point A to point B, but if I could go back, I would have purchased something more dependable.<br><br>
