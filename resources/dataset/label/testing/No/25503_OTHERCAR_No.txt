                 I went looking for a truck with only one thing in mind, price.  A dealership in Baton Rouge (Diamond Mazda) was offering one of those PROMO ads, so I had to go check it out.  After a short time I had decided which one was for me. It was an extra cab model with 4 doors.  I have 2 greyhounds which we have been known to haul around quite a bit.  The easy open rear doors made loading  quite simple, a genius design.
     The truck so far was not a problem, it was the high pressure salesman.  He was very new and very young.  I told him I could not buy it that day.  I had to let my wife see it, afterall she would be driving it the most.  We decided that a take-home was the answer.  
     After my wife, my friend, and I driving the truck most of that evening we had all noticed one major problem, POWER.  There was none.  I could not justify buying a new vehicle which did not have as much power as my 11 year old Toyota (still running.)
     After worked the next day I returned the truck and told the guy I still wasn't sure. Only time would tell this story.  After 3 days I realized I didn't miss the truck at all.  I am glad I waited. Afterall it makes no sense to pay 5 years for something you aren't happy with.<br><br>
