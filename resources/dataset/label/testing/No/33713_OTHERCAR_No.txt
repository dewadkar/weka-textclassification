            This is my third digital camera.  As the price of technology drops, I keep upgrading.  First a 1 MP than a 2 MP. I still use the earlier digitals, each of the three have their advantages.
I wanted the additional pixels to have the "latitude" that my Vivitar 3665 didn't afford me.  If you crop a 2MP photo too much and still print a 3x5 print of the remains of that photo the pixelation can definitely show.  With 5 MP that issue is gone, but with this camera, others come up.

The feature list is too long to include, suffice it to say that every feature anyone other than a full professional would want is included, there is nothing my SLR can do that this camera doesn't have.  3X optical, 2X digital zoom will get you very close to your subject.  If you are already close to your subject, the macro setting will take care of that. A reasonably bright preview screen will show you your photo before and after you take if you want.  If you are not satisfied, you can delete a photo and retake if you have time.

Setup is quick and easy, settings are kept if you replace the batteries quickly, so even the date and time are pretty accurate.

The camera was just too good a deal to pass up.  With most 3MP cameras going for $300 range, this 5 MP came in under $300 at a great sale.  I thought for this price it would be a long time before the competition would compare, so whatever shortcomings it may have would be worth it.  

This camera does almost all camera functions well.  With 5 MP, you would have to crop a photo to a small portion of the photo and then print at 8x10 or larger to notice pixelation, resolution is phenomenal.  

Unfortunately, color rendition is not what it should be.  If there are adjustments that will correct this on the camera, I haven't found them yet.  The poor color rendition means lots of correction in photoshop, and with a typical jpeg file size being close to a megapixel, that can take a while, especially if you don't have a relatively fast computer and lots of ram.

Another shortcoming is again a function of the file size.  A 2 MP camera will have a file size of 200-400 mb, less than half of the 5 MP.  All the information needs to be downloaded to the memory, in this case a compact flash.  Having read all the reviews available, I knew this took a while with this camera.  I thought if I got a faster flash card it would make up for it. It doesn't help nearly enough. Having upgraded from a 4x to 15x compact flash card made no noticeable difference, so that means it is a processor delay, not card writing delay that makes it so slow.  Unfortunately don't think there is anything that will ever cure that other than upgrading.

Buying bottom of the price range cameras means that I am willing to trade off some quality for features at a bargain price point.  My Kodak dc3200 1MP and Vivitar 2MP were not expensive cameras either in their time, but construction was much sturdier, white balance and color saturation were much truer than the argus. 

In addition to being slightly off color wise and slow to write to the CF, construction is not sturdy.  It is adequate for careful usage, but one review mentioned how the tripod mount was plastic and broken off early in the review.  I can foresee that happening with anything but careful use.  The battery door and cf card loading mechanism is are also poorly done, to the point of being "shoddy" in construction.  I do foresee breaking one or the other, my hope is by then other, higher quality 5 MP cameras will have come into the less than $300 price range so I can replace this and not miss it.
