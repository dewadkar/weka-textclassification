                In 1990, the two door convertible I owned was every thing I needed in a vehicle.  It could pull a small trailer, it was fun with the top down, got good gas mileage and a bonus... 4 wheel drive.
    Reliability and mileage were major high points, but driving comfort was a problem with the convertible model...  wind noise.  Highway driving might be the worst. This vehicles light weight made it lurch and swerve when being passed by large trucks, and crosswinds provided the same challenge.  Wintertime aggravated this problem as the heater was poorly suited to heat a vehicle with drafty, plastic windows.  
    Around town it is a nimble car to drive, but I would avoid, maybe even fear, long trips.  Besides, there is almost no luggage space, except when the back seat is folded.  I would say this vehicle would be best put to use on a college campus, or for short trips to the store.
    However, that was in 1990, and for all honesty, Chevrolet has been constantly improving the looks, features, and handling of these fun little 'trucks'.  I sometimes wish I still had mine.<br><br>
