            Working with about 20 different kinds of digital cameras every day, I have found the Fuji 1200 to be a horrible shot.  Our printed pictures (on photo paper with the HP Photosmart printer &lt;----high quality) came out yellow in color, with a thick fog/haze around everything, and nothing was in focus!  I do know how to take a picture, and we experimented with about 40 different pictures on so many different settings that I really don't think it was 'chance' that our pictures were so terrible.

But, we also have to take into consideration the price of the camera, which is at a low $240, a great price for a digital, and the ease of use.  The Fuji has an excellent user-friendly navigation system allowing you to take, edit and erase pictures as needed.  These are the ONLY good things about this camera, however.<br><br>
