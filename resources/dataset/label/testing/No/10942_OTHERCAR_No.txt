            The BMW is a great car to drive, but the engineers need to get real with their interiors.  I've never seen anything that cheap-looking in a car that costs that much in my life.  I would recommend the VW Passat/Audi A4 over it, but I'm partial to rear wheel drive, which, unfortunately, is not available with the VW/Audi.  I would also love to recommend the Mercedes C280 (a car that I own), but the exterior styling is a little dated and it can't be bought with a manual transmission (although, I have to say that the 5 spd automatic isn't bad for an automatic).  I wavered back and forth between the 328 and C280, and I just couldn't buy a car that I couldn't stand to look at from the inside.<br><br>
