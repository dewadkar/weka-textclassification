                 This GM great is at a crossroads. Sales of this sports car have been on the decline, to say the least. It is officially on of GM's slowest sellers. Dealerships are begging you to take them. So now GM must make a decision, whether to discontinue the dying sports car or to make some radical designing measures.
     
     I hope that they decide to continue the Camaro but they need to make some must have adjustments. First of all, the Camaro is just too bulky to be nimble. I mean some of GM's minivans are smaller. It needs to be at least a half-meter shorter. Then it would take on turns like a mad man. And the reliability is going to hell on this model. Mine broke down almost a month after I bought it. Not all of the Camaro�s declining sales is her fault though. People now are avoiding the high insurance prices of a sports car with such low reliability, especially if there is a young male driver in the family. The only car to avoid this problem is Camaro�s archenemy, the Ford Mustang. I will not get into length about the Mustang, but in my opinion it is a far superior car. Also, there is almost a non-existent back seat for the Camaro. And no baggage room to speak of, the Mustang has an abundance of both however (yet I digress, for I said I would not speak of the Mustang). Better shocks on this car could also be some great help. 

     Remember the Camaros of the 70�s? Good neither do I. But I�ve seen them around and they were a lot better than the Camaros of this age. GM what happened? Where did the magic go? All I have to say is �Fix it!!!!�. All things aside the Camaro is a fun car to drive. All you have to do is ignore the reliability problems, the size, the amount of room, the insurance and the fact that there is a better car out there (give you a hint it rhymes with Gord Mustang).
