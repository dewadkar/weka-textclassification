            AVIS=GM=dull and boring.
At least, that was what I thought when I received the keys to the Impala.  My opinion of GM cars would be altered somewhat.  

Test Period
I rented the Impala for 3 weeks in late '00.  Drove it to work in hot weather, cold weather, rain, wind, fog.  I was fortunate? to have rented two separate cars in the same trim, in different conditions.

Outside - 
In Green or White, the Impala has an aggressive look for a family sedan.  The sloping front nose and flat trunk lid give the car a sporty impression.  

Inside - 
Why does chevrolet make a car that tries to appeal to the young and restless on the outside, then give it an interior that is so sedate it would seem more appropriate in a buick?  The fake wood trim on the dash, bench seats, column shifter.  

The large speedo is flanked by smaller fuel gauge and warning lights.  (I think in the 3.8L the fuel gauge sits with the lights and a tach sits in its place.)  The large fuel gauge is in 16th increments, which came in handy when trying to return the car as empty as possible.  

The fabric seats became hot and uncomfortable on long trips.  Also, the bench seat offers little side support, and its height cuts headroom significantly.  

Engine-
The 3.4L is listed at 180hp.  It feels nice and strong in the low and mid range, but there's very little reward for wringing the engine.  The engine bay looked roomy and clean, making access easy for home mechanics.  Both cars started easily, even in freezing weather.  

Driving-
Around town and in parking lots, the car handles like a smaller car thanks to its low-end power and good power steering.  Hitting the highway, the car seems to hit a flat
spot in its power band at about 50 mph then downshifts and accelerates if you stay on the gas.  If it had better seats, it would be comfortable on the highway.  There is little engine or wind noise at 80mph.  Trying to push this car through a tight twisty road is a chore, and there is noticeable torque steer to fight under throttle.  The brakes are adequate but not particularly powerful - falls in line with the rest of the car.  The fleet equipment tires offered adequate grip in wet or dry. 

The car seemed adequate in night driving.  The lights were not noticeably bright nor dim.  

Amenities -
Both cars had an in dash CD.  The AC works well in hot or cold weather.  The interior light was difficult to find (it is located in the rearview mirror).  The trunk is large, and the large opening made it easy to load/unload.

Quality - 
The two cars had 8.5k and 21k miles, respectively.  The latter car had squeaky brakes, and seemed to be slower.  
The fit and finish is about what you might expect for a car in this price range.  In the second car, the spare tire was apparently used by a previous renter, and the trim did not set back properly.  

Overall -
This car does not do anything particularly well.  Nor does it have any glaring deficiency.  I'm sure that there are many people out there that will be pleased with a car like this.  I'd be curious to see how it might drive after a few years - but not enough to buy one.
