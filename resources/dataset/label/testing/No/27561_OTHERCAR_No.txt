            I had this car for 3 years as a lease, and in this time period I had kept the car in excellent condition, I had the Classic version with the tinted windows, fancy rims, premium sound system.  This car is a joy to drive, it does not drive very smooth, the engine is loud, but it gives you that superior feeling, and plenty of power to handle any road conditions I had to deal with.  I never really went off road with this car, but I did go on dirt roads, and trips that might have caused a normal car some damage.  The car does not have many luxury items (that is where the grand cherokee comes in), it has power windows, and an AC (not climate controlled) but other than that it is pretty bare bones.  The seats are ok, but can get uncomfortable on long trips.

The good:
This car has done me well when driving in Boston during a winter storm, it's 4 wheel drive is very good for bad weather situations, it also has plenty of power to spare.  The car frame is solid, and has plenty of cargo space for the average person.  I also like the looks of the car, it might not be impressive, but looks good none the less.  The buttons and controls in this car are all solid and feel mechanical, not electrical which give it that rough feel.

The bad:
This car will cost you enough money in the long run on gas that you could probably afford a BMW.  The thing that amazed me the most was that after only one year the muffler started to rust which I think should not happen anywhere near one year.  There also was a problem after two years where one of the front fans started to die on me.  Around the same time a piece on the 4wheel drive link broke and had to get it replaced.  All these repairs were under warranty, but it should still not have happened.  The seats are a bit uncomfortable on long trips.
