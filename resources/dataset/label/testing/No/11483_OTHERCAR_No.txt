            I bought a new Saturn in 1995. Within 6 months: transmission filter leaked, drivers' side mirror wouldn't adjust, hood latch release broke, dome light broke. At 30000 miles but 4 months out of warranty, alternator failed. At 44000 miles, an electronic gizmo which shifts the transmission failed. Total cost of both items: $800. When I called customer service requesting that they pay for the transmission problem, they told me 'tough luck'. I called a friend who had also purchased a new 1995 Saturn, and he had the same transmission failure that I had, but just before the warranty ran out. In addition to the above problems, the dome light has been 'repaired' 3 times, and broke again. When it rains, water comes through something under the dash. Saturn: long on hype, short on reliability. If you buy the car, you'd better buy the extended warranty, you'll need it.<br><br>
