            At first look, Nikon Coolpix 775 is very compact, light weight, and properly designed to fit into your hand.  Of course it's for right-handed.  So left-handed may have to think twice before buying.  You can easily operate the camera with one hand only.

I especially like the lifetime of the camera, I can take as much as 100 photos without changing the battery, with constant photos viewing via LCD.  Transfer of photos is very ease with Windows XP, actually it's plug and play and you don't even need to install the driver provided by Nikon, Windows XP can recognize it straight away.

Nikon Coolpix 775 comes with several preset scene modes.  You can also set a few setting like white balance and exposure yourself.  However, as most people say, it's not enough for professional.  For beginner, the preset scene is useful, but I prefer more other scene mode that is not include in 775, but in Nikon Coolpix 885, such as Fireworks.

The camera use Compact Flash card, which may not be common in the future.  If you plan to use your digital camera's memory card across many devices, then you better opt for other camera which use SD card.  CF card is famous for its slowness, as demonstrate in the camera.  Besides, start up the camera is slow, so do photos taking.

Overall the camera gives good quality photos. However, in some printout I notice that the colour of the human face is a bit different from printout from normal film, it's a bit pale here.
