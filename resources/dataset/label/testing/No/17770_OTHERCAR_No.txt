              We own a 1995 SL1.  We bought this car new, and for the first year we were the biggest sellers of Saturn's.  They were the best car in the world, the plastic side panels were wonderful and never cracked, the interior wasn't huge, but would certainly hold my husband, myself and a baby.  By 1997 the reality that Saturn was a different kind of car really hit home.  The car had problems, and we would call the dealerships in the area to get told that they couldn't help us for at least 2 weeks, but usually 4-6 weeks, and then they couldn't give us a loaner car as they were already assigned...how does that happen 4-6 weeks away and all the loaner cars are out?  The plastic does break, when the plastic gets cold it breaks very easily.  Our drivers door is broken, from us on a trip up north and we opened the door and bumped into a snow bank.  The car was still under warranty, but Saturn didn't want a thing to do with helping us with the door, they said it was impossible for it to break the way we said and that we must have had a car accident.  If we had I would have filed with my insurance company, had the door fixed.	
	As for the Saturn SL1 4 door being a family car, dream on.  Our baby seat really doesn't fit into the car well.  My husband and I both have to slide our seats forward a bit in order for it to fit right.  The seats which were supposed to be stain protected aren't at all, and the fabric really isn't holding up well.  I have taken may steps to try and keep the fabric in good shape but everyday wear seems to be too much for the car.  
	The idea of a plastic car is a good one but, if you get into an accident you still have to replace panels or at least have them buffed out and repainted like with a regular car.  
         When we first bought the car, it got about 28 miles to the gallon, and slowly over the years the gas mileage is down to about 24 miles to the gallon.  Also we were told that the oil would need to be changed between 3,000 and 5,000 miles, we have only once been able to go over the 3,000 mile mark since we bought the car.  If we go over the engine starts to click and we must add oil right away, as there is hardly any oil left.  
	We now know that the Saturn is really a different make of car!<br><br>
