            I have a 1996 Rodeo.  I have had no luck with it.  As far as handling, well you have to hang on to the steering wheel,  for any bump sends it off on another track.  the suspension squeaks, and has from day one.  The dealer tells they do not hear it.  My Rodeo sounds like an old rickety truck going down the road.  I like the size of this vehicle,  and that other maintenance is easily taken care of.  But I would not hand it down to my teenage daughter.  I hear that 1998 Rodeo changed a great deal,  but what about the 2000 model?  There a lot of Rodeos on the roads.  I have talked to people who have the year model that I have and they have never had a problem.  I believe I got a lemon,  but the dealership would never acknowledge this.  I'm afraid to try another Rodeo.  I guess I'll try a 2000 though.  I would keep mine now,  but it has to many problems and I don't have the time for problems.
