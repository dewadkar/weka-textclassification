            The original front brake rotors in my 2000 Oldsmobile Alero (3.4L GLS) have worn out far before they should have.  And GM, who knows about the widespread brake rotor problem, refuses to cover the defective parts under warranty.

Aside from that, I've been happy with the Alero.  It's a fairly typical, kind-of compact sedan.  If you're not all that enthusiastic about style or power or handling (and I'm not being sarcastic here: not everyone wants a car to drag race with), the Alero will probably be just fine in most regards.  It serves a basic function: to be a car that you drive from place to place.  But components of the 1999-2000 Alero were poorly manufactured, and will break down on you.  And if widespread part defects spring up commonly on a 2000 automobile, then be wary of more important component defects in the future.

Currently, the most complained-about component of the 2000 Alero is the front brake rotors.  From what information I have now found in newspapers and on the Internet (for example, http://www.alero.org/tsb.htm or http://www.edmunds.com/used/2000/oldsmobile/alero/4drglssedan/prices.html), this is a common problem with the 1999-2000 Alero (and Pontiac Grand Am). GM now manufactures new brake rotors to use as replacements. 

However, the GM garage that I had my car fixed at (Walt Sweeney Pontiac, Cincinnati, OH) did not replace the faulty rotors, but merely machined them so that they won't squeal/pulsate severely. I called Oldsmobile to ask whether this was standard procedure, and whether I could have the new, safer brake rotors installed on my Alero: the customer service person I talked with said that the existing rotors are machined (made smooth) if it isn't *absolutely* necessary to replace them.

Everything I've read on the 2000 Alero's brake rotors indicates that they are substandard... there are even a few technical service bulletins out from GM about this (00-05-22-002A "Brake Rotor - Warranty Service Procedure," 00-05-23-002A "Front Disc Brakes - Pedal/Steering Wheel Pulsation"). I believe that the brake rotors are faulty and unsafe; GM, I think, knows this, and has updated their product.

I would like for GM to hold a recall and replace the brake rotors under warranty.  However, at the very least, when the brake rotors wear out, they should CERTAINLY be replaced with the new, more durable brake rotors, rather than merely machined.  When these faulty rotors are machined, you'll most likely be fixing them again when they wear out in a few months.
