            The Buick Park Avenue is a great car in terms of ride, comfort, features, power, etc. However, when you compare the reliability statistics of this auto to those of comparable class, this sedan falls short-badly. So, if money is no object and you don't mind having the ole' Buick in the garage from time to time, read on, because you'll probably like everything else that's to be said about this big American beauty.

Styling: THAT's a Park Avenue? If you've looked down through the decades of Detroit autos, you'll find a long history of Park Avenues. They used to be tremendously long, wide, and heavy. Oh, and every curve was 90 degrees give or take a couple. This new breed of Buick's not likely to bare any resemblence to the Buicks of the past, given its curvacious exterior, and beautiful new interior that's equally graced with curves and a finely styled dash (As opposed to the older models that sported yards of fake wooden paneling, Detroit's gone easy on this breed). This Buick, therefore, should please people who are looking for a formal look in a modern package.

Interior: The new Park Avenue comes with a multitude of features, like electronic air-conditioning with dual-temperature controls so that the passenger can stay at a different temperature than the driver. The radio is a 6-speaker system with radio/cassette and an optional CD player. The sound system, by the way, is pretty decent. The seats, in the Buick tradition, are quite soft and comfortable. Of course, power windows and door locks are standard, as are power seats, a remote trunk release, dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, and other amenities you'd find on a luxury car. 

Performance: The Park Avenue's performance is decent for a full-sized sedan, but nothing to write home about. It has a "3800" V-6 engine, which, in the past has been noted for excellent reliability and it puts out 205 horsepower. If you're the sporty type, consider buying a Park Avenue Ultra, which has the supercharged V-6 and 240 horsepower.

Driving: The ride is quite serene, with superb sound insolation. Since this car is built on the same platform as the Oldsmobile Aurora, its body rigidity is great, so you'll feel you're driving a very solid car with predictable maneuverability. Unlike the Buicks of the past, the ride is not so spungy as to destroy the feel of the road, or make the car wallow up and down over bumps. If you enjoy driving this car as much as I did, you'll be very pleased.

Safety/reliability, etc: Unfortunately, reliability reports on the Park Avenue are not encouraging. While Buick was building solidly built cars in the early and mid 90's, the new line, that started in '97 has consistently ranked below most imports and many domestic sedans in reliability. If you're looking for a car with good reliability, look elsewhere. In terms of safety, however, this Buick has done fine, just like her relatives. Dual airbags, ABS, a sturdy frame, and other features should make you and your family feel secure. Lastly, don't expect great fuel efficiency. It gets only 19 mpg in the city, though it improves to 30 on the highways.

A final word: While this sedan stacks up quite well against competitors of similar price ranges, reliability reserves my recommendation from giving this auto anything higher than 3 stars. While I'm impressed with the general engineering, Detroit should be ashamed that after almost 100 years it can't produce a car with a reliable transmission, electrical system, brakes, etc. (all of which, this car falls short). Unless GM catches up with the reliability of her Japanese rivals, I'm expecting to see a lot more Lexuses and Mercedes on the road that Park Avenues.
