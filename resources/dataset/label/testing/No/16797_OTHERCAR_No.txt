            Camaro:  The muscle car of the 90's.  What has happened to the Camaro, From 1990, they were great cars, fast, sleek, powerful.  Even when the new model of 93 came out, they were still fast, sleek, and powerful, in fact, they could out power most cars on the road, the z28 anyhow.  Then in 1998, they put the new body on, and it just didn't seem to me, to be a Camaro.  The body went from sleek and stylish, to looking like what a lot of other cars look like.  The front is no longer sporty, its all rounded, like an intrepid or something of that sort.  Under the hood it is still beautiful, pushing out the 5.7L V8, but it just isn't enough, especially for the price tag that comes along with it.  Now I love Camaro's, but I believe if Chevrolet really wanted, it wouldn't be discontinued.  If they went back to more sporty, and made it a little more affordable, I believe they would have a huge hit, but thats just my opinion.<br><br>
