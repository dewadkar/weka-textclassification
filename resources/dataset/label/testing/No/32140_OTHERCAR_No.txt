            I have owned a 1998 mitsubishi 3000 GT (base model) for a year.  I purchased it brand new with all options including leather and infinity sound system at a great price (with the 100K extended warranty).

Basically this car should have never been made.  Who puts a 160 HP v6 in a 3350 lbs car?.  It is very sluggish and slow off of the line.  Although I found good acceleration (compared to an escort)  in 3rd and 4th gears. At first suspension and handling seemed good but only if you are going straight.  It takes corners at higher speeds poorly for a high performance sports car.  Also, if you try to break around a corner, the breaks lock up.  I have had this happen to me three times all leading to accidents. By the way Anti-lock breaks are not even an option on the base model. My car didn't last long enough for me to test its engine reliability but many electrical parts had to be replaced within the first year.

The only thing going for this car is its looks.

Overall, I wouldn't even consider this a sports car.  It has a Galant engine, and lack of antilock brakes in such a heavy car makes it extremely unsafe.  It fits two people and maybe a duffle bag in the trunk. Don't even try to fit  a small suitcase in the trunk or a passenger in back seat (unless they are Yoga masters they will not fit); even small children complain. I learned my lesson, if you want a 3000 GT buy the VR4. Now I know why they discontinued this model.  It was one of the most unreliable and unsafe cars I have owned.<br><br>
