            Our family needed a new wintertime vehicle, and the Jeep Cherokee Sport seemed like just the thing.  How does it stack up? 

<b> Control</b>
When it comes to driving in snow and ice, this is probably one of the best choices in the price range.  Storm after storm it went without any major slides.  It accelerates well for an SUV also, and generally handles corners well for this type of vehicle.  On another note, it is rather thirsty, and often costs over $20 to fill the tank.

<b> Interior </b>
The cloth seats are some of the toughest I've ever sat in, and are a real pain for long trips.  This fits in with the rest of the rather spartan interior.  The back has sufficient legroom, but can feel tight when 3 people are sitting there.  Also, as a passenger I miss having an arm rest.  The front has sufficient room for driver and passenger.  Lots of engine noise can be heard when driving over 40 mph. The cargo space is adequate.  All in all, I can't say being inside, especially for long trips, is a pleasure.

<b> Looks </b>
I can't say you'd impress anybody with the looks of this, although some people are into them.

<b>Reliability</b>
Over 30,000 miles without a hitch.  Nothing more to say here.

All in all, a rugged, no frills vehicle.  If you don't live in an area that has lots of snow, I wouldn't recommend getting one of these.
