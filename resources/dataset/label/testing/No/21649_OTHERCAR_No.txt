            My hope is that this will help you make a decision on what is the best car for your money.  I am currently in the market for a new coupe.  So when I saw the commercials for the new acura 2001 CL, I had to include it in
my list of possibilities. 

My first impression of the car is .. wow.. it looks like the TL from the from.. but what is with the weird shaped back?  Haven't they fixed that yet.

I sat inside and noticed the dials for temperature control and said.. ok. if I'm going to pay anything over $25K for a car.. I want digital.. not dials.  I was told that I could get the digital temp. setting if I installed the navigation system which is the only available option on this car.  I was again disappointed by the lack of degree of tilt in the 
steering wheel but the BMW 3 series has the same problem.

Headroom was not sufficient for me in this car.. I am 5' 11&quot; and felt
that if I hit a bump I could easily be hitting the roof.  While we are 
on roof.. the sunroof carries two buttons. I am picky about that because I used to own a 86 Saab 9000 Turbo and it had one button to slide the roof back and the same button could be used to tilt the roof.  It's been 14 years.. I figured by now Acura should be able to copy the technology.  

In terms of maintenance.. Acura does offer a plan that allows you to pay for the maintenance up front.. it is something like $1365 which takes care of 36K miles worth of service.. rather interested granted that BMW / Audi / Saab include this maintenance for you as part of your purchase.

I also hoped this car would have a 5 speed manual transmission to give me the sporty feel I was looking for.. but it does offer that automatic / sport transmission.. which I wasn't too impressed with.

The car's ride was nothing to brag about.  It was quite though.  I didn't get a feel that I was riding in a sporty car which was disappointing.

The car does come with a lot of options: sunroof, leather, 6 disc changer in the dash (this is really nice), power driver/passenger seats, power locks/windows, garage remote control, trip A and B
   --- All of which I would expect for a car of this price range ----

Overall.. the car is a nice Honda.. I would NOT recommend it to my friends.  I do recommend that you go an test drive it though, after all one man's trash is another man's treasure.<br><br>
