            The vehicle rides well and handles nicely for a Sport Utility vehicle.
I am currently on my third engine in 150,000 miles.Engine no. 1 spun number two rod bearing at 131,000 miles.  I used synthetic oil and 3500 mile change intervals. Engine no. 2 blew the head gasket with 26,000 miles on it. Very disappointed but developing skill at replacing them. These are the same engines as used in the Dodge Caravans and are somewhat anemic in the power department. Off-road dexterity is good. Brakes are nothing to write home about and require frequent replacement.  Paint job is excellent.  Tires wear well. The truck has good ergonomics.  Accessories have held up well. I have added a 8k. Ramsey winch. Other than transportation, I use the vehicle off-road for surf fishing and traverse sandy beaches-mobility is good even without dropping air pressure in the tires.  <br><br>
