            My daughter-in-law just purchased a Kia Sephia 5 months ago.
 She only uses this car for work which is just a few miles away.
 Since she has gotten this car,she has had more problems with it. 

It is a 1999 car and it was bought brand new. She has received recall letters for everything from faulty windshield wipers to faulty brakes.She even ran out of gas once because the float in her gas tank was defective,and a new part was ordered 4 weeks ago, but can not be fixed because the repair shop is so booked ahead that she can't get an appointment which should tell you something about this product.

 When the car is put in reverse it sounds like a Mack Truck not a brand new car. This car was fixed 4 times and still runs awful.I hope this is just a bad lemon of a car, I would not want to see anyone else have as many problems as she has had especially when it cost over ten thousand dollars. 

She is thinking of getting rid of this car fast if it does not improve with the next round of trying to correct its problems.

Just wanted to update condition of her car now that it is 1 year old.
I have a 1987 Ford Escort that still runs and looks better.

If you could see this car now you would be shocked.
All the rubber around the doors have come off, she had to have her whole gas tank replaced because of problems with them.
It sounds worse then it did before and she is constantly having to get it fixed.

They told her if it breaks down one more time she they will consider it a LEMON.
Are they serious!!
This car has been towed twice and at $200 each tow, it is costing a fortune.
Of course she gets the money returned, but it takes forever and who wants to wait so long.

As soon as possible she is trading this bomb in and I assure you she will not get another no matter how good of a deal they try to hand her.
They have been trying to sell her another as they say she will never get a better deal from another, how true that is, she has gone to other car dealers and they wouldn't give her much for this car because they know the awful reputation this car has.

She wanted to run it to the ground, but who wants to get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a 4 year old son.
If it breaks down when she is alone she might consider using the lemon law, but would you chance it?

I think she would be better off if she either bought a used car from a different dealer and took her chances than to buy a new Kia and know what she is getting-A Big Problem.
