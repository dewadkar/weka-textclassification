            This was a birthday present last March right after I broke my IZOOM 75 Olympus Advantix Stylus (another crappy camera) in Florida whiles on vacation.

For my first Digi-Cam I was excited at first. The LCD was bright and crisp at 1.4 inches not 1.6 like the details imply. The controls were clear and easy to follow so in no time I was taking pictures. And in no time the fully charged AA batteries died! -After 10 to 15 pictures (about 7 taken with flash and zoom and the LCD was on for every picture taken)

The build quality of the camera is the equivalent to a plastic toy! Whiles I like the sort-of-small size and sleek exterior colors and button layout, the plastic body implies the camera couldn't have cost more than $10 to make and could not honestly be  sold for more than $70. 

There was no adapter in the box which sucked and I  tried my own universal adapter (like the other reviewer did) and the camera came on briefly then blacked out (exactly like what the other reviewer said). So I bought 20$ in duracell AA batteries and took the camera and 12 batteries on a day hike upstate NY.
Needless to say after 78 high resolution, fine quality outdoor pictures and 12 dead duracells (yes all 12 batteries died!!!) I was back home at my computer looking at the results.***

The pictures were clear and crisp with great detail and contrast for most shots under sunlight at avg. distance of 5-9 feet away. The digital zoom didn't work as I'd hoped- pictures that were zoomed came out blurry most of the time and seemed extra sensitive to both scene conditions and to whether the camera moved slightly when the shot was taken. The .AVI video footage came out really good and I think this is one of the biggest positives here. With the 3315 you can record as much video as the storage card can hold (I took about 2 minutes) or actually you can record as much video before the battery dies and it will after two minutes of recording. The video footage was brighter and clearer with better details than most of the pictures. There is no sound with the videos.

The playback and editing features were easy to use on the 3315 small LCD even though when the LCD is on the batteries dies quickly.

I can't recommend Vivitar 3315 for anyone who can spend $100 more than the price of this camera for something much better. 
I will say this though, if you want decent pictures and don't mind spending cash on batteries and you are determined to not spend more than 50-100$ for a digital cameras then this is the camera for you. 
Actually I should add a note on the battery: I haven't tried this but I heard Radio Shack sells rechargeable AA lithium batteries that last much longer than disposable duracells in Digital cameras.

** Duracell AA Batteries averaged out at one pair for 10-15 pictures with the LCD on 90-100% of the time and flash used 50-70% of the time.
