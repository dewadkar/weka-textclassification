            Reliability:

  I have owned this car for a little over 3 years now, and I have yet to have a mechanical problem with it. Besides oil changes, a new serpentine belt at about 50,000 miles, and a taillight that got broken, I haven't spent any money on it at all. The car now has 60,000 miles on it, and everything still runs reasonably well.

Quality:

  Mine is a coupe, but I happen to hate the way this car looks in the 4-door sedan model. The 2-door coupe however is okay-looking (especially if you are a teenage girl). The look of the headlights and grill are much improved in the 2000 models, however. As for the seating, same story. the seats in my 1998 model start to get uncomfortable after lengthy drive, but they are much improved and made of a nicer material in the 2000 and up models. Also, the position of the cupholders is changed so that a cup placed in them doesn't constantly bump the buttons on the radio (as happens in my car)

Engine & Drivetrain:

  What engine? I seriously do not believe GM with their assertion that this car (the 2.2L) puts out 120 horsepower. Even for the size and weight that this car is, it is seriously underpowered. Like the engine, the brakes are way too small for this car (and wear out quickly, I've read) and as the stopping distance leaves much to be desired. However the transmission is pretty smooth, and the Cavalier performs closer to how a real car would perform at lower speeds. The handling is above average, I never have a problem in the rain. However, the Antilock Brakes seem a little too touchy, as sometimes on a snowy day they kick in a little sooner than I'd rather, seemingly increasing stopping distance. The car does fairly well for low-traction environments. The ride is not very good - you really feel the potholes, and the engine is much louder than I would like.

Overall:

  Overall, I would say if you are considering this car in the first place, it is probably just right for you. By that I mean that if you are looking for an inexpensive entry-level car, and don't need any power whatsoever, this car might be right for you. Not recommended for someone who expects any kind of performance. Recommended for someone who just wants to get from point A to point B.

Pro:
-Good gas mileage
-Reliable 
-Handles well in rain and snow

Con: 
-Terrible brakes
-Engine some sort of a bad joke
-Cramped interior if you are more than about 5'10"
-Puny backseat
-A/C not the coldest
-Ride very rough, loud engine
