            I currently own a 1995 Hyundai Accent.  Purchased new in August of 95, I have since placed more than 107,000 miles on this little car.  The key word here being &quot;little&quot;.  So why did I buy it?  Well obviously it was a prestige thing.  No really, I needed a car and needed one right away.  After several bad &quot;used car&quot; experiences I had decided that new was the only way.  I am a salesman and as such, I log an excessive amount of miles. Had I spent more money on a luxury car, I'd still be paying on the loan with little value left to the car come time to buy a new one.  Just like my present car.  So I purchased this because it was inexpensive and provided good gas mileage.  Was it an accident buying an Accent?  Well, that is up for debate.  I can tell you this.  In the 107,000 miles I have required very little maint.  I replaced the rear struts and mounts at 65,000 miles which I felt was way too soon.  While doing a tune up I tried to remove the PVC valve which is threaded into the plastic valve cover gasket.  It was screwed in so tight that in trying to remove it, I cracked the cover.  A $150. part.  This is a frequent problem for this vehicle.  Oh yes, the valve cover gasket is $30.  The clutch is going at this time but that is acceptable as I do shift a lot.  Other than that, no problems mechanically.

The car fares well about town.  The clutch and gear shift is smooth and feels good.  It's easy to see all around and easy to park.  You sometimes feel crowded out by these yahoos in SUV's who haven't got a clue how to drive such a vehicle (nor do they really have a need for one) but otherwise with the handling, airbags and side impact protection, you can almost feel safe.

I am 6' and can sit fairly comfortable in this car as can my back seat passengers who care to risk their lives.  The car however is not comfortable for very long, say in excess of 5 or 10 minutes.  I find that because of the placement of the pedals and the middle hump, I tend to sit at an angle rather than straight on.  I do like the little foot rest for my left foot when it comes off the clutch.  

Why do the side mirrors fade from black to white?  Good question.  Let me know if you come up with that answer.  I for one don't like the look.

If you do a lot of highway travel and exceed 55 mph you may want to bring some hearing protection with you.  The sound of the motor and road noise is ridiculous.  I suspect that the motor is turning at approximately 3500 rpm's between 55 and 60mph and it gets worse at 65 obviously.  But it has great passing speed.

This vehicle is too small for me as a salesman but it may be good for you.  Unless of course you have a large family of 2 or more.

Was it an accident buying this car?  As I said, I am still undecided.  Would I rather drive the Hyundai Accent instead of a BMW, Lexus or car of like status?  You betcha!  I'll pay cash for my Hyundai while you lease or take out a loan for your idiot mobile.  Then I will invite you over for a weekend at my home on the lake and tell you about my investment portfolio.  So what is my next car?  Probably a 1986 Chevy Celebrity Eurosport Station Wagon.  Now there is a car if you can find one without rust!

Oh yeah, the digital clock ($65.) died.<br><br>
