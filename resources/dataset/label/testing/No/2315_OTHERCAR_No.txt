                 Well to get to the point from the start I would have to say this vehicle is just to get around in.  It is not built for comfort or long distance driving.  

     Mine is a 1999 Sephia sedan with no amenities.  The steering is a bit tight for a small car and the engine can be heard above 55.  It is small for my build, I am 6'2&quot; and 280.  The manual transmission is unusual to handle as well.  Unlike most American autos I have driven, the gear ratio seems to be a bit out of wack.  The first gear is to low and second to high.  They would have been better off finding the in-between of first and second and making it a 4 speed.  The metal shell is so thin the you can dent it with your finger tip and the paint is so thin you can scratch it with a finger nail.  I bought it new and instead of the usual new car smell it took two months for me to air out the smell of the cheap glue.

     Now for the good side of this auto.  One of the main reasons I bought this auto was for the price and economy of fuel consumption.  In both these areas I am satisfied.  I live in the Puget Sound area of Washington state and the highways are much like anywhere else I am sure.  I do a mix of highway and city driving and average 32 miles to a gallon.  I got a bit ripped off on the finance charge, but hey my credit was not all that good either.  I pay 225 a month on a 60 month contract and for me that is reasonable.  I Have had no problems with the automobile and am pleased with that part of it.  It cost me 8245.00 with a spoiler on the trunk, which I think is made out of plastic.  This automobile as I purchased it should cost 8170.00 so the dealership did not stick it to me too bad.  I have looked it up on the Kelly blue book and as it is it now has a value of 6750.00.  

     Overall I would rate this vehicle in two ways.  If you are looking for something to travel short distances, want good mileage and willing to sacrifice comfort for low price this auto is a good deal.  If you travel long distance or like comfort, I would say to avoid this auto.    <br><br>
