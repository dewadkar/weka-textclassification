            My father purchased a 2001 Mercury Villager upon retiring, and I have had the chance to drive and evaluate it several times since then. I was first impressed by the very attractive dark blue metallic paint in a one color scheme, without any silver or grey lower body accents. The fit and finish on this vehicle looked to be exceptional, and the overall styling makes it one of the best looking mini-vans on the market.

Once behind the wheel, one comes to admire the very well thought out interior and dash layout, with all controls easy to reach and fairly simple to use. The engine starts quickly and is very quiet, but driving this thing is another matter!

The throttle is far too touchy, often causing the van to leap forward from a stop with only slight pressure on the pedal. Fuel injected engines do not share the smooth and precise feel of carbureted engines, but some auto makers do a far better job with them than THIS! Performance from the V6 engine is pretty impressive, but the mushy and irregular shifts from the automatic transaxle ruin the full effect.

Ride quality is pretty harsh compared to other mini-vans that I've driven, yet the stiff ride somehow fails to offer anything but sloppy handling. The van experiences a significant amount of body roll in quick cornering as the tires howl in protest. I'm not talking about running a slalom course here, I'm talking about turning the vehicle sharply at moderate speeds around town! The van doesn't feel as if it will roll over easily, but handling falls far below what I would expect from a small vehicle with such a stiff suspension.

On the road, the stereo system provides good sound quality for a factory package, and the climate control system keeps the occupants in comfort through all seasons. The seats are comfortable enough for average commutes, and the dual sliding doors and adjustable seating positions are very nice features which enhance the utility aspects of this vehicle.

In all, this vehicle offers some nice features at competitive prices, and is one of the best looking vehicles in it's class. The fit and finish, along with overall quality are excellent, and the interior is very nicely laid out. However, the touchy throttle, mushy transmission and poor suspension make driving this attractive vehicle less than pleasant. 

Know what you are buying before you spend your money. This is simply a re-badged Nissan Quest, and NOT a product of the Ford Motor Company. In my opinion, Ford is more than competent enough to build their own small mini-van with a better engine and transaxle, and I would welcome the return of the rear wheel drive Aerostar anytime over THIS vehicle! If interested in this vehicle, compare prices at both your Mercury and your Nissan dealer for the best deal. I personally would recommend the Kia Sedona as a better alternative in the small mini-van market, but some folks may still be sold on this vehicle's attractive styling and may not mind it's shortcomings.
