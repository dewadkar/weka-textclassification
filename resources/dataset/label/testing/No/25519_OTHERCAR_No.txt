            Along about 1994, Mazda Motor of America, Inc. decided to increase the quantity of  passenger cars imports by allowing (for lack of a better term) Ford to build the all &quot;NEW&quot; B-series truck, and new it was.  Ford built a good product for Mazda if you spent the extra money and purchased the B4000 series.  Unfortunately, the B3000 and B2300(Pinto Motor) were not up to the quality that one would expect from a Japanese company.  O.K. enough said about a bad decision.  The Maz/ford, as I affectionately call it, is overall a good product.  The vehicle substantiates its claims by providing a vehicle with a lot of power, roomy interior, and a lot of extras.  However, if your looking for a vehicle that is not to easy on the pocket book, looks good, but drinks a little too much gas, then this trucks for you.<br><br>
