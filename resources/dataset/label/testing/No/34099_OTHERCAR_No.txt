            I am a very experienced professional mechanic, I have been working on all makes of foreign and domestic cars for 41 years.  I have all my own tools and shop.  Based on this experience I bought a 1992 Lincoln Continental for 3,000.00 dollars.  It had 149,000 miles so I expected some problems.  I knew I would need to replace the tires, brakes, air ride struts and possibly a few other astetic items.  The transmision went out and took the engine with it less than 500 miles later.  I installed a Fred Jones(Ford)factory rebuilt engine and AXOD transmission. I replaced the mounts,harmonic dampner, injectors, water pump, oil pump,flywheel,starter,serpentine belt, idler pulley, thermostat,hoses,and had the radiator checked at a reputable radiator shop.  I also replaced the air ride struts,tires, air ride compressor, A/C compressor, Accumulator drier and flushed sytem, evacuated system and recharged.  All of this was done in July of 2000.  One would tend to believe that all was well.  Wrong!!!! This car continued to give me more and more problems.  I replaced the power steering pump and repaired the lines.  These steel lines run directly under the LH exhaust manifold and are subjected to tremendous heat, it boils the fluid.  The Digital dash is still giving me trouble with the CHECK DCL and intermittent or split temp guage readings.
On May 15, 2001 the engine seized and locked up.  I had 18,000 miles on the engine and transmission.  It took Ford over 4 weeks to agree to replace the engine and they would not pay for the labor as I had exceeded the 12,000 miles that included labor.  I was quoted $1,000.00 labor to R & R the engine.  I had back surgery in October of 2000 and can no longer do the work myself.  I had Rountree-Moore Ford in Lake City, Florida do the work(this is where it broke-down) They installed the engine and informed me that the A/C compressor was bad.  I had them replace it and get a new one under warranty from the supplier.  When I went to pick up the car the vehicle was a mess.  The A/C did not work, compressor would not come on due to low freon charge.  The radiator was low on Antifreeze/coolant and the fan was not bolted to the radiator.  The power steering lines were leaking and the car now had a major exhaust leak.  At wits end I again left the car with them.  The dealer called and said the evaporator was leaking(it wasn't leaking when the engine blew) and that the radiator needed to be replaced.  After many arguments and phone calls to the General Manager and service manager we finally comprimised that they would do the A/C work(Condensor, liquid line, evaporator,2nd new compressor, 2nd new accumulator/drier)at their cost.  I still believe their incompetent technicians busted the evaportor coil.  When I finally picked the car up on June 25, 2001 it still had exhaust leaks. I took the car anyway and drove it to Ft. Lauderdale, Fl.  On the way back to N. Florida the A/C quit cooling.  Upon close inspection I found that the dealer had improperly installed the wiring harness to the compressor and pinched the wires between the power steering pump brackets and the engine.  When this short was repaired the compressor still would not come on.  Further diagnosis revealed that the Automatic Temperature Control Module in the dash was burnt out on the compressor circuit only, the module checked out internally and by bypassing the module compressor clutch circuit with a manual switch I was able to engage the compressor and the rest of the module functions are fine.  I had to get my lawyer to threaten a legal action to get them to replace the module they shorted out and ruined.  It has not yet arrived(July 25,2001).  I have since replaced the mirror control switch, a window motor, seat motor, door lock motor, and cannot buy a headliner for the car as Ford says they are obsolete.  The digital dash still acts up.  I replaced the radio/tape player as the original quit working, and the car now pulls to the right as the Ford dealer would not re-align the front end after engine/subframe removal, I will have to do this at my cost again.  Also the rack and pinion has some play and the cost for the power steering line kit which includes: heat shields, a pressure line and return line costs $160.00 and I have to install it or pay Ford's outrageous labor of $70.00 per hour.  I have more money in this car than it is worth and would like to believe I could drive it for a few years.  But alas it is so poorly designed and manufactured that even Ford won't back up their work or parts.  It is a pathetic dissappointment for me.  I cannot afford to buy something else.  The response from Ford Motor Company and its dealers concerning this automobile is contemptible.  I will never again own a Ford product and highly reccommend that everyone stay away from the Lincoln Continental.  It is a nightmare.  My teenagers call the car "Christine II" as it will eat all your money and will not let you ride very long before it breaks again.  Avoid these cars at all cost. If someone gives you one for free, it will cost you to have it hauled to the junkyard/crusher where it belongs. My co-workers call it the car with the black cloud.
