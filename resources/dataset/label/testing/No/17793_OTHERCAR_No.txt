            I currently drive this van for work, and I have been for the past year, so I can tell you a bit about it.

PRO - HANDLING:
Good steering and handling.  Has great acceleration.  Whenever I go on the highway I can get it up to 70 in about 8 seconds, which isn't that bad for hauling flowers around.  The gas pedal works good, and doesn't make the van "jump" or "rocket" like some other vehicles.

PRO - GAS USAGE:
One good point is the gas milage.  I usually drive around 120 miles each day.  When I have the tank filled, after a day of driving, the needle doesn't go anywhere.  I get it filled when it reaches 1/4 tank which is usually only once a week.  So we have to give credit there.

CON - HIGH MAINTAINENCE:
Thank heaven I don't have to foot the bill!  My boss has had over $2000 in repairs since I started working there.  Ok you're probably all pointing fingers at me.  Well we had about 5 other drivers at the florist who used, and abused this vehicle left and right.  

But even things that the most destructive person couldn't affect went wrong.  The AC hasn't worked since day one.  My boss got it fixed twice and each time it failed a week later.  All it does is blow out hot air (not unlike my boss).

Another problem with handling is that it shakes constantly even at speeds as slow as 30-35 MPH.  Now I dont know if this was a problem caused by one of the drivers or if they all get like that.  The van has only 99K miles and it had 72K when I started working.  99K miles isn't much when you consider that a business had it for years and that it is used regularly.  But it shouldn't have to be serviced constantly.

Most of the other problems were more of annoyances than threats to safety.  One noteworthy thing however is that when you first use the breaks after it has been sitting all night, they jerk very hard until after the van has been in use for about 10 minutes.  And even so, they break too hard after that.

OVERALL
I would say its a good van if you're doing local business.  Its got plenty of room and will serve well to the junk collector (like myself).
