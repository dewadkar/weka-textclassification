            For the 2003 model year, Infiniti has decided to replace its overpriced, underpowered G20 with the all new G35.  That being said, the G35 is a totally new model and shares nothing with the discontinued G20.  The G35 was designed to compete with the German sports sedans like the BMW 5 series the Audi A4.  Infiniti has done a remarkable job with the G35 and almost comes close to perfecting the sport sedan category that German automakers have perfected over the years.


The G35 comes standard with Nissan's award winning 3.5 DOHC V6 which is the same basic powerplant that powers many of their vehicles, such as the Maxima, Altima, and Pathfinder.  The 260hp V6 sends power via the rear wheels like a true sport sedan always should.  The G35 is a fast car for its size, with 0-60 time of around 6.5 seconds.  Nissan Motor Corp. has really pushed the bar of performance with the variations of its 3.5 V6.  This engine easily outpowers the competition in its class.  The engine will truely amaze you once you get behind the wheel.

All this power would be worthless if the G35 couldn't handle like a sport sedan.  Infiniti seems to have created a good balance with the G35's suspension characteristics.  The car felt very comfortable taking hard corners during spirited driving, yet it still has a smooth ride during high speed cruising and soaks up all the bumps of the road.  The G35 felt very comfortable at high speeds as I did have it up to 105MPH and it acted and felt like I was still going 75.  While the noise level isn't tomb-quite like Lexus, it is above average and should satisfy most consumers.  

When talking about exterior looks, one has to remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I personally like the exterior design of the G35.  Its shape is smooth and rounded like a small version of the Lexus GS serious.  The front end, however, does not have the agressive look of most sports sedan with the Honda Civic like round headlights.  Other than that, the G35 has an attractive exterior design that should able to most people.  

The interior of the G35 was not up to par for a car of this class.  The interior material quality was poor for a luxury brand like Infiniti and does not compare to competitors such has Lexus or Acura.  The instrument panel was also somewhat hard to read in sunny conditions due to its orange colors.  Interior room is very good however due to the cars slopeing roofline the rear passengers had ample room as did the front passengers.  I personally found the HVAC and radio controls and bit small and confusing, but this could be due to myself being used to Lexus controls.  But overall, the interior dissapointed me.

The G35 will be priced around the $30k-35k range depending on the equipment level you select.  I find the G35 to be a good value considering its superior performance, and handling and ride qualities.  But it looks like some serious cost-cutting was done in the interior to keep the price down on the G35.  Before you consider buying this vehicle, consider other models within the Nissan family.  The Maxima has nearly the identical engine and power of the G35 and does it with a lesser price which ranges from $23k-28k.  What the Maxima gives up in handling, it makes up for with better interior room.  Also, the Nissan Altima has the same 3.5V6 has the Maxima and G35(but only 240hp) and it is very similar to the G35 in handling and ride and undercuts the G35's price by $5k-7k.  It all comes down to getting a good value for your money and I would consider the Maxima and Altima if your considering buying the G35.
