               When you first set eyes on funky looking 2003 Baja you can't help but think of the infamous 'Brat' Subaru once produced during the early-mid 1980s. Both of these car/truck like vehicles are based on a passenger car platform; the Subaru Legacy/Outback's platform in the Baja's case. While the Brat boasted a unique character, it was slow, unsophisticated, and uncomfortable. The all new Baja, introduced as a 2003 model, still retains much of these negative attributes, however there is no denying that this new addition in Subaru's 2003 model line-up is far superior from the infamous Subaru Brat.

For the 2003 model year the Baja comes in no trim lines, and 1 body style; an AWD 4 door vehicle with a truck like bed instead of a trunk (<a href="/content_67772321412"> Cars.Com</a> claims Subaru markets this vehicle as an 'open bed sports sedan'). Instead of using the horizontally opposed 6 Subaru offers in many of their vehicles, Subaru has opted to use the even more popular SOHC 2.5 liter horizontally opposed 4-cylinder rated at 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque as the Baja's sole power plant. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual and a smooth shifting 4-speed fully automatic (equipped in tester).

<b>Note:</b> A few sources suggest that Subaru may produce a 6 cylinder powered Baja for the 2004 model year.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  While not exactly languid, 'exciting' is the last thing that comes to mind after driving the new 2003 Subaru Baja. With its 2.5 liter 4-banger pumping out a mere 165 horses and a plump curb weight of almost 3,600 lbs, one can expect more of a grocery getter like experience than anything else. Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is adequate, but this vehicle begs for more power. The 2.5 horizontally opposed engine in the Baja is used in a variety of Subaru vehicles, yet seems to be lacking the most giddy-up in the Baja, the heavy curb weight obviously plays a big role here. A 6-cylinder, or perhaps even a WRX powertrain set-up would be an interesting addition for this vehicle, and no doubt would make for a much more exciting ride. Like most 4-cylinder engines, the Baja does have its undesirable 4-cylinder exhaust/engine whine on take-off, this however can be avoided by keeping the engine under 4,000 RPM. Another common 4-cylinder characteristic I found with the Subaru Baja's 2.5 is relatively rough idling. While not too bothersome, the Accord's 4-cylinder, the 2003 Sentra's 4-cylinder, the PT Cruiser's 4-cylinder, and even Subaru's own WRX's engine all seemed much more capable of keeping their cabins vibration free at idle. I was expecting much more refinement from Subaru in this department. Torque steer is eliminated thanks to AWD, and taking off from a standing start is smooth going, never getting steered off track like many FWD cars do with large amounts of torque, i.e the Nissan Sentra. The 4-speed fully automatic transmission shifts seamlessly without any clunks or hesitation whatsoever. When shifting from 'D' down to '3' or vice versa the transmission stays composed, never jolting, stalling, or slipping.

 Even though the 2003 Baja looks somewhat like a truck, it handles much more like a small car. <b>Handling</b> is excellent. Taking to the turns is just as impressive as with the regular Legacy. Subaru's excellent AWD system obviously plays a huge role in the Baja's ability to be such a good handler. Tires include standard wide 225/60R 16s which aid in grip, and offer good use when driving through sand, and beach brush. Shallow sand, and poorly maintained gravel roads are probably the only place 'off-road' you'll be able to take the Baja. Since there is no underplate, and since this vehicle sits about as low as the Legacy, climbing rocks through rocky mountain off roads, or the Moab outback is not happening if you want your exhaust to stay intact. Max towing capacity of the Baja is only 2,400 lbs which further suggests that this vehicle is not your typical heavy duty truck.

Despite the Baja's public image as a beach comber, it finds it's home on the freeway/smooth surfaces more than anywhere else. Even though the Baja is rated at only 165 horses, it moves through town and at freeway speeds with little effort. At 65 MPH the tach in the Baja reads about 2,500 RPM, this suggests that the Baja has a very tall top gear, especially for an automatic. This tall gearing has its advantages and disadvantages. I'll get to the disadvantages later. Since the automatic is tall geared, cruises on straight stretches between 60-65 MPH are extremely hushed; no engine noise at all while in high gear between 60-65 MPH. Rattles, wind, and roadgrain noise are also all kept to a minimum. The ride is firm but not overly so, most road imperfections are kept isolated from the cabin. Since the Baja is so tall geared, its steep inclines that really make the Baja an annoyance. The transmission remains smooth at almost all times, however it needs to shift almost constantly on inclines to maintain a decent highway speed. Even on slight overpasses the transmission will down-shift into 3rd gear, and when it is shifted into 3rd gear the Baja still is not so great at tackling steep grades. If you live in steep mountainous areas this vehicle is probably best avoided. This engine is my only major gripe with this vehicle's powertrain. Subaru could increase power by at least 20% here to help accommodate the Baja's mass, either that or ditch the 2.5 and make Subaru's slant 6 standard, or perhaps, as I mentioned before, a WRX set-up for the same price as the already steep MSRP of the 2.5 liter powered Baja. 

<b>Major Gripe:</b> At 65 MPH with the sunroof down it sounds like  you are driving through a hurricane. While a wind deflector might fix this problem, it would also make the roof racks useless. 

 With 4-wheel disc brakes coupled with 4-wheel ABS <b>braking</b> was excellent. No fade whatsoever when coming to a panic stop in the Baja, nor did the Baja have that sometimes present shake in the steering wheel when coming to a sudden stop.    

<b>Fuel economy</b> is average. Oddly, the automatic transmission has a higher EPA than the 5-speed manual. This most likely is due to the tall gearing of the automatic. The EPA rates the automatic Baja at 21/26 which puts this vehicle's MPG rates in the same category with the  PT Cruiser, Ford Explorer, and the Dodge Caravan. While real world specs might be more than what the EPA suggests, the EPA of the 4-cylinder powered Baja should be much more forgiving.


<i>Interior/Accommodation:</i>



The <b>interior,</b> by far, is the the Baja's strongest asset. When you settle yourself in the comfortable two toned Baja embroidered leather trimmed perforated seats and the color matching leather steering wheel, you come to the conclusion that this interior was designed for comfort, durability, and  practicality. The Baja uses a slight amount of titanium accents, however Subaru has steered clear of being tacky by using too much of this theme. The dash is very user friendly with easy access to the HVAC controls, and easy on the eyes blue colored instrument gauges. While not loaded to the brim with embellishments, the Baja is about on par with luxury items you would expect from a car with the Baja'a base sticker price of almost $24,000. Some standard amenities include a decent sounding 6-speaker 80 watt AM/FM stereo single CD system, dual front air bags, 6-way power drivers seat, leather wrapped automatic gear shifter, compass, illuminated ignition, power sunroof with tilt, tilt steering, power everything, and much more. Both <b>Cars.com</b> and <b>Subaru.com</b> have much more info on standard and optional equipment available with the Baja. The use of quality plastics are used throughout the cabin, unlike many cars such as the Altima, or Chevy Impala which use 'toy like' plastics that are flimsy and seem very prone to breakage. The map pockets seem sturdy, and the plastic moldings on the doors all seem fitted well. 

Seating in the Baja is good. Subaru could have improved on the bolstering of the leather bucket seats, but as they stand they are adequately comfortable and supportive. The 6-way power drivers seat is a convenient standard feature, and allows for good driver positioning. The seating in the Baja is of a 2 2 configuration. The rear seats are made of the same perforated leather material as the front, and also offers a center console with cup holders. The center console in the rear is a bit shallow, but should provide adequate storage for CDs and loose change. Interior room is good both up front and in the rear. Like a 4 door truck , the back seat is where the cabin dramatically ends. Rear leg room is slightly less than the front, however most passengers should not have a problem with head or leg room whether they are sitting in the front or back of the Baja.

Storage is good, that is if you don't mind your stuff being exposed to the outside. Like a truck, 99% of the Baja's storage space is located in the bed. Unlike most trucks the bed of the Baja is absolutely tiny! No more than 3.5 ft long, the Baja will not exactly cater to moving huge furniture items. The back seats do fold down allowing a passage to the truck bed enabling additional storage, but the inlet into the cabin is so small that only boards or thin items can fit. As a $300 option, you can go with the bed extender which allows for 1.5 more feet of room. If you plan on hauling anything with this vehicle other than wet suits or groceries I suggest investing in this option. The Baja also comes standard with roof racks which aid in storage. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, this disables a wind deflector for the sunroof, so you have the compromise of extreme wind noise when the sunroof is down.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 Like the Brat, the Baja is definitely a unique vehicle, and is by far Subaru's most controversial design for the 2003 model year. When driving this vehicle I received almost nothing but sneers from other drivers. A few drivers unrolled their windows and asked me what I was driving and  how much it cost. Nobody whom I talked to liked the price. One comment went something like  "I like the shape, but the color is gross." The color of my Baja was a yellow tangerine like shade with gray body cladding. I personally did not mind this yellow shade, however silver with silver body cladding is much easier on the eyes. The front fascia of the Baja looks like an Outback, while the rear looks like a small truck. The overall design seems awkward, this  may or may not be a a selling point, many might find it 'cute.' Noting that I have not seen one of these vehicles on the road since production, I doubt this will be the case. The Baja has a  good looking set of 16" 5-spoke alloy wheels as standard equipment, and white lettered Bridgestone tires to add some 'truck like' styling cues. 

<b>Price, Reliability, and Warranty:</b> The base price of the Baja starts at around $24,000. With a little optional equipment, as was equipped on my tester, such as the bed extender, and an automatic transmission, the price rose to nearly $25,000. But that's not all. Even though the local Subaru dealership had not sold one of these vehicles in the two weeks they have had them on their lot, they still had a $2,000 dollar exclusivity dealer mark-up. The final sticker price was a little over $27,000. The 2.5 4-cylinder found in the Baja has been around for quite some time, and has been very reliable in the past in other cars like the Legacy, this however does not give me a say in overall reliability for this new 2003 model. I forecast Subaru has yet again produced a reliable vehicle here. If anything does happen to your new Subaru Baja, Subaru offers a 3 year 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty, and a 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty. 


<i>Final Notes:</i>

The Subaru Baja is a unique vehicle, yet is more about novelty than overall real world practicality due to the tiny bed, limited off road use, etc. The look of the vehicle suggests a playful like ride, yet the engine suggests only point A-B transportation. If Subaru could work on engine performance, better fuel economy, lay off the body cladding, and lower the MSRP I feel they could have a real winner here, until then I feel the Baja is going to be somewhat of a flop. I'm going to rate this vehicle at 3 stars, the pleasant interior, good handling, and smooth transmission get much deserved credit.
