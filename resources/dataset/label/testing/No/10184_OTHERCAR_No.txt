            This car was purchased due to the reputation of vendor - in my opinion they talk a better image than reality.  The driver of this car is a 120 pound female.

In less than two years the leather seats are starting to show cracks.  This evidently is a known deficiency that has been confirmed by the owner of the dealership and the head of their service department.  In fact, Lexus has offered to replace all of the seats for free --- this seems to confirm a less than acceptable quality within the interior of the vehicle.

With the increased competition within the SUV space - I would highly recommend investigating other manufacturers before investing in this vendor.<br><br>
