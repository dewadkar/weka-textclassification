            I had owned an 87 nissan sentra for five years and had absolutely loved the vehice.  In fact, my brother also owned one, and both of my parents drove Nissan Maximas.  The thing that struck me about the car was the fact that it was one of the least expensive cars on the American highway, but it got fantastic gas mileage, never broke down, and had very tight and responsive handling.

I eventually gave up my Sentra in 1992 for a Chevy pickup truck, which I needed to haul my things around for the military training schools I was attending at the time.  

When I decided to buy a new car in 1996, I was looking for something that had great mileage and would be very reliable, since we tended to take long trips to get away from the dusty New Mexico town that the Air Force had stationed me in.  We looked at Saturns, Honda Civics, Dodge Neons, and Sentras.  

In the end, it came down to the Sentra and the Honda Civic.  Both of the cars had a nice ride, but the Honda was clearly a little better put together.  It had a subltly smoother transmission, and the finish on the inside and out seemed to be a little smoother, with tighter seams.

However, it was a close race, and I did have a good experience with the Sentra previously.  So, when the Honda dealerships didn't move on their price, and the Nissan dealship did, we naturally chose the Nissan, at about a thousand dollars cheaper than the Civic.

After three years of driving my rattletrap, I can say that I wish I had bought the Civic.  The Nissan has the propensity to develop more annoying rattles than any other vehicle I have driven.  The rattles are not stationary, nor are they consistent.  On one day a rattle may be coming from the driver's door jamb, and on another it will be a squeak from the dashboard.  These aren't just little noises, either.  The radio often can't put out enough noise to distract one from the sounds that pop up all over this car.

In addition to the squeaks, I have also noticed the tendency of the body towards rust.  Any chips must be mended with the touchup paint immediately, as rust is wont to set in within a day or two of a rock strike.

Other items I have not enjoyed are:

   Having to grind the right rotor to remove the warp that began immediately after warranty end.

   The trunk lid that often takes two or three tries to latch.

   The (loud)tweety bird noise the engine makes occasionally when it's cold

On the pro side, the car does get excellent mileage (44 mpg), and hasn't required any major maintenance efforts.  But the lack of finish and the annoyances have made me seriously reconsider my decision to purchase the Sentra over the Civic.
