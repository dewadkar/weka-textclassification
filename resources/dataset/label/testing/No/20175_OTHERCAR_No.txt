            We recently spent 10 days in Barbados with a Suzuki swift rental car. It was a five speed manual hatch-back with an am/fm stereo and little else. Let me just say that my initial impression upon approaching this car was, "What a piece of sh@$." Our time with the car did not dispell this notion. It had it's good points, but not enough of them to make me want to run out and buy one when my 95 Ranger has outlived its stay.

INTERIOR: Plastics were cheap, as can be expected in such a cheap car. Dash panels as well as the turn signal and headlight lever vibrated on bumpy roads. There were large gaps between panels. I'm sure I could have pulled them off without tools.

The interior was also too monochromatic for my tastes. Some light colors would have been nice but it was all charcoal gray.

Ergonomics left something to be desired. We kept turning on the headlights instead of the turn signals by mistake. By the way, those wipers squeaked annoyingly. The climate controls, radio and clock were arranged in that order from top to bottom. I would have preferred the reverse, but I did like the fact that they were tilted slightly towards the driver. Everything was clearly marked but the radio buttons were too small.

The clutch was a bit heavier than I would have liked, but the shifter was yet another good point. Throws were a bit longer than I like in a car but it was very precise and smooth, with little free play in the gates. I found it impossible to miss gears.

The seats were nothing special, but not bad. The front seats offered pretty good lumbar support but not enough thigh support. There was good lateral support on the bottom cushion but not as good on the seat back. On this cheap of a car I was surprised to find I could sit in it for long periods of time without serious discomfort. They were firm but not too hard.

Leg room was also another surprise, as we had five average height adults in the car and no one had to ride with their knees folded into their chests. Rear hip and shoulder room and head room were the weak points.

The am/fm stereo was very basic, not a quality system. Low volume quality was OK but it couldn't be very loud and it was lacking in quality bass. It sounded very tinny in the mid ranges.

Our car was a four door hatch back, but there was a cargo cover behind the rear seat that hid our posessions. That was a very useful feature. Trunk space was OK. We were able to fit enough stuff for a day of site seeing and a picnic. A week's worth of luggage or groceries for two would probably fit without trouble. For four it gets iffy and you may have to travel light. Other than that interior storage was limited and consisted of a glove box that could have been useful had its space been better utilized. The top of the glove compartment protrudes further than the bottom, so though it was actually fairly deep the bottom part was recessed so that we couldn't fit much in before we risked everything falling out whenever we opened it.

Ride: Never very jarring but it was extremely busy. We felt the big bumps and the small ones, but they never pronounced themselves in a way that made our heads hurt. The smallest irregularities were well damped.

Handling: With that rudamentary suspension that contacts the road through 165 millimeter wide 13 inch tires, don't expect to go auto crossing. The body leans more than my truck, and the tires squeal very early, an annoying thing when you try to gather up speed as you enter the traffic circles that were so plentiful in Barbados. 

You would think such a small car would be very maneuverable in tight spots, but a lack of power steering combined with a big turning radius  necessitated a few more twists of the wheel than should have been needed in tight turns and U-turns. It could have been more agile and tossable through the curves had it not been for the slow steering and body lean.

Acceleration: It moves. I was thankful for that much. To make it pull you'll have to get it past 4000 rpm and risk blowing it up because nothing happens any sooner in the rev range. 73 horsepower can only do so much.
But once you're up to speed and the engine is straining at the upper limits of the rev range you get just about enough power to get you through traffic.

Interior noise levels: Wind noise is fairly well damped, probably because this car pushes so little air. The suspension, while not a technological marvel, does not clunk or clatter much over the bumps though you still feel them. No, what you hear most is that raucious little lawn mower engine that they put under the hood. It's the bigger 70 horsepower one, but that still isn't much so we kept it at about 5000 rpm much of the time to keep up with traffic.(I know, I know, very hard on a car, but it's not ours thank god!) Engine noise escalates from a lumpy, uneven, stuttering idle to a loud wail that reminded me I should mow the lawn when I got home. There were also squeaks and rattles from the rear. I think interior panels are too loose. In general this car is not tight or very well put together.

Stopping: The brakes on this car are downright horrible. Such a light vehicle should be able to drop on a dime but it feels like they use drum brakes in the rear instead of disks and there was no anti-lock feature. Add the girly tires and poor traction to the mix, and you have to plan stops carefully. We even skidded a bit in low speed panic stops from 30-40 mph. Wet stopping is even worse, though thankfully it always braked in a straight line. IT was just a very long straight line.

Other Annoyances: The passenger side door refused to lock without the key, and the driver's side door refused to unlock with it. A few times the engine seemed on the verge of failing before the idle picked up again and it stopped just short of stalling. There shouldn't be a car left on the market without standard ABS and at minimum a tape deck. And thirteen inch tires are OK on a big-wheel toy but not on a passenger car. This car desparately needs more of a contact patch with the road.

Overall I give it a C-. This car is designed to get you from place to place. Not very quickly or comfortably, just to get you there. It does not give many of the benefits, such as better handling, maneuverability, and shorter braking distances, that you should be able to get in such a light weight car. If you absolutely cannot afford anything better go for it, as it gets the job done. But if you're looking for one of those feature packed miracle cars that gives you tons of refinement, performance, features, quality engineering, and value at an absurdly low price look elsewhere. This ain't it. You do get what you pay for, but nothing more. Personally, I would rather save more money to spring for something I will not dread driving on long commutes on a day to day basis. For only a few thousand more you can get more comfort and refinement in a Civic or a Corolla with better reliability and just as good fuel economy. It's something good for singles and young college or high school kids who need basic transportation. I found lots of pleasant surprises but not enough of them to make it worth it to me.
