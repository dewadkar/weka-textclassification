            Dear <a href="/user-howard_creech">Howard</a>,

This year, I was determined to bring myself into the digital age.  What kick-started me was the fact that I wanted to do some Spring cleaning and get some things loaded on to <b>eBay</b>.  You know - people are wary of buying unless they can see for themselves what shape your stuff is in!

I'll confess.  I didn't read your buying guide.  I should have.  In addition, I should have read through every single one of your reviews, but I didn't.  Oh no.  Miss Impulsive Shopper just went out and picked the first one she laid her eyes on.  Well, not quite, but almost.

My goal was just to go to <b>Walmart</b>, take a look at what was available, play with them, and see if any one of them stood out for me.  

And so I did.

I saw quite a few cameras by manufacturers I knew - <b>Kodak</b>, <b>Minolta</b>, <b>Sony</b>, <b>Canon</b> - and <b>Vivitar</b>.  I once had a <b>Vivitar</b> camera and I liked it.  It was easy to use and pictures turned out well.  

<b>Vivitar</b> had a couple of different models on display.  The one that drew my attention was this model - <b>Vivitar 2.1-MP ViviCam 3625 Digital Camera</b>.  What I liked about it was that it was attractive, small, and <i>seemed</i> simple to use.  There was a rather larger, LCD area in which to view the picture you had just taken.  That's all it took, I was hooked.  I took it to the cashier-dude, and I plopped down some $$$ for it.

The fun began when I got home and <i>tried</i> to use it.  Where was the ac adapter?  <i>sigh</i>  Why was there TWO instruction booklets?  <i>sigh</i>  How do I OPEN this thing to get batteries in it?  <i>sigh</i>.

You know how much I *hate* reading instructions.  I did try to read both instruction booklets - one was a "quick start" and the other was the full blown deal.  I have to admit, I didn't understand everything that I read however, I thought that that was okay.  If I could <i>just</i> get enough info so that I could use the darn thing - that's all I cared.

Okay, so I thought I knew enough to begin.  I found the "on" button, turned it on, opened up the front, and peered through the view finder.  The first picture I took was fine.  Actually, kind of neat.  Two pictures later, the thing kept on <i>beeping</i> at me - like it wasn't ready to take another picture so soon.  <i>Grrrr.....</i>.

Because the camera only has a certain amount of memory, I decided to purchase a card for it that held 8 x more.  It was easy to insert (it's in the same place as the batteries), but moving pictures from the camera memory to the card memory is a <i>pain</i>.  I couldn't find a way to mass move - I had to do it one at a time.  That's a click, choose card, save...repeat a bazillion times...<i>Grrrrr</i>...

Okay Howard, about the quality of the pictures...they ranged from good to poor.  Sometimes, the pictures were fine but many times, there were "things" like spots and circles that would appear on my pictures.  I had to be really careful about where I shot my pictures.  You know that I don't have a lot of patience and to have to re-do something got on my last nerve.

The one thing that didn't bother me so much was the <b>MGI PhotoSuite SE 4.0</b>.  It was easy to load and easy to use.  Cropping and rotating are a breeze!  Everything else is too much work for me.

Of course, when I hooked my camera up via the usb port to my computer, and transferred the pictures, my batteries were completely gone.  Seriously, I would hook it up, click on the folder to see the pictures, select all and copy to another folder and then exit.  That took about 1-2 minutes and with brand new batteries in the camera <i>before</i> the delicate operation, the transfer would completely drain those pups.

You know, I went through a LOT of batteries until I broke down and bought an adapter :).

In the end Howard, I just can't stand this camera.  I don't want to use it for my <b>eBay</b> auctions, I don't want to take it to family gatherings, and I surely don't want to count on it working when I most need it.  Now, what can a <i>real</i> beginner like my buy AND be happy with??!!
