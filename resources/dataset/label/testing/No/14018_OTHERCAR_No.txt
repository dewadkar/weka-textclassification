            I had a 1998 Sunfire, with approximately 40K miles on the clock, as a long-term rental while my own car was undergoing accident repairs. During the time I had the car, I used it as a long-haul commuter as well as a weekend excursion vehicle, and I was able to get a thorough feel for the car. Regrettably, most of it is negative.

My particular Sunfire was a white 4-door sedan; the appearance was attractive and distinctive, even though I hated the shape of the headlights. The interior feels cheap in general, especially the way the dashboard vinyl wraps around the dash vents, as well as different plastic parts with mismatched tan color. The instrument cluster was very legible and distinctive in the typical Pontiac fashion, and the orange lighting at night was good, but the clear cover had developed a foggy film on the inside, obscuring my view of the gauges somewhat, and giving me question marks on the workmanship of the vehicle. The low-mounted climate control was very logical, with a separate A/C switch, an improvement over most domestic vehicles. The stereo was large, easy to use, and had so-so sound quality. Based on the looks, I would say this one is a toss-up with its twin, Chevrolet Cavalier.

I hated the driver's seat; its tan fabric not only felt rough, but it felt as if it had been in this car since 1978. Not because it was dirty or damaged (it wasn't!), but because of the fabric itself. If it were comfortable, I would not complain much, but that was not the case, as it was too firm in some places and too soft elsewhere. The upper back was too firm, as were the rear of the seat cushion, but with the rest of the seat being too squishy, I could never get comfortable in it, and it was common for me to start dozing off at the wheel after just 30 minutes of driving. Not good, as I needed this car to make a 60-mile commute in awful Silicon Valley traffic. At least it appeared to be roomy. I did not try the back seat, so no comments. Trunk is average.

This car had the most basic powertrain, which consisted of a 2.2-liter 4-cylinder engine and a 3-speed automatic. I simply cannot forgive 3-speed automatics, unless they are installed in cars with such tiny engines that high rpm's are required to maintain reasonable power; but with virtually all cars available in the US having at least a 1.5-liter engine, that is pointless. I simply do not recommend vehicles available with 3-speed automatics, as well as their manufacturers; the Dodge Neon and the Toyota Corolla VE are the other offenders. With this car's 2.2-liter engine, the lack of overdrive represents a major waste of fuel and extra wear and tear, as well as extra road noise; the engine was booming loudly whenever the speedometer pointed upwards of 65mph. One good thing about this setup was that I was forced to keep my speed down, but since I was driving this car immediately after a major wreck, I was not in a mood to speed anyway. Acceleration was a noisy whine, and it took a while before I could build up enough speed to merge into freeway traffic, unless I was willing to let the transmission kick down for even more noise. Fuel economy was very poor, and the best I could do was 19mpg. I later discovered a leaking left rear tire (and was instructed to return to the rental agency for a car that didn't leak air), but even with the leaking tire taken into account, the mileage is too poor for a 4-cylinder. Braking was mediocre, but again, this was a rental car with 40K miles on it.

The car's steering wheel is in an ugly shade of gray, but it has convenient thickened grab points at 9:30 and 2:30 positions. I found the steering feedback to be slightly numb. There was considerable body roll but not enough to startle me, but it is more than I would like, considering that this is a Pontiac. Ride quality was cushy; this was a car biased more for a comfortable ride than for handling. While this setup may be appropriate for a Chevrolet Cavalier, a Pontiac needs to be more aggressive. Even with the tire problem taken into account, this car was way too soft. After a drive along the back roads of Napa Valley, these feelings only got stronger, and again, the uncomfortable seat was putting me to sleep.

Reliability is something I cannot comment very objectively on, as I only had this car as a rental. But neither the Sunfire nor the Cavalier are known for reliability; in fact they score on the low end of the reliability scale. Even for a rental, it seemed quite worn out and tired for a 40K-mile car. I was given a 33K-mile Ford Escort as a replacement when I returned the Sunfire because of the tire leak; the Escort was still in virtually brand-new condition.

Overall, this car struck me as mediocre in many aspects and downright terrible in others. This is pretty shameful considering the ambitious origins of this model. It was born in 1981 as Pontiac Sunbird, a mechanical twin of Chevrolet Cavalier, as product of a failed world-car project that yielded Opel Ascona and Vauxhall Cavalier for the Europeans. In Europe, these cars were further refined, then replaced in the late 1980's by Opel/Vauxhall Vectra, a formidable competitor in the mid-size segment and the basis for Saturn L-Series. In North America, the marketers built more permutations of this car, such as Oldsmobile Omega, Buick Skyhawk, and even Cadillac Cimarron, but the engineering never kept up. The current generation was not introduced until 1995, and by then both the Sunbird and the Cavalier had slid a full class down into econocar territory, and not respected much there either. And there are no updates in sight until 2003, when a new Cavalier/Sunfire will be built as a twin of Opel's smaller Astra. This car may be something then, but until then, it will be just a mediocre car and a shameful legacy to GM's grand ambitions. Even with the Astra-based Sunfire, I will be skeptical, because GM's only world car so far, Opel Kadett/Pontiac LeMans/Daewoo LeMans/Daewoo Nexia, was a very bad car. If you are a GM loyalist, like a friend of mine in Ohio who owns an Ohio-built '95 Cavalier and insists that it is superior to Honda's Ohio-built Accord, then the Sunfire/Cavalier will suffice. Otherwise, shop around. Even within GM's own ranks, Saturn's S-Series seems to be better.

Correction: I just got a feedback saying that the correct Oldsmobile model to be listed above should be Firenza. The Omega was the larger Buick Skylark's twin, now that I recall correctly, and not part of the world car project.<br><br>
