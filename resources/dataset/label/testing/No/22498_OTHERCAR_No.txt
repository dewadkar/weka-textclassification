            I bought my L-200 in June 2001.  The 2002 were coming out in July, so they were motivated to move the remaining 2001 inventory.  I got 0.9% financing to make an attractive car have an even more attractive financing deal.

Man, I love this car.  I drive about 50 miles one way to work.  I'm on the road over 2 hours a day.  That's a good portion of my time spend in the car.  But I don't mind.  (No, really I don't!)

This car is comfortable (by the way, I'm a big guy.  Well, to be honest, I'm not so much big as I am fat.  I go about 250 and I'm only 5'6").  My wife and I have a 4 year old who's still in a car seat.  We've taken trips with 5 in the car and everyone's been comfortable.  And I'm not talking about having 2 skinny little kids and a full size car seat in back.  Think more like a full size car seat, a normal size 12 year old and me all in the back seat for 3 hours.  But hey, guess what?  It was still comfortable (Yes, even for the normal size 12 year old!!).

Stuff I like:

Decent fuel economy.  This is a 4 cyl. automatic that gets about 30 mpg on the highway with the air conditioner running.  Sure, I wish it got 35 or 40, but 30's ok.

Roomy and comfortable.  See above.

Good stereo with CD and Cassette.

Nice looking 4 door sedan.  It has the regular power stuff (windows, door locks, etc.)


Stuff I don't like as much:

I can't get an oil change anywhere I want.  Apparently, the oil filter is a new style and only the Saturn dealers have them.  I've heard this isn't uncommon, and in about 6 months, I'll be able to get my oil changes anywhere.  The up side to this, when Saturn services your car, they give it a free touchless car wash!

I wish the little compartment between the front seats was a little wider, less deep and longer.  It doubles as a cubby hole and an arm rest.  But it doesn't come far enough forward as an arm rest.  Of course, if you read above, you know I'm only 5'6", so my seat is pretty far forward.  If I had the seat a few inches further back, I bet this wouldn't bother me that much.

Here's the bottom line:

I've had this car for 5 months and about 10,000 miles.  I still love it.  Sure there are a couple things I'd change, but nothing major.  This is just a great car!
