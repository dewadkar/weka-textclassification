            After owning both 1992 and 1994 Pontiac Trans Sport mini vans, I would not recommend purchasing either of these models.  We had major transmission problems with both vehicles and had to completely replace both transmissions to the tune of some $4,500.  The 1994 version's transmission went out only 4 days after we had purchased it from an out of town dealer.  (Also, not a smart move to purchase a vehicle from out of town if you can at all help it.)  Although the Transports were fun vehicles to drive and had very sleek styling, it's hard to have fun driving one when it's in the shop.  My advice would be to check out one of the Toyota, Nissan, or Honda mini van models of late.  Consumer Reports also rates these models much more favorably.<br><br>
