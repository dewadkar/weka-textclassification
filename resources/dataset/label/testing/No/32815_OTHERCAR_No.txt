            Uhhhhhh...... what can I say good about this car besides the fact that the body style is so cute. I am a not so proud owner of the crapalier. I say that because the body is made out of nothing but plastic, the inside interior is so so, the thing where you shift from park to drive or I should say the fuzzy stuff around it has little to be desired..the standard radio (which I had to replace) is a total 80's first car radio ever made replica. My door locks get stuck (supposed to be automatic) and my car door sticks sometimes so bad when it is cold that I cant even get my door open. 

Needless to say besides the fact that my step pops says it gets good gas mileage i think this car is a plastic death trap waiting to happen.  <br><br>
