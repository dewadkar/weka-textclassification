            We bought a Suzuki Wagon in 1999 that had 15,000 kilometres on it. I had previously owned 2 other Suzuki cars and I was fairly pleased with both cars performance. 

We bought the wagon as an upgrade to our Swift. At the time, the wagon performed much better than the swift - so we were pleased.

Remember, if something sounds to good to be true - it probably is:

- At 18,000 kilometres, the transmission "blew-up". 

- The noisy suspension is an "inherent problem" with no solution.

- At 25-30,000 km, <b>Grinding Noise</b>. The Brakes and Rotors were worn beyond repair. The dealership explained it was also an inherent problem of the Suzuki Esteem Wagon

- We thought the car was fixed until a a few days later. It started making the noise again. We took it to our dealership. They took it for a drive and declared that it needed new tires and new wheel bearings.


Guess what, that was a year ago, and the car still makes that grinding noise when we press on the brakes. They don't think that anything further can be done and they have refused to look at any of the brake components.

So...don't buy this car!!!!!
