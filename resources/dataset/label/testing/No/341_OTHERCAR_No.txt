            I have to admit right away that I bought the XTerra entirely for its looks and my ego. It's a really cool looking truck. I wish I had waited for a few reasons.

The biggest was the price. I got destroyed by the dealer because he knew I wanted it, and it was very popular when I bought it. I'm still paying, and I will be for a while.

As for the actual truck itself, it's not bad, but I wish I had bought a used Pathfinder for the same money. I used to drive for a living, every type of main stream vehicle on the road today, and this one doesn't rate terribly high in my SUV book. 

The biggest issues I've noticed is a tendency to swing out in the back end of the truck due to the height. I regularly spin out in puddles turning out of my street in the morning, even if fully loaded. The same tendency is compounded off road if you're going over 20 mph. The rear tends to be nimble, but that same agility can be an issue if you lose control in the back end. I would hate it on ice. It handles lightly and responsively, but if you need more stability, it's not as good at delivering. I would not use a winch with this truck, as it doesn't have the grabbing power in the back end that would make a winch useful. The wheels and axles can be noisy in hard turns, and the tires tend to squeal regardless of all my efforts to keep the pressure balanced.

The front turning radius is a wonderful thing, and responds well on and off road. I'm not sure how it is in mud, but it performed well in 4" of snow on the road. The tippy feeling could be an issue, especially with a load in the roof rack. Also, my rear passengers always complain about turns and speed since they are higher up. They tend to feel the movement more, so I recommend putting car sick folks in the front seat. 

Interior styling is generic, even in the second from the top of the line model I have. Cup holders are handy unless you have a super sized cup. The rear cup holders are a nice touch, but they are tippy because they are shallow. The glove compartment is stupidly small, and their own manual doesn't even fit.

Grandma and little kids will have difficulty getting into this vehicle. It's very high and the rear seats are tough for me to get into at times. The running boards help, but it's like mounting a horse. Loading into and out of the rear tailgate is ok, although the height makes digging stuff out of the back difficult at times. 

I have slept in the back, rear seats folded down flat. We both fit, although not terribly comfortably. Plenty of room front to back, but close on the sides. 

The roof rack is not as heavy duty as it looks. Put your sleeping bags and lighter, bulky loads up top. The rails are not useful for bungee cords, as the only thing to hook on to is the bolts holding the rack to the roof. I have switched to using cotton rope for tie downs. 

I will be field testing the tow hitch with a cross country trip in a few weeks. The gas mileage is stinky, especially if you add any sort of load. This is not an inexpensive truck to maintain. Plan on lots of fuel, or get a small car for your short trips or commuting. 

The brakes had to be replaced after 20,000 miles( and the dealer said that was good for XTerras!). The pads are organic, and the squealer was very high, making my brake life very limited. I'm planning on replacing the dealer pads with non-organics as soon as they are available.

I recommend the extended warranty if you're planning on keeping it past the factory warranty's life. This truck isn't bad, but I've already had lightbulbs out and other little things dealt with.
