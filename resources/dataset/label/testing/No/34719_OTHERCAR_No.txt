            When the Sebring came out back in the mid-90's, I drooled over one.  I even almost bought one, until I saw three new ones broken down on the side of the road in one day.  Now that I've spent a couple of days behind the wheel of one, I'm glad that I didn't.

Let's get the specifics out of the way.... The Sebring JXi has a 2.5 liter 6 which makes about 160-170 horsepower.  It has 2 doors, an automatic top, an automatic transmission, leather seats with power adjustment for the driver, and various and sundry other goodies (like a fun-to-play with trip computer).  

So, what's wrong with this vehicle:

1) Build quality....  My rental with 17000 miles has an insane electrical system.  The alarm goes off for no reason.  The door ajar sensor goes bonkers while driving.  The courtesy lights stayed on for 3 hours.  And I keep hearing a relay clicking somewhere in the dashboard.  I'd say that these problems are because it's a rental, but given Chrysler's reputation for not being able to put a car together, I have a hunch that this is par for the course.

2) Handling....  You'd think that a car like this would be fun to drive.  Sure, it's not particularly small but there are equally large and heavy cars that are moderately fun to drive (like a Camaro Z28 or Camry Solara Convertible, which is 6 inches shorter with about the same wheelbase).  Driving on a moderately twisty road (CA 49 through Calaveras and Tuolumne counties), I found myself hitting the brakes again and again to ensure that I went through turns at no more than 5-10 miles over the posted "recommended" speed.  I'm not sure where the car was trying to go, but it wasn't trying to get us safely around the curve.  It didn't feel heavy and substantial, like a Town Car (http://solpo.epinions.com/auto-review-4DED-1FBAD282-39E9F431-prod4), it felt sluggish, like it really didn't feel like it wanted to be driven.  The brakes also didn't help--when I hit them, the car felt like it took a dive.  Not fun.  Even on the freeway, I felt no desire to drive more than 65-70 (and I've been known to hit 90 in both compact cars and SUVs).  

3) Powertrain....  Judging from its ability to get up to speed even on hills, I have no doubt that this car has more than adequate hustle to get one from points A to B relatively comfortably and quickly.  And in some ways, it has a sporty powertrain...  When you hit the gas, it drops into a particularly low passing gear.  To its credit, it accelerates quickly, and the automatic lets you run the engine right up to the redline before it upshifts.  The bad news?  The passing gear is so low that it actually caused my wife and I to lurch forward in our seats.  Plus, the engine doesn't make a roar, or a gurgle, or anything like what you'd expect from the chrome-plated dual exhaust ports.  It complains, in a tinny fashion.  Stock Japanese econoboxes sound better than this does.

4) Visibility  ....  I'm 5'5" and I had to lower my seat all of the way.  Why?  The windshield is so low that it was blocking my view.  I like to look high and try to keep a view of the road ahead.  Forget about doing this if you are much taller than I am, unless you want to look over the windshield.  Granted, vision out the side and back is pretty good when the top is down, so this may balance things out a bit.  When the top is up, there are large blind spots on the left and right rear, but, in all honesty, driving isn't as terrifying as one might expect.

5) Split personality.  Let's see what we have here....  A sporty-shifting automatic, with sluggish boat-like handling.  A convertible that makes you want to go out and have fun, and an exhaust system that complains when you go out to have some.  Room for a 6 foot driver, but a windshield that blocks your view.  This car doesn't know what it wants to be, and that leaves me not wanting to own one.

After all of this bashing, I still have to admit that we have had a wonderful time in it.  I've logged about 170 miles over all types of roads (in-town residential, in-town major artery, highway, easy rural 2-lane, twisty 2-lane) and it's still a joy with the top down.  

A couple of miscellaneous notes....  The air conditioning worked wonderfully.  Cruise control was easy to work (steering wheel mounted controls) and held speed well up and down hills.  The stereo sounded fine with AM and FM radio when the top was up--top down, it's moderately useless.  The top opened and closed with a minimum of effort (undo 2 latches, and hold the switch down for about 10 seconds).  I never needed to look at the owner's manual to figure anything out.  

My advice?  Rent one.  When the weather's nice, they're well worth the extra $30-35 a day over a Grand Am.  Keep it on the freeway or in the suburbs, and keep the top down.  You'll have a blast for the first couple of days.  Then, when you think that you want to buy one (and you quite likely will), take it on a twisty road.  You'll find yourself able to avoid stopping at the Chrysler dealer.

I wanted to love this car.  But I didn't.  The handling, transmission, driving position, and reliability/build quality (both in this case and empirically) are all strong strikes against it.

So I'm going to take it back over the next couple of days and hopefully get something better....  More Epinions to follow!
