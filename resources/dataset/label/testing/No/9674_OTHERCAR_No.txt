            I would not recommend this car to MY WORST ENEMY!
I bought the car 2000 miles outside of the factory warranty, within 1,000 miles the head gasket blew -
Had that fixed and then had to have the exhaust manifold replaced - 
The car started making a loud gurgling/knocking noise after this was done, the service center replaced the entire short block... Which helped for about 1,000 miles.
Then the car started running on 3 cylinders and I found out that one of my spark plugs was fried and then shortly after I replaced the plug the wires fried.
When I go through a moderately deep puddle (3 inches or so) the water sprays right up under the hood taking out the power steering and the car becomes UN-STEERABLE, not DIFFICULT to steer, IMPOSSIBLE to steer.
My trunk is moldy and smells like mildew -
Washing the car leaves a puddle in my trunk and moisture under my tail light covers - 
The A/C has a horrible smell which is very similar to moldy cat urine... 
My exhaust manifold mysteriously cracked again after 15,000 miles.
Now there is a loud clunking noise when making right turns, another known issue with the vehicle.
The seats will have your back aching in a matter of minutes, the body roll doesn't help that.. you spend alot of time using your back to compensate for the roll.
I now have an exhaust leak and am at 60,000 miles currently.
Definately take a look at the NHTSA website before even CONSIDERING this vehicle. 
Oh yeah, and the wheel covers rattle horribly. 
I feel like a total sucker.
