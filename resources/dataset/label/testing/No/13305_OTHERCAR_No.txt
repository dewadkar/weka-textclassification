            Expanded Pros:
Very roomy!  I'm a large man, and it's one of the first cars that wasn't a "boat" in which I had all the elbow room I could want.  The car drives well -- smooth steering and solid braking.  Plenty of room for two kids in the back and two adults up front.  Ours came with a built in booster seat, which has come in handy on occasion.

We took several extended road trips with the family (two kids and two adults), and it's a joy to ride in.

Expanded Cons:

Dodge Stratus Gasket

You will see literally hundreds of customer reviews in which the head gasket had to be replaced (sometimes repeatedly).  There are several Technical Service Bulletins on this problem, but as of yet, no recalls (which is a huge downside to this car).

I absolutely loved it.  I owned a '96, until the head gasket blew with under 100K miles, and it was past the manufacturers warranty.

Also, I had chronic problems with one of the CO2 sensors burning out repeatedly (approximately 6 times in 3 years).  Once the warranty was up, I had to pay for the problem myself.  Even though it was documented as a chronic problem for my car, the dealership wouldn't cover it (or fix the underlying problem).  Apparently, the computer said that nothing was wrong once the sensor was replaced, so the dealership couldn't do any further investigation -- if the computer didn't tell them what was wrong, they said there was no way for them to identify the problem.  That being said, I haven't seen this reported as a chronic issue for the model in general (so was most likely an aberration).
