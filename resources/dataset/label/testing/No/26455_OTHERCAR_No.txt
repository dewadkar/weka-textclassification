            Let me start out by saying that my Pontiac experience began at birth with my grandfather's 1963 Pontiac Bonneville.  He's had one for as long as I've been alive, right up to the 1997 model that he's got now.  None of them really made an impression until I was old enough to drive, then I began to wonder, &quot;Why do they keep buying these things?&quot;

When I was 19, I got to borrow the 84 Bonneville for a few months.  It wasn't particularly impressive, but it had more power then the 72 Beetle that I owned, and that was enough.  That is, until I noticed that the thing was falling apart after a few years.  The first casualty was the padded center of the steering wheel that would fall off.  Then it was the side view mirrors that wouldn't adjust.  Eventually, most of the amenities just didn't work anymore.  So, in 1997, the grandparents broke down and got a brand new Bonneville.

Again, the car was a blast to drive.  Good handling for its size, and acceptable performance.  I got in the car this weekend to take the grandparents somewhere and make a quick mental note that the car had 30,000 miles, then noticed that part of the molding inside the driver's side interior door handle had fallen off.  Deja vu.  Again, I was reminded why Ford and GM are taking such a big hit from BMW, Volkswagen, and Toyota.  The big three look nice when they're new, but give them a few years and they'll show their true colors.
