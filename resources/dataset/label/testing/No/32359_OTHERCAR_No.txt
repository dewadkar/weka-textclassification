            This car looks great ....sitting in my driveway because it doesn't run. I wasn't looking for a lawn ornament when I decided to buy this car. 
The transmission died on me and because it is a "special" transmission, no one can fix it. The dealership told me it is impossible to rebuild it and my only option is to replace it with a new one that would cost me more then the car is worth. It's a sealed transmission so I can't even check the fluid in it.
The engine is also on it's way out. 
It's been in the shop more days then I've actually been able to drive it!. 
The paint on the hood is discolored. 
It's a beautiful car but I'd never, ever buy one again and strongly encourage others to not buy one!.
