            I received this camera last year for a gift.  Having only used the Kodak Mavica previously, I was totally impressed with this camera.  The best thing about this camera is the controls.  It has the best interface of any digital camera I have seen.  The controls are very straightforward and completely intuitive.  Unfortunately, everything else is not as good.  The picture quality is a mixed bag.  Outdoor pictures in bright light turn out great as do shots with the macro lens.  Using the flash though often leads to dissapointing overly-red photos.  Even the best photos with this camera though pale in comparison next to those from the Nikon-coolpix.  The battery life on this camera is another problem, with alkaline batteries lasting minutes and the provided rechargable batteries lasting about 20 minutes.  The largest problem though is simply the time the camera takes to start, to switch between pictures and to take pictures.  The longer you have the camera, the more the time lag annoys.  Finally, after 9 months of use, the camera began shorting out occasionally.  A warranty repair that took a month fixed the shorting but returned the camera unable to take pictures in focus.  So, overall, don't buy this camera.  If you want a cheap reasonable camera, the RDC-4200 offers everything this camera does except the useless sound recording and if you want a great camera, go for the Nikon.<br><br>
