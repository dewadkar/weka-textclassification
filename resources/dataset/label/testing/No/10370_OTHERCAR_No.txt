            My 1998 Kia Sephia was a gift from my parents.  I received it in October of 1998.  I loved it because it was purple, had a CD player, and was new.  When I drove it off the lot it had 58 miles on it.  Right now it has 31,558 miles on it and has been in the shop 16 times in two years and is currently being recalled for another part.  From the fuel pump, to the adhesive on a pump in my engine, the problems range throughout the car.  My brake rotors and pads have been changed 4 times.  This is not normal I assure you.  

The dealerships where I go to get my car serviced treat me like I am an idiot.  They are rude and don't care.  My car has hesitated forever and each time I try to explain it and get it fixed they say they can not duplicate the problem.  I don't care if they can duplicate it, just try to fix what may cause it.  I travel 156 miles at least every other weekend between my home and college.  We were looking for a car we could trust and this wasn't it.  

Driving this vehicle is very scary at times, especially after it rains the brakes grab and you jolt forward.  When the car hasnt been driven for a day it is very hard to crank and the brakes grab until they &quot;warm up.&quot;  No one should buy this vehicle, at least the 1998 since that is the only one I have experience with.

My whole purpose is to portray the bad side of the Kia Sephia.  I realize that not all of them are as bad as this one, and I also realize everyone deserves to be heard.
