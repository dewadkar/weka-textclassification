            In April of 1999 I decided to reward myself with a new car.  I had never owned a new car before and thought I would check out the VW's.  They have really cool commercials right?  I loved the way the car looked inside and out and initially,  the way the car drove.  It didn't last.  Within six months the ride quality had decreased dramatically and after taking the car to the dealer for an inspection they discovered two collapsed struts which they refused to cover under warranty.  My car drives like a 15-year-old Jeep.  I received second and third opinions from reputable mechanics who agree that my car has severe manufacturers defects and or was damaged during shipping.  Volkswagen has treated me like a stranger and I have had to take legal action.  I will never own another VW and will trade this hunk of junk the first chance I get.  One of VW's main selling points is their warranty.  Trust me.  It doesn't mean crap.  The service manager makes the call on what he wants to cover under warranty.  Bottom line is, the service department doesn't make money fixing cars for free.  I have read all of the positive reviews on the Jetta and am really jealous that I got such a lemon and VW won't make it right.  1/25/00.  After spending a lot of time going through arbitration, a qualified inspector ruled in my favor.  My car is now at the VW dealership getting fixed.  It has been there for over a week.  They are having trouble getting the parts.  What a surprise.  <br><br>
