            On August 7, 1999 I bought a brand new Chevy Cavalier 2000 because I wanted a new car that I didn't have to worry about repairing all the time. Well, I got it! I had it 3 months (no problems). I was on top of the world. The fourth month came and I started hearing a whistling sound coming from the driver-side dashboard. I monitored it for a month and took it to the shop in January to be checked. It whistled upon acceleration   (10-15 mph, 20-25 mph, 30-35 mph, 50-55 mph). And when driving 55mph the whistling noise would sound every few seconds. I only had to take it in the shop 4 times between January and March. First the Mechanic changed the alternator, then the pulley and belt, the next visit was the heater hose and coolant and finally the mechanic discovered that the problem was the Idle Air Control (I.A.C.). But that was the goods news. The bad news was Chevrolet had not redesigned it, yet. And now it can't be fixed. There are 2 things I tell people who ask me about how I like my car. 
#1 &quot;Let's put it this way. My car whistles Dixie, and I don't like that song.&quot; 
#2 &quot;If I wanted a Kistler Whistler, I would have bought a Ford.&quot; 
(There's a Ford dealership that is called Kistler Ford in town)  
I can deal with the road and wind noise, but the whistling noise is driving me crazy.<br><br>
