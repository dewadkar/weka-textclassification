            If you want a cheap used Japanese minivan, you have very few options.  For this early era, you were limited to the Toyota Previa, a tiny Honda Oddysey, and this Mazda MPV.  This review is of a 91 MPV which was given to us by my in-laws (God bless them).

<b>Ride and Handling</b>
I don't remember it being this loud 5 years ago and it's not an exhaust problem.  It's just not a particularly smooth or powerful engine but in 1991, you didn't have a lot of choice as far as minivans go.  The 155hp/166lb V6 engine doesn't exactly pin you to your seat.  I'd say acceleration is just adequate.  And it's pretty darn loud when you're flooring it.  I wouldn't bother with the 4 cylinder model.
You get a huge 5 horsepower increase with the 95 V6 model but a corresponding increase in weight as well.
Highway ride is fairly good and bumps are absorbed without much disruption to the passengers.  Steering is not too light either, with good road feel and response.  Insulation from road noise is pretty good.  If this only had a Honda Engine....
In cold weather (below 5 degrees F) it sometimes takes longer for the transmission to upshift from 3rd to 4rth gear when I'm entering the highway.   Hopefully, this problem does not progress.
Cornering is not exceptional or particularly flat but that's to be expected from a vehicle of these dimensions.  I didn't notice too much over-steer for this rear-wheel drive but I don't drive it as aggresively as I would a regular car. Fast cornering around on ramps will definitely give you the impression that you are driving a tall vehicle.
I've driven 91 Caravans and I have to say that I prefer the Mazda for overall road manners, handling, and especially steering.  The steering in the Caravan was pretty unresponsive and reminds me of a '78 Caddy.

The ABS brakes (the brake pads are new) are fairly effective and bring this heavy vehicle to a stop in adequate distances.

<b>Exterior</b>
The van is starting to look dated with all the new minivan designs coming out but I haven't experienced any of the paint problems others on this board seem to have had.  In fact, the paint is in great condition and looks almost new which is saying a lot considering that we live in hell's country of snow and salt.  Maybe the in-laws just took great care of the outside of this car.
Unlike most mini-vans, the rear-left side door opens like a car door (as far out as 90 degrees for easy ingress) instead of sliding.
As far as I know the NHTSA Crash Test on the 98 MPV (similar body) was a 4 out of 5.

<b>Interior and Cargo</b>
I love the seating positions at the front.  Great visibility all around and you can see pretty far out in front.  The cloth interior has also held up well and doesn't look too dated even after 12 years.
The second row seat can recline all the way back forming sort of a bed.  People in the third row can stretch out their legs over it.  Good for long stops but probably not that safe during driving.
Seat removal is a REALLY back-breaking experience.  The second row two seater is very difficult to remove.  I'm fairly strong and I find it a chore even with another person.  We've opted to leave it out of the van because it leaves a lot of space for storage which is close to the rear-side door and when we're baby-sitting the kids are at an advantageous distance in the 3rd row.
Removal of the 3rd row is also a back-breaking experience and you need a socket-wrench to remove it.
Seat fabrics are cheap feeling material but durable.  First row captain's chairs have no lateral support but at least have fold up armrests.
I'm sure the old Chrysler Caravan's of this era fair no better but today's mini-vans are way better (i.e. Honda Odyssey,  Toyota Sienna, and new Mazda MPV).
Once both rows are removed, there's tons of storage capacity.  8 foot 2 by 4s can squeeze in there albeit with a little intrusion between the front two seats.
The glove box is totally useless.  You can fit 2 maps and some papers in there but that's about it.  Best treat this as another map pocket and there won't be any disappointment.  There's also map pockets on each front door and 2 cup-holders attached to the front passenger seat.
Storage bins in the second row wall and door provide the remaining passenger storage.  Rear passengers also get a semi-independent climate control.

<b>Conclusion</b>
We got this as a gift from my in-laws with only 45,000 miles and it has been a very utilitarian vehicle.  I've read in several reports that Mazda MPVs of this model are fairly problematic.  This is not typical of most Mazda products.  If you can, get a later than 94 model.  I've read lemon reports and the earlier model MPVs definitely come up quite frequently.
Right after we got it, I had to replace the brake pads, and timing belt.  After 5 months, the fuel pump died.
I do like this vehicle very much but I don't think it would have been my first choice if we had to purchase it.
