            I purchased this car in December 1996 and was one of the first people to purchase it.  I like the car alot.  I like the handling, ride, comfort, visibility. I look forward to driving it every time I get into it. There's alot of hidden extra's at first I wasn't aware of. Audible warning when your windshield washer fluid is low, audible warning when you leave your turn signals on. Very well ergonomically designed. Great Stereo! Good heat and air conditioning. Roomy. I have recieved extremely good service at the Chevy dealership (Tom Oates Chevrolet in Chester Springs, PA).
But, there were a few repair problems as well:
accelerator pedal always lightly sticks, electronic logic module was replaced under warranty. One thing I was very upset with was (3) motor mounts had to be replaced at 54,000. I felt that Chevrolet should have helped me out with the repair costs but they didn't. It cost $400.00. I contacted Chevrolet Customer Service and they were rude and abrupt. I had no quarrel with my dealership on this. 
UPDATE: For the past several weeks I have been trying to trade the car in and purchase a new one. What I found out to my horror is that the car is hardly worth anything. I did find out the lot retail price and the recommended trade-in value, but none of the NINE (9) dealerships wanted to give me what the average wholesale or anywhere NEAR it. The books say the car retails for about $11,100 given the milage of 58k and the wholesale &quot;LOW&quot; price is about $9,200. The best they can offer me for this is $5,500!!!!!!!!!!  I talked with several wholesalers and car auctioneers and they told me that this car with a 4 cyclinder is worthless.  what I also found out that for some strange reason the GM dealerships where the lowest offers, can't figure that one out since this is a GM car.  I change my mind and I do not recommend this car. Even though i feel this is a pretty nice car, the resale value is nill!<br><br>
