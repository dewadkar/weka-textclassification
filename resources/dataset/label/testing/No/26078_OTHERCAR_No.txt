            I bought the Mazda because I expected it to be a well designed vehicle with good value for the money paid.  It is.  My problem is with the service.  I brought the car to Oak Tree Mazda in San Jose CA for service.  At best, the service I received was strange.  At worst it was fraudulent.

At the 15,000 mile service the technician charged us over $100 for changing the transmission fluid.  Mazda recommends changing the transmission fluid at 50,000 miles - not 15,000.  Further, no mechanic I contacted could explain why the transmission fluid should be changed.  We did mention to the mechanic that the automatic transmission was rough but that is a warranty issue, not maintenance. 

In addition, we should not have been charged for any service.  We have the Mazda extended protection plan which covers all Mazda recommended/required service for the first 25,000 miles.  

While I am working with Mazda corporate to resolve the issue I wanted to pass on my experience to fellow readers of Epinions.  While the Protegee met my expectations from an engineering standpoint the support has been awful.  Support is a key reason for buying a new car over a late model used car.  Next time I will evaluate other manufacturers more carefully.
