            Head-turning styling, a blast to drive, a dream to ride in...And it LOVES to go back to the dealer.

I chose the LHS after test driving other cars of the same class (Lexus ES300, Infinity I30, Accura TL).  This car was the best value and I loved the way it looked and handled.  A true luxury sport sedan that consistently gets 23 MPG.  The heated power seats are incredibly comfortable in graphite leather, the interior appointments are elegant.  Very tight, no squeaks or rattles, some wind noise but not at an objectionable level.  The 360 watt, 11 speaker sound system sounds great but won't blow your socks off.  But when you step on the gas, the 253 HP V6 MOVES.  Chrysler's 0.9% interest plan made it a steal.  I love the car except for one little thing...

I picked the car up on September 20, 1999 and since then the car has been back to the dealer 8 times for the same problem.  The car has leaked differential grease and transmission fluid all over my garage.  This from the car that Chrysler touts in its brochures as being &quot;...so well made that it's unlikely that you'll ever see a drop or even a film of oil on the outside areas&quot;.  The smell of leather is overwhelmed by the spell of hot differential grease.  And the dealer(s) couldn't find where it was coming from.  As of today at 4400 miles, Chrysler has replaced the entire transaxle of the car.  And it still smells.

Chrysler has made a fantastic car that two of their 5 Star dealers are unable to keep on the road.  In 6 months this car has been back to the dealer more than the previous 6 cars TOTAL that my husband and I owned.

DO NOT buy this car if you don't have an alternate mode of transportation.
