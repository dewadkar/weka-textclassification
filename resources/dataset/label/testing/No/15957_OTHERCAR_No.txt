            This camera is a little over priced to me. I feel that the quality of the pictures could be better for the money. I get a little darkness in the pictures in the shade. So that is not good. I feel that the setting on the camera is off. When I first got this camera I said wow I will take it to a family reunion an so I did. I took it home an when I put the pictures on the desk top it was not what I was sooting for. So to say the least I returned it am in the market for a better one.<br><br>
