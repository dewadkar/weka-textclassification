            I bought this product because it was a real deal, it was a 1 day sale and I paid for it only $260 new! But problems began the first day. The camera has a little design problem: when you look to take the photo your nose sticks to the screen and it is difficult to clean the natural nose-grease from those screens. (Sorry for being so gross!) This &quot;nose problem&quot; is solved in their models 265 and 290 but the 280 has the same problem. 

Anyway, that would not be a problem if the pictures would come out well! There was a notorious pixalation in some exposures. So I called Kodak customer service and sent them samples of the photos. They said they would send me a new one and to please send them mine. They pay for both shippings. The new one they sent had the same problem. Two weeks later same procedure: I sent the pictures, then the second camera to Kodak with their approval, they sent me a third one. Third one has the same problem, and they acknoledged it. I think it is a problem with the camera itself so I asked them if I could send the third one back and instead of a new 240 they could send me an upgrade and I would pay the difference. They said no. They agreed that these pixalations were a sample of the &quot;limitations&quot; of the camera.

Overall the Kodak DC-240 is a good machine, but the pixalations are unbareable to me (maybe I am very perfectionist in photo's matters). I bought to my father the Kodak 265 and beside the nose problem that is solved there is no pixalation or whatsoever, it is a great camera! Hope this opinion help you in your camera search.<br><br>
