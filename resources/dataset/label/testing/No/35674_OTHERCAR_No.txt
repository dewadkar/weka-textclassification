            Transmission blew up 10 miles(I kid you not)over the warranty.  Back gate sprang open on a hilly, winding road. Sliding door jumped the track, not once, not twice but numerous times and repairs.(some for free others I paid for.)  I am sorry but I saw nothing grand about this car..but the bills for $1,000's of dollars.

We used this van as family transportation for a busy family with four kids.  It was driven by Mom and Dad so I wouldn't think that the transmission was overly abused, but it blew up during a bad storm after getting stuck.  What made me mad is the fact that we were just a tad bit over warranty..darn good fortune for the dealer.

The door problem was a real mess.  Once when the back gate sprung open(which the dealer said was impossible and then was subject to a recall years later after I had paid to replace the lock) we almost lost a member of the baseball team.  I know kids don't belong in the back..but let's face it sometimes older kids do ride there.

I really liked the room in the van.  The front wasn't all cluttered by dashboard(which of course they changed in later models) but the seats never came out easily and man they weighed a ton and 1/2.  It was a two man or at least one woman and two kid job just to take out the back which was a bench seat.  We had the captain chairs in the middle and both of them removed.  I liked the fact that you could walk from front to back with this option.

We also had a problem when the rear view mirror flew off. It landed in the back passengers lap and we thought that something had busted through the windshield.  It was a problem with the glue used to stick the mirror on.  Good thing it didn't cause an accident.

Speaking of accidents the only redeeming quality of this van was the fact that during a serious accident very little damage was done to the car. All passenger restraints also held.  Thank you for this Chrysler!

We leased this auto for 4 years. It was rode hard and literally fell apart before our eyes. The interior just couldn't take the beating of a family of six in daily use.  We turned it in as a piece of junk and got charged $3,000 for wear and tear to the door, gate and other.  Well let me tell you it was a pleasure to call the bank and say &quot;COME AND GET YOUR VAN.&quot;  I am so glad we didn't purchase this van outright.

I now drive a FORD and that about says it all.

I recently got another recall notice on this van.  I threw it away without opening it since we no longer own the grand voyager.  So if you have a Grand Voyage from 94-99  I would call and check on the latest recall notice.
