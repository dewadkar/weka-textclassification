            I bought this product after doing some research on digital cameras.  I found out this particular product is considered among the mid-range cameras.  I was assured that as an amateur just getting into digital photography this camera would more than suffice.  I was disappointed to find this was not the case at all.
The camera is extremely easy to use.  I was shooting pictures within 5 minutes of opening the box.  The ability to use floppy disks with no extraneous cables was a major plus also.
However, the biggest problem with this camera is the image quality.  The pictures are surprisingly grainy and bad looking.  I was under the impression that the picture quality would rival that of a 35mm camera but that is far from the truth.
My suggestion would be to WAIT before buying a digital camera.  The image quality is bound to get better and the prices will surely drop in the upcoming months.<br><br>
