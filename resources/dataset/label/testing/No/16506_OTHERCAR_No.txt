            I purchased my 1998 VW Cabrio from a used car lot in April 2001. It's dark green with a black top and was made in Mexico.
I immediately replaced a couple of tires at a small garage, and they wore out pretty quickly. I replaced all four tires from a different mechanic, and he said the car needs special tires - the wrong kind may cause the car to flip - so make sure you find a competent mechanic. There's not a lot of pick-up. No problems whatsoever with the ragtop.
The radio is horrible. The speakers are of poor quality and sound fuzzy. The heater vents in the center of the dash blow hot air into the cassette player - I dropped my cassette it was so hot. The a/c dials are cheap. They are about to come off. The driver's seat is a nightmare to try to pull forward or back. The up-down feature is great - I'm little and it lets me sit up higher in the car. The leather on the seat, right behind where my left arm fits, is flaking off. 
The stick shift and clutch work great, as do the power windows, locks and ragtop. 
In December 2002 I had to replace the ignition switch. The brake light and ABS light kept coming on, and the headlights and windshield wipers quit working. If I drove it in dim conditions, I had to use my hazard lights. The trunk is extremely roomy, and there's plenty of room inside, in the front and back seats. The glove compartment could use a little more room. The cup holders are in a tight spot, and any drinks medium-sized or larger won't fit because it's too close to the dash. I end up wedging my drinks between my seat and the emergency brake.
