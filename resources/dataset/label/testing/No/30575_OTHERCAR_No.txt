            Before buying this digital camera for my wife, I already have 4 film cameras, including a medium format Mamiya 7II, Nikon F5, Ricoh GR1s, and Samsung Evoca.  Therefore, I was hesitant to get another camera.  However, the wife wants something that she can use to take photos of our first baby and have the instant gratification of immediately viewing and emailing photos.  So I did lots of research for a digital camera and found the Lumix LC5 which was recently available.  

The specs of the camera seemed impressive.  What got me to give it a try was the Leica lens.  Well, to make the story short, we have shot nearly 1500 photos and some mini movies with it between May 21 and October 2002, and I've hardly touched my other cameras.  

To print the photos taken with the digital camera, we upload them to Walmart photo center, where prints are cheap and the quality is acceptable.  It's so convenient and inexpensive compared to regular film camera.

Uploading photos taken with the camera to a computer is super easy.  Our Window 2000 PC sees the camera as a storage device, when the camera is connected to the PC with a USB cable provided.  Therefore, we just copy and paste photo files like a any other files to the PC's harddrive for long term storage.  

There are so many features to list.  If you are interested in knowing all its features, find Panasonic's web site.  I've recommended this to friends and four of them have bought it and are very very happy.  One friend had to send hers back for repair and was not happy to have had problem after paying a large sum of money for the camera.

The features I really appreciate are: rechargeable lithium ion battery, which really lasts and recharges very quickly, USB connection to a PC, intuitive functions and controls, full manual controls as well as automatic, quality construction and material (it feels like a regular range finder camera and not a cheap plastic toy), easy for the wife to use, very short shutter lag (almost no shutter lag if you use only the view finder to shoot and not rely on the LCD screen), very quick start up, very short wait time between shots, and, best of all, SUPERB lens quality.

It is not perfect, however.  One problem I've found it that the flash does not alway provide accurate exposure, especially at a close range.  The flash works better if a shot is taken at a farther distance and using the zoom  feature to zoom in closer.  The flash exposure can also be controlled, which is very useful.  To have better flash exposure, one can use an external flash attached to the camera's hot shoe. I've yet tried using an external flash, though.  In general, the flash can be accurate and provide good exposures.  A possible problem is that I've experienced pixelation or lack of smoothness overall in one photo I took with the camera set to highest JPG resolution.  This problem has been rare (once out of about 1500 photos), and I don't know if it was the camera or it was me.

I bough a 128Mbyte SC memory card because the 32MByte card that comes with the camera was not enough.  With the 128MB card, I can shoot about 67 highest resolution photos with fill-flash, and the battery would still be usable.

I often sound like I work for Panasonic when I excitedly tell friends about the camera.  Well, I don't work for Panasonic.  I just think it's the digital camera I've been waiting for.  Sure, better ones will come, but this is the best for the $650 price I paid in May 2002.

This is not a pro digital camera, but it has enough features for a serious amateur to appreciate, in my opinion.  If one wants the same lens quality but with less features, consider other cameras in the Lumix line.

UPDATE:  My camera just kicked the bucket at exactly 1 year and 1 month old, and will have to be sent in for repair.  It just died, even though it has been very well cared for and has taken over 2 thousand photos.  My colleague at work also had a dead camara - the same model, but it died much earlier than mine. I think the camera has a quality issue.
The camera was sent to Panasonic for repair ($102.50) and came back not working properly.  The camera would turn on then shut itself off.  Got to send it in again.

Due to the problems that the camera encounters so prematurely and the cost of repair, I cannot recommend this camera.
