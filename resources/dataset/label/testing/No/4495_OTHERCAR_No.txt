            I bought a '95 Villager new.  It was a replacement for a succession of bad Grand Am's.   

I loved it from day one, and still do, but the problems with it drive me nuts.

It handles nice and has great pick-up (when it's running right)

When it was new, I had problems with the door locks locking on their own, the driver's side window switch broke, the armrest fell off, the side door would stick, the brake light burnt out and the dealer wouldn't fix it, although other VIN#'s of the same year were recalled.  The check engine light would go on and off and they couldn't figure out the problem.

Now the check engine light is on and staying on.  They won't fix it.  My mechanic can't and asked me to take it to the dealer because it is a pain to fix.  It gave a running rich code, but the dealer couldn't figure out why.  Tried a $450 computer and gave it back with the light still on.  My husband changed the O2 sensor, the fuel filter, the spark plugs and the wires.  The light is still on.  Because it was running rich, the exhaust smelled so bad and it would hesitate at take off because of too much fuel. Finally, I disconnected the battery, in the hope of resetting the computer. It doesn't hesitate as much from take off anymore, but the darned light is still on.  My mechanic (the one who doesn't want to touch it) said that eventually, whatever is malfunctioning will totally go and then they can fix it (we can only hope).

Other than this, I do like the car.  It has always started and been otherwise reliable.<br><br>
