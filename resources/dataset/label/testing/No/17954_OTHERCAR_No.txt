            I bought a brand new jeep wrangler and the engine blew up in less than two years.  I had owned the jeep for 22 months at the time it brokedown.  The camshaft broke and came through the side of the engine.  I was past the mileage part of the warranty and had to pay the full bill.  The cost of repair was over 3600.00 dollars.  I contacted both JEEP and the dealer since everyone I talked to said that the camshaft breaking must be a manufacturing defect.  This was the most serious of problems that I have had.  I also had to replace the catalytic converter, muffler, and an Oxygen sensor earlier.  The gauges also stop and start working every time I hit a bump.<br><br>
