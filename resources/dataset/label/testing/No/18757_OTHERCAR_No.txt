            <i>...and my designation is Casio WQV-1.</i>

I may not <i>seem</i> well suited to undercover work, with my all-revealing name stamped on my face, but my butt-ugly retro early digital watch look should ensure that no-one gives me a second glance, so they won�t notice the camera. I am so obviously there that my presence is overlooked.

And my camera has been placed very smartly, even though I say so myself. When you pretend to read the time, keeping my faceplate horizontal, you are pointing the lens away from you. This makes it easy for to aim it unobtrusively at the villain you are about to snap. You then make a seemingly careless gesture, as if you are pointing your finger at the number to read the time, and sneakily push the thoughtfully placed large button at the bottom of my faceplate. O yeah, baby, my design is great.

You don�t need to just pretend to read the time either. I am a watch and I <i>do</i> tell the time. I can also tell the date, and offer a stopwatch and five digital alarms for your convenience. I am everything a digital wristwatch is and more. I am the one and only <i>Wrist Camera</i>. Admire me.

Again, to ensure that no one will scrutinise me too carefully, <i>big</i> and <i>ugly</i> are keywords. The big, brash metal band and casing have carefully been complemented with a big, ugly display font for a maximum revulsion factor.

And I am so much more convenient than those silly microfilm cameras. There is no need to develop the pictures. I offer my 120 x 120 (that a whopping 14.400 pixels per picture, don�t tell me you need more) display. I do stark black and white, if that�s your thing, but if you long for more detail pictures of those secret plans, I accommodate you with a 16 different shades of grey. And if you are in a rush, and not able to upload to headquarters, I will gladly remember up to a hundred different pictures for you in my one megabyte memory.

I come with a small infrared adapter that hooks into the serial port of any common desktop or laptop PC. Just line me up with the adapter to upload yours snapshots in seconds thanks to my handsome 115.2 kbps data rate. You will need to install the software, unless you buy two of me, give one to your handsome assistant, beam the pictures to your assistant, and let your assistant deal with that. The good thing about it is that it gives you an excuse to get close, as we really can�t have more than 10 centimeter between us when exchanging data.

I am proud of my proprietary image format and infrared system, but the desktop software will convert to BMP or JPEG if you insist on it. 
You�ll have to buy the <i>Wrist Camera PC Link Software Kit</i> separately, but once you have me, you�ll be so excited that you won�t mind about this miserable marketing trick that makes me seem cheaper than I really am. Smart, eh? But you do get both the cable and the software in a single bundle, so that�s very nice of them, I�d say. They could have sold these separately as well, you know, so I wouldn�t complain too loudly if I were you.
The really smart thing is the proprietary protocol, preventing alien fiends from invading my proprietary system. That�s all to keep you safe from harm.

Impress your camera buddies with my lens specs. Anything beyond 30 cm is sharp, isn�t that great? It simply means that you don�t have think about it. I am like that, very easy to use. It is all because of my smarts of course.
My <i>Average Luminance Control</i> light metering system takes a full screen average makes sure that you don�t have to worry about silly technical details like exposure. My electronic shutter can handle exposure times as slow as 1/11 second and as fast as 1/1660 second. How�s that, eh?

I am not as power hungry as some cameras I happen to know. I want name names, but I do want you to know that I need just a single CR2032 battery once every six months. And I�ll even warn you when it runs low. I manage this amazing battery life thanks to another smart system of mine, the <i>Auto Power saving System</i>. This system detects your movements via the built in Tilt sensor.
O yes, I almost forgot: I also allow you to add small notes to images. Yes sir, I am a real visual data bank.

Please now, don�t walk on. I admit that I have some shortcomings, but they aren�t really shortcomings. Data entry is a bit awkward, and limited to 24 character per image, but how many cameras can do it anyway? So be glad I offer it. Who needs USB if you have serial? Serial is practical, so don�t whimper. My fixed focus is a convenience, really it is. And colour is overrated anyway. Black &amp; white is so much more artsy. Yes, you need plenty of light, but hey, if I featured a flashlight, you would soon find yourself in real trouble, so be grateful I don�t. And of course I�m big - I have been designed for the big boys. I would resent being used by a small-timer. And big boys don�t care about silly things like design, now do they? - or a little bit of weight around their wrist. A mere 32 grams, that�s nothing a real man would complain about.
And please don�t go checking the Casio web site to find that the <i>Wrist Camera PC Link Software Kit</i>, product PAD2-1CR, is currently out of stock. It will be there, Casio promised, isn�t that enough for you?

I am unique. I am the first of my kind. Why wait for colour, more resolution or a price drop? If you buy me now, you can impress all your buddies <i>today</i>. Impressing your buddies is important, so don�t wait till next year. Make an impulse buying decision and choose me now. Please. This warehouse is so cold.
