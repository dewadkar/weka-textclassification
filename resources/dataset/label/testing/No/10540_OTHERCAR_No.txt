                 I'm leasing a 1996 Plymouth Voyager,and I can tell you that it will be the last Plymouth I ever drive again.  My lease started in 1996.  When I first drove the van off the lot it had 55 miles on it.  Pretty good considering that I had already test drove it twice.  For the first year every thing went fine except for it leaked once,but after that it was fine.  The second,and third year however did not go well at all.  First it started leaking more often,then we had a recall that I was never notified for,which was for the gas tank &quot;bumping&quot; around in the back,and I didn't know that until I took it in for a &quot;bumping&quot; noise in the back.  They told me it wasn't a major recall.  I thought that it was.  I've had me transmission recalled and overhauled,timing belts recalled a replaced,my heater has been fixed twice, my wipers fixed three times and they still don't work right.  I traded in a 1987 Olds. with the doors about ready to fall off and it had had less work done to it and it had over 180,000 miles on it.

     I've already had an arbitration done one it and all they gave me was an extended warranty,which is what we wanted in the first place but they never gave it to us.  Right now I have about 53,900 miles on it and I can only go till 63,200 miles before I have start paying for each additional mile.

     I do think that it is roomy inside for the most part,but I only have one bench seat.  It handles great in the snow and rain.  I enjoy sitting up higher off the ground than in a car.  It turns well,and since it's only a four speed I can get 300 miles,if not more,to one tank of gas in the city.  All in all if I didn't have so many problems with it I would recommend it,but I don't.<br><br>
