            I bought a 97 Dodge Caravan in late October of 1997. I needed something plain to haul computer stuff around and the base model Caravan was the cheapest thing that I could find. To be safe I ended up buying Chrysler's extended service contract for 7 years or 100,000 miles. I removed the back seats as soon as I took possession of the van and started to haul my equipment. The van was fine for the first month and then the troubles started. 
First rotors went out twice in the first twenty thousand miles, repaired under warranty. Then the steering column went haywire and the car was in the shop for two weeks while the people at the dealership tried to figure out the problems. At this time it was about March of 98 and I had put 20,000 miles on the car. Problems continued with the timing belt breaking twice after my 36,000 mile warranty expired, gaskets leaking, assorted engine troubles which were explained to me in mechanic talk and hence I had no clue what they were talking about. 
In my opinion the Caravan suffers from reliability problems which are worse than average wear and tear. I like the way it drives and the price was not bad but the hassle of having to take the car at the dealer every month for another mechanical problem takes away any positive views I had for the van. Even though every thing is covered under extended warranty, there is still a $50 deductible out of my pocket every time and I end up wasting a lot of time at the dealership. If you need something cheap to haul not so heavy cargo around, then the Caravan might be a good choice but be wary of it's mechanical problems. <br><br>
