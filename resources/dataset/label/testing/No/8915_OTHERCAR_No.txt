            We bought a 1998 Dodge Caravan brand new from the local dealer.  Before we hit 2000 miles, it was being towed back to the dealer.  The tow truck driver told us that he hauled a lot of these Caravans.  When we got to the dealer, we were told that the internal gas tank gauge was faulty.  Now over 3 trips to the dealer and they never even opened up it even though we had an extended warranty.  I also e-mailed the dealer and Daimler Chrysler and never got an answer.  We filled out all surveys sent to us by Chrysler and the dealer and still never got an answer.

At 10,000 miles, the brakes were shot.  After all the bad service at the dealer, my husband decided to change them himself with the help of our 22 year old son.  My son did the back brakes and was amazed to find a cracked rotor.  The brakes have been every 10,000 miles since then because they wear out this fast.  

Although a comfortable car, I would not advise anyone to purchase one of these vans, especially the 98 model.

Regarding conversion with removable seats.  These seats are very heavy.  My husband is an electrician and hence big and strong.  He has to back the van up to a table in the shop to remove the back seat which only is designed to hold 2 people.  Our oldest son has to help him with the middle seat.<br><br>
