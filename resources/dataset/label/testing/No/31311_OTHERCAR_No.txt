            We bought our 1990 Pontiac Grand AM from Rick Warner Toyota at a special mall sale - cash.  The first 6 or 7 months, it rode smoothly and we were quite happy with it.  Unfortunately, the dream didn't last long.  The car was in physically perfect shape, internal [so we thought] and external, and it looked almost brand new.  Nevertheless, the [initial] internal problems showed up in the form of a bad starter.  I wish that I had paid more attention to the Consumer Reports publications because they had mentioned that this is a main problem with the Pontiac Grand AM.  That cost us more than I would have liked to pay, but felt relieved once it was fixed.

We kept up on oil changes, rotated and changed tires, took excellent care of it and now I feel like I could hang Christmas ornaments on it because due to the car repair expenses, the car is our Christmas.  Okay, we know it's an older model but there are even older models of other cars on the road that run perfectly well. Repairs recently have included holes in the radiator, major problems with the engine, stalling when braking, the list goes on and on. In addition, dealing with the deceitful car dealers from whom we bought it and the car repair shops, what a frustration!  Beware of them from the beginning.

We've appreciated where this car has taken us travelwise, but I'm going to purchase foreign cars from now on albeit I wanted to be as American as possible for the benefit of our economy, loyalty, etc.  Sorry to say, however, that it seems like the foreign countries do tend to make better vehicles.  Hard to admit, but now we own an Elantra and no problems thus far.  And it's used, too.  Carefully consider a Pontiac purchase.  Ford's, we have experienced, are even worse.  Sad but true...<br><br>
