            I purchased a 1992 Acura NSX (automatic) in 1995.  I had traded a 1995 Corvette in on it and almost immediately, I knew I had made a mistake.

Let's start off with the some of the positive aspects of the 1992 NSX.

1) For the most part, it is as reliable as any other Honda (although, as you'll see later, mine was not.)
2) It's looks are superb, even after 10 years without an external design change.
3) It handles wonderfully.  It kind of reminds you of a go-kart actually.
4) It has some nice amenities such as climate control, the option of a built in hands free cell phone (at least is was available in 1992), an optional 6 disc CD changer, and power everything.
5) It gets fairly good gas mileage.
6) It holds it's value fairly well.
7) You'll be the center of attention. (If that's what you want.)

Now for some of the negative aspects of the 1992 NSX, at least as far as I was concerned.

1) IT WAS SLOW!!!  Do not buy this car if you are looking for something that will get you up to super-highway speeds quickly.  Get a Viper for that. (See my Viper GTS review.)  The little 3.0 L 6 cylinder engine is simply not enough for this automobile.  They should have given it at least a 4L V8.  I understand that the 5 speed manual is a little faster, but not much.
2) Everyone that drives up to you on the street wants to race.  Unfortunately, most of them will be able to beat you.  I was beaten by Chevy Impala SS's,  Z28's, Trans Am's, Mustang Cobra's, Corvette's-----they all can out-accelerate this car.
3) The stock Yokohama tires are fairly expensive and do not last long at all!  In fact, they are expected to last 10,000 miles or less.
4) Although it is supposed to be a reliable car, my NSX needed a new transmission at only 29,000 miles.  Cost? $5,000  (And no, it's not because I abused it.  I drove it like anyone would drive it after spending a LOT of money on it.....very gently.)
5) Modifications for increasing power are expensive.  And if you should be unlucky enough to blow the engine, it'll run you well over $10,000 for a new engine.  (I've heard that it was closer to $20,000 but I haven't verified that.)
6) Regular scheduled maintenance runs around $700.
7) The trunk is tiny.
8) The constant attention gets old.  Every time I got gasoline, someone would come up and start talking about it and asking to sit in it.  It's cool at first, but it gets old fast.
9) It is way too expensive for what you get.  The Corvette, for example, offers more power, more features, better gas mileage, better sound (exhaust), and in my opinion, more fun for 1/2 the price.  Heck, a brand new Viper GTS even costs less, and <i>it's</i> and expensive car!

I understand that the newer NSX's with the 3.2 L engine are more powerful and turn more respectable track times.  If I were forced to buy another NSX, I would definitely get the 3.2 L engine.  The 3.0 L engine is woefully inadequate.
