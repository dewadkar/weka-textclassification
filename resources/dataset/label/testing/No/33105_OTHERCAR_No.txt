            I had a full size conversation Van Ford E350 and it was a gas hog. Went looking for the smaller versions and found my 98 Jimmy SLT It has all of the bells and  whistles one could ask for.  Very good price because a Preacher had used it and loaded up 29,000 miles, dealer super clean.  
Now the reason I am not happy, It rides like a log wagon without springs the leather seats are hard like a rock and the carpet has wore through in the drivers area.
Drives well on dry roads hard to handle on wet roads.  
Would I recommend this vehicle to others?  Only if they have there own padding and they believe they must look cool.
