            In early 1998 I bought a new truck.  I liked the room and the fact that it was a 4x4.  It didn't take long for little things to start happening.  At first, within 6 months, the fuel pump went out on it.  I am thankful that I did have roadside assistance and it was taken to the dealer without and problems.  Although, once it was there, it was three days before my truck was fixed.  The next thing that happened was the side mirror cracked down the middle.  Only to be followed by the seat clips breaking and my seat cover coming loose.  It was all covered by warranty, but who want their truck in the shop all the time?  Unfortunately this is not the only things I have had problems with.  About 2 months ago I took my truck in to be serviced, and found out that the tie-rods and the lower ball joints were bad in the front end.  By this time I was out of bumper to bumper warranty and my extended warranty didn't cover all of the parts.  I have had many LITTLE things to happen and they all add up to one BIG problem, I bought a DODGE.  I have checked into the financial side of getting rid of it, but I found another problem, this one was HUGE!  Not only do I own a truck that is falling apart a piece at a time, but, I am also $7,000 upside-down to the nearest trade-in value.  I regret the day that I bought this truck because I simply don't have time to spend in the service department at my local dealership.  <br><br>
