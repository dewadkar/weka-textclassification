            I bought the AWD Safari because of the towing capacity and the seating room.  I loved the van until around 35,000. Please keep in mind that I maintain my vehicles very well.  3,000 oil changes, scheduled maintenance, etc.  Also, the van is not driven hard as I am a Realtor and use the van primarily to show clients homes.  

Around 35,000 miles I noticed a noise in the front end.  I took the van to the dealership, and much to my amazement, the front end needed to be rebuilt, as well as new tires installed (the rear tires were fine), and this cost me around $900.

Then at 38,000 miles I was taking my son to an &quot;away&quot; Ice Hockey game and was traveling along I95 when the van just died.  No warning or anything I was driving on the interstate in heavy traffic, and almost got killed because I lost all power.  The vechicle was once again in the shop and this time it was the altenator.  This cost me only $550!  Well I now have 41,000 miles and am waiting for the next major break.  

I will not buy another GMC product if this is an indication of the reliability, and would not recommend this van to anyone, unless they lease it, and get rid of it before 40,000 miles!<br><br>
