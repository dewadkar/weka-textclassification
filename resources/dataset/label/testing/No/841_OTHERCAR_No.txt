            In 1996, my husband and I were in the market for a 4 door sedan. We test drove all models available in our price range. We were led to the Hyundai Sonata by price, it was $15,000.00 and all of the comparable models were at least $18,000.00, and the abundance of safety features.I was impressed by the numerous safety features offered, many of which were not offered on comparable models (break-away engine mounts, rear defroster as standard, etc.). The week after we bought the car, we had to have the hood, trunk and top re-painted because of small white spots that were developing. It was not sun damage, the car was in the showroom. One year later, the spots started appearing on the surfaces that were not repainted. The Hyundai representative that we were dealing with would not authorize for it to be repainted so we were paid a small sum (less than the cost of a paint job) and required to sign an agreement saying that we would not bother them with paint problems again. In the winter of 1998, the rear window shattered on a cold night for no apparent reason other than the possibility of glass that was not tempered properly. There were 2 other vehicles in the driveway that night with no such problems. A few months later, my father and I checked the rear brakes only to discover that the rear hub cover, covering the bearing, had been cross-threaded at the factory. As a result, the bearing was under strain and had been slowly leaking its lubrication grease the entire time. Evidence of the leakage was what prompted us to pull the cover off. The latest problem we have been faced with is a low resale value. I would not recommend this car brand to anyone and will not buy it again.<br><br>
