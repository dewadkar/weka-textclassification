            I own a 1996 Kia Sportage. It is cute, but it is falling apart and in the four years I have had it, I have tried three different dealer service departments and had problems with every one. I was so unhappy I fedexed a letter to Kia Customer  Service but got no response (that was last August). In April I e-mailed their website and received a reply saying that my complaint would be forwarded to Kia Motors America and I would hear from them within five days. Of course I heard nothing. The latest news is that my supposedly 'rust protected' Kia is not only rusting all over the place outside, but there is rust in the gas tank!  If you are considering the purchase of a small SUV I urge you to avoid the Kia, especially in metro Atlanta where the service is so unprofessional.  I am stuck with mine but the rest of you folks out there can do the smart thing and buy the 'old reliable' Toyota brand or some other decent car instead.<br><br>
