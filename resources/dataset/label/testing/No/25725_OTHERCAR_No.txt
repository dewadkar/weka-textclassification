            We purchased the New Beetle when they had first been released in the US.  It was impossible to resist its distinctive retro-ish styling and sporty feel and handling.

Handling: Superb. This car has excellent suspension, wide, low profile tires, a low center of gravity and low curb weight.  Combine these features and throw in front wheel drive, you've got a car that confidently grips the corners and makes for a fun driving experience.

The New Beetle was fun, but not fast.  The only gasoline engine in the 1999 model year was a 2.0 liter 16v transverse mounted inline-4.  This motor puts out about 110hp and about 120ft-lbs of torque.  It moved the car around well and got 30 miles per gallon but you wouldn't see 60mph in under 10 seconds, even with the manual transmission. 

The tranny in this car was a blast to drive with, very smooth shifting and precise.  The clutch, brakes, and steering all had similar feels...a lot of control behind every instrument the driver can touch.

One place this car shines is in headroom.  The front seat can accomodate very tall people.  I am 5'8" tall and had nearly a foot of room from my head to the ceiling.  The backseat was not nearly as spacious, with it being just right for someone of my stature.  

Trunk space is minimal, but the rear seats do fold down to make it decent.  I wouldn't recommend this car as a cargo hauler.  

Seats: hard.  Very hard.  Not that they were uncomfortable, but they really held you in place for those quick corners you'll be taking.  They had excellent support for good posture, which is very important to me.

One reason we no longer own this car is due to the sport suspension.  It is very fun if you are in the mood, out for a drive, but if you are travelling for an hour or two, it is very bumpy and wears on the shoulders, neck, and back.
It also held a lot of novelty, which wore off once everyone on the block had one.  They are everywhere now and it got old.

The build quality on this car was excellent, the interior and exterior were assembled very well.  There was a recall performed by Volkswagen for faulty wiring and they handled the matter very well.
