            A few years ago I bought a used Toyota Tercel with only 40,000 miles on it.  Unfortunately I didn't find out until AFTER the purchase that in 1990 Toyota experimented with the Variable Venturi carburetor and as a result, carbon builds up in the engine.  They also have a lot of trouble with the exhaust system.  I have had a lot of trouble with my car and wish I'd never purchased it.  It may not have to go to the shop every other week, but when it does go to the shop it always needs serious work.  However, there are a lot of things about my Tercel that I truly love.  I'm a short person (5'1&quot;) and the Tercel is the perfect size for me.  I can reach the pedals and see over the steering wheel without a pillow on the seat. :o)  Unfortunately it doesn't have a lot of legroom for my taller passengers.  It's also a dream to park (although it's so small, it's sometimes hard to spot in the parking lot.)  And even though it runs like crap, it still gets well over 30 m.p.g.  I would purchase a Tercel again.<br><br>
