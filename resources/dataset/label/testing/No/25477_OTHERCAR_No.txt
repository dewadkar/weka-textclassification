            My 1998 Saturn was my very first NEW car. Buying any car is stressful, but buying a brand new car can be particularly difficult. I was attracted to Saturn because of their no-haggle attitude. It is true. Buying the car was as hassle free as possible. 

Our local Saturn dealership did not have a collision center. They had a service center for the basics: oil changes and the like. The outside of the dealership had a huge sign saying &quot;Body Shop&quot;. I took this to mean that they could handle most any situation that would arise. I took out the most comprehensive maintenance agreement that they offered and drove my new car home. 

Not quite six months after purchasing the car, I was in a major accident. I was in the process of moving and a large item fell over, distracting me and I managed to hit an electric pole at a moderate rate of speed. I did nearly $4,000 worth of damage to the Saturn.

Considering the extent of the accident, I am very happy that I was in a Saturn. I was bruised, swollen but otherwise completely fine. Passing cars called for an ambulance when they saw the condition of the car. Every emergency worker that arrived credited the Saturn for my safety. Both airbags deployed and the hood curled up just like they tell you that it will.

While it would seem the nightmare would have ended for me it was only just beginning. I found that the dealership did not have the advertised &quot;Body Shop&quot;. I was told that one was coming in a year or so which is why the sign was on the building. This did little for my poor car.

They recommended an auto shop that got me in right away. However, because Saturn,again, didn't have a body shop they could not supply them with parts. It took an unbelievable amount of time to get the many needed parts. Meanwhile, I was without a car. Frustrated with Saturn for the delays (and for what I felt like was an outright lie about having a bodyshop) I called them daily. Eventually sick of me, they provided me with a rental car.

All in all, it took me over 4 months to get my car returned to me. My advice to you is that you make completely sure that your Saturn dealership has a collision center because it is not easy to get it taken care of elsewhere.
