            I purchased it with 10k miles.  It started out as a great car, good performance, great handeling, and good gas milage.  That 3.4 liter engine would run with the V8's. 
  However, around 75,000 miles, the problems started to apear.  First the alternator,  a 5.5 hour job and expensive part.  Next the AC compressor.  Then the ABS unit went out,  which ended up being a loose screw in the ABS box ($500+ repair).   Then, the window tint started bubling and the interior carpet on the doors started falling off.  The ash tray and lid on center console broke.
   Then finally came the big problem.  The oil filter blew off the block, causing the engine to lock up (turned three main bearings).  After talking with dealers, I found out this is not uncommon.  The stock high performance oil pump has a bypass valve which, if it get cloged, it will over presurize the oil filter. 
  Well, being experienced in auto repair, I decided to rebuild it myself because a long block was $4,000+.  It turns out the 3.4L engine was initially designed as a race engine, and tuned down for the lumina.  I ended up spending over $1,800 for parts on a stock rebuild. Other than normal rebuild parts, here is a small list of parts I replaced: timing belt, water pump, 2 valves, timing belt pully, all motor mounts, alternator bearings, spark plugs and wires, inner and outter tie rods, CV boots, knock sensor, thermastat, and, ideler pully. I even had to have a weld shop make specalized tools for setting the cam timing. 
   $2,500 later, I finally had the car running in top notch condition, or so I though.  Driving down the freeway, the car stop, and woulded start.  After a $60 diagonstic charge, it ended up being a fuse for the fuel injectors.  Then on a vacation trip the AC went out again, and the cruise control fuse went out.  
  This car has been nothing but problems, and every time something goes wrong, the parts are $200+.  Stay as far away from the 3.4 liter engine as possible.  It will break your heart and your bank account.
