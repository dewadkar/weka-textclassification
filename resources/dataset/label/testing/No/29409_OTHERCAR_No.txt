            Wow. When you lay your eyes for the first time on this car you fall in love. What isn't there to love. It has a luxurious look and overwhelming power. Your probably thinking how much can a V6 engine have. Well it goes from 0-100km/h in 7.0 seconds flat. Pushing the car to full throttle it's top speed is 240km/h. Its also a very light car weighing in at a staggering 1250kg. Not very much. The best part of the boxter other then everything itself is, its reasonably price at $58,000(base) fully loaded would come out to approx in the 70's. WELL if your looking for a car here is one.<br><br>
