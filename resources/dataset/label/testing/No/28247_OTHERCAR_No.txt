            When the Dodge Durangos came out my husband was looking for something other than my minivan that will fit all of the children.  We are avid snowmobilers so towing was very important.  So... We bought a 1998 Dodge Durango.  We returned it the next day because the transmission was ridiculously loud and they told us it was SUPPOSED to sound like that!!!!

So, we went to another dealer, hoping for a bit more honesty and integrity and we bought a 1999.  It was in the shop three time for a total of almost 4 months because the rear end blew every time we took it on a trip.  We fought through arbitration/ lemon law and we able to get another one.  A 1999 Dodge Durango SLT.  It has been at the dealership parking lot since March 3 (today is Memorial day).  They replaced the rear end AGAIN, and had to put new lifters and a whole new engine in because one of the pistons had a huge burn in it.  I have been fighting with the dealership, 1400 Motors of Nashua (formerly of Lowell) and Chrysler Corporation for months and they refuse to even attempt to satisfy me.  They offered me my money back, about 75% of what I bought it for!!  When we went through arbitration the first time, I ate the mileage and extra costs involved in getting another vehicle, but due to the fact that this is my third time around, I think it is their turn to stand behind their product,  They aren't.  I would NEVER buy another Chrysler and I am going to try to convince every one I know not to get one either.!!!!!!!!<br><br>
