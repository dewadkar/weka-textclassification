              This is the worst vehicle I have ever purchased.  I purchased the vehicle brand new (1997) and it has been in the shop more times then my old vehicle. 
  I have had to have the front and rear of vehicle repainted several times, spark plugs have to be changed less than 6 months (which the company considers this normal), have to add oil every 600 to 800 miles (company says this is normal), brakes wear out rapidly, engine needs major overhaul, A/C does not work properly, and Air Bags do not work. 
  I was in an accident going 50 MPH and the airbags did not deployed. Can not wait to hear what they say about this. Knowing Dodge...it is normal for a Dodge truck airbags not to deploy at 50 MPH...same old story. Also, the electrical system automatically shut down on me while I was on the Interstate and nearly had a major accident causing me to drive the truck into the median. 
  In addition, I can not use 87 Octane or Regular Unleaded gas. Dodge states that I need to use premium gas or high octane gas.  Another BS story!
  The dealership wants me to buy a new vehicle instead of repairing the truck or trading me for a different truck. I purchased a new truck not to have all the maintenance problems.  So much for that theory.  
  I do not recommend this truck to anyone nor will I never buy a Dodge product ever. They have lost my business and everyone that I can inform about their terrible service and useless warranty. I am currently filing a lawsuit with Dodge in hopes to settle in getting a vehicle that runs properly. 
  This has been a headache and very stressful. I do not trust the vehicle when I travel to see friends, but it is the only vehicle I have. <br><br>
