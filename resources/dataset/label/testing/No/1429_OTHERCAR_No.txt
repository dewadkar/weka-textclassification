            The Dodge Neon is a compact car that provides the driver with ample power and comfort for even the longest journeys. Having traveled from New Jersey to West Virginia in my Neon I can fully recommend it. 

The trip is a ten hour drive. The neon handles well even in the tricky mountains of West Virginia. There is enough acceleration at 55mph to get out of most potential hazards.

Having recently driven in the snow I can also say that I am satisfied with the safety of driving the neon. The car handled well even in the iciest of conditions.

However, add a few 'luxuries' to the car and the price raises a little making the Neon more expensive than on first sight.

I recommend the Neon to families with 2 young children. There is plenty of room to accommodate the whole family and the trunk is surprisingly large. 

Overall I am very satisfied with my Neon.<br><br>
