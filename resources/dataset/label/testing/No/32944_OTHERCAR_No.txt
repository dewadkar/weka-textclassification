            I recently wrote about my first car and I thought I'd take a moment to write about my wife's first car too!

I'm not well known for my car reviews.  OK, maybe I'm not well known at all, but if I am known for anything it is my medical epinions.  Let's face it, that's what I know!

OK, so another step away from my medical epinions, here's a little about my wife's 1983 (or was it 1982?) Mercury Lynx.

A little history about the car... 

Her parents bought it for her when she was 16 years old.  It was a tiny little car, 2 door, hatchback.  I used to call it "the death-mobile" because I was afraid we would die if we ever got in a wreck!  It was an automatic transmission with a floor shift. It had manual windows and door locks, AM/FM stereo with cassette. 

It was tan with tan vinyl interior.  She got it used with 30,000 miles on it and quickly got rid of the vinyl on the front bucket seats.  Your legs would stick to that vinyl stuff!

She drove it through all of high school and 5 years of college (nursing school).  Finally in 1998, we replaced it.

What sort of problems did we have?  I can't name them all.  It had a little 4 cylinder engine and something was desperately wrong with the carbeurator.  Her brother is a mechanic and kept it running for us, but had to set the idle very high (high number of RPM), just to keep it running.

The thermostat died right before we sold it.  The car would stall frequently and many times would not start even when it had a new battery and one of many new starters.  This thing was a big headache!  I wouldn't recommend one of these to anyone!!

In the end, we sold it for $150 and it only had 100,000 miles on it.  We got almost twice that many miles out of my 1983 Olds Cutlass Calais (see my previous review).  

I guess my advice would be the following:  if you want the experience of working on a car all the time and dealing with a car that dies all the time, buy one of these!  I'm sure you could get one cheap....


I guess I'll return to writing medical reviews, that's where I have some expertise. I have listed all of my medical epinions on my profile page for easy access. If you are looking for a specific topic, please look there! 

In the hopes of bringing together good writers and topics, I have started a webring of people who enjoy writing medical epinions. Hopefully, this will help others find medical epinions when they are looking for specific authors or topics. See my profile page for details, then click on the "ring hub" link. Thanks!
