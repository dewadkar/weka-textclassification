<TEXT>
            I own a RAV4 and would like to recommend RAV4's to others out there who are considering buying one.  The vehicle is fun to drive and handles real well in poor terrain conditions.  The only recommendation I would have to anyone is to buy a standard shift versus an automatic shift.  The RAV4 has a very small engine and if you plan on driving up any steep hills the vehicle really does not have the gusto to get up the hills with any great speed.  <br><br>
