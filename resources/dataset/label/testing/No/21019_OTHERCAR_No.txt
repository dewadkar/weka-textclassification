            I really think america is getting bad.  I mean, toyota can market a celica with big tires and call it an SUV.  I would love to see someone take a RAV-4 off road, or even over a curb.  The Nissan Xterra, Jeep Cherokee or Jeep Wrangler would be a far better choice.
The RAV-4 does one thing good, look like a cute little car (notice I did not say truck).  But ask yourself, why spend 20,000 and get so little.  You could get a fully loaded mercury cougar V6, a loaded ford contour, a nicely equipped Honda Accord, and the list goes on.  The RAV 4 would be ok if it cost maybe 14 or 15 thousand.  This car should not be purchased by anyone, especially men.  I would rather drive a old Chevy citation around than be seen driving a RAV-4.  Sometimes I wonder if people in America really think for themselves.
But hey, it does have all-wheel drive and it's kinda cute (although unbelievably slow).
Do yourself and your self respect a favor and buy something else.<br><br>
