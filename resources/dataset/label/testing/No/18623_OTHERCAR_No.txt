            I bought my Alero in September 1999 and I am on my second major repair (at least what I consider to be major).  After six months of ownership, I had to replace the rotors.  Just over my one year mark, I replaced the alternator.  Of course these repairs were covered under my warranty, but what can I expect when I exceed the 36000/3year mark?  This is only the third new car I have owned in my lifetime (I keep my cars an average of 7 years)and I have NEVER had to replace either one of these items before. In addition to these two repairs I've had done, there are little annoyances I have not bothered to get fixed:  sometimes the keyless entry does not function, the CD player skips,the driver's side window makes a loud &quot;clunk&quot; when it I roll it up, and the lumbar support in my seat broke. The car still looks great, but I have serious doubts about the quality of the vehicle as a whole. <br><br>
