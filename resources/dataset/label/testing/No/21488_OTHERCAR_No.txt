            I purchased my 1997 Grand Prix in Feb. of 1997.  I to also have problems with the way this car handles. I have had 3 headlight assemblies put on this car not to mention the suspension problems,alternator has been replaced twice, the trunk leaks, it has had a new water pump put on it,and the interior doesn't last. I mean what is Pontiac thinking when they put out these cars?  Do they only make cars to last for about a year or so? I think that cars should be made to last as long as your payments, which brings me to the point of resale value I can't get out of this car. This vehicle only has 49k mi. on it and the trade in value is only 10k, I am upside down anywhere I go I can't even buy a Kia without having to pay an arm and a leg because of the price they would have to add on.
SOMEONE PLEASE CALL A CONSUMER REPORTER!!!
