            Nice riding car and much power.  Regal owners and others of the 3.8L are prone to premature (40K miles) water pump failures which shows up as leakage.  I have also had the interior door rest fall off.  Certainly not the great quality I am used to with Japanese cars I have owned but all in all not a bad car even if a tad bit old fashion looking for the 1996 model year.

The 3.8L will really move and has plenty of passing power.  Car is very comfy and good for long trips. Seems to have above average reliability compared to other American made cars but not how it will hold up now that I have 67K miles on it.<br><br>
