            I drive a 1996 Cavalier.  I basically chose this car because it was cheap and I heard that it was reliable.  I was moving across the country at the time and was between jobs, so needed a car that wasn't going to cost a lot.  While my Cavalier was not expensive, buying it was still a mistake.  My source that said that the car was reliable was just plain wrong.

The car has been nothing but problems since the beginning, causing several trips to the dealership.  The biggest problem that I've had is that the clutch went out due to a mechanical problem.  The dealership was in no way helpful.  They took an unusual amount of time fix the problem and did not want to give me a rental car, even though the problem was mechanical and covered by my warranty.  The people at the dealership were rude and did not really seem interested in actually helping solve the problem.  In the end, I called customer service at corporate Chevrolet, thinking that at least on a national level they would be concerned with keeping a customer happy.  This was not true either, and they expressed very little interest in the situation and no help whatsoever in resolving it.

If you are interested in a car that will perform well and one in which you can turn to the dealership or car company to help solve problems, this is definitely not the car for you.<br><br>
