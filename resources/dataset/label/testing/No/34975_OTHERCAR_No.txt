            I was helping my mother buy a car.  We looked at several that I thought were perfect for her.  The Mitsubishi Galant is very nice, as well the new Nissan Maxima.  I spent 2 weeks doing tons of research so I could help her make an intelligent purchase.  We looked for cars all day Friday, and then until noon on Saturday when I went bowling.  I made her promise me she wouldn't buy a car while I was bowling.  When I came out of the alley at about 4pm, there she sat with her shiny new Buick.  I was angry.  What I had read about this car suggested it had all the technological advantages of a car built in 1982.  It was not recommended by any of the car magazines I had used to research. On top of all of that, the initial impression I got of the car was that it looked like something drawn out in a few minutes, and immediately put into production.  This car just isn't pretty at all.  I didn't like it from the start, but I wasn't going to completely hate it until I had driven it.  Two days later a few of my buddies and I were driving to Atlanta.  the back seat of my car is a little cramped, so I borrowed our new Buick Century.  The first thing I noticed on the inside was how uncomfortable the seats were.  I said, &quot;theres still a chance it drives well, heck the supercharged Regal is a dynamo, and these are very similar cars.&quot;  I pushed the throttle down.  Nothing.  I tried it again.  Still nothing.  It took me a few moments to realize that you had to push the gas down, hold it, and wait for the car to do anything.  Then I proceeded at a slow pace.  Rather later(about 13 seconds at my guess)when I got the car up to highway speed I noticed that the car vibrates.  To me, this is an immediate turn off.  All cars should be made to drive at highway speed without vibration.  After driving it for a while I began to notice something else that irked me slightly.  When you go into a turn, the car sways very badly.  It tries to continue on in the direction you were going.  The body roll is horrible.  The entire weight of the car causes it to sway in turns even in very slow turns.  The final insult was the power steering.  The closest thing I can compare it to is driving a golf cart.  There is no tension at all from the road.  You can move the wheel back and forth several inches before the car has any kind of reaction.
The only bright spot I found with this car is that it does hold four men(and these guys were pretty big) and all their stuff rather comfortably.
To me that's the only reason to buy this car.<br><br>
