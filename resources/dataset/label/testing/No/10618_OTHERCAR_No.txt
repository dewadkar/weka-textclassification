I really was tricked into buying a Leganza beginning this year. I needed a new car urgently since my Camry was total loss after an accident.

Since daewoo makes a lot of noise here in the Netherlands, I went for a look and the dealer really talked me into buying a Leganza. The huge standard outfit of the car really makes your brain stop working. When I started asking about reliability, the dealer told me not to worry because of the great 3 year warranty. So I went for it...

Now, 11 months later, I realize that the trouble this car gave me so far is even more than what you expect from a car during its complete lifetime.

It started with one of the power-windows which stopped working already the first week. It�s really nice to drive around with an open window in january. It took 3 days to fix it while I had to drive around in a Matiz.
Fixed under warranty.

In March, the car doesn�t start in the morning. Turned out to be a problem with a broken fuel-pump. Fixed under warranty. 2 days of Matiz.

The same month again starting problems because of a faulty spark-plug cable. Warranty.

Then everything went ok for several month�s untill august when I went to France for the holidays. The second day of the holidays, the automatic transmission of the car just says NO. The car didn�t want to move one single centimeter. It took 2 weeks (the rest of our holidays) to fix it and the french dealer didn�t want to return my car before I payed the bill of 3500 guldens (about 1700 USD). So don�t believe a dealer when he is talking about Euro-warranty. It doesn�t exist. In the mean-time I went to court to get my money back for the fixing, but this is still running.

And right at this moment, ... I�m driving Matiz ... since I have again problems with my automatic gearbox.

I�m not a difficult person, but this car is really not worth being built. And now I�m telling as many as possible people not to go for all the luxery because behind this facade hides a car of 0 quality.<br><br>
