            For my background with Honda Accords, please refer to my review of the 1999 Honda Accord sedan.

The Seventh Generation...

Exterior Design:

There's no question that either you will love this design or hate it. Some say it grows on you, other's adore it, but I hate it. It looks too much like a Mercury cougar in a side profile, like a Mercedes from the rear, and is downright goofy looking from the front. The wheels standard on EX-V6 models are lackluster in finish and in general the car is nothing special to look at. As I mentioned in my review of the 99 Accord, however, a car is enjoyed from the inside out.

Interior Layout:

In typical Honda tradition, controls are right where you would expect to find them. However, there can be some confusion if you get have automatic climate control or the DVD-based GPS navigation. The gauges are all new and are electroluminescent, like those in a Lexus. The speedometer is over-sized, though, and you may need to dim the gauges at night because they can be blinding. The window switches are illuminated this year, but the steering-wheel audio controls are not. 

Seats:

I read somewhere that Honda designers spent a lot of time working on the seats. Whatever they went for, they missed, at least in my book. The seats in the coupe are not as comfortable as those in my 99 sedan. However, note that I have not had the chance to sit in the seats of an 03 sedan. The leather in the coupe feels cheap and plasticky, and since it's black, shows wear quickly and easily. If going with an Accord equipped with leather, expect to take better care of black than other colors.

Ride and Drive:

The newest Accord out of Marysville is sure to impress, especially if it's equipped with the 3.0L VTEC V6. The engine pumps out 40 more horsepower than it's predecessor, but keeps the same displacement. The ride is firmer than the last generation, but it doesn't offer any increase in handling ability. If anything, handling ability has decreased. Perhaps that can be attributed to the tires that are designed for comfort rather than canyon-carving. The steering is lighter in the 03 than in my 99 four-cylinder, but the drive isn't any better. The car zips to sixty and provides a nice cruiser, as well. If you like to row your own gears, the Accord V6 coupe is available in a six-speed manual for the first time ever.

Safety Features:

Standard on EX-V6 models are dual front airbags (Dual stage, multi-threshold), dual side airbags with OPDS(Occupant Position Detection System), and side-curtain airbags for front and rear passengers. For accident avoidance, ABS and TCS are both standard. However, if you opt for a four-cylinder EX you lose the curtain bags and TCS. Go for a four-cylinder LX and expect to pay extra for even basic side airbags. The good news is that ABS is now standard on all Accords.

Problems:

The Accord is still a good car, but the seventh generation has brought on some problems not seen in Accords of the past. The V6's are plagued with hard starting/excessive cranking problems. The 03 EX-V6 I am reviewing has this problem, along with many rattles, and some quirks in the fit and finish such as warped molding around the windows. 

Conclusion:

The first Honda that doesn't feel like a Honda is the lasting impression I get from the seventh generation Accord. It's a bargain when resale is factored in, comes loaded with few options, is quick, and will almost certainly age gracefully. Yet, I'm left wishing that Honda had not taken things so far in one redesign. I regret to say this, but I won't be buying a new Accord. I'll enjoy my 99, perhaps get even a 2002, but the 03+ Accord is simply not for someone who loves the conservative nature and appearance of previous Accords. Maybe it's the entire package of the Accord because I like the TSX and even the new TL. Oh well, perhaps it's Acura or Toyota from here on out for me.

As a final note: Those considering the Accord should look closer at the 2004 Toyota Camry SE-V6. The all-new 3.3L VVT-i V6 debuts this year and the Camry provides a better ride, better fit and finish, and better handling.. All at a similar price.
