            I had a 1990 Sonota till it rained really bad one year and the rain leaked through the cracks in the car destroyed the interior. I had it in the shop at least 4 times a year, including replacement of a lower control arm which meant that the car could not leave the shop till it was fixed because of saftey problems. The automatic door locks and windows worked only when the wanted too, which was about 30% of the time. Tires wore out quickly because bad alignment which had to be fixed a couple of times per year at $150 a piece, brake that always wore out. If you have never seen a &quot;Lifetime Alignment Offer&quot; at a mechanic shop it's because this car made them lose money, and my parts store stopped replacing my lifetime brake pads after two years because I wore them out 4 times.<br><br>
