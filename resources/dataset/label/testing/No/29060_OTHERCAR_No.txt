            I bought this car in 1995 (it is a 1992 model).  I wanted a reliable mid-size car that was safe to drive.  When I bought my Corsica, it had 39,000 miles on it.  I've put about 11,000-12,000 miles on it per year since then.

The paint is chipping, as seems to be the case with many Corsicas, but overall the car still looks nice, and I have always felt very safe driving it.  The V6 engine has fuel injection and plenty of power.  In between repairs, it's a beautiful car--runs nice and smooth and is extremely comfortable.  I'd say that I've put about $3000.00 worth of repairs and maintenance into it over the past five years.  You can judge for yourself whether or not that's reasonable for a car you are considering owning.

At 52,000 miles, I had to replace the water pump, the serpentine belt, and the thermometer.  There were also a couple of leaking hoses which needed to be replaced.  I had an ongoing problem with overheating after those repairs were made, and had to have an electrical switch replaced for about $350.00 (at 92,000 miles).  The battery has died at least 3 times for reasons that are still unclear; I've replaced it and things have been fine for about 20,000 miles(must be another electrical glitch). I also had to replace the alternator at about 80,000 miles, and at 96,000 miles the car is getting some oil leaks.
