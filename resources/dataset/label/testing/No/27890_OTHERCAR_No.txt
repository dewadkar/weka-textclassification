            Like most young men, I never thought I'd be a parent by the time I turned 23.  But that's exactly what happened to me.  I had just bought a Honda CRX when I met the girl who would become my wife.  I had to sell my CRX and buy a new car as soon after we were together we were expecting a baby.  The problem was I owed more than the CRX was worth so I was stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I found myself at the Toyota dealership in North Hollywood, CA in February '97 pleading with them to help us.  The only car they could get us into that we could afford was the 96 Suzuki Esteem.  It seemed nice enough, small sedan with a four cylinder engine so we went for it.

I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED DOING ANYTHING MORE IN MY LIFE.  First of all, the car had 36,000 miles on it.  So one would assume it should still be in great condition right?  WRONG.  The car had absolutely no power and with the air conditioning on, the car barely moved.  No exaggeration, it barely moved!  It actually was dangerous trying to make a left turn on a busy street with this car with the air on.

After a year I had to replace the tires.  When I took the car in to the tire shop, they told me the alignment was off very badly.  I had this serviced along with the tires all for about $300.

Then only a few weeks later the car began driving even slower than it normally did.  As if this wasn't bad enough, I was driving down the street when I heard what I thought was an explosion, then instantly the car died.  I thought the engine had blown up.  I had AAA tow me to a shop where the mechanic found that the bolt that holds the timing belt in place had broken off.  Luckily the bolt didn't do any major damage other than tearing off the belt and cracking the belt cover.  However, after replacing the bolt the car still wouldn't start.  He had to do a major tune-up on the car.  He told me that he had never seen a car so new have it's timing off so much.  $300 later the car was running again.

Six months later, same thing, the car was driving horribly again.  I had the car towed back to the same mechanic where he found the problem.  Yet another broken bolt, this time the bolt that holds the pulley into place from the crank shaft.  Again, $300 later, the car was running again.

The car still only had 60,000 miles on it!  I called the Toyota dealership who told me to call Suzuki.  I called Suzuki of Santa Monica and was told that they were no longer a Suzuki dealer!  So I found the next Suzuki dealer in Culver City.  They told me to bring the car in and they would "check it out".  I work for a living so I couldn't drive 30 miles away and give up my car so I turned them down.

Now four months later I began hearing a grinding noise on the right hand side of the car.  Again I took the car into the shop.  I had a bad cv joint on the car.  The only place to get the replacement was at the dealership.  The part alone cost me $180 then another $120 to have it installed. The mechanic told me that a car with only 60,000 miles should not need this replaced.  Again, $300 later, the car was working again.

Finally in March of 2000 I had finally paid the car off.  I immediately sold the hunk of junk.  I only feel bad that some sorry person will buy this from the dealership I sold it to and have the same experience I had with that horrible car.

Never again will I ever own a Suzuki.  When I see their commercials for cars like the Grand Vitara I want to throw something at the screen.  Do yourself a favor and never buy a Suzuki.  I was told by my mechanic that they are worse than Hyundais.  I've learned my lesson.
