            In the summer of 96' my family traded in our old cars and bought two brand new dodge neons.  At first they were great, we paid under $24,000 for the two of them combined!  We live in the foothills, so we needed these cars to be commuters for the curvy roads.  However, I was stranded after only 6,000 miles with a blown out tire.  The tire had been worn thorough the rubber and completely bald!  I never thought of checking the tires after only 6,00 miles!  Needless to say, neons are not good at cornering.  

Other than the tires, we never had any big maintenance problems until the year that the warrantee expired.  This year we have had bother cars in the shop with major oil leaks, that almost cause us to replace the entire engine!  These cars have a lot of miles, but not that much!  Even now, after the $800.00 over haul, the check engine light pops on.

These cars look nice, and are affordable, but I would never buy a used

or buy one that I wanted to keep any amout of time at all!<br><br>
