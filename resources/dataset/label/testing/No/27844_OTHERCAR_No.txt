                I think people tend to make stereotype judgments when they see Japanese cars : They are all reliable and well built, they are all smaller than domestic cars, they have funny names, they don't use "cheap plastic" for the ergonomics and so on, However Mitsubishi Galant misses couple of important remarks of other top Japanese car makers like Toyota and Honda. 

    My aunt's first car was 1997 Mitsubishi Galant with about 36,000 miles on it for 13,200 US dollars, which is considered quite low mileage for a "Japanese car". It was fully equipped with Infinity sound system with CD player, leather seats, climate control, power everything, power moonroof, automatic transmission but no V-6 engine is offered, although the 4 cylinder is pretty peppy, producing 141 horsepower, compare to best selling Toyota Camry producing 125 hp (1996 4 cyl.) but Camrys can be equipped with powerful V-6 engine (1996 188 hp). 
    
    Yes, powerful engine is important and fun but the main reason why the Camry became the best selling car in the U.S. was not because of its powerful engine but because of its proven Japanese reliability, So people would probably think that Mitsubishi Galant would be reliable as well since it's a Japanese car. That was my aunt's biggest mistake, her car had brakes problem within 2 months of her purchase. I was told that the brakes were replaced when she first bought it but the front brakes and rotors were prematurely wearing out and about 3 months after that, she had problems with the transmission but I wasn't told the details, So I decided to borrow my aunt's Mitsubishi Galant for a test drive. 

    <b>Ride Quality</b>
    Mitsubishi Galant brings unremarkable ride quality, you can feel all the small bumps and big ones can be quiet upsetting to the passengers. You hear excessive wind noise even at slow speed. Seats are not very pleasing either, perhaps because of the overwhelming nasty ride quality. Toyota Camry is an alternative, brings one of the smoothest ride. 

    <b>Design</b> 
    The Galant is pleasing to eyes, redesigned interior is very pleasant to look at. Climate control is easy to operate and handsome to look at, however the buttons for the CD player is small and not easy to read. Ergonomics look very modern and exterior is modern looking as well. Honda Accord is an alternative with handsome style, nice interior, supreme reliability as well. 

    <b>Performance</b>
    Only one engine is available, I-4 2.4 liter, producing 141 hp. I found the Galant relatively sporty but Nissan Altima produces more horsepowers with 4 cyl engine and it is another alternative if you are looking for sporty sedan with less money. 
  
    <b>Safety</b>
    The Galant cannot be equipped with side air bags, Traction control nor stability control are not offered. 1999 Sonatas are standardly equipped with side-air bags.

   I just had to do some research on Mitsubishi cars. They are Japanese car company for sure but how come they are such a troublesome?...This record of <b>J.D. Power and Associates 1997 Initial Quality Study</b> clearly shows that Mitsubishi had more problems than any other Japanese car makers except Suzuki.

    What was more surprising to me was that in the year 1999, <i>(which was the year that current Mitsubishi Galant had debuted, picked for the best mid-size sedan of the year by Car and Driver...umm?)</i> had even more problems than year 1997. ( http://www.flyingcircuscars.com/jdpowers.htm )
 
    <b>Value</b>
    As you have read, I did some research on Galant and I personally believe that they are other Japanese cars that are much capable than the Galant because the Galant isn't reliable nor it stands out of the crowd. Used Camrys, Accord or even Mazda 626 will probably last longer with relatively similar price. 

   Thank you for reading my review, any questions can be answered ~ email me - ooashuraoo@aol.com and good luck if you are shopping for your next car!
