            I recently wrote a review of my husband's work vehicle a Dodge Intrepid.  I liked the car because it was roomy and had a lot of power.  My husband got a new vehicle for work and had to turn in the Intrepid.  His new work vehicle is a Chevrolet 1999 Lumina.  

This car is looks nice from the outside.  The Intrepid had a lot of room and the seating inside was comfortable.  The Lumina does not have nearly as much room.  The Lumina does not handle as well in my opinion.  It is not as responsive as the Intrepid when taking corners or braking.  The following is a list of how the vehicle operates and some of its positives and negatives:


�<b>SIZE</b>

The vehicle is a compact to mid-sized vehicle.  It is a four door vehicle that will seat four adults somewhat comfortably.  The trunk has adequate room.  Seating width is somewhat restricted.  The seats feel boxy and when I sit in them I feel like I am being restricted.  The rear seat will hold two adults or three children comfortably.  Three adults in the rear would be very uncomfortable.  Rear seat leg room is very cramped.  The front seats are comfortable but as I said, boxy.  The front leg room is very shallow in depth.  A tall person with long legs would not be comfortable in this vehicle.


�<b>CONTROLS AND VISION</b>

The vehicle instruments are easy to access and easy to use.  The air-conditioner/defrost/heating system is user friendly.  The controls allow which system to select, the amount of heat or coolness, and the amount of air flow to be regulated.  

The radio/cassette player in this car is adequate.  It sits in the lower middle portion of the dashboard and it can be distracting, for the driver, to change because of the position it is in.  The radio speakers and the system sound good when it is played.  

The speedometer and tachometer are easily seen.  The lighting system is easy to use and access while driving. The emergency brake is a foot pedal type, that is easy to put on and take off.  

The vehicle has very good visibility.  The obstructions are very limited and it is easy to see over the hood and around the various roof and door posts.  The mirrors allow good vision to the sides and rear.   


�<b>POWER/HANDLING AND ECONOMY</b>

The vehicle has a very good response when you give it the gas.  It accelerates quickly and the braking system is very responsive. The steering is somewhat sluggish and it is not as responsive as the Intrepid.  The vehicle corners acceptably and it feels that it grips the road as you turn a corner.

One gripe about the vehicle is the <b>Fuel Economy</b>.  The vehicle gets about 200 miles off of a full tank of gas.  It seems to burn a lot of gasoline.  In today's gas prices that is not a good thing.  Right now my husband is getting about 15 miles a gallon.  That is not very good mileage for a small to mid-size vehicle.  Thank goodness the company pays for the gasoline because we would not be able to afford it.

Overall the vehicle is adequate.  I wish the gas mileage was better.  That is my one gripe about the vehicle. In defense of the vehicle the previous two drivers liked it and it was only in the shop once for a minor repair. <br><br>
