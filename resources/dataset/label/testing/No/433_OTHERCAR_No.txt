            I bought my V70 because of its easy handling, good acceleration, and the Volvo reputation for safety. In these areas, it doesn�t disappoint. The V70 is a full-size wagon with comfortable seating fore and aft and adequate cargo space. Not battleship-sized, it�s easy to park almost anywhere, a feature I particularly appreciate when driving in town. Its maiden voyage (the day after I took delivery) was a six-day trip from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. The car performed well: good gas mileage, comfort, noise, acceleration and speed, maneuverability. The excellent sound system helped alleviate the monotony of hours behind the wheel.

Additional features I appreciate are the layout of instruments, adjustable steering wheel, and programmable driver�s seat position settings. The sedate factory-installed security system doesn�t beep to alert others in the parking lot that this car is now unlocked.

Little things are annoying: the intermittent wiper setting isn�t adjustable, the turn indicator doesn�t stop automatically until I turn the steering wheel completely back past the neutral position. And little things go wrong: turn indicator lights burn out quickly, as do headlights. The ignition switch recently had to be replaced.

The V70 is a good family car, but as a single mom whose children are now on their own, I think I�ll trade it for a Celica.
