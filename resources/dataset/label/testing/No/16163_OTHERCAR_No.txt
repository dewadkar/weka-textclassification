            For those of you who read my last article about the Audi S4, should know that we also had a Ferrari F355 F1 for Saturday's drive.  This guy paid 150K for the car, with the only option being the &quot;Exhaust System&quot; for an extra 3K.  He paid 5K for mark up.  He told me that this is like the LAST one left around the West Coast, and the F1 shift is just SO HOT that everyone wants it.  For those of you who don't know what the F1 is, basically, it's the CLOSEST thing to the shift on those million dollar F1 Formula cars that you will EVER DRIVE for clutchless shift.

     I drove the Porsche Tiptronic shift before, and basically, it's just a joke, just like the BMW 7 Series where you can shift on the steering wheels.  For the F1, it's TOTALLY different, this thing shifts as fast as a clutch shift car.  And the sound that 3K exhaust system he has just totally worth it.  It's not as loud as the &quot;minimum sound&quot; Tri-Flow exhaust but the deep throaty sound just makes you fall in love with the car right away.  Alright, no time to write, will have another one on this later on.  Thanks for reading...  Oh, one last note to the Italian craftsmanship, the guy had his top down, and guess what happened when he tried to return his seat back to normal, it got STUCK...the car only has 800 miles too, this tells a lot about what you're paying for that 150K, 100% style, 0% comfort and reliability...  Sorry, another last note, for those of you who haven't driven or seated in a F355, you can not move the seat forward or backward, it's pre-set, the factory basically will measure your height and adjust for you to the most optimal distance...<br><br>
