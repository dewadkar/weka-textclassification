            About 6 months ago, I purchased a used Galant because everyone said all these wonderful things about them.. And last week on my way to work it felt like someone rear-ended me, and when the light turned green, my car went nowhere. All I could do was thank god I was on an incline and roll backwards into a gas station parking lot. When the tow truck guy and my mechanic showed up they said my transmission had gone byebye.. gee great news for me. I know that this doesn't happen to everyone, but my car for the last 4 months (out of my 6 month ownership) has been in and out of the shop roughly 18 times. Even the local Dealership said it was running fine, and passed all their &quot;inspections&quot; this was 1 day before the transmission that they had JUST tested went byebye on me. My transmission wasn't even half of my problems, the a/c went out 3 weeks after having it - in mid summer - Texas style. The front end needed work (and not because I'm a careless driver), because the U-Joints were going bad. My car rests in peace with 45,000 miles... In my driveway.. And to top everything off everywhere I went for an estimate on a new transmission they told me it would be $2,000 at best for replacement, because there is no saving it. The dealership said it would be roughly $3,000 before labor. My best friends Mother is still driving her 95 Galant and has been since I graduated High School... So I figured &quot;hey this is a good car&quot; boy was I wrong. Used Galant's... stay away :)
*The one thing my galant did to me that really annoyed me is
last week, for some obsurd reason... the horn stopped working...
Took it to the dealership.. they said &quot;nothing was wrong&quot; but hellooooo my horn still didnt work.. but there were no blown fuses. Whats up with that? Anyway.. :)<br><br>
