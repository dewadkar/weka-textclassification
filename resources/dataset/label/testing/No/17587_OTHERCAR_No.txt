            Prior to owning a Toyota Tacoma extended cab I owned a Toyota 4 Runner.  The 4 runner was a well built dependable vehicle that was worth the money.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the Tacoma.  While it is functional for its day to day usage, it is underpowered when it comes to hauling heavy loads or towing anything.  The 4 cylinder version of the truck is basically gutless.

The extended cab is good for extra storage but is not functional for extra seating.  The spare tire jack is stored in the extended cab and is very hard to get out of its storage compartment.  Whomever designed the spare tire storage compartment should be fired.  I cannot see any reason why they shouldn't have made the area bigger and easier to access.

I was also very disappointed in the Toyota dealership when I wanted to turn the car in early on my lease to purchase a new vehicle.  Usually you would think they would want to work with you since you want to get a newer car but they were not at all interested in giving me a fair deal on getting out of my lease.  Based on my experience I do not think I will ever own another Toyota truck again.<br><br>
