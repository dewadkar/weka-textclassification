            I only had a couple more weeks of my three and a half year stint in Japan, and I knew that I had better make up my mind quick.  Japan is a technophiles dream, and digital cameras are no exception.   At the time, I owned an Olympus, and had extensive experience with the Fuji 6800Z, Sony Mavica and a Casio 1 Mega Pixel.  I had consumed all the information I could find about my top choices, so I was relaxed and confident as I wound my way through the narrow roadways of the Japan countryside.  Little did I know that Nikon had just a few days before released a new camera that was would make me question all that I had planned. The English press had yet to hear about the Nikon 880 � and since I had used these English sources for my research, I wasn�t nearly as prepared as I had thought.

Please join me as I return to September 2000, standing in Niigata�s Yodobashi Camera, knowing that I had better make up my mind quickly.  I drew up a list of things that are important to look at in a camera.  Everyone has their own needs, so I think it is important to individually prioritize these things.  

<b> Photo quality. </b>
  <i>Pixels</i> � Do you need all the pixels?  Will you be enlarging your photos?  My minimum was a 2-mega pixel � as I bring my memory card in to get my prints developed, and like to be able to zoom/crop knowing I have enough pixels left to print with.
  <i>Indoor</i> � I loved the Fuji cameras � in my opinion they have the best options, but I am always put off by their indoor colors and quality.  If you want an incredible outdoor camera, with MP3 player/video etc� consider the Fuji.  Since I planned my camera as an all around camera, I needed decent quality indoor shots, and have been pretty happy with the 880.
  <i>Outdoor</i> � The 880 performs well with outdoor shots, but not as well and consistently as I would like.  I use the Fuji camera if I know I will be taking lots of outdoor shots.
  <i>Night/low light</i> � the 880 takes really interesting low light shots.  This is one of the things I love about digital cameras � you can play around without worrying about wasting photos.  I love trying out shots at night, and with a tripod (or resting it on something) the 880 is much better than other cameras I have used.
  <i>Action shots/tripod shots</i> � Luckily for my photos, my life is quite sedentary, because this camera is almost useless (as most digital cameras seem to be) for action shots.  Usually the event has passed long before the camera actually snaps the photo.  Trying to learn the timing of it is an exercise in futility.  Snapping action shots of a fish being reeled in is ok, but timing that one timer from the point, or the F1 car racing past is going to be as likely as the Lotto 649.  
  <i>Add on lenses</i> � This camera can take add on lenses.  This factor, as well as the video and batteries, pushed me away from the Canon and into the 880 camp.  A year later, I have no add on lenses, hate the video incapabilities and often wish I had chosen differently.
<b>Ease of use </b>� This camera is quite easy to use.  Mind you, its idiosyncrasies make it a challenge for many people � I find that when other people take photos with it, they often end up being deleted (I would say usually but my wife/friends might read this!).  They aren�t holding the camera steady enough, or think the photo has been taken and start moving too quickly, etc�   
<b>Advanced controls/settings</b> � the 880 has enough advanced controls to make me very happy.  I don�t know/understand 75% of them, but when I am at the lake relaxing, it is fun to play around and learn them.  If you are like me, and you enjoy playing with your gadgets, it is nice to know they are there.  
<b>Speed </b>- not shutter speed, but moving around menus, viewing photos, deleting etc�   If you have a lot of patience, this camera might be good enough for you.  I go crazy waiting for the menus to change, the video clips to save, the thumbnails to draw, etc�   While in the store, I was unknowingly playing around with the camera in the basic quality setting (You have the choice of file size/pixel/compression level � Hi, Fine, Normal or Basic).  That meant that it seemed prompt and responsive, but I keep my camera in fine mode, as I need the extra pixels. I would like to take more in �Hi� mode, but I wouldn�t dare do it as I would go bald pulling out my hair waiting for the camera to finish reading/writing. 
<b>Size/weight</b> � this camera is a nice balance of size/weight.  It is quite light, so my wife doesn�t complain too much about it being in her purse.  
<b>LCD</b> - how much do you expect to use your camera to view pictures.  In my case, I didn�t expect to use it as much as I do � but it seems every time I take it out it gets passed around.  It is also important to have good colours � if I am running out of space (happens all the time on my 128 MB card) I will often look through the pictures and delete the ones that didn�t �work�.   To do this properly, you need a good LCD.    Also, outdoor shots are often difficult to see on poor quality LCD�s.  I thought it was important to have a viewfinder (the 880 has one), but in a year I have only used it about 3 times, as the LCD quality is great. 
<b>Image Annotation </b>- do you want to be able to write/record comments on the photos you take?  �Typing� notes, renaming the files, or recording audio clips can do this.  If you do, this camera isn�t for you.  
<b>Memory Type </b>- I had been using SmartMedia memory with my previous Olympus camera, and diskettes with my Mavica.  I knew that I wanted to avoid these.  I had CF cards/modems etc. for my PDA.  Buying big memory cards is expensive (even more expensive a year ago when I bought), so it is nice to buy something that you think will be around, and might even be useful for other purposes.   A year ago I believed that CF was the best of the available choices � I haven�t seen anything to change my mind, although I am very disappointed that the digital video cameras that I want to buy don�t seem to ever use CF.  But that is another story�
<b>Batteries </b>- I wanted a �standard� format that, if needed, I could go to a convenience/camera store and purchase a backup battery.   The 880 uses the standard Nikon battery, so any camera store around the world will be able to help you out of a pinch.
<b>Zoom Lens </b>� the 880 has a 2.5x optical zoom.  Don�t ever use the digital zoom on this or any camera.  Turn it off, keep it off.  This zoom lens is ok.  Is there ever enough zoom?   I don�t think so � but you have to draw the line between the zoom lens and the size.  2.5 does it for me.  


<b>Things I love about my 880</b>

- takes occasional great shots
- a nice balance of size/weight/ergonomics.
- the battery charger is convenient.  It is completely separate from the camera, so you can recharge batteries while continuing to use the camera, and you can plug in the camera and use AC at the same time.  I highly recommend purchasing this option, and at least two batteries.
- Multilingual capability.  I can switch between many languages. 
- The scene mode can be handy � although I almost never use it.  If you don�t already know, the 880 offers 11 preset scenes (portrait, party/indoor, night portrait, beach/snow, landscape, sunset, night landscape, fireworks, close up, copy, backlight.   These have the potential to be handy, but don�t make the mistake I made and assume that they will work.  The Party/Indoor shots generally look horrible.  Auto usually turns out a better shot.  I like the ability to save my custom settings (CSM)-   I find that usually when taking low light shots, it �mottles� the textures on walls etc.  So I flip between auto and CSM to avoid this.  I thought I would use these scenes all the time, but have found they are only useful when I see that the �auto� setting didn�t work and I start to play around a little.
- The �quick view� feature is great.  This feature lets you preview a tiny version of your last shot (or previous shots) while you are still in picture taking mode.  None of that flipping back and forth between viewing and shooting.  This is particularly important for this camera, as it is quite slow switching modes.


<b>Things that bug me about my 880</b>

- Lacking sound for the video.  I was an idiot when I bought this, because I just assumed that the video options meant that it would do audio as well.  Silent movies anyone?  This feature is made even more useless thanks to the unbearable speed that it takes to record.  By the time my camera has finished recording a 30 second video clip, I have missed another 10 good shots, and the battery is almost dead.  After the first week of playing, I haven�t touched this useless feature.
- No automatic lens cover � people always turn it on with the lens cap on � bad bad bad, as the lens bumps into the lens cover.
- Very slow to review/redraw photos and save video clips, unless using it in basic photo mode.  Of course, basic photo mode seems kind of silly when you own a 3.3 Mega Pixel camera.  
- Many of the features are too cumbersome/slow to use regularly.
- Battery life is very weak.  I bought the battery charger and two batteries.  That was a year ago.  One of my batteries lasts me for a single shoot (about 25-40 photos), and the other about 25% more.  
- Clicking noises.  The constantly active auto focus has a �chatter� to it, which freaks some people out when they are using it.  It sounds cheap.
- The battery is in low mode for a long time.  Too early.  When it goes into low power mode it keeps powering itself off at annoying times (eg: after you take a photo, if you leave it on for a few seconds without doing anything, etc.).  You can usually get a solid 20 more photos during this annoying low power mode, but it is useless to give it to someone to use during this time, as it takes forever between powering on and off.
- My camera�s photos often have too much red.  Peoples cheeks look abnormally flushed, lips are accentuated etc.  I contacted their support about this (in Canada) and they were absolutely unhelpful.  I was very angry after dealing with their support � but I contacted the U.S. support department and they were much more helpful.  They wouldn�t fix it though � so I am forced to correct them with software�


A better camera, and the one I would give a recommendation to, is the Canon G1.  I will do a review of it soon, but in a nutshell I like its speed better, video is MUCH better, and the moveable LCD is fantastic.  I have taken both cameras to many important events (eg: weddings�) and have done lots of side-by-side comparisons.  The photo quality is very similar to the 880 � with slightly truer colour on the G1.

I have often been surprised at how little is written about this camera.  It isn�t nearly as promoted as many other cameras  - perhaps because it only fits a very specific niche.   My recommendation is, if you want all the bells and whistles, go for the G1 or the 995, don�t go halfway and get the 880.  If you want point and click and portability, go with the S110.
