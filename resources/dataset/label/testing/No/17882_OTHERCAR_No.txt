            I have been a dedicated Chevrolet driver since 1979. When I went out to
buy a new/used car, I thought to myself that it was time for a SUV. So I
choose the Blazer (1997 LS). The truck has got both pro's and con's. Let's
start with the pro's. It gets 22 miles to the gallon on the freeway. Not
bad considering the size of the engine (4.3L). The engine size gives it
lots of power for getting away from both the slow and the crazy drivers.
The cost was also a plus. Listed for 17,900 at Car Max. Now for the con's.
At 69,000 miles the transmission went out. Thank God for my extended
Drive Train Warranty. I also have something wrong with the Accelerator
Pedal linkage. It sticks sometimes. Also my Gas gage reads incorrectly.
The lower the fuel level, the more the gas gage reads. I once got to a 
gas station on vapor and the gage read half a tank. Anyone who is looking
for a little more quality in a truck should veer away from the Blazer.<br><br>
