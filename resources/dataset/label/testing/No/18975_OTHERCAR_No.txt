            I'm a college student and finding a reasonably priced used vehicle took a bit of looking around.    Picking the GMC Sonoma was primarily my parents' decision for price and color.   The model I have is a '95 extended cab, purple in color.   

It is a decent truck for the buck.   I got it when it had 82,000 miles on it.   Now, I've got over 90,000 miles on it.   I use it to commute back and forth to my college campus plus driving about 240 miles round trip to home and back, give or take an occasional visit to my fiancee.   It serves me well.   I can get on average 350 miles to a tank without the air conditioning.   With it I only get a little over 300 miles.   

Several drawbacks I've had while I've had it have been substantial.  I've only had it since July 1999.    In a span of nine months I've had a few things have to be fixed.  The biggest problem that occurred was having to completely replace my stick shift transmission since it went out on me.   Luckily I was close to home when it went.   That alone cost around $1200 and could've been more had I not gotten the parts for a reasonable price and happened after only at most five months of having the vehicle.   

I've also had to fix a flat tire, have my windshield wipers fixed due to a fault with the manufacturer, have the battery replaced, the air conditioner has gone out, and having to realign the wheels.   The wipers would sometimes not come on after flipping the controls.   Not a good thing when driving along and a sudden heavy pounding rain hits.   All you can really do is pull over to the side of the road and sit it out because trying to drive when unable to see anything really isn't a good thing.   It is a bit of a bumpy ride and slides somewhat easily when turning on a wet pavement, usually due to a decent rain storm.   Going over bumps can easily be felt.

However, you can still maintain relative control of the vehicle without much maneuvering.   It helps to have a weighted down bed.   I have used it to carry decent loads between home and college, usually a full bed and interior on the extended cab.   Whenever I've hauled a load with my truck it has handled well and relatively no problems in that area.

The extended cab gives little room for comfort for anyone sitting in the back.   It is fairly cramped, especially with two people back there.   One thing that does concern me is the fact that the passenger seat doesn't lock into place when upright.   If I slam on my breaks or have a load in the back, the seat has a tendency to move forward due to weight hitting it from behind.   If someone is sitting there to counteract the weight then it is okay but otherwise you have to be careful when breaking for fear of having stuff in the back coming forward.

Overall, this truck is okay.   It has some major issues that hopefully have been fixed in newer models.   However, it will get you where you need to go and is able to transport a decent amount of cargo for it's relatively small size.<br><br>
