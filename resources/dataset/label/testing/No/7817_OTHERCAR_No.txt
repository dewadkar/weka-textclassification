            At first, I had minimal problems, mostly cosmetic, but it was only when I didn't expect it that my car started having all sorts of problems.  

The exact model I own is a two door, SC2, twin cam, 1994 gold Saturn. I bought it used 2 1/2 years ago from the Saturn of Plano Dealership in Texas.  The people at Saturn of Plano may be nice, but their mechanics are some of the worst I have ever encountered! They have never done repairs quickly or efficiently.  

My car only has 39,000 miles on it, and it has had a countless number of problems! First, it was just little things like a tail light, but then it turned into alarm problems, several battery problems (I have had my battery replaced three times since I bought the car - two of them were completely out of my control as far as the cause of the battery dying), and a recent problem with the alignment.  

The Saturn of Plano dealership's mechanics were too incompetent to notice that my alignment was off by a lot! One of the tires was an inch behind where it was supposed to be! All Saturn told me was that I needed to get it looked at where I had the tires put it (NTB).  They were very nice and helpful. They inspected and found the exact problem with my car.  I then had to take my car to a special alignment shop to get it fixed.

For as little mileage as my car has, it has had way too many problems! I added up all of the money I've had to spend on repairs for the past 2 1/2 years, and it comes to about $2,000! I will never buy another Saturn again! We should all just face it - GM doesn't make good cars! <br><br>
