            I was so lucky to receive the flashy, exciting, beige Malibu as my rental car from Enterprise, the pick-you-up-when-we-get-around-to-it company (read my review).  What a trip I was in for.

From the outside, I guess this thing isn't too bad.  The body style is closer to the Japanese imports I'm used to than most of the rapidly-dating designs Chevy puts out.  Unfortunately, that's were the not too bad part of the car ends.

I tried to give this car a chance.  Okay, pickup off the line isn't too bad, but I expected more from a 3.1L V6.  The seat is halfway comfortable, but i find myself sliding around because the sides are not bolstered at all.  And the handling... it's horrendous.  I drive an Accord coupe, and while I realize this thing is not designed for cornering, it's just unbelievable.  It handles like a pregnant elephant.

And just like every other Chevy, it has the quality I dislike the most: every thing on the inside feels and looks cheap, cheap, cheap.  The gear selector looks like I could snap it right off.  The ignition rattles back and forth when I put the key in.  The climate control knobs wobble back and forth, and the buttons are mushy and uncertain.  At least this one doesn't have the turn signal + wiper + cruise control stalk.  But what's with the tacky, carbon-fiber wannabe plastic panel on the dash?  It's like they got them on discount and wanted to find something to do with them.

The car is roomy, and the trunk surprisingly so.  Like I said, the pickup is decent off the line, but at highway speeds, there's a point where it refuses to shift when it probably could, and you lose some passing power.  Gas mileage, even though I was gunning it, seems to be pretty poor.  I think I got less than 20 MPG.  But hey, the A/C is cold.

I couldn't wait to return this thing and retrieve my Accord from the body shop.  I'll stick with my imports, thank you.
