            When I bought this camera I was told by acquaintances that Casio was famous for great gadgets but not exactly for quality and durability.

Well, the Casio QV-3500 has been a great camera to use: beautiful picture quality, ease of use, logical menus, etc. The IBM 3340 MB Microdrive is a must, to go with the camera. With the ability to store 245 high-res pictures in the memory, digital photography really becomes what it should be: freedom to shoot as many pics as you want. The NiMH-batteries are great too: cheap, and you can have two extra 4-battery sets in your pocket for unlimited photography the whole day long, then charge them at night.

Unfortunately my QV-3500 has also needed repair TWICE in the first six months I've had it. First the flash malfunctioned, then the CCD. Both repairs were done under the warranty, but it was still very annoying, and now that my one-year warranty is running out I'm getting nervous of further failures. From other users I have heard that the build quality certainly leaves something to be desired. When my camera was repaired I had a chance to look inside the box, and there were quite a few signs of sloppy workmanship, such as wires soldered over faulty printboards to bypass troublespots...

I guess my conclusion is that the camera is great when it works, but that there really is a reason why it is cheaper than  similar offers from other manufacturers. If you decide to buy it, I hope you will have a camera without quality problems, but you have been warned.
