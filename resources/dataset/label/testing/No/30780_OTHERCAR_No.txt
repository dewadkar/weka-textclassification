            The main problem with this camera is that it eats batteries like crazy, so any money you save on film and processing you spend on AA batteries.  So much for saving the environment from the processing chemicals. However, I just got some Olympus rechargable battaries for 30 bucks, so it takes care of that.

The software that comes with it is a mixed bag.  The Camedia program is pretty good. It's basically a contact sheet viewer/download app.  The Adobe Photo Deluxe is a joke. Although it is based on Photoshop, it's buggy and slow.

Other than that, the plastic door that covers the input/ac jacks is very flimsy and will probably break off.  That's a problem.  I don't see why they just didn't make the jack similar to video cameras, where you have a rubber insert that protects the jacks.  The camera is very easy to use and is light weight.  It has a very good flash and can do red eye etc.  Probably one of the more interesting features is the rear panel viewer, which allows you to edit/ view the pictures, and also serves a a view finder.  Again, it eats a lot of power to use it, but pretty cool anyway.

It also comes with a smart media card, so you can remove it and keep shooting.  This comes in hand when you are on a long vacation and don't have a chance to download your pictures to your pc.    

It takes great pictures at a variety of resolutions and can shoot 100+ pictures in a &quot;roll.&quot;  

If you are not taking a lot of pictures in a row, or will be using the AC adapter/ rechargeable batteries then this is the camera for you.<br><br>
