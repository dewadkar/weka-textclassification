            I was in the market for a new car about a month ago. For the past three years I had been driving a 1991 CRX which I absolutely loved, but had accumulated 150,000 miles and was ready to be put out to pasture. Unfortunately, Honda stopped making the CRX a while back (and WHY? It is such an awesome little car) so I went for what seemed to be the closest brand-new equivalent: the 2000 Civic Hatchback CX.

I was lucky, the dealer had ONE car on the entire lot that fit my needs (silver hatchback with a 5-speed) but it was not ready to be test-driven yet so I put up a $50 dollar 'security' deposit in case someone were to try and sneak in and snatch the car from under my nose the next day. 

When I got to drive it I had only one complaint, and a minor one: the car has no tachometer. A tachometer is not available on DX and CX Civic models. Amazing. One thing Honda does NOT do is give you a bargain in the equipment department, but that is one of those things you just -accept- because Hondas are arguably the best cars on the road. All that didn't bother me too much anyway because I have never had a car that was 'loaded' in any respect. I proceeded to the financing part of the deal. And the fur began to fly.

To begin, the dealer saw that I am young and assumed that I was a moron with no inkling of how to handle myself in the finance office, and I expected this; I know that it is basically the job of the finance manager to try and take you for as much money as he can. I do not, however,  appreciate being flat-out lied to. Here is the math, you decide if it makes sense:

Total Price of car, TTL and all was $16,153
Equity on my car was $142 which leaves us with $16,011
My down Payment was $2000 dollars, leaving me with a $14,011 loan amount.
I was approved for a 60 month note at 10.25% interest, not simple interest but a per-diem (which I'm not sure I understand) loan through none other than American Honda Finance.
Somehow, my payments were going to be $423 per month. Ummm hello?...on a 60 month note...for the cheapest car that Honda sells, that doesn't even have a tachometer...$423 a month?! The finance manager seemed to think this was an excellent deal.

I wasn't all that thrilled about it, and told mister finance manager that if he came up with a payment near $300 a month (give or take $20) I'd drive off with the car that day. He then proceeded to show me my credit report, and with a red pen circled the 'problem areas' of my credit (one 30 day late payment and the fact that I have $800 dollars in outstanding balances) and tried to tell me that I have bad credit and this is why the payments were so high. Now, I know I have very good credit. I have three credit cards, over $30,000 in available credit, one late payment in my entire lifetime and otherwise excellent payment history (I usually pay my entire balance at the end of the month) and have paid off two cars previously. Buying a tiny Honda (without even a tachometer) shouldn't be a problem for me.

After about three hours of this (finally got the payment down to $342) I gave up. I was tired, Carmax was across the street (I bought two previous cars there) and the finance man was at this point a complete idiot. I told the man I'd have to 'give it another day' and requested my deposit back. Things got ugly, then...the finance manager stated to me that the deposit that I put on the car was only refunded towards the purchase of a new car, and that I could not get it back. Needless to say, I was livid. I ended up talking to the general manager of the dealership and not only got my deposit back but filled out a *nasty* comment card and 5 free oil changes from that Honda dealership which I'm not even sure if I am going to use.

My advice: if you want to buy a new Honda, find the car you want, get the total price for it, go to your bank or credit union get financed on your own... if you have good credit and don't normally have a problem getting approved for loans this will save you a multitude of hassle, and most likely you'll get a better interest rate as well. The slight inconvenience of loan-hunting on your own is well worth the benefits. 

I would have bought the car had it not been for the outright hideous treatment that I experienced at the dealer...be warned! Honda dealers know that the cars practically sell themselves, and that most people who want a Honda are willing to pay more (ie: get shafted) if they really want it. You just might be better off going to Carmax (which has the best customer service ANYWHERE) if there is one in your area and finding yourself a nice used Honda. <br><br>
