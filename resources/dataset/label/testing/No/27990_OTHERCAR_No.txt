            In Oct. of 2002 I decided that I wanted a 1999 Audi A6 Quattro.  I purchased a gorgeous off lease 99 with 58K on the odo.

We then proceeded to have the worst winter ever and the quattro system was awesome, MUCH better then my 4wd Pathfinder.

So why is it the WORST car I have ever owned?  Well these cars have more electrical problems then you could imagine!

First the battery went, no big deal so I replaced it.  

Then the blinker started to "blink" at light speed when the left blinker was turned on and blinked like a snail when the right one was on.  Well the left bulb was burnt out, so I THOUGHT.  Well it wasn't the bulb it was the little plastic bulb housing that shorted out because those BRILLIANT Audi engineers used ALUMINUM connectors!!!!  Everyone else in the world knows not to use aluminum electrical connectors anymore.  So I replaced the plastic housing and it was fixed.

Then the window wouldn't work correctly.  The auto up feature is AWESOME until it goes 2/3rds of the way up and kicks down.  That was a lot of fun in the rain.

Then my heated steering wheel CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!!  Yes FIRE!  IT shorted out and burnt through the wheel.  Since the heated wheel is connected to the heated seats I couldn't use the heated seats because of the shorted out wheel.

Then I had black material blown all over my dash from the A/C motor and the blower motor vibrated violently.  I took it in and Audi said it was the Cam tensioner gaskets, water pump, timing chain etc. etc. and they wanted $1,750 to fix it!

I wondered why $40K Audis were selling for $15-$20K after 3 years, this is why.

All of these things happened in 6 months!  I didn't have the $1,750 worth of work done I promptly drove to BMW and bought a new 3 series and couldn't be happier.

I would also like to add I have two other friends with A6s, one 2002 3.0 and one 2003 2.7t.

The 2002 has already had all 4 rotors replaced at 6K miles and the 2003 has been replaced under the lemon law after being in the shop 4 times and 2 months with 2.2K on the odo.

Don't believe me?  Pick up a copy of Consumer reports.

I will NEVER by another VW or Audi product.
