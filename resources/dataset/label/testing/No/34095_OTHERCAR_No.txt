            This camera has been a huge disappointment. It looked well constructed and seemed to take good detailed pictures. I paid 400.00 for it at RadioShack (supposedly on sale??)Buy this camera if you need to throw your money away. 

After using it 3-4 times, it quit working. I tried replacement batteries, playing with the doors, the card, whatever, it was just simply broken. I had been very careful with this camera and followed all instructions and warnings. It was all for nothing. It put me in a very bad position because I need a digital camera for work on ebay. IT QUIT WORKING OVER THREE MONTHS AGO, AND AN ACCEPTABLE REPLACEMENT HAS STILL NOT ARRIVED.

I contacted RadioShack, and they would not help or stand behind me regarding this defective merchandise. Keep this in mind if you plan to make any major purchases from RadioShack. They would not contact the company. They offered no help whatsoever. Forget about getting a refund.

I had to call Thompson Multimedia Inc at least 10 times long distance. Their ploy is to leave you on hold, long distance until you finally hang up. They had an excuse for everything. Although this camera bears the logo Of RCA, it is made by Thomson. I asked them several times if they had similar problems with this model. They denied any such problems, saying that it was a good camera (HA!) Just read the reviews!


Finally they agreed to send a replacement camera. It arrived after 12-15 days. The replacement had a remodeled sticker on the back, it had what appeared to be acid splotches all over the back, and an "R" clearly melted into the back. It looked like trash. Judging by the appearance, I tried it out before accepting it. The replacement didn't work either. In addition, it was shipped to me without any packing materials. It was simply tossed into the box, and shipped. The replacement was returned, still keeping the original. (Neither of them worked, but at least mine looked better)

THOMSON THEN CLAIMED THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE THE REPLACEMENT CAMERA, (WHICH WAS BROKEN ANYWAY) AND THAT THEY WOULD BE CHARGING MY BANK ACCOUNT AN ADDITIONAL 400.00 FROM MY DEBIT CARD. (I GAVE THEM THE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY DEMANDED ONE TO PAY FOR THE INITIAL SHIPPING FEE OF 20.00)

I have since called them at least 15 more times. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who agreed to send another replacement. First, I was told that I could only have a used, remodeled camera. Then I was told that they would send a 'nice one'. It has been 15 days and I am still waiting for another replacement. It is scary to imagine what they may send next.

DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. THEY ARE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND UNRELIABLE. THEY ARE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU BUY RCA. I have contacted the better business bureau in this matter.
