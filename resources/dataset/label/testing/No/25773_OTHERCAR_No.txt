            This car, has been a financial nightmare. My parents bought a 1993 Nissan Altima SE (Sports edition), brand new. This car was the answer to all of our prayers,...at first. With three growing kids, and a lot of soccer games, and tennis matches to attend, this car was a dream. My dad had been trying to talk my mom into the more maturnal Bonneville, but my sporty mother would have none of it! Our Altima was black, and automatic with all the bells and whistles including power windows, door locks, sunroof, tilt, cruise, control, etc. This car ran like a dream..
until what I scathingly refer to as D-Day. 

At right about 80,000 miles, after a perfect track record, things just started to break. We hit 80,000 miles pretty quick, probably after about 4 years. First, the sunroof broke, and soaked the entire car every time it rained. $1,500 later, it was fixed. Two weeks later, the lock on the passenger door would no longer unlock with the key from the outside. Two weeks after that, the window would no longer go down.

Now, it's nearly 2001, and my mother still owns this jalopy. It now sports, a rebuilt engine, its third sunroof, the passenger door lock is now broken again, and it growls like a constipated bear every time you press the gas pedal. Her CD player has now stopped working, and it sounds like anything you try to play, features the singer gargling with about 4 oz. of Scope while attempting to sing. Her transmission is sticky, and her headlights have recently started a very interesting flicker, that leads people to think you're flashing your brights at them. All in all, not wonderful.

In my opinion, Nissan's are a *dream* until 80,000 miles. Then, I wouldn't wish one on an enemy.<br><br>
