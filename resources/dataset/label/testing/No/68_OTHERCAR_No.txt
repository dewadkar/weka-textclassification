            My brother leased the sport version of the E430. It has all the bells and whistles. But for a 58k car we had to pay extra for the CD player. The car is solid with great handling with the sport suspension even though its a big car. In addition, there is pleanty of power from the V8, but gas mileage is horrible. The interior is bland nothing to write home about. The malfunction light keeps coming on for stupid thing. The day I picked up the car one of the headlights wasnt working, and the climate control isnt very accurate, might as well have it off, and pump the air manually. Ive gone through 2 sets of tires Im on my third now and we have the car for 18 months. The potholes and the 17in rims cause the tires to bubble and throws the alingmnet off, so my tires began wearing unevenly. We live in New York where the winters are snowy and the car is useless in snow, I cant even pull into my driveway with the rear wheel drive and Z rated tires. The traction control is worthless, it doesnt prevent the car from fishtailing.
For the price of the car you can get 2 30,000 cars and be just as happy, unless you like turning heads with the benz. The car is not worth the price.
