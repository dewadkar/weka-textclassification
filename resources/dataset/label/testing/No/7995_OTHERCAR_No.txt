            I bought my car from a wholesaler in August of 2002.  As of now, only over a year later, the car is basically dead.  

I was seeking a luxurious SUV that would be unique and that had 4x4 capabilities.  I did get all of those attributes in this car.  

The mentioning of "Range Rover" alone evokes a sense of luxury and for good reason.  It is decked with electrically adjustable leather seating with 2 memory controls, heated seats, leather steering wheel, heated windshield, a/s/d sound system complete with amplifier, 8" subwoofer, and two surface mounted tweeters, a huge back seat in the LWB edition, electric windows with a childrens lock and a "one touch" feature in the front, a gigantic electric moonroof with cover that is the biggest I've ever seen, and many other amenities.  The cabin is very spacious and provides a broad, clear view of the road and surroundings.  Unlike other SUVs, the back seat is large and allows 2-3 passengers to sit comfortably with ample leg room even with front seats in fully reclined position.  In fact, some of my friends preferred sitting in the back.  The only problems I encountered with the interior was a completely collapsed headliner, heated seats that didnt work, and faulty electric mirror controls.  The only addition I would make would be cupholders which are nonexistent.  The car would be a dream if you didn't actually have to drive anywhere and could relax to some music in the comfy cabin.  

Before I delve into the myriad of downfalls with the car I might add that beside the cabin, the 4x4 capabilities of the car I believe are unmatched and the ride with air shocks is very smooth.  I enjoyed a smooth ride on and off road.
Unfortunately the rest of the car is a far different story.  The previous owner of my car had a lease for about 95,000 miles.  All maintenance was performed by the dealership at scheduled times.  I had the car looked at by a mechanic before purchasing who did a thorough check including engine performance and diagnostics.  It had a few minor problems--tires had low tread, steering damper needed changing, and a couple of cosmetic bang ups--nothing major, and the engine checked out fine and the mechanic added "it ran strong".  So I bought it for $6900, $7400 with tax.  Within six months my rear differential broke, my steering column went to hell, and several other bugs appeared.  Dealership price quotes were ridiculous so I was recommended to a local mechanic who worked on foreign cars.  The first bill came to around $1500.  Not two months later I had recurring problems with steering that were supposed to have been fixed.  My tires had been worn bald as well and right as I went to get it worked on again, my air shocks blew.  Coil spring conversion was the only logical thing to do unless I wanted to spend $4000 on new air shocks.  $1500 on a new suspension.  Only a couple models to choose from on tires too which run around $180 a piece.  Got the work done from a different mechanic this time as it seemed the first mechanic did not fix my car correctly.  As soon as I got my car back the steering fluid started leaking.  Then the CV joint blew.  Then my engine would, unprovoked, lose all power and drop to 1000 RPMs repeatedly and for no apparent reason.  The repair for the CV joint costs $1500 and the steering pump and line costs $1000.  The engine is another story in itself.  It is no longer drivable and I was advised to sell the car for what I could get for it, the only likely buyers would be mechanics or those who would sell the car for parts.  I could get an estimated $2000 for it if I'm lucky.  All in all, I will lose about $8000-9000.  Lots of money down the crapper is the story in a nutshell.

A note on Land Rover as a company.  My mechanic went to Land Rover school and informed them on a way to prevent the steering fluid leakage and pump damage.  Land Rover saves money buy using transmission fluid which is cheaper instead of steering fluid.  Transmission fluid serves as a lesser grade lubricant for the steering system and in turn seeps through gaskets and damages pumps.  It cost me $1000.  My mechanic suggested flushing the transmission fluid out and using a high grade steering fluid as to alleviate this expensive problem.  Land Rover declined his suggestion and told my mechanic how much money their dealerships were making by replacing the parts that the transmission fluid damaged.  Those greedy bastards, as if they weren't making enough selling SUVs for $80,00+, they have to screw people over like that to scam more cash out of them.  I have heard bad things about Land Rover dealerships' mechanical integrity as well.  Not to mention everything is outrageously priced there.  Land Rover sucks.  I hate them with a passion.
