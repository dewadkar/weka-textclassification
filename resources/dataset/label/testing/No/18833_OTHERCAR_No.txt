            Upon searching for a Digital Camera with numerous features, I came across the PV-SD4090. I found the camera a bit cumbersome to handle but feature packed. I like the idea of using a media such as a SuperDisk but as far as the finished photo is concerned, I find the color depth quite weak and washed out in both manual record and regular record. I also found the flash to be minimal in nightime picture taking. The photos taken in and out in various light conditions appear grainy and washed out. If you use the Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0 that comes in the package, you can alter the image to a more natural state but for the price, you should not have to. I commend Panasonic on their media choice and for the accessories included but, I would like a camera that takes natural and richly colored photographs.<br><br>
