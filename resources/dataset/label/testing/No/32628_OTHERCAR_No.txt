            I purchased a 1995 Sunfire and had problems from the moment I drove it off the lot.  The radio didn't work!  Shortly thereafter, the car began to stop (shut off) in traffic without explanation.  The car would sputter, then die.  

For 8 MONTHS I took the car back to the dealership, and each time, they told me that &quot;The Machine&quot; says that there's nothing wrong.  Finally, after many threats and eventually, the promise of imposing the &quot;Lemon Law&quot;, they took back my car (at $2000 for mileage) and gave me a new car (with $1200 as a down payment).

Now, I've had a 1997 Sunfire for 3 years and the same thing is happening!  I thought it was just bad gasoline, but it kept dying on me.  I had it towed to the dealership and they told me that &quot;The Machine&quot; said it had a bad fuel pump.  That pump cost me $700 (with labor)!

The very next day, following the repair, THE CAR DIED ON ME AT WORK!  I'm sure you can imagine the creative words that I used to express my anger.
I called the dealership to express my dissatisfaction and was told, &quot;We don't know what to tell you.  It must be something else.&quot;  Once again, I had it towed back to the dealership to be looked at.  They kept it for a full day and told me to come get it because &quot;The Machine&quot; said everything is fine.

Fast forward 1 day...

It's Saturday night and I'm leaving the video store.  As I turn the key, the car sputters, but has some power.  When I pull out into SATURDAY NIGHT TRAFFIC, the car sputters, and has no power when I hit gas pedal.  It died in the middle of traffic!  I had to push it more than one block to get it out of the way.  Luckily, there was a nice guy who ran out to help me.  Now, I have to use MORE of my leave time from work to take my car back to the dealership and have &quot;The Machine&quot; diagnose it again.  Add to that the cost of my THIRD vehicle rental in 7 DAYS from the dealership: $30 each time!  

What the heck am I supposed to do about this?  Has anyone else experienced these problems?  Please write me at hskrfans@aol.com.

NEVER...EVER....EVER.... buy a 1995 or 1997 Pontiac Sunfire!<br><br>
