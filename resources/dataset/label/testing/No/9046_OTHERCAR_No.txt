            My husband and myself really wanted to purchase the Toyota Rav4.  However, the price of the desired vehicle was not in our range.  We did not get the chance to buy our dream SUV, but we did test drive it and go through the walkthrough.
We have been wanting an SUV for sometime now, due to the fact that we love road trips, and have several dogs that adore the outdoors and travelling as well.  We were about to go home crestfallen for lack of funding when we saw the KIA dealership.  We didn't know much about KIA other than that they had competitive prices and were reasonable.
We test drove the vehicle, the price was right, and the salesman was actually very straight-forward.
We were informed that the problems of the earlier sportages were fixed in the 2000 models, and that they hadn't had any real problems or complaints so far.  We signed our souls away and bought the car, very pleased with ourselves.
The KIA Sportage does handle very nicely, and offers what I believe to be the better ride among the SUVS, as well as having one of the better looking frames.
We drove the KIA from New Orleans, LA to San Fransisco, CA at an unbearable pace of 15-17 hours a day, and I also have to ascertain that the sportage is quite the trooper for endurance hauls.
However, halfway through the mountains of Texas, we got to know our vehicle really well, and this is why I advise you to do the research before you purchase:  Not only did the sportage decide to stall a few times on the incline, but the RPMS ranged well above what I feel comfortable with as a woman driving in the middle of nowhere at 3 in the morning.  The vehicle would not handle the climbs well at all.  Descending the ranges were just as bad, for the transmission would lag and then over excellerate to keep up often causing the exhaust pipe to backfire, which frightened me for no reason.
We made the journey safetely, but now our transmission needs replaced.  We have not had these problems before with any other vehicle of any other make or model, so we know that it is purely our car and not driver error.  
Another problem we have found with the KIA is the gas mileage.  It seems like you retank at least 3 times a week, and that to me is outrageous!
All and all I like my vehicle, I think that it is good competition for the market, but I think that KIA needs to fix a few of the kinks in the make before I purchase another sportage.<br><br>
