             I purchased my 1996 Dodge Neon in 1997. This was the car I wanted. Well, this became a nightmare. In less than a year after purchase, I had problems. The oil leaks and I just found out I need a headgasket. Now this would not be a problem for me except I have found out that the headgaskets on these models are faulty. Why should I have to pay for Chryslers mistake! To add to the fire, my radio and power windows will not function somethimes for weeks at a time and when you think they will never work again the radio will come back on and the windows will work. I have over 100,000 miles on this vehicle so when the mechanic told me I needed a transmission I was not surprised and can deal with that. The cost is actually cheaper than the head gasket repair. I truely wish I would have investigated this particular vehicle more before purchasing. Last but not least the braking system is horrible. After changing the brake pads and shoes , I find out this vehicle is also known for having sqeaking brakes. The car is paid for so I just try and live with it.
