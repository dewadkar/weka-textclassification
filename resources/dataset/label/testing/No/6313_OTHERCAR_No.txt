            I was looking for a car and the year was 1996.  I was down at an Auto Auction in Florida and a green 1996 Dodge Avenger caught my eye.  I should have seen it was the devil.  I bought the car for 11,00 at auction and the battery was dead when I went to pick it up.  I should have left it there.  
      The car is a coupe, and looks real mean and sporty.  Yet with the 4 cylinder engine and the large frame, it handles like a milk truck.  Dodge moved the wheels out to make the cars more stable.  All this does is turn a 3-point turn into something resembling a pentagram.  It had very little pep and it's pickup was troubling.  I'm 6'4&quot; and the car did fit me fine in the front seat.  God forbid you sat in the back.  
      As for service, this was really my main problem with the car.  It seemed that everything went wrong. From the battery to the alternator, to the rear window leaking.  Finally, the camshaft went and I got fed up.  But as for the night I decided to junk the car....it went something like this.  I was sitting in the bar with some friends when I saw this lady waving.  She looked familiar but I really couldn't place her. As she waved me over, calling my name, I realized it was Karen from Dutchess Dodge.  One of the ladies in service that you talk to about problems with the car.  She was telling her friends about what a nice guy I am and how I was always talking to her.  I don't know about you, but I never want to be recognized by any Service Advisors, they are people you never hope to see.  
      So, the next day I went to look at pickup trucks.  Bought a 98 GMC Sierra the next week and traded in the Avenger, thank God.  Please do not buy this car.  It was a lemon in a sportcar's clothing.
