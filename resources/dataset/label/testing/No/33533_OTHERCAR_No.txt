            I drive a silver 2001 Beetle. Each time I walk to the car, I feel partly vindicated in my decision to buy it - even at a price that would fetch a more substantial auto. It looks simply stunning, and friends are always commenting on that.

The inside aesthetics are as good as the external ones. I tend to get bored with the steering wheels of cars I own (is there anyone else like me out there?) - this one looks fresh time after time. The dashboard too is elegant and unusual. The only drawback to the view are the wide A pillars, but one quickly gets used to them.

Still, I am overall quite displeased with the car, and that is due to ride quality. I have read a few positive reviews of the New Beetle's suspension, but while the car handles very well, the ride quality is very poor. I live in Portland, OR, and drive the car to work each day on Highway 217 which has a somewhat uneven surface. And I feel that each and every small bump on that surface is transmitted to me - several hundred every second. Some friends ascribe this to the German "feel the road" philosophy, but the Passat is much smoother. Since money was not the reason I chose the Beetle over the Passat, this is a major grouse with me.

The road noise is also quite high, especially on rough roads. Shielding from external noise is also insufficient. At times, you can hardly hear the radio over the noise.

I was also surprised by the poor manufacturing quality. This is the first German car I have owned, and so my expectations were high. No! The hand brake button tended to chatter right from the first day. Though I have no other major noises, a few squeaks do emanate from under the dashboard on rough roads. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that this car is not assembled in Germany, unlike the Passat.

And of course, space and the lack of 4 doors is a bit of a constraint, but I knew that at the time of putting down the money.

I wish there was a larger Japanese car of the Accord or Camry variety that was this visually stimulating. I don't think one should have to pay such a high price in ride comfort for visual aesthetics.
