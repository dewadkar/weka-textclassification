            I was looking for an inexpensive car that had a low price and the Hyundai Excel met the standard.  However after I bought the car and the manufacture's warranty had expired the trouble started.  The transmission went on it three times with an average cost of $2,000.00 every time that it was repaired.  I would not recommend this model of car or the Hyundai Brand because of the problems I had and the expense that was incurred because of the vehicle.<br><br>
