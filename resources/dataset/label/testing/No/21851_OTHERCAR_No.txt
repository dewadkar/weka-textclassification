            While SUV shopping with my sister, I begrudgingly stopped at our somewhat local GM dealership.  While single, childless, and urban, my sibling insisted that an SUV was the only car that could meet her needs.  After test-driving an Envoy, an H2 that had been freshly washed caught her eye, and I knew what was coming next.  

     This is an enormous looking vehicle; with flared fenders and bold accents it is rather intimidating to those of us with mid-sized cars.  After opening up the door I was less than impressed, perhaps because I was looking for something of quality in the $50,000 dollar range.  On closer inspection it seemed they had ripped the steering wheel and interior materials out of a Suburban and a Trailblazer, then added metal veneer accents.  The overall interior treatment seemed cheap.  The Emperor has no clothes!  

     Knowing that most SUV drivers will never go off road, many makers have softened the suspension accordingly, not GM, the Hummer has a nervous and jittery ride.  The seats while large, were not very supportive and had the typical (and annoying) GM shoulder mounted seatbelts to boot.

     On the way back to the dealership, my sister asked if I would drive it to see what I thought.  So I climbed in and strapped myself to the seat, as I went to accelerate, I found that the H2 lacked power.  Given it's massive curb weight, and the fact that it's an SUV, I didn't expect it to be a rocket ship, but it was rather lethargic at best.  Even worse, I found that after our twenty-four hour test drive, we averaged eleven miles per gallon!

     I expected the H2's steering and handling to be loose, rough, and unresponsive; however, they have done a good job about controlling body motions.  The brakes were average; I didn't try to simulate a panic stop because I was afraid of how the two tons of steel behind me would behave without stability control.

     Looking at this Hummer in a parking lot, you would be sure you could fit whatever you needed to inside.  For most of us this may be true, but the cargo area itself it relatively unimpressive, there is about the same cargo room in many of the H2's somewhat smaller competitors.  Worse yet, there seems to be a lack of storage bins, and the interior layout could be better.

    After doing some research at Edmunds.com, I found that the H2 is also unreliable.  It ranked dead LAST on J.D. Power & Associate's quality survey averaging 225 complaints per 100 H2s.

     After returning to the dealership, I asked myself what about this product deserves fifty large?  A Suburban's sticker price on the dealer's lot was asking a lot less, yet would probably get the job done better.  The Hummer, I found, was not good in any category.  It did absolutely nothing well.  After talking to a few H2 owners, it seemed that they really couldn't say what the Hummer did well either; they mainly spoke of it's looks.  This leads me to believe that a Hummer owner is A.)  Seeking Attention & Status or B.) Seeking a tax break, since it qualifies as one for business owners.  
     
     After our experience with the Hummer, we both went away unimpressed and now laugh at H2 drivers.  By the way, my sister later test drove and purchased a new 4Runner, a terrific SUV.
