            A Dodge Daytona - my first drivable car. How could I be any happier? Easily! Pack me in a barrel and send me tumbling down Niagra Falls. Within 2 months of having the car, it started falling apart from the outside in. I live in Florida. Most would think charming weather, or "paradise" if you will. Not so! The weather started damaging my car within a month. Nothing major - chipped paint here and there but it does not only look unpleasant but it causes the value of the car to plunge. 
<i>A Hit in the Head</i>
I ventured up to Georgia for a week long vacation. The car ran just beautifully until I went to come back to the place I call home. The gears weren't shifting correctly and eventually it went down to 2, never to come back up again... first gear... an occasional backfire. To say the least, this displeased me. =c) I ended up having to spend an extra 3 days in Georgia while my transmission was rebuilt. Luckily for me, during this time my warranty was still in effect but last time I checked, the warranty doesn't cover the cost of hotel rooms and extra meals. *growls* About the only nice thing I can say about the trip was that I experienced some amazing sunsets up on Stone Mountain.
Skip ahead a few months: my radiator blew. Can we say, "D'oh?" Instead of paying mucho bucks for having a professional fix it, I decided I would take a swig at it. The results weren't good. I ended up busting the air conditioner. Refer to the top, Florida and no a/c. Value of the car in this condition? Negative 2 dollars. Granted, that was my own stupidity. I'll give the car that much but even the spark plugs were in an inconvieniant location. If I could only tell you in details how many tools and the such I had to borrow, I would. Too many! 
Over time, (as would be expected I suppose) all of the hoses decided to either blow off, blow up, or not blow at all. I had to replace all of them which were -surprise- also in a bad spot! The car would hesitate dramatically. It even got the point where I would stall upon taking off. Not a very healthy situation when you live in the city! "Putt-putt-putt..." and then it would die. 
My water pump was not going to be left out of the action. Right before I traded this mean and cruel beast in, it decided to go too. None of the stalling problems were solved, it still over-heated. It was still a piece of junk. In all honesty I don't believe they were smart in what the dealer offered me for the Daytona. I'm just glad it out of my hands and no longer <b>my</b> problem!
