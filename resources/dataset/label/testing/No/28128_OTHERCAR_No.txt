            I bought this camera a while ago since I wanted a small digital camera to take with me at all times. The Polaroid looked really nice and the price was right. Once I played around with it, though, I came to the conclusion that it had too many limitations and I returned the camera.

Here are the things I did not like:

Battery life: so bad I think Polaroid owns stock in the energizer bunny.

Picture Quality: OK for close shots (upto 5ft). For long shots, the pictures were fuzzy and not usable. THIS was the MAIN reason for returning it.

Bundled software: so-so. I used Photoshop to manipulate images, so no big deal.

Things I liked:

Looks: It's really a cool little camera, easy to take along. I also liked the upright shape.

Closeup Pictures: looked quite nice.
