            I've been a professional photographer for more than 20 years.
I've been interested in digital cameras for about 9 years when I first purchased an Apple Quicktake.Cute camera though the photos looked best on screen.It was a start
on my digital life though!

About 8 digicams later I moved up to the Nikon D100.I got one of the early batches with one phone call even though I was on a RITZ list for ages they didn't come thru as quick as just picking up the phone on a whim..

So,I've had this camera for at least 5 months now and use it in my work as a photographer.
I shoot alot of editorial and PR work so my lighting
and situations are always different.

Early on I realized my Nikon SB-28 flash would not give good results with this camera and I purchased the SB-80DX.
Soon after I realized my 3rd party lenses would be giving me error messages and would stop functioning when the D100 would not recognize that a lens was attached.
So,I bought all new Nikon lenses.Big ones,little ones,short ones,expensive ones!

I am not alone when I say that every photo taken inside,outside and with or without flash is underexposed and not very sharp.I've sat in the same position using every single setting that this camera has and it's not been remedied.I've also used ever Nikon AF lens I own from the 16mm fisheye to the 80-200 2.8 D.

Photoshop will fix everything up(I use PS 7 on a Mac)
but when I do a big job and come back with 1500
images,the last thing I want is a numb arm and blood shot eyes from being in front of the computer for 2 days
making adjustments.
I have spoken with many other pros that have this problem as well.Nikon denies a problem exists but will go on to say that it's careful not to blow out the highlights and whites.because if that happens,you have a completely unusable image.

I shoot in jpeg format since I have to shoot alot and shoot fast so I don't really need the Nikon 3 capture software that cost appx $150.00.
But,since I have to do color correction and saturation adjustments on most images,I have not found a
batch solution that is workable and repeatable.

I have shot a few RAW images and they looked good.I did not purchase the Nikon capture 3 software so after 30 days it expired.

The best digicam software is from the Kodak high end cameras.It amazes me that Nikon would charge for their software which isn't very good anyway.

I'm not sorry I bought the D100 as the pros are that the battery life is excellent and it fits well in my hand and
the weight is good.I borrowed a D1X and it was too heavy for all day jobs for me.


My next digicam will most likely be the Kodak 14N(or whatever). The big files appeal to me for BIG prints
and my stock photography needs big files as well.
I know Kodaks pro cameras have always been the best around and ditto for their software.

Unless of course Nikon improves on the D100!
