            I have a Sony Mavica FD83 that I have been very pleased with in terms of decent shots, decent color.  However, it is very bulky to take, and it ends up staying at home.  In addition, on a vacation, dealing with fifty floppies is daunting to say the least.  

So, I wanted a small take anywhere camera that I could take on vacation.  I settled on the Nikon Coolpix 885 because of Nikon's reputation and because of a few positive online reviews of the camera.  

The camera is well made and fairly easy to use.  What the problem is-and this is something that I could have known had I read reviews on the digital web sites-is that it had a MARKEDLY red coloration to pictures, especially indoors.  This was noticed not only by myself, an avid amateur photographer, but also by my wife and my mom both who are point and shooters.  It was so bad that I returned the camera for a loss, and had to sell, again at a big loss, the rechargeable battery and charger that I bought for it.  While we are on the subject, I think it is horrible marketing to sell the camera without the recharger and rechargeable battery.   This is a 120 dollar 'hidden cost', because no one in their right mind is going to buy expensive throwaway batteries for their camera.  

Nikon's customer service was about as unconcerned as they could be.  In spite of many user comments and complaints about this problem, they denied it completely.  The technical person said that he thought this problem MIGHT be fixed in the next firmware upgrade, but had no information, since those technicians are in Japan and don't communicate what they are working on to the US technical staff.  

As a result of this, I will never ever purchase a Nikon product again.  I went out and did some more research, and ended up with a Canon Powershot S110, which cost 330 dollars.  I could not be happier with this tiny gem of a camera, and i take it everywhere.
