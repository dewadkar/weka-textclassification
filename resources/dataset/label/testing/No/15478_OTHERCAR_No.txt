            I purchased this camera because I wasn't happy with the digital camera that I had, and wanted one that was easy to download onto the computer.
The Mavica was the perfect choice for me as I could take close up shots ,
edit if I didn't care for it , and the pictures came out great. I could pop out the floppy and pop it into my computer and send photo's to my family &amp; friends instantly.
It has also come in quite handy for other reasons , such as my daughters school projects . She needed a photo of something unusual for the next day and low and behold we happen to experience a rainbow the night before!
I quickly snapped a few photos and went in to print them . They came out beautifully clear.
It is a very easy camera to master. All you have to do is carry some extra floppy discs with you .
This product is great for new parents , that take loads of baby pictures.
You can view the pictures instantly ,edit them,email them  and print them or just store them on a floppy disc for a later date .<br><br>
