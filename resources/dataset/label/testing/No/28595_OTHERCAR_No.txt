            I have a friend who purchased a customised Jeep Wrangler and has had nothing but bad luck with it.  When he left the dealership he was told that his warrenty would still be supported if he was to use a lift kit and install bigger tires on his Jeep.  Well it appears that he bought the lemon out of the batch cause he has to make regular trips to the dealership to have parts replace just about every week now and it has been getting out of hand.  
      Now the dealership has grown tired of replacing these parts and have decided to go back on their word and say that his warrenty is now voided cause of his lift job.  Now hes stuck with an extended warrenty thats worthless and a jeep with a dead shaft box.  Dang thing nearly killed him when he was going 70 down the interstate and the axle just came out and started bouncing around on the asphalt and ripping all the guts out from the bottom of the jeep.  He managed to swerve to the median before it came to a screatching stop.
    Hes had to have the following replaced: (( and possibly more))  Oil pan need resealing, the gear box, bearings in three of the tires, had to have the transmission resealed, water pump just split open and poored out water on the interstate, unexplainable noises.
     He's finally been told from one of the represenitives that jeeps don't like the interstate.  Theres something about going at high speeds thats hard on them.  Which has to be true cause he did do alot of interstate travel as well as some slight mudding,  nothing major though.  I&quot;m afraid that if hes gonna get his money back for his trouble that hes gonna have to sue them just to get their attention cause they sure enough are not gonna help him as is with this broken piece of matter!
     Has anyone else out there had this sort of problems with your jeep?  if so then please post a responce, I want to see what you have to say.  Never know you might have the cure to his problems.  
     <b>Oh</b>, they wouldn't even make a deal where they would get him another jeep and swap with him either.  So sad that buisnesses out there are this greedy.<br><br>
