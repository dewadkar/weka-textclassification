            I really wanted to like the Deville DTS.  I've been waiting and waiting for GM to get its act together and produce a top notch luxury car.  So with my father in the market, I made him test drive this one.

Why not a Seville STS?  I wanted to get GM's latest generation suspension.  With the DTS they've supposedly added a few more tweaks to the electronics to cure the inherent front-wheel-drive nasties.  

Also, while I would have never considered a DeVille before, even for my old man, this one looks sharp.  The old DeVille looked really old, even when it was first introduced.  Especially when it was first introduced, because then it had half-covered rear wheels.  GM later opened the wheel wells up, but the overall styling of the car remained very dated.  Not a car I would even want to put your old man in.

The press has not been charitable about the new DeVille's looks, saying it should have a more distinctive, somehow more American appearance.  I'm not sure what they mean by this.  Do they want it to look more like the old one, which screamed geezermobile?  Probably not.  Or more like the Evoq show car?  More likely.  They'll have to wait for the next one in that case.

At any rate, I disagree. I think Cadillac's designers have done a very good job here.  It�s instantly recognizable as a Cadillac.  I can't see that anyone will think it's anything else.  It's also clearly an American car.  Yet it avoids the cliches that were piled on the previous DeVille.  It looks like a large Cadillac, yet it also looks up to date.

The vertically stacked headlamps are easily the most questionable part of the exterior.  They look similar to some Mercedes lamps.  I think I'm warming to them, but can see how some may never like them.  In contrast, the rear lamps are unquestionably very nicely done.  They have an interesting yet tasteful shape to them.  Though thicker than the old Deville's lamps, they are still vertical, and lend an impression of strength to the rear end.

The sides are the main object of criticism.  At first I detected some Q45 here.  I've never liked the current Q.  Something in it reminds me of early 80s Buick.  But unlike with the Q, the more I've seen the new DeVille the more I've liked it.  The proportions are somehow better.  The impression from the sides is one of solidity, like with the Q, but also of agility.  The difference might be the height and shape of the fenders.  The Q gets a little dated over the wheels.  In this area the DeVille is cleaner and stronger.  The large 17&quot; wheels no doubt help here, though the 16s on the base car also pass muster.  Whatever the reason, this design looks more up to date, more aggressive, and less frumpy than the Q.

The bodyside proportions and wheels have another effect.  This is a very large car, yet only looks like, well, a large car.  Let�s just say it looks quite a bit tidier than it is.  In comparison, the Seville now looks bland.

The interior is also very well done.  The center of the dash is sloped away from you, nicely presenting the controls located there to your eye and hand.  The basic theme is strangely similar to that in the current Honda Accord.  I say &quot;strangely&quot; because the people who designed this interior could not have seen the Accord's at the time they did so given standard lead times.  The wood trim on the doors curves subtly into the oversized chrome door handles.  These handles are nice both to look at and operate.  The seats are large and comfy.  Four-way lumbar is a plus.  The rear seat is huge.  Suddenly a Seville seems overly confining, especially in the rear.  Interior storage is generous, and you could live in the trunk.

So far GM has done very well.  Then I drove the car.  Unfortunately, the performance does not deliver on the promise of the exterior.  The much-praised Northstar actually felt weak, like something was constraining it, until it got past 4000 rpm or so.  Are the electronics saving the tranny?  Was there a problem with the engine I drove?  I don�t know.  All I know is I�d floor it, and nothing much would happen till the engine dragged itself past 4000.  I watched a few times as the tach needle seemed to crawl through the mid-range.  Then, once past 4000, the engine would erupt into a roar and the car would surge ahead.  GM passed on variable valve timing, and I think variable intakes as well, with this engine to keep the cost down.  They need to reconsider.  These enhancements would boost low-end torque and, more importantly, even out the feel of this engine.

The roar of the engine is itself objectionable.  It sounds very traditional American V8 to me, not burbly but loud and relatively low in tone.  This sound would do well in a Camaro or Corvette, but is out of character in a luxury car.  It sounds crude.  Especially since the noise seems out of proportion to the thrust provided.  You don�t really feel connected to this engine like you do to that in a Lexus.  It�s not like you�re directly controlling the engine.  Instead, you push a pedal, and some time later something happens up there under the hood, and not entirely what you intended to happen.

Other problems follow from the front-wheel-drive layout.  Don�t hit the throttle with the wheel turned.  You�ll get massive torque steer.  The engine will attempt to steer the car.  This is totally unbecoming in a luxury car.  Through turns the car never feels all of a piece.  You can feel components up front bobbling this way and that�probably the engine cradle and powertrain moving on their bushings.  Not a pleasant feeling.  Not reassuring.  While this car will actually stick when pushed, it doesn�t enjoy fast turns.  

Nor will you.  Aside from the sensations just described, there are also problems inside the car.  The seat is totally bereft of lateral support, so you�ll have to brace yourself with a forearm on the door panel.  When you do this, the door panel trim compresses a bit and creaks.  Every time.  Not a quality sensation.  Ditto the tilt and telescope wheel.  It wasn�t working.  The wheel wasn�t quite where I would like it, increasing my reliance on the door panel for support.  In these situations, you feel like you�re being tossed about inside the car rather than functioning as part of it.

On a plus note, the steering lacks the traditional Cadillac numbness.  The steering effort is where I like it.  Also, the car never feels nearly as large as it is.  GM has eliminated any barge-like sensations.  The car usually rides smoothly and steadily, though not as fluidly as a Lexus.  Over most surfaces it glides, but some will find their way through the suspension�s electronic countermeasures and cause unluxurious sensations.  Again, generally of the parts not quite harmonizing together like they should.

You might say the car, even in DTS form, was not meant for hard driving, even if the styling suggests otherwise.  But many of these issues will creep up in normal driving as well.  That�s why the LS400, also intended for luxury rather than sport use, performs as well as it does when called upon.  The pieces in that car know how to work together in any situation.  Those in this car don�t.  

All is not lost.  If you are dead set on a large American luxury car, there are none better.  The Continental has all of the above faults and then some.  In the Town Car you sink waist deep in unsupportive cushions and can barely see over the high dash.  The Seville is smaller, pricier, and probably no better a performer.  It shares the same basic chassis and powertrain.   The Park Avenue has the same basic chassis but lacks the electronics to hide some of its faults (yet for the money may be a better buy if you need this size car).  Just go with the regular DeVille, which doesn't pretend to be what it is not and is cheaper besides.  Adjusting for its less lofty mission, I would give the regular DeVille 4 stars.

So, this is the best large American luxury car.  But that is only by default. It should be better.  In short, I�m still waiting.<br><br>
