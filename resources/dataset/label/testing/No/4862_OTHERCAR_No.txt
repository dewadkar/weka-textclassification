            After reading all the reviews here I decided this was the digi for me and told my husband who bought it for me for xmas.

I was so excited when I got it and started taking pics right away, first thing I noticed that drives me nuts is that it makes you either delete or save EACH pic after you take it. I do not like that I prefer to decide later if I like a picture.  Its also a pain when people are waiting on you.  yes I could switch it to rapid shoot, but then it does the SAME thing and the pics are to tiny to see.

(UPDATE: I recently found out that this can be turned on and shut off, I could not find it in the manual but was shown when I returned the camera.)

This is the first camera I have owned that I had to get out the book to figure it out. I am a professional photographer and this is not an easy camera to use.  The lag time between when you "click" and when the shutter releases is to long, try taking a picture of a moving child or pet.  Even when they sit still a slight movement messes up the entire picture.

There are way to many buttons to do simple things, forget trying to take a picture with it set to manual focus, it does NOT work well at all. And its to complicated to try and figure out anyhow, what ever happened to manually focusing via the lens? (yes i know it's not a 35mm..lol) 

The flash is not bright enough, even with several lights on AND the flash, the pictures are just to dark.

And if you barely move while taking a shot, it blurs badly. I have a very steady hand and this camera is way to sensitive to movement.

I also do not care for the color view finder and LCD, its very poor quality and you cannot tell how well the picture looks until you take it, in other words, when you look through the viewfinder it looks terrible and it is not clear.

This camera also hurts my hand, I don't find it at all comfortable to hold, especially when your trying to push all the stupid buttons.

I was very hesitant to buy a fuji, I never cared for them, I should have stuck with my view on this brand.  this camera is going back.


I wish I could find an upgraded Kodak DC240, I bought my DC240 4 years ago for 235.00 and it was reconditioned, and it still works great.  I just wanted a new one with more.

Also I would like to add, this camera does have great zoom, but forget trying to get up close to an item and take a picture, it just will not focus. The macro feature is just not very good IMO.

Now remember, I may be an expert when it comes to photography, but not when it comes to writing reviews, I tell it like I see it and am not a professional writer.

I am not saying this is a bad camera, there are MANY people who LOVE this camera.  But I feel this camera is not for me and so i posted my review with the things I did not like about this camera.

Read all the reviews, go test out the camera in the store, ask questions, and if you cannot figure something out, ask the sales person to show you. Check out other cameras and then decide which one you like best.

I have noticed with most newer digital cameras that lag time is a problem, hopefully they will be able to fix that soon..The one I have had for 4 years, has NO lag time..
Love it, but I need more zoom, and good macro which my old one does not have any macro.
