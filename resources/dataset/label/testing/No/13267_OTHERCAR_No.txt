            My Dad bought this car because my Mom has had one for years and loves hers, but 1999 brought a new undesirable 'feature' to the Accord that you should watch out for.  Here's what they have to say:
Things to LOVE about this car:  
� Reliable car; gets you where you are going without a fuss.
 I�d trust it in any weather conditions.
� Plenty of room for four; an occasional fifth is snug fit.
� Smooth ride.  Quieter than previous years.
� Styling - The interior is bigger, prettier, and very plush for a car in this price range.
� Lots of extras - in and out - add to the perceived value.
� Great mileage - 25 for mixed city and highway driving; low 30s, long distance.
Things to HATE about this car:
The starter CLUNKs!  Be sure to check the starter before you purchase. We didn�t hear it before we bought it, now we own it.  Believe it: &quot;Every car on the road is a used car!&quot;

Recent design change, intended to cushion the motor noise, introduced a noisy start-up in the 1999 Accord. Honda America engineers confirm that the Hydraulic Motor Mount rests on the frame, and when the vacuum is released at start-up, it produces a loud thunk and a shudder that can be felt along the frame of the car. Since there has not been enough negative feedback on the issue, there was no change in the 2000 Accord!

Our complaint has been documented at the Dealership, the Customer Hot Line, Honda America, the Honda BBB Auto Line, and BBB Arbitration team.  The manufacturer�s answer: &quot;Since it is not a safety factor, it does not qualify under the lemon law.&quot;
