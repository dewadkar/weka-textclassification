            My 96 GMC Safari has required many expensive repairs.  In December 98, my Safari, just 2 years old with 58,000 miles on it, needed a NEW ENGINE.  A nightmare!!!!  After much frustration, repeated calls to GM and the dealership, GM covered all but $500 of a $5,000 bill for the new engine.  Fortunately, I had all of my maintenance performed by the dealer on a regular basis, which helped to get GM to cover most of the cost of the new engine. Just 3 months later, in March 99, my van needed a new front axle and idler arms---another $1200 in repairs.  In June 99, I needed a new front differential---another $790 in repairs, a negotiated amount from the $1000 of actual cost.  I actually ended up stranded on the side of an interstate with smoke pouring out from under my van.  I thought the van was going to catch on fire!  Since then I've continued to have repairs made---windshield wiper motor, main lock mechanism, etc.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE GMC SAFARI BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCE!!!!<br><br>
