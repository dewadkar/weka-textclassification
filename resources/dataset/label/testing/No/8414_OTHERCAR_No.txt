            In all fairness I have to preface my comments with the admission that I did buy a reconditioned model. The wisdom involved in that decision is another subject.  Now, on to my experience.  Initially I was delighted with the quality of the pictures I was able to take with the camera.  I found the interface with the PC a bit clumsy but not any more so than with the other digital cameras I have used.  The real problem with this camera is its ability to devour batteries.  Its obscene.  I bought the rechargeables which did cut down somewhat on the expense, but its inconvenient and annoying to have to constantly carry around backups.  The major sticking point I have is with Olympus itself.  I have now sent the camera back twice because it has simply stopped working.  I have taken under 100 photographs with it and will have spent over $300.00 in repair costs (plus the cost of shipping it for the repairs).  It seems to break down just after the warranty on work expires.  There is nothing I have done to cause it to fail, it simply sits on the shelf in between use, and I'll go to use it and voila, its dead.  Olympus service is slow and their failure to address the issue of an obvious lemon is disappointing.  I would not purchase another Olympus camera.
