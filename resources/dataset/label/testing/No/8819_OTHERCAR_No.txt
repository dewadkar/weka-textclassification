            After doing comparison driving of the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Saturn LS-2 and VW Passat, I was disappointed in the Accord. I went into the dealership expecting to drive a great car, but left confused. After reading so many positive reviews, I was surprised that the handling, comfort and overall quality of the Accord was not what I expected. The salesman was kind enough to let me put the Accord through its paces, and I admit I pushed the envelope trying all of the cars. We were able to go to some little used roads where I worked the car hard. Trying the slalom, the car showed an extreme amount of roll, and the variable assist steering made it hard to steer at the slower speeds. There seemed to be a fair amount of torque steer ( what happens when you accelerate heavily in a front wheel drive car) with the car having a tendency to pull to the right. The suspension while comfortable felt a little mushy to me with it displaying a fair amount of understeer throughout the test drive. The V-6 though, was responsive and accelerated nicely up speed with 0-60 being just under 10 seconds. The transmission shifted well and it kicked down into passing with no surge. There was a noticeable amount of front end dip upon hard braking, but the ABS brakes worked well. The pulsing of the brake pedal under heavy lockup was not bad.  The Camry was very comfortable but even mushier in suspension compared to the Accord. For overall speed and performance the Passat was the winner, but the car was also priced $8000 higher than the equivalent Accord. Surprisingly, the Saturn LS-2 performed better than both the Accord and Camry and for the price was better than all three.  If you are serious about a mid-size car my best suggestion is to test drive all four cars and make the decision on how the car feels to you. If you aren't a performance minded driver, then the Accord might be the Car for you. I purchased the Saturn LS-2<br><br>
