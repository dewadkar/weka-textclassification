            Since everyone seems to be in love with this camera, I would like to take this opportunity to present the negative viewpoints of the camera, and thus justify why I do not recommend this camera: 
	CONS

-The camera cannot be turned on with lens cap in place. You get an LCD error message, requiring you to switch camera off, then on again. I would prefer that it give a viewfinder LED and audible warning instead

-The zoom control is located on a ring surrounding shutter release, and the minimum aperture is f8. Furthermore, the buttons on the back in way of thumb & should be closer to middle of camera. 

- I can�t convert the Video format, AVI, to something smaller like MPEG, as it seems blocked by Canon.

-The FULL AUTO mode is definitely not designed for indoor shooting especially under Sulfur vapor lights. Also under fluorescent lighting, picture are always severely under exposed. 
Obviously the G1's programming has never taken into account those lights 

-The Dial for mode switching is used for too many things causing you sometimes to switch out of a selected option thus causing horribly shot pictures. 

-The rubber cover over the PC connection and power are cumbersome to use. 

-In addition, the lens cover does not fit over lens when it is extended. I can�t get the lens to retract unless I shut the camera to off or it times out. 

-I don�t like the fact that the software constantly asks you to select applications every time you link to your PC. 

-Terrible flimsy rubber cover over input/output terminals.

-The swivel LCD is neat but does not rotate a full 360 degrees. Someone may break it off if in a hurry or not familiar with operation. 

-The Tripod mount off-center, which could cause some problems with set shooting situations. 

- The Diopter adjustment wheel is far to small, and is also hard to adjust. In this situation, I think that the remote is definitely handy.

In addition, the lack of a focusing aid (ie. enlargement area) is a weakness as one generally has to depend upon the camera's auto-focus capability. Of course there is a focus set feature for non-centered subjects, but it is not always clear (in the view screen) when this procedure is needed. Deleting pictures one at a time takes 3 button pushes: set, right, set. Perhaps a small issue, but this is one push too many and set has to be used twice in row to delete 2 adjacent shots. The lack of a large, rubberized handgrip makes me feel a wee bit insecure. I am considering some anti-slip tape over some of the smooth areas on the right side of the camera.

In conclusion, despite the fact that this camera has made remarkable advancements in the area of digital camera technology, I would much rather wait for a camera that has less kinks in it than to spend my $800 on a camera that will surely become obsolete in a few years.
