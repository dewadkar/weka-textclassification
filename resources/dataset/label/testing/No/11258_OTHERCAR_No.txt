            The Dodge Intrepid was redesigned a couple years ago. Originally created to compete against the Ford Taurus and the Toyota Camry, Dodge's main sedan competed by giving you more car for the money. Bigger than either Taurus or the Camry, the Intrepid excels in offering the most space in the competitive family sedan marketplace.

<b>Engine:</b>
This was why I rented the Intrepid. I wanted a big safe car to drive from LA to San Francisco. Engine was torquey and perfectly mated to a smooth auto transmission. This car easily passed other cars and has great highway manners

<b>Interior:</b>
Ergonomics was fine but the design of the dash was disappointingly bland. Also, the choice of a dark charcoal meant that in the dusk, some dashboard features were hard to see. Also, because of the extreme rake of the windshield, a lot of the interior space seems to be just the space about the dashboard. Material quality was dreadful as I found material unravelling at the seams where the dash pieces met - could it have been premature sun-aging? Interior door panels did not fit well, also contributing to tear.

<b>Handling:</b>
A pleasure to drive, the Intrepid balances the family sedan with the ability to become a sports sedan. But, because of its size and the angle of the windshield and hoodline, this is a tough car to maneuver in tight city spaces.

<b>Overall</b>
It wasn't too long ago that Chrysler/Dodger/Plymouth saved itself from bankruptcy with the bland-bland K-car. Since then, they've come up with some innovative designs such as the mini-van and more recently, the PT Cruiser. I can see that the engineering at Chrysler is top-notch. My experience with the Intrepid shows that the manufacturing needs to match the quality of the engineering - especially given how competitive the 4-door sedan marketplace is.
