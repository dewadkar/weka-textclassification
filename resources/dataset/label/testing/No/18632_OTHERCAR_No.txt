            Last year I needed a new car.  I thought about a few different models but in the end I chose the Alero.  I thought it was sporty, something new that no one around me had and it had a great price!  I loved the car, even though I had a few problems with leasing it.  
Eleven months after I had the car, the problems started.  I had less than 11,000 miles on it. I started my car one morning and the power seat kept moving forward until I was all the way against my steering wheel.  The next thing to go were the brakes!  I landed two feet away from the bank!! More problems came about.  The final straw was when I went to my car, after a heavy rain, the floor behind the driver's seat had a puddle of water!  Finally it had to go in.  Well, it has been in the shop on and off for the past few months and half the time for more than a day.
If you can handle problems and taking time to bring it in the shop, then I say go ahead and buy it!  Maybe it is just my vehicle.  Personally, I wouldn't want another one.  If you can find one without all the problems, I would say go for it.  It does have great styling and a reasonable price<br><br>
