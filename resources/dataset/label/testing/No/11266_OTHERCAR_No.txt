            I bought my 2000 Forester L in November of 1999.  At the time, it was the only mini-ute I considered.  (My wife already driving a 2000 Outback Limited)  I am a car nut, age 15 through college I held every job possible in the Automotive field.  I really know my cars and have recommended Subaru's to many friends and family.  WELLLLLL --- NO MORE!!!!!!!!  If you own a 2000 Forester you should be aware that there is a factory rear wheel alignment problems with them!  At 2,800 miles I had significantly poor tire wear on the rear tires.  The dealer replaced the two rear tires and re-aligned the car under warranty. (The next week they received a bulletin from Subaru about the factory alignment problem).  At 5,600 miles I noticed that I was still having a wear problem and the car went back.  They checked it out and sure enough the alignment was STILL OUT.  They re-aligned the car and sent me on my way.  At 8,600 miles I was STILL HAVING A PROBLEM!  I took the car back, they had their wheel alignment machine re-calibrated and had two different people align the car and put four new Michelin tires on it.  I left that day with a pull to the right and a fuse that had been completely used up.  I went, the next day, to an independent shop and had the alignment checked (Not serviced).  Sure enough, it was still not correct.  So, I called Subaru and arranged to meet the area representative at the dealer a few weeks later.  At 14,000 (I now drive 1,200 miles a week) miles, there I was, the rep., the service manager, and I all in my car.  Was Subaru going to own up to the fact that this car was a lemon and replace it under the Pennsylvania Lemon Law? Even with the problem of tire wear still persisting, the pull, and a very unhappy customer, they decided that there was no longer anything wrong with the car.  My answer: I now have to retain an attorney and go after Subaru under the Lemon Law.  Basically, Subaru DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THE PRODUCTS THEY PRODUCE!!!!!!!!!  If the car was in proper order, I would enjoy it despite a small list of items that were a real oversight when they built this car.  As I said, this was the only car I considered at the time of purchase.  In theory, all the other mini-ute's do not even come close in comparison.  We were basically happy with our Outback and I had owned an older Subaru I sold running strong with 193,000 miles.  It was a real ego buster for me to buy a base model &quot;wagon&quot; at 27 years old but, my new job was going to require a lot of driving for a few years and I wanted cheap, economical, 4 wheel drive, and reliable transportation.  The first 2,800 miles, that is what I thought I had purchased. Now, at 17,000 miles I can hardly stand to look at it.  I am completely disgusted with Subaru!!  If you own a 2000 Forester, do not let the dealer tell you that the tire wear is due to your driving habits!!  It is due to a factory problem that they have not sent a recall out on!!!!!!!!!  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I do not believe that all Forester's have a problem as bad as mine.  Most likely, the average car with an alignment problem can be fixed.  Mine however, is an extreme case.  I actually belive the problem is deeper that a simple alignment.      <br><br>
