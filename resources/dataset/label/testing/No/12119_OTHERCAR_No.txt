            I recently rented a new 2001 Mazda 626 LX 4-cyl. for two days at the SEA TAC airport Hertz location.  It had 3,804 miles on the odometer.  We previously owned an '84 Touring GT (5-door hatchback) Mazda 626 that we were pretty happy with for 10+ years and 134K miles.  Since then, we have owned a and '90 Toyota Camry 4-cyl., a 6-cyl. '88 Acura Legend L Sedan and a 6-cyl. '95 Toyota Avalon LS.  So, we have a good background to compare this rental vehicle against for performance, comfort, handling and relative value.  I found it very dated in almost all areas except, perhaps exterior styling.

<b>Comfort & Space:</b> The Mazda 626 is not as large and roomy as the new Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.  The front bucket seats were fine but it severely lacked adequate legroom in the rear.  The driving position was fine except the gas pedal seemed too far to the right.  The seat adjustments were fine but there was no lumbar support adjustment.  I found that interesting since our old '84 Mazda had that feature.  Vision forward and out the rear via the mirrors was very good and the power mirrors were easy to use and adjust.  The transmission selector lever on the center console was the perfect height and position for easy and quick use.  It was so well-positioned that it was a good hand rest for the right hand.  The dash and gauges were easy to see and very clear with no confusion.  The cruise control was intuitive to use as was the wiper controls.  One nice feature, when the cruise control was engaged, a dash light indicator lit up.  However, there was no temporary way to defeat the set cruise speed without stepping on the brakes.  There was no manual defeat short of turning off the cruise control feature.  Two built-in, recessed, covered cup holders in the center console behind the shift lever was a nice touch and very easy to use.  Another nice touch was the motor-driven "sweeping" motion of the front air ducts for the heater/A/C air stream into the passenger compartment.  And, the electric rear trunk lid release on the driver's door is a nice touch instead of the standard manual cable operated lever on most other vehicles in this class.

<b>Engine Performance:</b>  This was the really sad part of my experience.  Compared to our 4-cyl.. Camry, this was a real dog.  It was noisy even under moderate acceleration and really had to work hard with a lot of noise and a thrashing feeling when asked for maximum acceleration.  Yet, this was a 2 liter, 16-valve DOHC engine.  I found it disconcerting that an 11-year old Camry 4-cyl., 16-valve engine with 220K miles, would easily outperform a new Mazda 4-cyl., especially with DOHC for added performance.  The Camry is a little larger and heavier but it easily out accelerates the new Mazda and without all the commotion under the hood.  I had to open the hood to inspect the engine to be sure it was a 16-valve design, that's how dissatisfied and disappointed I was in this engine's performance.  I really can't find anything good to say about it.  To give the driver the impression of peppy performance, it had a very touchy gas pedal - meaning a little pedal depression gave a lot of gas to the engine.  This was to make you think you had a lot of power remaining in pedal travel.  It's a sham.  Other cars do the same thing, however.

<b>Transmission:</b>  The automatic transmission is a  4-speed, electronic controlled AT with overdrive.  I was really unhappy with this automatic transmission.  It is, it is terribly outdated.  It surges and lunges when up/down shifting around town and hunts on long uphills.  It lags and surges on deceleration.  When letting off the gas pedal at freeway speeds, there is a lurch as if there is play in the spline or drive shafts.  The same lurch is felt upon letting up on the gas pedal at speed.  The shifts are not crisp or smooth and seem slow going in/out of gear.  It reminded me of an older, purely mechanical automatic transmission instead of the newer, more sophisticated EC transmissions of today.  It did have an overdrive lockout button mounted right on the shift lever that was easily operated by the thumb for easy control.  But that's small consolation for such miserable performance in getting the tepid power from the engine to the front wheels.

<b>Handling:</b>  Again, this is an outdated chassis.  It felt like and handled just like my '84 without the selectable dampening rates for the shocks.  I did not get a chance to check the specs but I suspect it is still a disc-front and drum-rear for the braking system.  This model did not have the ABS feature but I did check it out by locking up the brakes at 35, 45 and 60 MPH and the vehicle never veered from straight ahead with moderate dive of the front end.  Pedal modulation was easy and showed very little signs of fade after 5 different lock-up trials.  I never really got a chance to find the lateral skid limits of the vehicle but it seemed adequate for normal handling.  There were no excessive signs of understeer in hard cornering or acceleration or oversteer in deceleration in corners.  But, the steering was numb and a bit vague with absolutely no road feel - no feedback, whatsoever.  And, there was a lot of road noise and vibration coming through the suspension and undercarriage.

<b>Summary:</b>  You get what you pay for.  The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry are more expensive but you get more value for your money.  The 626 is smaller, less sophisticated, lower in performance and is noisier in both engine and road noise.  And, the automatic transmission is definitely sub-standard.  In my opinion, it is no longer a good value compared to the competition even if it is cheaper.  You might wish to consider a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic for purchase if you were thinking about a Mazda 626.  Sorry!
