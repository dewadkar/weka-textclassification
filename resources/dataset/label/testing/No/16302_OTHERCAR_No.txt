            I am a seller on Ebay and needed a good camera to take pictures of the items I sell.  I mainly used this camera to take pictures of clothing.

When I first brought the camera home I took pictures outside, of just anything.  The pictures came out beautiful.  I was impressed.

Then I tried it to take pictures of clothing.  I was very disappointed.  Forget about taking pictures of anything red, orange, coral, dark pink or anything around those colors.  Turns out like just one big blob.  Horrible pictures.  They were so bad, you could barely tell what the picture was supposed to be of.  

Then I tried taking pictures of black clothing.  A big black blob.  I tried a test. I stood in one spot, and took a picture with the flash.  Came out very dark and horrible quality.  I didn't move and took a 2nd picture again, with the flash.  It came out very bright - made something dark black look like it was light gray.  Wow!  Then I did that with lots of other colors and it was the same way.  Half the times the pictures would come out dark, half the times they would look way too bright.  There was no happy medium.  

Another thing I didn't like about this camera was that if you took a bad picture, you couldn't delete it immediately.  You have to turn the camera off (close the lens), and then press the button to turn it back on, then press the button AGAIN, to turn the LCD screen on again, and then find the picture you want to delete and THEN you could delete it.  Then, you had to open the lens, turn it back on, press &quot;OK&quot; to take pictures and you could take another picture.  All that hassle to delete one measley picture!  And with all the BAD pictures this camera took - that was a lot of having to turn on/off to delete each picture.

I guess if you are using this camera to take nice outdoor shots it will work fine.  But if you plan on using it to take indoor shots, the camera is just about worthless.  I tried it indoors with every single kind of lighting possible and nothing worked.  <br><br>
