            Simply put, owning a Jeep Wrangler (at least a pre-97) is great on short trips, off road &amp; at the beach, but horrible as a commuter vehicle especially on the highway. I bought my 1995 Wrangler 5-Speed 4cyl new for $14,000 with all basic options, but no A/C (a mistake). These trucks are very basic, but well-built and in the 2 years I owned it, it was reliable. 


The Pros:
There are 3 situations where the Wrangler is simply THE BEST vehicle to have: At the beach on a nice day with the top off, off road, and around town in bad weather. In those 3 situations there is no better vehicle to have, PERIOD! It's the perfect &quot;extra&quot; vehicle to have, just for fun. There are a lot of cool aftermarket parts available to do what ever you want with it.

The Cons:
If your looking for a commuting or highway vehicle, STAY AWAY from a Wrangler. Even if you don't intend to use it to drive to work in or on a highway you may still have to take it on highway occasionally to get to that beach or mountain and that's where the problems start. The Jeep Wrangler may not seem so bad at first on the highway until you realize you can't hear the radio because there is so much engine/drivetrain/wind noise (even with the hard-top on). On the highway with the soft-top, you can't even hear your passengers talking to you and wonder if your going to have permanent hearing loss after driving for a while. The ride in a Wrangler is a bit bouncy around town (and there is nothing you can do about it since it has leaf springs front/rear), but tolerable. On the highway, the ride is absoluetly AWEFUL! In fact, I had back and neck aches by the time I got to work every morning driving this truck on the highway for just 30 minutes. It's like driving a bucking horse. If your 18 years old you can take the pounding, but not when your 30. Another problem on the highway is with the 4cyl engine. It has decent power around town and gets about 19 MPG overall, but take it on the highway up a hill and you will wish you purchased the 6cyl. I had trouble maintaining 50 MPH on some stretches of highway going up a hill with the pedal to the floor.

This is the perfect extra vehicle to have for fun in the sun or off-road. As a commuting vehicle you will hate it and probably sell it, like I did. I wish I could have afforded to keep it for the weekends only.  <br><br>
