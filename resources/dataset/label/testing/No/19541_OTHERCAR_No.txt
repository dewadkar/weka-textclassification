            I had a 1994 740iL BMW - I thought that all of my dreams came true - a big luxury automobile that I can take skiing without buying ski racks (the wonderful pass through feature from the trunk to the rear seat). This car was fast, handled amazingly well, just a feast for the driver's senses.  What more could a young upwardly mobile type want.  It projected the image I wanted & showed where I wanted to go . . . then the honeymoon was over!  Maintenance costs were unbelieveable . . . and the worse wasn't over yet - at 69,000 miles, and only 4 months out of warranty, the transmission blew.... a $7500 repair. Then I learn that this is a common occurrence in the 4.0 liter engine cars (read 740 & 540).  My mechanic had several in the prior 6 months!!! This is something BMW doesn't want you to know... and won't help out with.  Some research later I learn that the another common problem with this car is the ENGINE!!!  I sold mine before that problem came around - huge cold feet!!!  Shortly after I sold it, I saw another one list for sale that stated it had a new engine!!! This was a complete bummer!!!!  If you can afford the risk, by all means, this car is awesome!!! If you can afford the repairs, you probably can afford a new one.  The rest of the world - stay away!!!
