            For 30,000 you can easily buy something better than this.  I mean look at the thing, for one, ITS UGLY!!  Nothing special about the design, nothing special about the way it drives, it handles like a cement trunk, and it isn't exactly luxorious.  This is by far the worst SUV on the market, and it isn't even the cheapest!!??!

The interior is average with leather seats.  Nothing is special, just a plain interior.  It's pathetic that Oldsmobile is asking for 30 grand for a sub par vehicle.  Hey, at least it has the navigation system?

WELL, DONT BUY THIS CAR DONT BUY THIS CAR DONT BUY THIS CAR DONT BUY THIS CAR DONT BUY THIS CAR DONT BUY THIS CAR DONT BUY THIS CAR!!!!!!<br><br>
