            I was once a true blue Toyota owner. Now I am very unhappy with the company. My brother and I both purchased our 93 Toyota, Camries new at the same time, and have been unhappy ever since. The transmission went out after owning my camry 2 1/2 years. The company put in a rebuilt transmission. The motor in the automatic window of my brother's camry went out after 1 1/2 years and luckily it was still under warranty. The motor in my window went out after 2 years which was just out of warranty and the company paid for the part but refused to pay for the labor, though my brother had the same problem and it appeared to be a manufacturer's defect. The dealership told me it was not a defect, but when my transmission went out another Toyota dealership said the window was a defect. Then my brother's window motor went out again, the dealership covered the price, not the manufacturer. The next problem my brother had was with his alignment. He had to have it realigned repeatedly and the autoshop said they have had problems this car before. The next problem was with my car the transmission started to act up again 3 1/2 years later. The dealership said it was going out and would cost 2,500 dollars but because we couldn't produce records showing the transmission service they wouldn't cover it. So we took it to a transmission shop. They said the diagnostics showed the transmission was fine and they serviced the transmission and put in an additive and now it is fine. All this to say neither my brother nor myself will purchase a Toyota until they put more effort into supporting their product. I owned a Toyota before this, and was very happy with the quality of the vehicle. The high price of the vehicle makes me very leary of  taking the chance again. I have been told since that we must have bought during a bad year. Just not ready to take another chance. Beware, especially when their are other companies that do support their product.   <br><br>
