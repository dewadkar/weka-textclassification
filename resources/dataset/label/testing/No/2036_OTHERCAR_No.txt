Admentment to this review..  Unfortunately, KIA's much vaulted 10 Year / 100,000 mile warranty doesn't hold water.  I had my front tires wear out after 12,000 miles and KIA is REFUSING to honor their warranty!!!  STAY AWAY FROM KIA!!!!
=======================================================


OK, lets start this off by saying that we're not taking about a Mercedes, Volvo, Lexus or even a Honda here - we're talking about some good basic, inexpensive transportation.

Kia has certainly taken part of the hits that the Korean car industry has taken in general in the US market in recent years.  You don't see too many 10 year old Hyundai's on the road, and Daewoo was here and gone so fast that you never did quite figure out who named their cars, and what those names meant.  But through it all was steady Kia.  You may not have known that Kia's were on the road here well before they put a car on our shores with their own nameplate (think Ford Festiva) - so they are a company with a history, and they do know how to make a good car.

I'll be the first to admit that what attracted me to the Kia were two things -- price and warranty.  Where else could I get a great 10-year warranty like that AND get a 4-door sedan for under $13,000 (and when I got mine, there was a rebate on top of that)! 

I purchased this car primarily as a commuter car to get me back and forth to work - and it was perfect for the job.  A basic model with Air, AM/FM Radio and Power Steering thrown in, and I got a car that will basically get me there and back for a number of years to come.

Because I always run the air, and only do city driving, I, on average, only get 21 miles per gallon.  The Heating/Air work quickly, and the car drives reasonably well.  The seat position is good for my six-foot five frame (nothing short of a Lincoln Towncar will be absolutely comfortable - but at least I fit), but I'd not recommned for extended highway trips.  This blue four door sedan looks good, drives well and (thus far) always starts when I need it to.

The fit and finish is on par with any average car on the road. It has slight road noise from the doors, but nothing major.  It's instrument panel layout is well thought out, and the cubby-holes laid out like they are actually meant to be used. I like this cute, little car, and am proud to say that I am a Kia owner.

With this car, what you see is what you get. No, it's not the most refined car on the road; no, it doesn't drive like a Lexus; and, no it's not "your fathers Oldsmobile" that will just &#147float down the road&#148 - but what it is is a good little car for commuting, for a student just starting out, for a 2nd car or for a family on a budget looking for quality transportation.

Kia has a logo on their price sticker that states that they make "Darn Good Cars" and after having this model since August '01, I am inclined to agree with them.
