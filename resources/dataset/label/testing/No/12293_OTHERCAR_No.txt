            I just traded this car today so I'm ready to vent.  This car is the ultimate under-achiever.  Good motor, but not up to it's competition.  Good suspension, but not up to it's competition.

These things would be OK if the rest of the car wasn't so hard to live with.  To be fair, the car never left me stranded, but the amount of recall work negated this fact.

The interior is well laid out and comfortable.  The problem comes in the materials and assembly.  The prime word here is CHEAP.  The plastic is hard and dull to look at and scratches very easily.  The center console moves left-to-right more than a Libertarian, and the carpet breeds some kind of mold that is all but impossible to kill.  The worst thing about the carpet is that it appears to be coinciding with a design flaw that causes water to condense under the seats and then drip on the carpet.  This moisture leads to pools of water that only dry up when the humidity level falls below 40%, which doesn't happen often in Tennessee.  After fighting the mold for a year, I finally found something that could actually kill it: Oxyclean.  To kill the mold I had to remove the driver's seat and soak the carpet with Oxyclean for an hour, scrub on it for about 30 minutes, then soak it again for another hour.  After all of this the dead mold could not be extracted from the carpet, but it never started growing again.  I treated the entire interior in the manner to prevent further mold outbreaks.

Now, this is a sports car, right?  It sure looks like one.  And if you get on the gas it sounds like one too.  The exhaust note may well be the best thing about the car.  The problem is that with only 205 horse power and 205 pound-feet of torque, it just is too much car at 3400 pounds.  The engine is smooth all the way to redline, which you will visit often if trying to keep up with a more nimble car such as a Celica GTS, or a more powerful car such as the Mustang GT.  Keeping the revs up would be a lot more fun with a decent transmission.  The 5-speed in the Eclipse is horrible.  It is very vague.  It's not uncommon to attempt to leave a red-light in third because the synchros wouldn't let it go into first.

There is apparently a design flaw in the steering and engine mounts that has spawned two recals and creates some unusual sounds under hard driving.  When I attempted to race this car in Solo II Autocrossing, I quickly discovered that if you jump on the brakes hard and then get right back on the gas in first gear that the engine would smack the firewall resulting in a thunk so loud that I thought I had just ripped out a motor mount.  When I stopped and inspected that the engine was indeed still mounted correctly I got back in and began verifying how to make this phenomenon reoccur.  When I spoke to two different dealers about it, they claimed that the car was not designed for that type of manuevering and that any damage would be my fault.  This is in stark contrast to the previous generations of Eclipse which Mitsubishi gleefully provided great incentive for racing the Eclipse in SCCA events.

Another serious problem is that the gearing for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears is WAY too low, and for some strange reason Mitsubishi lowered them even more for the 2003 model.

In first gear, wheelspin is evoked in straight line acceleration when the RPMs hit about 4000 with the stock tires.  Replacing the Goodyear Eagle GS-A all weather tires helped a lot, but if the wheel is not dead straight, there will be wheel spin at full throttle.  If the Eclipse had the acceleration numbers to match this machismo it wouldn't be a bad thing.  Second gear redlines at 58 mph, which means that you have to shift again before hitting 60.  You can hold second gear to 62 MPH at which point the fuel cut off kicks in and the car stalls until RPM is below 5000.  Third gear doesn't quite give you 85 MPH before you hit the fuel cut off.  Fourth and Fifth gears feel just right with the car topping out at an indicated 147 MPH in Fifth.  At that speed the car is more stable that one would expect for such an inexpensive car.

Again, all of this would be great if it wasn't for how good the competition is.  For the same price of the Eclipse GT, you can buy a Mustang GT that has 55 more HP and 100 pound-feet more torque.  The Mustang trounces the Eclipse in every performance measure possible, and on the road you don't dare provoke a late-model Mustang GT.

On the handling side you get a car that is very competant.  It can get around a track very well.  But the real world is a bit different.  The suspension gets light on real roads which have more elevation changes than the typical race track and the car feels like the understeer is always closer than it really is.  It takes a long time to get the confidence that the car isn't going to push into the ditch on the other side of the road.  The car has a horrible 65/35 front/rear weight bias with the V6.  Why Mitsubishi didn't angle the engine back more is a real mystery, especially considering you already have to take the entire top end of the motor apart to change the firewall side spark plugs (which Mitsubishi recommends changing every 30,000 miles).  A positive note is that if you get rid of the stock Eagle GS-As and replace them with some serious rubber (I purchased Dunlop ultra-high performance tires from Tire Rack) the understeer is greatly reduced and the car feels more stable.

So, what did I like about the car?  The seats.  The front seats of this car are perfection for cruising on the interstate, hopping around town, and running the autocross.  If Ford could learn to make seats this good the Mustang would sell another 25,000 units per year.  The driving position is nearly perfect and the steering wheel is the perfect size and shape.  Long trips in short amounts of time are a breeze.  My wife and I drove from Clarksville, TN to Charleston, SC and back over the course of a 3 day weekend and never once got butt-burn or felt the need to stop to stretch our legs.

Overall I am disappointed after the two and half years I owned the car.  The car's fuel tank is too small and requires a fillup every 300 miles.  The fun-to-drive quotient is down compared to the previous generation.  Finally, for the money you can have a better sports car (Mustang GT) or a better Grand Tourer (Accord Coupe).  And over at the Acura dealer you can get an RS that is  both a better sports car and grand tourer!
