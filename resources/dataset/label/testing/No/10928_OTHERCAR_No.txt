            We have been beloved BMW lovers for many years. Both my wife and I just love the way BMW 3 series looks and we were destined to buy one someday.
That was our dream. When the year 2000 BMW 328i came out, which is the
new style we said to ourself that this is the time to buy. We actually
leased the 2000 BMW 328i.

We took delivery of the new car in Auguest, 1999. And since then our
dream car is turning into a nightmare!! A car which we'd love to get
rid of right away, a car which we think is so poorly build and engineered
and over priced. 

After about 1500 miles we started experiencing problems with the car.
One day we were driving on the highway about 70 miles/hour. The engine
started shaking (misfiring), the car totally loose throttle response
while the engine is misfiring and fuel cut off at 55 miles per hour. It 
wouldn't let me drive more than that, so we merged into the slowest
lane hoping to get home. In the instrument panel we can see the hazard
light, the cooling system warning light, and the &quot;EML&quot; light lit up.
We pulled over to the shoulder, both me and my wife looked at each other
and paused, can this be the quality of a new BMW? We shut the engine off,
waited a few minutes, started again, but the problem did not go away.
We managed to drive the car off the very next exit and went home locally.

It was very freightening, imagine yourself going 70+ miles on the highway,
with your new born baby, and your newly bought car which claims to be
the safest and the &quot;Ultimate driving machine&quot; suddenly shacking and cease
power while the engine idels &quot;VERY&quot; rough and won't let you accelerate
over 55 mph. You're forced to merge into the slow traffic lane without knowing what is happening with your new car.Does this sound like a nightmare to you? It sure happened on our 2000 BMW 328i sedan.

The very next day we took the car in for service, at 1550 miles on the
odometer. The sales person came out and greeted us, and they were nice
enough to get a rental car. The repair took about 2 days, and they replaced many parts including the most important &quot;Throttle valve&quot;.

After the first repair, we thought the problem is repaird, but the same
problem occured again in just one month, when my wife was going to work.

The same problem has been happening off and on, intermittently, it will
happen, and go away for a few days to a few weeks, and happens again
without any reason or pattern.

We have since returned the car into the dealership for service the 
2nd time. And til' now the car is still in the shop, it has been 1 week.

So after reading this, you can tell how dissatisfied we are with this
car. We can honestly say that this is the worst car buying experiencing
that we ever had and we swear we will never buy another BMW again.

I hope the problem will go away after the 2nd repair attempt.
