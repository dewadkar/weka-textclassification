            Four recalls - mayor recalls.
Squeaky wheels from the get go.
A strange tremor when the car goes slow.
Leaking on passenger floor.
Electrical problem with a speaker.
Not even a year old.
And I am not even going into the little stuff!
And Customer Service:  Third World Attitude!
Extremely rude (must suck to work for Ford).
Misinformed.
No loaner cars.
No effective repairs.
They are really working hard at getting rid of their current client base.
Why is the American public still fooled by Ford?
Thank goodness I leased because had I paid to own this car, once the warranty goes, I would have to be paying every other month for one thing or another.  It is scary.  The car is impressive at first, but I would like to know how many people out there are applying for the lemon laws on this one.
