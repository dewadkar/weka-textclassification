            <b>As the owner of a 911 SC, I thought I'd be in for quite a treat when I recently had the occasion to take an extended test drive in a 98 Boxster.</b>  I'm a little disappointed to report that the experience left me feeling a bit underwhelmed.

<b>Is this thing on?!?</b>
Well, I guess my headers on the 911 have spoiled me - I was wondering when I turned the key whether the Boxster was actually running.  It's quiet.  The dBs start kicking up into the audible range after about 5000 rpm, and only then do you get a sense that this thing is breathing.  

<b>Uh...I should have finished my Ph.D.</b>
As someone knowledgeable in vehicle ergonomics I can tell you that the Boxster falls short on many counts.  While the gauges are nicely displayed in their own pod cluster, the speedometer is merely ornamental.  The font on the gauges is pleasing, but not the most functional.  The redundant digital speedometer below the tachometer is highly useful - Oh, I'm going <i>that</i> fast?

The radio is by far the most obvious example of poor (or no) user testing of the interior.  <b>The dull LCD looks more like a cheap fish finder or ironman triathalon watch than an intuitive sound system that should be found in this $40K Porsche.</b>  The controls were very difficult to find and use because they are hidden in layers of configured LCD screens - one for CD, one for radio, one for setting the bass, treble, etc.  I found the volume control the only immediately recognizable control.  It appeared in the proper location, closest to the driver.  The other controls would have to be learned after studying a detailed manual which I found behind the driver's seat.  

The other big miss for me, ergonomically speaking was the cruise control, wiper and turn signal stalks which are occluded by the steering wheel.  <b>I found myself leaning forward, attempting to read the text on the stalk, or worse yet, trying to figure out the meaning of the icons on the stalk ends. </b> I never was able to engage the cruise control.

I also found the seats a bit soft for my taste.  Although appointed in nice leather, the seat controls seemed difficult to use as well.  I never quite got completely comfortable on the drive.  Of course the ultra-supportive Recaros in my 911 have spoiled me a great deal too.

On the plus side, <b>the steering wheel allowed a firm 9 and 3 grip and proved to be quite nicely designed when negotiating the nimble Boxster through the twisty bits.</b>  In addition, the shifter was well proportioned with a knob design which fit perfectly in the palm of my hand.  The shifting was smooth and crisp with a short throw.

<b>Performance...come in please, we know you're out there</b>
Wow, I was really underwhelmed with the power.  Even though this mid-engine design makes 201 hp, I expected more.  My Euro 911 with the goodies and larger pistons makes about 210 hp, so I was expecting a fairly close comparison - Nope.  It may be because the Boxster weighs a few hundred more pounds too, but this in my mind was the main thing which changed my mind about the Boxster.

The shifting was sliky smooth and easy to find the gears.  The gear ratio seemed well matched to compensate for the somewhat anemic 6-cylinder engine.  The Boxster transmission was definitely a bright spot and a pleasant departure from the notchy old 911 transmission. 

<b>Handling - ok, maybe...</b>
Initial feel was a bit twitchy and nervous, but I was probably just getting used to switching from a coupe to the ragtop.  This Boxster was equipped with the sports package, including the extremely attractive 17&quot; twist wheels and beefier tires.  The road feel was good.  The Boxster soaks up the potholes and bumps with ease and transitions easily from cruising to more spirited driving.  When pushed, the Boxster returned a firm and responsive and fairly predictable feel.  With more time behind the wheel, I sensed that this could be quite a lot of fun, but coming from the rear-engined big brother, I was still a little wanting.  

<b>Suggestions</b>
If you are a 911 owner looking for a ragtop, consider the Boxster.  But also consider that that same $40K could get you a '94 911 cabriolet with about 280 horsepower and more room for passengers and luggage.  Or, if you don't have a 911 or a convertible, spend $25K and get a '94 968 Cabriolet and use the remaining $15K to get a '83 911 SC (decisions, decisions).  It depends what you're looking for, of course, but for my $ I'd be looking beyond the Boxster.<br><br>
