            I purchased my Mazda 6 almost a year ago. At first I was really happy with the style and sleakness of the car. However as time went on, it has only caused me trouble. 
The second week of having the car I was leaving the grocery store and my check engine light came on. I didn't know why, but since it was a new car I pulled over and called the dealership right away. They proceeded to tell me that it might be my gas cap is not secure, but I checked and it was fine. He told me that he is not sure what it is, but that the car shouldn't blow up and to just bring it in. Well shouldn't isn't a very good answer for me. So I brought my car in and then after fighting with them over a rental, I finally got one and was able to leave me car there for them to figure it out. It ended up being a electrical problem and was easily fixed. Easy for them, but not easy for me. 

Before I bought this car I had a 1995 Honda Accord. Soon after the excitement of getting a new car wore off (that was basically when I had to take it back the second week of having it) I realized that this car was far less of a quality car than the accord. The mpg is much worse and the turning radius is like a big truck. Also, power in the engine was not as impressive as I remember in the test drive. Anytime I go up a small incline, I have to push the car as it looses acceleration. 

There has been at least three recalls on the car so far. I was not too upset with this, since I did buy it the first year they were making them. But once again the problem was with the dealer fixing the recalls. One of the recalls is for a electrical problem. I brought my car in, they did the work and then came and told me that they needed all the keys to my car for it to work again, this meant the two regular keys plus the valet key. Which of course I only had one with me. So I had to have them get me a rental to go home and find all the other keys so my car would start again. 

The major problem that I have had that does not seem to want to go away is a noise in the front tire area. It isn't coming from the tires, but something from inside the axle or breaks. It was a noise I was hearing anytime I turned into a parking spot. I took it in and they said that it was a problem in the breaks and they put new hardware on to make the problem go away. That was about 3 months ago. Well the noise is back again. I took the car in again this weekend and they proceeded to tell me that all the noise was is dust on my breaks. I used to live out in the country and I am sorry, but that noise is not dust. I told them this and all they could say is that the next time it happens to bring it in and they will check again. 

I am considering taking this issue under CA Lemon Law because I don't want to have to keep bringing a car back for a noise that I know shouldn't be there, but they insist that it is nothing. 

Would I recommend this car? No, I don't think it is a good car that should be a quality car. I would expect these issues if I bought a Hyundai or something like that, but not a Mazda.

I have written a letter to Mazda outlining my problems with the car and with the dealership (the only one in town). All their response was, I am sorry that you are not happy with your Mazda 6... Well I am not and I will not buy another Mazda ever again.
