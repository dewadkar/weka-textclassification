            I rent cars or a living and am able to comment on a wide variety of cars an SUVs.  Recently, I had a chance to test drive a 2001 Mercury Mountaineer.  First, a few pet peeves:

1)  I hate headrests that make you tilt your head back and look at the headliner because they are positioned so far back;
2)  I do not care for wiper controls that make a person have to turn a knob before the wipers come on.  I like the wiper stalks where all you need to do is move it up or down with a finger, without taking your hands off the steering wheel; and 
3)  rattles in a nearly new car (under 3,000 miles).

As you can guess, the Mountaineer had all these &quot;features&quot;. And more.

As for the positives:
1)  excellent ride height and visibility,
2)  very safe due to ride height and vehicle mass, and
3)  shorter than most sedans while carrying a lot more.

If you still want one, I'll save you time on having to read a long winded review.  Just read the next paragraph:

With the exception of some very minor cosmetics to the front/rear of the vehicle and wheels, the Mercury Mountaineer is exactly the same as its corporate twin, the Ford Explorer, but priced higher.  I would recommend NOT paying the premium for the Mercury brand.  If you still wanna spend the extra bucks, opt instead for the Eddie Bauer Explorer, which might actually be cheaper than a comparably equiped Mountaineer.  The suspension is better, it's got bigger tires for a superior ride, and its appealing looks/paint are all around, not just the grill and wheels.

Of course, my favorite SUV remains the Toyota 4Runner, by a mile.  The 4Runner's six cylinder engine stacks up very well against the eight cylinders in the Explorer/Mountaineer.  And the 4Runner's build quality is vastly superior as well.  My Mountaineer had but 2,600 miles on it and already the console was rattling!  Alas, the 4Runner's weak point is its small gas tank.  While the FoMoCo twins do have a larger tank and an appreciably longer useful range, all SUVs are gas hogs.

One last advantage of the Explorer/Mountaineer is that there are soooo many of them out there.  This may prove beneficial should one need spare/ remanufactured parts, desire after market bolt-on items, or find himself needing to blend in with the crowd.  Say, for instance, in a witness protection program.  Duck!<br><br>
