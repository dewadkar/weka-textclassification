            In 1992 I bought my first new car, also my first stick shift.  It was a Suzuki Swift.  I later learned that this is the same car as the Geo Metro.  I called this car &quot;the mighty moon rover&quot; because it could go over cavernous terrain (potholes) without problems.  This car was fantastic.  One day I ran over a hunk of cement that took out the transmission and banged up the undercarriage a LOT.  The car saved me though because there was plenty of shielding around fuel lines, etc, that I was in no danger.  Needless to say, I miss that car.

Having such wonderful experience with that car, I wanted the same thing again, so I bought a 1996 Geo Metro.  I didn't get a Suzuki because I couldn't get another 4-door, but I could get one with the Geo (LSi, 4-door, stick).  I heard that some of the problems in the Swift were worked out in this model (stainless steel exhaust for example).  That turned out to be a mistake.  This was the worst car I owned.

From day one the gas gauge didn't read right, and having it in the shop three times didn't fix it.  But that was only the gas gauge, I can live with it.  After about a year the transmission acted up.  Second gear would grind periodically when I tried to shift.  This got worse until the gear would not work right.  Finally I gave up and dumped the car as soon as my loan balance would allow.

Maybe I got a lemon.  But I wanted to like that car.  It didn't work out.  On the plus side, you can't beat the gas mileage.  It is nice to travel 400 miles on 10 gallons of gas.  At first the shifting was smooth, and sure.  I always knew that the gear was in by the feedback in the stick.  For a small car it had plenty of cargo room, the same as the Sentra that I have now.  There was only one tire I could put on the car due to its small size (no choice, only one manufacturer), and it was all-season.  Good for Pennsylvania winters and summers.  The car had a VERY tight turning radius, and U-turns were very simple.  However, the car was very light and could not handle emergency steering very well.  I had a few close calls on wet streets due to the small tires and light car (no accidents though).

Maintenance was very cheap for this car.  Oil changes of course, but brakes lasted forever, tires were changed once, nothing in the engine gave me any problems.  The ride was stiff and loud, but I expected that in a small car.  If I were to buy a car simply to get around to work or local driving, I would consider this car and a Hyundai Accent.  Personally I would only consider this car because I had such a good experience with the Suzuki Swift, but I would be hyper-critical before buying one, including the service department.<br><br>
