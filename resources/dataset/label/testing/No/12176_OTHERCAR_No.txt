            I have been trying a colleague's Lexus and have to say that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this car.

The build quality is exceptional, it feels solid, the ride is fine and it handles well. The engine is smooth and responsive - fuel consumption (says my friend) is very good.

The trunk is spacious - larger than some NY appartments!

The stereo is sharp and all the goodies are there, Japanese science and technology at its best.

So what's wrong? IT IS BORING!!! It lacks any soul. Just like Al Gore, extremely capable, more capable than the competition, check marks against all the good points...but oh so boring.

There are a couple of areas where the Lexus epitomizes Gorism. Areas where, in theory, when you look at the specification, it should excel. Instead you are left feeling flat and lifeless. Descartes summed it up well. The difference between man and machine is that man has a soul. I take it further, a machine blessed with soul is an extension of man. The Lexus is a simple extension of a lifeless Toyota.

This lack of soul means that the Lexus is no more than a pale imitation of a Mercedes or BMW. The cars, despite their Teutonic roots, display boatloads of character. In truth what we have, and what no amounts of leather can disguise...is a cheap Toyota with a price tag that is not worth the upgrade.

What I noticed first was the difference in the quality of leather in the Lexus. At first sight it looks good, smells right and feels comfortable to sit on. But when you rub your hands over these seats you can feel the difference in comparison to Jaguar or Mercedes.

Driving the car is fine around town - superbly comfortable, quiet ride and performance is pretty good. It is only when you take this car around lanes that you notice that while it handles well it just does not inspire you. The same route with a BMW 5 series raises your spirits. You feel exhilarated. The Lexus left me feeling, well...I just don't know. It was not bad, it was far from bad...it was just...fine. But, if I want fine I buy a Toyota. If I want good I buy a BMW..not a Toyota with leather and an upgraded stereo.

As if to confirm my misgivings, a final tour of inspection of the car revealed that Lexus have done a good job of imitating Mercedes. The doors clunk like a Merc - the rear end even looks like a Merc and with imitation being the sincerest form of flattery...then why not buy a Merc.

If you buy one then you will not be let down. Reliable, extremely capable and with low depreciation...financially not an issue. It is just that its a bit like British Food. It sustains, you won't die but you know what...some people have Rice and some people have Risotto.
