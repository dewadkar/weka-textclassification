            I bought the Vivitar 3315 for $98.62 at Wal-mart. I have since returned it and replaced it for with the Vivitar 2.1 MP 3625 for $132.73. The picture quality was too blurry from the 3315 - even when using a Tripod from 29 inches away. Turns out the focus range starts at 48 inches - FOUR FEET!. Not acceptable for taking pictures of LPs on eBay, or pretty much any smaller object. In comparison, the 3625's focus range starts at 27 inches, and it even has a macro mode which starts at 12 inches.

Like the other users, I tried a number of AC adapters which fit the specs and none of them worked (unfortunately this is true of the 3625). I have since started using rechargeable batteries.

I was upgrading from a .3 megapixel RCA CDS1000, and let me say the quality of the pictures from the 3315 at 29" were only slightly better. One feature that was lost in the upgrade was the ability to use the camera a Twain device. I didn't realize newer cameras all have changed over to USB storage devices and you could no longer take a picture from pressing a button on the software. I originally though that was the reason for the 3315's blurriness, perhaps the camera was shaking slightly when I pressed the shutter button. So I tried the 10 second timer, but got the same results. Only after upgrading to the 3625 have I been able to take clear pictures (and I don't need to use the timer).

Some other comparisons to the 3625-

-The 3315 lens is unprotected, 3625 has a lens cover.

-All of the controls for the 3315 are digital, the 3625 has a manual dial to change between playback, record, movie and setup modes, a selection button - right left up down with OK in the middle, and manual switch for macro and standard.

-With the sounds off the 3315 is totally silent when taking a picture, the 3625 makes a soft click when it starts and completes taking a picture.

-I did like the 3315's sturdier case over the the 3625's flimsy one. Although a case is of little use to me since I keep the tripod adapter attached all the time.
