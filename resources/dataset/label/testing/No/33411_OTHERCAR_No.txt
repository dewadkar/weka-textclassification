            I had to drive from Indianapolis to Chicago to get my 1999 Jetta GLX - they were in short supply.  I didn't bother trying to haggle with the dealer, since there were several other people who would gladly have paid sticker for the car if I'd walked.  Like many others, I was drawn to the Jetta by the slick ads I'd seen in the New Yorker Magazine and other publications.  I'd even briefly owned a 1997 Jetta that I'd been very pleased with for the three months I'd had it.

I should have known I was in for a rough ride when, less than five miles from the dealership on my way back to Indianapolis, I reached up and slid back the sunroof cover, which moved about six inches, made a grinding sound, and then locked in place.  I headed back to the dealer, who informed me that the clips that hold up the sunroof cover were defective, but that I would have to have the problem fixed in Indianapolis, since they didn't have any new clips in stock.  So began my ordeal with this car, which I hope to ditch next week in favor of a 1997 BMW (which I probably should have bought in the first place).

After the sunroof cover was repaired free of charge back in Indianapolis, I had about 23,000 trouble-free miles.  Then I noticed that a piece of interior trim was coming down above one of the rear doors.  Since I was almost to 24,000 miles, when the pitifully short warranty was to expire, I immediately took the car to a dealer in Indianapolis.  I was informed that trim was only covered for 12,000 miles.  The dealer actually gave me a can of adhesive, but they wouldn't stick the trim back up for me.  No wonder, since I never did get it to stick right myself.  I eventually just took it down and threw it away.

Next, the tires wore out.  This happened at about 40,000 miles, while I was living in Boston (those heated seats were nice during the winter!).  Even though the tires wore out 10,000 miles early, the tire store I went to refused to honor the warranty unless I could produce records showing that I'd had the tires rotated regularly.  Since I couldn't, I was out another $300 for new front tires.  The rear tires wore out shortly thereafter, and cost another $250 to replace.

Next, the driver's door window broke.  I'm told this is a common problem, and I'm going to see if VW will reimburse me for the cost of having the window repaired.  When they did the repair they messed up the seal on the door, and the car leaked for several months until I had it re-sealed (at my cost) after I moved back to Indiana.

The sunroof cover broke again at 55,000 miles.  The dealer wanted $1,000 to install about $10 worth of clips, so I told them to just rip the cover out and throw it away.  Now if the sun is directly overhead I get a nice tan on my head.

At about 50,000 miles the mass air flow meter went out.  This was a $350 repair.

At 65,000 miles the whole panel on the driver's door where the window switches, etc. are started to come loose.  Now if I don't close the door carefully the whole panel lifts up and acts as if it could break loose.  I ordered some clips (about $12) to hold the panel down, but haven't had them installed yet (the dealer offered to install them for free).  Also, the window switches have intermittent failures now, as do the door locks when activated with the key (the remote still works fine).

The driver's side seat memory stopped working at about 68,000 miles.  Now at 72,000 miles the power controls on the driver's side seat occasionally fail as well.

I have a morbid curiosity to see what will go wrong with this car next, but after experiencing all of the above, I just can't put up with anything else.  The BMW dealer told me today that my car is only worth $8,000 in trade.  This is a car that cost almost $25,000 new, less than four years ago.  Apparently word has gotten out about the quality of these cars.  Still, after all the problems I feel fortunate that anyone is willing to assume responsibility for this car at any price.

When I was considering purchasing the Jetta, I read a review that said that it was as nice as a BMW 3 series for $10,000 less. After driving a 1997 BMW 740il today, I can positively say that the reviewer had no idea what he or she was talking about.  Although the Jetta offers a fairly solid ride, it's nowhere near the quality of a BMW.  If you have the extra money to spend, buy the Bimmer.  If not, stay away from the Jetta anyway - it's definitely not worth the headaches.
