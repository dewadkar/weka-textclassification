            Good camera with a bad habit of gorging battery life. An ugly situation. Either you Love it or you hate it. I have mixed feelings for it though.
 Good quality pictures. Very small, it can fit in your pocket. Great for on the go. As small or smaller than disposable 35mm camera. 
 Depending on battery brand. Batteries can last you from 8 to 25 pictures with the LCD display on. You need lots of AA rechargeables. Don't buy the dock. I got a wall adaptor at radioshack with a special tip to fit it into the DC or AC plug. HP doesn't offer one for it. That helps a lot when you are home and don't need to use batteries. It uses 2 AA.
 It has a cool sound with picture feature that allows you to record pictures with a 5 second sound clip.
 What I don't understand is why it has such a hard time focusing. My girlfriend totally lost hope of ever liking this camera because of this. I payed for it so I'm forced to find a way to like. It is horrible at close up shots. You need to be at least a couple of feet away from something for it to allow you to take the shot. It says "focus too close". It's supposed to be Macro shot not an aereal view.
 When something is a little far and I mean a little as in the same room, it will say "focus too far" and will not let you take the picture. Sometimes it just says "unable to focus".  It gets REALLY REALLY ANNOYING. You can easily miss something because camera won't focus.
 It is good however in moving and landscape shots like from the inside of a moving car. It can do good far away shots this way or far scenery.
 I say if you are serious about getting a good digital camera that won't let you down (beginners or advanced digital imagers) then AVOID this camera. However it is good to have as a second camera that you can take with you outside of the home on trips and stuff. Just remember to take LOTS of extra batteries.
