            We bought our Volvo V-70 Wagon 2 years ago, mostly for its reputation for safety and reliability. Although our car has not disappointed us from those two aspects, we would not recommend it for people looking for a spacious vehicle.  Whenever we go on a trip longer than a day, trying to pack the car becomes very cumbersome.  With two kids in rear car seats, this makes very little room for anything else. The cargo area is small in comparison to other family vehicles like a mini-van or SUV.

The other issues we had with the Volvo was that it handles poorly in inclement weather.  We live if Maine and we get frequent snow and ice storms.  The Volvo V-70 is only a front wheel drive wagon and as such does not perform like other comparable front wheel drive wagons.  We asked our friend that own other wagons and they usually say that they handle pretty well in bad weather.  Volvo does however make an all-wheel drive wagon similar to the V-70, which in hindsight, would have been a better choice for the weather condition of northern New England.

Some of the features of the V-70 include decent fuel consumption for a wagon. It gets approximately 25 mpg on the highway.  A nice addition is the heated car seats that really make it pleasant in the cold weather.  Another feature in this Volvo, is the child safety locks that are already attached to the seatbelts.

Although it has not experienced  significant mechanical failures, it has been an expensive car to maintain due to the higher cost of routine maintenance.

Therefore, I would not recommend this car for a family of 4 or more.  If you were to get a Volvo wagon, get the all wheel drive model. 

<b> This is a opinion of a friend of mine that was staying at my house this weekend.  He did not want to open his own account, but offered his opinion on the Volvo to me.</b>
