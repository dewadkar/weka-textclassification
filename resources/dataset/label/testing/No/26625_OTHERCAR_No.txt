            I had just started a new job (I'm in Sales) and I need a car that would be reliable and something I could feel good about owning.  My first new car was a 1994 Chevy Cavalier, which I never regretted buying because of both it's appearance and performance.  I wanted to do the same with this car.  My wife's family swears by Honda and I have always been impressed when I see older Hondas that still look sharp and not outdated.  Honda also has a good reputation for durability.  

We originally were looking at Honda Civic to fit in with my newlywed, new job budget.  However, they were trying to unload the 2002 Accords to get the 2003's in (read: excuse to tell you that you are getting a good price on the car) so we went with the Accord.  The reason that we chose the Special Edition was because my wife really liked the model.  It is a sharp looking car.  We got the black coupe, without the "flap" (spoiler).  I am proud to own it from that standpoint.  And we did get a good deal.  The Special Edition gives you: Aluminum Rims, AM/FM Cassette/CD stereo w/ 6 speakers, adjustable seats(raise and lower), moon roof and cruise control.

Performance has given me mixed feelings.  I do drive the car alot (14,000 miles in 6 months).  It doesn't have alot of power.  Take off speed is often slow, especially if the car hasn't had a chance to warm up.  Going up hills is a big concern for me because I live in a hilly town.  I got stuck on my first hill here in the winter.  I started from a dead stop on an upgrade and barely made it up.  I never had any problems like that before.  I never thought I was getting a race car, but I expected a little more than that.

The windows fog at every given opportunity as well.  What is even more strange is using the air conditioner over the heater gets rid of it quicker.  

The stereo is top notch.  I was ready to replace it right off the bat, but it can be loud if you need it loud and the sound is good with the six speaker system.

Another good feature is the inability to lock your keys in the car.  If the keys are in the ignition, and you hit lock on the car either by manually pressing the lock stick down or the all lock button, and you shut the door, it will automatically unlock.

Overall the car is nice, but I think I paid too much for it, even at 18,000.  The real test will be after I have hit 100,000 miles and what the car looks like then.
