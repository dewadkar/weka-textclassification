            I used to own a 1989 Honda Civic which I bought used during my College days. The complaints I had about that car were the weak suspension components and frequent brake and steering problems. But the Engine was very smooth and never gave me any problems. After I got a job, I bought a new Honda Accord LX 4 Cyl. I thought, Honda had 12 years to get rid of those problems I mentioned above. I guess 12 years was not enough.
The Problems:
The first problem I noticed was at around 100 miles. The steering kept pulling the car to the right. I have rented many other cars and they dont have this problem. Took it to the dealer and he said it was fine and it was all in my head. The fact is that Honda Accord will only drive straight if the road is 100% flat with 0% bumps. Even the slight rumble or slope will start pulling your car to one side (more to the right in my case) So, The Accord has an over sensitive steering which you dont want to have if you go on long drives.
The second problem I noticed was that high speeds (around 70MPH) when I try to slow down, the brakes rumble slightly. The dealer as usual said it was all in my head. Fact is that at 30000 miles, I had to get the rotors replaced and that was not even covered under warranty. All because that same rumble grew more and more. Cost around $300.
The third problem is with the suspension. When new, I used to hear a slight thumping sound from the front left whenever I went over a speed bump. The dealer... you guessed right, its all in my head. Well, that thumping noise is way loud now and the dealer again says that its not covered under warranty. I have not bothered getting that fixed, I guess I'll live with the thumps and bangs and knocks of this terribly built car.
But the MOST serious problem with this car, due to which I'm planning to trade it in and buy a non-honda car, is:
The engine EATS OIL! My 1989 ate maybe an ounce of oil every 3000 miles. This brand new Accord eats a Quart of oil every 2500 miles. FYI, a quart is enough to bring the oil to the bottom line of the dipstick. Even a 1985 hyundai excel can do better than this. AND THE WORST part is that Honda told me that it is normal to burn a quart of oil EVERY 1000 Miles!!!!! I wonder why the dealer never told me this fact while I was test driving this car. So, as you guessed it, its not covered under warranty. 

So think and ask this question before you buy:
"Do I want to buy a Honda when Honda says that its normal to burn 1 Quart of Oil every 1000 Miles"?
I think Honda has terrible customer service and they DONT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AT ALL. I have a feeling that they discourage their dealers from fixing under-warranty problems.
So whether you are buying a 2001, 2002, 2003 or later Honda, just be-aware of all these problems. Maybe in the next 20 years or so they might get their act together. Until then, they plan to sell their cars on pure HYPE! Honda Makes crappy cars and their quality has gone down the drain.
