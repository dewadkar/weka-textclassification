This camera is a great deal.  Wal-Mart has them for 175$ right now, but they are going fast.  If you absolutely must have a digital camera buy this one.  Its very easy to use and has a sleek slim style that fits easily in the pocket. The interface is very simple and most people will not need to read the instructions for simple features.  But,...

We were unable to decent looking photos out of it.  90 percent of the photos come out blurry or double exposed.  I tried bracing, but only if the subject and the photographer completely freeze do you get a somewhat clear picture.  I tries printing on a number of mediums including a Textronics wax transfer printer and could not get a single good looking picture out the first 75.

It also eats batteries like a 25 dollar cellphone.  Luckily, it comes with rechargable batteries or that would cost a fortune.  

Also, it comes with a serial cable which makes it extremely slow to transfer to your PC.  If you have I would recommend a usb card reader if you plan to do any uploading.

All in all, if you absolutely must have a digital camera, buy this one because as I said it is very inexpensive.  If you can afford more, though, spend the extra money for a different model because you will do it sooner or later anyway.  I intend to research other Fuji cameras with a purchase in mind. I just would not recommend this model.  The lack of decent quality pictures is ultimately a show stopper.  I was forced to return it.
