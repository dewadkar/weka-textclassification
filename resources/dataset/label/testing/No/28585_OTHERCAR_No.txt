            Okay folks, here it is. Today is May 2nd 2000. Last Wednesday I bought myself a brand new Jeep Wrangler Sport. I traded in a perfect 1994 Jeep Wrangler because the miles were creeping over 132,000. I though it was time to buy new, I thought I would blow a transmission or start dumping money into it every month. Kind of ironic how things turn out. Bought the new Jeep and had it in my possession a full 34 hours. Guess what happened....thats right...The transmission went out on me. Let me say that again for those of you who might want clarification. Traded in a good Jeep because I had 132,000 miles on the clock and thought the transmission would be going soon...Bought the new Jeep and the transmission went with less the 400 miles on it. I love Jeeps. I love old and new Jeeps but wanted to let those of you shopping for a new Jeep to do the research that I failed to do. I have always trusted the Jeep product. Still it is made by Chrysler and we all know what that means. Poor quality.
My research has turned up that the New Jeeps on the market have been &quot;improved&quot; with a new style of transmission. Well here is one example of how this new transmission has worked out. I will say that the customer service I received was excellent and my Jeep was repaired very quickly. Still, I am having difficulty with it. I am bringing the Jeep back into the shop later this week. The clutch is making noise and starting off in first gear feels like I am learning to drive a stick all over again. (been driving sticks for over 9 years). I am not a mechanic but I will tell you that although the Jeep is a wonderful ride to own it does not come with headaches. Just can't wait to see what happens next. If you want to reach me feel free.   <br><br>
