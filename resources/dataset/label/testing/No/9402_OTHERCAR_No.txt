            I will answer these questions.  #1 I bought the car because it looked great, had a lot of options, and my college buddies had vw's with millions of miles on them so I thought reliabitiy would still be high. Well, it has been in the dealer for 2 solid months now and absolutly no answer from the dealer.  I guess the bright spot is is that I now have an extremely low milage car.  They did give me a truck of all things for me to drive in the meantime.  I have had the ck engine light on since I bought it last Sept. and now it's June 1!  Most of the problems really are from the dealer but they are a reflection of vw.  VW trains these guys to deal with customers and any problems but I think they need a little more training! 
#2 I don't remember what is like to drive it. I think I do remember it was nice (only when it ran good and no warning light on the dash)but I'm really not sure.
#3 Maybe someone but, no one I like.  Like I said, most of the problem stems from the dealer and this is the only dealer around here so for my area I would not recomend.  Unless they want to waste time with Ohio Arbritration, and then a lawyer.  By the way BOTH vw and the dealer were notified about me sueing them about a month ago.  They only have a week or two now to reply and if they don't, I automatically win the judgement by default!
