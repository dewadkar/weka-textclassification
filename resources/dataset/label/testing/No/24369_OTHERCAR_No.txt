            I love this camera, it is small enough to carry in your pocket wherever you go, no big bag to haul around, the interface with the Picture Gear software isn't the greatest but with the addition of the floppy adapter for the memory stick it is very simple to get your images onto your PC.   I like the memory stick format, I have the 32 meg stick but the batteries usually runs out long before I fill it unless I am making lots of movies.  I would like the movies to record a little longer but 15 seconds can usually catch whatever you were looking to catch... if you need movies, get a camcorder. My only complaint is Sony's lack of support... they seem to offer no accessories for this camera having forsaken it completely in favor of the F505 and the Mavicas.  Sony! support this model and I will buy every single accessory you develop!!<br><br>
