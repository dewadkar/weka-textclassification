            The 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab first appealed to me because of the rear seat access and updated styling. I purchased a barely used 4x4 example with the 5.9L gas V-8, automatic, and SLT option package from the local Dodge dealer.  The truck had slightly less than 10,000 miles when I acquired it.  Unfortunately, when you live with your truck a few months the deficiencies that were not apparent on the initial test drive begin to show.
Economy and Performance:
Although this is not a prime factor when purchasing a pickup, it must be considered in the overall cost of ownership.  I've had four extended cab half ton trucks, and one extended cab 3/4 ton.  All got better mileage in town than this one gets on the interstate.
My daily commute in easy driving, at 35-50 mph, yields a 6 month average of 10.9 miles per gallon.  Point to point on the highway at 65 mph consistently comes in at under 15.  On the vast prairie interstate, crusing between 75 and 80, the mileage drops down to an intolerable 11.9!  

In addition, the engine doesn't have enough power at 2000 rpm to maintain a cruise control speed without excessive downshifting of the automatic transmission.  It is embarassing to have such a brawny brute of a truck that struggles up anything resembling a serious grade.
Off the line performance is acceptable, but only marginally so.  I knew this truck didn't feel as quick as the one I traded in (a '99 Silverado 5.3 litre with 3.73:1 rear end ratio), my too late research shows that a 5.3L Chevy smokes it by about 1.5 seconds to 60 mph.  

Braking is acceptable, but four wheel anti-lock being considered an option is absurd in these days of high technology vehicles.  The salesman at the Dodge dealer assured me it had anti-lock brakes.  He was correct, it has REAR wheel anti-lock brakes.  Unfortunately it was not equipped with the optional four wheel ABS.  My mistake for not being more careful.  I would recommend increasing following distances in traffic.  On a rain slick road a new Saturn wagon in front of me made a panic stop to avoid a car that rolled through a red light.  I saw the offending car (because of the Dodge's high seating position) and was on the brakes as soon as the Saturn.  It was an odd sensation to watch the distance beween the Dodge and the Saturn get smaller as we both ground to a stop.  OK, it was worse that odd, it was a little bit scary.

The stock 17" tires are smooth and quiet, but have very little resistance to side slippage on snow.  Once you get the back end of the truck coming around, you can let off the gas but it doesn't straigthen out, it just keeps trying to switch directions on you.  The same effect is noticeable in the excessive understeer on slippery surfaces when you are not applying throttle.  The tires have very little desire to not slide sideways.  Last snow season, non-studded snow tires (like Blizzaks) were not yet available for the 17" Dodge wheels.  Maybe next year.  

Interior and comfort:
Oh boy, wait until you find the odd blind spot caused by the A-pillar.  I'm an average 5'10" guy, my wife is a 5' even.  We both have noticed a front visibility blind spot.  This becomes most apparent when on a road approach, with the front end of the truck pointed slightly upward.  As you turn right and try to see where you are going you can completely lose sight of the highway.  Very disconcerting on secondary roads, especially at night.

The seats are surprisingly fine.  The upholestry material seems a little cheap, and you have to be careful not to fold anything (like the seatbelts) into the rear seat or you leave a permanent impression in the fabric.  The seat cushions are a nice density, and the lumbar support works well.  Articulated headrests would sure be nice.  

Ergonomics of the switches and controls is very standard Detroit, everything is where you expect, easy to see and operate.  I am not a big fan of steering wheel mounted cruiese control buttons, but everyone except General Motors seems to think this is a good idea.  If the controls have to be there, they should be illuminated at night.  

Quality
If you really look at the taillights, they look terribly cheap.  The cup holder failed at 11,000 miles, and I'm afraid it may need replaced every year.  Other satisfied warranty claims include the fuel tank sending unit, loose and rattling front fender (where was the quality control?), and non-functioning power outlets.  There is an awful lot of wind noise in crosswinds over 20 mph.  However, the truck is relatively squeak and rattle free, now that the fender is bolted on.

The rest of the good and the bad in no particular order
Unbelievably heavy tailgate.
Cool white gauges, but not that new of a feature anymore.
Nicely power window and lock controls on the door.
Very useful (optional) fold out load floor in the rear of the cab.
Factory Mopar bedliner has detiorated and cracked in the corners after less than a year.
The dealer cannot get the alignment on this truck set so that it will not head to the right hand ditch.  Straight ahead stability is awful, you constantly have to apply enough pressure on the wheel to keep it about about 10 degrees left of center.  This is no fun on an extended interstate trip.
I still cannot believe how much fuel this thing uses.
