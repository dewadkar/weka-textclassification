            I own a black 1999 4.6 HSE Range Rover, Land Rover.  I bought it for tax purposes.  I am a sports car kind of guy so naturally I wouldn't be interested in SUVs. This is the only one that I would buy and did buy.  I don't drive it much, but when I do, it's like driving a tank on a pillow of air.  You feel the weight of it and the speed isn't really there.  I love the look of the thing and love the fact that you can lift the car up by simply pushing a button to clear obstacles that may be in your path. It is a gas guzzler as well. I think it may do about 12-19 Miles Per Gallon.  The insurance isn't a treat either.  I knew what I was getting into from the start. This car is truly high maintenance.  If you can afford it, go for it. If not, don't.  <br><br>
