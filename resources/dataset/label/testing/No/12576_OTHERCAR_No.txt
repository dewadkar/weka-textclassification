<TEXT>
            I have a 96 Integra LS Coupe that currently had 80k miles on the odometer.  While not your typical Integra owner (at the time, a 35 year old husband and father of two children), it was a purchase I made for myself, instead of getting something smart, like an Accord.

The car has been great, and typical of Honda, has never visited a dealer.  I've changed the oil every 3000 miles, changed air/fuel filters occasionally, changed spark plugs and flushed the radiator twice, and it keeps going.  Nothing leaks or has ever gone wrong mechanically.  It's an appliance, albeit one that is very happy cruising at 90+ when you can find wide open spaces.  

The only negatives are the utility factor, having to put people in the back seat (even if they are small kids, they still get tripped up by the front seatbelts), and the fact the nose is dinged up by road gravel.  If I had it to do it over, I would have bought a bra for it.  Additionally, if I knew then what I knew now, I'd have opted for the V-Tec.  The regular engine is more than sufficient, but the V-Tec could only be more exciting.<br><br>
