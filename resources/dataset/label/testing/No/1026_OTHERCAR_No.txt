            I loved my 1998 Dodge Intrepid until 5/4/01.  That was a day I will never forget!  My 7 year old son got in the car about 1 minute before I did.  For some reason he decided to pull the gear shift.  There was NO KEY in the car so if should NOT have came out of gear.  Guess what....it did and it started rolling backwards.  I was 6 months pregnant at the time but my child was in a rolling car headed for a drop off in a creek.  I ran after the car, tried to jump in it and got drug down by the door and dragged across a asphalt parking lot about 25 feet.  I was knocked out for a second only to wake up and see my 7 year old jumping from the car into a ditch.  I was hurt really bad but managed to get up to see about my son.  He was fine but I was not.  I was taken to the hospital where my unborn child was monitored and I was bandaged.  I had road rash all over my right shoulder and arm and my hip felt as if it was broken.  It was not but I had severe injuries to it.  

My 1998 Dodge Intrepid had 26000 miles on it at the time.  Dodge sent an inspector to look at it and he said it was "definitely defective" as it should have a locking mechanism to lock the shifter when there is no key in the ignition.  He could plainly see it come out of gear and he said I should be hearing from Dodge immediately and he felt sure they would fix it and pay for my hospital visit and the damage to my door (it bent backwards as it pulled me and it sprung the door and dented it.  Ended up having to have it replaced).  

Guess What?  Dodge denied that it was defective and told me I should have had my parking brake on.  I WAS ON FLAT GROUND! There was no reason in this world to put it on. They would not cover the claim and they would not fix the car.  We finally went to where we bought the car and they contacted Dodge about the problem and we ended up not paying for the part but we did have to pay the labor charges!  And, there was about $2500 damage to my car which my insurance had to end up paying and now my insurance has gone up due to this!  

I WILL NEVER EVER OWN ANOTHER DODGE OR CHRYSLER PRODUCT!  I would have been a happy camper if Dodge would have paid out the measly costs I encountered and I would have continued to be a Dodge person.  Not now....and I will let everyone I know and everyone I don't know how they treat their customers.
