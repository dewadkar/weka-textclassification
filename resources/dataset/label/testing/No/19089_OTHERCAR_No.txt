* Reason For Purchase
 Actually this car belongs to my Mom but I drive it almost everyday since I don't have my car yet and I still lived with her so I see the car everyday! Well, our reason for purchasing or actually leasing this vehicle was because at the time my parents were getting divorced and my Mom needed a car since we only had one and my Mom needed something practical,useful,&quot;cute&quot;, and most importantly CHEAP! So as we were driving around in our OLD car she kept seeing Kia's and kept asking me and I quote &quot;What's that? Its CUTE!!!!&quot; and I kept saying its a Kia and so we ended up at our local dealership for a test drive.

* Best Things About Vehicle

Well, my favorite things about this little SUV are for one its looks ill admit its a very cute little car and my moms has a pushbar and it looks all mean in the front and then this little cute SUV behind it! Secondly its VERY USEFUL! We have put so much stuff in this thing like 400lbs of sand,12 suitcases,8 kids,4 dogs all kinds of stuff not all at the same time but still that's a lot of space! And for an SUV i can make this thing FLY around corners it does have a lot of body roll BUT it NEVER threatens to flip or roll over. In snow or off road this little thing is wonderful it plows through 3 feet of snow like its nothing and in gravel no slipping at all! EVER ON ICE! Its sure-footed! Definitely a useful SUV!

* Worst Things About Vehicle

Fuel Efficiency! This thing is not good on gas! For a 2.0 liter 4 cyl this thing guzzles gas like a V8! I would say we get at best 10MPG it hasn't always been this way this its been this way its a recent development (past 4 months). It has been to the dealership about this several times and they could find nothing! Also the reliability on this car is not up to par! This is not a reliable car! If you buy one buy 2 one for you to use and the other to keep in the shop! I think the last thing I don't like about this car would be The sluggishness in the steering when in 4wd now for me its no problem I am strong enough to deal with it but my Mom has trouble with it. At high speed its no problem but at parking lot speed(10 mph or below) its VERY STIFF almost impossible to make turns!

* Necessary Repairs

We have now owned this car for 3 years and we have had numerous problems, So many that I don't remember all of them but I will list as many as possible. Well, the first day we bought the car the check engine light came on and we took it to the dealership and it turned out to be a faulty EGR (Exhaust Gas Return) valve which was replaced free of charge. This same problem as happened about 9 times since then and always done free of charge. Also one day in 4wd the front drive shaft fell onto the ground! I mean fell off of the car NO LONG ATTACHED IN ANY WAY! Then we had to have the clutch adjusted because it was slipping. After that came numerous electrical problems. Then it turned out we had to have the clutch replaced!
Then there was a coolant leak around the thermostat. After that came the most dangerous problem. Stalling while driving this problem almost got me killed twice once I was on the highway at 70mph and it stalled just as I was coming up on road construction and I was without powered braking to I ran off of the road and managed to stop by going to 1st gear and releasing the clutch and using the emergency brake! Then it stalled in a curve and I fell down a 12 foot embankment and got severe whiplash and a concussion! And as a result the next day the alternator belt broke and I was stranded because I had no power for fuel injectors! Now our only problem is the rear tire carrier is rattling!

* Driving Experience

I have to say this car is fun all-around  to drive on and off road. I love driving on road more because I can fling it into and out of curves and never have it threaten to roll! It is a blast to drive if you don't mind the body roll and its also a blast off road like in snow because where I live there are open fields to just blast through in the snow! Definitely fun to drive!

* Who Should Purchase

I would say this car is good for college students and anyone on a tight budget. I am sure the newer models have improved and IM sure they are more reliable. In 1997 this car hadn't been on the market long and all the bugs weren't worked out. IM sure this car is much better now! Just check around Epinions for more advice on this car and do your research and make an informed decision,, I wish we had!<br><br>
