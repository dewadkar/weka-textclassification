            I should have known better to buy a Mitsubishi, but I've only ever owned Hondas and was looking for something different.  Different is exactly what I got.

Let me first state that I am meticulous about preventive maintence and have followed the Mitsubishi recommended maintence schedule to a T.

While under warranty the first 36,000 miles were plagued by piddly issues like the seat not adjusting properly, the electric rear view mirrors not working and the security system going off unexpectedly.  I promptly alerted the dealer of these issues as they surfaced and they were repaired in a day while I had free use of a rental car.  Fair enough.    No dealer has ever found the root of the security system and I continue to deal with it today.  I also noticed a number of other issues that I alerted the dealer of, in particular a whine from the belts and a slight slip in the transmission between first and second gears.  

After repeating the issues every time I was in for maintence, at about 62,000 I finally found a dealer that identified the issues.. 2,000 miles out of the powertrain warranty, and I was asked to pay for the repairs.  The belt whine stemmed from a bent bracket that held one of the pullys for a belt, and though the dealer agreed with me that it would have to have been bent at the time of assembly he still requested that I pay.  I'd had it up to 'here' and contacted the Regional Sales Manager who agreed not to charge me, and also noticed several recalls on the car that I hadn't had repaired (I've not ever been notified of any needed work to date.) and he took care of that work as well.  One of the recalls involved the transmission.  Apparently because of poor design they were accomodating with a retrofit.  I thought my issues were handled well (ie. curteous and FREE though not without extream assertiveness) and was on my way.

At about 90,000 miles I noticed that I was burning oil, slightly more than was considered normal for Mitsu, and was told that I needed engine repair.  To make a very long story short, my engine was ripped completely apart 3 different times by two different dealers.  The first two times in Indiana, where after an entire month of unreturned phone calls, and ill repairs the service manager assured me that the issues were finally solved and wrote a letter stating that the dealership would be "responsible for any and all costs associated with engine repair related to either misdiagnosis or incomplete work."  Another dealer in another state, another engine rebuild, a water pump (the likely issue in the first place), a cussing session between the dealers, and two additional months without the use of my car later, I was repaired.  No compensation for rental, but no additional fees.

A continual issue with this car, and probably my greatest gripe is with the brakes.  I'm a cautious driver, not heavy on the brakes, rarely have I needed to brake quicky, etc.. (you get the picture).  I am now on my 7th set of rotors each having been turned the requisite 3 times, I have recently needed a 3rd set of calypers.  The drums have had repeated issues, and I can't count the number of times that I've heard the words "bleed the lines."  As I wright this my car is again at the dealer with break issues.  He mumbled something about rods.. I told him to go check again.  So again I wait to see how many more hundred dollars it will cost me to keep this car on the road.

Additional random costs:  the wiper fluid tank developed a leak and needed replaced, the horn quit working, one of the fog lights just fell off the car, repeated bulb replacement for the head/tail/turn lights, the key lock on the trunk seized, and the cloth on the door panels flap in the wind.

Did I mention that it costs as much to insure my 1997 Galant as it does for my husband to insure his 1999 Suburban? (Neither of us have any driving infractions ever.)  I could go on by I think you've heard enough.  

All I can think about is my old Honda.  A standard Civic 5-speed that I drove for 176,000 miles needing only break pads, one turn of the rotors, and a starter.
