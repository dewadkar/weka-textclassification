            I have read all the positive reviews on the Chevy Metro so I thought I would ad my experience with them.  My Metro was a 94 and it was possibly the worst car that I ever owned.  I had numerous problems ranging from the AC going out to oil leaks.  After 2 years and 45,000 miles the engine blew which would have been a 2,000 dollar repair had i not scrapped it.  Very dissapointing.  The car's engine was also sorely lacking any power.  I could not pull out into traffic, especially when the AC was turned on.  The car was also extremely small making it dangerous in wet or snowy road conditions.  In medium to high winds the car was very hard to control and keep on the road.  There were however some good things about the car.  First of all was the price.  When I was in college, a brand new car for 9,000 dollars was perfect.  It also has absolutely incredible gas mileage. A full tank cost me 10 dollars and lasted for 2 weeks.  I easily got 45 miles per gallon highway. The good side of having a small compact car is that paralel parking in the city was a snap.  Overall, the car is good for high school or college kids or for people who live/work in a busy city and do not do a lot of traveling.  I would not reccomend this car if you actually spend a lot of time driving.   <br><br>
