            The car with the most disasterous sales in Honda was the Civic wagon, termed &quot;wagovan&quot;.  This car was not only ugly but unstable and underpowered.  The CR-V follows suit nicely along those lines as it takes all those qualities and brings them up to date as a sport utility.  This car is a half effort at designing a car and shows a real lack of imagination.  Because of the Honda badge this car has sold well in the state of Washington.  When you look at the other competitors in the Grand Vitara, Rav 4 and Xterra they have all taken one quality and ran with it.  Honda has taken a Civic and raised the ground clearance 5 inches.  The Grand Vitara has power, the Rav 4, unique design, the Xterra has rugged recreational qualities.  

After driving this car (a friend of mine's) I was left begging for power rather than this tinny little electric sounding motor. No matter what trim level you purchase the car still looks the same...base!  I think that Honda would have done better to create a wagon on the Civic base and market it.

The CR-V is ugly, underpowered and just generally unimpressive.  However, the instrumentation is clear and easy to read, all controls are easy to operate and reach from the drivers seat.  Visibility for this car is to be commended as you do have a good view out every side.  The bottom line lies here:  If you enjoy driving and like cars, do not even waste your time driving this car.  If you look at a car as a tool to get you from point A to point B, you have found your car.<br><br>
