            Just a quick note to other consumers out there... I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas and we have only used it for one day.  First off, I am pleased with the software and ease of use -- it was a breeze to shoot and download through the USB port.

However, and this might just be us doing something wrong, but we only got 8 pictures out of the batteries it came with before they went dead.  We then installed Energizer Alkalines and left the LCD display off.  This time we got 12 pictures before the batteries were drained.

At the price per batt/picture it seems cheaper to use 35mm film.  The other anomaly we ran into is that all of the pictures are dark and a little green.  This is fixable easy enough using the software it comes with -- but each picture needs to be modified the same way -- every time.

The darkness problem might be something we are doing wrong, but I sure don't see how other folks are getting 100 pictures out of a set of batteries.  We plan on returning the camera tomorrow and researching for a better alternative.  

We were shooting relatively high quality so maybe that is harder on the batteries than if you shoot using the low quality -- I am too inexperienced to know if that could affect battery life or not.  <br><br>
