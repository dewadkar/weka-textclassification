            First off, if you are looking for a professional quality digital camera, you need not read any further. Go elsewhere because this product is not one of them. As the manufacturer SONY explains about the product, <b>DSC-P1</b> is <b>not designed for professional photography applications</b>. The letter 'P' in its model name stands for '<b>play</b>' or '<b>pocket</b>' according to SONY's very own product planner. If you want to read more about that and product background, here is the link: http://www.sonystyle.com/digitalimaging/p1story.htm

With that said, here is what an actual user, myself, has to say about DSC-P1's features, benefits, and all of its dirty details.
The camera features <b>3.34 megapixel CCD</b> with resolution from <b>640x480</b> up to <b>2048x1536</b>. Such high resolution actually can compensate for one of the camera's own cons which I will get into later. Anyway, the benefit of having such high resolution is that <b>you don't need to get too close to an object in order to take a close-up shot</b>. You simply take a picture at higher resolution without getting too close to the object to prevent camera from going out of focus. Then in a photo-editing software (the camera is <b>bundled with a video editing and a photo editing software package</b>) you simply crop the picture to shape it the way you want it. Or if you are just taking a picture of some beautiful scenery, the higher resolution also helps. It is like <b>getting all your pictures developed at sizes larger than 5x7"</b>!
This brings up my next issue with the camera: <b>bundled 8MB memory stick</b>. I am throughly disappointed at SONY for not including a memory stick with larger capacity. Higher picture quality means more memory usage per picture. And included 8MB memory stick really is <b>not appropriate for any practical application</b> of the camera. I am currently using a 128MB memory stick and take most of my pictures at 1600x1200. With 8MB memory stick, I can only take no more that several pictures at such resolution. So if you are genuinely interested in this camera, <b>be prepared to spend another $100 or so for a larger capacity memory stick</b> (I would say you need <b>at least 64MB to take decent amount of pictures without having to run to your computer</b> to dump the cache).
Now for some fun tools that the camera provides: special effects and A/V application. When I say 'special effects,' please don't get too excited. They are no more than simple filters to change the feel of pictures. DSC-P1 has '<b>b & w</b>' effect for taking <b>b/w pictures</b>, '<b>sepia</b>' for giving pictures '<b>aged</b>' look of <b>brown overtone</b>, '<b>solarize</b>' for giving uh...solarized look, and '<b>neg. art</b>' to make pictures show as they would on actual film. I find most of these effects <b>not very useful</b> when it comes down to actual picture taking. They are mostly just for fun. If you are at the level of tweaking pictures using filters found on high-end software tools such as Photoshop and CorelDraw, these on-board effects would not even come close. Besides, if you are already doing that, you should really be considering a professional grade camera, not this one. DSC-P1's <b>A/V capability</b> is strictly designed for <b>email purpose</b> or other <b>basic video application</b>. After all, this is a digital 'still' camera, not a camcorder. DSC-P1 allows maximum of <b>15 sec. video recording</b> time per shot at 160x112, 320x240, or 320 (HQ). This is a nice feature to have when you are on vacation and faced with one of those moments that you want to capture but a still shot just won't cut it.

When I first started using this camera, I had a hard time with its <b>delayed response</b> in taking pictures. If you want to take a picture of a moving objects such as my cat for example, the task becomes quite tricky. Certainly, it is possible but you have to get used to the way DSC-P1 responds to your touch. Even then, I still wouldn't recommend using DSC-P1 to take such pictures. It just is not very reliable for such application.
Another problem I've encountered with the camera has to do with its <b>sluggish focusing capability with close objects</b>. For just taking close-up shots of things for normal display purpose, you can get away by deploying the alternative method I've mentioned earlier (when I was talking about the camera's high resolution). If you need to take a close-up shot of something at very high resolution, however, then you are in big trouble. It just won't focus.

Overall, the camera is very <b>compact</b>, pretty <b>easy to use</b> and navigating its menu structure is a breeze with its 4-way button. The camera does have some other basic features found in most compact automatic 35mm cameras such as <b>built-in flash</b>, <b>red-eye adjust</b>, <b>focus-lock</b>, <b>zoom</b>, etc. But DSC-P1 gives you a bit more <b>options</b> as far as adjusting <b>white balance</b>, <b>flash intensity</b>, <b>sharpness</b>, <b>exposure</b>. Hey after all, we are living in a digital era and this is a digital camera. I just <b>wish that the price wasn't so high and the mentioned problems didn't exist</b>.
