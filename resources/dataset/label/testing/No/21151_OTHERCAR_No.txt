            Initially I loved this camera. Handling is great, images terrific. The user interface is excellent. However, after several months of use I have found a few problems. First, close ups are not very good when I photograph watches, and even when I am careful to use a tripod and am within the macro range, the images are out of focus. It appears the best focus is behind the objects being photographed. Second, my camera housing under the lens and near the body has developed some very fine cracks. The camera has never been dropped and always carried in its hard case. Lastly, the camera is quite bulky to travel with if you want to pack it in a briefcase. <br><br>
