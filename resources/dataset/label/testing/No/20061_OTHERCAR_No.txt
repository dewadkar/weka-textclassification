            Bought a new Optio 550 for an Asian holiday.
Early Problems (first 2 days)
1 - The view finder does not correctly frame an object that is 4 to 6 feet away. Objects are higher in the photo then they appeared in the viewfinder. (I have checked 2 demo 550's, and they both had a similar problem, but less exaggerated. Had a service tech at the store check his results, and they were the same) note: The LCD does not have this issue.

2 - The camera locked up solid two times, when I try to take &#147interval shooting&#148 pictures, set to take 3 pictures 10 seconds apart. It would take the first photo, and stop. The camera would still be on, but you can do nothing with it. There is no menu action, it is just locked up. It will not take a new photo, zoom, or shut off with the power switch. If you remove, and reinstall the battery, the camera will shut down when the battery is reinstalled. It then restarts fine.
3 - After 1.5 weeks of 100 photos a day during my travel the zoom lens got louder and louder, then finally failed to close fully, locking about 1/2 inch extended. I lost 2 weeks of photo opportunities in China, as I couldn't get warranty repair in less then 4 weeks&#133 

When I returned to US, I sent the camera overnight to Pentax US warranty center in Colorado. I called after 2 weeks to check status, and was advised the camera had been checked in earlier that week, and it would be another week before I could get status. The next week, 3 weeks after shipping I was told the following:

Lens was jammed because of physical damage, so no warranty. This was also the cause of the framing error, #1. The camera does not have a scratch on it, and was never dropped, hit or abused. I was the only one who used it. How do you debate this with a manufacturer that has limited interest in customer service. They advised it would take 1-2 weeks to get me an estimate, and 2 additional weeks to fix the camera. That would be 7-8 weeks total for the repair. When I commented to the support tech that this was unacceptable service, he stated Pentax was "better then average" for warranty repairs. They have lots of warranty work, and are really back logged at this time of year. (note to potential buyers: says something for the quality of what they are selling) 
Issue #2, they feel was caused by defective airport scanning equipment in Asia, that "scrambled" the firmware. Note, that my laptop didn't get scrambled, and the rest of the camera worked fine, so it probably has a firmware bug.

I have left VM for the warranty center manager, but he never returned my call.

35 days after Pentax received the camera I have an estimate, $320 for the repair they refuse to fix under warranty. Needless to say, I won't be giving Pentax any more of my money, so I opted not to fix the Optio. I feel the money would be better spent on a camera from another manufacturer. I just don't have the confidence this camera will ever be right.  

What I learned: 
1 - Understand the manufacturers warranty coverage. 4 - 8 weeks without your camera is a long time if you use it a lot. If Acura can fix a major electrical issue with my car in 1-2 days, I don't see why a camera manufacturer needs so long to fix a camera that is a current shipping model. It is just poor customer service.
2 - Check a new camera closely at the store. The framing error may have been an indication the lens had been depressed during assembly or shipping. (Pentax warranty center support person statement to me)
