            This is the second Pontiac Grand Am I have owned, and I must say that I am disappointed this time around.

The first one I has, I finally retired with 120,000 miles on it.  I only traded it in at my husband's insistence.  I absolutely loved it!

I had no problems with the Grand Am until it was hit.  The problems were no one's fault except for the person who hit it.  It was a great family car.

The new one...a whole different story.  I got the 6 cylinder instead of the 4 thinking I would like it better.  What a gas guzzler!  The traveling I used to do on 1 tank of gas takes one and a half.

Right after the warranty was expired (of course) something went wrong in the ABS system.  $500.00 down the drain.  When I say right after the warranty ran out, I mean within 1000 miles.

It always sounds like my doors or windows are open, and rides like an old VW bug.

I am very disappointed with my car and when the lease is up will not get another.<br><br>
