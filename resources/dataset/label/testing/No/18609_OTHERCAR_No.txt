            ...Ok. I hate to rain on anyone's parade. My leasing of this vehicle could have been a very pleasant experience, but Oldsmobile squelched that intention....1999 Alero GLS

This car is a pleasure to look at, and it does feel solid and sure while driving it..in town, or on the highway (I work 40 minutes from my home, but it does feel sluggish at acceleration.

KEEP IN MIND THIS CAR IS only ONE AND A HALF YEARS OLD!!!!!

*****UPDATE   OCTOBER 27, 2002******
Ok.  I've been having intermittent starting problems for about 3 months.  Have it looked at?  I did.
I would drive the car for any length of time..it would be fine.  I'd get to my destination...come back to the car, and it would crank powerfully..but wouldn't start.  I eventually killed the battery from trying to crank on the 5th occurrence over 2 week time span, since the car was doing it intermittently.  CHECK ENGINE light came on...took it to the dealer.  It was an O2 sensor, which is common on newer cars.  AutoZone quoted me a price of $75 for the correct sensor (there are several.)  I took it to the dealer just to have it finished with...total cost, $250.00, including $172.00 for the same sensor AutoZone quoted for $75.00.  BS.  Did this correct any the intermittent starting problem?  No.  ROYAL OLDSMOBILE in RICHMOND, VA said after charging me $250.00 for a quick snap off and snap on (15 minutes) of the sensor, that they wouldn't be able to determine the problem, unless they could keep it overnight.  More $$$$ for a rental...GREAT.  But WAIT!  It took 3 months...2 visits to ROYAL OLDSMOBILE IN RICHMOND, VA to NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM...BUT guess what?  I noticed a "SECURITY" light flashing on the dashboard each time this occurred. Soo..I trudged out the owners manual one more time..and looked it up.  It turns out that this light should only come on when you start the car..not flash.  The car is equipped with a passive theft deterrant system..which disables the fuel system, when an 'unrecognized' key is placed in the ignition. (I have 2 keys..both are dealer issued.)  Hm. I just discovered this...and to be honest..I'm afraid to have the security system looked at...cuz God konws it's going to cost $$$$$.



*****UPDATE****May 07, 2002
Ok..had to replace front passenger side wheel bearing. $300.00 at independent garage, vs $525.00 at Olds dealer.
ALSO, Fan control knob for A/C/Heat doesn't blow at first two settings...only in the 3rd position does air actually come out of the vents.  Haven't had this looked at yet.

OLDSMOBILE DISCONTINUING LINE
*****UPDATE****May 25, 2001
The driver side mirror which had a problem with the electric motor has fallen off (The mirror/glass part came unglued from the back plate where it attaches to the motor.)

*****UPDATE****
As of October 18, 2000 a new problem has surfaced...the electric driver side mirror only moves in two directions now...up, and right...the mirror no longer responds to the button on the inside panel which adjusts the mirrors position.  

Main concern:  the fabric on both rear passenger doors is peeling.  The horn started honking one Sunday, and didn't stop.  By itself.  I had to remove the fuse to get it to stop.  The driver side electric window got stuck half way down..I took the car to the local dealer, and they returned a $730 dollar repair bill.  The bill was for repairs made to the window's regulator (the pulley-like system that makes the window go up and down) and the actual window because the part of the window that is connected to the regulator broke...$730 dollars so far for a car just over one year old.  Due to the mileage on the car, my warranty was  out of coverage...by bout 8,000 miles.  

I called the customer service line for OLDSMOBILE.  In a matter of 20 minutes, it was decided that there was NOTHING OLDSMOBILE could do to help.  Why?  1)Mileage exceeded the meager 36,000/3 year warranty. 2)it was a "wearable" part.  3)I could have been slamming the doors repeatedly to make the window and the regulator break.

Ok.  Well, 1)I should have looked at the simple fact only a 36,000 mile warranty was offered...that should have been an indication of what kind of confidence Olds has in this car...2)Electric windows are MADE SPECIFICALLY for going UP and DOWN.  Repeatedly.  HUNDREDS of times.  But this car is ONLY 1 1.5 years old...PARTS THAT WEAR OUT, even if I had rolled them down repeatedly 100 times a day shouldn't wear out in just over a year's usage...3)Why slam the doors EVER if I really want to like and am proud of MY vehicle?  

Bottom line:  Buy the car if you don't do any research or comparable cars in its class.  Buy it if you're an impulse buyer.  Buy it if you don't mind the little things.  (i.e., $730)

I wanted this car because it was new and stylish, especially for an American car.  I liked the way it handled.  I had never owned an Oldsmobile, and like the company's reputation.  I'm 25, and an I.T. specialist...And I've seen mostly people in there 20's driving it.

Olds, I think you may have lost a customer after my lease is up.
