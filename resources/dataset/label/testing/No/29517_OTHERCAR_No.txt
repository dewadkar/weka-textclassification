            I don't know why anyone would even call it &quot;battery life&quot; with the Kodak 240 Digital camera. It's more like battery day or battery hour. It was so convenient to be able to take dozens to hundreds of pictures a day (depending on resolution) and then download them onto the computer, but the one thing that wasn't convenient? Having to charge the batteries every few hours.

This is not a good camera for tourists. True, I don't know much about other digital cameras, but when I bought my Kodak DC 240, it came *with* a battery charger and four rechargeable batteries. At first, when it would go through the batteries, I thought the batteries just were smaller in &quot;capacity&quot;... So, I tried Duracell... Big mistake (expensive mistake.)

So, if you think you should try regular batteries? Don't. Use rechargeable ones, and possibly even get a few extra sets if you're unable to charge regularily or if you're going on vacation. It's such a hassle always running out of battery power.<br><br>
