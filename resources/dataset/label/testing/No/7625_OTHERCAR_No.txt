            My wife bought her 96 Jimmy new in Sept of 1996 and kept it until October of 1999.  In the 3 years she owned it, it was in the shop several times.  The first few times it was in the shop due to alarm problems.  Twice the alarm stranded us when it disarmed, but wouldn't let us start the vehicle.  It ended up in the shop a few times because the spare tire arm on the back would come loose and rattle.  GM replaced this several times to no avail.  We learned to deal with the rattle.  Later, on a trip to NY, the water pump seized shearing the pulley off the pump and leaving us stranded hours from home.  Luckily this was all covered under warranty.  This vehicle has left a bad taste in my mouth for GM products.  At the same time my wife owned this, I also owned a 1996 Ford Explorer.  Considering these 2 vehicles are in the same class, I'd say GMC better learn a thing or to from Ford if they hope to challenge it in the SUV market.  The interior in the GMC was cheap, the seats had very little padding which caused discomfort for any trip lasting longer than a drive around the block.  The ABS seemed to kick in way too early.  To top it off, my Explorer had almost triple the mileage than that of the Jimmy and never had any problems.  It was very disappointing to not be able to rely on the Jimmy considering that it had low mileage and was well taken care of.
