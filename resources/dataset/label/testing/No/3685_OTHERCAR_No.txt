            Strengths:
 I love the fact that I get really good gas mileage, 35 plus mileage.. It's great. It's a really good car for college students. Turning is great, especially in tight spots. It's easy to see out of, I can see all around me. I feel safe in my car. Handles well in turns going faster that the posted speed. It's cute, and I like the headlights, you can see well on the sides of the road. 

Weaknesses:
 Were to start? The cup holders actually aren't able to hold anything, water bottels fall out, go into the floor. I have hold anything when turning or it will fall out. The car makes noises in the doors like a clicking pieace of metal, usually when the wind blows. I have to turn the ac off when getting on the freeway, and it's slow. I have had a few close calls passing, kicks in finally around 55 MPH. Wind noise on freeway or just going 55 plus MPH. The ac isn't that cool. The inside lights suck, such as, the ac light, it's green and it's so dim you have to actually put your hand over it and look really close to see if the light is on. I REALLY needs more power. The way it's shifts is bumpy and sucks, especially when acceleration you can feel the car going through the gears. I test drove the manual Si and it was much smoother. Don't ask me why I got the auto, big mistake. OH can't forget the seats, ouch!!! I'm NEVER ever have been comfortable in that car, and I have to drive to school my back aches. The engine sounds like a macanical noise, not like a engine.. I hate that sound. The sheet metal is so thin it scratches easy and chips and dings easy. The sun visours(don't know how to spell that) don't actually really help keep the sun out of your eyes. There has to be more that I can pick out..... The carpeting is made cheeply and looks cheap to, as well as the door panels. I don't like the fact the buttons for the windows are backwards. The sun roof makes a slight creeking sound. I turn up the music and I can't hear it. The reception of the antenna sucks. When going at high speeds the car goes all over the road, well mostly when it's windy. I can feel the air go under the car and your going all over the road. I don't really like the brakes to well..
I got took on the price, I should have at least paid a thousand or so less for this car. I know my friend got one just like mine for 15,000.  


My civic is almost a year old, it has really low mileage. I love my car and baby it, it's the cleanest car around. Smells new and looks new. It is a practical car for me, but I hate some of the designes on the car. I'm planning on butting really nice seats into that car, because the factory ones feel so hard. My butt hurts and my back hurts sitting in that car. Everyone if your considering in a HOnda Civic or anything please please look at Nissan's. Nissan's are really great cars and they are so comfortable. I wish I could take back the Honda for a Nissan. Who knows maybe after I get the Honda payed off I will get myself a Nissan 300zx tt. Love those cars. Listen to all these people, Civic's arn't that great, and they cost to much for what they are. I was disapointed in what I got, I still love my car but it's disapointing.
