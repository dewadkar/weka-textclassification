            I could hardly wait for my first NEW car in a long time.  So a-shopping I went...Couldn't afford another Cadillac, but wanted a BIG car, so I found myself at the Ford place.  After much looking and driving I decided the next best thing was a Grad Marque.. Well....here we go.  First of all I bought the car, because I really did like the service manager of this particular dealership.  I know that's not a real good reason for buying a car, but being a woman, I needed to be able to trust my service man. 

The car itself, is not bad.  The front seat has plenty of room.  But the back seat is another story.  You have no leg room, and because the front seats' backs are so tall, you can hardly see out the front windows.  I have driven a Cadillac for the last 15 years, so I was used to a lot of room in the front and back seats of my car.  Oh well, enough about the room.  

Gas mileage is acceptable, about 19-20 miles per gallon.  The car handles well, even on wet roads with an &quot;old&quot; lady driving!  I guess the bottom line is, even though I am old, I normally don't &quot;feel&quot; old, except when I'm driving this car!  

Maybe this is my problem, not the car itself.  I probably should have bought a bright red Mustang convertible!  It would have suited my personality better!     

The car is quite comfortable and rides quiet.  It a great car for OLDER people, (I can say that, because I am old), however, I feel like I get  the &quot;looks&quot; when I'm driving.  People seem to be leery of my driving skills, like I might make a simple mistake, i.e. getting in the wrong turn lane, giving the wrong signal, etc.  

But I guess I'll just have to accept the fact..... People stare at LITTLE OLD WOMEN IN GRAND MARQUES!!!!!<br><br>
