            This is a letter my wife and I sent to Chevrolet Assistance after two years of an incredible suite of problems .
I will not recommend to buy any of the Blazer 95 or 96 .They suck .
.....
&quot;..I have bought my used 95 blazer in September 98 and since, I have just had troubles. For example, the very same day, we bought the car, it has been towed twice!! It was like a joke but not funny!! I have been stuck with my children four times. Anyway, during about one year and half, we have had to change:
the alternator, the battery, the wipers motors, the four door switches, the brakes (200$), one window motor, the fuel injector (700$), a lot of wires(400$)!
And NOW, I have to change the exhaust system and in particularly, the catalytic converter which cost, just this part, about 400$!!!
After all these expenses I have been just told that this part isn't under warranty because even if I Have 3 years left, I have 7000 miles more. Each time, I am going to my Chevrolet dealer, I feel like an idiot to have bought this car (our first Chevrolet)and this feeling has never been denied by the service advisors who told me, &quot;well, it's normal, it's old; you need to buy a new one&quot;!!! So if I understand them, your cars can make 5 years and after that (and even before, my problems have started at the end of 98), the owners need to rebuilt them and pay twice the price or throw them away!!...I can't believe it. That is why I am asking you, today, to make a commercial gesture.
I am asking you to agree to extend the warranty of my catalytic converter.
I have been told that my exhaust system is from origin so....you know I will have to pay a lot for that but please, don't make me pay just 400$ for one part (I can't imagine how much will be my bill), just because it hasn't happened 3 months ago!!!! 
I really thank you in advance for what you will do.
Sincerely...&quot;

Of course they never did the gesture nor gave any advices ,The last time I called them ,they just hang on me .Thank you Chevrolet .Next time I buy a german car .(or a french if available)
