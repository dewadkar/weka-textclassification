            Last January I wrote a glowing review of my '92 Audi 100 wagon. (Please note: The older review has now been deleted as per advice from Epinions.com Community Care after I asked if this was legit). I had reasons to like this car and reasons to hate it but I chose to ignore the down side of this car when I wrote the first review. Well, I've had a few more months to contemplate this vehicle and a lot more repair bills. I've been to the dealership for service more times than I'd like to admit and suffered from dealing with arrogant service managers. It seems that an 8 year old Audi is considered scrap by the very people who are supposed to support this expensive car. When I asked the service manager if other Audi's of this vintage have suffered the same sort of stream of major failures mine has, he told me he didn't know since none of their customers keep such old cars. Ouch! They trade in or get a newer one on lease before they reach this vintage. Hmmm���

To those of you who didn't read my old review on this car I'll fill you in on the car's features and then I'll fill you in on my recent experience with breakdowns, costs of repairs, and lack of reliability.

Audi makes world class cars (if you listen to their hype). Mechanically, the designs are semi-exotic. Body design is stiff and strong, drive train is full time All Wheel Drive in the Quattro series. Interiors can be elegant but not gaudy. Mine has firm and comfortable all way power leather seats, interior wood trim, automatic climate control, fully adjustable steering wheel, 4 memory positions for mirrors and seats, and a fuel injected V-6 engine. This truly is a great driving car. Rear sets are roomy and comfortable with a 60-40 split fold down for carrying cargo. 

Handling is precise. Quattro AWD gives great traction in all weather conditions. The engine is quiet and responsive but could use a little more power. The 4-gear automatic transmission is computer controlled and gear shifting is smooth and makes sense. 

Sounds great doesn't it? Hah! Now comes the reality of this thing.

I bought this car in June of '99 from a private owner. It had close to 100,000 miles on it but I figured with Audi's reputation the thing was barely broken in. In reality, it had just started to be broken down!

Soon after I got the car I started having trouble starting the engine. While I was trying to drive it to a local repair station to have this looked at the transmission failed. My beautiful Audi was dead in the water and couldn't be driven. So I had it towed to the transmission guy who said it would cost $3,500 to rebuild the trans. I agreed since I couldn't sell it this way. While the transmission mechanic was road testing the car after fixing the trans, he was driving it down Main Street in my town at 25 mph when the airbag deployed! BANG!!! Scared the guy half to death. He was so shaken up that he refused to continue the work and so the car was towed to the Audi dealer. They agreed to fix the airbag at no charge since it was a recall item (note: I was never notified of this and neither was the previous owner). An additional $1,000 later, the transmission was finished, the airbag was repaired and replaced and now they could finally look at why the engine was hard to start.

Are you seeing red flags yet? I should have by now but I'm one of those disgustingly optimistic people who never see the train coming while sitting on the tracks. 

The dealership did a compression test and low and behold, there was low compression on 4 out of 6 cylinders. Whoa!!! What else could be wrong? They assured me everything else was fine and the car would be as good as new once the engine was rebuilt. I asked why would the engine be so bad after only 100,000 miles? Shoulder shrugs, "Hey we don't know, we just fix 'em." I should have run the other way by now and bought a Toyota or a Suburu. But, Hey! I'm a trusting soul so I figured this is a bad stretch but it will soon be better and all will be fine. After all it is an Audi. So, I said, "Go ahead, rebuild the engine. I'll have a brand new '92 Audi after all this."

So I got my car back after several weeks and over $8,000 for repairs (that counts the transmission repairs, too). I took it on trips, I used it to take friends out to dinner, I drove everyplace and enjoyed knowing I had a refurbished classic Audi that would last forever.

Next scene: 120,000 mile check up a few months later. "Hey buddy, you need brakes. All four wheels, rotors, the whole thing!" More money! 

$1,500 later I had my car again and used it for a summer vacation trip. I noticed the engine was running a little hot and was getting worse by the week. It was getting to the point that I had to run with the heat on full blast (during hot weather) to keep the engine within limits. So I called Audi, they said they couldn't take me for 3 weeks. After much pleading and reminders that I had the engine rebuilt there just a few months ago, they "found" a slot to take me in a week later. The car is still there after three days. 

Now they are telling me the car needs over $1,500 worth of repairs to fix a multitude of problems. Defective instrument cluster components that were causing intermittent erroneous warning displays (around $1,000 for parts), a leaking power steering hose (parts and labor $275), a new thermostat (parts and labor $375), and a leaking valve cover gasket (no charge since they installed this during the engine rebuild and it is now loose). But hey, I'm not gonna let this car get the better of me. I told them to forget it.  Replace the outrageously expensive thermostat (which should have been replaced when the engine was rebuilt) and give me back my junk heap. I'm selling it and will never, ever again get another Audi as long as I live.

So, I'm on my way to the Subaru dealer tonight to get an appraisal on my junk heap and a deal on a trade in. And that's another story.

<b>Update; Feb 13, 2001</b>
I finally got rid of this horrible car and am now the proud owner of a 2001 Subaru Outback Legacy Limited Wagon. I'm sure happy with the Subaru so far and will post a review as soon as Epinions notifiers are up and running again.
