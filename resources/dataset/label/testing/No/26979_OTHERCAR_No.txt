            In my several-month search for a digital camera, I happened to have a chance to use the Konica. If you read my Olympus C-2000 review, you'll know that I ultimately purchased that camera, but since I had hands-on experiences with the Konica for a couple of weeks, I wanted to share my opinions.

For a camera that costs about the same as the Olympus, the Konica is a surprisingly weak competitor.  

Though the camera boasts 2+ megapixels, the image quality falls far short of what I feel it should deliver.  JPEG artifacting is quite noticeable, especially in low-light conditions or when photographing solid color objects.  The lack of optical zoom limits the user to digital zoom, which is of a noticeably poorer quality.  And to top it off, the camera itself is SLOW, often taking 10-15 seconds of recycle time between shots.

On the good side, though, the Konica comes bundled with a lot of nice accessories:  carrying case, battery, battery charger, AC power adapter and an 8 MB mini flash memory card.

Interface support for the camera comes in the form of a standard serial cable (PC-type with a Macintosh adapter), which is - as with other cameras - pretty slow.  For any serious usage, a separate card reader is the way to go.

Some things I do like about the Konica however:  it's a small and lightweight camera and shaped in such a way that you can slip it into a pocket or purse with no problem.  When the power is off, a built-in cover slides closed to protect the lens.  And, the power switch is situated in such a way that it is not confused with the shutter release (my main complaint about the Olympus).

Would I recommend it?  No, not at the current price.  If it were several hundred dollars less than the Olympus, then maybe.<br><br>
