            The famous '94.  It started the day of 31 December 93, when my wife purchased her car.  The first 3 months the car seemed to be fine.  Then it came time already to change the brakes.  These cars go through brake pads like you wouldn't believe. About 6 months later it came time to get new rotors put on because the others were already wore out.  Then 5 months later, new calipers had to be put on.  So within the first 14 months the car had all this trouble with the brakes alone.  

The car was always taken care of.  All fluids were changed out every 3,000-5,000 miles.  We washed it at least once a week, and waxed it at least 2 times a month.  

Everything was working fine until about 6 months ago.  We moved to Texas.  About two weeks after being here, the head gasket blew, and the head got warped. We got that fixed, then 5 months later, at 45,000 miles, the connecting rod went through the block.  That definitely shouldn't have happened this soon.  Now the starter, and washer-fluid motors are bad.  

I have had nothing but problems with this car.  It might have been the bad one of the lot, but I'm sure it wasn't the only one.

The car itself was very nice. Everything inside the car was set up is very user friendly.  I would have kept the car a lot longer if everything wasn't going wrong at 45,000 miles on the car.    <br><br>
