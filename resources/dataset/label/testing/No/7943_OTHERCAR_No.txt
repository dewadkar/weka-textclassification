            I purchased a new 1997 Jeep Wrangler SE in December of 1996. I began hating it the very next day.  The impotent SE model comes stock with an underpowered 4-cyl engine and the smallest P-205 tires you have ever seen.  People actually pointed and laughed when they saw my tiny tires, saying &quot;Here comes the mail-truck, ha ha ha&quot;.  Of course, I eventually gave in and slapped on some bigger treads (30.5&quot; BFG's), and found that the Wrangler's gearing and power became almost unbearably unresponsive and sluggish to this new configuration.  I could barely get up any significant grades on the highway and off-roading was out of the question if hills were present. The highway ride was constantly meandering from centerline and the noise inside the vehicle was irritatingly loud.  The crappy plastic windows will scratch if you even look at them the wrong way, and can never be restored to their original clarity.  After putting back-on the original tires, I gained little performance, and the vehicle started falling apart.  My engine would sputter and quit for no reason while I was driving.  My alternator died TWICE.  The shifter came off in my hand once while I was pulling out into traffic, and the seats were extremely uncomfortable the whole time.  When parked, this car looks great and it was fun to cruise around on level ground with the top down.  Otherwise I HATED this car.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE buy the 6-cyl 4.0L engine if you can stand the noise, uncomfortable ride, and scratched windows. <br><br>
