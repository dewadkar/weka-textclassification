            I had the honor of driving one of these when my truck was in the shop getting fixed and I rented a car while the work was being done.

Its pretty small, I'd say full size car, but the people in the back seat would be pretty uncomfortable in it after driving more than an hour...It definitely is a sharp looking car...the chicks seem to dig it.  Everyone in my building was drooling over "my new car" until they found out mine was getting fixed.  Then they ranted and drooled like herion addicts about how much they loved it.  Only if they drove it like I did...maybe they did?  I doubt it.

Mine sported the AM/FM Cassette.  Dolby NR (Noise Reduction)...I actually broke out some old tapes and gave it a whirl.  With NR enabled, it sounded like it was off, I generally hate NR regardless of what the quality of the deck is..it always alters the sound..took out my highs bigtime..I didn't expect much less from tape anyway.  It did know when I put a high quality tape in the deck though and did fast forward to tracks..I guess its one of those "full featured but not tape decks."  I'm sure you could get a CD player in it and changer controls as well..but..who cares as I couldn't see myself in the car long enough to care.  I'd rather duck at traffic lights and pretend I wasn't in it.  Sometimes the road noise was so loud I forgot I had it on.

I had the honor of getting a convertable in the middle of winter in 5 degree weather--so I wasn't taking the top down anytime soon.  But would've been cool to do driving along the beach, or maybe do it as a joke pulling up to a friends house with the snot frozen from my nose.

Side view mirrors are tiny, so small that I have to turn my head to look back and make sure no one's behind me.  Turns out, looking behind me doesn't help too much anyway.  The blindspots are so bad I was nervous changing lanes.  Maybe i'm just used to my gigantic side view mirrors and no blindspots.  The car just felt unsafe..

The pickup was pretty nice, but when I really wanted to lay it down, I thought the engine was going to come out of the hood.  Maybe I'm just used to an 8 cyl engine...I think the car looks a lot faster than it really is.  Don't get me wrong, this car can handle its own and some, but at higher speeds I felt like the wheel wanted to steer itself and make the car do stunts.

Gas...ugh.  What at first I thought was going to be good, the little ~18 gallon tank lasts about the same milage as my 23 gallon truck tank.  Feeds on 87 octane, but c'mon..I felt like I was at the pump every ten seconds..Thought I was suppose to be driving, not pumping gas.

Everytime exiting the vechicle, I felt like I was rolling out of the car..it was almost half a workout.  Once your in, it's pretty confortable, although myself looks like I don't belong in the car at all.  Then when going to shut the door, always got a nice big shock.  Could've been the rentacar itself, but who knows..

I dunno, maybe this is just a "chick" car or maybe I'm just used to my fullsize truck..but it didn't feel safe one bit.
I do have to admit, pulling into parking spots was excellent.  Done with ease.
