            I would have said that this was a love/hate relationship, but it degenerated into hate.
At first glance, there was a lot to commend about this car. It's roomier, faster, and handles better than the current Q45 (which is technically a Q41, since the engine size dropped). If these are features you like, this car fits the bill.

However, the Q I had was a headache. I'll try to recall all of the repairs I had to make to it:
-- Replaced three fuel injector jets
-- Replaced master cylinder
-- Replaced right torsion bar
-- Replaced water pump
-- Electrical harness to leading to rear (died again soon after)

Broken but not replaced when car was tossed away:
-- Right sunshade (never used) popped out of the roof; I epoxied it in place
-- Fiber optic cable to left sunshade's mirror light separated
-- Center console ashtray (rarely opened) stopped springing open; had to be pulled open.
-- Sunroof motor broken
--  the air conditioning had stopped working: recharging it didn't help.
-- The motor for the power roof (which was used only occasionally) worked only intermittently.

I hope that my experience was unique; I would wish this car on no one.
