            My husband and I decide to look into Mini-vans a few years ago.  I was going to be working in child care and needed a large vehicle then my Chevy Cavalier.  With my daughter (6mo) in tow we went in search of a &quot;Used&quot; mini-van.  After looking high and low, we came to the 1995 Voyager.  It was simple and in the price range at the time. 

 We took it home and within two weeks started having problems with the van, mainly the Transmission!  Thank Goodness for extended warrantees.  The first one was covered, that's right, there was more!  Within 11months we went through FIVE transmissions!

  Finally the last one the dealer figured he could possible try a new transmission instead of the rebuilt ones he had been using.  With in a month the &quot;NEW&quot; transmission was gone.  I took the van in and asked them to trade it in or figure something out with the dealer, but they would do nothing!  

I talked to one of the high mechanics at the Dealership, he told me that they have more of these vans come in for the transmissions then they have come in for any other maintenance.  I still have the van, and today it started acting up again, its somewhat funny now!  I say that because my warrantee runs out in two weeks! 

 Obviously, I would not recommend this van to anyone, however, if anyone is looking for a lemon!  Give me a call, I've got a sour one for you(just kidding).  The lemon comment, I tried to talk to someone about the &quot;Lemon Law&quot; unfortunately for me, fortunately for the dealer, this law does not apply to used vehicles.  

 Boy, oh boy, did I get a Lemon!<br><br>
