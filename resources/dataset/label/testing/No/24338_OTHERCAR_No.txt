            Well here is one for you take it at will. In 1998 I bought an new Dokato 4 cyclinder. Well I really liked it some few problems but no biggy. Well decided that I wanted something bigger for family and such. Well ended up trading in my 1998 for an extended cab 6 cyclinder. On day two of buying this vechicle it has been in the shop getting repaired. On the second day of owning this vechicle the check engine light comes on and I lose all my oil pressure sitting at an light. So ok I look throught the manual and check the oil and tran fluid levels which seem to be over what they are suppose to have. Ok then I take it to the shop and they say it is running fine and that they went all over and nothing ever happened. So the only thing that I got out of that is that I was a 1/2 tank empty on fuel. Well ever since then the light gets worse and worse, now everytime that I stop it comes on, no pressure and the Engine is just a knocking for all it is worth. Still the repair folks say that there is nothing wrong with it. I am just hoping that the thing seizes so that I can take it to them. I talked to a friend who owns the same thing and she is have some of the same problems like it not wanting to shift which my truck seems to that more often than not. Point is be aware of those Dodge Dakotas out there. Also the milage isnt that good either.<br><br>
