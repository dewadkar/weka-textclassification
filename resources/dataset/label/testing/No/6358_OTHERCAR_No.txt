            I have always thought very fondly of the NASCAR concepts of yore, and by this, I mean the 60�s and 70�s. The cars driven were lean, mean, race versions of the actual street cars you could go down to your local dealer and buy. The real heck of it was, the 426 and 429 engines (you know who I�m referring to), seemed not so different from what you got on the street, relatively speaking. Race teams looked like a rag tag bunch of rebels that survived their corporate shells through perseverance and sheer craftiness. Each race, new methods for cheating were attempted such as plastic support bushings in the suspensions that were not made of thermoplastic, which would disintegrate under the stress of the race, there by gradually lowering the cars beneath regulation height. Brilliance! Nobody looked down on this, as competition came not only from other teams, but also from NASCAR officials. It was passionate, it was desperate, and it was cool. 

These days, corporate sponsorship is so rampant that identifiable paint schemes now seem to fall as a backdrop to cheap logos. Rules are so stringent and complicated, and the hot dog, gear heads that used to drive the cars have been replaced with media-savvy, poster boys who are as inclined to hock Dorito�s brand chips as they are hang one out for the cause (fame is, of course, proof of the existence of gullibility). The sport does not seem to be about cars anymore.  Furthermore, I do not understand the passion for it anymore either. Living in the south as I do, NASCAR is a way of life for much of my surrounding culture. Because the new racecars share nothing with their street going counterparts, other than a brand name, I have trouble understanding how all of these Chevy and Ford guys and gals can feel much involvement. Used to be, that when a 426 Superbird (lets just say number 43, for kicks) crossed the finish line first, then that spoke great things for the Hemi Road Runner that you had in the parking lot. 

Still, you cannot argue with the numbers. NASCAR racing is highly popular in the Southeastern United States and generates tons of revenue. It is a respectable sport that does not seem to foster embarrassing contract disputes, detestable salaries, unnerving striking, or unsavory characters wearing wedding gowns just for a little recognition. The stakes are also quite high and there really are no cushy time outs to speak of. I do not follow NASCAR very closely, so these are just an outsiders opinion of the way that it appears. But I believe it to still be quite raw.

The Hemis are gone from the circuit parking lots, though. The Cobra Jets and Super Sports as well.  
Not too much has really changed in this area of the fairgrounds, though, as those cars modern day equivalences have come to take their places. You do not have to look too hard to find a T-Bird, Lumina, or even Avenger. One such car that I have noticed becoming rampant among the civilized in the south is the Chevrolet�s new Monte Carlo.

With its long hood/short deck theme, stylish coupe body and driver oriented cockpit, the original, 1970 Monte Carlo helped to define the still emerging personal luxury car segment. Based on the redesigned, 69� Grand Prix, the muscular Monte became the champion of the working man, offering up luxury, style, and performance that aped the Eldorado, but could be had with Impala money. In it�s first year, almost 146,000 units were sold. Reflecting the growing success of the segment, the 1973 Monte received a heavily sculpted make over, sporting an additional four inches of length and some 200 pounds of girth. As trends, fueled by the environment, changed, so did General Motors. 1977 saw a corporate wide downsize of its big cars. For 1978, the Monte followed suite, shedding nearly a foot, and 800 pounds. The fourth generation Monte, which debuted in 1981, began to make a move back to sporty. This is especially true with the 1983 rebirth of the Super Sport Monte. The times, though, changed again as the late eighties began to see, what was then viewed as the death of rear drive cars. The Monte Carlo had no business with this country anymore and quietly faded away after the 1988 model year. Duties of the Monte were effectively split up between the Camaro, Beretta, and Celebrity coupes, depending on what market you would have wanted a Monte Carlo for. The space was then filled by the Lumina coupe of 1990.  When the second generation Lumina bowed for the 1995 model year, the Monte Carlo was reborn � and with front wheel drive too. This new car sold a respectable, 100,000 units in its best year, 60,000 in it is worst.  For this Monte to regain its former glory as a personal luxury coupe, though, it would have to break away from the Lumina family sedan, or die in the market place.

The coupe market was resurging with energy and retro was the buzzword of the month. Chevrolet had revived the Monte Carlo name, but they had not brought the car back with it. For the 2000 model year, Chevrolet brought them both back, way back. Compared to any previous Monte Carlo, the 2000 model is somewhat of a new car, being built on the same platform as the new Impala (the last Monte was little more than a 2-door Lumina). 

Anyone who may have read my Impala article (5/25/01 Retro Gone Horribly Wrong) may be able to anticipate my feelings about the Monte Carlo, as it is of a similar formula. I must say, that the styling of the Monte is a more fully realized, adaptive reuse of the retro idea, and unlike the Impala, it is clear the car was considered as a whole. The new model has Monte cues in places that other cars do not even have places, and I like that. In addition, I must suggest judging the appearance of the Monte only in person, as its sheer theatrics are lost in pictures, and you have to be there to appreciate it. The body terminates in a very cut off, and abruptly angular fashion at the bottom of the car. Because the Monte has a relatively wide stance, slab body, and low greenhouse, it gives the car a custom low-rider look that is very dramatic. The tail lamps are sensational. Simple, slender, tapering units are placed at the corners, housing two attractive, legible circular lamps beneath tinted plastic covers. This is how the ungainly, Frisbee-sized tail lamps on the Impala should have been treated. The subtle, angular bumper juts at the corners lend a cool 70�s Monte feel and are unique in today�s market. Finally, the SS model that I drove was painted this luscious shade of red that will cause you to be weak in the knees. The quality of the paint was good, far better than any Lumina I have ever experienced.

Unfortunately, the accolades for exterior styling end there. Its many individual components tend to retain their own individual characteristics a bit too much, causing the overall feel to be very incohesive and less than the sum total of its parts. It seems humpy, bumpy, overwrought, and ladened with unnecessary plastics. Part of the problem is the execution. The other part is the product that the inspiration was derived from. Instead of choosing the muscular first generation Monte, or the sleek fourth generation, they seemingly choose the bloated second-generation version to draw their cues. This car was a terribly over done coupe, featuring all that was wrong with decadent cars of the 1970�s. Perhaps, though, this Monte had better odds in the new millennium than any other, as with this version, Chevy moved the most cars, peaking at an astonishing 400,000 units in 1977. This creates a new problem, though. For many people I have spoken to who were a bit too young to remember the second gen Monte and the influence that it had on our roads, the concept is a bit lost on them. Once I begin to explain the reuses of design elements and concepts to them, they act as if they understand, but I can see in their eyes and their demeanor, that they feel that the concepts of the mid-seventies Monte are at odds with modern profiles and materials. They may not have the exact words, but it is obvious that they feel this way with comments such as �well, its nice, but I like how they did the Beetle better�.

 On the original, the sweep spears owned the sides of the car by making a firm commitment to the sheet metal. The ones on the new Monte seem unnecessarily tacked on at the last minute. They interrupt the clean fa�ade of the body, but do not commit to shaping the design.  Also, scaled and located as they are, they seem to pay more homage to the 68 and 69 Plymouth GTX. The sweeps are also at odds with all of the other lines of the profile (belt line, rub strip, bumper/body seams, and two separate rocker lines), which are all parallel to the road. Perhaps this idea would have worked better not as sweeps, but as muscular fender bulges, like on the Maserati Shamal or Porsche 944. The greenhouse area has a lot of glass and little sheet metal (especially with the optional moon roof), which makes it seem like a very small element perched atop the lower body. This aids in making the Monte appear immense. The aluminum rims are unimaginative, five-spoke arrangements that are only 16 inches in diameter. If Chevy bumped them up to 17, or even 18 inchers, it would help to alleviate some of the body�s bulkiness. 

 The car�s nose is a problem as well, being an amalgam of bland, Lumina feel, with a few inappropriate �Monte spec� features tacked on. The resulting, rental car look betrays the drama of the rest of the car. The fog lamps do not relate well to any of the other elements of the bumper and seem random. In addition, they are scaled poorly for the headlamps that they are paired with. The headlamps are another strange affair. They look a bit like eyes, but not quite. They have a circular prominence harking back to the single lamp design of the earlier 70�s Monte, but have these strange flanks that make them appear like wavy, stylized Chevrolet logos. Ultimately, they seem to have no definable shape and are very unpleasant to look at. If the lower air intake were a bit deeper, or taller, and not tightly grilled, it could retrieve some of the Monte�s custom low-rider appeal. I cannot stand the retro, Monte Carlo insignia on the nose. Perhaps there is some historical Monacan significance to this indescribable logo that I am unaware of, but it looks to be simply made up by some cynical marketing types in an effort to give the original Monte a little cache. In modern application, it seems unnecessary and senseless to have this on the nose and an unrelated Chevy bowtie on the tail. The cursive Monte Carlo script is borrowed as well and is unfit for such a modern car with a monochromatic design scheme.  I said earlier that the Monte had a relatively wide stance, which is true, at 62.1 front, and 61.2 rear. However, it is a little narrow for the body. Where as the bodies of some competitors such as the Pontiac Grand Prix GT and Dodge Stratus R/T, appear poured over the mechanicals, the Monte appears to have been built, and then had a bodiless Impala shoved up into it. Again, larger and wider tires could help to remedy this poor body/wheel relationship that undermines the aggressiveness of the car. Finally, this �powerful luxury coupe� has a genuine dual exhaust system, so why are there no fat, polished chrome exhaust tips? 

Inside the Monte, I was satisfied over all. The interior is clean and relatively simple, though far too bland. Everything was gray. Since this is supposed to be somewhat of a driver�s car, the fact that at least the steering wheel isn�t black is quite a faux pas. From the driver seat, all that glass that I complained about does not seem so wrong when soaking up the good, cockpit visibility. It is not like surveying the road from an Accord coupe, but for this sort of car, I was more than satisfied. The Monte I examined had leather seating surfaces, which felt a little too much like good vinyl. The rear bench seat made an effort to seem dedicated for two passengers with deepened seat pans and individual headrests. However, it looked too benchy and cheap, especially with the center armrest folded up. Also, the seam between the bottom of the bench and the floor was very uneven and wide, making it look ill fitted. All of the seats felt comfortable to me, though lumbar and side support were lacking, so beware of long trips or spirited driving. Oh boy! The optional instrument cluster was well fortified with information and all of the buttons and controls easy to use and read. The dash looked a touch clunky, but far better than the Impala. My only real problem here is a silly curving character line over the passenger side airbag that seems to serve no purpose. I liked the AM/FM, CD/cassette stereo, which is radio-data-system capable. Using encrypted information from FM stations, it allows you to scan by desired radio subject (pop, country, etc). The center console was attractive, and the armrest well positioned, but why does GM feel it necessary to periodically use sloppy fabric shift boots for an automatic transmission shifter? It is unnecessary and adds needless difficulty in relating the position of the lever to that of the gear indicator below it. Lots of criticism, I know, but the car feels roomy, comfortable and nicely isolated.  Textures feel nice and the steering wheel, complete with grips, is a terrific thickness. Ultimately, I was satisfied, except for two issues. Have Chevrolet designers been living on Mars, in a cave, with their fingers in their ears? Is this a foot operated parking brake that I am seeing? Furthermore, why are the seatbelts being routed through cheap looking, plastic loops on the seat, making rear seat ingress/egress even more difficult? These two small issues are nearly inexcusable in a 2000 model car.

As previously eluded to, the Monte body is stuffed with an Impala. Engine choices will seem similar, beginning with the standard 3.4 liter V6, offering up 180 horsepower. Step up to the SS and take advantage of the 3800 V6, which has become as comfortable at General Motors as Wayne Newton has in Vegas. The base LS with its smaller V6 minivan motor, will feel very generic in its behavior. Not real fast, not very slow, and thoroughly anonymous. The edgier SS model that I sampled felt just like any other 3.8 liter Regal or Grand Prix that I have ever driven. 200 horsepower and 225 pound feet of torque are delivered through GM�s equally familiar 4L60-E, four speed automatic. These two components have danced together quiet a bit in the past and are very well matched. The transmission receives power smoothly, quietly, and plentifully, with quick and decisive shifts. Unlike some other GM automatics I have experienced in the past, this one always finds the right gear and never hesitates to downshift in order to maintain a steady hill climb. 0-60 arrives with a whoosh of torque in a respectable 7.9 seconds. The engine feels good, but is quite gray around the temples. While some competition is offering modern, efficient aluminum designs featuring multi overhead cams and valves a plenty, the Monte soldiers on with an iron block, push rods, and only two valves per cylinder. The last generation Monte initially used a terrific 24-valve, dual overhead cam plant, which was unfortunately deemed to expensive to continue producing. Oh, well, back to the present. How does such an old, dated design still cut the mustard? Well, it has sheer size and evolution on its side. GM has sufficiently worked the bugs out of this one over the years. I like revvy tach-dancing myself, but the engine does provide the exact sort of reliability, simplicity, and bottom end torque that perspective buyers of this sort of car look for. What ever does it for ya. 

Four-wheel disk, anti-lock assisted braking from 70 miles per hour is satisfactory, but less than some competitors at 194 feet. The Monte�s body structure felt surprisingly solid in cornering and over broken pavement. Handling, via simple struts and coils springs all around, was also positive for this sort of car. Turns were tight and precise with little noticeable body roll, all the while providing a confident ride. Steering is a point where the 2000 Monte clearly diverges from the original�s concept, feeling light and precise enough to almost make this behemoth feel nimble. The Goodyear Eagles struck a good balance between grip and comfort. Fuel economy will please the average Monte buyer, being 20/29 city/highway. The Interstate seems to be where this car is most at home. High speed, straight line cruising and lane change maneuvers will make you feel safe and confident.

The Monte SS I tested belonged to a friends husband, fitting precisely into Chevy�s early 40�s, male target audience. The Super Sport package provides the 3800, sport suspension, upgraded instrumentation, upgraded tires wrapped around 16 inch wheels, dual exhaust, sport buckets with armrest, spoiler, fog lamps, and leather steering wheel with very useful hub mounted stereo and cruise controls. I would opt for the monochrome SS over the standard model if the checkbook allows. With a rich powertrain, comfortable interior, confident performance and unique styling, the Monte seemingly has a lot on the ball. Unfortunately, the styling is a bit too cerebral to be effective and applied with limp-wristed commitment. The interior is too �rental car� in nature, and the mechanicals are not going to impress anyone with a VTEC plant under their hood. I can understand why southeastern NASCAR fans and diehard Chevrolet loyalists will flock to this car, as it fulfills all their automotive dreams with gusto. However, I believe that its appeal will be lost on the remaining 95% of us, and this car will do little to bring new buyers into the fold.

For the Super Sport Monte�s $24,000 asking price, buyers can also consider Dodge�s new Mitsubishi influenced Stratus R/T Coupe and Ford�s 8-cylinder Mustang GT.  These coupes offer similar features, cohesive styling, attractively appointed interiors with better quality leather, more involving performance, modern engines, and available manual transmissions. Wouldn�t set foot near Dearborn or Highland Park? Fine. The same money can also get you Chevrolet�s aggressively styled Camaro Z28, which can match performance with anything in this price class. Can�t stomach the insurance? Buyers should then definitely consider sister Pontiac�s cleanly chiseled Grand Prix GT. This car offers similar engineering to the Monte, but is wrapped in one of the sexiest coupe bodies you can buy today. If you can pony up an extra few grand, you can even move yourself into the ferociously supercharged Grand Prix GTP, which moves your 0-60 time into the mid 6�s. That seems to be my bottom line. While the Monte has notable attributes, there are simply better performing and more maturely styled alternatives available on the market � which renders the retro Monte, a bit uncompetitive.  
I believe NASCAR Winston Cup races have become more of a social club than anything else. The Ford guys sit over here. The Chevy Guys sit over there. Everyone has fun drinking, talking, comparing stories, and hoping for spectacular, non-injury crashes, all the while poking innocent fun at the fools in the other camp. Seems like good old American fun to me. As long as this appeals more than 60,000 buyers a year, which believe that what Jeff Gordon drives, relates at all to what is in their garage, then the Monte will have an audience to entertain. I�ll pass though, thank you, as I feel the sport now relates a bit more to Madison Avenue than Woodward Avenue (the Monte being no exception) than I care for. Besides, I sunburn very easily and would not last the first 40 laps.
