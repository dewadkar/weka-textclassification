            I purchased a brand new Grand Cherokee last year with great hopes that they had fixed some quality issues. But, the demons are still there and Chrysler will not stand behind their products!
With about 27,000 KM (16,000 miles) the seats have bagged out and offer no support, granted I am a big man but they should last longer than that. From the day I drove it home the driver's side window has had a wind leak and whistles on the highway, two attempts to fix to no avail. 
The Jeep has a grinding noise coming from the front suspension when you go over speed bumps, the dealer can not find the cause.
And now the brake rotors are warped and need to be replaced, not covered under warranty I am told by Chrysler! The reason is that they all fail on this model and it would cost too much to replace everyone's rotors! 
Why can't they just build it right the first time?
The Truck has other various problems from the drink holders to various squeaks and rattles.
The transmission is very rough in shifting and I took it to two different shops to correct it but was told they all shift like that! It did not fail but it did not instill confidence either.
The positives are hard to find when you are this disappointed in a vehicle and the company that built it. However in fairness, I still like the look and style of the truck and the dash and interior of the truck are nice, too bad they didn't build it better!
