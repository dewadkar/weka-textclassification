               First off, let me tell you a little about myself and how I have come to this type of review.
I am a 40 year old state of Michigan mechanic, certified in steering and suspension systems. I  am considered  an expert in the field of undercar diagnoses and repair, having rebuilt and aligned literally thousands of steering and suspension systems, ranging from vehicles as small as a Mazda Miata up to 1 ton truck chassis, and am involved in a continually ongoing cycle of training as new technology demands.

        I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.

       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

           Now on to the Chevrolet S-10. In all of my years of working on front ends I have come to love the S-10. Why would a mechanic love a vehicle so much,? because it's like a prison meal...bread and butter. The front ends of these vehicles are woefully underbuilt in this man's epinion. I have rebuilt so many S-10 front ends that I can go to my tool box and grab every tool I will need to do the job from memory. 

      First off, the ball joints on these vehicles, though factory greasable are not up to the task. Why they go through so many ball joints is a mystery. The OEM ball joints must be made out of old newspaper or something, they are just plain weak. I have replaced factory ball joints on S-10 pick-ups and Blazers in as little as 35,000 miles. The upper ball joints which used to be the strong point get weaker every time GM re-designs the front end. The lower ball joints, ever since the inception of the S-10 have been a sore spot.  

       The idler arm also on this vehicle gets loose very quickly, and will need to be replaced sooner than one would expect, but through the years G.M. has come up with a very interesting solution for this problem. When customers complain to get the idler arm replaced at the dealer, when an alignment can't be performed in a non G.M. shop due to loose front end parts,   G.M. has increased the acceptably loose tolerance year by year so it will meet the manufacturers range and not be required to replace the part under warranty, AND THEY GO TO ENGINEERING SCHOOL FOR THIS !! 

     The worst is yet to come. A 4 ball joint/ idler arm job with parts labor and alignment will  cost around $600.00 and the shop where I work has the lowest labor rate of anywhere I have found, $40.00 HR. Of course this will only be found out after your tires are shot and the vehicle is out of warranty !

    One good part though, is that mostly every aftermarket parts company offers a lifetime warranty on parts, so when and not if the 2nd set of parts gets loose, keep your receipts and the parts shouldn't cost you anything. But you will have to ante up on labor and alignment all over again and try to fight with the parts manufacturer on labor recovery.

    This goes for GMC S-15 Jimmys also...same undercar, same factory, just a different logo. So if you just can't live without the S-10/ 15 go ahead and pick one up.  Just save all your nickels and dimes for the countdown to ball joint time.... tick tock tick tock <br><br>
