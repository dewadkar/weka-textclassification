            I'm a 39yr old guy and I bought this car for commuting back &amp; forth to work mostly in city traffic with occasional highway driving. I previously owned a '92 Honda Civic Si, and loved it... I have been HUGELY disappointed with the new Si. First, the vehicle is severely underpowered below 5500 RPM's. With a paltry peak torque of 110lbs/ft that occurs around 7500 RPM, it is hard to get the vehicle to move without flooring it, and then waiting for the engine to wind up to well over 5500 RPM. I have driven this vehicle VERY conservatively at times (never going over 4000 RPM for an entire tank of gas), and I still cannot get more than 21mpg's!!! I have had the vehicle to the dealer twice, and he reports nothing is wrong. The service manager even kept the vehicle overnight, drove the car to his home and back, and reported back to me that he got a little over 16mpg!!!!! Yet he refuses to concede that this is a problem. On the chat board devoted to Honda Civic Si owners (ClubSi.com), I have come across quite a few other owners with serious fuel economy problems. It seems to be a 50/50 shot with the Civic Si, you might get a good one, you might get a bad one. It runs fine, but with average gas mileage of 19mpg, I was doing better with a '94 Ford Taurus I used to own. On my previous 92 Civic Si, I averaged 28 mpg. It is not  worth taking this vehicle on any long trip because the range is limited, I am lucky if I can get over 170 miles on a tank of gas. Also, at highway speeds the excessive road noise drowns out the underpowered radio. It is a shame that I found out after buying this vehicle that it is a &quot;toy&quot; that appeals to teenagers and backyard mechanics who are willing to spend an extra 5 to 6 grand in aftermarket parts to make the vehicle tolerable. In my honest opinion the Civic Si is a subcompact &quot;sports-car-wannabe&quot; with a 4-cylinder engine that sucks as much gas an 8-cylinder engine, in order to achieve the performance of a 6-cylinder engine. You CAN do much better! <br><br>
