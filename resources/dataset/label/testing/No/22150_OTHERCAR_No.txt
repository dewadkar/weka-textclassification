            Well, I'll start by saying there is not much good about this camera. 

I wanted to buy a good camera that would let me do webcam and regular digital camera functions. This made me have very little selection here in Canada, and I regret buying anything after buying this. 

Pros

 - This camera is a very high quality, for a webcam.
 - Decent plastic swivel attatchment for the camera to sit on when using as a webcam.

Cons

 - While I'm no photographer, I have extreme difficulty getting this camera to focus it's pictures in any situations. They come blurry and grainy more often than not!
 - Quality is poor even on the rare occasion the picture is focused
 - The automatic flash doesn't work reliably what-so-ever. When I bought the camera I turned on the flash function but it would never work in even the most dark conditions. Then suddenly, one day it works! Never worked again after that. 
 - Often a pain to get functioning properly. I'm far from a computer amateur, and with Windows XP it took about 30 minutes of fooling with downloading drivers and such to get it to function. Definitely something a beginner should be scared of.
 - The video function is useless. The picture quality is so terrible there is no point to use it, in my opinion. If I recall, it is roughly 320x180 resolution. Completely blurred and grainy.
 - Sensitive to light. You need perfect lighting conditions for a picture to turn out. It'll easily be too bright or too dark.

If there's any suggestion I can give you, it's to not buy this camera. This camera might be decent if it cost around the $40 mark, but it doesn't at the time of this writing.
