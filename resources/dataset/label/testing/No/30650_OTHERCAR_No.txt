            I purchased the Metro to make a 120 mile roundtrip drive to work, my requirements were air conditioning, a 5 speed transmission, and the 1.0 motor to maximize gas mileage. 
 
The fact that it also had the stereo cassette upgrade radio makes the drive much nicer. I did upgrade my speakers and it now has great sound.
LOVES
I love driving this car and have been very happy with the gas mileage. I have never reached the high extreme (47 mpg) but also drive at speeds (70+) that make the higher mileage impossible. The overall styling (2 door)is also a plus. I'm 6 feet tall and am able to fit into the car with great leg room. It's bright red color is attractive and maintains a glow when polished. The interior is well thought out and controls easy to reach.
HATES
The acceleration is sluggish but I knew that going in, after the break in period it is better. The major complaint has been service related as the dealers are not stocking parts and service takes forever as they locate and get the parts needed to fix your car. Add the fact that they only wish to provide a loner car for 3 days and it could become costly waiting for your car to be fixed. My dealer stated I would be responsible for car rental after the three days. I did have a major problem with the transmission, 5th gear kept popping out, the repair parts took three weeks to order and it took two tries for the dealer to fix the problem. It still has a growl in the transmission which concerns me. I continue to have problems with the transmission which I cannot seem to resolve and have filed a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive repair in regards to. I will continue to try to get this repaired or attempt to trade the car in to make certain I have a reliable car to travel to work with.
