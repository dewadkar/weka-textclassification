            Upon purchasing the '02 Spec V model during the summer of '03, I was grinning from ear to ear with the pleasure from driving this rocket.  The car is comfortable, even for a 6'2" lanky guy like myself.  Excellent steering response; 2 turns lock to lock.  The car has terrible turning radius for parking though.  The stock suspension handles excellently although some uncertainty when pushed to the limit.  Traction is a problem with the '02 gear ratios taking off from a stop; mine now has an '03 transmission due to a LSD failure at 30K.  Braking is moderate; I upgraded to a 4-piston 12.2" Fastbrakes setup up front which helped.  I lowered the car with Eibach Sportlines for a better stance and also added the Eibach Anti-Roll kit which provided the most positive handling difference.  The engine began consuming oil from day one.  Supposedly Nissan put ceramic oil rings in the early build '02s.  The rings wouldn't seat until about 5K miles when the car finally stopped consuming oil.  At 7K the car began leaking oil.  After two attempts to identify the leak; I assumed a rear main since the gap between the bellhousing and block was soaked; Nissan failed to fix it.  I drove the car from the east to the west coast and a dealer in AZ found the problem: a porous block.  The new engine went in at 25K miles.  Also, the catalytic converter/exhaust manifold combo was replaced as a pre-recall move.  At 35K Nissan recalled the catalytic converter again for heat shields.  At 42K the catalyst material came apart and clogged the entire exhaust system.  The engine now smokes all the time and I can't keep oil on the dipstick.  I believe I have had my share of this Nissan and fear the worst again; yet another engine replacement.  Nissan has warrantied my problems which has been great.  I just wish I didn't know all the dealer's service writers, shuttle drivers and techs on a first name basis!
