            They can make a nice offer with snowboard or skis thing but that does'nt replace good quality craftmanship. The entire line of KIA's will make you think (I could of swarn I just saw the exact same car at the Ford dealership I was just at). Know you have to admit that they are asking too much for the car when all they did was look at other cars and remake them with diffrent names and cheaper parts. I mean you could pay anywhere from $16,000 to $20,000 i think that they could have done a lot better with this auto mobile and they could of come up with something more original.<br><br>
