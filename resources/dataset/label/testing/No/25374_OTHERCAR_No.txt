            The camera was initially purchased by Mom and Dad.  However, we quickly gained use of the device, and were rather excited at the prospect of rapidly sending photos of our shennanigans to out of town friends.  We rapidly discovered that this necessitates the purchase of dozens of batteries.  At the lowest resolution 35 photos were taken and the batteries were dead.  With the flash, it was closer to 25.  At medium resolution and with a flash, 16-70 photos max.  And NO PEEKING.  If you use the LED screen as a viewfinder, you're lucky to get 7-12 photos with a flash.  Want to view the photos that you've taken?  Then kiss your brand new set goodbye.  No exageration, I showed the stored images to a friend on a brand new set of batteries, and they were dead after we went through all 35 of them.  Calculate the cost of a four pack of AA batteries, and the time spent changing out sets of 4, and it rapidly becomes uneconomical to take medium resolution photos, especially at night.  A great disappointment in economy, even if the pictures were of good quality.

Also, be sure to hold the camera very still.  Each frame takes 3-4 seconds to capture the image.  This was something to get used to after years of SLR use.  I've captured quite a few interesting digital rainbows.<br><br>
