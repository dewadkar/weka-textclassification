            In 1996 we bought a C250 Diesel Mercedes. They give us a warranty for 120 000km. At the end of August 2000 we took the car for the last service on 119 500 km. On 11 November 2000, with 125 000 km the engine of the car just exploded and everything in the engine was badly damaged. 5000 km after the expiry time of the warranty. The garage told us that the engine will cost us R55 000 (more or less $7300). 
The typical Mercedes qualities such as maximum safety, top quality, exemplary comfort and total reliability was to my opinion not part of our purchase. At 7 p.m. I was driving home. There was no sign whatsoever that could indicate to me that their was anything wrong with the car. The engine just exploded. 
The representative of Daimler Chrysler looked at the engine and here is his report. The damage was caused as a result of water entry into the diesel fuel. They are not going to help us to replace the engine. He didn't take a single drop of diesel to analyse. We did not accept his inspection report and took the engine to the Automobile Association. Here is their report: As noted during the inspection, it is our considered opinion that failure of the No. 1 cylinder front exhaust valve had been the cause of engine failure, etc. Daimler Chrysler send us this message: &quot;We are sorry to note that you are unhappy with the decision made by our representative. His decision was made after careful consideration of the matter, both in terms of your expectations and of our company's warranty and goodwill parameters. The decision he arrived at is the best outcome we can achieve on behalf of Daimler Chrysler South Africa.
We can't believe it. We paid a lot of money. We used the car for high days and holidays and on 125 000 we have to pay the price of a cheaper car to replace the engine. For nearly a month we did not have a car. 
Top quality, reliability, exemplary comfort was not part of our deal.<br><br>
