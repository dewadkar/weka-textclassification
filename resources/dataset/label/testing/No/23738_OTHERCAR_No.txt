            I've heard great things about Volkswagen and members of my family have had good luck with theirs. I decided to try Patrick Motors in Auburn MA for my Jetta GL

Since I've bought the car it has revved at 4500-5000 rpms, which is way too high. According to Volkswagen, it should be at 2500-3000. Now I'm no mechanic, but it does appear I would have a problem. You try to accelerate, but the car continuously feels like it wants you to shift. The only thing is, I have an automatic. Once it does kick into gear and drop down in rpms, it does so with a strong jerking motion. Every person who has ever been in this car has commented on this. Every time I bring it to the dealership they say there is nothing wrong with the car. It has been to the dealership at least 5 time for the same problem!

The radio has also been replaced and the passenger side molding has been replaced twice, and a tire had to be replaced at 10k miles too.

The worst part is, I like the size of the car, and the interior comfort and if my car ran good, I think I could love it!

I bought a new car for reliability and efficiency. The 98 Jetta and its service departments have shown me neither. I don't know which is worse, the dealership service, or the Jetta itself. 

Buyer beware!<br><br>
