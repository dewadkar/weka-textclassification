  I recently purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  I debated for a long time whether to get the Laredo or the Limited version.  The Limited edition comes standard with leather interior and the grill and lower portion of the Jeep is one color.  The Laredo has a grey cladding surrounding the lower portion and the grill is chrome.  The Limited has dual climate controls for the passenger and driver, memory seats, and a different 4WD system then the Laredo.  The Limited also tacks on an additional $4,000.  In the end, I opted to get the Laredo with a the options I wanted. These included heated leather seats, moonroof, tow hitch, 10 disc CD-player, auto-dimmer on the mirrors, and the full sized spare.  

  I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  Not only is the ride smooth, but it handles very well.  I am from New England, so it is great to have on the fly 4 wheel drive too.  It feels like a luxury car, yet has plenty of power and traction to go anywhere.  

  The only con I have is the gas mileage. I opted for the V6 in  order to save money on gas.  Even with the smaller engine, I still only average around 17 mpg.  <br><br>
