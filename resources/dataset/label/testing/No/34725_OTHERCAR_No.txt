            My 2000 Sebring Limited has 28000 miles on it in the 32 months thaty I have driven it.  Below follows a list of what has been fixed so far on it, and  the number of times each item  has been fixed:

Leaky driver side back window seal (lets enough water in to  short out the speakers)--gave up having this fixed after 4 or 5 tries

Top doesn't line up correctly half the time-dealership tells me I don't know what I am talking about; gave up trying to get this addressed

Leaky passenger front seal-gave up trying to get this fixed after 4th try

The windows are supposed to come down part way every time the top is raised or lowered.  This actually occurs less than 50 percent of the time.  Dealership finds no problem here either.

Speakers begin to rattle at even moderate volume (dealership tells me that my radio is too loud and what do I expect if I play the radio too loud)

Tires are made of soft rubber- I'm trying to eek out the last 4 months of my lease without killing myself on seriously worn tires (I do not drive this car like a porsche either)

Rear defroster has broken 3 times; each time the rear glass needs to be removed at an upholstry shop and then it needs to be restitched back in.  They don't get my car back to me in under 2 days, usually.  And forget about getting a loaner car, even though they sold me this POS

Every piece of the interior rattles.  This is to be expected to a degree in a convertible, but the even fake wood molding rattles in this car.

The headlights couldn't light up a garage full of mirrors.

There are a few good points to this car.  IF you aren't expecting rain, driving with the top down is a lot of fun.  There is surprisingly little wind noise with the top down. 
The back seat can sit 2 normal sized adult without ANY problem.  The trunk is roomy ( but the threshold is high, so if you have something big, it still may not be able to get into the trunk).  The radio/stereo system with CD player sounds good and is easy to use (too bad the speakers rattle so much).
