            We had only a few simple requirements while searching for a new digital camera and the <b>Fuji FinePix A200 Digital Camera</b> seemed to fill the bill in every category.  Simple "point and shoot" ease of use, compact and lightweight camera body, minimum 2.0 megapixels and of course, an easy to swallow price.  You would think after three years here at Epinions, I would resist an impulse buy of this magnitude and use the resources available to me.  I probably should have short-circuited the search and emailed Epinions' master of cameras, <a href="/user-howard_creech">Howard_Creech</a>, for his knowledgeable advice but I opted to roll the dice and check this camera out for myself.

<b>Why bother with digital cameras?</b>

First, I never intended this to replace my old Nikon F 35mm camera.  On instances where I've got both the time and patience as well as the desire for more professional results, I will continue to use the old standby.  We became weary of the routine of dragging a roll of film up to the local Meijers and waiting days for processing.  Many times we would return to the store and open the envelope of pictures only to find and pay for 36 double prints, most of which were useless.  Imagine us treasuring the entire contents of the envelope, the back of Uncle Leo's bald head, the carpet in the back seat of the Envoy and my daughter's knee when she accidentally snapped the shutter or the five shots of Kramer, our Lhasa-poo, that my wife took to "use up the roll".

If the stacks of useless pictures were not reason enough to pick this camera up then surely the past missed photo opportunities were.  Digital photography will allow you to see the botched picture immediately and simply erase the image on the spot and retake your shot before Aunt Hilda heads back home to Pittsburgh.  Digital cameras also allow you to download your pictures to your computer or CD's for safe-keeping.  The digital images are also already in the format to email instantly to friends and family with no need for scanning.  If those are not reason enough, then be advised digital cameras also end up saving money, eliminating film costs and processing fees on those unwanted pictures. 

<b>Lens and Exposure Control</b>

The <b>Fuji FinePix A200 Digital Camera</b> has an aperture range of f4.6 - f9.5, which is automatically selected.  The normal focal range of this camera is rated at 31.5 in. to infinity with a macro range of 3.1 in. to 5.1 in. Shutter speed ranges from 1/2 sec to 1/1000 sec. In addition, Fuji offers a 2.5x zoom lens on this particular model.

On the positive side, the shutter speed on this model is fairly quick for everyday picture taking in auto mode.  Unfortunately, this positive point is lost due to the fact the zoom on this model is almost useless.  I attempted to use the zoom feature during my daughter's graduation and was disappointed that it did almost nothing to enhance the final product.  This was definitely not the day to discover my camera's zoom was a useless feature.

I also found the macro function to offer adequate but certainly not professional results.  I was attempting to photograph several items for future online auctions and was eventually able to save several pictures, but not without multiple attempts.  I eventually accepted results which I considered "good enough" but nothing that matched many I have witnessed from what I assume have been shot with the higher priced competitor's camera's.

<b>Image Quality</b>

With the standard 16 MB memory card included with the <b>Fuji FinePix A200 Digital Camera</b>, users can store 25 images in Fine Mode and 39 images in Standard Mode at a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels.  At a resolution of 1280 x 960, this camera will store up to 49 images and 122 images at 640 x 480 pixels.

Again, image quality is decent but certainly not up to my expectations of digital photography.  The images I have seen thus far are no better than many I have taken over the years with my Nikon 35mm and something less than results I have seen from various other digital cameras on the market.

<b>Memory</b>
 
Included with this camera, you will find a 16 MB xD picture memory card.  The <b>Fuji FinePix A200 Digital Camera</b> will accept memory upgrades up to 128 MB.  With a DPC-128 (128 MB) memory card, users can store anywhere from 204 to 997 images, depending on mode and resolution choices.  Images are stored in a standard JPEG format for easy availability with most software programs.

<b>Power</b>

Fuji has designed this camera to be powered off 2 AA type batteries.  The manufacturer surprisingly includes two regular alkaline batteries in the package.  They claim that power consumption is minimal and users can shoot up to 270 images with two regular alkaline batteries.  From my experience, this claim is wildly exaggerated. Even using the <i>Power Save</i> option and turning the LCD screen off, I have been unable to muster half this amount.

The A200 usually powers up and is ready to shoot in less than two seconds, an extremely important point when a photo opportunity quickly "develops".  Sorry but I just couldn't resist using a lame pun!

<b>Movie Mode and Features</b>
 
Fuji gives users the ability to shoot movies without sound for up to 20 seconds with the fine setting and up to 80 seconds in normal mode.  Motion pictures are stored in standard MPEG format.  The included 16 MB xD card has the ability to store from 94 seconds to 5 minutes, depending on the compression mode selected.  Upgrading to a DPC-32(32 MB), DPC-64(64 MB) or DPC-128 memory card will increase movie storage to 3.1 minutes with the 32 MB card to over 40 minutes with the 128 MB card, depending on the selected resolution.

<b>Interfaces</b>
 
The <b>Fuji FinePix A200 Digital Camera</b> uses a standard USB interface for quick and simple downloading of files to any USB interface.

<b>Viewfinder/LCD Display</b>

The viewfinder is an inverted Galiean finder with 80% field of coverage.  This camera is equipped with a 1.5" LCD display rated at 55,000 pixels.  Depressing the <i>Disp</i> in view mode allows the user the choice to view stored images frame by frame or a paged thumbnail view.

In still photography mode, the <i>Disp</i> button gives users the option to turn off the LCD display for extending battery life or adding framing guidelines to aid in positioning and centering shots.

<b>Finepix Software</b>

Fuji has included the Finepix Viewer software CD in each package.  The software was easy to install and intuitive as well as simple to work with.  Once your software is loaded on your computer, simply plug the camera on the end of the USB cable and Finepix Viewer starts automatically.  A visual thumbnail for each frame will load within your Finepix Viewer software session.  Any computer user that has spent more that 15 minutes with Windows Explorer will master use of this picture viewing software instantly. 

<b>Included in the Box</b>

The <b>Fuji FinePix A200 Digital Camera</b> package also includes one 16MB xD Picture Card, Hand Strap, 2 AA alkaline Batteries and the Finepix software CD-ROM.

<b>Final Thoughts and Recommendations</b>

This camera's <i>Auto</i> feature, for the most part, does offer us the simple "point and click" type picture taking abilities I had set out to find.  While this camera is by no means the smallest on the market today, at 1.6" x 2.5" x 3.9" and .29 lbs. I feel my second requirement was also fulfilled.  Fuji has given me the lightweight and convenient sized camera I desired.  I was told to purchase a digital camera rated at no less than 2.0 megapixels, and again my basic requirement was met.  Lastly I was looking for a relatively inexpensive camera and I have to admit, my reasoning for purchasing the <b>Fuji FinePix A200</b> was based in large part on price.  The $149.00 purchase price was much easier to swallow than the tags I saw on most of the options.

Despite the fact that all my original requirements were met and the <b>Fuji FinePix A200</b> has performed fairly well, I am not offering my buy recommendation on this camera.  My experience with this, my first, digital camera over the past 10 months leads me to believe that maybe I should have expected more from a digital camera.  My guess is that with falling prices over the past 10 months and the incredible amount of options on the market today, there are better options available.  Howard, keep an eye on your email inbox, the next time I'm enlisting your help.
