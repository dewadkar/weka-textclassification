            my husband and i leased a 98 toyo tacoma in july of 98.  at first, i thought it was pretty good, even though i wanted an suv.  it was a joy to drive after our 84 cadillac cimarron.  one problem is that it had an automatic, which to my mind is a waste on a truck.  we took it everywhere and some places, it didn't want to go.  we got stuck in the ozark hills, and that was bad.  winter driving was acceptable, and rain driving was good.  we had the king cab, and let me assure you that that was at the best a prince cab.  i had trouble putting a child of five in those seats.  the mileage was terrible, though only to be expected with an automatic, i suppose.  i was involved in a crash, and everyone came out fine, so i feel as though the crashworthyness is adequate.  overall, i would have to say that this truck is NOT for anyone with children, and if you plan to go anywhere off the beaten path, get the four wheel variety.  <br><br>
