            This is the second Digital Camera that I own and to be quite honest, the only reason why I bought it was because a friend needed the money and sold it to me cheap. The QV-10A was one of the first Digital Cameras that made it out on the market that was affordable to the everyday Joe (the cost at the time was around $200).
The Camera itself is well built and the ability to swivel the lens around allows you to shoot a picture while looking at the built in screen. Like all Digitals with built in view screens, it eats batteries. You only get about 2 hours to a set, so buying the additional power supply is a must, especially with the slow download time.
For the technology level at the time it was introduced to the public, it does take some pretty good pictures and is very simple to operate. The only drawback being that when you start to edit those pictures, the resolution is so low that you can't zoom in on any one part of the picture without running into the square pixel matrix quickly. To overcome this, I have found that adding a slight blur (or soften) to the picture makes it look more lifelike.
The lack of a flash is also a draw back, and the camera does medium to poor indoors. You'll also find that some outside shots, depending on the light source, will have the color bleached out. The software is simple to use and has some good editing features, but the software alone does not warrant buying this camera.
If you want to invest money in a good Digital Camera that has great picture quality, then this is not the choice you want to make. Save up and look at the Olympus line, a friend has one and the pictures I've seen come out of it are almost film quality. Better yet, don't waste your money on anything with less than a Megapixel of resolution.<br><br>
