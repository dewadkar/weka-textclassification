            When I think of Lexus, my mind immediately creates a vision of luxury. Leather seats with 'bum-warmers' (my mother's words, not mine), ultimate climate control, smooth lines, leg room to spare... the very essence of car creature comforts. The RX300 has all of these things, and if you're looking for a car simply to be comfortable in, it is very likely your thing.

<b>Why I don't like the <i>RX300</i>...</b>
I don't think the RX300 lives up to its price tag. The turn radius on this SUV is pathetic - it is near impossible to park all in one turn, and turning around in anything smaller than a parking lot is a joke. Our driveway is wide-enough to accommodate a three-car garage and approximately two-third that length to form a rectangular turn around area before branching out to the street. Still, it is barely enough (when empty of all other cars) to allow the RX300 to turn around - from its facing into the garage bay until facing out towards the street. In fact, the 1988 Volvo station wagon I drove previous to the RX300 had a better turning radius.

The accelerator on the RX300 is touchy to the point of jerking your passenger about, that is, until you've grown used to it. In stark contrast, I've found the brakes to be very soft... when you hard break, it takes a lot longer than one would expect given the amount of money you are spending on a car.

The mileage per gallon on this beast is also saddening. In a state (CT) where gas prices have topped $2 ($2.09 for premium 06/27... the only gas the RX300 is supposed to use), it is an investment simply to drive to work! And it's hard on the environment to boot! It's getting to the point where we look for excuses <i>not</i> to drive the RX300, simply because we can't see it being worth the extra gas costs over our other cars.

<i>Updates: 03/25/01</i>
It's been a while since I've updated this review, and with good reason. Lately, our <i>RX300</i> hasn't been performing very well, and I wanted to verify that it was a consistent thing rather than a series of isolated incidents.

Problems:

*  Bad speaker: About four to five months ago, the front-right speaker started to fritz. It doesn't happen all the time, but seems to be aggravated by turning. Rather than giving out music, we'd get static or nothing at all. We took it back to the dealer, and asked him to fix it. He kept it for *3* days, ran it for *50 miles* and couldn't find a problem. When asked if he tried tight turns during this inspection, he said, 'Well, I drove 50 miles...' Not very impressive.
*  Rear brake lights: Not long after purchase, our left brake light started to fritz also. Sometimes it would work, other times it wouldn't. We took it in to the dealer, who replaced the light. The problem was still there. We took it back again, and this time he checked the wiring. He told us everything was fine, and replaced the bulb again. The problem is still there.

Perhaps the overall problem here is a lack of service from the dealership, rather than the car itself, but it is still something to be aware of. Our warranty ran out, and now we're paying out the nose for really crummy service. Its so bad, in fact, that we've decided to stop going to the dealer, and start going to our regular mechanic.

<b>Still...</b>
Overall, if you are interested solely in creature comforts, then the RX300 is for you. The sound system is fantastic (we have the 6 disc changer, which stows nicely in the glove box - a must for those cross country trips!), the seats are plush, and everyone gets their own climate controller. The wood trim is aesthetically beautiful, and even the back seat is spacious. However, if you are more interested in performance, you might want to check out the competition - the Jeep Grand Cherokee is an excellent example of what a 'luxury SUV' can be, when built correctly. Or, for a better deal entirely, check out the Subaru Forester - much cheaper, and a great deal more bang for your buck.
