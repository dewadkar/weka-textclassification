            Well first, I am not the true owner of the car - my boyfriend is, yet I feel I know enough about it to let prospective buyers know our experiences with it. His is a Black 2-door GT (I believe) with most of the goodies. Heads-Up-Display; sunroof; power everything...etc. When it was first bought, about 3 years ago, the car was absolutely wonderful. It was considered a fast car with a lot of power under the hood and had a lot of pick-up. The stereo is excellent and so is the seating. I thought the fact that the stereo controls are on the steering wheel was quite unique. At that time, I would have recommended the car to anyone. Recently though it seems like the car has just gotten worse and everything has started to go all at the same time. 
In the past year, the drivers seat broke. He leaned back on it a little to get comfortable like he always does, and it snapped. And it is now stuck in a half-reclined position and its somewhat twisted sideways, but since he�s such a big guy and he�s the only one who drives the car, he doesn�t mind. The alternator broke. The mechanic that he goes to, charged him $530 to fix it (which personally I believe is a rip-off). Because of the problems with the brakes for that years model, on average, he would go through 4 sets of brakes each year. 
Right now, his car is in need of  a whole new exhaust system, shocks, struts, and god only knows what else. The car has no power left to it. It used have a lot of pick-up. Now, while on the highway, when he tries to accelerate, the car strains, yet only goes about 5-10 miles faster. Not to mention that because of the exhaust problem, you can now hear the rumbling sound of his car coming when its still far down the road. The car feels as though it is �on its last legs.�
There are also some small things, that are hardly worth mentioning. For instance, the lever to pull to open the hood broke off and in order to open the hood we have to use a pair of pliers to pull on the cable that pops the hood. The lights for the heat/air conditioning do not light up anymore; only on very rare occasions. And also the sunroof makes a whistling noise when it is closed and the windows are up, but it doesn�t leak. It just becomes quite annoying on long trips in the rain.
And as far as safety goes, I believe the car is reliable for the most part. My boyfriend has hit a few deer (very hard) and has been in two accidents, where the other car looked like hell and his had relatively minor repairs. The car seems to be a �beast� in that area.
Overall, I would advise a prospective buyer to definitely have a warranty on the car to be safe. The car is generally reliable where as you do not have to worry about repairs that may leave you stranded on the road, yet be prepared to replace brakes frequently.
As for his Grand Prix, since there are too many things that broke all at one time and would cost too much money (that we don�t have) to replace, we plan to use my car primarily (since we work together anyway) until his dies. We use it now, only as a �back up� because the car is still �his baby� and he refuses to get rid of it (no matter how much I pester) and he says he will run it into the ground before he just gives up and gets rid of it. I hope our situation can aide any prospective buyers so at least you have an idea of what you may be in store for in both the good and the bad.
