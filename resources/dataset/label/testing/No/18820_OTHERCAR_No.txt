                Hi, I hope you read this and consider my personal opinion before purchasing your next Jeep Cherokee.
    I am twenty-five and have already owned four new vehicles. The last three of which were Jeeps. I am sad to say I am extremely disappointed with my current 1998 Jeep Cherokee. I am not only let down by the vehicle itself but, also by the service that came with it. I currently have 34,000 miles on my car and have had two sets of rotors. The second set of which I have just needed re-machined! This I found is not covered under there so called Bumper-to-Bumper warranty. The brakes are only covered by a one year or 12,000 mile warranty which, I can understand. However, I explained to the sales manager that this vehicle has a history of brake problems and I feel that do to this being the second set of rotors in two years that this procedure should be covered. He then informed me that Cherokees are known for this kind of brake problem and that I should expect that the rotors will need turn every 6,000 thousand miles, to avoid warping. I have had my share of vehicles and take very good care of them and have never had another car that has had this kind of problem. I have also had several electronic problems with the instrument gauges. None of which they have ever track down to a specific part and fixed. Sure, I bet there are lemons in every car manufactured, but I personally would not recommended to a friend or a stranger for that matter, to purchase a Jeep. I feel that customer satisfaction is not a priority or even a concern for that matter with Jeep or Chrystler Corp. They have lost a loyal customer who has purchase three new jeeps in the last four years over a $75.00 brake job. To me there is nothing more to say! *Have wrote to the Chrystler Corp. and as of 12-16-99 have not received any response from them...Seems like there attitude with customer relations is the same all the way at the top.
