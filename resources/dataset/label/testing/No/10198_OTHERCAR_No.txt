            After much thought on what two new cars to buy for my wife and I, and after looking at the RX300, 4Runner Limited, Ford Explorer V8 Eddie Bauer, and Mercury Mountaineer with Luxury package, we finally narrowed our two cars down to the RX300 and Ford Explorer V8 Eddie Bauer.  The 4Runner is underpowered, and is cramped inside, so why pay $40,000 for that?  We still like the Mountaineer, and they are cheaper than the Explorer, but we liked the some aspects of the Explorer better such as the fog lights, and wheel flares available on all editions.  Enough said on the Explorer, at least until I explain my reasonings about the RX300.  After test driving the RX300 two times at the dealership, and then driving our friends RX300 on a short road trip, we decided that it was a mini-van designed to look like an SUV.  The ride was smooth, and the overall power is okay, but not the greatest.  We had a hard time climbing hills, although there aren't many around here.  The seats were comfortable, but not after a couple hours of driving.  The touch screen design of the radio appealed to us, but it is difficult to see the screen after finger prints get on it, or dust.  The overall quality of the screen, well, lets say its easiest to make it out at night.  We didn't have many turns that to make the days we drove them, so we couldn't feel that the RX300 is top heavy.  Also, we had no hard stopping to do, so we didn't get a feel as to how the brakes are.  There is literally no cargo space in the rear of the RX300.  Lets just say you can fit more under the dash of a Yugo than you can in the cargo area of the RX300.  We had to fold down the rear seat just to be able to fit in our two suitcases.  We put a tool box back there, and it took up all the space.  After buying the RX300 in the Maroon color with a beige leather interior with moonroof and all options for the amount of $37,865, we realized we had made a mistake buying the Lexus over another Explorer or a Mountaineer.  The RX300 is top heavy, and you feel it with gusts of wind are a hard turn.  The brakes didn't stop the car as fast as they should.  Overall, I rank the RX300 a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the worst, and 10 being the best.  Although the Lexus doesn't have as much of a plastic interior as the Explorer, the Explorer overall is a nicer vehicle for the money.  We ended up selling the RX300 (still on lease, so there was a penalty) and bought another Explorer, but this time, in the Limited Edition.  Both of our Explorers are V8s and two wheel drive, and come with features that you can never get on the Lexus such as systems check, etc.  Also, there is much more cargo room in the Explorer, and the power of the V8 is great for towing.  The seats are comfortable, and the Explorers do not feel top heavy.  The ride is smooth, and we have no problems on hills like we did with the RX300.  One Explorer is Toreador Red two toned with the standard beige which comes with the Eddie Bauer edition, and then the Limited Edition is solid white.  We love both of the Explorers, and together, make a monthly lease payment of $1012 a month, compared to $1256 a month with the Explorer and RX300.  Overall, if you want a true SUV, and not a mini-van made to look like an SUV, buy an Explorer or Mountaineer.  If you want the ride quality of a van and don't need to tow, buy a RX300.<br><br>
