            When my Mercury Sable was totaled, I began searching for a reliable car and while driving the interim rental, a Chevrolet Lumina, my lower back never felt better.  Four days after purchasing my 1998 Accord, I was in pain which increases the more time I spend driving this car.  The seats are like boards, offer insufficient leg  and back support  and even an upholsterer couldn't make them more comfortable. In fact, I was told they receive frequent complaints about Honda seats.

Everything else about this car is great - it handles well, good sound system and is very reliable.  But if you have back problems, keep looking!<br><br>
