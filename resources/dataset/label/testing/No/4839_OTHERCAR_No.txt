            we rented this car from Dollar for $50/day including insurance ($10/day) &amp; all taxes (25%) at Las Vegas airport (took the shuttle bus) for 8 days in May 2000.

we drove it about 200 miles mostly in city traffic
the torque seemed lower than a caddy we had rented a year earlier,
it just seemed like a less powerful engine in the same size car
when you hit the gas, there was a jerk when it shifted
(auto) that was not present in the caddy (4-door)

the seats were good but the caddy's were better
the music system (about 8 speakers i think) was awesome
we loved the compass &amp; therm on the overhead console
and the individual reading lights for passengers

its not quite a freeway cruiser like the caddy and we could only
take it up to around 85 - 90mph before we got worried about getting ticketed

we hated the fact that the radio/cd controls were not duplicated
on the steering wheel which every luxury car should have

we could not figure out how to make the climate control system remember
some of our settings (it remembered the temp but was not a dual system)
we had to keep setting it on 'internal/recirculate' whenever we started
the car which was a little annoying

the rear visibility was very poor (just like the caddy)
i don't know why they don't design larger rear mirrors and
back windows on large cars

it was a pain to back into any spot

i much prefer the saab 9-5 to this car but it might be more expensive

the trunk was large, roomy, and light
my wife had no trouble opening it as opposed to her G20 (compact sedan)
which is a lot heavier and harder to lift up

on a 40 mile drive out of vegas, we noticed the car became very
hard to control and it felt like it was going at 100 mph
when we were at 75
i think that was due to strong crosswinds as opposed to the car
