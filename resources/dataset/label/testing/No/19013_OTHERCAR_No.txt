            Two days ago I had to take a trip to Philadelphia (100 miles each way).  I was trying to save my company some money, so I rented Dodge NEON(the cheapest rental from Enterprise).  By the end of my trip I have formed a mostly negative opinion of Neon.
Here is the list of the things I liked/disliked about the V (I will go into details below).
I did like: Front legroom, gas mileage, and handling
I did not like:  acceleration, loud engine, seating position, road noise.

The exterior of the Neon is somewhat bland and is not an eye catcher by any means.  The interior plastics and controls are made of cheap plastic and you get a feeling that the handles/knobs/buttons will come off fairly easy.  The seats are somewhat comfortable, and the cloth surfaces are of decent quality for this class car.  Once you get behind the steering wheel, you feel like you are seating in the back seat (the distance between the front seats and the windshield is much larger than you would expect in a car of the size of Neon).  The radio controls reminded me of a $25 off-brand radio you can buy in China town.  Switching the radio from AM to FM almost requires for you to pull over and stop, since it is hidden somewhere in the middle of the same looking buttons.  Climate controls are easy and intuitive.  The lighting of the dashboard is better than in some of the more expensive cars. The side mirrors are small, thus you have to look hard over your shoulders before you change lanes.  That brings us to&#133.driving.
Driving:  Neon is LOUD!!!  You feel it as soon as you start the car, more when you step on the gas.  I drove Neon mostly on the highway and when you go over 60 mph., you get this feeling of a stick shift car in the 3rd gear doing 70.  I had to make the radio much louder just to listen to the news.  I pushed the Neon to 85, but had to go back to 65 because I thought I would blow the engine.  With all fairness, I have to say that the car handles pretty good.  The exit ramps and turns are not a problem.  The lean is virtually non-existent and the steering is responsive and fairly precise.  Braking is descent and the stopping distance is average.  
At the end of my trip I felt exhausted and had a slight headache from all the noise, thus I would not recommend this car if you plan to take trips longer than 10 miles.
