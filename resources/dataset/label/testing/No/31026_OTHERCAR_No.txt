            Chrysler Sebring LXI 2002

Slight Disappointment

Just last November before our departure for Asia, my wife and I went on a tour to visit friends and relatives in Canada and in the United States. On one of the last day of our tour before the grand departure, we had to return a car we had rented in Las Vegas. The car was a Chrysler Sebring coupe 2000.

We drove the car for a few days on a trip to San Diego and returned through Arizona. I felt that it was a decent car and I had even thought of the possibility of writing a review about it at the time.

Return the car at Mc Caron Airport and flew to Toronto. At our arrival we immediately went to the car rental counter and were offered a Sebring Coupe 2002. Well I accepted, thinking what an opportunity to make a comparison.

After a few days of driving the Sebring 2002 in and around Toronto, here are my findings and the comparison between the two vehicles.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The 2002 Sebring is the second generation Chrysler is marketing. I must say that as I said earlier, driving the 2000 model was an OK experience. Not much to write about the car handled well on the highway, a bit a pain to drive around town, the interior of the cabin very cheap looking but still practical.  The Sebring 2000 as a whole is quite acceptable for a medium priced car rental.

Now the 2002 Sebring is a little more interesting. Daimler-Chrysler has given this coupe a very clean style. With a diving hood that ends a large oval air scoop, add to this the fog lights that are incorporated within the headlights
giving the Sebring a touch of European coupe design and the car mounted on 17 inches wheels is definitely an eye catcher at first glance.

One of the first thing I had noticed with the 2000 model was the oversized and fairly heavy doors, on the 2002 model it still has these oversized doors but I did notice that they are quite lighter than the ones on the previous year model.

As for an interior comparison, in both models when you enter you feel as if you are going to sit on the pavement. Plus even though there was some quality improvement made on the 2001 Sebring, it still has these cheap looking and ugly
plastic trims in the inside or the car.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior

It is in the interior of the Sebring that I was mostly disapointed with. When you first look at the exterior of this car and admire its elegance you would expect the feeling to be carried inside but it did not, as for the 2000 Sebring Chrysler Kept the cheap plastic trims and this does take away from the car.

Another point I was unhappy with is the fact that when you enter this car you have a feeling that you are about to sit on the road. It seems as if the seats are very low. Add this to the fact that the rear trunk is at high altitude it
will definitely affect your rear vision.

Talking of bad rear vision, any of your passengers sitting on the rear seats will have a very hard time seeing any thing outside. It seems as if the rear side windows were not installed for the rear passengerï¿½s benefits. Now I can not compare this point with the 2000 model because I did not notice at the time how the rear windows for the Sebring were positioned.

I did however like the new steering and the controls are gauges are all well located for the driver.

The exterior

Contrary to the interior, the exterior of the 2002 Sebring is very impressive.

The first look at the lines of this car will give you an impression of European elegance. I was even very surprised by the muffled sound from the door when I closed it the first time. The sound was as if I had entered a Lincoln.

The side view mirrors are very stylish but they will give you a large blind spot. I once owned a car that had an even worst blind spot and after a few near misses, I solved the problem by purchasing a pair of oval mirrors from The Pep
Boys for $4.50 and stuck them on the lower corner of each mirror and that solved the problem. I believe that any one buying a 2001 Sebring Coupe may have to do the same.

The trunk will give you lots of room for luggage and equipment. But if you have anything heavy to put in the trunk, try to get help, because you have to lift
very high whatever you want to transport in the trunk.

THE ROAD TEST

Well I must say that there is a big difference between driving the two cars. 

Contrary to the 2000 model the new Sebring has a little more spunk to it. Now do not get me wrong, this is not a car to enter in any race. At lest the way they come from the factory. I am just saying that it is a better car to drive on the
highway.

I did notice that breaking with the new model was better. At one point I had to suddenly apply the breaks on wet pavement and the car handled very well.

As for the 2000 model, city driving is a bit tougher. Partly because of the fact that the rear vision is restraint and also because this car needs a lot of room
and I mean a lot of room to complete a turn. An old desert camel can probably make a sharper turn than the 2002 Sebring.
